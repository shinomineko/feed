                    <span>Respawn has opened up about the cost of premium items in Apex Legends&#x27; in-game store. 
In a recent Reddit AMA, players pointed out that the cost of premium skins can cost around 1800 Apex Coins - which is the equivalent to $18 (£13) give or take.
&quot;I get that you gotta make the game profitable, but there&#x27;s gotta be a way to prevent the player from feeling cheated when they buy something,&quot; pointed out Redditor x5hadau.

                    <span>A French retailer has seemingly leaked an &quot;EU version&quot; of Sonic Collection for PlayStation 4.
It&#x27;s the same company that may have outed that Sonic Colors remaster a few weeks back, too.
French site Sogamely boasts no cover art or release date, and right now only lists the game as coming to PS4 &quot;soon&quot;. While that can only put this firmly in the take-with-a-giant-bucket-of-salt category, we do know that Sega is currently busy celebrating 30 years of Sonic, so a game collection is certainly a possibility (thanks, VGC). We&#x27;ve reached out to Sega for comment, though, and will update as/when we hear back.

                    <span>Unhappy Elite Dangerous: Odyssey PC players are hitting developer Frontier where it hurts - Steam reviews.
The new content, Odyssey, released on 19th May, is allegedly causing all kinds of problems, with reports of crashes, poor performance, bugged missions, and poor optimisation according to recent reviews left on the game&#x27;s Steam page.
The feedback now aggregates over 3000 reviews, 2.2K of which are deemed &quot;mostly negative&quot;, despite a second hotfix that rolled out on Friday in a bid to address the game&#x27;s stability (thanks, NME).

                    <span>Twitch is introducing 350+ new community tags that will enable streamers not just to tag the content of the games they&#x27;re playing, but also &quot;who they are and what they [stand] for&quot;, too.
&quot;We had planned to share this next week, but we&#x27;ve heard a lot of you talking and want to make sure the record is clear. Next week we&#x27;ll be adding 350+ new tags to celebrate yourself and your community,&quot; explained a tweet on the official Twitch Twitter account over the weekend.
The new tags - which were drawn up in consultation with &quot;independent, third-party organisations&quot; and &quot;other experts focused on the progress of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, LGBTQIA+, disabled, and marginalized communities&quot; - are &quot;related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, mental health, and more&quot;.

                    <span>Ten years after its original release, it looks like a Crysis 2 remaster is in development.
The official Crysis Twitter account dropped the tease earlier this week with two tweets. The first states &quot;They used to call me Prophet&quot; - which refers to Crysis 2 character Major Laurence &quot;Prophet&quot; Barnesa - and then a follow-up tweet gives away nowt but the wide-eyes emoji.
The following day, it shared a screenshot from Crysis 2 and yet another eyes emoji.

                    <span>Bungie has banned one of the first players to complete the refreshed Vault of Glass raid after their username appeared on the World&#x27;s First Raid Report page.
While Clan Elysium was the world&#x27;s first to complete the new raid in 1hr 43m and 55s, the second team included on the World&#x27;s First page - which finished the raid in 2hr 24m and 16s - has just five names listed.
That&#x27;s because the sixth person, using the gamertag #BlackLivesDontMatter, has subsequently been banned and removed from the list.

                    <span>Do you like weird alien planets? Do you like building bases? Do you like defending those bases from weird aliens? Well it sounds like The Riftbreaker has all of those things, and you&#x27;ll be able to try it for yourself on Xbox Game Pass when it launches this autumn. 
As announced on Xbox Wire, The Riftbreaker will be available on Game Pass from day one. It&#x27;s described as a &quot;mix of base-builder, survival, and action-RPG&quot;. Players take on the role of Captain Ashley Nowak, a member of the &quot;elite Riftbreaker form…</span>

                    <span>A neat little Easter egg for the original Xbox has been revealed via Kotaku, two decades after Microsoft&#x27;s console first launched.
The hidden secret is a small, static credits screen dedicated to Xbox staff members which worked on the console&#x27;s now legendary green interface. (It&#x27;s a design Microsoft recently honoured with a throwback theme on Xbox Series X/S.)
Kotaku was recently contacted by an anonymous Xbox developer who worked on the console way back when - and who had decided enough time had passed tha…</span>

Hello Games&#x27; effervescent space sim No Man&#x27;s Sky is getting in on the big-brand crossover action, and you&#x27;re currently able to unlock a little piece of BioWare&#x27;s Mass Effect to treasure forever in-game in the form of your very own SSV Normandy SR1.

                    <span>A Red Dead Redemption 2 VR mod has launched in early access form.
It&#x27;s the work of developer Luke Ross, who has form when it comes to VR mods. He built the eye-catching VR mod for Grand Theft Auto 5 our Ian Higton enjoyed last year.
The video below from UploadVR gives us a good idea of how it works in combination with a gamepad. It&#x27;s early days, but it&#x27;s cool to see Rockstar&#x27;s epic in VR. The cutscenes work in VR, too.

Over the past few days players have taken to social media to report more DDoS attacks on both Titanfall and Titanfall 2, resulting in both regular players and content creators being booted from servers (or unable to connect at all). This time the attacks seem particularly severe, as Titanfall 2 streamers have said they are being &quot;blacklisted&quot; by the hacker so that t…</span>

But one change it failed to mention that arrived as part of this week&#x27;s mid-season three update was a lighting makeover for Rebirth Island.
Rebirth Island, the smaller, and dare I say it more fun of the two maps available to play in Activision&#x27;s battle royale, is brighter now, with a soft blue, &#x27;80s-inspired colour palette. It&#x27;s certainly nicer to look at,…</span>

Last year, a long-lost prototype of the Xbox console exclusive running on PS3 came to light, courtesy of self-proclaimed former hacker PixelButts. Eight hours of footage was released showing the build being played, with only a couple of bugs. This footage is still available to view - Epic hasn&#x27;t attempted to take it down:

From 25th to 27th May, Bungie will deploy a unique Vanguard Strikes crossplay beta playlist to test what works and find out what doesn&#x27;t. 
Anyone on PlayStation, Steam, Xbox and even Stadia can take part. Play three Strikes in the playlist and you&#x27;ll get a special emblem for your trouble.

                    <span>Overwatch 2 PvP is 5v5, Blizzard has said.
The developer released a video, below, detailing changes coming to PvP in the upcoming shooter.
Chief among them is the switch from 6v6 to 5v5. In the standard PvP game modes of Overwatch 2, each team contains one tank, two damage and two support characters. This makes for a significant shift, Blizzard said, in terms of map design and the dynamics between roles.

Emsisoft has identified two distinct tactics. In the first, hackers encrypt data with ransomware A and then re-encrypt that data with ransomware B. The other path involves what Emsisoft calls a “side-by-side encryption” attack, in which attacks encrypt some of an organization’s systems with ransomware A and others with ransomware B. In that case, data is only encrypted once, but a victim would need both decryption keys to unlock everything. The researchers also note that in th…</span>

That&#x27;s all we know for now. Injustice is of course a series of DC-flavoured fighting games from Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm. Injustice: Gods Among Us came out in 2013, before a sequel, Injustice 2, came out in May 2017.

                    <span>Die Hard&#x27;s John McClane hits Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops Cold War tomorrow, but we can see his in-game model now.
Once you&#x27;ve downloaded Black Ops Cold War&#x27;s latest update, which prepares the game for the mid-season three refresh, you can see McClane as a &quot;coming soon&quot; operator.
I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting! Call of Duty&#x27;s McClane looks a lot like McClane from the first Die Hard film, which is what you want, really.

                    <span>Nintendo has announced five more retro games for its Switch Online catalogue, bringing the service&#x27;s overall total of NES and SNES classics to 104. 
But while Nintendo noted it had passed the 100 game milestone, Nintendo fans are less impressed with the games on offer. 
May&#x27;s list of additions includes SNES games Caveman Ninja (also known as Joe &amp; Mac), Magical Drop 2, Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 and Spanky&#x27;s Quest, plus Ninja JaJaMaru-kun for NES. Here&#x27;s a look at all of those in action:

                    <span>Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, the new CGI series from Netflix, has today received a new trailer and an 8th July release date. 
Our best look yet at the Leon S. Kennedy-starring show, this two-minute montage has vomiting zombies, zombie rats and a hulking big thing which may be the series&#x27; big bad.

                    <span>Treyarch has added sniper flinch to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War as part of the game&#x27;s latest big update.
Black Ops Cold War Multiplayer fans have called for some form of sniper flinch ever since the game came out last year.
Flinch is the disruption caused to your aim when you&#x27;re hit by enemy fire. Sniper rifles are seen by some as overpowered in Black Ops Cold War because of their distinct lack of flinch.

                    <span>Nintendo has revealed a Zelda and Loftwing amiibo figurine which launches alongside its Skyward Sword HD remaster on 16th July.
Tapping the amiibo to your Switch lets you zip between the game&#x27;s airborne overworld and Hyrule&#x27;s surface, wherever you are - a handy feature not available in the original game. See this in action in the trailer below:

As well as Rambo and John McClane as brand new operators, and the baseball bat melee weapon and AMP63 pistol, Treyarch&#x27;s shooter gets two new Multiplayer maps, the new main quest for Zombies&#x27; Outbreak mode, and Rambo and Die Hard twists on classic game modes.

From 20th May, Nakatomi Plaza from Die Hard will appear in Downtown for a limited time. This is the tallest single structure seen in Warzone, and includes five floors of space Die Hard fans will find familiar.
Nakatomi Plaza replaces the Broadcast Tower and surrounding blocks in Downtown&#x27;s southern district. It houses multiple …</span>

                    <span>Activision has released a new trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone that shows off Rambo in action.
The video, below, reveals how Rambo looks in Activision&#x27;s mega-shooter. We see the &#x27;80s action hero leap out of a chopper at the start of a Warzone game, parachute into the action, and use his iconic bow and arrow. There&#x27;s a lot of shouting while firing guns, as you&#x27;d expect.
There&#x27;s a lot relating to Die Hard here, too. There&#x27;s a brief shot of what looks like Nakatomi Plaza in Warzone:

                    <span>Divinity: Original Sin 2 has been released on iPad and iPad Pro.
This is apparently a proper, full fat port. There are no surprise new microtransactions or anything like that. It&#x27;s the full game, Gift Bag DLCs included, as you remember it on PC or consoles. And it costs £23.99 (check regional pricing).
It&#x27;s been developed over two years by Larian and Russian partner Elveris. DOS2 iPad has touch controls, obviously, but also supports mouse and keyboard as well as game pads, such as the PS5 pad.

SnowRunner arrives for all Xbox Game Pass platforms today - coincidentally the day it confirmed a £20.99 Year 2 Pass for even more post-launch content.
PopCap puzzler Peggle 2 and third-person shooter Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighborville meanwhile both arrive on Thursday, 20th May for cloud devices via EA Play.

                    <span>The wonderful SnowRunner has today launched on Steam, Xbox Game Pass and Nintendo Switch alongside Season 4: New Frontiers - and we&#x27;ve got confirmation of a second year of post-launch support.
SnowRunner, which Christian Donlan described as a &quot;beautiful game about getting nowhere slowly&quot;, launched last year on the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
New Frontiers, meanwhile, is set in Amur Oblast, Russia, and provides 16 square kilometers of Russian wilderness to navigate for the rehabilitation of…</span>

                    <span>As resurfaced by Kotaku, this exploit is found on the planet of Noveria - so if you want to take advantage of having a full goodie-two-shoes reputation gauge, head there as quickly as you can. 
Having a beefy Paragon or Renegade points bar is important throughout Mass Effect, as it&#x27;ll allow you to resolve certain situations through dialogue and without things automatically playing out as a bloodbath.

                    <span>A teen footballer who was murdered in 2006 is now in FIFA 21.
Kiyan Prince was a 15-year-old playing for Queens Park Rangers when his life was tragically cut short in 2006 when he was stabbed while trying to break up a fight in school.
Now, 15 years later, EA has added Prince to the QPR squad in FIFA 21. He appears in the game as a 30-year-old.

If you hadn&#x27;t guessed already, the squabble is over the name Nreal, which Epic Games argues is deliberately similar to its own Unreal (thanks, The Verge). 
The two companies have been warring over the name for years, though this latest legal challenge from Epic appears to have been sparked by an Nreal boast it had &quot;big news&quot; - seemingly, that its Nreal smartglasses were being prepped for US …</span>

                    <span>Nintendo has shown off an extended look at several new modes coming to Mario Golf: Super Rush, as well as the game&#x27;s full character roster. 
Speed Golf is a fresh mode where players race each other on foot across the golf course in-between taking shots. (If only karts existed in Mario&#x27;s world!)
While dashing, players can use items to regain stamina and special attacks to thwack the ball/other players out of the way. (Seriously, why isn&#x27;t Mario Golf Kart a thing?)

When this problem is discussed, people regularly quote the statistic that 85% of US critical infrastructure is in private hands. It’s a handy number, and matches our intuition. Still, I have never been able to find a factual basis, or anyone who knows where the number comes from. Paul…</span>

Deleting objects in Kubernetes can be challenging. You may think you’ve deleted something, only to find it still persists. While issuing a kubectl delete command and hoping for the best might work for day-to-day operations, understanding how Kubernetes delete commands operate will help you understand why some objects linger after deletion.
In this post, I’ll look at:
What properties of a resource govern deletion
How finalizers and owner references impact object deletion

The gist of Knockout City is that, in time-honoured dodgeball style, two teams of players (either 3v3 or 4v4) battle it out for supremacy by lobbing balls at each other. It&#x27;s an easy to understand premise with a vibrantly approachable visual sheen, putting it on a collision course with  countless other offerings in the busy field of live-ser…</span>

                    <span>Another day, another game-breaking glitch in Call of Duty: Warzone. It wasn&#x27;t quite the infamous stim glitch, but the end result was similar, as this time players found an exploit that allowed them to create unbreakable gas masks. Thankfully, this particular method has now been patched out by Raven. 
In your average game of Warzone, masks are supposed to degrade when you sit outside the ring, eventually breaking so that you start taking damage from the gas (and die). Some players figured out a way to glitch…</span>

                    <span>Artwork revealing dozens of potential Fortnite characters has been posted online. 
Fortnite fans do not typically get to see the battle royale&#x27;s eye-catching characters until they&#x27;re added to the game&#x27;s files - and even then, some are encrypted so they&#x27;re a complete surprise until they go on sale. 
However, a new player survey has spilled onto the internet via LeakySussed - and among questions about the game itself there are dozens of unrevealed characters for fans to offer feedback on.

                    <span>Destiny 2&#x27;s new transmog system to change the appearance of items has come under further fire from fans, following its general release. 
In the run up to its long-awaited launch, players despaired at the announcement of its grind-heavy mechanics. Now it&#x27;s actually out in the wild, the criticism has continued. 
Chief among the complaints is the fact that Synthstrand, the base tier of three transmog currencies, appears to be time-gated.

                    <span>Blizzard has lowered the price of a cloned World of Warcraft Classic character following a backlash from players.
The company was set to charge $35 per character for an optional cloning service, which would let players keep playing the original World of Warcraft Classic content and The Burning Crusade content with the same character.
The $35 (around £25) price was roundly criticised by the World of Warcraft community as being too expensive - and Blizzard came under fire accordingly.

The cards will be pulled from all stores on 14th May, but will continue to be sold online.

                    <span>Rejoice, goths and people who just like their gaming peripherals to look sleek: a black version of the PlayStation 5&#x27;s DualSense controller has been announced, and will be available for purchase from next month. And for the flamboyant among you, there&#x27;s also a bold red. 
Announced via the PlayStation blog, the two new colours are themed around space and are officially called &quot;midnight black and cosmic red&quot;. The black apparently comes in &quot;two subtly different shades of black with light grey detailing&quot;, and y…</span>

In a press release, the ESA described the online portal and app as &quot;a key hub for the duration of the show&quot;. It will feature hosted events, virtual booths, online forums, video conferencing, and even profile and avatar creation. The exhibitor booths will h…</span>

Speaking to Wired, Guerilla confounder Hermen Hulst shared the numbers and said &quot;there&#x27;s an incredible amount of variety originating from different regions&quot; in the pipeline, with a mixture of &quot;big, small, different games&quot;.

For the first time, the United States will require all software purchased by the federal government to meet, within six months, a series of new cybersecurity standards.

The animated background, named &quot;The Original&quot;, is more akin to the loading animation you got when first turning on that chunky console rather than its actual dashboard, but the look will likely still feel familiar.

                    <span>Speaking with investors, Ubisoft financial boss Frederick Duguet said the company&#x27;s focus on releasing three to four big budget games per year was no longer &quot;a proper indication of our value creation dynamics&quot;. Or, in normal speak, Ubisoft wanted its profits to grow by making even more money from other things.
On Twitter, Ubisoft&#x27;s Sean Lama clarified this did not mean free-to-play games would replace AAA games. Instead, it meant Ubisoft now saw free-to-play as &quot;an additional way to experience some of these…</span>

                    <span>Ever since the new generation of consoles released at the end of last year, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles have suffered from stock shortages - and as a result of that, increased levels of scalping. The problem grew so severe that even British politicans began to pay attention. And with console shortages set to continue for the foreseeable future, it seems Microsoft is trialling a new way for customers to acquire a console - without everything being ruined by scalper bots.

                    <span>Bungie has acknowledged the fact you can currently play with people from platforms other than your own in Destiny 2 - all a little earlier than planned. 
Reports of Destiny 2 crossplay being possible emerged last night, and were picked up by Destiny community manager Cozmo. 
Describing it as an unintended &quot;sneak peek&quot;, Bungie said that crossplay was officially still in development, and would be disabled again in the coming days.

                    <span>Apex Legends&#x27; Legacy update has now been live for over a week - after a somewhat wobbly start - and Respawn has already rolled out some balance changes for two weapons. The Spitfire and newly-added Bocek Bow, both considered overpowered by the player community, have been adjusted to make them a little less lethal. 
As explained on the Legacy patch notes page, the Spitfire&#x27;s bullet damage has been reduced from 19 to 18, while gold and purple magazines will now hold 50 bullets instead of 55. The Bocek seems t…</span>

                    <span>EA has discussed how Battlefield 6 will benefit from its development focus having been on current-gen consoles - PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S - even though it will also launch on last-gen hardware - PS4 and Xbox One.
The fact Battlefield 6 will not be exclusive to current-gen consoles seems somewhat obvious, in the grand scheme of things - with scalpers and low stock still prevalent and a huge, active install base for PS4 and Xbox One. But EA only made it official for the first time last night, in an e…</span>

Zombies Ate My Neighbors, which originally launched on SNES and Sega Mega Drive back in 1993, follows the adventures of Zeke and Julie (who can be played solo or co-operatively) as they attempt to save their neighbours from a host of B-movie monsters - zombies, werewolves, vampires, giant ants, aliens, and so on - on a journey that stretches from suburb…</span>

                    <span>HTC has unveiled the latest addition to its PC VR headset line-up in the form of the Vive Pro 2, which arrives on 4th June with pre-orders open now.
As its name implies, HTC&#x27;s Vive Pro 2 is the direct successor to the high-end PC VR headset it released in 2018. It&#x27;ll up the ante with a 5K resolution display (2448x2448 pixels per eye), a 120-degree field of view, and a 120Hz panel. By way of contrast, the original Vive Pro featured a 2880x1600 resolution, a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate.

EA has not been a major part of E3 for years, instead opting to hold its own EA Play events elsewhere. E3 is traditionally held at the Los Angeles Convention Centre, while in recent years EA has housed its own show at the same time a few miles away up in Hollywood.

                    <span>Have you ever felt like going on a big cruise ship around the mythical world of Valheim? Thanks to the power of modding, now you can, so get ready for some very large vessels.
ValheimRAFT is a mod by Sarcen that allows players to construct their own ships rather than simply use the pre-made ones available in vanilla Valheim. (If the name didn&#x27;t give it away, it&#x27;s inspired by the game Raft, a survival game in which you construct a boat from bits of debris.) I had a quick tinker with it and made a basic ghost…</span>

The name first cropped up last week, when Ubisoft announced Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division: Heartland, a new free-to-play spin-off due later this year or early next.
When asked whether this label meant anything more than fancy new branding, a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer today that, &quot;Moving forward &#x27;The Ubisoft Original&#x27; mention is attached to all of Ubisoft&#x27;s games created in-h…</span>

                    <span>The constrained supply of the PlayStation 5 will continue into 2022, Sony has warned.
The company&#x27;s CFO, Hiroki Totoki, said Sony will struggle to meet demand even with a supply boost, Bloomberg reported (paywall).
As most know, the PS5 is incredibly hard to buy at the moment, with stock snapped up as soon as it goes on sale. The console has also been the focus of scalpers, who sell on for an inflated price. Retailers have struggled to prevent new consoles from getting into the hands of scalper groups, some…</span>

                    <span>The 1980s action movie heroes are coming en masse to Warzone. After this week&#x27;s tease that Rambo will be added to the battle royale, Activision has indicated Die Hard&#x27;s John McClane is on his way, too.
Activision even created a website for a fictional air conditioning repair company called Nakatomi Duct Cleaning, offering its services in Verdansk.
The website says &quot;A NAKATOMI CORP DIVISION MASTERING A/C DUCT CLEANING SINCE 1988&quot;, but the current Warzone map is set in 1984. Nah... I&#x27;m applying too much logic…</span>

                    <span>This week, if you pottered along to the Mendip Hill near Cheddar, Somerset, you&#x27;d probably have caught a glimpse of something a bit off: a huge chalk artwork of a lycan.
Local press reported the strange image on Monday, 3rd May after it popped up overnight - and seemingly had no idea what it was about or who made it.
Its true nature was revealed when Resident Evil Village came out on Friday - it was a Capcom PR stunt. And a pretty cool one, I&#x27;ll admit.

                    <span>A modder has released their final Nier: Automata HD texture pack after four years of development.
GPUnity&#x27;s texture pack mod began life soon after Nier: Automata launched on PC in March 2017. They&#x27;ve continued to work on the mod since then, and now, four years later, released the final version.
Nier: Automata&#x27;s PC version is infamous for a raft of technical issues that were fixed by modders, including a constant stutter tick due to the game running at around 59 frames per second (this is something explored …</span>

                    <span>This week, Sega announced Lost Judgment for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One - but there was no word of a PC version.
It seemed an odd omission - Tojo Dojo noticed the Yakuza spin-off sequel was briefly listed as coming to PC on the official countdown website that was home to the Lost Judgment announcement. Even after mention of PC was removed from the website, fans spotted mention of the Steam logo in the Lost Judgment website source code.
Unfortunately, it appears Lost Judgm…</span>

                    <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&#x27;s re-release on Nintendo Switch was delayed at the last minute.
The re-release of the much-loved 20 year-old action RPG went ahead as planned yesterday on Xbox One, where it costs a pricey £29.99, and PlayStation 4, where for some reason it costs a fiver cheaper at £24.99.
But even though the official Black Isle Studios Twitter page said yesterday that the Switch version would arrive in a couple of hours, the game failed to materialise on the Nintendo eShop.

Respawn&#x27;s wall-hopping assault course tasks players with completing one lap as quickly as possible - and nearly five years after Titanfall 2 came out, speedrunners are breaking world records again.
In October 2019, speedrunner Cash Mayo set an incredible time of 11.7 seconds, shaving a fraction off Mayo&#x27;s previous world record of 11.9 seconds:

&quot;The Yakuza series has been transformed into a turn-based RPG.

It saw 101,726 peak concurrents on launch day, 7th May.
That makes Capcom&#x27;s latest comfortably the biggest PC launch for any Resident Evil game. According to SteamCharts, Resident Evil 7 managed an all-time peak of 18,211 concurrents, Resident Evil 6 peaked with 11,836, and the most recent release, the Resident Evil 3 remake, hit 32,635. Only the Resident Evil 2 remake, which saw a concurrents peak of 74,024, comes close.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone developer Raven has said it is close to a &quot;balance homeostasis&quot;, where most weapon options are &quot;at the very least viable&quot; - leaving it to focus on raising the skill ceiling of the game.
The developer shared its balance change philosophy as part of the patch notes for a Warzone update that went live this week.
Raven spoke openly about the difficulty it faces making sweeping changes to the Warzone meta, as popular guns are inevitably affected.

On Wednesday, Housemarque was forced to pull Returnal&#x27;s 1.3.3 patch after players began reporting it was corrupting save games. The developer later released version 1.3.4, which rolled back to Returnal&#x27;s most recent stable build - a move that enabled some affected players to resume their pro…</span>

                    <span>This is an impressive hack:
Security researchers Ralf-Philipp Weinmann of Kunnamon, Inc. and Benedikt Schmotzle of Comsecuris GmbH have found remote zero-click security vulnerabilities in an open-source software component (ConnMan) used in Tesla automobiles that allowed them to compromise parked cars and control their infotainment systems over WiFi. It would be possible for an attacker to unlock the doors and trunk, change seat positions, both steering and acceleration modes — in short, pretty much wh…</span>

                    <span>The person behind the Bitcoin Fog was identified and arrested. Bitcoin Fog was an anonymization service: for a fee, it mixed a bunch of people’s bitcoins up so that it was hard to figure out where any individual coins came from. It ran for ten years.
Identifying the person behind Bitcoin Fog serves as an illustrative example of how hard it is to be anonymous online in the face of a competent police investigation:
Most remarkable, however, is the IRS’s account of tracking down Sterlingov using th…</span>

                    <span>Apple just patched a MacOS vulnerability that bypassed malware checks.
The flaw is akin to a front entrance that’s barred and bolted effectively, but with a cat door at the bottom that you can easily toss a bomb through. Apple mistakenly assumed that applications will always have certain specific attributes. Owens discovered that if he made an application that was really just a script—code that tells another program what do rather than doing it itself—and didn’t include a standard application me…</span>

                    <span>In this entertaining story of French serial criminal Rédoine Faïd and his jailbreaking ways, there’s this bit about cell phone surveillance:
After Faïd’s helicopter breakout, 3,000 police officers took part in the manhunt. According to the 2019 documentary La Traque de Rédoine Faïd, detective units scoured records of cell phones used during his escape, isolating a handful of numbers active at the time that went silent shortly thereafter.</span>
