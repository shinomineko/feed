                              <span>Blizzard has issued a World of Warcraft roadmap spanning an entire year.


In a move welcomed by fans of the 18-year-old massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Blizzard told players what to expect throughout 2023 and the road ahead for recently-released expansion Dragonflight.


Six content updates are set to go live throughout 2023, Blizzard said in a blog post, the first of which is right around the corner and adds the recently-announced Trading Post, new transmog options for grey and white gear, and additional world content.

That&#x27;s according to series creator and showrunner Lauren Hissrich. Talking to EW, Hissrich reflected on Cavill&#x27;s time on the show, saying the team wanted to &quot;honour that appropriately&quot;.


According to Hissrich, season three of The Witcher has taken inspiration from author Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s fourth book, Time of Contempt.

So how did they conduct themselves outside of the gaming bubble? With abuse and unintelligence of course. 


According to the CMA, it received approximately 2600 emails, around 500 of which &quot;contained abusive content (with no other substantive content), or were blank, unintelligible, stated to be from non-UK consumers, or not in English&quot;.

While the game will remain playable and rankings will continue without the use of prize pass levels, no new characters or maps will be released, effectively ending support following the conclusion of Season 5.


Meanwhile, sales of mythril, Chocobo GP&#x27;s premium currency, have been discontinued. The in-game mythril shop will disappear on 6th January. All purchased mythril becomes &quot;invalid&quot; then, too. Square Enix said it will not issue refunds for purchased mythril.

Like EternalBlue, CVE-2022-37958, as the latest vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to execute malicious code with no authentication required. Also, like EternalBlue, it’s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required...</span>

Kubernetes v1.26 introduced generally available (GA) support for kubelet credential
provider plugins,
offering an extensible plugin framework to dynamically fetch credentials
for any container image registry.
Background
Kubernetes supports the ability to dynamically fetch credentials for a container registry service.
Prior to Kubernetes v1.20, this capability was compiled into the kubelet and only available for
Amazon Elastic Container Registry, Azure Container Registry, and Google Cloud Container Registry.

                              <span>Continuing on with its season of giving, Epic Games Store is offering users the chance to get their hands on Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey for free right now. 


This diorama puzzler from developer Light Brick Studio is yours to claim until tomorrow (22nd December) at 4pm. After that, Epic will unveil its next mystery giveaway.


I have personally never played Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey, although it sounds right up my street. Our own Christian Donlan was quite enamoured with Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey&#x27;s breezy, tactile charms when he played through it, calling it &quot;the perfect holiday treat&quot; in his write up.

                              <span>Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 developer Raven Software has announced that the fan-favourite Loadout Drop has returned. 


Previously a legacy feature of the original Warzone, a Loadout Drop let players and their squad use custom-made loadouts rather than the weapons scavenged in the battle royale. 


While Loadout Drops would randomly spawn in the game world, buying a Loadout Drop grenade from a Buy Station would let you request a drop on demand.

                              <span>More snippets of information about Star Wars Jedi Survivor are steadily being released, with the most recent of these shedding more light on combat, traversal, and a new face for the series. 


Speaking to Game Informer, director Stig Asmussen stated players will discover &quot;five fully realised stances in the game&quot; for protagonist Cal Kestis, including a dedicated dual blade option and Kylo Ren-esque crossguard-style lightsaber (both of which were glimpsed in the most recent gameplay trailer, which you can see below).


As you may already have assumed, Asmussen said it will be &quot;advantageous to use certain types of stances against certain types of enemies&quot;. This, the director says, will require the player to &quot;break down the enemies and figure out what the best weapon of choice is&quot;.

The two faced each other while playing for their respective national teams in the World Cup final on Sunday, with the result securing Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time. But it also brought on a headache for the young Mbappe who scored a hat-trick in the match. 


Now the two will fly back to Paris to play together once again, and some have wondered what the changing room talk might be like.

                              <span>Atari is in a spot of bother, and has signalled it may need extra cash to continue.

Reporting its half year results to 30th September 2022, the Paris-based company admitted any delays in the development of its four activities (gaming, hardware, licensing and blockchain), or underperformance in its initiatives may cause it to make less money than expected, and in turn spark &quot;a liquidity shortfall and additional financing requirements&quot;.


There&#x27;s an &quot;uncertain macro-environment&quot; for video games and blockchain, the latter of which Atari has gone in heavily on, and so the company reckons actually implementing its new strategy &quot;may require additional funding resources&quot;.

The trailer in question (which I have seen) introduced an NPC known as Shaun. It was a playful set up that showed Shaun being interviewed about his work on Goat Simulator 3. 


Here he boasted about his impressive rag-dolling skills (he went to the &quot;most prestigious rag-dolling school in the world&quot;, you see), and reflected that sometimes he just sits on a bench and ponders the world at large. All in all, some fairly inoffensive stuff.

The now-deleted Tweets included a video of Ferdinand discussing the upcoming Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid, with the accompanying next: &quot;Here&#x27;s who I think will be taking home the [trophy emoji] … Class Day down at #PlayStationHouse ahead of the #UCLFinalv … @PlayStation #PlayStationPartner.&quot;


A second Tweet included a series of images showing Ferdinand take part in various activities at PlayStation House, which appears to be a popup social event for influencers ahead of the Champions League final.

                              <span>A group of 10 gamers in the US have teamed up to file a federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft over its proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


As spotted by Bloomberg Law, the lawsuit argues that the acquisition will give Microsoft enough influence over multiple levels of the gaming industry &quot;to foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition&quot;.


&quot;Microsoft already controls one of the industry’s most popular and largest video game ecosystems,&quot; the suit alleges.

In a hand-on preview, The Verge noticed that battery life was noticeably worse than the base DualSense controller, and this was later confirmed to the publication in a statement. 


&quot;The DualSense Edge wireless controller&#x27;s operating time is moderately shorter than the original DualSense wireless controller,&quot; a Sony spokesperson said. &quot;We wanted to strike a good balance between wireless operating time and delivering robust, high-performance features.&quot;

This version of the game will include a new Arenas mode, which will also arrive as a free update for PC via the Epic Games Store and on PlayStation at the same time.


Details of what this new offering will include are thin on the ground at the moment - a trailer for the update promises nine maps which will unlock new modifiers and alternate moves, additional cheats and fresh outfits. It sounds like they&#x27;ll be worth playing!

At least you can have fun with it, and that&#x27;s exactly what YouTuber and animator King Bob Gaming did, having recreated the entire trailer with Nintendo 64 graphics.

                              <span>The Witcher 3&#x27;s next-gen update on PC has received a hotfix to address a number of the issues that accompanied the launch. 


According to the patch notes, the hotfix should &quot;improve overall stability and performance of the game, and fix GOG &amp; Steam overlays.&quot; 


Stability and performance improvements is of course the catch-all phrase used by developers to group a large number of small fixes, but we do know from reports of PC users that problems included framerate drops and slow texture loading.

                              <span>Paw-don me, I didn&#x27;t mean to inter-ruff your day, but I have some news to share with you: Pupperazzi, and all the dogs that come with it, will be bounding onto the Nintendo Switch early next year. 


Sundae Month and publisher Kitfox Games announced this news as part of Nintendo&#x27;s House of Indies: Holiday Event yesterday, promising Switch owners that soon they will be able to use their photography skills to snap all the best shots of shibas, terriers, labs, pugs, and more. &quot;You want &#x27;em, WE GOT EM!&quot; the Pupperazzi team proclaimed.


But it is not just taking pictures. Along with getting nice photos of your canine compatriots, you will also be able to play fetch with them, dress them up in a variety of outfits, have a dance party (or should that be paw-ty) with them and &quot;terrorise them with vacuum cleaners&quot; (but would you really want to do that?). You can even see them in action at the skatepark - in fact, Pupperazzi&#x27;s entire world is populated with dogs, dogs and yet more dogs. You can see what I mean in the trailer below.

                              <span>Despite mixed reviews and launch day technical issues, foul-mouthed shooter High on Life has screamed to the top of Xbox Game Pass&#x27; most played list.


Squanch Games and Justin Roiland&#x27;s effort is now the most popular game in Microsoft&#x27;s subscription - in both its PC and console catalogues. 


On Xbox consoles, more people are playing High on Life through Game Pass than other popular titles such as Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, FIFA 22 and Rainbow Six Siege. Indeed, it is currently being played by more people than any first-party Microsoft release, including Minecraft, Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite and Sea of Thieves.

                              <span>A major new study from UK consumer group Which? has found evidence that the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s infamous Joy-Con drift is likely caused by a mechanical fault, pointing to fundamental design flaws.


The research found that the Joy-Con&#x27;s plastic circuit boards showed noticeable wear on the joystick slider contact points, despite only being used for months. It is this wear that ultimately results in drifting. 


In addition, dust and other contaminants were found in the Switch&#x27;s internal components, despite attempts by Nintendo at dustproofing said areas.

Mandiant uncovered a socially engineered supply chain operation focused on Ukrainian government entities that leveraged trojanized ISO files masquerading as legitimate Windows 10 Operating System installers. The trojanized ISOs were hosted on Ukrainian- and Russian-language torrent file sharing sites. Upon installation of the compromised software, the malware gathers information on the compromised system and exfiltrates it. At a subset of victims, additional tools are deployed to enable further intelligence gathering. In some instances, we discovered additional payloads that were likely deployed following initial reconnaissance including the STOWAWAY, BEACON, and SPAREPART backdoors...</span>

In Kubernetes 1.26, the 1st alpha release of validating admission policies is
available!
Validating admission policies use the Common Expression
Language (CEL) to offer a declarative,
in-process alternative to validating admission
webhooks.
CEL was first introduced to Kubernetes for the Validation rules for
CustomResourceDefinitions.
This enhancement expands the use of CEL in Kubernetes to support a far wider
range of admission use cases.
Admission webhooks can be burdensome to develop and operate. Webhook developers
must implement and maintain a webhook binary to handle admission requests. Also,
admission webhooks are complex to operate. Each webhook must be deployed,
monitored and have a well defined upgrade and rollback plan. To make matte…</span>

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission has hit Fortnite maker Epic Games with a record-breaking penalty of $520m (£427m) over allegations it previously employed &quot;lax privacy practices&quot; for voice and text chat, and used design tricks to &quot;dupe millions of players&quot; into unintentional purchases. 


The eye-opening judgment includes the largest-ever settlement obtained by the FTC regarding the US Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act, as Fortnite allowed in-game chat and user data collection by default. 


Fortnite holds a &quot;Teen&quot; rating by the US ratings board ESRB, but the FTC has argued Epic Games knew many of its users were likely under 13 years of age and had not obtained their parents&#x27; consent.

                              <span>EA has used its FIFA series to correctly predict the winner of the World Cup for fourth consecutive time. 


The entire tournament was simulated inside FIFA 23, which outputted Argentina as the ultimate winners, with Lionel Messi winning the Golden Boot and Emi Martínez winning the Golden Glove awards. The predictions were published November 8th, long before the tournament had started. 


The game&#x27;s ability to predict the winner for the fourth time in a row is a testament to the accuracy of FIFA&#x27;s official rankings, but of course the uncertainty of the real world means that not everything was predicted correctly.

Square Enix states each of these remasters, which can be bought as a one stop bundle with all six games or individually, will offer improved gameplay, a &quot;modernised UI&quot; and other accoutrements such as &quot;a bestiary, illustration gallery and music player&quot;.

But it also brought with a whole host of bugs and glitches.

EA&#x27;s mega-successful football series is a frequent winner of the Christmas number one crown, and last week likely saw a further boost in sales due to the attention surrounding the controversial World Cup in Qatar.


FIFA games have now taken the Christmas top spot 10 times since sales records began back in 1984, making it the most popular Christmas number one franchise (versus Call of Duty&#x27;s nine Christmas chart toppers).

“Seeing the drone in the field of view, make eye contact with it,” the video instructs. Soldiers should then raise their arms and signal they’re ready to follow.
After that the drone will move up and down a few meters, before heading off at walking pace in the direction of the nearest representatives of Ukraine’s army, it says.
The video also warns that the drone’s battery may run low, in which case it will head back to base and the soldiers should stay put and await a fresh one...</span>

The Device Plugin framework was introduced in the Kubernetes v1.8 release as a vendor
independent framework to enable discovery, advertisement and allocation of external
devices without modifying core Kubernetes. The feature graduated to Beta in v1.10.
With the recent release of Kubernetes v1.26, Device Manager is now generally
available (GA).
Within the kubelet, the Device Manager facilitates communication with device plugins
using gRPC through Unix sockets. Device Manager and Device plugins both act as gRPC
servers and clients by serving and connecting to the exposed gRPC services respectively.
Device plugins serve a gRPC service that kubelet connects to for device discovery,
advertisement (as extended resources) and allocation. Device Manager connects to

                              <span>It looks like Microsoft is considering introducing cheaper, ad-supported tiers of its Xbox Game Pass.

That&#x27;s according to a survey Microsoft recently circulated to players, inviting views about the current Xbox Game Pass subscription and querying if we&#x27;d be willing to accept adverts if the subscription payment was lower.

An unsourced screenshot, written in Spanish and shared on ResetEra (via VGC), alleges that Microsoft is surveying players and exploring a tier-like system - similar to that of Ubisoft+ and Sony&#x27;s PS Plus - by inviting them to &quot;consider hypothetical subscriptions&quot;.

The episodic videos take you through collaboration with the team at Techland to rehearsals with the London Contemporary Orchestra to &quot;create an enthralling soundtrack&quot;.

Ubisoft has been pretty quiet about the game so far, and even the name remains under wraps for now. But that hasn&#x27;t stopped the studio from putting out a public call to players, inviting them to join the playtest team.

&quot;Be part of something great,&quot; the studio teases on its sign-up page. &quot;Nothing beats the feeling of being part of the creation of a completely new game.

Running from now until 19th December, you&#x27;ll be able to kick off your own Viking adventure on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and the Ubisoft Store. 

If you&#x27;ve yet to meet Eivor, you&#x27;ll get &quot;full main game content&quot; - so, the base game, without any subsequent DLC - and if you like it enough to stick around, your progression will carry over if you decide to purchase the game.

                              <span>Meta&#x27;s VR consulting CTO, John Carmack, is leaving the company after &quot;a decade in VR&quot;, accusing the firm of &quot;self-sabotage&quot;.

In an internal note seen by Business Insider, Carmack criticised the company&#x27;s &quot;efficiency&quot;, adding that despite Quest 2 being &quot;almost exactly what [he] wanted to see&quot; with its &quot;mobile hardware, inside out tracking, optional PC streaming, 4K(ish) software&quot;, he was &quot;offended&quot; at seeing a &quot;5 per cent GPU utilisation number in production&quot;.

&quot;We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort,&quot; Carmack - who co-created the Doom and Quake franchises - said in the leaked memo. &quot;There is no way to sugarcoat this; I think our organisation is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy.

                              <span>Playtest footage reportedly taken from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Jade has leaked online.

Allegedly posted to an Assassin&#x27;s Creed Facebook page and then, in turn, shared with Assassin&#x27;s Creed and Gaming Leaks and Rumours on Reddit, the footage - which runs for 2.40 mins - was seemingly captured on an Apple mobile device and depicts a combat-heavy sequence, which includes cut-scenes and combat tutorials. You can watch it here. 

Whilst it&#x27;s not the first we&#x27;ve seen of Jade - Ubisoft dropped a polished teaser earlier this year - it is the first time we&#x27;ve seen raw footage like this (thanks, TheGamer). As always, you can&#x27;t necessarily expect the final product to look and/or play this way - this is likely a very, very early version of the game - and, as always, if you&#x27;re interested, you should probably check it out sooner rather than later: these things have a habit of disappearing within a day or two.

                              <span>Double Fine boss Tim Schafer has revealed he avoids &quot;a grab bag of stereotypes&quot; to make his games more inclusive and avoid &quot;hurting people&quot;.

In an interview with NME, Schafer revealed that when he started making games back in the &#x27;80s, there was &quot;a lot less sensitivity&quot; around, but between developing 2005&#x27;s Psychonauts and its 2021 sequel, he&#x27;d &quot;learned a lot&quot; and was &quot;thinking about how [his] art will be interpreted by the viewer&quot;.

&quot;I thought I&#x27;d learned a lot, and then we tested a game, and people pointed out a word and asked if we knew what this word means to certain people,&quot; the Schafer said. &quot;I had no idea – and people will criticise that and say &#x27;woke culture, PC police&#x27; and stuff – but for any art, I&#x27;m thinking about how my art will be interpreted by the viewer.

                              <span>Five long-serving senior team members at Need for Speed developer Criterion have departed the studio following the launch of Need for Speed Unbound last month.


As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion&#x27;s vice president and general manager Matt Webster has left the studio after 23 years, as has head of studio development and 17-year Criterion veteran Alan McDairmant.


They&#x27;re joined by senior technical director Andrei Shires, who has been with the company for 16 years, as well as executive producer Pete Lake, who first joined Criterion in 1996. Head of content Steve Uphill also leaves following his most recent 10-year stint at Criterion. All are said to have left the developer to &quot;explore new opportunities outside of EA&quot;.

                              <span>Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla Games has confirmed a new co-op-focused online Horizon project is currently in the works at the studio.


Reports of a co-op component for the Horizon series first emerged in 2020, when VGC claimed the studio had initially been looking to implement the feature as part of 2017&#x27;s Horizon Zero Dawn before ditching it to focus on other areas. Co-op was then said to have been revived for Horizon Forbidden West, potentially as a separate mode, but again didn&#x27;t make the final cut.


As confirmed by Guerilla&#x27;s recruitment-focused Twitter feed, however, the studio&#x27;s co-op dreams are still very much alive, with the company currently hiring for an internally developed &quot;separate online project&quot; in the Horizon universe. This will feature a &quot;new cast of characters and a unique stylised look&quot;, and allow friends to &quot;explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together&quot;.

                              <span>High On Life creator Justin Roiland has revealed the game features AI-generated art and voice acting.
The topic of AI generation has increasingly become a hot discussion, with arguments arising over its use and the implications it has ethically, artistically, and technologically. 
In an interview with Sky News, Roiland talked about the use of AI in the development of High On Life.

                              <span>Elden Ring has absolutely dominated the news this year, so much so I&#x27;ve ended up writing 100 news pieces on it alone.


Well, 99 actually. So writing one more in celebration of the best Elden Ring news stories of the year seemed like a fitting way to hit that hundred.


And so below is my ranked list of top 20 favourites. Before that, a big thanks to the rest of the team too for their superb coverage in news, guides, videos, and Aoife&#x27;s Essential review.

Available now on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, the update weighs in at around 11-13GB and also adds &quot;combat improvements... localisation optimisations and general quality of life changes&quot;. 


A specific fix has been made for an issue on PS4, where the game&#x27;s Trophies were not syncing. This has now been addressed.

                              <span>Valve is unlikely to soup up the graphical prowess of its Steam Deck in time for the PC gaming handheld&#x27;s second generation, the company has indicated. 


Instead, the next version of Steam Deck is far more likely to see hardware improvements centered around its screen and battery capacity. 


Speaking to The Verge, Steam Deck engineers suggested Valve was keen to stick with one singal performance point for the handheld for the time being - it&#x27;s simple to understand Steam Deck verified status - to avoid muddying the waters.

But another Easter egg discovered by players isn&#x27;t as easy to solve as those.

Some had speculated (hoped?) Cavill would reprise his much-loved role as Geralt after Warner Bros. ditched him as Superman.


In October, Netflix announced The Witcher Season 4 and Cavill&#x27;s exit from the show.

The match-three game was the Mega Drive&#x27;s answer to Tetris, with coloured gems falling from the top of the screen to iconic music. I played the hell out of this as part of the Mega Games One compilation. 


The other games joining are Golden Axe 2, Alien Storm, and Virtua Fighter 2. See them in action in the trailer below.

                              <span>Spare a thought for poor old Henry Cavill: once wearer of the gangly locks as Geralt of Rivia, once bearer of the bulgy bits as Superman, now no longer either. But on the bright side, his lovely dog&#x27;s now in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, courtesy of its new-gen update.


Henry Cavill&#x27;s dog, an American Akita named Kal, is a bit of a star in his own right, frequently snapped alongside the actor and apparently a bit of a fixture on-set of Cavill&#x27;s projects. During filming of The Witcher, for instance, Kal was said to have been on location the &quot;entire time&quot;. 


And now Kal has been immortalised in digital form, appearing at the Devil&#x27;s Pit for players that get the &quot;good&quot; ending in The Witcher 3&#x27;s new quest In The Eternal Fire&#x27;s Shadow, introduced as part of CD Projekt&#x27;s long-in-the-works new-gen update.

                              <span>Six years after announcing his departure from Blizzard Entertainment, and his retirement from the games industry at large, long-serving Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen is returning to the company as creative advisor on the Warcraft franchise.


Metzen&#x27;s retirement from Blizzard in 2016 came as a shock to many a fan. He&#x27;d been with the company for 23 years at that point, serving as head writer and lore guru (or, more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) and had become one of its most recognisable faces across countless BlizzCons.


&quot;The reason I use the word &#x27;retire&#x27;&quot;, Metzen explained in a statement at the time of his departure, &quot;is because I&#x27;m not going to some other company or starting up new projects or anything remotely like that. It&#x27;s been a long, amazing stretch of years. Now it&#x27;s time to slow it down. Rest. Lay around on the couch and get fat.&quot;

                              <span>Hideo Kojima&#x27;s idiosyncratic post-apocalyptic courier adventure Death Stranding is the latest in an increasingly long line of video games to get the movie treatment, courtesy of a newly announced collaboration between Kojima Productions and Barbarian executive producer Alex Lebovici&#x27;s Hammerstone Studios.


Death Stranding, for those unfamiliar, stars The Walking Dead&#x27;s Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier trying to make ends meet in an aggressively wet corner of rural Wales. One day, his clothes unexpectedly fall off, a baby turns into goo, ...fish?! Then, walking!!!!


Okay, so that&#x27;s not exactly how it goes (although it&#x27;s not not, either) but it&#x27;s fair to say Death Stranding&#x27;s atmospheric tale of a post-apocalyptic United States - which, yes, does look at awful lot like Wales - is not short of wonderfully outlandish ideas. There are eerily invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, a mysterious plane of existence known as the Beach, and much, much more.

                              <span>Insomniac has confirmed Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, the eagerly awaited sequel to 2018&#x27;s acclaimed open-world swing-em-up - will arrive on PS5 next &quot;fall&quot;.


That&#x27;s not, admittedly, anywhere close to being an actual launch date, but at least fans can now update their diaries and keep their anticipation in check. And the not particularly specific announcement may have something to do with the fact the &quot;fall 2023&quot; release was leaked earlier this week after a writer on the project added the date (since removed) to their online CV.


Official confirmation, however, has now arrived courtesy of a new post to the PlayStation Blog. &quot;What a year it&#x27;s been for PlayStation Studios,&quot; Spider-Man 2 creative director Bryan Intihar wrote as part of the news, &quot;here at Insomniac Games we’ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers. Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022...and here’s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.”

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in the mood for some entertainment that&#x27;s both fun and free, you might like to point your browser in the direction of No Man&#x27;s Sky studio Hello Games, which has just made the two mobile instalments of its very excellent arcade stunt racer series Joe Danger playable on the web for the grand total of zero pee.


More specifically, those with a hankering for some stuntery and a browser within arms reach can test their racing mettle in Joe Danger Touch and its follow-up Joe Danger Infinity, which were initially released on iOS in 2013 and 2014.


Both games, you might recall, unceremoniously vanished from the App Store in 2017, following Apple&#x27;s decision to end support for 32-bit apps with iOS11. But in a lovely moment at the start of this year, they each received a surprise re-release. &quot;It&#x27;s always been a secret shame of ours that the success of No Man&#x27;s Sky left Joe Danger unloved,&quot; Hello Games&#x27; Sean Murray explained at the time. &quot;For the last two years we&#x27;ve had a hobby project of bringing Joe Danger back to life. Slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of Unity changes.&quot;

                              <span>Earlier this year, it was announced that the next game in the Tomb Raider series was in development. 


While details about this upcoming release are still thin on the ground, with even its name still remaining a mystery, today Amazon Games announced it will be working alongside developer Crystal Dynamics on the project. 


Amazon will provide its &quot;full support&quot; to the team at Crystal Dynamics to bring this next Tomb Raider game to life, the company said today. On the game&#x27;s release, Amazon Games will also act as its publisher.

                              <span>There may be no more new characters for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (and series creator Masahiro Sakurai can finally take a bit of a break), but that doesn&#x27;t mean the series is quite finished yet.

For fans looking to complete their amiibo collection, there&#x27;s now an official release date for Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s Sephiroth and Tekken&#x27;s Kazuya Mishima.
Minecraft&#x27;s Steve and Alex were the most recent amiibo to be released, after they were delayed to September earlier this year.

                              <span>A quick PSA for those keen to try out some of Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer offerings but who don&#x27;t fancy splashing their cash on the full game: its free access period begins today.


This free access will run until 19th December, and offers three maps and four modes to play through.


The maps in question are Shipment (a new arrival to the game - more on that in a second), Farm 18 (which is a Shoothouse inspired number) and El Asilo. Meanwhile, the four modes are Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed. These can be played in first and third-person.

                              <span>Starfield&#x27;s lead quest designer Will Shen has divulged more about the upcoming game&#x27;s faction quests and the players&#x27; companion side-kicks. 


In a new video, Shen revealed Starfield&#x27;s faction quests will be more similar to those from Bethesda&#x27;s Skyrim, in the sense that players will be able to experience each faction independently. This will not be a Fallout 4 situation, which saw players being locked out of factions after joining another (something that was a bone of contention among some members of the community).


&quot;One of the early things we decided on was making sure that the main quest actually kind of gives you a little bit of a tour of the settled systems and all of the major players there so that we can give you a taste of what they&#x27;re going to be up to,&quot; Shen explained.

Roach is Geralt&#x27;s trusty steed but until now she&#x27;s only been rideable, despite the strong bond players form with her over the hours and hours of playtime. 


Now, thanks to the recent upgrade patch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, Roach can be given the love and affection she deserves.

                              <span>Security researchers found a software bug in the KmsdBot cryptomining botnet:
With no error-checking built in, sending KmsdBot a malformed command­—like its controllers did one day while Akamai was watching­—created a panic crash with an “index out of range” error. Because there’s no persistence, the bot stays down, and malicious agents would need to reinfect a machine and rebuild the bot’s functions. It is, as Akamai notes, “a nice story” and “a strong example of the fickle nature of technology.”

                              <span>Last week, I hosted a two-day workshop on reimagining democracy.
The idea was to bring together people from a variety of disciplines who are all thinking about different aspects of democracy, less from a “what we need to do today” perspective and more from a blue-sky future perspective. My remit to the participants was this:
The idea is to start from scratch, to pretend we’re forming a new country and don’t have any precedent to deal with. And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent. The twenty-first century is a very different place technically, scientifically, and philosophically. What could democracy look like if it were reinvented today? Would it even be democracy­—what comes after democracy?...</span>

Dynamic resource allocation is a new API for requesting resources. It is a
generalization of the persistent volumes API for generic resources, making it possible to:
access the same resource instance in different pods and containers,
attach arbitrary constraints to a resource request to get the exact resource
you are looking for,
initialize a resource according to parameters provided by the user.
Third-party resource drivers are responsible for interpreting these parameters
as well as tracking and allocating resources as requests come in.
Dynamic resource allocation is an alpha feature and only enabled when the
DynamicResourceAllocation feature
gate and the
resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group are enabled. For details, see the
--feature-gat…</span>

As was the case for previous Mega Man Legacy Collections, Capcom&#x27;s Battle Network compilation - which gathers together 10 games in the real-time tactical RPG spin-off series - will be split across two volumes for its digital release. 


Volume 1 features Mega Man Battle Network, Mega Man Battle Network 2, Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue, and Mega Man Battle Network 3 White - all of which originally launched for Nintendo GBA between 2001 and 2003.

                              <span>Following reports earlier this year that Amazon was eyeing up a live-action TV adaptation of Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War series, the project is now officially go for Prime Video.


According to The Hollywood Reporter, the show has been in development since March and will, notably, focus on Kratos&#x27; dad years in Midgard as per 2018&#x27;s God of War reboot, rather than the ultra-violent Greek-mythology-inspired adventures of Kratos&#x27; earlier games.


Here&#x27;s how the show&#x27;s official description teases its plot: &quot;When his beloved wife dies, Kratos sets off on a dangerous journey with his estranged son to spread her ashes from the highest peak - his wife&#x27;s final wish. Kratos soon realises the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new gods and monsters for the fate of the world.&quot;

                              <span>The paladin class is coming to the early access version of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. It&#x27;s the headline addition in Patch 9 which, I&#x27;m afraid, sounds like it will be the last major content update to the early access build before the game&#x27;s full release in August 2023.
Larian leader Swen Vinke said this during a patch pre-briefing a week ago, telling press - myself included - they&#x27;d now like to concentrate on finishing the game, which is fair enough.
No release date for Patch 9 has been communicated.

In a post announcing the news, Epic described the services and servers it&#x27;s pulling as &quot;out-of-date&quot;, and said it was making the move as it transitions to exclusively support its Epic Online Services &quot;with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features&quot;.

Announced as part of Private Division&#x27;s fifth anniversary celebrations, the new project is said to be in &quot;early development&quot; for unnamed platforms. Further details are scant to the point of non-existent, but Bloober has confirmed we won&#x27;t be seeing the fruits of its efforts for quite some time, with a launch not expected before 2025.


In a statement accompany today&#x27;s announcement, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno referred to the unnamed project only as an &quot;exciting new survival horror game&quot;, saying it &quot;will help us become a leader in the horror industry at large&quot;.

Throughout the day, users have been taking to social media and to Steam&#x27;s review section to make their feelings clear about the game&#x27;s performance on their PC setups. Overall, the suggestion is the game is punishing on CPUs - even high-end ones - if you have ray-tracing switched on.


Some users have said they&#x27;ve since used Steam&#x27;s roll-back functionality to remove the update entirely.

                              <span>Last week, we got the news that none other than Idris Elba would be part of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion. This news was, for many of us, a very welcome surprise. 


However, Hungarian digital artist Zsolt Kosa actually envisioned this collaboration much, much, earlier. Perhaps, even before developer CD Projekt Red did. 


Two years ago, Kosa shared two mocked up posters of Elba in Cyberpunk 2077 to his ArtStation page. The first of these shows Elba with ice blue cyber-eyes and an impressively collared coat (as shown in this article&#x27;s header image). The second shows him with some rather fancy looking sunglasses, and that same very fetching coat.

This the second Mushroom Kingdom theme park area to open globally, following the first&#x27;s opening at Universal Studios in Japan in 2021. 


The two will share a number of similar attractions, including an AR Mario Kart-themed ride, a Mario-themed cafe and exclusive merchandise. But the US version will lack its big Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure ride - cut, it was previously reported, due to size issues.

The expansion pack sold 1m copies in July, just a week after it released. As we&#x27;ve previously reported, by 2020 the base game sold 6m copies, so it looks like the DLC is selling extremely well to its fans.

Ed loved The Delicious Last Course when he dug into it at release, which delivered on the recipe of success nailed by the original.

The patch adds ray-traced reflections when playing using the game&#x27;s 30fps Fidelity Mode, allowing for details such as vehicles and characters to be shown on reflective surfaces such as windows and in water. 


Fly a helicopter past a skyscraper and you&#x27;ll now see your ride reflected in its glass. Zoom along Los Santos&#x27; neon-drenched waterfront in your jet ski, and you&#x27;ll be able to see its lights reflected in the waves. Neat!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve all done it before. You need a picture for an assignment or presentation, you head to Google and find the perfect image. But it&#x27;s got a huge watermark across it. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s being used for profit, or it&#x27;s going to be seen by thousands of people, so it&#x27;s probably fine.
The stakes are a little different when said assignment is, say, a £50 game from a best-selling, worldwide franchise. And unfortunately for someone at Square Enix, that assignment was Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion.
Shortly after the game&#x27;s release yesterday, the eagle-eyed writers over at Kotaku noticed a Getty Images watermark on one of the in-game paintings.

However, one PlayStation 1 game that many have dabbled with since its release on PlayStation Plus is Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue, the tie-in game for Pixar and Disney&#x27;s 1999 animation film.  

In fact, this game is actually third on Sony&#x27;s most played classic games for 2022, sitting only behind Mafia: Definitive Edition and God of War 3 Remastered. This makes it the most played PlayStation Plus PS1 game of 2022.

A long reddit thread of experiences from players writing on r/Games lists numerous experiences of frame-rate issues and long load times even on high-end PC setups - only to see them improved without the 2K Launcher active. 


Bypassing the launcher is not as simple as hitting uninstall - 2K clearly wants you to run its software as part of the game&#x27;s startup. Still, the thread has a point-by-point list of instructions for those who do want to give it a go.

Yes, you can now play games on Steam on a Tesla. Not just Cuphead and Sonic, but also Cyberpunk 2077! And Elden Ring (with a build that doesn&#x27;t make any sense)!

                              <span>Spider-Man from Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man will appear in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. 


Yep, you read that right. The Yuri Lowenthal-voiced Spidey from Insomniac&#x27;s PlayStation game series will be part of the upcoming animated multiverse movie.


Insomniac&#x27;s Spidey incarnation can be briefly seen in Across the Spider-Verse&#x27;s latest trailer - although it is unclear how much of a role the character will play in the final film.

                              <span>Most of us have probably settled in quite comfortably to Mario Kart 8 by now. After all, it has been out for almost nine years on the Wii U, while the Switch&#x27;s Deluxe edition has been around since 2017. 


However, Nintendo&#x27;s most recent Mario Kart update does not address MK8. Rather, it&#x27;s for its predecessor - the 3DS&#x27;s Mario Kart 7.


This update - or, to give it its official name, the version 1.2 update - is the first update that this game has received in a little over 10 years. Here are the full notes from Nintendo - &quot;Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Unknown Worlds&#x27; superb underwater survival adventure Subnautica has just received its first major update in two years, bringing with it new building bits, performance enhancements, accessibility features, quality of life improvements, and over 800 bug fixes.


Unknown Worlds&#x27; latest update - officially titled Living Large, or 2.0 to its friends - is described as a &quot;labour of love for the entire Subnautica team&quot;, and aims to address &quot;a tonne of tech debt and [bring] across some improved code from Below Zero.&quot;


To that end, Living Large moves Subnautica and its follow-up Below Zero onto unified versions of Unity, enabling the developer to implement quality of life features, fix bugs, and performance improvements in Subnautica that were already available in the more recent game.

                              <span>You know what really grinds my gears? Well, lots of things, but in this case, let’s talk about multi-cloud. Not my typical rant about multi-cloud not ever being a good best practice—because it’s not—but rather how companies talk about multi-cloud. HashiCorp just did a whole survey on how multi-cloud is the future, and at no point during that entire process did they define the term.

                              <span>As Ubisoft&#x27;s preferential treatment for the Epic Games Store continues to evaporate, yet another of the publisher&#x27;s titles is making its way to Steam, with the reasonably well-recieved Watch Dogs Legion now pencilled in for a 23rd January release on Valve&#x27;s platform.


This latest listings follows Ubisoft&#x27;s announcement back in November that, having skipped Steam in favour of Epic and its own Ubisoft Connect since 2019, it would soon be bringing a select number of its games to Valve&#x27;s storefront, starting with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800, and the free-to-play Roller Champions.


That initial line-up expanded by one last week with Immortals Fenyx Rising, and now Watch Dogs Legion&#x27;s official January release brings Ubisoft&#x27;s post-2019 Steam selection up to five.

                              <span>Two Point Studios has lifted the festive pudding&#x27;s lid off its free winter update for spoof school strategy game Two Point Campus.


This update will see players decking their halls with boughs of holly, thanks to a collection of new seasonal items that have been added to the game. This includes charming stockings, twinkling fairy lights, and even Santa&#x27;s very own sleigh (which comes complete with its own reindeer team).


Meanwhile, thanks to the new Christmas tree additions, you could even say you will now be able to spruce your campus up a bit. After all, these decorations are tree-mendous (ok, I&#x27;ll stop now).

                              <span>How safe do you feel in your Valheim base? Walls secure, trenches dug out, windows sealed? Even with all these precautions in place, you may still not be safe from Valheim&#x27;s new enemies. With the introduction of the Mistlands update comes a new type of raid - and this one is wreaking havoc on established player bases. Rather devastatingly, some players are losing homes that took them hundreds of hours to make. 


The new event, called &quot;they sought you out&quot;, unleashes hordes of insects on your player base - and worse still, they can fly. Seekers and seeker soldiers are capable of hopping over ditches, then mulching stone walls like they&#x27;re made of papier maché. The event can occur at any time after you&#x27;ve defeated the Plains boss Yagluth, so anyone who has completed Valheim&#x27;s biomes is vulnerable to these attacks. And sure enough, it&#x27;s taking a lot of players by surprise. 


&quot;When we got raided we got caught off-guard and lost our three-story base which took us hundreds of hours,&quot; said one Reddit user. &quot;It was protected with walls, trenches, and most upgraded gates - it didn&#x27;t slow the seekers down at all... We all rage quit after surviving the raid, but after looking around at the aftermath, we realised any amount of rebuilding wouldn&#x27;t matter because we lost seasonal item buffs for comfort level and we could not survive another raid like that.&quot;

The news was shared by Sega on its official Japanese website and Twitter account.

In comparison, total sales of the Sonic franchise over the previous financial year were 5.8m, meaning Sonic Frontiers has achieved almost half of that in one month. 2017&#x27;s well received Sonic Mania reached 1m sales in one year.

                              <span>Twitch has removed LGB Alliance from its list of approved charities following backlash from streamers and viewers.
On 7th December, Twitch announced it had added &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of new global charities to its charity tool for streamers. The feature was added in July in a US-only beta, and became available to all partners in August. Twitch and Paypal Giving Fund do not take a cut of donations raised through the charity tool.
&quot;We added tens of thousands more Paypal-vetted charities from the US and dozens of different countries,&quot; Twitch stated in its blog announcement. The company came under fire from users when they discovered LGB Alliance, a UK-based hate group opposed to trans rights, was one of the new additions to Twitch&#x27;s approved charities. The group was controversially granted charity status in April 2021 by the UK government.

Unlike other big PlayStation releases, it is recommended that you have a colossal 32GB of RAM available on your PC to play Returnal at its best potential. 


For comparison, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and Horizon Zero Dawn both recommend having 16GB of RAM available - that is the minimum of what Returnal asks for. Meanwhile, God of War only asks for 8GB of RAM for the best PC experience.

                              <span>Microsoft reportedly offered Sony the option to add Call of Duty to its PlayStation Plus subscription service as part of its ongoing bid to acquire Activision Blizzard.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, who cited sources familiar with the negotiations between the two companies. This deal was allegedly made as part of Microsoft&#x27;s offer to Sony last month, which would see the Call of Duty series kept on PlayStation consoles for 10 years should the acquisition go through. 


Since Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard in a record-breaking deal worth $68.7bn, there have been concerns voiced about the presence of Call of Duty on other platforms.

As recorded on Armored Core 6&#x27;s Steam page, Miyazaki served as the game&#x27;s initial director, and Yamamura has now taken over that role.

Speaking to IGN, Miyazaki and Yamamura discussed some details of the game and addressed preconceptions people might have about it due to the game&#x27;s From Software has released over the past decade.

Write an essay in the style of Bruce Schneier on how ChatGPT will affect cybersecurity.
As with any new technology, the development and deployment of ChatGPT is likely to have a significant impact on the field of cybersecurity. In many ways, ChatGPT and other AI technologies hold great promise for improving the ability of organizations and individuals to defend against cyber threats. At the same time, however, the use of these technologies also raises important questions and concerns about the potential risks and challenges they may pose...</span>

                              <span>If you had hoped to take refuge in your newly acquired LA Thieves operator skin while playing Warzone 2.0, well here is your heads up - as part of the game&#x27;s Season 01 Reloaded update, it&#x27;s about to get a whole lot more visible. 

Once upon a time, this ensemble from Call of Duty eSports team LA Thieves basically allowed wearers to become one with the shadows thanks to its all-black design (bar a red embossed &quot;LA&quot; on the chest). However, it has now been given a colourful little update by Activision. So, yes, we will be able to see you now. 
As Ishraq reported earlier this month, this skin by LA Thieves was labelled  &quot;Roze 2.0&quot;, which is a reference to the Roze skin that was released for the original Warzone and Modern Warfare back in 2019. This skin was notoriously famous for making its wearer hard to see. In fact, following its release, Raven Software was forced to edit the skin to make it easier for other players to see the elusive Roze skin wearers.

                              <span>Just six months after its release, Nintendo looks like its putting Mario Strikers: Battle League on the sidelines.
The company announced the game&#x27;s next free update - wave 3 of additional content - will also be its last free update.
Previous DLC added Daisy, Shy Guy, Pauline, and Diddy Kong as playable characters, as well as new gear and stadiums. Watch the trailer for wave 3 below to see who&#x27;s been signed to the league next!

Directive 2022/2380, the amendment to existing EU regulation which will enforce the new charger rule, has now been published in the Official Journal of the EU, which reveals the deadline all phone manufacturers will have to comply by.

                              <span>Last week, it was The Game Awards. This annual event is a chance for developers and publishers to showcase their upcoming slate of games, with a smattering of awards in there as well.


However, following this year&#x27;s show, many couldn&#x27;t help but notice that Microsoft&#x27;s offerings seemed remarkably sparse. 


In fact, all we really got was a little &#x27;games here and games coming in 2023&#x27; teaser from the team, but nothing particularly firm. Despite this being the ideal opportunity to do so, we still have not had specific release dates announced for the likes of Starfield or Redfall - two of Xbox&#x27;s biggest upcoming exclusives.

This assurance comes from Naughty Dog&#x27;s own Neil Druckmann, who over the weekend told us not to worry as &quot;Ellie and Joel will grace the Steam Deck.&quot;



The Last of Us Part 1 remake was officially unveiled earlier this year after months of rumours. It made its way to the PlayStation 5 in September, and will make its PC debut on 3rd March next year. For those eager to get their hands on Joel and Ellie&#x27;s first story, the game is available to pre-purchase now via Steam and the Epic Games Store.

                              <span>The discourse around Days Gone continues.


Last week, former Days Gone director John Garvin controversially stated the reason the game didn&#x27;t receive universal acclaim was because of &quot;woke reviewers&quot; and reviewers who &quot;couldn&#x27;t be bothered to actually play the game&quot;. 

In addition to these unusual remarks, Garvin also threw the game&#x27;s programmers under the bus, blaming Days Gone&#x27;s &quot;tech issues&quot; such as &quot;bugs, streaming and frame rate&quot; for its middling reception.

                              <span>Digerati, publisher of The Outbound Ghost, has filed a lawsuit against its developer Conradical. 


Last week, lead developer Conrad Grindheim released a YouTube video explaining that his relationship with the publisher had &quot;dissolved&quot; and he was requesting the publisher return the publishing rights to him.



The dispute occurred due to Grindheim&#x27;s disappointment with the quality of the console release of the game, specifically on Switch. He allegedly vandalised the game&#x27;s store page on Steam in response, which has since been removed.

Apple says the only “major” categories not covered by Advanced Data Protection are iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendar because “of the need to interoperate with the global email, contacts, and calendar systems,” according to its press release...</span>

The Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG) Release is proud to announce that we
are digitally signing all release artifacts, and that this aspect of Kubernetes
has now reached beta.
Signing artifacts provides end users a chance to verify the integrity of the
downloaded resource. It allows to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks directly on
the client side and therefore ensures the trustfulness of the remote serving the
artifacts. The overall goal of out past work was to define the used tooling for
signing all Kubernetes related artifacts as well as providing a standard signing
process for related projects (for example for those in kubernetes-sigs).
We already signed all officially released container images (from Kubernetes v1.24 onwards).

                              <span>Goat Simulator 3&#x27;s Mandatory Holiday Update is now here.

The free update includes a host of &quot;festive goodies to ramp up that holiday spirit&quot;, including Santa hats, elf outfits, and &quot;weapons that shoot colourful lights&quot;. You can watch the brightly-coloured carnage in the teaser below:

Here to ensure that &quot;Ensure no NPC has a silent night&quot;, the game&#x27;s first content update since the sim released last month. As well as hats and outfits, you&#x27;ll also get Sack &amp; Sleigh - a feature that lets you pepper NPCs with wrapping paper and wrap them up - a lights machine gun with which you can place Christmas lights &quot;almost anywhere&quot;.

                              <span>The Witcher showrunner Lauren Hissrich has responded to The Witcher fans and insisted she has &quot;never mocked the books&quot; the video games and Netflix show is based upon.

The furor began when writer Beau DeMayo - who&#x27;s now working on X-Men &#x27;97 - says some of his colleagues in The Witcher&#x27;s writing room &quot;actively mocked&quot; the source material written by Andrzej Sapkowski.

&quot;I&#x27;ve been on show - namely Witcher - where some of the writers were not or actively disliked the books and games (even actively mocking the source material),&quot; DeMayo said in an interview back in October.

Conrad Grindheim - lead developer on The Outbound Ghost - took to YouTube to state that his relationship with his publisher, Digerati, had &quot;dissolved&quot; and wanted the publisher to return the publishing rights to him.

Stating that the indie title is &quot;not up to the quality standards of the games that I create and that you expect of me&quot;, he asked fans to avoid the game and said he was taking legal action to protect &quot;our company, our name, our reputation, and consumer&#x27;s rights&quot;.

Developed by MegaPixel Studio, The House of the Dead: Remake &quot;offers players around the world the joy to discover or rediscover this timeless arcade classic&quot; and is a &quot;state of the art remake&quot; complete with upgraded graphics, audio, and new game modes.

The Limidead Edition, as the name suggests, comes with a handful of additional goodies, too, including not only a copy of the game but an &quot;exclusive box with lenticular&quot; - which means it moves when you look at it from different angles - two cardboard character stands, and a sticker sheet.

The &quot;iconic&quot; Rundown 2.0 Infection is now available, reprising the inaugural Rundown that launched on the PC-only title way back in March 2020.

Not come across Rundowns before? They&#x27;re a snazzy name for what is essentially a regular game update that also ushers in new time-limited expeditions. Up until now, they&#x27;d always replaced the existing one, but now Rundown 2.0 Infection is the first of a &quot;planned rollout that will see every past GTFO Rundown since the game&#x27;s initial Early Access launch in December 2019 added back to the game&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 only released at the end of October, but it&#x27;s already the biggest-selling game of 2022 in the US.

Topping the November sales chart, that means Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has not only knocked Elden Ring off the coveted top spot, but it&#x27;s also resisted stiff competition from other games released last month, including God of War: Ragnarök and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. 

According to data from NPD and reported by VGC, that also makes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 the fastest-selling entry not just of the year, but of the franchise&#x27;s storied history, too, hitting $1bn in sales in just 10 days.

                              <span>Superb rhythm game Metal: Hellsinger has hit over a million players on PS5 and Xbox Series X and is now available on PS4 and Xbox One, too.

To celebrate, developer The Outsiders has &quot;new weapon skins to collect, combos to master, and Archdevil Mode to suffer&quot; the latter of which is an all new brutal difficulty level. There&#x27;s also a free digital artbook up for grabs, too.

The changes come courtesy of update 1.5, which as well as the usual bug fixes and QoL improvements, also invites players to &quot;rediscover each map in order to find Coats of Arms Collectibles&quot;.

                              <span>A Canadian court has approved a class-action lawsuit against the creators of Fortnite, Epic Games.

We first reported that the Canadian legal firm was preparing a class-action lawsuit against Epic Games back in 2019. It accused the developer of &quot;knowingly&quot; creating the &quot;very, very addictive game&quot;, Fortnite, but had been in limbo ever since as the court assessed whether or not the case could proceed.

Now, however, it seems the court agrees with the plaintiff that the claim &quot;does not appear to be frivolous or manifestly ill-founded&quot; and, according to CTV News, just because there&#x27;s &quot;no certainty&quot; that Epic created an &quot;addictive&quot; game it &quot;does not preclude the possibility that the game is in fact addictive and that its creator and distributor are presumed to know this&quot;.

Polygon reports that the lawsuit - filed in various countries right across the world, including the UK and Germany, due to varying copyright law - maintains free-to-play Hyper Front is &quot;a copy of substantial parts of Valorant&quot;, including its &quot;characters, maps, weapons, weapon skins, and charms&quot;.

Whilst player data for Hyper Front is currently unknown, Polygon points out that the Google Play Store says it has over a million downloads and almost 50,000 reviews. And whilst Hyper Front is currently unavailable in the US, where Riot is based, it is playable in many other territories where a mobile version of Valorant is currently in development and expected to release.

                              <span>This article talks about public land in the US that is completely surrounded by private land, which in some cases makes it inaccessible to the public. But there’s a hack:
Some hunters have long believed, however, that the publicly owned parcels on Elk Mountain can be legally reached using a practice called corner-crossing.
Corner-crossing can be visualized in terms of a checkerboard. Ever since the Westward Expansion, much of the Western United States has been divided into alternating squares of public and private land. Corner-crossers, like checker pieces, literally step from one public square to another in diagonal fashion, avoiding trespassing charges. The practice is neither legal nor illegal. Most states discourage it, but none ban it...</span>

This will be interesting to watch. If Eufy can ignore security researchers and the press without there being any repercussions in the market, others will follow suit. And we will lose public shaming as an incentive to improve security.</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s gradual tiptoe back onto Steam is set to continue, with the publisher&#x27;s enjoyable 2020 action-adventure Immortals Fenyx Rising now confirmed as heading to Valve&#x27;s platform.


Launched at the tail-end of 2020, Fenyx Rising followed the same pattern as all new Ubisoft PC releases since 2019, skipping Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12% revenue cut compared to Valve&#x27;s 30%.


However, it appeared Ubisoft&#x27;s position on its preferred storefronts was about to shift in November after listings for a Steam version of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla were discovered, and the move was confirmed by the publisher itself in December, when Valhalla, Anno 1800, and Roller Champions were all announced to be heading to Valve&#x27;s platform.

                              <span>If your eyes are in need of something soothing after blinking your way through the night and this year&#x27;s Game Awards, then may I introduce you to Europa, an absolutely lovely looking new adventure from developer Helder Pinto.


Sporting a gorgeous Ghibli-esque art style, Europa promises a &quot;peaceful game of adventure, exploration, and meditation&quot; on terraformed moon in Jupiter&#x27;s shadow. Here, among lakes, meadows, mountains, and the remnants of a fallen civilisation, players - cast as an android called Zee - can run, glide, and fly across the landscape as they try to uncover the story of their creator.


Alongside an &quot;intimate story about growing up and humanity&#x27;s relationship with nature&quot;, Europa promises puzzles, secrets, and hidden dangers, with players able to gradually upgrade their Zephyr jetpack to boost higher and further.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, it&#x27;s the morning after the night before - and what a night. While The Game Awards 2022 dominated the news, Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover faced a major setback with the FTC and Diablo 4&#x27;s big release date announcement was superseded by serious claims of mismanagement and crunch.  

The awards ceremony was an eventful affair, even without its climactic and rather concerning stage invasion. The typical array of trailers for games like Final Fantasy 16, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and Street Fighter 6 came thick and fast, alongside big announcements for things such as Death Stranding 2, Hades 2, Horizon Forbidden West PS5-only DLC and Armored Core 6. 
Did Geoff Keighley keep his pledge to make this year&#x27;s ceremony speedier? Not really. Somewhere, Christopher Judge is now on the second day of his acceptance speech. So, here for you today is a recap of everything we thought was really worth your time - and what we think Death Stranding 2 should actually be titled. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Wesley Yin-Poole.

                              <span>Developer Omega Force&#x27;s creature-battler Wild Hearts is inching ever closer to its February 2023 launch, and in the run-up to its release, the developer has introduced more of its behemoth targets in a new trailer.


Wild Hearts, a collaboration between Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series) and EA Originals, transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan.


This isn&#x27;t Omega Force&#x27;s first turn in the monster hunting genre, of course; it previously dabbled in its two Toukiden games, and Wild Hearts expands on those to introduce an experience where up to three players can seamlessly battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.

The Deluxe Edition is one of three now available to pre-order via Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.net, as well as the slightly cheaper £80 Digital Deluxe Edition, and the £60 Standard Edition.


All pre-purchases get you access to the game and its open beta, plus a handful of extra cosmetics. The two pricier versions add extra cosmetic options and the game&#x27;s seasonal battle pass, with the Ultimate Edition upgrading that latter reward into its &quot;accelerated&quot; version.

                              <span>Last night, we got another look at the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, Phantom Liberty. This trailer, while only a little over a minute and a half long, gave us a few surprises. Namely, the debut of Idris Elba&#x27;s Solomon Reed. 


You can see it for yourself below.


So, yes, there is Elba in character (also, hey Keanu!). But just who exactly is that character? Let&#x27;s Idris the Elba in the room...

                              <span>Tekken 8 got its moment in the sun at The Game Awards last night, and for fans of the long-running fighting game franchise like me, one thing stood out: Jun Kazama&#x27;s return.


Jun Kazama, Jin&#x27;s mother, made her debut in 1995&#x27;s Tekken 2 and hasn&#x27;t been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 27 years later, she&#x27;s back and it looks like she hasn&#x27;t aged a day. Tekken time logic, I guess.


The trailer below focuses on the Tekken 8 story (Tekken has an actual real life Guinness World Record for being the longest-running video game storyline!). Once again the Mishimas are at each other&#x27;s throats, with Tekken 8 picking up where Tekken 7 left off and the war between father and son Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama heating up. When all appears lost, Jin looks up and sees his mother&#x27;s dramatic return. I doubt there&#x27;s much interest in a family selfie.

                              <span>Brink and Gears Tactics developer Splash Damage is working on a new Transformers game for PC and consoles, which will launch in closed beta next year. 


Transformers: Reactivate was shown last night at The Game Awards 2022, with a fresh trailer you can see below. The project is being designed as an online action game for one to four players where you play as some of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters. And yes, you can transform between a vehicle and a bot (obviously!)


The news comes alongside word that Splash Damage has acquired Bulkhead, the UK studio behind World War 2 shooter Battalion 1944, which is also working on Transformers: Reactivate.

Earlier this year, Belarusian-based developer Sad Cat Studio announced it was delaying Replaced&#x27;s release into 2023 in light of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. 


&quot;The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families. As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced,&quot; the studio said in May.

                              <span>At last night&#x27;s Game Awards, a fairytale prequel for the Bayonetta series was announced called Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.



But there&#x27;s actually a playable teaser for the game hidden away in Bayonetta 3 - it&#x27;s been there all along since launch last month.


The teaser shows off the new childlike visuals and hints at the story, but until now it wasn&#x27;t clear what the hidden chapter related to.

                              <span>With a boom of a blessed bolter came gameplay of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 during The Game Awards last night, and while the heretical Eurogamer news team shrugged their shoulders, this loyal servant of the Emperor can confidently declare MUCH HYPE.


Saber Interactive&#x27;s hotly-anticipated (by me) sequel shows Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus stomp and shoot and generally smash to bits the xenos scum that is the Tyranids (they&#x27;re the evil aliens, Tom).


The setup here is pretty simple: the Tyranids are devouring worlds (nom nom) and it&#x27;s up to the Ultramarines to stem the tide. Cue big battles in which one man army Titus teaches the &#x27;nids a lesson in brutality.

The individual appeared to walk onto the stage alongside Elden Ring&#x27;s director Hidetaka Miyazaki and his entourage, and remained there while the esteemed developer gave his Game of the Year award acceptance speech. 


After being allowed to stay on stage apparently unnoticed for several minutes, the person then took to the microphone.

A first trailer for the game debuted tonight during 2022&#x27;s The Game Awards. It doesn&#x27;t give much away - or show proper gameplay - but here it is:

Here are all the announcements, trailers and news Geoff Keighley and co had to give the gaming world.
The Game Awards kicked off with a cinematic for Dead Cells DLC Return to Castlevania, which comes out Q1 2023. It&#x27;s a new Castelvania! Sort of.
We then got a short video for super popular roguelike shoot &#x27;em up Vampire Survivors on mobile. It&#x27;s out now!

Reeves, who will be reprising his role as Johnny Silverhand on the DLC&#x27;s release next year, will be joined by none other than Idris Elba.


Elba will be playing Solomon Reed, an &quot;FIA Agent for the New United States of America&quot;. His character will be pivotal to the expansion&#x27;s story. You can see both Reeves and Elba in the latest trailer for Phantom Liberty below.

&quot;Following a disastrous last mission, Antea is fatally wounded, becoming one of the spirits she loathes,&quot; teases Dontnod in its announcement, &quot;[and] the couple desperately searches for a way to liberate Antea from her new plight.&quot;

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards 2022 ceremony included a fresh excerpt from the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie, showing Mario himself get used to travelling via warp pipes. 


As is befitting his outsider status in the Mushroom Kingdom, Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario has a rough ride in his first pipe, while being shown around by Keegan-Michael Key&#x27;s Toad. He&#x27;s also not that great at platforming yet, either.


I love the music in this clip - a nice reworking of some classic Mario melodies. The clip ends with Mario reaching Princess Peach&#x27;s Castle. Let&#x27;s watch:

                              <span>There had been rumours, but now it&#x27;s a sure thing. The upcoming DLC for Horizon Forbidden West is known as Burning Shores, and it will be coming to PlayStation 5 (sorry to say, it is not releasing on PS4) on 19th April. 


The trailer for Burning Shores shows Aloy heading to the ruins of Los Angeles. The city is &quot;overgrown and fractured&quot;, and Aloy will need to explore it by air on the back of a Sunwing, and via the water. You can see its announcement trailer below. 


Here is the official word on Burning Shores from Guerrilla Games:

The online free-to-play role-player was previously announced for an early spring 2023 launch in Japan. Amazon is handling publishing duties for its wider launch, due in the second half of the year. 


Blue Protocol is described as a sci-fi fantasy adventure set on the war-torn planet of Regnas, following thousands of years of non-stop conflict. It&#x27;s your job to restore balance, save the planet, and also explore its surface for side-quests and mini-games.

                              <span>Following a tease of a partnership earlier this year, Joe Madureira&#x27;s Airship Syndicate studio and Warfare developer Digital Extremes have unveiled the former&#x27;s new free-to-play online action-RPG, Wayfinder, coming to PC and consoles next year.


Set in the fractured fantasy world of Evenor, players take on the role of Wayfinders as they embark on a quest of &quot;endless action and adventure&quot; to restore their home from a foul, consuming force known as the Gloom.


Airship (which made Ruined King: A League of Legends Story and Darksiders Genesis) says each playable Wayfinder comes with its own unique story, play style, and abilities - which can be augmented by using Echoes from fallen foes - with players able to wield arcane magic, mystical tech, and &quot;cunning&quot; weapons as they embark on hunts and expeditions to new locations.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 finally has a release date! It&#x27;s only narrowed down to a month, rather than a day, but here it is: August 2023. Mark it in your calendars and take the whole month off. Say Eurogamer said it was okay.
The August 2023 release date means Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 arrives, in full, just shy of three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, in October 2022. A lot has happened there of course - a lot of tweaking and tuning and honing the experience of the game. Its popularity allowed Larian to breathe and make BG3 a bigger, better thing.
Just for giggles: the August 2023 date also means BG3 arrives 23 years after BG2, and 25 years after the original Baldur&#x27;s Gate. I imagine you&#x27;re probably not laughing if you remember those.

                              <span>After months of speculation, Death Stranding 2 has been officially announced at The Game Awards. 


This news follows a tease earlier today from creator Hideo Kojima, that showed a blanked out visage with the words &quot;How come?&quot; written across it. Many guessed this face was that of Léa Seydoux, and they were right as she is very much front and centre of Death Stranding 2&#x27;s (or DS2&#x27;s) announcement trailer, which you can see below. 


Joining Seydoux are actors Norman Reedus (who previously let slip that the game was in development), Troy Baker, Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna. The game will be coming to PlayStation 5.

The Last of Us Part 1 initially launched for PlayStation 5 back in September, giving Naughty Dog&#x27;s acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror a significant makeover - and a PC version has been promised for quite some time.


And now, as part of tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, Naughty Dog has slapped a PC release date on its celebrated remake, confirming it&#x27;ll be launching in March next year.

Conroy sadly passed away earlier this year after a battle with cancer. He voiced Batman for over 30 years, starting in the 90s with Fox Kids&#x27; Batman: The Animated series, which would go on to run for 85 episodes between 1992 and 1995.

Titled as Judas and set for launch at some point in the future on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, the game is the first to come from Levine&#x27;s studio Ghost Story Games since he shut down his former studio Irrational Games after shipping BioShock Infinite.

                              <span>Publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment has unveiled Hellboy Web of Wyrd, a new roguelite action-adventure based on Mike Mignola&#x27;s comic series that&#x27;s coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


&quot;Welcome to the Butterfly House,&quot; teases the official announcement, &quot;a mysterious manor of perverse angles and non-Euclidean geometry built by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux to open a gateway to the Wyrd, a vast, interdimensional web of wondrous and horrifying planes of existence beyond our world. When a B.P.R.D. agent vanishes inside the mansion, it’s up to Hellboy and his team of agents to uncover its forbidden secrets.&quot;


Specifics are a little thin right now, but Hellboy Web of Wyrd - which is being developed by West of Dead studio Upstream Arcade - promises an original storyline crafted in collaboration with series creator Mike Mignola, as well as designed to evoke the visuals and atmosphere of the comics. It also stars the always welcome Lance Reddick in the lead role.

It&#x27;s with immense joy that we announce the release of Kubernetes v1.26!
This release includes a total of 37 enhancements: eleven of them are graduating to Stable, ten are

Kubernetes 1.26: Electrifying

                              <span>A new investigation into Diablo 4&#x27;s development has painted a picture of chaos and mismanagement at Activision Blizzard, reportedly resulting in a dash to meet a release date - said to be 6th June next year - that staff believe is &quot;unlikely&quot; to be met without &quot;many hours of overtime or cut features&quot;.


In a new report by The Washington Post, assembled after speaking with 15 current and former Blizzard employees, it&#x27;s claimed Diablo 4&#x27;s development was troubled from the off, with leadership at the time instilling the project with a &quot;sense of inertia&quot; as large parts of the game were constantly revamped and scrapped - including a planned battle royale mode.


Talking to The Washington Post, team members laid much of the early blame at director Luis Barriga and lead designer Jesse McCree, both of who left the studio in 2021, amid serious allegations of institutionalised discrimination and harassment at Activision Blizzard. Colleagues claim, for instance, McCree &quot;would grow intrigued by different aspects of the game and then lose interest and hand it off to other people without finishing what he started.&quot;

&quot;We continue to believe that this deal will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers,&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s vice chair and president Brad Smith said in a statement. &quot;We have been committed since Day One to addressing competition concerns, including by offering earlier this week proposed concessions to the FTC.&quot;


&quot;While we believed in giving peace a chance,&quot; Smith concluded, &quot;we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court.”

There&#x27;s more too, but the replay editor is undoubtedly the star of the show, giving players the tools to turn their favourite takedowns into cinematic mini-masterpieces. There are options to adjust camera placement, for instance, to define lens parameters, choreograph camera movement, and even add effects including slo-mo and speed-ups.


You can get a taste of the tools available in Sloclap&#x27;s autumn update trailer below.

                              <span>Activision has launched a fresh legal front in its ongoing battle against the State of California, which has been suing the Call of Duty publisher over reports of workplace misconduct and sexual harassment since the summer of 2021. 


In response, Activision has now filed its own lawsuit against California&#x27;s recently-renamed Civil Rights Department (CRD) - the same agency currently trying to sue Activision - over claims the department has taken too long with its own case and not been transparent over its connections with the media and labour unions (thanks, Axios). 


Activision is now asking a judge to force the CRD (previously the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, or DFEH) to produce various internal documents. These include details of the department&#x27;s discussions with the Communication Workers of America, the union which has been repeatedly in the headlines this year for helping organise games industry QA staff (including several teams at Activision).

                              <span>Ahead of an official announcement by the developer, Sony has accidentally leaked the existence of a Forspoken demo. 


A tweet from PlayStation Japan, that has since been deleted, was spotted making the rounds earlier today. Its translation reveals that a demo for Forspoken will be announced on 9th December.


Meanwhile, over on the main PlayStation account, the team has a small reel promoting an 11-minute long Forspoken stream that promises to show off new gameplay.

                              <span>It&#x27;s nearly Christmas, I&#x27;ve lost all feeling in my fingers due to the bitter cold and it&#x27;s time for an established December tradition to kick off the festive season - doing our very best to stay awake through the night for The Geoffs and all the magic it might bring. 


We&#x27;re promised a bumper show from The Game Awards tonight, with the inevitable Hideo Kojima-shaped announcement - Geoff can&#x27;t let a show go by without a nod to his bessie - plus news on the likes of Street Fighter 5, Jedi Survivor and Diablo 4 and plenty more besides. And only a small amount of it has leaked ahead of time! 


The show kicks off at 12.30am, and while we&#x27;re also promised a more compact running order than previous years I&#x27;d expect a runtime north of two hours. So do bring caffeine, and lots of it.

                              <span>Nintendo has wielded its heavy hand once more, this time on popular YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming. 


The channel, which frequently reports on trivia from a specific game or franchise, has been issued a takedown notice from Nintendo. This takedown pertains specifically to Did You Know Gaming&#x27;s video on Heroes of Hyrule - a Zelda game for the Nintendo DS akin to Final Fantasy Tactics, that was pitched to Nintendo by Retro Studios.


In response to this notice, Did You Know Gaming stated it considers this move by Nintendo a &quot;slap in the face for video game history preservation&quot;.

                              <span>Have you ever reached Minecraft&#x27;s end credits? Doing so requires visiting its hard-to-reach The End dimension and defeating the Elder Dragon boss who dwells there. 


If you have got past this point, you&#x27;ll likely remember the bizarre eight-minute scrolling text story which comes next, before the end credits begin proper. 


It&#x27;s a truly odd read - structured as a conversation between two higher beings apparently observing you - the player. Perhaps even odder, it was never officially licensed to Minecraft developer Mojang, and subsequently is not owned by Microsoft.

The Metal Gear Solid creator has been releasing a steady stream of mysterious teasers for his upcoming game for a while now, and today brings us one more.


Like his previous ones for Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna, this latest teaser shows a blanked out visage with some cryptic wording written across it (which, in this case, reads &quot;How come?&quot;).

                              <span>Upon its release, Days Gone was met with middling reviews across the board. In our own review, in which Sony Bend&#x27;s take on a zombie apocalypse was not awarded a badge, Malindy Hetfeld described it as &quot;a shallow copy of many better open-world action games&quot;.


And Malindy wasn&#x27;t alone in thinking this way. Even the powers that be at Sony reportedly didn&#x27;t feel the game warranted a sequel. 


But, according to Days Gone director John Garvin, the game itself was not to blame for this tepid reception. Rather, it &quot;failed&quot; because of a combination of &quot;tech issues&quot;, &quot;reviewers who couldn&#x27;t be bothered to actually play the game&quot; and &quot;woke reviewers who couldn&#x27;t handle a gruff white biker looking at his date&#x27;s ass.&quot; Errm, ok then.

Racing ahead in first place after some perfect corner drifting and expertly timed green shell throwing, you&#x27;re slammed with a blue shell ahead of the finish line and drop back into last place. Is there anything more infuriating?


No more! A new update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch adds a custom item option and it&#x27;s the best thing to happen to the game. 


Honestly I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s taken Nintendo this long to implement. Yes, items are used to even out the skill levels of racers as well as increase the mayhem, but item customisation was included in Super Smash Bros years ago. Finally Mario Kart gets the same treatment.

The PS5 has proved hard to find ever since it arrived two years ago, with stock problems leading to shortages and scalping. 


PS5 availability has been a global issue, though one Sony now says it has solved in its home country. Speaking at the recent PlayStation Partner Awards event in Japan, company boss Jim Ryan said the console&#x27;s ongoing supply problems had now finally been put to bed.

                              <span>A release date for Street Fighter 6 has popped up on the PlayStation Store, hours ahead of its likely promotion tonight at this year&#x27;s The Game Awards. 


According to the listing, Street Fighter 6 will launch on 2nd June 2023, with a Standard and Deluxe Edition - the latter of which will include the game&#x27;s Year 1 Character Pass.


A third option, for the game&#x27;s Ultimate Edition, replaces the Year 1 Character Pass for the Year 1 Ultimate Pass. We may find out more about all that this evening.

                              <span>A lorry containing over £500k of Evercade EXP Limited Edition stock has been reported stolen, in what developer Blaze Entertainment has described as a &quot;terrible, potentially organised attack&quot;. 


Exact details of the theft are unclear, though it&#x27;s reported the incident took place as stock was being moved between warehouses. Nobody was injured, but all stock was taken.


The £130 gaming handhelds had been destined for despatch to customers in the UK and USA, and elsewhere in the world outside of Europe. A separate consignment bound for customers in mainland Europe is unaffected.

                              <span>Sony is giving players the opportunity to try out the online multiplayer portion of its PlayStation Plus subscription service for free this weekend, starting on Saturday, 10th December.


That means anyone can put PlayStation 4 and 5&#x27;s online multiplayer through its paces - teaming up with friends, strangers, or other non-specific entities across all multiplayer-supporting games - between 10th-11th December without needing to cough up the usual fee.


The requirements to particpate are fairly obvious: players will need to register a PSN account, will need an active internet connection, and will need access to a game that supports online play. Why not, for instance, give Elden Ring&#x27;s new PvP-focused Colosseum update a try?

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play mobile shooter The Division Resurgence is launching a closed-beta-style &quot;live test&quot; tomorrow, 8th December, for select participants on Android - and there&#x27;s a new trailer to accompany the announcement.


Resurgence (not to be confused with Heartland, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play Division game for PC and consoles), will, like other titles in the series, be an open-world third-person shooter RPG set in post-crisis America - specifically, Manhattan - following a deadly virus outbreak.


Ubisoft&#x27;s previous chatter around Resurgence has promised a fresh story campaign offering a &quot;new perspective on key story events&quot; from past The Division games, with players once again being cast as agents allied to the Strategic Homeland.

                              <span>Legendary game designer Jeff Minter and his Llamasoft outfit is back with another blast of psychedelic shooter action, this time in the form of Akka Arrh - a &quot;reimagining&quot; of an &#x27;80s arcade cabinet game that never actually released.


This, of course, is a somewhat different scenario to Minter&#x27;s Polybius, which was inspired by an &#x27;80s arcade cabinet game that never actually existed. Akka Arrh, though, is very much a thing, having been designed by Atari&#x27;s Mike Hally and Dave Ralston as a prototype back in 1982.


Minter&#x27;s reimagining of Akka Arrh - of which only three cabinets are still said to exist - has been created in partnership with Atari, and promises &quot;a cascade of words, colour, shapes and sound [flowing] around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers&quot;.

                              <span>Delightful VR fantasy adventure Moss and its sequel have been confirmed as PSVR2 launch titles, with both games arriving alongside Sony&#x27;s new hardware on 22nd February next year.


The original Moss, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, initially launched as a PSVR exclusive back in 2018, gaining widespread acclaim for its charming tale of a tiny mouse, Quill, on a journey through a beautiful, human-sized fantasy world. Eurogamer called it &quot;the finest PSVR game to date&quot;.


Its best trick was its hybrid first-person/-third-person perspective, giving players full control over Quill while simultaneously letting them view the action through the eyes of a spirit, able to interact with the environment to solve puzzles and help Quill on her journey.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to the early 90s and you may recall two aliens with a love for funk music crash landing on earth. These aliens were ToeJam and Earl, and their initial crash landing here (all via the Sega Mega Drive) resulted in their names being elevated to somewhat of a cult status in the industry. 


Now, over 30 years since their first landing, ToeJam and Earl will soon be coming to a new medium. Yes, these two aliens will be joining the likes of Lara Croft, Nathan Drake and Mario, who have all made the transition to the big screen. 


Per The Hollywood Reporter, a new feature film from Amazon based on ToeJam and Earl&#x27;s video game escapades will be heading our way sometime in the future. This upcoming project will be written by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, whose previous work includes Hotel Transylvania 4. Meanwhile, basketball player Stephen Curry will also be producing the project through his production company Unanimous Media.

                              <span>No blue shells? ALL BLUE SHELLS? Beautiful, perpetual chaos can now be yours whenever you desire, thanks to a free new Mario Kart 8 Deluxe update enabling players to define exactly which items they want to appear in their games.


As detailed in Nintendo&#x27;s announcement tweet, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s new custom item feature works with offline VS races, as well as &quot;certain&quot; online modes, and gives players the ability to either randomise items that&#x27;ll be available in their races or to toggle specific items on or off. And yes, that means competitions can now be entirely item-free.


That&#x27;s not quite the end of it, either; in Team Races and Battles, it&#x27;s even possible to allocate items to specific teams, meaning you can really pile on the pressure - perhaps all spiny shells against an increasingly sweaty palmed team armed with nothing but hooters?

                              <span>Fans of Sonic the Hedgehog and Genshin Impact are fighting over various claims of foul play in relation to this year&#x27;s Players&#x27; Voice fan vote at tomorrow&#x27;s Game Awards.


The Players&#x27; Voice category is a 100 percent fan-voted award which this year has five possible choices as its finalists: Elden Ring, Genshin Impact, Stray, God of War Ragnarok and Sonic Frontiers. Over the past week, the vote has become mired in controversy amidst accusations of a broken poll, bots and bribery.


To be clear, there&#x27;s no credible evidence of bribery, despite various fan claims foul play must be to blame for both Sonic (with a lower Metacritic score than other entrants) and Genshin Impact (whose detractors point out was first released in 2020) being way-off in the lead.

As part of this announcement, Spencer stated &quot;Microsoft is committed to helping bring more games to more people - however they choose to play.&quot;


So, how do people choose to play Call of Duty? Well, for this current generation of consoles at least, not on a Nintendo Switch. There simply just isn&#x27;t the option to do so.

Japanese newspaper Asahi reported today that Naka now stands accused of violating financial laws in relation to another mobile game it is claimed he had insider knowledge of - Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier.


Specifically, Naka is accused of purchasing 144.7m yen&#x27;s worth of shares in its developer ATeam (worth around £865k) before The First Soldier was officially announced.

                              <span>Fortnite continues to be a fixture of England&#x27;s World Cup squad, four years after the popular battle royale&#x27;s celebration dances became a common sight on Russia&#x27;s pitches.


This week, England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was shown footage of himself lugging a monogrammed computer case to 2022&#x27;s controversial Qatar tournament, as part of an official interview released on the England squad YouTube channel.


Pickford was asked what he was getting up to during his downtime - and, amongst other things, eventually revealed he was still hooked to Fortnite. (And no wonder - its freshly-minted Chapter 4 has reinvented the game.)

In short, some mods will still work, but others won&#x27;t (especially those based on scripts) - and CD Projekt has tested and compiled a list of how the most popular will fare so fans and mod makers can prepare ahead of time.


A further group of mods will be included as part of the update - now part of the game proper, with their original creators reimbursed and credited.

                              <span>Microsoft has agreed a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo if its buyout of Activision Blizzard goes through.


Xbox boss Phil Spencer tweeted the announcement, which also confirms the company&#x27;s commitment to continue to release Call of Duty games on Valve&#x27;s Steam platform &quot;simultaneously to Xbox&quot;, if the gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard is approved. Call of Duty&#x27;s latest releases, Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, are already on Steam.


The announcement is a direct response to the scrutiny the acquisition has come under from a raft of organisations across the world, chief among them the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK.

                              <span>This is a really interesting paper that discusses what the authors call the Decoupling Principle:
The idea is simple, yet previously not clearly articulated: to ensure privacy, information should be divided architecturally and institutionally such that each entity has only the information they need to perform their relevant function. Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</span>

Those looking to add a bit more visual pizazz to GTA Online on current-gen consoles will have the option to activate real-time ray-traced reflections - which will be applied across &quot;many&quot; surfaces - via the Fidelity Mode graphics setting when the update hits.


Elsewhere in December&#x27;s update, Rockstar is making the retro-styled Declasse Tahoma Coupe available for purchase by all for a limited time in celebration of players collectively amassing four trillion GTA$ in the recent Heists Challenge.

                              <span>Eight years since its initial unveiling and multiple delays later, Dead Island 2 is finally almost upon us - and ahead of its launch next April, publisher Deep Silver has shared more of its open-world, zombie-pulverising antics in a new digital showcase.


Those with itchy fast-forward fingers will be pleased to know the vast majority of Dead Island 2&#x27;s 15-minute showcase is taken up by largely uninformative live-action sequences, featuring a group of zombie apocalypse survivors as they stumble across a copy of Dead Island 2 in a fancy LA mansion. It&#x27;s entirely inessential fluff, but, tucked between all that, Deep Silver does manage to squeeze in a few minutes of gameplay.


Admittedly, there&#x27;s little that&#x27;s particularly revelatory in there - the publisher basically just used the time to reiterate the obvious fact you&#x27;ll mostly be maiming various zombie types gruesomely until they&#x27;re dead - but it did give us a decent new look at Dead Island 2&#x27;s appealingly sun-kissed gore, as well as a taste of its weapon roster, including hammers, machetes, bear claws, a &quot;shit-tonne of guns&quot;, and various makeshift tools of destruction.

                              <span>Halo Infinite has released its December update, bringing with it the earlier-than-anticipated arrival of a custom game browser, an updated version of Halo 3&#x27;s The Pit map, and more.


Halo Infinite&#x27;s new custom game browser is designed to work in tandem with the Forge Beta introduced as part of November&#x27;s Winter Update. It was originally planned for release as part of next year&#x27;s Season 3, but as developer 343 Industries explains in its blog post, &quot;We fully agree with players who felt [it] should be a priority — it&#x27;s a key support structure for what players create in Forge and a pillar for the community.&quot; 343 says this initial V1 release is &quot;likely to have some rough edges&quot; but will continue to evolve over time.


Elsewhere, today&#x27;s update introduces Empyrean, a &quot;reimagining&quot; of Halo 3&#x27;s The Pit map that&#x27;s been officially rebuilt in Forge by 343. &quot;How do Halo Infinite&#x27;s toys, like its limited-use Equipment, alter some of those dynamics and affect how you traverse the combat dance floor?,&quot; the developer asks in its introduction. &quot;Maybe the enemy team managed to grab the rockets first, but you went and acquired the Repulsor to protect yourself... We can&#x27;t wait to see what new memories are forged in this proving ground!

                              <span>Hindsight, the acclaimed narrative adventure from developer Joel MacDonald and publisher Annapurna Interactive - in which players experience a woman&#x27;s entire life, from birth to the present day - is now available on Xbox One and PlayStation. 


Hindsight is the follow-up McDonald&#x27;s acclaimed iOS botanical puzzler Prune (McDonald is also a former Call of Duty designer) and tells the story of a woman revisiting her childhood home following her mother&#x27;s death. As she sorts through her old belongings, she unlocks old memories that players can experience first-hand in the form of dioramas.


&quot;Hindsight asks you to slow down and pay attention to the little things left behind,&quot; explains the game&#x27;s official blurb. &quot;Piece these things together and shift your viewpoint until you find just the right perspective to pull you deeper into the past... Linger as long as you wish, but sooner or later you must come back to the present.&quot;

                              <span>Vampire Survivors, the acclaimed minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is getting its first dollop of paid DLC next week in the form of Legacy of the Moonspell, arriving next Thursday, 15th December, on Xbox and PC.


&quot;In eastern lands, a clan has fallen,&quot; explains Poncle in its DLC announcement post. &quot;The Moonspell, once vigilant guardians of a sorcerous valley nestled in the mountains, have been overrun by hordes of yokai and oni. Though treacherous, this hive of spectral activity may provide some clue as to the location of a vampire. If not, at least it&#x27;ll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process.&quot;


More specifically, Legacy of the Moonspell introduces eight new characters - including Miang Moonspell, Menya Moonspell, Syuuto Moonspell, and Babi-Onna - plus new monsters, six new music tracks, and a &quot;huge&quot; new stage incorporating the likes of an abandoned castle, yokai-infested village, and snow-covered mountain.

                              <span>Metroid Prime developer Retro Studio once had an idea for an XCOM-style game starring Samus Aran.


The concept, dubbed Metroid Tactics, was the brainchild of Metroid Prime developer Paul Tozer. The idea was one of several pitched following the conclusion of Retro&#x27;s Metroid Prime trilogy - and another which was ultimately turned down. 


Tozer discussed the pitch publicly for the first time this week in a new Did You Know Gaming video which details the game&#x27;s planned setting and storyline as a prequel to the entire Metroid series.

The emote, named &quot;Tidy&quot;, allows your character to dance like Snoop Dogg in his 2004 song Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot. It&#x27;s one of a handful of emotes from Fortnite&#x27;s early days thought to use unlicensed dance moves - other examples of which sparked largely-unsuccessful legal threats from individuals keen to take Epic Games to court. 


Fans were surprised to see the emote return upon the Item Shop&#x27;s midnight UK time refresh - though its appearance was shortlived, and it was pulled from sale just a couple of hours later.

Key art from marketing material show-off a Japanese theme, with artwork teasing the return of the classic map Castle (thanks, WhatIfGaming).   


Castle was originally a multiplayer map in Call of Duty World at War, set in an old Japanese fortress in World War 2. The map most recently made a return in Call of Duty Vanguard, but this would be the first time the map would appear in the franchise&#x27;s modern theme of shooters.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has announced plans to wind down support for Gwent, its Witcher card game spin-off, and laid out how it will hand over future balancing decisions to Gwent&#x27;s community of players.


The game&#x27;s final 72 cards will release next year in three expansions, set to launch in April, July and September 2023. After this time, CD Projekt will transition from its own monthly balance changes to a system voted on by players. 


Dubbed as &quot;Project Gwenfinity&quot;, the idea is that Gwent can be left to just a skeleton crew within CD Projekt to keep an eye on, while the game&#x27;s community decides on tweaks to exisiting cards to keep up with the current meta.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s big Disney Dreamlight Valley does more than add content themed around Toy Story and Lilo and Stitch - it also brings some welcome performance improvements, tweaks and bug fixes. 


Patch notes promise &quot;optimised game stability on all platforms&quot; but for Nintendo Switch in particular, where developer Gameloft has put a &quot;considerable focus&quot; this time around. 


The popular Disney life sim is now fully compatible with Steam Deck and verified by Steam.

Following a four-week election process, should the majority of workers support unionisation, Microsoft, who purchased Zenimax for $7.5bn in 2021, will recognise the union. 


The company has also pledged to remain neutral throughout this process. &quot;We applaud Microsoft for remaining neutral through this process and letting workers decide for themselves whether they want a union,&quot; said CWA president Christopher Shelton.

                              <span>Microsoft has formally confirmed its offer of a 10-year contract to keep releasing Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms after its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In an opinion article on the deal published in the Wall St Journal,  Microsoft president Brad Smith committed to making its 10-year COD contract &quot;legally enforceable by regulators in the US, UK and European Union&quot; - territories in which the company was previously felt to be struggling to get its acquisition agreed without making some sort of concessions.


The majority of the opinion piece repeats the same arguments for the deal we&#x27;ve heard from Microsoft many times before - that it would be good for both consumers and game developers, and that Microsoft is still struggling in a sector where it is &quot;stuck behind Sony&#x27;s dominant PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox will join the growing trend of selling new blockbuster console games for $70 (likely £70) next year. 


This includes the biggest hitters from Microsoft&#x27;s first-party line-up for 2023, such as Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield, Arkane&#x27;s Redfall and the company&#x27;s own Forza Motorsport reboot.


Of course, as is standard on Xbox, all of these will continue to be made available on day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. There&#x27;s no suggestion today of any other pricing being changed - such as for that subscription service, or for Xbox hardware.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has shed more light on the reason why multiplayer never materialised for Cyberpunk 2077. 
Simply put, the game&#x27;s rocky 2020 launch changed the studio&#x27;s plans. CD Projekt Red had to prioritise fixing the single-player experience, and multiplayer suffered as a result.
&quot;We really needed to look at what were the priorities for Cyberpunk [after it launched],&quot; Philipp Weber told me when I visited the studio last week. Weber was senior quest designer and coordinator on Cyberpunk 2077. Today, he&#x27;s acting narrative director of the new Witcher game codenamed Polaris.

                              <span>Earlier this year, we were all surprised to hear that Henry Cavill was stepping away from Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher adaptation. In his stead, The Hunger Games&#x27; Liam Hemsworth would be taking over the role of Geralt of Rivia for the show&#x27;s fourth season.


Now, Netflix is doing what it can to reassure fans that, while this will clearly be a change for the series, it will also bring a &quot;different energy&quot; to the show that the producers are excited about.

Speaking at The Witcher: Blood Origin&#x27;s UK junket, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich addressed the series&#x27; recasting with a variety of outlets.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 will be re-released with a Game of the Year edition, developer CD Projekt has confirmed. 


As you might expect, this package will include next year&#x27;s paid-for Phantom Liberty expansion, as well as all other free updates released so far. 


The announcement of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s Game of the Year Edition package has raised some eyebrows considering the game&#x27;s state in the year that it launched, though the &quot;GOTY Edition&quot; branding has now been so over-used it should hardly come as a surprise.

                              <span>Music-mixing rhythm game Fuser will go offline on 19th December, developer Harmonix announced today. 


Existing owners of the game will be able to continue playing the game&#x27;s Campaign and Quick Play modes with any previously-purchased DLC after this date - though offline only. 


A blog post on Fuser&#x27;s website announced the shutdown of live services last week, and confirmed the game and its DLC would all be withdrawn from sale.

According to Steam, players will be able to head to a galaxy far, far away with Cal Kestis on 16th March, 2023. This date was visible briefly this afternoon - though has now been changed to &quot;coming soon&quot;.


Many were expecting Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s release date to be revealed at The Game Awards this Thursday, so we will let you know when this date is made official.

                              <span>Panda, the eSports organisation at the centre of a high-profile row between Super Smash Bros. fans and Nintendo, has ditched its controversial CEO following complaints about his behaviour. 


In a statement issued this morning via Twitter, Panda confirmed it had &quot;heard the concerns of the Smash community&quot; and booted out its boss Alan Bunney. The company will now work with &quot;outside advisors to form a temporary interim management committee&quot; as players quit the company&#x27;s events in their dozens.


It follows a week of bad press for Bunney and his company, as it emerged Nintendo was shutting down a fan-run Smash Bros. tournament and continuing to partner with Panda.

                              <span>This weekend, we got another look at HBO&#x27;s upcoming The Last of Us TV adaptation. 


I am a big The Last of Us fan (something you may have noticed), and have watched this trailer multiple times already. Now, for your pleasure, I have pulled out some of the little details that you may have missed on a first watch. 


As a quick recap before we dive on in, you can see this trailer below. Please note, after the video I will be discussing points that could be considered spoilers for Naughty Dog&#x27;s video game series. If you are keen to avoid these, this is your cue to head elsewhere.

It&#x27;s this Discord server that was targeted with a subpoena by the gatcha game&#x27;s publishing label Cognosphere.

                              <span>Blizzard&#x27;s Albany-based band of Diablo testers have now formally formed a union, following months of delay.


The small QA (quality assurance) team at Blizzard Albany first anounced its intent to unionise back in July this year. 


The team now becomes the second group of testers within Activision Blizzard to successfully do so, following the similarly long-running push by QA staff at Call of Duty studio Raven Software.

In the UK weekly boxed game chart, the new Need for Speed only managed to chart in 17th place - that&#x27;s behind last year&#x27;s Just Dance 2022 and the Lego Harry Potter Collection. 


UK sales data seen by GamesIndustry.biz reveals the game&#x27;s physical sales were down 64 percent on the series&#x27; previous entry, 2019&#x27;s Need for Speed: Heat.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission reportedly looks to be leaning towards an approval of Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover.


Previously, the FTC&#x27;s involvement in the deal had signalled a headache for Microsoft, which is facing regulatory approval around the world, and close scrutiny here in the UK. A lawsuit looked imminent - potentially blocking the acquisition, or carving out major concessions.


However, a fresh report by the New York Post into the FTC panel set to decide the deal&#x27;s fate suggests the trade body is now looking more likely to let it pass.

                              <span>Striking Distance has released a new patch for The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s console versions. This follows on from its PC patch, which was released over the weekend.


This console patch is set to take aim at the various frame-rate and crashing issues that have been widely reported since the game&#x27;s release last Friday. 


&quot;We are listening, working hard on updates, and will have details to share on more upcoming improvements early this week,&quot; the developer wrote before thanking everyone for their ongoing patience.

As an actual human and not a bot, I had no idea how to answer. Is this a joke? (Seems not.) Is it a Magritte-like existential question? (It’s not a bicycle. It’s a drawing of a bicycle. Actually, it’s a photograph of a drawing of a bicycle. No, it’s really a computer image of a photograph of a drawing of a bicycle.) Am I overthinking this? (Definitely.)

It’s probably the best CAPTCHA I have ever encountered; a computer would have just answered...</span>

Forensic container checkpointing is based on Checkpoint/Restore In
Userspace (CRIU) and allows the creation of stateful copies
of a running container without the container knowing that it is being
checkpointed. The copy of the container can be analyzed and restored in a
sandbox environment multiple times without the original container being aware
of it. Forensic container checkpointing was introduced as an alpha feature in
Kubernetes v1.25.
How does it work?
With the help of CRIU it is possible to checkpoint and restore containers.
CRIU is integrated in runc, crun, CRI-O and containerd and forensic container
checkpointing as implemented in Kubernetes uses these existing CRIU
integrations.
Why is it important?
With the help of CRIU and the corresponding integ…</span>

                              <span>The creator of the acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer, Dead Cells, has revealed their next project: Nuclear Blaze. 

Sébastien Bénard&#x27;s Nuclear Blaze is expected to release on consoles on 28th April, 2023 and will set you back €15/$15 (sorry, I don&#x27;t have UK specific pricing at the time of writing) for a digital copy, and €30/$30 if you fancy a physical copy on either Switch or PS4. 

You&#x27;ll have to jump over to Red Art Games to pre-order a physical copy, although by doing so, you&#x27;ll secure a set of three &quot;Exclusive Nuclear Balze enamel pins&quot;. Physical copies also include a booklet including an interview with Bénard and a keychain.

                              <span>Fortnite will be reborn on Sunday 4th December, when the game returns with its fresh Chapter 4 map.


The next era of Fortnite will welcome characters such as The Witcher&#x27;s Geralt, Doomslayer and The Hulk, plus new gameplay mechanics such as the addition of motorbikes to Epic&#x27;s hugely-popular battle royale.


Last night, Fortnite ditched its third map with shocking speed, as the game&#x27;s ever-changing Island was quickly consumed by the invading Chrome in a brief cutscene.

                              <span>A patch is now available for the PC version of The Callisto Protocol.

Since the sci-fi horror released yesterday, players have taken to Striking Distance&#x27;s social media channels to complain about the stuttering plaguing the PC version of the game, which even Digital Foundry&#x27;s John calls &quot;unplayable&quot;.

Yesterday, the studio said in a statement: &quot;We&#x27;re aware that some users are experiencing stuttering issues on the PC. We&#x27;ve got a patch that will be available in a few hours to improve performance, with a number of additional updates on the way.&quot;

In a tweet, Tom French said it had been a &quot;massive honour to have been part of a game [they] loved so much&quot; and that they &quot;couldn&#x27;t be more proud of my time at 343&quot;.

&quot;After over 11 and a half years on Halo, I step out of my Spartan armor for the last time today to head off to new adventures,&quot; French tweeted last night.

In an interview with DidYouKnowGaming?, Wolpaw offered some exciting behind-the-scenes secrets from the Portal series, including &quot;tidbits about Wheatley and Cave Johnson, unused lore, an unlikely inspiration from Super Metroid, cut content from Portal 2, and what the future might hold for Portal 3&quot;.

&quot;Yeah, Jay [Pinkerton] and I have an idea that we think is pretty awesome for what would happen, generally speaking,&quot; Wolpaw said (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;We don&#x27;t have a script or any details worked out, but we have sort of a starting point that we like a ton.

                              <span>We know that complexity is the worst enemy of security, because it makes attack easier and defense harder. This becomes catastrophic as the effects of that attack become greater.
In A Hacker’s Mind (coming in February 2023), I write:
Our societal systems, in general, may have grown fairer and more just over the centuries, but progress isn’t linear or equitable. The trajectory may appear to be upwards when viewed in hindsight, but from a more granular point of view there are a lot of ups and downs. It’s a “noisy” process.
Technology changes the amplitude of the noise. Those near-term ups and downs are getting more severe. And while that might not affect the long-term trajectories, they drastically affect all of us living in the short term. This is how the twentieth century could—statistically—both be the most peaceful in human history and also contain the most deadly wars...</span>

That&#x27;s according to Deadline, which suggests the movie will retain the same basic kung-fu-infused revenge plot as Sloclap&#x27;s video game, complete with the twist that its protagonist gets steadily older each time they&#x27;re resurrected by their magical pendant upon death, despite the world around them staying the same.


Deadline says the movie is being described as &quot;John Wick meets M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s Old&quot;.

The Grasslands Animal Pack is Planet Zoo&#x27;s fourth paid expansion this year, and its 12th expansion since releasing in 2019. It introduces eight new exhibit creatures with a loose theme of &quot;steppes, plains and prairies&quot;, alongside a new Career Mode scenario.


On the animal front, Grasslands purchasers will gain access to the nine-banded armadillo, the maned wolf, the emu, the caracal, the red-necked wallaby, the striped hyena, and the blue wildebeest. It also introduces five species of butterfly that can be displayed as part of a walkthrough exhibit: the Cloudless Sulphur, European Peacock, Menelaus Blue Morpho, Monarch, and Old World Swallowtail.

                              <span>Developer Digital Extremes has announced the long-awaited arrival of cross-play support for its free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, meaning Tenno on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC can finally join forces wherever they may be.


Cross-play was initially announced during Digital Extremes&#x27; TennoCon fan event in July 2021, with the developer saying it hoped to launch the feature before the end of that year. It obviously missed that target and then some, but, 12 months later, cross-play is finally here.


&quot;Warframe will always be a game best played and enjoyed with friends and that&#x27;s why launching Cross Platform Play is such an incredible moment for us,&quot; Digital Extremes&#x27; chief operating officer Sheldon Carter said in a statement announcing the news. &quot;Together with our partners, we have broken down the walls that have prevented our players from experiencing the thrill of Warframe as one united community.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has shared a lengthy statement in response to recent claims it told organisers of the unofficial Smash World Tour that the popular fan competition, including this month&#x27;s concluding Smash World Tour Championships, could &quot;no longer operate&quot;.


The Smash World Tour, an &quot;international tournament circuit in which competitors for both Ultimate and Melee can qualify for the Smash World Tour Championships&quot;, is described by organisers as the &quot;the largest esports tour in history, for any game title&quot;. This year&#x27;s event, which ran between March and November, incorporated 6,400 live events around the world, attracting 325,000 in-person entrants.


With the tour now concluded, this year&#x27;s Smash World Tour Championships was due to beheld between 9th-11th December, but organisers announced on Tuesday (as reported by Kotaku) they had &quot;received notice the night before Thanksgiving from Nintendo that we could no longer operate&quot;. As such, December&#x27;s Championships and the entirety of next year&#x27;s Smash World Tour have been cancelled.

                              <span>The developer behind My Time At Portia has announced a new management sim, Let&#x27;s School, which is due to launch in 2023.


It&#x27;s a change of tack from a studio better known for its Harvest Moon-style life simulations - such as Portia and its follow-up My Time at Sandrock. Let&#x27;s School looks instead to be more in the vein of Theme Hospital - or more specifically, the recent school-set Two Point Campus.


Let&#x27;s School is described as a &quot;cosy and colourful&quot; management sim where, as headteacher, you design everything from the school&#x27;s building layout to its school clubs.

                              <span>Nintendo once had bold plans to quickly branch out into a raft of mobile game releases - but no more. When it launched its first app, Miitomo, back in 2016, Nintendo&#x27;s then-boss Tatsumi Kimishima said four more smartphone games would debut in the following 12 months.


In reality, Nintendo took several years to hit that milestone, and in the years since has shuttered several of them. Just one new Nintendo mobile game has launched in the last two years: Pikmin Bloom, developed by Pokémon Go maker Niantic.


This week, as Dragalia Lost joined Dr. Mario World and Miitomo on Nintendo&#x27;s shutdown game scrap pile, the publisher offered a brief update on the continued importance it places on its smartphone efforts.

                              <span>Neon White, the stylish Annapurna-published anime speedrunner, is coming to PlayStation platforms for the first time.


PlayStation 4 and PS5 versions of the game will arrive in just over a week, on Tuesday 13th December, following the game&#x27;s debut on Nintendo Switch and Steam earlier this year.


Neon White tasks you with shooting through levels - both in terms of the guns you fire and the speed in which you traverse. A single-player first-person shooter, it arms you with a variety of guns you can then trade-in for parkour moves via a card-based system, with the aim being to finish levels as quickly and cleanly as possible. Here&#x27;s a look at how it all works:

Earlier this year, Google announced the closure of its beleaguered cloud gaming service, stating it aims to have all refunds completed by 18th January 2023 - the date Stadia servers are switched off for good.
Now, the Stadia Twitter account has confirmed that those who made their hardware purchases via its Google Store should start seeing their refunds coming in.

                              <span>Three Rare veterans - David Wise, Grant Kirkhope, and Kevin Bayliss - have banded together in the spirit of the holidays to release a video-game-themed Christmas single.


Long-time Rare fans should immediately recognise the trio&#x27;s contributions to the studio&#x27;s beloved back catalogue; Wise, for instance, was responsible for many memorable tracks in the Donkey Kong Country series (and provided the sublime score for Nintendo&#x27;s Tropical Freeze), more recently composing music for Sumo Digital&#x27;s Snake Pass and Playtonic&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee.


Kirkhope&#x27;s impressive credits include Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, Viva Piñata, and more recently, Ubisoft&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids, and Bayliss has designed characters for the likes of Battletoads, Killer Instinct, Diddy Kong Racing, and Yooka-Laylee. He was famously also behind Donkey Kong&#x27;s redesign.

                              <span>Jens Andersson, lead designer on Starbreeze Studios&#x27; acclaimed shooters The Darkness and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, has joined Wolfenstein developer MachineGames to serve as design director on its highly anticipated Indiana Jones project.


The new Indiana Jones game was unveiled early last year, although details were limited. It was described as featuring an &quot;original story&quot; unconnected to the upcoming Indiana Jones 5, with Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard executive producing in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games.


Andersson, who also helped create Eurogamer favourite Yoku&#x27;s Island Express, announced he&#x27;d joined as design director on the &quot;very special&quot; Indiana Jones project in a statement shared on Twitter (thanks VGC), explaining, &quot;I&#x27;m so excited about what we are building, and the way we get to do it - featuring one of [the] most iconic characters ever.&quot;

                              <span>We already knew Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest was set to return next year, but organisers now have a date for diaries everywhere, with 2023&#x27;s live showcase set to air on 8th June. Things are a little bit different in 2023, however, and next year&#x27;s event marks the first time Summer Game Fest will be open to the public.


The show - which promises a mix of premieres, live gameplay demos, and announcements - will take place at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California, in front of a live audience of fans. Tickets go on sale in &quot;early&quot; 2023, but for those unable or uninterested in attending in-person, Summer Game Fest will also stream live on all major streaming platforms.


Summer Game Fest 2023 marks the event&#x27;s fourth year of operation, and, as is now customary, the live showcase will kickstart a season of smaller events and showcases from participating developers and publishers. Specifics will follow at a later date.

                              <span>Frictional Games, the studio behind masterful sci-fi horror Soma, has announced a new entry in its acclaimed Amnesia series. It&#x27;s called Amnesia: The Bunker and is heading to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2023.


The Bunker - which will be the fourth Amensia game, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and last year&#x27;s Rebirth - promises to be something a little bit different, favouring &quot;unscripted&quot; semi-open-world horror over its predecessors&#x27; more linear scares.


&quot;For the first time, players are equipped with high levels of freedom to impact gameplay, choosing their playstyle as they explore at will,&quot; Frictional explains in its announcement. &quot;With hardly any scripted events, and constant tension brought about by an ever-present threat, it is up to each player to finesse their approach to survival.&quot;

The EA developer announced that Season 5 for the game has entered pre-production, which goes beyond the obligatory four seasons of content it owed to Year 1 battle pass subscribers. 


&quot;Across our team continuing to focus on Battlefield 2042, we have a mix of veteran developers alongside those working on their first game breathing in new life,&quot; DICE states in its latest blog post.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s one universal truth about Call of Duty players, it&#x27;s that they will spend as much money as needed to get even the slightest advantage over their peers. They would rather rage quit than be embarrassed by death.


So when Activision releases a premium skin bundle that makes it as difficult as possible for you to been seen by opponents, players will buy it in droves.


A new operator skin designed by Call of Duty eSports team LA Thieves puts players in an all-black outfit, allowing them to hide in shadows for some poor soul to pass by.

There are also five premade games to give you inspiration, and you use them as a template to edit from (or you can just play them if you&#x27;re not feeling creative).

Redditor Top_Scientist4578 datamined the item which will be available to purchase from Buy Stations around Al-Mazrah (the map which DMZ and Warzone is based in). 


Based on the screenshot, the item will cost $2000 in-game to purchase, although that&#x27;s probably a placeholder value.

                              <span>Capcom will hold a second Street Fighter 6 closed beta later this month, from 16th to 19th December. 


Tweaks to the game since its first round of testing include a fresh option on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S to &quot;reduce input delay&quot; as a setting in the game&#x27;s Graphics menu, which will &quot;shorten the gap between your inputs and the action happening on-screen&quot;.


Alternatively, on PC, you can toggle your Vsync setting off. The trade-off here is that this may increase the likelihood of screen-tearing, Capcom warns.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard has shed more light on Amazon&#x27;s upcoming Fallout adaptation.


Speaking on Lex Fridman&#x27;s podcast, the show&#x27;s executive producer stated that the upcoming series is &quot;not a retelling of a game story&quot;. Rather, it will take place on a separate area of the world&#x27;s map.



&quot;Let&#x27;s tell a story here that fits in the world that we have built, doesn&#x27;t break any of the rules, can reference things in the games, but isn&#x27;t a retelling of the games,&quot; Howard elaborated.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s final update for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is now available - a little earlier than expected! - and contains one last serving of story for those looking to see off heroine Eivor in style. 


There are still a few surprises left in store, however - as spotted by Destiny dataminer MAK Moderator - including armour sets themed around Destiny and Monster Hunter characters. 


Destiny&#x27;s Crucible boss Lord Shaxx and Saint-14 will both see their armour sets recreated in Valhalla. There&#x27;s also an armour set designed to look like Monster Hunter&#x27;s Odogaron.

As a result of the classification, speculation is growing that the release date of Final Fantasy 16 may be revealed soon.


What&#x27;s more, producer Naoki Yoshida is set to appear at The Game Awards next week with a &quot;very special live presentation&quot;.

Stitch will be the third new character included in the free update, after Toy Story&#x27;s Woody and Buzz, as the popular Disney Pixar live service life simulation continues to grow in size. 


The update will also add winter outfits for your character and for NPCs (Merlin will dress up as Santa), the ability to build snowmen (how very Frozen), set up campfires and cook marshmallows.

The Game Pass Twitter handle began its own version of a hangman-like teaser a couple of days ago, merely saying it was a fun little guessing game being shared for &quot;no reason in particular&quot;. 


We were then all told that there were three words to guess, each consisting of four letters, and the second letter of the last word was an A.

When speaking about observability in the cloud native space, then probably
everyone will mention OpenTelemetry (OTEL) at some point in the
conversation. That&#x27;s great, because the community needs standards to rely on
for developing all cluster components into the same direction. OpenTelemetry
enables us to combine logs, metrics, traces and other contextual information
(called baggage) into a single resource. Cluster administrators or software
engineers can use this resource to get a viewport about what is going on in the
cluster over a defined period of time. But how can Kubernetes itself make use of
this technology stack?
Kubernetes consists of multiple components where some are independent and others
are stacked together. Looking at the architecture from a containe…</span>

Due to open &quot;midway through&quot; 2023, the officially licensed Uncharted ride is a &quot;multi-dimensional&quot; dark ride coaster that&#x27;ll take riders on an &quot;immersive and exciting&quot; adventure through &quot;unexplored territories&quot; in search of &quot;one of the greatest treasures never found&quot;.


Kicking off with a &quot;pre-show full of surprises&quot;, the rollercoaster itself will feature 700m of track reaching up to 12m in height, and incorporate five launches with up to 1G of acceleration.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s highly anticipated The Duviri Paradox expansion might be delayed, but today brings a little something new to tide players over until its arrival next year, courtesy of the survival-based Lua&#x27;s Prey update, available now on all platforms.


&quot;As The Void exposes ancient scars and long-forgotten secrets,&quot; developer Digital Extremes says of its latest update, &quot;something sinister rumbles on Lua as the Grineer descend upon these newly exposed halls seeking possible treasure, corrupted by its long-dormant Orokin Neural Sentry. Under the guidance of The Lotus, the Tenno embark on a mission to investigate this destroyed piece of Lua formerly used to monitor Void Conjunctions.&quot;


Lua&#x27;s Prey serves as a &quot;light prequel&quot; to The Duviri Paradox, adding two new story-based Conjunction Survival missions featuring thematic teasers for next year&#x27;s expansion. These can be located at two newly added Lua nodes - Yuvarium and Circulus - and challenge players to maintain Life Support in the usual way. The twist, though, is that a Thrax enemy will spawn after every successful Survival round, increasing Life Support depletion by 50% while it remains alive, and requiring players to summon their Necramechs in order to defeat it.

                              <span>Sega has unveiled a new post-launch content roadmap for Sonic Frontiers, promising the likes of new playable characters and story content across three free DLC updates throughout 2023.


There&#x27;s no estimated time of arrival for any of Sonic Frontier&#x27;s newly announced updates, but the first will introduce a juke box, photo mode, and a selection of new challenge modes. That&#x27;ll be followed by a second update celebrating Sonic&#x27;s birthday - and adding new Koco and a new open zone challenge - suggesting Sega&#x27;s aiming for a June-ish launch for this one.


Finally, there&#x27;s the biggie, with Sonic Frontiers&#x27; third free update of 2023 teasing new story content and playable characters. The artwork for Update 3 features Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, but it&#x27;s unclear if these are the new playable characters or just a placeholder design flourish.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise, the stellar latest entry in Capcom&#x27;s long-running creature-bopping series, will reportedly be making the jump to PlayStation and Xbox in January next year.


Rise initially launched as a Switch console exclusive last March, with a PC release arriving in January this year. Both versions then received the game&#x27;s major Sunbreak expansion in July.


And now it seems Monster Hunter Rise is ready to spread its Rathalos-sized wings once more, with prolific leaker Tom Henderson&#x27;s Insider Gaming reporting Capcom will bring the acclaimed title to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass on 20th January 2023.

                              <span>Twitch has implemented a new Shield Mode feature, allowing streamers to pre-set safety settings.


The feature offers customisable controls that can be activated in one click, including channel modes (such as follower or sub only chat), chat verification options, and AutoMod levels.


This is a much requested feature, especially in the wake of last summer&#x27;s hate raids against streamers from minority communities, which remain ongoing.

                              <span>Amazon has revealed the next batch of titles being made available to Prime subscribers as part of December&#x27;s Prime Gaming line-up, which this time includes classic FPS Quake and the wonderful Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.


id Software&#x27;s Quake is, of course, a stone-cold classic, serving up a seminal slice of FPS action that - somewhat unbelievably - celebrated its 25th anniversary last year.


Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons mightn&#x27;t be quite as well-known, but its story of two siblings on an increasingly fantastical quest to find a cure for their father&#x27;s mysterious affliction is an absolute delight, and a game I find myself returning to every couple of years. The gist is players must overcome its various platform and puzzle challenges by controlling both brothers simulataneously, but it&#x27;s also gained a proper two-player co-op mode over the years.

Surprise! Or not. The angry green giant was previously spotted by fans in the background of an earlier trailer - leaving his inclusion somewhat a foregone conclusion.

                              <span>Furry Hentai Tangram is a puzzle game where players must slot shapes into a grid to reveal lewd anime pictures underneath. It&#x27;s also available on the Nintendo Switch eShop priced £2.39 (currently reduced from £2.99). 


The fact this game, which launched last Friday, is available on the notoriously family-friendly Nintendo Switch has raised eyebrows among users uncomfortable with their kids finding its store page on the Nintendo eShop. 


&quot;Seriously Nintendo... this is my eight year old cousin&#x27;s account,&quot; wrote one fan on reddit, sharing a screenshot of the game - visible from Furry Hentai Tangram&#x27;s store page - depicting a mostly-undressed character with cat ears.

There&#x27;s a lot of emotional beats in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. And fans have noticed how empty it feels when the cutscenes have no voice acting, but could really benefit from some.
A group of Pokémon fans, who are also voice actors, have come together to dub over some of the game&#x27;s cutscenes to imagine what the game would be like with voice-over.

                              <span>Well, this is a nice surprise. Not only is the final content update for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla now live on all platforms - a week earlier than planned! - but it includes a surprise tie-in to next year&#x27;s Bagdhad-based Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage. 


We were expecting this last chapter of Eivor&#x27;s story to arrive next week, on 6th December. Announcing its early release last night, Ubisoft blamed &quot;an unforeseen glitch in the Animus&quot;. 


As expected, this final dollop of Valhalla storyline sees Eivor wrap up her time in England and head off to North America one last time - where the game&#x27;s opening shows she is buried. There&#x27;s time for a few final goodbyes with some noteworthy people from Valhalla&#x27;s long campaign, and then it&#x27;s off to find out more about what Odin has been up to.

                              <span>Nintendo has now released its second trailer for the Super Mario Bros. Movie, giving us our best look yet at the upcoming animated film from Minions maker Illumination. 


The trailer showcases a good look at the film&#x27;s version of Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Tayor-Joy) while Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario only gets a couple of lines of dialogue. Overall, it&#x27;s a fun glimpse at some familiar Mario locales and characters, translated for the big screen. 


If you&#x27;re a Nintendo nerd like me, you&#x27;ve probably rewatched the trailer more than once to spot everything going on in the background. And there&#x27;s some cool Easter eggs - particularly if you like the extended Donkey Kong family. Let&#x27;s give it one more watch and dive in.

                              <span>More glitches have been discovered in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (who would have thunk it) which allow players to duplicate items, and even their legendary Pokémon.
Plenty of bugs and exploits have already been found, whether it&#x27;s creating body horror or duplicating shiny Pokémon, but this is on a different level. In the game, you&#x27;re supposed to only have one of the legendaries, whether that&#x27;s Koraidon or Miraidon, but now you can fill up your boxes with them.
These new-found glitches have been widely discussed in the Pokémon community, and they&#x27;re not that difficult to pull off. One has been tested by yours truly, and I can confirm it works. The other requires you to have beaten the end-game, which I&#x27;ve not reached yet so I can&#x27;t confirm at the moment whether it works or not. Beware some spoilers ahead!

                              <span>Xbox Games with Gold still trundles on, and Microsoft has now confirmed December&#x27;s titles for Xbox Live members as Colt Canyon and Bladed Fury


Colt Canyon is described as an &quot;atmospheric and punchy&quot; rogue-like shooter set in a pixel-art Wild West, where players can root and toot their way toward saving their kidnapped partner from ruthless bandits. &quot;Take your gun and TNT,&quot; explains developer Retrific, &quot;and shoot your way through a hostile canyon full of hidden treasures, weapons, obstacles and all kinds of bloodthirsty scum.&quot;


Eurogamer hasn&#x27;t scanned a critical eye over Colt Canyon, but with a Very Positive rating over on Steam, the masses appear to think this one is pretty good!

                              <span>After a solid first showing for the long-awaited Super Mario Bros. Movie in October, Nintendo has returned with a second action-packed trailer, this time giving us a first proper look at Peach, Donkey Kong, and a delightful karting cameo for Rainbow Road.


In fact, it&#x27;s a bit of a treat for Mario fans all-round, casting its net wide to introduce a host of familiar faces, places, and power-ups, all given a vibrant movie makeover. It&#x27;s the first time we get to hear Anya Taylor-Joy&#x27;s no-nonsense Princess Peach, for instance, as well as Charlie Day as Luigi, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong, even though the latter&#x27;s debut was mainly just a grunt.


Elsewhere, the trailer delivers a breakneck tour of the movie&#x27;s beautifully reimagined Mushroom Kingdom, giving us a stroll across a bridge amid of flurry of Cheep Cheeps, a glimpse inside Peach&#x27;s castle, and, of course, the crowd-pleasing addition of karts hurtling across Rainbow Road.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR - developer Supermassive Games&#x27; rail-shooter spin on its acclaimed narrative horror series - has been confirmed as a launch day title for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation VR 2, meaning it&#x27;ll arrive on 22nd February next year.


Switchback isn&#x27;t Supermassive&#x27;s first foray into spooky VR, of course; it previously adapted its cinematic horror game Until Dawn into both a VR prequel and a gaudy, rollercoaster-like rail shooter called Rush of Blood. And Dark Pictures: Switchback VR is very much a spiritual successor to the latter, sending players on a &quot;nightmarish and horrifying&quot; branching VR thrill ride through scenes that should be familiar to Dark Pictures fans.


&quot;Survive the Ghost Ship and its distorted apparitions,&quot; Supermassive teases, &quot;confront hideous demonic incarnations of persecuted &#x27;witches&#x27;. Fight for your life against other-worldly vampires and escape the horrifying World&#x27;s Fair Hotel&#x27;s sadistic serial killer.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft has unveiled Lost Between Worlds, a new expansion for Far Cry 6 that&#x27;ll whisk players away to a fractured alien version of Yara when it launches on 6th December.


Lost Between Worlds&#x27; surreal extraterrestrial action begins when Far Cry 6 protagonist Dani Rojas inadvertently stumbles across a crashed alien ship inhabited by an alein AI known as FAI. Unfortunately for Dani, FAI immediately seals the surrounding area and demands they embark on a quest to retrieve five crystals needed to repair their ship - each one hidden away in a mysterious rift containing a fractured simulation of Yara.


There are familiar locations twisted into a surreal architectural kaleidoscope, others plunged deep underwater, and still others ravaged by endless lightning storms. Every rift features multiple routes via orange and purple portals, and players will need to use their combat, parkour, and puzzle skills to pick their way through and retrieve the crystal housed in each one.

Tournaments for PlayStation 5 is an updated version of the feature first seen on PS4 back in 2016, giving players an on-console means of competing against other players to win prizes across the likes of PlayStation events, challenges, and leaderboard competitions.


Sony says the new PlayStation 5 version of Tournaments &quot;streamlines&quot; the competitive player experience, offering easily discoverable tournaments, seamless on-console sign-up, shorter tournament times, plus automatic and real-time match updates - all delivered though a new UI, featuring the likes of notifications.

The report, published by Newcastle and Loughborough Universities, tracked the gaming habits of 42 families with children aged between five and 17, and interviewed another 30 parents, carers and video game designers.


In short, the study found children struggled to track spending in video games where &quot;highly alluring&quot; digital items were advertised to them using techniques borrowed from regulated gambling.

Wilkie first stated his intention to introduce the Classication Amendment (Loot Boxes) Bill last year (via Kotaku Australia). Back then, he wanted any games with loot boxes to be given a R18+ rating, and a new &quot;advisory&quot; classification to highlight their presence.
The bill was filed yesterday by Wilkie, and the details of it can be viewed on the Australian government&#x27;s website.

As you&#x27;d expect from its name, this version adds ray-tracing, Nvidia DLSS 3, &quot;hand-crafted hi-res physically-based textures&quot; and &quot;enhanced high-poly models evocative of the originals&quot;. Here&#x27;s how it looks in action, compared to the original:

                              <span>There are many things that come to mind when thinking about the Grand Theft Auto series. The characters, the settings, the weapons and cars, an awful lot of chaos - I could go on.


However, one image that probably isn&#x27;t immediately conjured up in your head when thinking about Rockstar&#x27;s long-standing franchise is a whopping great big dinosaur rampaging the streets. And yet, this is actually the sort of game Grand Theft Auto started life off as. 


Speaking to the BBC alongside the series&#x27; 25th anniversary, developer Colin Macdonald revealed &quot;GTA went through a lot of different iterations and [had] quite a troubled development&quot;, stating the first game &quot;wasn&#x27;t really regarded well for most of the time it was in production.&quot;

                              <span>Bohemia Interactive, developer of military simulation game Arma 3, has asked fans to watch out for edited in-game videos being shared around social media that are falsely labelled as real-world war footage.


Specifically, Bohemia has called for players and content creators to &quot;use their game footage responsibly&quot;, &quot;refrain from using clickbait video titles&quot; and &quot;always state clearly that the video originated from a video game&quot; rather than footage from a real-life conflict.


Arma 3 gameplay videos have a history of being mistaken for real-world footage - even by professional news organisations - and this problem has only increased since the current conflict in Ukraine has begun, Bohemia said.

As promised, Warzone has been quietly relaunched as Caldera, albeit on life support, as Ishraq put it earlier.

Known as Mocopi, this set will enable mobile motion capture, thanks to sensors worn around a user&#x27;s head, waist, wrists and ankles. When paired with the compatible smartphone app, these trackers can then be used to animate an avatar within said app. 


In addition to adding your avatar to real-world locations, users will also be able to combine avatars and background images within the app. Meanwhile, it will also use VRChat as a motion input device. You can see just how Mocopi looks in action via the trailer below.

It&#x27;s the first detailed description we&#x27;ve had of the remake, and suggests a more from-the-ground-up reworking of the original role-player than previously thought. 


Thanks to the success of The Witcher 3, the series is now thought of as a fully open-world franchise. But that was not the case back in the original Witcher game, which featured a number of separate large maps and various smaller areas.

Inspired by Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s cult-classic 1997 movie, Starship Troopers: Extermination drops up to three squads of four players onto the front lines amid an Arachnid assault, challenging them to work together to complete objectives, acquire resources, build and defend their base of operations, and finally escape to the extraction zone.


There are three classes to choose from - Assault, Support, and Defense, each with their own weapons, equipment, and perks - alongside a base building system that sees players using resources acquired from planetside refineries to construct walls, towers, ammo stations, and various other amenities in an effort to gain the upper hand in battle.

                              <span>Having given us all time to recover from the surprise the upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie actually looks pretty good, Nintendo has announced it&#x27;s ready for round two, with a second trailer airing tomorrow in a new Nintendo Direct.


Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures&#x27; Illumination animation division, and sees Chris Pratt, in the role of Mario, heading an all-star cast including Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.


We got a promising first glimpse of the Mario movie back in October, with its debut trailer managing to look the part and land a few successful visual gags - with Jack Black and Keegan-Michael Key, who plays Toad, clearly having a blast in their roles.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s much-delayed The Settlers reboot has resurfaced once more, bringing with it a new name - it&#x27;ll now be known as The Settlers: New Allies - and a 17th February 2023 release date on PC, with console versions to follow.


This latest release date marks Ubisoft&#x27;s fourth attempt at getting its Settlers reboot out the door; when the publisher first revealed it was revisiting the series&#x27; much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula back in 2018, the reboot was expected to arrive in autumn the following year. That wasn&#x27;t to be, though, and the game was first pushed into 2020 before being postponed indefinitely as summer 2020 rolled around.


It seemed like the end was finally in sight for patient The Settlers fans at the start of this year, however, when Ubisoft announced a new 17th March release date for its reboot - but, following less-than-stellar closed beta feedback, the publisher slammed on the breaks once more, only saying the game would instead launch at &quot;a later date&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly readying to make a number of formal concessions to EU regulators investigating its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, including the guarantee Call of Duty will be availalble on PlayStation for the next ten years.


Call of Duty has remained a focal point during government scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard deal, with regulators - including those in the UK and Europe - raising fears Microsoft may leverage the juggernaut franchise to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.


Reports in September revealed Microsoft had initially pledged to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for &quot;at least several more years&quot; beyond Activision&#x27;s existing deal - an arrangement PlayStation boss Jim Ryan would go on to call &quot;inadequate on many levels&quot; - but as regulatory scrutiny deepened, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said the company would continue releasing Call of Duty on Sony&#x27;s consoles for &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to&quot;.

                              <span>Pokémon Go has revealed details of its ninth season, Mythical Wishes, which will carry the game through the next three months: from 1st December to 1st March. 


Mythical Wishes is a reference to Hoenn&#x27;s Mythical creature Jirachi, which has only appeared in Pokémon Go once previously. It looks set for a reappearance (and possible Shiny debut?) at 2023&#x27;s Pokémon Go Tour event, which is set to be detailed fully tomorrow. More tangibly, today&#x27;s new trailer also teases the release of Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre at the end - some of the most powerful creatures in the series, and a big deal for fans.


Hoenn creatures dominate much of the next season, with the introduction of the region&#x27;s three Starter creatures in their Mega evolved forms: Mega Sceptile, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Swampert. The trio will debut via a Raid Day event this Saturday, 3rd December which will offer a number of extra free raid passes.

                              <span>Three years after it released on PC, Red Dead Redemption 2 broke its all-time peak of concurrent players yesterday.
Single-player DLC for the game looks unlikely, and the bundled multiplayer offering Red Dead Online was pronounced &quot;dead&quot; by its community of players after developer Rockstar confirmed it would no longer push major updates to the game to shift development to Grand Theft Auto 6 instead.
That hasn&#x27;t put people off enjoying Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, however (with some help from the Thanksgiving holidays across the pond and Steam&#x27;s autumn sale).

The brainchild of the UK-based startup Joipaw, the Joipaw Console will come with a &quot;dog-tailored touchscreen, a height-adjustable stand and an automated treat dispenser.&quot; It will run interactive puzzle games, such as a whack-a-mole challenge, that are &quot;constantly new and challenging&quot; for man&#x27;s best friend (thanks, Axios).


&quot;Add speakers, a microphone and a Full HD camera, and you have the smartest dog tech product to ever hit the market,&quot; Joipaw proclaims on the console&#x27;s reservation page.

YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming interviewed ex-Nintendo programmer Giles Goddard, who now runs his own studio (Chuhai Labs - Cursed to Golf, Carve Snowboarding). Previously he worked on Super Mario 64, Star Fox, and 1080 Snowboarding.


In 2021, Goddard hosted a reddit AMA where he admitted F-Zero was his favourite game on the SNES and that his studio had created an F-Zero prototype with ultra-realistic physics that was never released. DidYouKnowGaming dug deeper.

                              <span>Activision was kept busy over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend fixing a popular Call of Duty glitch which granted infinite money and weapon XP. 


The now-fixed exploit let you repeatedly sell weapons at the game&#x27;s Buy Stations in exchange for XP. In a quick fix for the issue, XP from Buy Stations was nerfed to counter the number of people quickly levelling up their weapons. 


But, as fans quickly found, this still left the game&#x27;s white dumpster Dead Drops as an option. This lasted another half day or so, until it too was countered by another behind the scenes change.

The horror franchise&#x27;s first two titles - Man of Medan and Little Hope - were updated on 28th September with a spruce-up designed to introduce difficulty settings, QTE warnings and more accessibility options. Man of Medan even gained a &quot;previously unseen&quot; story chapter. 


But these updates also had the unintended consequence of introducing a raft of bugs to the games, with a number of players complaining of being unable to save or make progress past certain points.

After all, Joel Miller from Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us series is easily recognisable, with his full head of hair and slightly scruffy facial furniture. 


However, it turns out that if you remove all of his hair (bar his eyebrows, thank goodness), he looks really quite different... and I am not sure that is a good thing.


As shared by prolific modder Speclizer, who recently unlocked God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s unfinished photo mode, there is now a The Last of Us Part 2 mod that makes Joel&#x27;s head and face almost as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.

As shared on reddit, user Lord-Trolldemort noticed that the accuracy of certain moves was rigged.


And as the Battle Stadium is the game&#x27;s ranked online mode, this could have serious implications.

In what was presumably an oversight from the developers at Game Freak - and not intentional - fans have found you can align your character and Meowscarada just a little too well, allowing for a kiss-like interaction when out picnicking.
Why would you want to kiss Meowscarada? Well, when its design leaked shortly before launch, people quickly made hordes of fan art, some of which was not particularly wholesome or Safe For Work.

                              <span>Details of Fortnite&#x27;s upcoming Chapter 3 ending have leaked online, days ahead of the game&#x27;s Fracture live event - scheduled for this Saturday, 3rd December at 9pm UK time.


The leak contains audio files including dialogue, as well as assets and artwork, and appears to have come from someone able to bypass Epic Games&#x27; own in-game encryption for these files. 


Eurogamer will not be spoiling any details of the event itself ahead of time.

                              <span>A Pokémon fan is creating a 60fps mod for Scarlet and Violet that significantly boosts performance.


The mod, created by theboy181, is not yet complete or publicly available, but videos have been posted on Twitter showing the smoother frame rate.


Of course, this is all happening on a PC emulator rather than the Switch directly.

                              <span>Following his appointment as co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios alongside Peter Safran, filmmaker James Gunn has confirmed that future DC video games will indeed be part of a larger connected universe for the Warner Bros. franchise. 
 
In a back and forth on Twitter, Gunn stated the &quot;DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).&quot; When asked further if this statement also included games, Gunn replied with a simple and clear &quot;yes&quot;.
This news is not surprising. Earlier reports revealed that Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav had spoken to the wider company about plans to &quot;build a bible for a cohesive DC universe&quot; that would include media such as &quot;live-action films, TV, animation, gaming and more&quot;.

Researchers at University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, recovered logs from laptops after receiving overnight repairs from 12 commercial shops. The logs showed that technicians from six of the locations had accessed personal data and that two of those shops also copied data onto a personal device. Devices belonging to females were more likely to be snooped on, and that snooping tended to seek more sensitive data, including both sexually revealing and non-sexual pictures, documents, and financial information...</span>

Starting with Kubernetes 1.25, our container image registry has changed from k8s.gcr.io to registry.k8s.io. This new registry spreads the load across multiple Cloud Providers &amp; Regions, functioning as a sort of content delivery network (CDN) for Kubernetes container images. This change reduces the project’s reliance on a single entity and provides a faster download experience for a large number of users.
TL;DR: What you need to know about this change
Container images for Kubernetes releases from 1.25 onward are no longer published to k8s.gcr.io, only to registry.k8s.io.
In the upcoming December patch releases, the new registry domain default will be backported to all branches still in support (1.22, 1.23, 1.24).

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers&#x27; 1.10 update is about to be deployed, seemingly starting with PlayStation consoles.

The update primarily hopes to address bugs and issues with the game, as well as provide some additional - if unspecified - quality-of-life improvements for players.

Whilst the game&#x27;s English-language social media channels have yet to publicise the patch, the blue blur&#x27;s Japanese counterpart has, revealing that the update is now ready for PS4 and PS5 now and will be available for other platforms &quot;in the near future&quot;.

In a &quot;special message from Firaxis&quot; posted to YouTube, the team outlined their favourite aspects of the upcoming tactical role playing game, and it included confirmation that there&#x27;ll be a lot of cut-scenes and conversations as you foster relationships with your teammates.

&quot;I think we ended up with something like 65,000 lines of voiced dialogue, over two hours of cinematics, and, gosh, more branching choices than you could imagine,&quot; lead engineer Will Miller said in the interview (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Gran Turismo creator Kazunori Yamauchi has revealed that Sony is &quot;considering&quot; porting the racing series to PC.

In an interview with GTPlanet (thanks, VGC), Yamauchi was asked if he would &quot;consider&quot; following the recent trends set by Sony first-party titles like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Death Stranding by taking the latest instalment, Gran Turismo 7, to PC.

&quot;Yes, I do think so,&quot; Yamauchi responded when asked if Polyphony Digital could do the same.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol has turned to many things for inspiration, including some of horror&#x27;s most terrifying movies like Alien and Event Horizon, but here&#x27;s one that may come as a bit of a surprise: SpongeBob SquarePants.

No, I&#x27;m not talking about the (also horrifying) Rock Bottom episode where SpongeBob gets stuck in Glove World; it turns out that the way animated characters move have inspired the character director of The Callisto Protocol, too.

“Some creatures came from the art perspective, though, like, &#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s just do something that is very crazy looking&#x27;. And then we put that in the game and find a way of making it work,&quot; character director Glauco Longhi told  GLHF, via The Sun.

Whilst the number includes players who are idle - that is, signed in but not actively playing anything - Steam&#x27;s own analytics show that a new peak of 31,349,780 concurrent players was set over the weekend. 

As is often the case, third-party tracker SteamDB boasts a slightly different number - a higher figure of 31,379,760 concurrent players - 9.3 of whom were actively online and gaming at the time the record was set.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 has been rated in South Korea. 

As spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at Resetera, the fighting game - which, as yet, does not have a firm release date beyond a very vague &quot;2023&quot; window - has secured a 15 age rating due to its &quot;expression of physical damage shown in illustrations in addition to basic fighting expression&quot;.

Whilst this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that a release is just around the corner, it does intimate that it&#x27;s probably set to drop in the next six months or so… and with The Game Awards just a few days away now, many fans are speculating that we may get that all-important release date then. Watch this space, eh?

That&#x27;s according to Ubisoft&#x27;s own social media posts, which revealed that on 6pm UK time on 29th November (that&#x27;s 10am PT), the team will broadcast a &quot;reveal livestream&quot; about the upcoming expansion on its official Twitch channel.

Whilst the developer stopped short of revealing what, exactly, the new content includes, we do get a brief little teaser that includes hints about Fortnite-like crystals and portals. Here, take a peek:

                              <span>Whilst Warzone 2.0 isn&#x27;t without its fair share of irritants, including wallbackers and aimbotters, even I can&#x27;t help but laugh at the latest hack currently plaguing Al Mazrah: flying boats.

That&#x27;s right; some players have discovered how to make boats fly, elevating them high into the air to avoid the battlefield entirely and coast to victory. Here&#x27;s one in action: 

It&#x27;s also perhaps the one good thing I&#x27;ve seen come from proximity chat so far, too; rather than eliminate their enemies, the hackers are using the chat feature to invite randoms into their ship where they sail across the sky instead of the clear blue waters, like this example below (thanks, PC Gamer):

The &quot;Townscaper-esque&quot; app - well, it&#x27;s more of a PC mod, really - is &quot;simple, focussed, and made purposefully for No Man&#x27;s Sky&quot; so players can create, edit, and improve their base building with &quot;fun ways to move, snap, and color base parts&quot;.

And it comes with the greatest of great endorsements from Hello Games&#x27; own Sean Murray (thanks, PC Gamer):

                              <span>Several videos purportedly featuring footage from the as yet unreleased Need for Speed Unbound have leaked online.

The footage - uploaded by MrCarrot1890 and Lvneth on YouTube and spotted by the fine folks at Resetera - currently consists of numerous videos that culminate in about an hour of gameplay. It predates not only the 2nd December release date but also the early access period,too,  which is supposed to go live on 29th November.

Interestingly, it doesn&#x27;t look like the YouTube accounts in question took the footage themselves, as two of the videos were recorded from a Twitch livestream broadcast by someone called gerrykurlsucks, and another from a content creator called Chocolove95.

Acknowledging that &quot;part of the success&quot; of the sequel &quot;undeniably goes to the game’s remarkable score&quot;, the team held an &quot;exceptional concert for the occasion of the game’s release&quot; which is now available on YouTube.

&quot;A Plague Tale: Requiem, the spectacular, grounded medieval adventure within a violent fantasy world, has been nominated in no less than five categories for The Game Awards 2022, including the coveted Game of the Year award!&quot; the team explains. &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled by this exciting chance, which confirms the overwhelmingly positive reception of the game.

Confirmation came via Dealabs leaker billbil-kun who - as well as confirming that Star Wars: Squadrons is currently free to add to your Epic Games Store library from now until next Thursday, 1st December - dropped a hint that the Epic Games Store will once again be running its &quot;Advent Calendar&quot; event.

&quot;Do you know if we&#x27;ll have an advent calendar again in December? (1 set per day)&quot;, asked a curious poster, to which billbil-kun replied: &quot;Yes, somewhere between December 15, 2022 and January 10, 2023,&quot; (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>Following yet another delay for its exceedingly long-in-the-works Dead Island 2, publisher Quick Silver has announced the zombie shooter sequel will be getting its first proper airing in quite some time on Tuesday, 6th December.


Dead Island 2 was, somewhat unbelievably, initially unveiled all the way back in 2014, promising more of the kind of co-operative zombie shooting action that had made developer Techland&#x27;s enjoyable 2011 original a bit of a hit.


Since then, though, development has been turbulent, with the sequel missing its initially announcement 2015 release date and losing its original developer - Spec Ops: The Line studio Yager - that same year. Eight months later, British developer Sumo Digital was revealed to have taken over the project, but another studio switch was still to come when Homefront: The Revolution maker Dambuster Studios took the reins in 2019.

In August, Sifu received a beefy content update, which featured a new scoring system and modifiers which allowed players to customise the difficulty. Two new outfits were also added, and Slocap teased more to come in the autumn update.
Included in the roadmap for Sifu in the autumn update is the replay editor and additional modifiers. Slocap shared a brief look at the replay editor on the official Twitter account for Sifu.

The team behind Tamriel Rebuilt has been releasing content for Morrowind since 2002, though its conception happened in 2001 before Morrowind was released.

21 years later, the project is still going strong. In its first update in nearly two years, the project has added two more expansions with new areas of Tamriel to explore (thanks PC Gamer).

Robertson became somewhat of an internet darling following her portrayal of the towering and beguiling Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village. She won legions of fans for her part in Capcom&#x27;s long running series, and even won a few awards for it too.


Needless to say, dear reader, I am one of those fans, and since hearing she was a part of God of War Ragnarök, I have been eager to find her character in the game.

                              <span>Hinterland Studio&#x27;s superb snowy survival adventure The Long Dark is getting its first paid expansion on 5th December and, ahead of release, the developer has detailed all it&#x27;ll bring.


Tales from the Far Territory, as the new expansion is known, releases in six parts over the course of 12 months, each arriving approximately every 8-10 weeks. All six parts will focus on The Long Dark&#x27;s much-loved Survival mode, but there are narrative elements in there and Hinterland is referring to the complete series as a &quot;campaign&quot;.


Exactly what will be coming when is currently unclear, but Hinterland has now detailed all the major features it&#x27;ll be introducing to Survival mode throughout the expansion. There are three new areas, for instance - the Forsaken Airfield, Industrial Mine, and Mountain Pass - all accessible via the Far Range Branchline and Transfer Pass hub.

                              <span>It&#x27;s barely been a week since American Truck Simulator thundered across the Texan border, but already SCS Software is setting course for a new destination, with the developer having now confirmed Oklahoma as the trucking sim&#x27;s next DLC expansion.


Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 12th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and its announcement isn&#x27;t all that unexpected given SCS&#x27; continued left-to-right march across the US, and Oklahoma slotting so neatly above the recently released Texas.


&quot;While Oklahoma tends to have an unfortunate reputation of being a rather arid place,&quot; SCS writes in its announcement post, &quot;sometimes it&#x27;s much better to avoid judging a book by its cover. The state is home to wonderful national parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends. And if you are looking for something more practical instead, the local road network and a strong economy will keep every trucker properly busy.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s fair to say Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have caused their share of complaints. Now, fans are upset that a Pokémon is too good. 


Fire starter Fuecoco has been branded as &quot;broken&quot; by proponents of Pokémon&#x27;s &quot;Nuzlocke&quot; style of gameplay - the fan-invented method of playing Pokémon which essentially amounts to permadeath. 


Any Pokémon which faints in a Nuzlocke run is considered dead and must be released back into the wild. Additionally, you may only catch the first creature in any area and no other, severely limiting the number of Pokémon at your disposal.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red will deploy its long-awaited next-gen update for The Witcher 3 on 14th December, and with it bring new Performance and Quality modes, a new Photo Mode, and other such quality of life features to the game.


However, it will also bring along with it something that is, perhaps, not quite so welcome. 


Why yes, Witcher fans, this next-gen update will also include Netflix&#x27;s take (at least for its first season) on the Nilfgaardian army&#x27;s armour.

                              <span>As the World Cup kicks off, video game publishers have of course devised strategies to cash-in on the hype. EA has an officially licenced World Cup mode in FIFA 23, while Epic has some not-so-official World Cup skins in Fortnite.   


Activision falls under the latter category with what is possibly the most creative (or bizarre) tie-in I have ever seen. 


In Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2/Warzone 2.0, players can now vote on which team they think will win future matches. Those who guess correctly get 10,000 XP, that national team&#x27;s flag as a Calling Card, oh and a remix of their national anthem.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing the PlayStation 6 - specifically, Sony&#x27;s concerns about Call of Duty not being available on the upcoming platform, which we now know will debut sometime from 2027 onwards. 

It&#x27;s been another week dominated by news of Microsoft&#x27;s $68bn Activision Blizzard takeover attempt, which is currently being scrutinised by the UK&#x27;s anti-competition regulator. Partially-redacted documentation from this process has now been made public, revealing some eyebrow-raising arguments from Sony - which is trying to block the deal. 
Both Sony and Microsoft have gone on the defensive to make themselves look the smaller fish - with Microsoft  admitting Sony&#x27;s exclusives are better and Sony saying any loss of Call of Duty would leave itself &quot;extremely vulnerable&quot;, particularly if the series was made available through the popular Xbox Game Pass. So, should Sony be worried - or is this all just performative theatrics? Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

Ghost&#x27;s face has been one of Call of Duty&#x27;s biggest mysteries since his introduction. Just who is it that hides behind that slightly unnerving facial covering? 


Well, this mystery is a mystery no more, as Ghost has - quite literally - been unmasked by Redditor Crafty-Astronomer905 (thanks PCGamesN).

The M13B Assault Rifle is contentiously locked behind a challenge in Warzone&#x27;s DMZ mode and is a massive pain in the bottom to complete. 


However, players have also found a neat trick that means that only one person in your group of friends has to complete the challenge. That player can then &quot;drop&quot; the weapon for other members of the squad to pick up, extract, and unlock.

                              <span>Fresh details of the legal battle between Disco Elyisum creatives and their former bosses have emerged, as part of a hearing held in an Estonian court. 


To recap on the story so far: a trio of high profile staff behind the first Disco Elysium game were fired from developer ZA/UM following the company&#x27;s takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus, who is now ZA/UM&#x27;s boss and controlling shareholder, and Tõnis Haavel who was previously convicted of investment fraud. 


On the one side, some of the staff - including Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - have previously alleged that Kompus and Haavel&#x27;s takeover was fraudulent, and that they were booted out when trying to discover more. On the other, Kompus and Haavel have claimed the firings were due to some staff creating a &quot;toxic environment&quot; - and they were allegedly planning to depart the studio anyway to try and build a Disco Elysium sequel elsewhere.

                              <span>EA has apologised after the Need for Speed Twitter account branded a fan as a &quot;milkshake brain&quot;.


The exchange followed news that players who pre-order the forthcoming Need for Speed Unbound: Palace Edition will receive three days of early access ahead of release.


One particular fan criticised this, which began an argument in which the official account called the fan &quot;milkshake brain&quot; and told them to &quot;cry about it bro or buy regular price idc&quot;.

But while Soap is certainly a key part of the series, there are still some aspects of his persona that are left untold. Well, this list of unknown attributes just got a little shorter, thanks to his Modern Warfare 2 bio.


Here, it is revealed that Soap got his nickname not because he is fastidious in the shower, but because he is good at &quot;cleaning house&quot;. In fact, this is something he does with &quot;remarkable speed and accuracy in room clearance techniques and urban warfare tactics&quot;.

                              <span>UPDATE 3pm UK time: Activision Blizzard exec Lulu Cheng Meservey has hit back at yesterday&#x27;s report which suggested the FTC will &quot;fight&quot; to challenge Microsoft&#x27;s deal.


Making a statement on Twitter, Meservey said any notion the deal would be anticompetitive is &quot;absurd&quot; and that the &quot;merger will benefit gamers and the US gaming industry - especially as we face stiffer competition from abroad&quot;.


This could be referring to moves made by Sweden&#x27;s Embracer Group and China&#x27;s Tencent to acquire more studios and IPs.

                              <span>Sony has dunked on EA&#x27;s Battlefield series in its arguments against Microsoft&#x27;s buyout of Activision Blizzard.


In documents released as part of the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority review into the potential merger, Sony argues that Call of Duty &quot;is not replicable&quot; and that other games cannot compete with its success.



It then calls out the Battlefield series as a major rival, but says the franchise &quot;cannot keep up&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed Pokémon Violet and Scarlet sold over 10m copies in their first three days of release, making it the company&#x27;s biggest ever launch in that time period.


Pokémon Violet and Scarlet have faced significant criticism since release - Digital Foundry called the games &quot;comprehensive technical failures&quot; - but that hasn&#x27;t stopped them from smashing previous series entries&#x27; already considerable launch day records.


We already knew Violet and Scarlet were off to a flying start when charts firm GfK confirmed the pair were not only the UK&#x27;s biggest boxed video game launch of the year, but the UK&#x27;s second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time - only being beaten out by 3DS&#x27; Sun and Moon.

                              <span>Developer Striking Distance Studios has responded to the news its sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s season pass will feature exclusive death animations, insisting these haven&#x27;t been cut from the main game to sell for an additional fee.


As detailed on Steam, The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s season pass consists of four components: the Outer Way Skin Collection, story DLC, a Riot Bundle featuring a new wave-based mode set in an &quot;undiscovered area&quot; of Black Iron Prison, and a permadeath mode included in the Contagion Bundle. Eyebrows were raised, however, with the news the latter two bundles would also add a total of 25 new death animations - 13 for protagonist Jacob and 12 for enemies.


Much of The Callisto Protocol’s pre-release publicity has focused on its myriad gruesome death animations as a key selling point - Striking Distance&#x27;s CEO Glen Schofield discussed its &quot;gore engine&quot; with Eurogamer earlier this year - so there was a degree of incredulity when Striking Distance revealed more than two dozen of these would only be available to purchasers of the season pass, being sold as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition for an additional £20.

Splinter Cell&#x27;s audio adaptation - officially titled Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Firewall - follows series protagonist and Fourth Echelon agent Sam Fisher on a mission to recruit and train the next generation of operatives for the National Security Agency&#x27;s covert action division. &quot;When a lethal assassin from Fisher&#x27;s past returns from the dead on a mission of murder,&quot; the BBC teases, &quot;he is thrust into a race against time as a sinister threat to global security is revealed.&quot;


Firewall stars Andonis Anthony (The Archers) as Sam Fisher, and Daisy Head as his daughter Sarah. Other cast members include Sacha Dhawan (Doctor Who, The Great), Will Poulter (Midsommer, Black Mirror), and Nikesh Patel (Starstruck, The Devil&#x27;s Hour).

                              <span>CD Projekt&#x27;s long-promised next-gen update for The Witcher 3 is almost upon us, and ahead of its PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC arrival on 14th December, the studio has shared a first look at the various enhancements it&#x27;ll bring.


As far as technical improvements go, CD Projekt positively whistled through them during its first-look livestream, but PC players can expect to see support for the likes of raytracing, DLSS, and FSR, alongside a selection of new Ultra Plus graphics options, boosting background characters, level of detail, and more.


Indeed, there are visual touch-ups across the board, including a rework for grass and foliage, enhanced and more varied weather conditions, plus higher resolution textures and meshes throughout environments. Novigrad&#x27;s cobblestones are no longer normal maps, for instance, and instead now fully 3D. Keen-eyed players will also see the likes of smoke drifting from chimneys in distant villages.

                              <span>The issue of young people growing addicted to video games has been solved, China says.


The country&#x27;s top industry body made the announcement yesterday, Reuters reported, following the introduction of a draconian set of rules which restricted anyone in the country under the age of 18 from playing video games longer than three hours in any typical week.


This crackdown has achieved &quot;remarkable results&quot;, the China Game Industry Group Committee data provider CNG said, with more than 75 percent of all under-18s now claimed to be following the rules.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök is off to a flying start, having sold 5.1m copies in its first week - making it officially the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation title to date.


PlayStation Studios head Herman Hulst shared the news on Twitter, thanking fans and congratulating God of War Ragnarök developer Sony Santa Monica for its &quot;amazing achievement&quot;.


We already knew God of War Ragnarök was doing the numbers, of course - it set the day-one sales record for the franchise here in the UK - but Hulst&#x27;s announcement confirmed it had also set a first-week sales record for the series around the world. By way of comparison, Ragnarök&#x27;s immediate predecessor shifted 3.1m copies in its first three days back in 2018, beating out the previous record held by God of War 3 in 2010.

                              <span>Sony does not expect its next-generation PlayStation to arrive until at least 2027, a confidential document has suggested. 


The partially-redacted document was released publicly today as part of the UK&#x27;s ongoing in-depth Competition and Markets Authority review into Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68bn Activision Blizzard buyout - a deal Sony has strongly objected to. 


In an intriguing passage discussing the length of time Call of Duty may remain on PlayStation, Sony claims that (at the time of writing) it expected to lose access to the franchise in 2027. Sony then goes on to state that by the time it &quot;launched the next generation of its PlayStation console... it would have lost access to Call of Duty and other Activision titles&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft has admitted that Sony has more exclusive games that are &quot;better quality&quot; than its own.


The statement comes in documents pertaining to Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which have just been released.


In Microsoft&#x27;s response to the CMA&#x27;s Issues Statement, it claims the proposed merger is pro-competitive due to Sony&#x27;s standing as the dominant platform holder.

                              <span>Nearly nine months on from launch, Gran Turismo 7 has introduced one of its most heavily requested features, as the game&#x27;s 1.26 update finally allows players to sell cars in their garage. 


The inability to sell vehicles was a key part of the criticisms aimed towards the PlayStation exclusive at launch, with a miserly economy and expensive microtransactions souring the experience for many. It&#x27;s a bit baffling that it&#x27;s taken so long, and there&#x27;s still a little uncertainty precisely how it&#x27;ll work and how good the payouts will be, but it does at least come as part of a generous update. 


The big addition that comes with the 1.26 patch is a track that&#x27;s entirely new to Gran Turismo, and is something a bit special. Road Atlanta&#x27;s a 2.5 mile circuit set in the north of the state of Georgia, and is one of the finest road courses in the USA. It plays host to the Petit Le Mans each year, a challenging race that makes the most of its undulations and whip-quick esses for one of the most punishing endurance races where 10 hours feels more like 100 (at least that&#x27;s what it felt like the few times I&#x27;ve run its iRacing virtual equivalent).

Fans of the Ukranian first-person shooter survival horror series have reacted warmly to the news, while work continues on the game&#x27;s official follow-up.


The remaster will launch as a free mod to the original game, creator Andrey0007 stated via ModDB, containing around 16GB of new textures. Plans to also edit the game&#x27;s plot in order to remove some inconsistencies have been scaled back, however.

                              <span>Notorious hacker George &quot;Geohot&quot; Hotz has been hired by Elon Musk to work on Twitter - primarily, to fix the flailing social network&#x27;s search functionality.


Hotz shot to internet fame in 2008 for being the first to jailbreak the iPhone. Around a year later, he followed that feat by hacking the PlayStation 3 - and memorably rapped about Sony&#x27;s subsequent attempts to sue him. The two sides ultimately settled matters outside of court.

Back in September, Bloomberg reported multiple instances of child abuse on the streaming platform. Twitch shared a blog post in response detailing its protection measures.



That blog post has now been updated with further details on the multiple prevention methods put in place.

The job openings are available at the newly-formed Los Angeles developer, Netflix Games Studio, which was announced by the company&#x27;s vice president of gaming Mike Verdu last month. The team is being lead by former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny.
Listings for project directors, a lead engineer, and a live service analyst at Netflix Games Studio were spotted earlier today (thanks, Mobilegamer.biz).

Speaking to Kinda Funny Games on their God of War Ragnarök spoilercast, director Eric Williams was asked whether DLC is on the way.



&quot;I don&#x27;t know, man, that game is big,&quot; said Williams said. &quot;I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn&#x27;t count on it.&quot;

The game is set for release on 2nd December across PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC, but 13 minutes of footage has been shared on YouTube.


Of course, it&#x27;s low quality off-screen footage but it still details the title screen, settings, and the beginning of the story.
