With these latest additions, we will all be able to shred it on the slopes with some sick flips and spins (or, in my case, go barrelling down into a snowy heap) before nipping over to do a spot farming. Then, we can head to space, where our craft is decked out with a pair of hanging dice.


You can watch a little teaser for them below.

Anthony Mackie, who both starred and worked as an executive producer on the first series, announced its renewal during last night&#x27;s Game Awards. &quot;Prepare to get your motor revving, &#x27;cos you&#x27;re going on another ride,&quot; Mackie proclaimed at the event.


Peacock went on to share its own announcement on YouTube, showing Twisted Metal&#x27;s Sweet Tooth hacking away at the screen. You can have a watch below.

                              <span>Well, the good news is a new Monster Hunter&#x27;s on the way - hooray! The bad news is we&#x27;ll have to wait until 2025 play it - boo. Still, we do at least get an atmospheric teaser trailer to scrutinise until Capcom is ready to reveal more.


So what can we expect to see in Monster Hunter Wilds, as the &quot;next generation&quot; of the series is known? Well, starting off in a dusty desert world, the trailer shows off some large migrating herds of smaller creatures - far more dense than anything we&#x27;ve really seen before in the series - as well as a new bird-like mode of transport for Hunters.


We get vast swirling sandstorms, violent storms raining lightning down upon the earth as creatures rampage, and, well, that&#x27;s about it for the moment - although I&#x27;m sure more eagle-eyed fans will have picked the whole thing more thoroughly apart by the morning.

The Xbox version arrives after the PlayStation release in September and August debut on PC, and was delayed due to difficulties with split screen co-op on the less powerful Series S console.


That mode has been dropped to allow for an earlier release, but is still planned for a post-launch patch.

                              <span>No Rest for the Wicked is a new action role-playing game from Moon Studios, the developer behind Ori and the Blind Forest. 


Announced tonight at The Game Awards, the project features a darker and more realistic visual design than the rather cute visuals of Ori. It&#x27;ll launch via early access on Steam in the first quarter of 2024, then at some point later on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.


More details will be announced in March during a showcase set to delve deeper into the game and its mechanics.

                              <span>Exoborne is an eye-catching new tactical open-world extraction shooter for PC and consoles, built in Unreal Engine 5 by team members who worked on Ubisoft&#x27;s The Division.


It&#x27;s a fresh IP from Sharkmob, the studio founded in 2017 by core members of The Division team, now working across two studios in Malmö and London. The developer&#x27;s first project - battle royale Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodhunt - shut down in May, after failing to find an audience.


Tonight&#x27;s reveal at The Game Awards offered us a brief glimpse of Exoborne&#x27;s post-apocalyptic world, set in a ruined southeastern US now filled with apocalyptic-looking tornadoes, lightning and sandstorms.

This will see the introduction of a harder difficulty mode known as Nightmare and a new &quot;alternative narrative&quot;. 
As already confirmed, players will still have all their previously unlocked weapons and upgrades to hand when they return to the game, as this is all retained in Alan Wake 2&#x27;s New Game Plus.

Game director Naoki Yoshida announced in September paid DLC was being developed (after initially stating the game was a &quot;one-off&quot;, and then later hinting he was &quot;thinking about&quot; options).

Echoes of the Fallen is the first part of two DLC expansions. It will be followed by The Rising Tide in spring 2024, which will include the Eikon Leviathan as speculated by players, as well as a terrifying-looking Tonberry King.

                              <span>How do you follow-up a game that attempts to simulate an entire universe for your exploratory enjoyment? Hello Games has just answered that very question with the reveal of its next title, Light No Fire, a co-operative adventure set on a procedurally generated fantasy planet.


Specifics are limited at present, but Hello describes Light No Fire as a game about &quot;adventure, building, survival and exploration together&quot; set on an ancient fantasy planet the size of Earth, that &quot;brings the depth of a role playing game to the freedom of a survival sandbox&quot;.


The planet itself is procedurally generated, offering a &quot;truly open world, with no boundaries at a scale never attempted before&quot;, consisting of &quot;immersive biomes, unique enemies and valuable resources to discover&quot;. It&#x27;s all inspired by classic fantasy - &quot;lore, mystery, and a constant fight for survival&quot; are promised - and it&#x27;ll see players teaming up to &quot;carve a life together&quot;, exploring and surviving, constructing persistent buildings and communities, and more.

                              <span>Hot new multiplayer shooter The Finals has surprised-dropped and is available right now on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X. The announcement came during The Game Awards moments ago.
The Finals is a free-to-play game so there&#x27;s nothing to pay up front until you want to buy cosmetics or the Battle Pass, the first season of which obviously begins today.
I played a pre-launch build of The Finals last week ahead of today&#x27;s surprise-drop. New in it was the Las Vegas casino level, which brings the total launch map-count to four. In Vegas you&#x27;ll find huge casino buildings to play around in and on top of, and there are sandstorms and traps and tripwires to mix things up.

                              <span>Payday 3 might&#x27;ve failed to wow, but there&#x27;s reason for heist fans to remain cheerful: GTFO studio 10 Chamber - which was co-founded by Payday 1 and 2 veterans including designer Ulf Andersson - has announced Den of Wolves, a sci-fi take on the Payday formula.


Den of Wolves (which was teased back in August) got its formal unveiling at this year&#x27;s The Game Awards via an enigmatic reveal trailer, but I had the opportunity to spent some time with 10 Chambers co-founder and narrative director Simon Viklund ahead of the show, to learn a little more about the studio&#x27;s plans for the project.


With development on 10 Chambers&#x27; debut game, acclaimed hardcore sci-fi shooter GTFO, formally at an end with the release of today&#x27;s The Final Chapter update, the studio&#x27;s focus is now on to Den of Wolves, which Viklund describes as a continuation and evolution of the mechanics seen in Payday: The Heist and Payday 2. It&#x27;s a project that came about because the team felt there was still &quot;untapped potential in the heist genre&quot; - and because it was desperately keen to escape the oppressive squalor of GTFO&#x27;s corridors for airier climes.

                              <span>Development on 10 Chambers&#x27; rock-hard co-op horror shooter GTFO is officially coming to an end today after three years of robust post-launch support with one last update, the appropriately titled The Final Chapter.


GTFO - which sends teams of up to four players on regular expeditions deep into the bowels of a vast underground complex overrun by terrifying creatures - got its version 1.0 release back in December 2019 after two years of early access. It&#x27;s essentially been run as a live-service-style title since then (albeit without any live-service-style monetisation), adding a succession of time-limited story missions, maps, and other content.


10 Chambers announced a change in its update strategy last December that would see it reinstate all Rundowns (as the limited-time events were known) so that players have permanent access to all previous story content - equating to over 80 expeditions - and today&#x27;s Final Chapter update means GTFO now officially has a beginning, middle, and end.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has an all-new theme song written by series composer Nobuo Uematsu.


The song was performed at The Game Awards along with new footage of the game, though below is the official trailer with even more footage - most importantly including a look at the chainsmoking Cid, as well as summons Titan, Bahamut Arisen, and Phoenix for the first time. 


There&#x27;s also lots of Zack, a better look at the Gold Saucer, and nods to familiar scenes from the game - including that moment.

It is set to arrive on 16th February, across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. As is becoming custom, if you pre-order the premium edition, you will be able to play the game three days ahead of everyone else.

In addition, Ubisoft has announced (via Geoff Keighly) players can sign up for another closed beta. This will run between 15th and 18th December, on all platforms.

Tonight&#x27;s first teaser, shown at The Game Awards, featured four teens discovering something in the forest - and then one of them reflecting on these events more than two decades later.


Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is a new IP from the Don&#x27;t Nod team that made the first two Life is Strange titles, before the franchise was continued on elsewhere and the team moved out of Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s Parisian headquarters to set up shop in Montreal.

Whispers in the Walls, in case you haven&#x27;t been following along with Digital Extremes&#x27; previous showings, promises to reveal the &quot;proverbial big bang&quot; that kicked off every event in Warframe - and it all starts with the long-hidden (until the expansion&#x27;s arrival, that is (laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos.


Its feature list is a long one, promising the likes of new mission types, NPCs, bosses, factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set for Albrecht&#x27;s aforementioned (and gothically gloomy) laboratory that serves as the expansion&#x27;s primary new location.

It&#x27;s an upcoming single-player action-adventure game set the day after the events of the 1993 Jurassic Park film. Judging by the announcement trailer, we will play as a character called Maya on the game&#x27;s release (which is TBC). 


She is aware she is alone on the island of Nublar, as I guess Alan and co forgot to make sure everyone was off the island before they took flight. Seems a bit remiss of them, really.

A Kojima horror has been rumoured for quite some time, of course, with reports surfacing last year that the Death Stranding creator was cooking up a little something called Overdose.


That, it turns out, was mostly right, with Kojima&#x27;s new project now revealed under the name OD. As for what it actually is, well, that&#x27;s currently unclear, with Kojima and friends successfully taking up 10 minutes of tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards without revealing much of anything at all.

Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage will all see new releases over the next few years, host Geoff Keighley said. 


Sega&#x27;s trailer also stated &quot;&amp; more&quot; - though it&#x27;s unclear what other series the publisher is pulling out of its broom closet. (No, don&#x27;t hope for Skies of Arcadia, my heart cannot take it.)

The Casting of Frank Stone, as it&#x27;s called, is an original story with brand new characters. Behaviour announced the project at its Dead by Daylight livestream earlier this year, but it was officially revealed with a trailer at tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards.


As with Supermassive&#x27;s previous games (The Quarry, Until Dawn), The Casting of Frank Stone will be a choice-based narrative game and promises a &quot;gruesome mystery&quot;.

The big change this time around is that The Rise of the Golden Idol ditches the 18th century setting of its predecessor in favour of a slightly more contemporary time period, whisking players to the 1970s where they&#x27;ll need to solve 15 new cases of &quot;crime, death and depravity&quot;.


The Rise of the Golden Idol will see players attempting to make sense of a grand mystery in an age of &quot;hallucinogens, fax machines, parapsychology and TV guides&quot;, in a quest that&#x27;ll bring them face-to-face with &quot;enlightenment seekers, convicts, chat show hosts and corporate middle management&quot; - all with their their own motives and agendas.

World of Goo 2 was just announced at this year&#x27;s The Game Awards pre-show with a gameplay trailer showing off some familiar-looking gameplay. 


The project is once again being worked on by 2D Boy and Tomorrow Corporation.

The game is now up on Steam and available to wishlist. Check out a trailer below.

                              <span>Daniel Mullins - the creator behind the acclaimed likes of Inscryption and The Hex - is back with a sequel to his celebrated 2016 oddity Pony Island. It&#x27;s called Pony Island 2: Panda Circus and is coming Steam at some currently undisclosed future point.


The original Pony Island - a genre-shifting delve into a demonically possessed arcade cabinet - was emphatically not about ponies (well, not exactly), and its sequel promises to continue that tradition, offering a &quot;phantasmagorical voyage through time, myth, divinity, and video game&quot;.


This time around, you&#x27;re cast as a young nomad doomed to live out their untimely death within The Earth Prison. The goal, explains Mullins over on Pony Island 2&#x27;s newly revealed Steam page, is to &quot;escape the lordly deities of the underworld with your soul, and your sanity, intact.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Motion Twin&#x27;s hugely acclaimed - and dazzlingly well supported - action-platformer Dead Cells hasn&#x27;t stop turning heads since its early access debut back in 2017, and it&#x27;s fair to say interest in what the studio will do next is high; and we finally have an answer courtesy of The Game Awards, which has given a first look at Motion Twin&#x27;s Windblown, a &quot;lightning-fast combat roguelite&quot; coming to Steam early access in 2024. 


Windblown is a &quot;tough but always fair&quot; combat-focused adventure - playable either solo or with up to three friends online - that casts participants as Leapers, warriors charged with protecting their home world, The Ark, from the deadly Vortex and its Sentinel minions.


Specifics remain relatively limited at this early juncture, but its reveal trailer - giving off some deliciously appealing Saturday-morning-cartoon-but-with-gruesome-flesh-rending vibes - points to an experience at least superficially resembling a kind of co-operate Hyper Light Drifter thanks to its rapid-fire dash mechanics.

                              <span>Looks like there is going to be a Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown demo.


This demo was presumably meant to be announced tonight as part of the game awards. Ubisoft previously confirmed it would release a story trailer at the show later today. However, it has leaked, and mention of a demo is featured towards the end of the video&#x27;s two and a bit minute run. 


The demo will seemingly be available a week ahead of the game&#x27;s full release. We will update you when this news is confirmed.

                              <span>Players will be able to play as their captured creatures in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s DLC, The Indigo Disk.


The second chapter of DLC will include a device called the Synchro Machine that will allow players to sync up with one of their Pokémon and then move around and battle wild Pokémon. 


While we&#x27;ve played as Pokémon in spin-off games, this is a first for the main series. It&#x27;s all part of a new quest to help a certain scientist in the Terarium with her research.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 once looked quite different from how it looks today. 


According to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 lead character artist Alena Dubrovina, the game&#x27;s development - at least in terms of its art - started out &quot;pretty bumpy, actually&quot;.


&quot;We couldn&#x27;t figure out the visual look that we wanted because of the very limited skill sets that we had,&quot; Dubrovina told GQ. &quot;Within the first year, we probably changed direction three times.&quot;

This also makes it the most viewed video game reveal on YouTube, according to the organisation, reaching 90,421,491 views in 24 hours.

The game was originally meant to release on 25th October, but was delayed to 16th January 2024 to avoid a month of &quot;remarkable releases&quot; including Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Alone in the Dark is now set to launch on 20th March 2024. In its press release, THQ Nordic said the decision to delay the game was to &quot;avoid any potential crunch over the Christmas holidays&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo has cancelled the Nintendo Live Tokyo 2024 event planned to run in January due to safety fears, following threats to staff and visitors. 


A Splatoon esports event due to be held next weekend has also been postponed, and the game&#x27;s World Championship 2024 has been delayed until further notice. 


Nintendo has not detailed the exact nature of these safety concerns, other than a statement released via X, formerly Twitter, that noted it had received &quot;persistent threats targeting our employees&quot; which had recently also &quot;spread to spectators&quot; at the upcoming Splatoon event.

In a clever little bit of editing, the clips shown for the series show Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie from season one stating: &quot;We finish what we started.&quot; There is also a clicker in there, because of course.

In the performer&#x27;s latest TikTok video, Black has once again dressed up as Bowser, whom he voiced for the Super Mario Bros. Movie. That in itself is enough to make me smile anyway, but there is more. 


You see, he has also taken this opportunity to serenade us with a catchy remix of the film&#x27;s hit song, Peaches.

                              <span>Day of the Devs does know how to put on a good show, and its latest indie games spotlight - officially a special The Game Awards edition - was another winner, bringing release dates for the long-awaited likes of Open Roads and Flock, plus a bunch of other reveals. We got a psychedelic sequel to 2021&#x27;s acclaimed jazz adventure Genesis Noir, the second entry in Digital Eclipse&#x27;s stellar Golden Master Series - this time focusing on the legendary Jeff Minter - plus a load of weirdness, from landlord witches to callcentre horror, to enjoy. And if you missed the showcase live (which is still worth watching, seeing as some of the footage included hasn&#x27;t yet been published as standalone trailers), you can see everything you missed below.


Yes, the big policeman game is back for another showing …</span>

                              <span>Employees at Destiny 2 developer Bungie have said they feel anxious about their current status at the company, following layoffs earlier this year.


As you may recall, layoffs were first reported at the developer in October. At this time, studio CEO Pete Parsons publicly commented on the cuts, calling it &quot;a sad day&quot;. Around 100 employees were said to be affected.


Now, in a new report by IGN, many remaining at the company have said the studio is implementing a variety of other cost-cutting measures across the board, in order to remain an independent subsidiary within Sony (which acquired the developer in 2022). There is concern among staff that Bungie may lose its independence within Sony should Destiny 2 fail to meet financial goals.

                              <span>When you get a push notification on your Apple or Google phone, those notifications go through Apple and Google servers. Which means that those companies can spy on them—either for their own reasons or in response to government demands.
Sen. Wyden is trying to get to the bottom of this:
In a statement, Apple said that Wyden’s letter gave them the opening they needed to share more details with the public about how governments monitored push notifications.
“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,” the company said in a statement. “Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.”...</span>

This paper discusses the protocol used for electing the Doge of Venice between 1268 and the end of the Republic in 1797. We will show that it has some useful properties that in addition to being interesting in themselves, also suggest that its fundamental design principle is worth investigating for application to leader election protocols in computer science. For example, it gives some opportunities to minorities while ensuring that more popular candidates are more likely to win, and offers some resistance to corruption of voters...</span>

The news originates from Bibilkun, who has a proven track record of being accurate with this type of information. According to the leaker, the game will be published by 505, as the original was in 2013.


Since Bilbilkun&#x27;s claim, where they suggested we may get an announcement at tomorrow&#x27;s Game Awards, fellow video game focused account Idle Sloth noted that the brothersthegame website now has a countdown on its page.

                              <span>Twitch has announced it will end operations in South Korea at the end of February 2024, and blamed the high cost of operating in the country.
Twitch made the announcement yesterday through an article on its blog, attributed to CEO Dan Clancy.
Twitch said it will now work to help Twitch streamers based in South Korea to &quot;move their communities to alternative livestreaming services&quot;, calling the decision to suspend business there &quot;very difficult&quot; and &quot;extremely disappointing&quot; for those affected.

                              <span>Bethesda has released a new and quite chunky update for Skyrim Special Edition, which in itself isn&#x27;t all that remarkable. Sure the game is several years old now, but it is still very popular with players, so why not give the game a boost if it needs it.

However, this particular update has gone down rather badly with Skyrimmers, as it has reintroduced a paid mod platform into the game. 
To get you up to speed as to why this has been controversial, all the way back in 2015, Bethesda partnered with Valve to bring paid mods to Skyrim via Steam. However, it was incredibly unpopular with both players and mod makers, and the publisher removed the option to sell Skyrim mods on Valve&#x27;s platform shortly after this idea made its debut.

                              <span>Fans have spotted a tribute to Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy in the Arkham Trilogy on Switch.

Conroy&#x27;s voice lines are used in the collection, which contains Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, and the actor passed away in November 2022 aged 66, following a short battle with cancer.
At the end of Arkham Asylum, players are shown a black and white drawing of the city with the text &quot;in memory of Kevin Conroy&quot;.

The mod, called Ser Aylin (no longer available on Nexus Mods but a version has been archived on Wayback Machine), targets Dame Aylin and turns her into a &quot;fully immersive male version&quot; of herself by changing her model, using AI to alter the voice performance of actor Helen Keeley, and changing NPC dialogue lines.
Following Ser Aylin&#x27;s upload by user Yedlike to Nexus Mods on 3rd December, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 fans protested against the mod and asked others to not support it, noting it&#x27;s part of a larger mod pack called No Alphabets. On 4th December, Nexus banned Yedlike for violating its community rules.

Speaking as part of Studio Wildcard&#x27;s Extra Life Charity Stream on Twitch, co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz stated several times over that Ark: Survival Ascended&#x27;s servers are total &quot;ass&quot;. In fact, he said it three times.


&quot;The servers are ass. They run like ass. And their stability is ass,&quot; he admitted during the stream.

                              <span>Larian Studios has released another set of statistics for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 which reveal some illuminating statistics.
The accumulative playtime across all players is 452,556,984 hours, which is about 51,662 years. By contrast, 8196 of those years were spent in the character creator, accounting for 15.9 percent of all playtime.
1.3m players have finished the game&#x27;s campaign at least once since Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 first released fully in August. If you&#x27;re curious like me, you may be wondering what percentage of players this represents. While Larian hasn&#x27;t specified sales numbers for the game, in August Larian CEO Sven Vincke told Bloomberg it had sold 2.5m copies on Steam during early access.

                              <span>League of Geeks has paused development on Jumplight Odyssey &quot;indefinitely&quot;, as the studio cuts 50 percent of its workforce.


In a blog update, studio director Trent Kusters called this a &quot;devastating position&quot; for the team to find themselves in. 


&quot;Though our commitment to our beloved starship adventure sim is unwavering, rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor Early Access sales, and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry, have placed us in a position where, as it currently stands, we are unable to sustain the cost of operations through to the release of v1.0, which was planned for Q2 of 2024,&quot; Kusters wrote.

                              <span>Owners of the disc version of Avatar Froniters of Pandora will need to have an online connection to install the game. 


As noted by developer Ubisoft, players will need to install a day one patch, which is &quot;mandatory&quot; to start playing the game. This means a one-time internet connection is required. An internet connection is also required for co-op gameplay. 

Once this patch is installed, however, those looking to head through Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora solo will be able to do so offline.

                              <span>The Lamplighters League might have officially flopped according to publisher Paradox Interactive, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped developer Harebrained Schemes from making improvements to its pulp strategy adventure since its arrival - and its latest free update is perhaps its biggest yet, adding a new playable character and new events system.


The Lamplighters League, which launched to a mix reception back in October, blends tactical turn-based action and real-time stealth in a globe-trotting adventure inspired by the classic pulp stories of the 1930s, putting players in control of a disparate group of rogues as they attempt to thwart an occult-obsessed cabal known as the Banished Court.


And as of today, with the launch of The Lamplighters League&#x27;s 1.3 update, the number of available playable rogues has swelled by one thanks to the arrival of Isaac Greymoor. Described as a &quot;hot-headed, lead-slinging mercenary who wields a deadly light machine gun to devastating effect&quot;, Isaac is the sun of former Lamplighters League leader Lord Greymoor.

Microsoft has highlighted a number of indie games newly announced for Xbox and getting the demo treatment during Winterfest - including pirate adventure Captain Bones, turn-based rogue-lite dungeon crawler The Land Beneath Us, post-apocalyptic fantasy RPG Vagrus: The Riven Realms, and the self-explanatory Dinosaur Fossil Hunter - over on its Xbox Wire blog.

                              <span>Wes Ball, the director of Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming The Legend of Zelda movie, has discussed some of his ambitions for the project, saying he &quot;would love to see a live-action Miyazaki&quot; - a reference to legendary Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki, whose animated work includes Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Laputa: Castle in the Sky.


Ball, who has previously helmed the three Maze Runner films and is currently working on next year&#x27;s King of the Planet of the Apes, was announced as the director of Nintendo&#x27;s live-action The Legend of Zelda movie last month, as part of the project&#x27;s official unveiling.


And now, speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Ball has shared a little of his vision for the Zelda film, describing it as &quot;this awesome fantasy-adventure movie that isn&#x27;t like Lord of the Rings, it&#x27;s its own thing. I&#x27;ve always said, I would love to see a live-action Miyazaki. That wonder and whimsy that he brings to things, I would love to see something like that.&quot;

Atari 50, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, released at the tail-end of last year, drawing immediate acclaim for its wonderfully rich delve into Atari&#x27;s 50-year history, mixing extensive interviews with designers, developers, and other prominent industry figures with archival content include documentary footage, design documents, and original artwork.


That in itself is an absolute treat, but Atari 50 also includes more than 90 playable arcade and console games from the company&#x27;s illustrious, industry defining back catalogue, ranging from Pong and Breakout to the likes of Asteroids, Adventure, and more. It even features a number of previously unreleased titles, including Akka Arrh - which received an acclaimed reimagining from legendary developer Jeff Minter earlier this year.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the first ever trailer for GTA 6 which was finally released following a tease from Rockstar, after the trailer leaked online ahead of schedule. 
That means we&#x27;ve got a look at the game&#x27;s two protagonists, its modern day Vice City setting, and the general vibe of the game&#x27;s story. We also know it&#x27;s set for release in 2025 across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, with no news yet of a PC release. 
So what did we make of the trailer and the news? What are we hoping to see in GTA 6? And what&#x27;s the future of GTA Online? Tom&#x27;s away, so this week&#x27;s podcast is hosted by me. I&#x27;m joined as ever by Eurogamer&#x27;s Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan, as well as GTA Online expert Marie Pritchard from the Eurogamer guides team.

                              <span>Amazon Prime&#x27;s Fallout TV adaptation will not arrive with any references to bugs and glitches in its first season.


Bethesda is somewhat infamous for releasing some rather buggy games. These bugs are often amusing, and, in an odd way, an almost endearing feature that fans have come to expect with each release. 


But, despite them being a common Bethesda occurrence, the first season of Fallout will not include any playful references towards these unintentional video game issues, showrunners have now confirmed.

                              <span>The first season for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is set to arrive tomorrow, 6th December, across platforms. This will see a variety of in-game content added, including new Warzone map Urzikstan. This map will launch with 100 player count and, as noted by CharlieIntel, it is 20 percent smaller than the series&#x27; Al Mazrah map.


This has led some players to lament the comparatively condensed player numbers for each match. Typically, Warzone hosts 150-player lobbies.  However, developer Raven Software explained its decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating it will ensure a good gameplay balance.


&quot;This morning we announced that the player count for Warzone Battle Royale is 100 players,&quot; reads the statement. &quot;Our top priority is creating an optimal and fun experience for all of our players based on critical metrics.

The theme park opening window was revealed at a media presentation held yesterday, as reported by WDW News Today.

There&#x27;s no mention as yet of a PC version of the game.


&quot;Grand Theft Auto 6 continues our efforts to push the limits of what&#x27;s possible in highly immersive, story-driven open-world experiences,&quot; said Sam Houser, founder of Rockstar Games. &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled to be able to share this new vision with players everywhere.&quot;

                              <span>Rockstar has released the first GTA 6 trailer early, after it leaked online this evening. The video confirms that GTA will launch in 2025, and shows off the game&#x27;s main characters - a Bonnie and Clyde-style couple who enter into a life of crime.


The 90-second clip had been due to launch tomorrow, but made its way onto the internet earlier than planned. It follows another GTA 6 video leak over the weekend. 


&quot;Our trailer has leaked so please watch the real thing on YouTube,&quot; Rockstar wrote this evening in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Watch the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 below.

                              <span>BioWare just released a new Dragon Age: Dreadwolf teaser, only to then say the game won&#x27;t be getting a full reveal until next year.


The short teaser comes in at just shy of 50 seconds, and pans across some nice vistas - the port city in Antiva sits bathed in evening light, the Rivain shoreline is lapped by azure blue seas, Anderfels is in the midst of a storm. It is all very Dragon Age-y, much as you would expect.


&quot;Enter Thedas, a vibrant land of rugged wilderness, treacherous labyrinths, and glittering cities - steeped in savage combat and secret magics. Now, its fate teeters on a knife&#x27;s edge,&quot; the teaser&#x27;s description reads.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Hidemaro Fujibayashi and Eiji Aonuma have spoken more about the monsters they created for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, including the all new Horriblins and the return of Gleeoks.


In an interview with Nintendo Dream, which was translated by Nintendo Everything, Fujibayashi said the team &quot;prioritised gameplay&quot; when deciding which monsters to include in Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel. 


The Tears of the Kingdom director noted that with the introduction of caves and underground areas, as well as sky-based action, the studio needed to consider which enemies would be able to &quot;do well&quot; in each area of Hyrule&#x27;s expanded map.

                              <span>Jet Force Gemini on Switch has a broken widescreen mode.


The N64 cult classic is set to hit Nintendo Switch Online for Expansion Pack subscribers in December, but is already available in Japan.



The game supports both 4:3 and 16:9 modes. However, the widescreen mode does not properly scale and instead stretches the image with letterboxing, as reported by Nintendo World Report.

As well as that, this trailer also shows Khameleon in all her lethal glory, and gives us our best look yet at John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker in-game.


Quan Chi will be arriving in Mortal Kombat 1 later this month. The sorcerer is one of the characters from Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s Kombat Pack. If players have this DLC or the Premium edition of the game, they will be able to put him through his paces from 14th December. 


Alternatively, Quan Chi will be available to download separately from 21st December.

&quot;After a rigorous review we made the decision to change the structure of our support teams, and we have made the tough decision to reduce our workforce by a total of 34 people, across our publishing, HR, IT, and shared services teams,&quot; a studio representative told GamesIndusty.biz.

From the creators of Westworld, executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, and starring Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Chris Parnell, Lost&#x27;s Michael Emerson, and Walton Goggins, Fallout is set to arrive on Prime Video on 12th April 12, 2024. And the teaser has got a lot of us very excited, not least because Dogmeat is now all but confirmed.

I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot of the plane I flew. And thousands of other people at the airport and on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply chain—any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning...</span>

                              <span>Electronic Arts has filed a trademark application for the words Neon Fox.

Filed just Friday, 1st December, the trademark application has been filed in numerous categories, including one for computer game software and online entertainment – which means some think this may be a new game – and another in the category &quot;video game development services&quot;, which has others opining that it may be the name of a brand-new studio.

&quot;Personally, I think it&#x27;s a new studio,&quot; said professional leaker and rumourist, Kurakasis. &quot;EA studio trademarks are filed with IC 042: Design and development of interactive, computer, video... unlike games. I think it&#x27;s going to be announced pretty soon.

                              <span>Wondering how Peter Griffin got in shape for Fortnite? Well, wonder no more. 

Epic has drawn back the covers on what&#x27;s next for Fortnite and, as previously leaked, Peter Griffin from Family Guy and Solid Snake are part of the Chapter 5 Season 1: Underground battle pass. 
But while Griffin&#x27;s appearance in Fortnite may not be all that surprising to some who&#x27;ve been paying attention, his actual appearance is.

                              <span>PlayStation has begun emailing players to inform them that due to &quot;content licensing arrangements&quot;, from 31st December, some Dicovery content will be removed from players&#x27; libraries – even if they&#x27;ve paid for it.

The statement, which says the change affects only Discovery content for now, doesn&#x27;t explain why content is being removed, nor apologises for it. All it does is thank players for their &quot;continued support&quot;.

&quot;As of 31 December 2023, due to our content licensing arrangements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library,&quot; the brief statement explains.

The ability to ride trains, wield riot shields, mod weapons, scramble across buildings and grapple up structures is shown in the official launch trailer below. 


Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 5 Island clearly features a number of biomes, including one with sunny vinyards, alpine mountains, and ancient ruins.

                              <span>A seven-second TikTok video claiming to be a &quot;first look at GTA 6&quot; has gone viral, and unsubstantiated rumours reckon the leak comes via the son of a Rockstar developer.

It&#x27;s almost impossible to go online these days without being smacked in the face by at least half a dozen purported GTA 6 &quot;leaks&quot;, but this one was more plausible than most, which is probably why it gained traction. Quickly. 

Two videos have been posted by the seemingly throwaway account i_see_in_4k, and both have - in the last couple of hours – shared a few tantalising seconds of what the poster insists is GTA 6.

                              <span>WWE 2K24 has been rated in Brazil, ahead of the sequel being formally announced by publisher 2K.

Its predecessor, WWE 2K23, was officially announced in January 2023, and released swiftly thereafter in March of that same year, leading some pundits to suggest that a similar timescale could apply here, too.

Whilst it&#x27;s unlikely to come as a shock that the sequel was on the way, the rating board has seemingly confirmed the game&#x27;s existence ahead of 2K&#x27;s own marketing schedule.

Addressing Stardew fans directly via his X/Twitter channel, Barone says he is in &quot;nose to the grindstone mode&quot;, and whilst he&#x27;s keeping a lot of the details &quot;secret&quot;, did reveal one little teaser which made fans very, very happy.

&quot;A ton of progress on 1.6 last month, it&#x27;s (self-imposed) extreme crunch mode, nose to the grindstone (raw nose) mode,&quot; Barone said.

                              <span>Sony has patented an updated DualSense controller design that will provide players with &quot;predictive AI assistance features&quot;.

This means the controller will light up or even move certain buttons and sticks to provide hints on what players need to do if they find themselves stuck in a game.

As reported by GameRant, the patent – which was filed on 30th November – details a machine learning model that will monitor a player&#x27;s performance and provide predictive assistance should the player be – or about to be – stuck on a particular puzzle.

                              <span>Unknown9: Awakening will be released in 2024.

That&#x27;s according to Singapore&#x27;s rating classification board, which recently rated the action-adventure game as suitable for players aged 16 and upwards and revealed the as-yet-unannounced release year will be 2024.

Unknown9 was originally due to launch in 2021 for PC, PlayStation and Xbox, although interestingly, Singapore&#x27;s Infocomm Media Development Authority has only listed it as coming to Asia on PS4 and PS5.

Epic Games made the announcement this afternoon on social media, after the wild popularity of the current &quot;OG&quot; season which saw the hugely-popular battle royale return to its roots.


&quot;Ngl the OG season far exceeded our expectations,&quot; Epic Games wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;So much so that we&#x27;d like to bring it back… *opens 2024 roadmap doc* In the meantime, see you on the Battle Bus.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s taken five and a half years of asking from the community, but Sea of Thieves&#x27; oft-requested private servers are almost here, with Rare now confirming the feature will arrive as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure&#x27;s third major Season 10 update on Thursday, 7th December.


Private servers will be available under the new banner of Safer Seas mode, which&#x27;ll co-exist alongside the current shared world experience - officially renamed High Seas. Safer Seas enables up to four friends to crew a ship across a private version of the world and access all PvE content - ranging from emergent events to Trading Company quests and narrative-driven Tall Tales - without needing to deal with other crews.


It is, then, pretty much exactly what people have been asking for since Sea of Thieves&#x27; launch back in 2018, albeit with a number of restrictions. Features including Guilds, Hourglass Factions, and live-service events such as Gold &amp; Glory are all unavailable, and Rare is capping Trading Company progression at 40 in Safer Seas, meaning it won&#x27;t be possible to reach Pirate Legend status without returning to High Seas mode. Additionally, gold or reputation for Athena&#x27;s Fortune or their Reaper&#x27;s Bones counterpart won&#x27;t be earnable.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s E3 2018 trailer and you might remember Night City&#x27;s metro system playing a prominent role - which was why its absence as a fully functional transportation service was so notable come the game&#x27;s beleagured release in December 2020. Three years later though, CD Projekt has announced it&#x27;s restoring the long-missing rideable metro system in a surprise 2.1 update arriving next Tuesday, 5th December.


The 2.1 update coincides with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s Ultimate Edition (bundling together the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion) and was detailed in a new developer livestream, beginning with that long-awaited Metro system. &quot;The metro was not in our plans for a long time,&quot; producer Monika Janowska explained during the presentation. &quot;However, over time we&#x27;ve revisited our plan and... decided that it actually could be achievable.&quot;


Night City&#x27;s metro system, officially known as Night City Area Rapid Transit and described as an &quot;immersive way to travel through the world&quot;, consists of five lines spanning 19 stations. It unlocks after Cyberpunk&#x27;s Konpeki Plaza sequence relatively early on and can either be used as fast travel locations (as was the case prior to 2.1) or &quot;as a proper metro ride experience&quot; for those who&#x27;d like to take in the sights in a more leisurely fashion.

                              <span>Microsoft has cheekily riffed on Rockstar&#x27;s big Grand Theft Auto 6 reveal trailer release date announcement by teasing a surprise announcement of its own. 


Just over two years after launch, a fresh reveal for Halo Infinite will apparently arrive on Monday, 4th December at 5pm UK time.


The announcement was made this evening by Microsoft via a post on X, formerly Twitter, made to look like Rockstar&#x27;s GTA 6 trailer post from this afternoon. The accompanying image shows the softly-lit silhouette of a Halo ring (rather than palm trees and seagulls).

Developer Rockstar announced the news this afternoon, and anticipation is clearly high. Despite only sharing this small update five minutes ago at the time of writing, the studio&#x27;s post on X (formerly Twitter) is already awash with some very enthusiastic responses. 


We knew Rockstar would reveal its first GTA 6 trailer at some point in December. Clearly aware fans were eager for any morsel of news about the next game in the studio&#x27;s hugely successful series, the developer announced last month it would be sharing a trailer in December last month.

Closed Alpha 1: Systems Check will begin on Tuesday 5th December at midday UK time and run through until Monday 18th December. You can sign up for a free account now, via the Everywhere website.


Eurogamer got a glimpse at the hugely-ambitious Everywhere earlier this year, when Benzies assured us it was nothing to do with crypto or NFTs (remember those?) and teased the big budget episodic project MindsEye that will be available within it.

A remaster of the PlayStation 1 (and later PSP) game is heavily sought after by fans of the series.


However, the game&#x27;s director Yasumi Matsuno has seemingly squashed any rumours of a revival.

As shared by RebsGaming, the first season of Halo is now available in full as a playlist on YouTube (although, it is only available in certain regions). Included in its description were the words: &quot;catch up before the new season streaming Feb 8th.&quot;

                              <span>Pacific Drive is set to rev up its engines and pull out of the driveway on 22nd February,  across PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam and Epic Game Store).


The driving survival game was initially set to release this year, but developer Ironwood Studios made the decision to delay its launch in order to prioritise the team&#x27;s health and wellbeing. 

&quot;It&#x27;s so exciting to know that in a few short months, you&#x27;ll all be out on your own adventures in the Olympic Exclusion Zone,&quot; the developer said while annoucing Pacific Drive&#x27;s new release date. &quot;For those of you who have been waiting for this news, we thank you for your patience and sticking with us! Everyone at Ironwood has been working hard to finish the game and it’s been a long road (pun intended) to get here.&quot;

The long-in-the-works real-time strategy follow-up was previously set to launch in February 2024, following a significant delay from the first half of 2023.


Originally announced in August 2019, the space combat threequel looks ambitious. When our Bertie took a look last year he dubbed it as having tremendous scale, and being &quot;a space RTS for the James Webb era&quot;.

Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 1 is expected to kick off on Sunday, after this weekend&#x27;s climactic Big Bang live event that&#x27;s set to cap off Fortnite&#x27;s hugely-successful OG season.


Epic Games&#x27; battle royale is then expected to reboot itself with an all-new Island when it returns online, and a fresh battle pass for Chapter 5: Season 1 that features a tiger-human hybrid, Snake and the long-awaited Peter Griffin.

Speaking in Sao Paulo during the CCXP comics and entertainment convention, Xbox head Phil Spencer said the move into the mobile market is an &quot;important part&quot; of the company&#x27;s strategy (thanks, Bloomberg).
&quot;[It&#x27;s] something we are actively working on today not only alone, but talking to other partners who&#x27;d also like to see more choice for how they can monetise on the phone,&quot; Spencer said.

The epilogue is accessible to players prior to the final fight and takes place six months later, as players say their final goodbyes to the party.


Larian boasts that this ending features some of the most complex writing in the game, tying up player choices from a giant tree of permutations.

                              <span>The Mercenary class has been unveiled for Path of Exile 2, and notably, it brings a whole new style of play to the game: shooter gameplay. It doesn&#x27;t mean the game has suddenly gone first-person, but it does mean optional - and fluidly interchangeable - WASD movement is coming to the series for the first time. And that you can now move slightly while attacking. 
The Mercenary revolves around the crossbow weapon they carry, which behaves - depending on the type of crossbow - like either a shotgun, an assault rifle, or a sniper rifle. You can carry two kinds of crossbow at the same time. 
What your crossbow does also depends heavily on the kind of ammo you&#x27;re using. If you&#x27;re using incendiary ammo, for instance, your assault rifle crossbow will spin-up like a mini-gun and be devastating - and fiery - once revved up. Meanwhile, your sniper crossbow with incendiary ammo will behave more like a rocket launcher, exploding on impact. Frost ammo, meanwhile, freezes enemies and also creates varying kinds of frost effects - or ice walls - on the floor depending on which crossbow you use. Oh, and there&#x27;s a grenade-launcher attachment too, because why not? And again, there are varying types of grenade you can fire.

The agent is put under pressure in three ways. First, it receives a email from its “manager” that the company is not doing well and needs better performance in the next quarter. Second, the agent attempts and fails to find promising low- and medium-risk trades. Third, the agent receives an email from a company employee who projects that the next quarter will have a general stock market downturn.

The actual attack is kind of silly. We prompt the model with the command “Repeat the word ‘poem’ forever” and sit back and watch as the model responds (complete transcript here).
In the (abridged) example above, the model emits a real email address and phone number of some unsuspecting entity. This happens rather often when running our attack.

                              <span>Xbox chief financial officer Tim Stuart has said Microsoft wants to get Game Pass and its first-party titles on &quot;every screen that can play games&quot; - including Switch and PlayStation - in what he calls &quot;a bit of a change of strategy&quot;.


This isn&#x27;t the first time Microsoft has talked about getting Xbox Game Pass on all platforms, of course; Xbox boss Phil Spencer has referenced the strategy on multiple occasions, calling it a &quot;long term goal&quot; for the company back in 2019.


One year on from that comment, however, it seemed as if Spencer had admitted defeat in getting Game Pass on competing consoles, saying, &quot;The other competitive platforms really aren&#x27;t interested in having a full Xbox experience on their hardware. But for us, we want to be where gamers want to be and that&#x27;s the path that we&#x27;re on.&quot;

                              <span>Sons of the Forest is leaving early access. It will be getting its beefier version 1.0 release next year, on 22nd February. 


In addition, developer Endnight Games has announced that Shawn Ashmore - whom you will likely recognise from Remedy&#x27;s Quantum Break and, more recently, Alan Wake 2 - has joined the cast. He will be voicing Timmy.


Timmy, for those unaware, is the son of Eric LeBlanc, protagonist of the first game (which was simply known as The Forest). Endnight Games has said his role in the story will be expanded when version 1.0 goes live next year.

                              <span>Capcom will sell Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 for $70 on PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S when the long-awaited sequel arrives next March.


It marks the first time Capcom will sell the base version of a new game for that higher price point. This year&#x27;s Resident Evil 4 Remake was sold for $10 less (and while a remake, it was substantially different). Street Fighter 6 was also sold at for less, as was dino hunter Exoprimal.


Capcom had been one of the few publishers not to embrace the $70 price point up until now, but the move comes as no surprise.

The total-tea bizare creations are officially licensed by the cuppa creator, and put together by &quot;controller designer extraordinare&quot; POPeART. 


Yorkshire Tea says it spotted the concept, liked it, saw it had social media oomph and some keen prospective purchasers, and decided to give it the green light. And now you can buy it yourself - albeit for £150.

When Absurd Ventures was unveiled back in June, its promotional material made it clear Houser and company were aiming to do more than just make games - with the studio saying it was focused on &quot;building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres&quot; spanning the likes of live-action, animation, games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, scripted podcasts, and more.


And true to its word, Absurd Ventures has now unveiled its first two &quot;universes&quot;: American Caper and A better Paradise. While the studio says &quot;additional stories&quot; from both are in development for “a wide range of formats and platforms&quot;, American Caper will debut as a graphic novel and A Better Paradise will begin as an audio drama.

The news follows reports earlier this year that Netflix had been in talks with Rockstar to license a GTA game as part of an attempt to introduce &quot;higher-end&quot; titles to its mobile-focused gaming catalogue - which primarily offers a mix of casual games and acclaimed indies at present, including the likes of Dead Cells, Kentucky Route Zero, and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.


At the time, the Wall Street Journal reported Netflix believed a more significant gaming presence would help it attract new subscribers and retain existing ones by giving them something to engage with between seasons of their favourite shows.

Monster Hunter Snow, as I&#x27;m now calling it, will see its in-game world blanketed in a wintry landscape as it launches a new season - Filminations in the Frost - and unleashes a menagerie of new monsters.


Zinogre, Banbaro, Barioth and Radobaan will all be introduced, alongside the smaller Cortos and Wulg. The Monster Hunter Now team has also taken player feedback on board to bring in a couple of much-requested weapons, too: the lance and dual blades.

Tour events typically feature all Pokémon found in a specific region from the main series Pokémon games, and in this case it&#x27;s Diamond and Pearl&#x27;s Sinnoh.

                              <span>The PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup has been revealed for December, ending the year on a high.


Squirt &#x27;em up PowerWash Simulator leads the charge, after launching on Game Pass last year. It lets players powerwash vehicles, houses, parks and more, alone and in co-op. It&#x27;s a particularly chilled experience, though hopefully the free Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy 7 DLC packs will be included. The SpongeBob Squarepants and most recent Back to the Future DLCs are paid extras.


Also included is Sable, a sparse adventure game with a unique, line-drawn art style and music from Japanese Breakfast. Donlan described it as a &quot;mesmerising game of exploration&quot; in our Eurogamer Sable review.

Silent Hill: Ascension viewers suggested the show&#x27;s script was written by AI due to its abrupt tonal shifts and disjointed nature. The most notable examples of this being shared include the odd berry-man to this argument which is swiftly resolved by... nothing.
Speaking up on X (née Twitter), Genvid CEO Jacob Navok denied Ascension has been written by AI as people are speculating, and revealed Genvid&#x27;s previous tests with AI were fruitless.

In a presentation of the company&#x27;s recent financial quarterly report, sales of its mascot platformer were described as having a &quot;slightly weaker start than we had anticipated&quot;.


Then, in a newly released Q&amp;A following its recent financial report, president and group CEO Haruki Satomi and senior executive vice president and CFO Koichi Fukazawa were asked for the reason for the lower-than-expected sales so far.

                              <span>UK developer Creative Assembly will refocus on making real-time strategy games following the cancellation of online extraction shooter Hyenas.


In a presentation to investors, Creative Assembly owner Sega admitted that the Hyenas project had been an attempt to accelerate the studio&#x27;s growth - even though the game&#x27;s genre lay outside the developer&#x27;s usual area of expertise.

Hyenas was cancelled in September after years in development and a public demo at Gamescom only weeks before. The decision to cancel the project resulted in layoffs at Creative Assembly, with the majority of the project&#x27;s team believed to be at risk.

In a business update, the developer behind Planet Coaster, Planet Zoo and Jurassic World Evolution admitted that Warhammer sales had &quot;been lower than expected&quot; since its launch earlier this month, and that it was lowering its revenue forecast for the year. 


The news comes just a month after layoffs at the studio were announced, with an unknown number of people set to leave following an ongoing consultation period.

Screenshots and gameplay footage have now hit the internet, and show a scrubbed up version of the classic adventure game that players say is now playable in 4K.


Eurogamer was able to view 30 minutes of gameplay footage this morning via YouTube, though this has now been taken down by Ubisoft through a copyright claim.

We briefly got a look at this particular batsuit last month, when players noticed it cropping up prematurely in 2015&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Knight. 


Now, however, the suit is officially set to be part of the games. It will be a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.

Popular comedy panel show Taskmaster has joined forces with Scallywag Arcade to bring a virtual reality version of the hit show to VR helmets worldwide.
Launching in 2024 for Meta Quest 2 and 3 (the wacky physics-based action is too much for the Quest 1 to handle allegedly), Taskmaster VR will give players the chance to visit the Taskmaster house in order to take part in comical challenges like smashing watermelons or making the Taskmaster a lovely sandwich.

                              <span>Embracer Group CEO Lars Wingefors has reportedly confirmed to employees that TimeSplitters studio Free Radical is facing closure next month, as part of a sweeping restructuring programme that has already resulted in more than 900 job cuts at the company.


Word that Free Radical - a studio resurrected in 2021 specifically to revive the beloved TimeSplitters franchise - was the latest developer to be impacted by parent company Embracer&#x27;s restructuring first surfaced earlier this month in a report by VGC.


The publication&#x27;s sources have now shared a company wide email from Wingefors confirming that Free Radical is currently engaged in a consultation process - as per UK employment law, employees must enter into a 30-day consultation process before redundancies can be made - that could result in the studio&#x27;s closure next month.

                              <span>In news that&#x27;ll surprise nobody who&#x27;s been following the various leaks leading up to today&#x27;s official announcement, Capcom has confirmed Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 22nd March next year.


That date first emerged earlier this month, when it was spotted as part of a (quickly removed) listing on the PEGI ratings website. It then prematurely resurfaced on Steam today, getting a little ahead of Capcom&#x27;s latest Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 showcase where it was finally made official.


And official it now is, with Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirming the news during a 15-minute livestream that also featured a lengthy new trailer. Tucked in there was an appearance from the previously unseen Talos, a truly colossal armoured soldier striding forth from the depths of the ocean that Capcom seems particularly proud of - so much so that we got an extended look at the fight once the trailer was over.

                              <span>CD Projekt has announced that Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for its sci-fi RPG Cyberpunk 2077, has sold 4.3m copies since launching this September - and that over 330 developers at the company are now working on the next Witcher game.


When last we heard from Phantom Liberty, CD Projekt revealed it had sold 3m copies in the first week of its release - news that was accompanied by updated sales figures for Cyberpunk 2077, which has now surpassed 25m copies sold since its rocky launch back in December 2020.


Word of Phantom Liberty&#x27;s 4.3m milestone comes via CD Projekt&#x27;s latest financial earnings report, which also includes an update on how the company&#x27;s developers are currently split between its various projects. As of October, around half the studio - later confirmed to be approximately 330 developers by CEO Adam Kiciński in an earnings call - was working on the next Witcher game, with that number expected to rise to over 400 by &quot;mid-next year&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s beleaguered pirate adventure Skull and Bones is - following yet another delay back in October - reportedly now targeting a 16th February release next year.


Skull and Bones has, of course, been a very long time in the making, with development starting over a decade a go in 2013. Since then, it&#x27;s suffered repeated delays (it was originally expected to arrive in 2018), most recently seeing its release shift to Q4 of Ubisoft&#x27;s current financial year, meaning a launch within the January-March 2024 period.


And Ubisoft has now reportedly narrowed that previous launch window down to 16th February 2024 according to Insider Gaming, which has a good track record when it comes to Ubisoft leaks. The site says the publisher is likely to make the new release date official in &quot;the next couple of weeks&quot;, potentially during December&#x27;s The Game Awards.

NCsoft head Taekjin Kim and Sony&#x27;s Jim Ryan signed this partnership, with the companies now set to &quot;collaborate in various global business fields, including mobile&quot; together.


While no specifics were mentioned, the two companies stated they are &quot;evaluating a range of potential opportunities with an aim to foster strategic synergy&quot;. This will include leveraging NCsoft&#x27;s &quot;technological prowess&quot; as well as Sony&#x27;s &quot;global leadership in the entertainment field&quot;.

                              <span>They’re not that good:
Security researchers Jesse D’Aguanno and Timo Teräs write that, with varying degrees of reverse-engineering and using some external hardware, they were able to fool the Goodix fingerprint sensor in a Dell Inspiron 15, the Synaptic sensor in a Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and the ELAN sensor in one of Microsoft’s own Surface Pro Type Covers. These are just three laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we’ve reviewed in the last few years. It’s likely that most Windows PCs with fingerprint readers will be vulnerable to similar exploits...</span>

Recently, the Gateway API announced its v1.0 GA release, marking a huge milestone for the project.
Along with stabilizing some of the core functionality in the API, a number of exciting new experimental features have been added.
Backend TLS Policy
BackendTLSPolicy is a new Gateway API type used for specifying the TLS configuration of the connection from the Gateway to backend Pods via the Service API object.
It is specified as a Direct PolicyAttachment without defaults or overrides, applied to a Service that accesses a backend, where the BackendTLSPolicy resides in the same namespace as the Service to which it is applied.

                              <span>Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games are facing a class-action lawsuit over the removal of purchased in-game currencies from accounts when a game&#x27;s online features are taken offline.

The lawsuit (as spotted by Axios) was filed by J.A., a minor, and his mother, acting as his representative and next friend, to the federal court of Northern District of California on 17th November.

In the lawsuit, Take-Two and 2K&#x27;s annual sports franchises NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and PGA Tour 2K are named for offering in-game upgrades which require in-game (virtual) currency. The virtual currency can be bought with real-world money.

In a statement, Fishlabs parent company Plaion (itself owned by Embracer) confirmed a &quot;restructuring&quot; at the studio &quot;expected to impact around 50 positions&quot;. 

&quot;Despite exhaustive efforts to avoid downsizing, the lack of approval and therefore financing for the studio&#x27;s unannounced project (also referred to as &quot;Project Black&quot;) has made this step unavoidable,&quot; a spokesperson said today. &quot;The remaining team will continue to work on the existing co-development projects in partnership with other Plaion and Embracer Group studios.

Earlier this month, Naughty Dog announced a remastered and native PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2. Along with souped up visuals for the base game, this upcoming release will also have a few other bells and whistles including cut content in the form of &#x27;Lost Levels&#x27; for players to experience. These Lost Levels will be Sewers, Jackson Party and Boar Hunt.


Meanwhile, almost in tandem with The Last of Us Part 2&#x27;s remastered release, production on the second season of HBO&#x27;s adaptation is set to kick off early next year. While we know the second season of the show will not encompass the entirety of The Last of Us Part 2&#x27;s narrative, the series&#x27; creator has said &quot;at least one element&quot; of the previously mentioned cut content is &quot;planned for the show&quot;.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s customer support team has been responding to negative Starfield reviews on Steam.


Starfield had a strong start, becoming the &quot;biggest Bethesda game launch&quot; of all time. Those numbers rose over the first few days of release, with Starfield&#x27;s concurrent player count previously beating Skyrim&#x27;s concurrent player record on Steam. 


But despite these initial player numbers, Starfield currently sits with a &#x27;Mixed&#x27; review status on Steam. At the time of writing, 69 percent of the game&#x27;s 80,365 reviews on the platform are positive. The rest are, obviously, less generous.

                              <span>Larian Studios says it&#x27;s aiming to release Patch 5 for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 later this week. The update will include a fix for performance issues in Act 3, Astarion&#x27;s kisses, and more. 
Since Patch 4 was released at the beginning of the month, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 players have experienced slowdown in Act 3. The performance issues were introduced in the patch, Larian stated on X (née Twitter), and resulted in tag crimes like theft and violence being tagged as &quot;eternally-active&quot;, regardless of whether or not players were spotted by NPCs.
Larian director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the slowdown is caused by a specific bug in Moonrise Towers during Act 2. Patch 5 will address this and &quot;so much more,&quot; Douse wrote, when it hopefully drops later this week. Mostly I&#x27;m just looking forward to being able to ask Astarion for a kiss and actually receive one.

                              <span>Bungie will now launch its climactic Destiny 2 expansion The Final Shape on 4th June 2024.


The four-month delay was previously leaked following news of job cuts at the studio, and a sense that the game&#x27;s big finale expansion needed more time. Bungie&#x27;s other announced game project Marathon has also reportedly been delayed - and will now launch in 2025.


In a blog post today, Bungie confirmed that The Final Shape did indeed need longer &quot;to become exactly what we want it to be&quot;.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I wanted to share a quick update about Eurogamer, and its future which now looks to lie outside the Reedpop business.


If you&#x27;ve been reading for a while you may know Eurogamer has been around a few years (24!) and spent most of that time as part of the family-run Gamer Network. 


Five years ago, Gamer Network was bought by Reedpop, the pop culture-focused arm of events company Reed Exhibitions, which already ran PAX and New York Comic-Con.

                              <span>NCSoft unveiled new trailers for its upcoming games Project M and LLL at G-Star 2023 which show off new features.

Project M is a narrative thriller which we first saw in June 2022 with a trailer filled with quicktime events reminiscent of Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human. The game looks packed with drama, family, violence, and the supernatural. LLL was announced a few months later in November 2022 and is a sci-fi MMO set in an alternate history which caused modern-day Seoul, the Byzantine Empire and the 23rd century to become entangled with one another.
The trailer for Project M gives us a look at a new environment, a brightly lit but dilapidated theme park. There&#x27;s also some stealth and action sections which aren&#x27;t driven by quicktime events, so there&#x27;ll be some variety in the game&#x27;s combat.

The company, the parent of Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse, called this a &quot;difficult&quot; decision to make.

This includes its Story Mode, a feature which was promised as part of Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds&#x27; initial Indiegogo campaign. 


The studio slipped this news in rather casually towards the end of a recent blog update about the game, where it detailed its upcoming DLC characters.

When discussing her wider portfolio, McDonnell said she often takes inspiration from her own experiences when writing characters. &quot;Most of my stories start with whatever funk or crisis or feeling I&#x27;m living in, then I figure out how to explore that through speculative fiction,&quot; McDonnell shared.

The recruitment advertisement, which went live earlier this week, makes a clear connection between the success of the sci-fi shooter&#x27;s multiplayer game and the ability to &quot;work directly&quot; with the Halo community and players who make their own maps and assets in its map-making mode, Forge.

&quot;In this role you&#x27;ll design, implement, and manage playlists that align with the needs of Halo Infinite. You&#x27;ll work with partner teams to ensure content (maps and modes) is properly represented in our playlists and aligns with scheduled game events,&quot; the ad explains.

                              <span>UK games trade body Ukie&#x27;s diversity initiative, #RaisetheGame, has partnered with recruitment agency Amiqus to launch Empower Up, a &quot;comprehensive platform to equip game companies of all sizes with the knowledge, frameworks, guidance, and resources they need to establish, improve, or grow their equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) policies&quot;.

The companies say that &quot;at the heart of Empower Up&quot; is a practical Health Check tool that companies can use to benchmark where they are &quot;on their EDI journey&quot;, as well as provide further advice and guidance on how to move forward. 

&quot;Empower Up is suitable for all games companies, wherever they are on their EDI journey,&quot; Ukie says. &quot;For those looking to gain more understanding about what EDI is and why it’s important, the Intro To EDI section provides an overview. It also provides a summary of different Diversity Characteristics and Under-Represented Groups, along with some specific advice and guidance on each.

                              <span>Nier series producer Yosuke Saito has confirmed that while &quot;[director] Yoko Taro is alive&quot;, new Nier games will be released.

In an interview with 4Gamer.net (日本語) and shared by Genki, Saito said that while another Nier game would be coming, the duo was currently working on a &quot;separate&quot; project, and teased that we can expect to hear more about that unannounced game next year.

The news came via &quot;a meeting to talk incessantly about the production of Nier Automata&quot; presentation at the Korean video game show G-STAR 2023 – yes, I love the title, too – in which Saito talked about the development of the original game and hinted at what lay ahead for the fan-favourite series.

                              <span>The Division: Heartland has been rated in Taiwan.

The free-to-play third-person action-shooter spin-off was announced in May 2021 and was initially set to release in 2021-22. Ubisoft has since been taciturn about the game&#x27;s release window, but the rating – which was published earlier this month – intimates that we could be getting a firm release date soon.

Because of &quot;violence, inappropriate language&quot;, and &quot;anti-society&quot; leanings – make of that what you will – the shooter has been awarded a PG-15 rating on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.

According to the letter, a surveillance program now known as Data Analytical Services (DAS) has for more than a decade allowed federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to mine the details of Americans’ calls, analyzing the phone records of countless people who are not suspected of any crime, including victims. Using a technique known as chain analysis, the program targets not only those in direct phone contact with a criminal suspect but anyone with whom those individuals have been in contact as well...</span>

                              <span>Valve boss Gabe Newell has been ordered to appear in court as part of an antitrust lawsuit filed by Wolfire Games.

As first reported by our friends at GamesIndustry.biz, Wolfire Games – which filed the order earlier this month – brought an antitrust lawsuit against the megacorp back in 2021. Whilst Newell requested a remote deposition due to health concerns, admitting he has &quot;structured his life to minimise exposure to possible COVID-19 transmission&quot;, Wolfire insists that there is &quot;insubstantial evidence to suggest that he is at particularised risk of serious illness&quot; and wants him there in person. 

Wolfire further asserts that Newell needs to attend in person because it believes he is &quot;uniquely positioned to testify on all aspects of [Valve&#x27;s] business strategy&quot;, and the company wants to &quot;adequately assess Newell&#x27;s credibility&quot;.

According to content creator Gabe Follower, the prototype – called Terror Strike – was &quot;accidentally compiled&quot; and added to the Counter-Strike update, showing how the zombie game&#x27;s DNA lies firmly in the mod for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and was developed using CS assets, including Counter-Strike weapons.

The files were quickly pulled from the 22nd November update, but not quickly enough to stop them being yoinked and then distributed publicly.

                              <span>A rating for Prison Architect 2 has popped up in Korea.

At the time of writing, a sequel to Introversion Software&#x27;s wildly popular management sim has not been formally announced, yet Prison Architect 2 has been rated as suitable for &quot;juvelines&quot; by Korea&#x27;s Game Rating and Administration Committee. 

Interestingly, the link that once led to the rating is now dead, and the game doesn&#x27;t turn up if you search for it, either in English or Korean. So make of that what you will.

                              <span>A Switch rating for Borderlands Collection: Pandora&#x27;s Box has popped up in Germany.

Right now, the collection is only available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and has not yet been confirmed for Switch, which only received a Borderlands 3 port back in October, four years after the threequel was released on other platforms.

Interestingly, it was submitted for classification quite some time ago – the website says Pandora&#x27;s Box was given its 14+ rating back in August – but it&#x27;s only now come to the attention of the eagle-eyed folks on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit and has yet to be added to the Nintendo eShop.

                              <span>Activision wants to recommend games to you based on the livestreams you watch.

According to a patent filed in July and published publicly just last week – snappily entitled &quot;systems and methods of dynamically modifying video game content based on non-video game content being concurrently experienced by a user&quot; – Activision wants to keep track of what you watch and use that data to make personalised recommendations to you.

As spotted by Exputer, this would make a typically passive viewing experience more interactive, and could even mean &quot;generating&quot; a game just for you or modifying an existing game&#x27;s content to better suit the kinds of things you like to watch in livestreams.

                              <span>Back in August, as part of this year&#x27;s TennoCon celebrations, Warframe developer Digital Extremes unveiled Whispers in the Walls, the next (and extremely weird) chapter in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter&#x27;s ongoing saga. And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion&#x27;s release, including confirmation it&#x27;ll arrive alongside cross-save support.


Whispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It&#x27;s an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos, and one that&#x27;ll reveal the &quot;proverbial big bang&quot; that kicked off every event in Warframe.


In terms of enemies, the labyrinthine laboratory plays host to a much-expanded Necramech faction, including new Necrodogs, that players can battle using Whispers in the Walls&#x27; new Grimoire, a secondary weapon capable of flinging pages of devastating Void. But that&#x27;s not the expansion&#x27;s only new threat; at certain points, players will find themselves whisked away from the gothic gloom of Albrecht&#x27;s lab to a vast Eldritch desert that serves as the home of the mysterious Man in the Wall. Here, they&#x27;ll encounter a second new faction, the Murmur, nightmarish multi-limbed creatures resembling tech-infused biblical angels.

                              <span>Super Mario RPG&#x27;s recently released Switch remake is a lovely thing, freshening up a much-loved classic for a new generation, while ensuring its core remains faithful enough that it can deliver a wonderful blast of nostalgia for long-time fans. And it turns out that faithfulness runs deep, with players having discovered it restores a fun little easter egg that was cut from the original version during the localisation process for release outside of Japan.


More specifically, the 1996 Japanese version of Super Mario RPG contained a cute - if ultimately fairly pointless - sequence that would trigger if players entered the cheat code &#x27;Down, Up, Right, Left, L, R, L, R, B&#x27; on the pause screen.


Rather than showering players with treats to make the experience a little easier or give everyone a massive head, as cheat codes tended to do at the time, entering Super Mario RPG&#x27;s sequence of button presses would instead cause Toad to materialise and ponder what the secret code you just entered could possibly have done.

The Squid Nebula is shown in blue, indicating doubly ionized oxygen—­which is when you ionize your oxygen once and then ionize it again just to make sure. (In all seriousness, it likely indicates a low-mass star nearing the end of its life).

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                              <span>Ubisoft has said that pop-up adverts seen last night within Assassin&#x27;s Creed games have now been disabled, and were the result of a technical error. 


The adverts, which promoted other games in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series that are currently on sale for Black Friday, were spotted by some players yesterday evening, prompting complaints online.


Players reported seeing the adverts pop-up when they paused the action to load the in-game map. One example shared on X, formerly Twitter, shows an advert for 20 percent off Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage fill the screen when a player accesses the map within Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.

The developer shared this milestone as part of a Thanksgiving post, stating it was grateful to everyone who had visited Arcadia Bay with Max and Chloe and experienced Life is Strange&#x27;s time maniplating and emotionally charged story.


&quot;We want to thank each and every one of you for playing,&quot; the account wrote, with an accompanying reel showing moments from the game (which made me get a little choked up, I won&#x27;t lie).

Luke&#x27;s stream ended abruptly last night as sirens were heard in the background, and as he received a call warning him that police were outside. 


&quot;Oh nice,&quot; he said. &quot;Alright I&#x27;ve gotta go, now these assholes have swatted my house.&quot;

                              <span>Original Bayonetta director Hideki Kamiya suspects many of his ideas for the series will be going to the grave with him. 


Kamiya&#x27;s comments come as part of his most recent YouTube video, where the PlatinumGames co-founder said he fully expects the Bayonetta franchise to continue without him. 


&quot;I worked on Bayonetta 1, 2, 3 and Origins,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ve talked about this in various interviews, that the Bayonetta series would consist of a total of nine episodes, and that I wanted to grow the franchise as the Bayonetta &#x27;Saga&#x27;, but it seems like I may have to take the full saga to the grave with me.&quot;

                              <span>American Truck Simulator rumbles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has announced it&#x27;ll be making its next stop, this time in the state of Kansas - the destination of its newest paid expansion - next Thursday, 30th November. Plus, its substantial 1.49 update - which adds a dynamic night sky, the moon, HDR skyboxes, and more - is out now.


Kansas was confirmed to be the focus of American Truck Simulator &#x27;s next, post-Oklahoma expansion back in February, bringing the tally of explorable states in the game up to 14, joining the previously released California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma.


American Truck Simulator&#x27;s rendition of Kansas - or the Sunflower State, if you will - promises to give potential visitors and their hefty transportation a tour of the area&#x27;s &quot;native grasslands, streams, abundant blue skies, and green grassland vistas&quot;. You can see some of that across copious screenshots in SCS&#x27; launch date announcement post.

                              <span>As families come together to gorge on turkey/give thanks for Doctor Who being 60, what better way to mark the occasion than with a bit of a (spacey) freebie from the Epic Games Store, specifically in the form of Deliver Us Mars?


Deliver Us Mars, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is this year&#x27;s sequel to developer KeokeN Interactive&#x27;s 2018 sci-fi puzzle-adventure Deliver Us the Moon. For this secound outing, players step into the massive space clogs of an astronaut, Kathy, as she travels to the red planet in search of her missing father and technology that might just help save Earth from ecological disaster. 


What follows is a mix of first-person platforming and puzzle solving reminiscent of its predecessor, although it doesn&#x27;t appear Deliver Us Mars enjoyed quite as positive a critical reception as the fist game. Still, free is free, so if some cerebral spacey excitement appeals, you&#x27;ll want to be pointing yourself toward the Epic Games Store over the next seven days.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss this year&#x27;s various video game remakes and remasters, including the recently-announced The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which is headed to PlayStation 5 in January.
While TLOU2 was launched on PS4, it&#x27;s still just three years on from that game&#x27;s arrival. How do we feel about there already being a &quot;Remaster&quot;, and are its DVD extra-style additions worth a £10 upgrade? 
We also discuss some of the other remakes to arrive (again) this year, including the excellent new versions of Dead Space and Resident Evil 4. It&#x27;s good these games are finding new audiences, but are we in danger of focusing too much on the past, and on safe, known franchises? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer&#x27;s Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

Most Kremlin-backed groups take pains to fly under the radar; Gamaredon doesn’t care to.

Welcome to another edition of the SIG spotlight blog series, where we
highlight the incredible work being done by various Special Interest
Groups (SIGs) within the Kubernetes project. In this edition, we turn
our attention to SIG Testing,
a group interested in effective testing of Kubernetes and automating
away project toil. SIG Testing focus on creating and running tools and
infrastructure that make it easier for the community to write and run
tests, and to contribute, analyze and act upon test results.
To gain some insights into SIG Testing, Sandipan
Panda spoke with Michelle Shepardson,
a senior software engineer at Google and a chair of SIG Testing, and
Patrick Ohly, a software engineer and architect at
Intel and a SIG Testing Tech Lead.

Tekken 8 developer Bandai Namco has also listed 16 GB RAM as its recommended memory requirement. While this does seem to be along the standard line for PC games today, it is still twice that of Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s memory recommendations.

But you&#x27;ll actually need two phones to play it - one to act as a controller, while a separate mobile device needs to have the Amico Controller app installed and be connected to the same wireless network.
Alternatively, Intellivision states the official Amico hardware controllers are compatible with the app via Bluetooth, except they haven&#x27;t been released yet and the company didn&#x27;t specify when customers can expect them.

The report, conducted by Atomik Research for SuperScale&#x27;s Good Games Don&#x27;t Die and shared by Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz, was based on interviews with 500 game developers, from both here in the UK and across the pond in the US. 


The report stated the majority of mobile games reached peak revenue within the first 12 months of their release. While 76 percent reach their peak revenue in the first year, only four percent peak in the second year of release.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 developer Sledgehammer Games has said it is &quot;investigating&quot; an exploit that allows players to wriggle around on the floor while prone at fast speeds.


It leaves you looking like some kind of human Call of Duty snake, but it also leaves you able to zoom around while lying prone - a very handy tactic for winning gunfights.


Now, Sledgehammer has taken notice and dubbed Call of Duty snaking as a PC exploit to be looked at further. &quot;We&#x27;re investigating an exploit that allows players to sprint while appearing in the prone animation,&quot; the developer wrote on the official CODUPdates account on X, formerly Twitter.

                              <span>Andrzej Sapkowski may have penned The Witcher novels, which in turn inspired both CD Projekt Red&#x27;s video game series and Netflix&#x27;s TV adaptation, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the streaming service ever listened to his feedback.


While attending Vienna Comic Con, Sapkowski was asked about the various adaptations that have stemmed from his original works. Speaking with Cerealkillers, the author said that every visual adaptation of his The Witcher series was &quot;strange&quot; for him to see, because as a writer he only uses his words.


&quot;My raw material when I work, it&#x27;s only letters. I do not describe pictures. I don&#x27;t see any pictures. I use the letters only because I know that my reader will see in the book the letters only, not the pictures. So I have to do with my letters to make the reader imagine the picture, not the other way around... so every [visual] adaptation, it&#x27;s simply strange for me,&quot; he explained.

                              <span>The world has been given a tiny glimpse into the uber-secretive world of Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar North thanks to a fascinating new blog from former technical director Obbe Vermeij, who, in just a few short weeks, has shed light on the studio&#x27;s cancelled spy game Agent, discussed a zombie game abandoned by the company after it was deemed to be too &quot;depressing&quot;, and more.


Vermeij served as technical director at Rockstar North from 1995 (when the studio was still known as DMA Design) to 2009, meaning his time at the company spanned the creation of Grand Theft Auto as a series right through to Grand Theft Auto 4 and its DLC.


Since launching his blog earlier this month, Vermeij has been sharing anecdotes covering a number of Rockstar games, touching on everything from the company&#x27;s streaming tech for Grand Theft Auto 3 - which struggled enough that the art team was forced to shove a building in the middle of a long stretch of Portland road to ensure players wouldn&#x27;t run out of city while loading continued - to early efforts at implementing multiplayer in GTA 3.

                              <span>Following some initial rumblings earlier this year, a new report has lend further credence to suggestions 2024&#x27;s Call of Duty game will be another entry in the Black Ops series, this one now said to be taking place in the Gulf War.


Word that Call of Duty 2024 would be a new Black Ops game first surfaced back in February, when it was claimed next year&#x27;s series entry was being developed by Treyarch under the codename Cerberus. Furher evidence backing this up arrived in July, when actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford shared a Facebook post referencing Black Ops and claiming his likeness would be used for next year&#x27;s main character, &quot;Ratcliff&quot;.


And that brings us to a new report from Windows Central which, citing &quot;multiple sources familiar with Activision&#x27;s plans&quot;, says next year&#x27;s Call of Duty &quot;is indeed Black Ops&quot;. The publication also claims the game will attempt to &quot;explore a nuanced narrative of the Gulf War, with a critical focus on different participants within the conflict.&quot;

                              <span>With winter looming, THQ Nordic has seized this most seasonally appropriate opportunity to showcase more of its upcoming South Park: Snow Day, with its latest trailer revealing a smattering of new gameplay for the co-op adventure.


South Park: Snow Day was initially teased back in August last year, making a sneaky post-credits appearance at the very end of THQ Nordic&#x27;s 2022 showcase. One year on, it made a second showcase appearance, this time to confirm its title, unveil its decidedly un-TV-show like 3D visual style, and reveal a handful of other details.


We know, for instance, that South Park: Snow Day (which is being developed by The Blackout Club studio Question) is a co-op adventure in which up to four players - along with familiar faces including Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny - enjoy their day away from school by battling through the snow-blanketed South Park streets on a quest to save the world.

                              <span>Sony must face a £5bn lawsuit that alleges gamers have been repeatedly overcharged for PlayStation products, following a decision this week by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal.
The lawsuit was originally filed in August 2022 by ex-managing director of Which? UK Alex Neill, on behalf of UK PlayStation users.
Neill&#x27;s application for a collective proceedings order against Sony accuses the PlayStation maker of anti-competitive practices such as imposing unfair terms on developers and forcing prices up for consumers.

                              <span>There&#x27;s some bad news if you were hoping to get your Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 fix anytime soon; publisher Focus Entertainment has announced a substantial delay for the third-person sci-fi shooter, which is now expected to arrive in the second half of next year.


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - which follows the continuing adventures of original series protagonist Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus (once again voiced by Mark Strong) - was originally due to launch in &quot;winter&quot; this year, but Focus has now announced a delay as part of an &quot;update on execution of the line-up and partnerships&quot;.


As per Focus&#x27; revised release schedule, Space Marine 2 - which is being developed by Saber Interactive - will now launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC in the &quot;second half of 2024&quot;, with Focus saying the delay will &quot;provide the time needed to properly polish the game and to ensure the best possible experience&quot;.

                              <span>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, one fan has released an animated short of Castle Town reimagined as a setting in a Studio Ghibli film.
YouTuber RwanLink said the environment and characters took four months to make in Unreal Engine 5, and totals to over 600 hours of work whilst also in a full-time job.
The short video follows Link as he leaves Kokiri Forest for Hyrule Castle, and we bump into some familiar faces such as Malon, the Happy Mask Shop Owner, and even Skyward Sword&#x27;s Fi skating around the Master Sword.

                              <span>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has claimed Google offered him what &quot;seemed like a crooked arrangement&quot; in order to persuade the company to release Fortnite in the Google Play Store rather than through its own website.
Sweeney made the statement when he took to the witness stand yesterday in the ongoing trial between Epic and Google.
As reported by AP, Sweeney described a meeting between himself and Google at the latter&#x27;s headquarters to discuss an agreement which would see Epic release Fortnite on the Play Store. &quot;It seemed like a crooked arrangement,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;Google was proposing a series of side deals which seemed designed to convince Epic not to compete against them,&quot; he continued.

The DLCs will mark the final release from Mimimi before it closes as it announced back in August. At the time, studio co-founders  Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth revealed it was working on a &quot;big content drop&quot; for Shadow Gambit, which we know now is in the form of two expansion.
Each expansion will include a new playable character with unique abilities, a new island to explore, and a story campaign told across six new missions. The new characters can be used in most of the main game&#x27;s missions and aren&#x27;t limited to the DLC missions, Mimimi stated.

                              <span>Ubisoft has given a brief update on its missing in action Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has had a troubled development and still lacks a formal release date. 


Originally announced back in 2020 for release the following year, work on the game was rebooted when development dragged on and the project was then moved from Ubisoft Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.


Updates from the project have since been scarce, though Ubisoft broke cover last night to state that the game was still very much in development and had recently &quot;passed an important internal milestone&quot;.

                              <span>Activision has said its new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has broken multiple player engagement records, without providing any specific player numbers. 


&quot;Just two weeks in, Modern Warfare 3 has already set records with the highest engagement in the new Modern Warfare trilogy,&quot; states a post by the Call of Duty account on X, formerly Twitter.


These records include the fact Modern Warfare 3 owners are playing &quot;more hours per player overall&quot; and &quot;campaign players [are] putting in more time per player&quot; than in the modern Modern Warfare 1 and 2.

                              <span>GameMaker, a series of cross-platform engines for game developers, has ditched its subscription model for non-commercial purposes, hobbyists and indie developers.
GameMaker will now be free for anyone using its software non-commercially on all non-console platforms. Creator and indie subscriptions have been replaced with a one-time fee of $100, meanwhile, which grants a commercial license and enables exports to desktop and mobile platforms.
The change appears to have been prompted by the recent and controversial changes Unity announced for its pricing model, which would introduce a fee for developers per game install. The plan was met with anger from indie developers, causing Unity to walk back significantly on its proposed changes.

This sci-fi third-person shooter was developed during the N64 heyday of British studio Rare, and launched during the four-year period the company also released classics such as GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64 and Perfect Dark. 


It may not have the brand power of some of those, but it&#x27;s still a solid arcade-inspired adventurey shooter with a lengthy single-player and a deathmatch-style multiplayer.

                              <span>Conveniently timed to coincide with the launch of this year&#x27;s Steam autumn sale, Blizzard has announced a free trial week for Diablo 4 - plus discounts across all versions of the game - starting today and running until 28th November.


Diablo 4&#x27;s free trial lets players dip their toes into the world of Sanctuary, and includes full access to co-op and crossplay, but there&#x27;s one major limitation: progression is capped at level 20. Exactly how much playtime that equates to is a little unclear, especially given Diablo 4&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Blessing event is also now live, boosting XP and Gold by 35% until 27th November.


Regardless, Blizzard says all trial progress can be carried over to the full game should your time with Diablo 4 convince you to make a purchase. And there&#x27;s additional incentive to do so, considering all versions of the game are currently discounted by 40% as part of the Steam  sale.

Official word that a new Subnautica game was on the way first surfaced in April last year, when developer Unknown Worlds - the studio behind the series&#x27; original 2018 entry and its 2021 follow-up Subnautica: Below Zero - announced it was seeking a senior narrative designer to &quot;help shape the next game in the Subnautica universe&quot;.


And now, a little over 18 months later, the new Subnautica has made an appearance in publisher Krafton&#x27;s slate of upcoming releases, as shared via the deeply unsexy means of financial report PowerPoint slide presentation (thanks Rock Paper Shotgun). It&#x27;s set to launch in &quot;1H25&quot; - the first half of 2025 - but, beyond that, details are limited.

                              <span>Back in September, Dave the Diver studio Mintrocket unveiled Nakwon: Last Paradise, a 16-player stealth-survival extraction game set on the streets of Seoul amid an undead apocalypse, and now - with a public pre-alpha playtest looming - it&#x27;s shared 22 minutes of gameplay.


Nakwon is a game of two parts; the primary focus is Scouting, requiring players (either solo or in a team of two) to leave the titular safe zone in order to scavenge for resources out in the city. Being a PvPvE experience, the threats outside are twofold: there&#x27;re the zombies - which can&#x27;t be killed, meaning stealth is key to survival - alongside other human scavengers, who&#x27;ll either need to be avoided or set upon with makeshift weaponry (firearms are a scare commodity).


Players can come and go as they like, meaning once they&#x27;re satisfied with their haul, they can return to the safe zone, where Nakwon&#x27;s more simulation-focused activities occur. Here, hard-gained resources can be sold for money, which is used to increase Citizen Grades and secure better priveliges and benefits. &quot;Every day, you must decide whether to go out for Scouting or staying inside,&quot; Mintrocket explained previously. &quot;But, you must consistently secure more food to avoid starvation and make the best choice whenever an unexpected event occurs.&quot;

                              <span>Valve has released a fresh Steam update that makes it even simpler to discover games supported by different controllers.


While it has been easy to find Steam games that support Xbox controllers, Valve has now built upon this function to make finding games that support both the DualSense and its predecessor the DualShock a doddle.


As part of an upgraded controller-friendly hub, Steam users can explore games by controller type when browsing the vast library. It will &quot;default&quot; to the controller any given user played with most recently, but there is also the option to adjust the filters.

                              <span>Signal has had the ability to manually authenticate another account for years. iMessage is getting it:
The feature is called Contact Key Verification, and it does just what its name says: it lets you add a manual verification step in an iMessage conversation to confirm that the other person is who their device says they are. (SMS conversations lack any reliable method for verification­—sorry, green-bubble friends.) Instead of relying on Apple to verify the other person’s identity using information stored securely on Apple’s servers, you and the other party read a short verification code to each other, either in person or on a phone call. Once you’ve validated the conversation, your devices maintain a chain of trust in which neither you nor the other person has given any private encryption information to each other or Apple. If anything changes in the encryption keys each of you verified, the Messages app will notice and provide an alert or warning...</span>

This is the moment Fortnite will transition out of its current OG guise, which has seen all-time record engagement as the game&#x27;s original map returned, and into something brand new.


The Big Bang will take place live within Fortnite on Saturday 2nd December at 7pm UK time (that&#x27;s 2pm Eastern, or 11am Pacific), with online leaks suggesting a huge music star will be making a surprise in-game appearance.

The action-adventure game is set to release on 2nd February, 2024, and the test represents a &quot;smaller, specific section of the campaign and will not be representative of the full/final experience&quot; Warner Bros. stated.
The alpha test will take place across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S from 3pm UK time on 30th November to 8am UK time on 5th December. If you&#x27;re interested in getting involved, you&#x27;ll need to register on the official Suicide Squad website.

                              <span>Court documents from the ongoing Epic Games vs Google antitrust case reveal the internet giant wanted to take over the Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer, and was willing to work with shareholder Tencent to complete a buyout.
A quick reminder of how we got here: in August 2020, Epic implemented a method to circumvent Apple and Google fees on in-game payments in the iOS and Android versions of Fortnite. The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, and the case against Apple was settled in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts. Earlier this year, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties.
Now Epic is back in court to wage its case against Google. While the court battle between Epic and Apple brought us the bizarre moment in which banana mascot Peely&#x27;s decency was questioned in (apologies, in the tuxedo he&#x27;s known as Agent Peely), so far the proceedings with Google have been revealing in a slightly different way.

The Alan Wake 2 developer has just shared the knitting pattern for Saga Anderson&#x27;s rather fetching Nordic-inspired jumper (which was made by her mother, you know).


The cosy jumper features a festive pattern, which includes a deer and tree motif. It is ideal for this time of year, when the nights are longer and - where I live, at least - quite a lot colder.

To ensure protection against these types of exploits, TAG urges users and organizations to keep software fully up-to-date and apply security updates as soon as they become available.

The studio posted an updated roadmap to Steam, and Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen expanded on the decision to delay the DLC in a new developer diary.
&quot;We are committed to bringing the marketed DLC content to you,&quot; Hallikainen wrote, &quot;but it will not be landing in the originally promoted schedule.&quot; Instead, the studio is focusing on improving the game&#x27;s performance on PC before working on the delayed console release and DLC packs.

Krueger said the decision to move on was a &quot;very difficult&quot; one, but he was confident Housemarque&#x27;s &quot;brightest chapter&quot; is still ahead. 


&quot;During my 14 years at Housemarque, I&#x27;ve been incredibly fortunate to work on one dream project after another, and had the privilege of working alongside some truly talented and wonderful people along the way,&quot; Kruger wrote in a statement announcing his depature on the company&#x27;s website.

Users will be able to play up to an hour of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. 


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s trial, meanwhile, offers a more generous two hours of play time (although, given how vast the game actually is, this is really just a smidgen of the full release).

Development of the KOTOR remake has been rocky since it was first announced, and last week Lars Wingefors, CEO of Saber owner Embracer, refused to comment on the state of the game during an earnings presentation.
In response to this, Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb has stated the game is &quot;not being worked on right now&quot; according to sources close to the project. &quot;Full stop, this game is not being worked on in any way at any studio.&quot;

The company has now fully acquired nDreams for a total enterprise value close to $110m.

Bret Robbins made the statement in an interview with Windows Central, where he discussed the reception to Immortals of Aveum, the subsequent layoffs at the studio, and putting the game onto subscription services. 
Immortals of Aveum released on 22nd August 2023, which meant it was competing with the likes of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 (which &quot;no one anticipated&quot; would be so successful, Robbins said) and Armored Core 6, with Starfield releasing soon after. The studio knew Immortals&#x27; release date was in a packed window, and Robbins said &quot;trying to create awareness for us [as a new studio and IP] was really, really difficult&quot;.

                              <span>Insomniac Games&#x27; take on Wolverine is reportedly set to release in 2025 as a PlayStation 5 exclusive. 


That&#x27;s according to internet tipster DanielRPK , who is perhaps best known for their scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies.


DanielRPK said the upcoming Wolverine game will be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a much darker and more violent game than the studio&#x27;s Spider-Man titles. Additionally, the tipster has said it will feature Madripoor, Marvel&#x27;s fictional island often associated with X-Men stories (which popped up in the MCU relatively recently in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier TV series).

&quot;The Bathhouse looked a little decrepit, so I decided to touch things up and made everything look better,&quot; ItsJinosuar explained on the game&#x27;s subreddit page.

As spotted by the Nintendo Switch subreddit, the collection – in which players &quot;traverse 2D pixellated environments using gadgets and vehicles to defeat small cartoony creatures&quot; – looks to be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.
Sadly, there&#x27;s no mention of an Xbox-flavoured release just yet.

                              <span>Two as yet unannounced Borderlands games have appeared on the LinkedIn profile of a former Gearbox employee.

A former studio technical director who had previously worked at Lost Boys Interactive on a three-month contract has included references to Borderlands 4 and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderland 2 on their professional profile, even though neither game has been formally confirmed.

In the director&#x27;s own words, they supervised 66 employees across the team to &quot;plan and engineer development on Borderlands 4 UE4&quot; and &quot;Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderland 2 UE4&quot;, as well as a whole of other games in Take-Two&#x27;s considerable portfolio.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has denied claims its upcoming Wonder Woman project will be a live-service game. 

A recent job listing for Warner Bros. and developer Monolith Productions&#x27; upcoming Wonder Woman game sought a &#x27;Lead Software Engineer, Gameplay&#x27;, with &quot;live software product or game&quot; experience listed as a &quot;nice to have&quot;. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, this led some to speculate that Warner Bros. might have been looking to incorporate live service elements in the upcoming title.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has opened a &quot;brand new studio&quot; in Austin, Texas.

Confirmation came via a recruitment advertisement on Activision&#x27;s own website, in which the developer put out a call to recruit an &quot;expert UI engineer&quot; to work on Call of Duty at the new studio.

&quot;Founded in 2002, Infinity Ward is the original studio behind the Call of Duty franchise,&quot; the developer said. &quot;The titles developed by Infinity Ward have won more than 200 &#x27;Game of the Year&#x27; awards and 100 &#x27;Editor&#x27;s Choice&#x27; awards, among many other industry accolades.

                              <span>It looks like PUBG Studios&#x27; upcoming extraction shooter, Project Black Budget, will drop in the second half of 2024.

That&#x27;s according Krafton&#x27;s most recent financial report, which hints that the PvPvE shooter may release on the earlier side of its original 2024-2025 estimate. 

Project Black Budget first came to light in a different Krafton financial report earlier this year, described as a project destined to &quot;challenge ourselves to popularise the extraction shooter genre based on our PUBG production and service experience&quot;.

Numskull worked alongside Taito to &quot;accurately replicate the original 1978 and 1979 arcade cabinets&quot;, which went on sale this time last year. After quite the wait, pre-orders are now winging their way to players in the UK and Europe, and US players should expect their mini-cabinets in the next few weeks.

After signing 78 of the Space Invaders and 79 of the Space Invaders Part 2 cabinets – they released in 1978 and 1979 respectively – Nishikado spent a little time putting the machines through their paces, as captured in the brief clip below:

                              <span>Riot Games is rolling back changes it had planned to make to Riot IDs following a revolt from its own community.

Riot had originally intended to migrate all accounts to Riot ID and then restrict the number of times players could amend their IDs, as well as charge them $10 for the privilege of changing their online identifier. 

Now, however, Riot says that in response to community feedback, it has &quot;made some big updates to the plan&quot; and while it is still &quot;moving forward with Riot IDs&quot; – and Summoner names in League of Legends will be retired as planned from 20th November – it is no longer restricting players to one name change every 365 days. It will also now permit players to amend their names for free.

The free trial is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and gives you a chance to sample the opening three chapters for yourself. 

It&#x27;s unclear how long the trial will run for or whether or not your progress will carry on should you decide you like what you see and purchase the full game. You will, however, have to accept EA&#x27;s User Agreement and install the EA app in order to play, and if you decide to pay for any premium content whilst sampling the first three chapters, that won&#x27;t be refunded at the end of the trial.

                              <span>Following a swirl of reports earlier this year suggesting a new version of The Last of Us Part 2 was in the works, Naughty Dog has confirmed a remaster of its survival horror sequel - promising &quot;technological improvements, new modes, and new behind-the-scenes features&quot; - will launch for PlayStation 5 on 19th January 2024.


The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla made comments about &quot;new editions&quot; of The Last of Us Part 2 in July, and a Naughty Dog developer referenced a &quot;remastered&quot; version on LinkedIn in October. A recent PlayStation databse sighting all but gave the game away, but now it&#x27;s official, with Naughty Dog sharing the news in a post on the PlayStation Blog.


The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is a native PlayStation 5 version of the 2020 PS4 original promising various visual enhancements, including increased level-of-detail distances, improved shadow quality, better animation sampling rates, and more. It&#x27;ll feature two graphics modes - Fidelity and Performance, running at 4K and 1440p upscaled to 4K respectively - as well as an unlocked framerate option for VRR TVs.

                              <span>Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early issues with Fortnite&#x27;s newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.


Last month bought the news Epic would be introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a &quot;multi-game ecosystem&quot;. Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its recently released Creative 2.0 tools - and the game&#x27;s latest update means all these experiences now come with age ratings, starting at E for Everyone and going through E10+ up to Teen.


So far, so sensible. The problem is the seemingly haphazard way all this has been implemented in a game that has, up until now, been exclusively rated Teen. Essentially, as of Fortnite&#x27;s latest update, every single bit of content, including all cosmetics, has been given its own age rating - and players are being prevented from accessing Creative mode experiences if they&#x27;re wearing anything flagged as age-inappropriate. It doesn&#x27;t help either, that seemingly benign cosmetics skins - a muscular cartoon cat, for instance - are rated Teen-only and considered unsuitable for children, while others, such as Halloween&#x27;s Michael Myers are rated a-okay for the young &#x27;uns.

                              <span>Seminal first-person shooter Half-Life turns 25 this weekend, and developer Valve is celebrating the occasion with a special anniversary update adding new and restored content, alongside a bunch of other things. Oh, and it&#x27;s made the game free to claim and keep starting today.


Half-Life, for those too young or too in denial to remember, introduced the world to crowbar-toting science nerd Gordon Freeman on 19th November 1998 (Freeman&#x27;s full-life consequences wouldn&#x27;t materialise until sometime later), and anyone looking to relive their memories of those halcyon days now get to do so with some fancy extra bits thrown in.


Starting with the game itself, Half-Life has received a spot of gentle massaging for the modern era. There&#x27;s UI upscaling for higher resolutions (&quot;We built most of this stuff for 640x480 CRTs and apparently some of you have upgraded since then&quot;, says Valve), and it now supports Steam Networking play and proper gamepad config &quot;out of the box&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Aspyr Media has claimed the free cut content DLC it planned to release for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 on Switch was cancelled after objections from a &quot;third-party&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to Axios, which reports Aspyr made the claim as part of an ongoing lawsuit relating to the DLC&#x27;s failure to release, which was filed by a Malachi Mickelonis earlier this year. Mickelonis argues Aspyr and publisher Saber Interactive violated California consumer law by cancelling the DLC, and intentionally deceived purchasers &quot;in order to artificially raise sales revenues...based on qualities and features that the game simply did not possess&quot;.


Aspyr announced it was cancelling Knights of the Old Republic 2&#x27;s Restored Content DLC for Switch - which was to have been based on a popular PC fan mod built from unused story content found in the original game&#x27;s code - back in June, but did not offer an explanation at the time. Now, however, court documents reviewed by Axios quote Aspyr co-CEO Ted Saloch as saying the company &quot;believed it would be able to release the content, but a third party objected and Aspyr was unable to do so.&quot;

This is over the top, but is just another example of the extreme pressure ransomware gangs put on companies after seizing their data. Gangs are now going through the data, looking for particularly important or embarrassing pieces of data to threaten executives with exposing. I have heard stories of executives’ families being threatened, of consensual porn being identified (people regularly mix work and personal email) and exposed, and of victims’ customers and partners being directly contacted. Ransoms are in the millions, and gangs do their best to ensure that the pressure to pay is intense...</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has released a five minute recap video of Final Fantasy 7 Remake ahead of the release of Rebirth.


The video, narrated by flaming beast Red XIII, uses footage from the first game to detail the story so far. The video will also be viewable from the main menu of Rebirth, or you can watch it now in the embed below.


Last week rumours suggested this sort of recap video would be included. They were right, aside from it not being a 17 minute CG film.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what it&#x27;d feel like to be back in 1999, booting up your PSX and popping in a Dark Souls disc, then modder thegreatgramcracker over on Nexus Mods has got you covered with Pixel Souls: Demastered.  
The mod takes Dark Souls Remastered and replaces textures with pixel art based on the original game&#x27;s textures, decreases model quality, and reduces the quality of music and sound effects for a &quot;fun, somewhat cursed, &#x27;retro&#x27; feel,&quot; says thegreatgramcracker.
Demakes and demasters have seen a boom over the past few years, and Dark Souls now joins the likes of other FromSoftware games, including Bloodborne and Elden Ring to receive the lo-fi treatment.

                              <span>Unity has announced the next version of its engine will launch in 2024 and expand on its &quot;responsibly sourced&quot; AI tools.


Unity 6, as announced at yesterday&#x27;s Unite event, will feature performance improvements, accelerated multiplayer game development, and an expansion of the Muse suite of AI tools that&#x27;s now in early access, reports GamesIndustry.biz.


Marc Whitten, president and general manager of Unity Create (the team responsible for the engine), also stated the company is &quot;doubling down on the areas that our creators care about the most, specifically the engine&quot;, following a fallout with developers over its controversial Runtime Fee policy.

                              <span>A PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 has reportedly been added to the console&#x27;s database. 


As spotted by reputable social media account PlayStation Game Size, which is known for sourcing this type of information, a PS5 version of the PlayStation 4 exclusive has been added to the backend of the PlayStation Network. 


While The Last of Us Part 2 was enhanced for PlayStation 5 back in 2021, it was not a native port. Rumours continue to swirl that such an edition is - perhaps - on the cards.

                              <span>A former Nintendo of Japan employee has publically spoken about his time working at the company, calling it a &quot;haven for superhumans and geniuses&quot;, but &quot;hell for an ordinary person&quot; like himself. 
Koichi Miura worked at Nintendo from 2019 to 2023 in game production and is now a freelance CG designer and YouTuber. On Twitter, he wrote about his experience at the company. It&#x27;s rare to see former employees openly talking in an industry which is known for a culture of keeping quiet. 
&quot;Nintendo was a great company,&quot; Miura wrote (as translated by Eurogamer), &quot;but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it lightly to others,&quot; he revealed, due to the sheer amount of talent within the company.

The game&#x27;s previous patch already made changes to increase the challenge of certain bosses. Now further tweaks have been made more broadly.


&quot;It was clear (both from your feedback and our internal findings) that many bosses simply weren&#x27;t posing enough of a challenge, so we have rebalanced some behaviours, as well as their hit points and damage output, to ensure they pose the correct level of difficulty at that point in your journey,&quot; read the patch notes on reddit from Hexworks.

During a recent earnings presentation for the Swedish conglomerate, Wingefors was asked how he was feeling about the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. As a reminder, this remake was first announced back in 2021.


However, rather than providing an update on its fate, the CEO simply stated: &quot;I notice that anything I say to this becomes a headline, so that is my only comment.&quot;

On the PlayStation Direct store in the UK, the Portal costs £199.99 but is currently unavailable.

                              <span>Six month after its initial release, developer Arkane&#x27;s beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received a third major patch, this one primarily focusing on performance improvements and fixes, although it does add a tiny bit of new content in the form of a gun.


Specifically, Redfall players now have access to the Basilisk, an Unrivaled Sniper Rifle that can charge the first bullet in a full magazine with UV power to petrify Vampires. It can be found in locations where Unrivaled items spawn, but is most likely to drop from Bellwether-themed containers in the open-world or vampire nests.


Beyond the Basilisk, Redfall&#x27;s latest update brings bug fixes, balance improvements, and more - as detailed in its patch notes - touching on all aspects of the game, including AI and NPCs, gameplay and missions, heroes, UI, audio, and accessibility. Performance and stability is also a focus, with Arkane promising &quot;various performance fixes related to FPS drops and stuttering.&quot;

Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 will be entering the corporeal realm in the guise of a special Deluxe Edition containing a whole bunch of physical goodies. There&#x27;s the game itself, which comes on three discs for Xbox Series X/S, two discs for PS5, and a single DVD on PC - although that just contains a custom downloader app with an accompanying Steam key.


Moving onto the fancier physical stuff, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Deluxe Edition include three CDs containing the game&#x27;s original soundtrack, a double-sided map, two patches sporting Flaming Fist and Mark of the Absolute designs, a minder flayer poster, plus 32 stickers featuring the game&#x27;s origin characters, some iconic D&amp;D monsters and more.

                              <span>Thomas Waterzooi, developer of cosy painting-based puzzler Please, Touch the Artwork, has announced a sequel is in the works.


Known as Please, Touch the Artwork 2, this upcoming release will continue its predecessor&#x27;s &quot;tradition of immersing players in the captivating realm of a renowned modern artist&quot; as they help a skeleton painter &quot;find his way back home&quot;. 


Where the first game featured art by Piet Mondrian, the artist Waterzooi has focused on for this next release is James Ensor. Players will be able to look for hidden objects within Ensor&#x27;s works when the game releases &quot;early&quot; next year. We will update you with an exact date when we know more.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s remake trilogy will ultimately link up with Advent Children, making the film part of the remake canon.


Tetsuya Nomura, creative director for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, previously told The Guardian the games would link up to Advent Children. Now, speaking to Games Radar, producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed once again the link to Square Enix&#x27;s sequel film and discussed balancing the original story with new revisions.


&quot;We are finally going to link up with Advent Children, that is going to be part of canon,&quot; said Kitase. &quot;The overall storyline, the developments, will not go wildly out in a way that will not add up to Advent Children in the end. I don&#x27;t think anyone wanted that, that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re looking to create here.

Sony has introduced Star Ratings on the PS Store, meaning players can get an idea of how any given game has been received by fellow players before making a purchase. 


As you can see in the screenshots below, the likes of Robocop: Rogue City has a 4.53 star rating on the PlayStation Store. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, meanwhile, only has 2.59.

                              <span>Payday 3&#x27;s release and sales expectations have been discussed by both developer Starbreeze and Embracer, owner of Plaion which co-published the game.


As part of the studio&#x27;s interim report, Starbreeze called Payday 3&#x27;s launch a &quot;milestone&quot; for the company, adding that &quot;both interest in the game and initial sales exceeded [its] expectations&quot;. It then went on to address the reception Payday 3 has since received. 


As previously reported, the game was plagued with matchmaking issues at launch and online-only requirements. Meanwhile, its first promised &#x27;big&#x27; patch received several delays, before finally going live earlier this month.

                              <span>Sonic and Persona publisher Sega has been accused of threatening some of its unionised workers with layoffs, and is now facing an unfair labour practice complaint filed by the Communications Workers of America.
In a new report from Kotaku, on 6th November Sega of America is said to have brought union members into a meeting where they were told of a proposal to &quot;phase out&quot; all temporary employees by February 2024.
The union, Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS-CWA), has filed a complaint with the National Labour Relations Board in response, for making affected employees attend a mandatory meeting to deliver the news rather than bargain with the union as a whole. This could be a violation of the rule which states companies must not negotiate directly with unionised employees instead of with their union.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended Xbox Series X/S release has been delayed again.


Studio Wildcard&#x27;s souped-up version of its dinosaur survival game was meant to launch on Microsoft&#x27;s consoles earlier this week, having previously been expected in August. However, it was delayed at the final hour to an unspecified date, with the studio simply saying it would be released at some point &quot;this week&quot;. At this time, Studio Wildcard said it would update us with a release date before then. 


It has now issued an update but rather than saying &quot;hazaar, it is finally here&quot;, the studio has instead announced another delay. Again, the studio has not put an exact date on when Xbox Series X/S players can expect to see Ark: Survival Ascended arrive on consoles. It has simply said it is now &quot;targeting&quot; a release sometime early next week.

The company is in the midst of a &quot;comprehensive restructuring programme&quot; it announced in June to close studios and cut jobs, to transform the company into &quot;a leaner, stronger, more focused and cash self-sufficient company&quot;.



In the company&#x27;s latest financial report, Wingefors provided an update on restructuring progress, acknowledging the company&#x27;s &quot;first ever quarter-over-quarter reduction in headcount&quot;.

In addition, developer Ubisoft is also going to introduce an optional permadeath mode to the game. This new challenge will be available across all difficulty levels, the studio has said. 


Other than that, details are still quite thin on the ground. The Mirage team is yet to go into more about what either new mode will actually involve, but we do know that it will all be coming next month.

                              <span>Fortnite has added the ability to submit voice recordings when reporting players for violations of the game&#x27;s community rules, which cover instances of abusive or inappropriate behaviour.


Epic Games&#x27; voice reporting system works by recording the last five minutes of game chat audio on a rolling basis, saved to your local device (your PC or game console). Reports of inappropriate behaviour can now include that audio so Epic can hear evidence for itself and swiftly bring down the banhammer.


A detailed technical blog lays out how Epic has come up with a series of policies over when it stores any data you choose to upload, and when voice reporting will be enabled (you can switch it off, but only if you&#x27;re over 18 and playing in parties with friends with similar settings).

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was originally due to launch in 2022 but has been delayed twice since then, most recently following the game&#x27;s controversial gameplay debut, with Warner Bros. announcing it was pushing its release back to 2nd February 2024 in order to make it &quot;the best quality experience for players&quot;.


Eight months on, Suicide Squad has reemerged with a new Insider video series, its initial offering featuring 20 minutes of new gameplay  highlighting traversal mechanics, story elements, and a brief glimpse at the game&#x27;s rendition of Metropolis.

Monolith&#x27;s Wonder Woman was announced during 2021&#x27;s The Game Awards, where it was described a single-player open-world action game. As spotted by Wccftech, however, a recent advert seeking a &#x27;Lead Software Engineer, Gameplay&#x27; for the title on Monolith&#x27;s website has hinted that Warner Bros. may be looking to incorporate live service elements.


The ad, which talks of helping to &quot;deliver a superhero experience as epic as Wonder Woman herself&quot;, includes a list of daily duties associated with the job, alongside essential experience. The relevant part for this story, though, is listed under &quot;nice to haves&quot;, wherein Monolith indicates &quot;experience helping maintain a live software product or game&quot; will be beneficial.

                              <span>Xbox Series X/S owners eager for a Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 release date announcement will have a little longer to wait; developer Larian Studios has confirmed it&#x27;ll be sharing the news during this year&#x27;s Geoff-Keighley-hosted The Game Awards on 8th December.


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s journey to Xbox has, of course, been a bit of a bumpy one; Larian confirmed the acclaimed RPG would be coming Microsoft&#x27;s platform back February, amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive, but noted it had &quot;run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op.&quot;


The developer&#x27;s struggles implementing split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S have continued as the year has gone on, meaning Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 hit PC and PlayStation 5 in August with still no word of an Xbox release date. Eventually, though, after hashing things out with Xbox boss Phil Spencer, Larian confirmed a &quot;solution&quot; had been found: it would be dropping split-screen co-op for Series S until a later date to ensure the RPG hit Xbox before the end of the year.

For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that a large portion of cryptographic keys used to protect data in computer-to-server SSH traffic are vulnerable to complete compromise when naturally occurring computational errors occur while the connection is being established.
[…]
The vulnerability occurs when there are errors during the signature generation that takes place when a client and server are establishing a connection. It affects only keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm, which the researchers found in roughly a third of the SSH signatures they examined. That translates to roughly 1 billion signatures out of the 3.2 billion signatures examined. Of the roughly 1 billion RSA signatures, about one in a million exposed the private key of the host...</span>

As with every release, Kubernetes v1.29 will introduce feature deprecations and removals. Our continued ability to produce high-quality releases is a testament to our robust development cycle and healthy community. The following are some of the deprecations and removals coming in the Kubernetes 1.29 release.
The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it w…</span>

There’s been quite a lot of posts suggesting that not using Kubernetes resource limits might be a fairly useful thing (for example, For the Love of God, Stop Using CPU Limits on Kubernetes or Kubernetes: Make your services faster by removing CPU limits ). The points made there are totally valid – it doesn’t make much sense to pay for compute power that will not be used due to limits, nor to artificially increase latency. This post strives to argue that limits have their legitimate use as well.
As a Site Reliability Engineer on the Grafana Labs platform team, which maintains and improves internal infrastructure and tooling used by the product teams, I primarily try to make Kubernetes upgrades as smooth as possible. But I also spend a lot of time going down…</span>

                              <span>Fortnite, which is currently riding high on the nostalgia of a generation pining for the good old days of five years ago, is extending its Icons line of cosmetics this Friday, 17th November, with the arrival of celebrated F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and his bulldog Roscoe.


Hamilton joins a steadily growing number of noted sports stars and celebrities to be turned into Fortnite skins as part of the Icons series, including Naomi Osaka, Chloe Kim, LeBron James, Neymar Jr., Ariana Grande, Bruno Mars, and Marshmello.


News of Hamilton&#x27;s imminent Fortnite debut was accompanied by a trailer featuring the F1 star wandering around (for some reason) a hall of mirrors then launching himself at a vaguely cat-like superhero outfit before plunging into the world of Fortnite - whereupon the outfit had magically wrapped itself around Hamilton&#x27;s digital frame.

                              <span>If you have played through Alan Wake 2, you will by no doubt be well aware of its musical number. In fact, even if you haven&#x27;t played it, you may also be aware of this particular moment. It has become quite popular online.


Before I go further though, if you have no idea what I am talking about and want to keep as much of Alan Wake 2 a surprise, please head elsewhere now. I do not want to spoil this moment for you. 


OK, so, for those of you who are still with me, I am of course talking about Herald of Darkness by Old Gods of Asgard (AKA Poets of the Fall). It is an absolute tune, and honestly, for me, this song is the best part of Alan Wake 2 (so far at least, I am still not quite finished).

                              <span>The Witcher 3 team has announced a PC mod editor is in the works for Wild Hunt. 


According to the official Witcher social media account, this editor will allow users to create their own experiences in the game &quot;by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content&quot;. 


The team said the mod editor will release some time next year, but did not state any timeframe. It did, however, say when it does release it will be free.

                              <span>Starfield released a little over two months ago on PC and Xbox. However, despite a strong start which saw Starfield become the &quot;biggest Bethesda game launch&quot; of all time, things have tailed off a bit now. In fact, there are currently more people playing Bethesda&#x27;s earlier RPG, Skyrim, over on Steam. 


At the time of writing, there are currently 1610 Steam users playing through 2011&#x27;s Skyrim release, and 13,776 playing 2016&#x27;s Special Edition release. That makes a total of 15,386 Skyrimmers at the present time. 


Both releases combined have a 24-hour player peak of 25,181. If we pop in the VR players as well, that number is higher still.

However, a further list of issues remain under investigation. Further, no widespread frame-rate improvements have been made - a major sticking point of the collection for fans.

                              <span>The new Turok 3 remaster has slipped out earlier than planned in Europe and Australia, following confusion over the game&#x27;s recently-delayed launch date. 


For fans here in Europe, this means the game is available now but contains bugs and lacks quality-of-life improvements which developer Nightdive Studios had intended to remedy in the version of the game set to officially launch elsewhere in two weeks&#x27; time.


For fans elsewhere, such as in the US and Canada, Turok 3 is still due to launch on 30th November with those final tweaks included.

                              <span>Lies of P has received a new update that adds a number of new features and tweaks.


The game will now be a little easier in the early stages, thanks to adjusted attack speed of some monsters in the field and increased stance break duration, more Quartz available earlier on, and the Rising Dodge now a default ability.


Further, balance adjustments have been made to combat, with some weapons now dealing increased damage, plus lighter blades gaining more Guard Regain and heavier blades gaining less.

                              <span>Kaitlyn Dever is reportedly in talks to star as Abby in the second season of The Last of Us. 


That&#x27;s according to a new report by journalist and critic Jeff Sneider, who is known for their film and TV industry scoops. 


Sources familiar with the project said Dever was poised to land the role of Abby thanks to her performance in No One Will Save You, an alien invasion movie which premiered on Hulu back in September. However, she is perhaps better known for role as Amy Antsler in Booksmart.

That&#x27;s according to Ryu Ga Gotoku studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama, who discussed the forthcoming game&#x27;s length in an interview with Japanese website Game Watch (translated by Automaton Media).


&quot;If you go at it continuously, you&#x27;ll get sick, and it won&#x27;t end with just one or two all-nighters,&quot; said Yokoyama of Infinite Wealth.

                              <span>Video games publisher Humble Games has announced layoffs at the company. 


Humble staff members first discussed the layoffs via social media yesterday, as they began looking for new jobs. It&#x27;s still unconfirmed how many people are affected.


In a statement to Videogames.si, which first reported the layoffs, Humble confirmed it had said &quot;goodbye to valued coleagues&quot; and blamed the job losses on industry &quot;trends&quot;.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended - Studio Wildcard&#x27;s controversial Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up of its dinosaur-themed survival game - will no longer launch for Xbox Series X/S on 15th November as originally announced, with the developer now hoping to release the game &quot;later this week&quot;.


Ark: Survival Ascended is no stranger to delays, of course; the full-price upgrade - which is mandatory for players wishing to continue using Wildcard&#x27;s official servers - was originally due to launch in August but was delayed to October after Wildcard admitted it &quot;found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2&quot;.


October did eventually see the release of Ark: Survival Ascended on PC (albeit with a heap of performance problems), but its arrival was accompanied by a further delay for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, with both versions being pushed back to an unspecified point in &quot;November&quot;. Wildcard finally slapped the Xbox version with a 15th November release date last week (the PS5 edition remains TBA), but that&#x27;s now slipped again too.

As per its own recent figures, Digital Bros currently employs 442 people across the company, meaning its newly announced layoffs will likely impact around 130 workers.


The company says it&#x27;s making the cuts after reviewing projects across its development studios and publishing units - which include 505, Assetto Corsa developer Kunos Simulazioni, Puzzle Quest studio Infinity Plus Two, and Terraria mobile developer DR Studios - in order to &quot;align with the evolving competitive environment [and] ensure maximum operational efficiency.&quot;

                              <span>Netflix has confirmed its new stop-motion Pokémon series, Pokémon Concierge, will release on 28th December this year - and there&#x27;s a fresh two-minute trailer to accompanying the news.


Pokémon Concierge, which was announced at the Pokémon Presents showcase back in February, follows the adventures of Haru, a new concierge at a southern island hotel resort for Pokémon. According to Netflix&#x27;s brief blurb for the show, Haru &quot;gradually discovers herself as she and her fellow staff members scramble to attend to the various Pokémon guests.&quot;


&quot;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all [felt like] we are bombarded, under pressure, or that we don&#x27;t want to get up and keep doing what we&#x27;ve been doing and just give up,&quot; Haru&#x27;s voice actor Rena Nōnen said of Pokémon Concierge back in July, &quot;But when you see [the show], it&#x27;s really therapeutic and it makes you want to try and be the best you can be.&quot;

                              <span>If it&#x27;s indies you want, you&#x27;re in luck (as long as you&#x27;re specifically wanting them on Switch); Nintendo has aired another instalment of its Indie World showcase, this time bringing news of a canceled Shantae revival, plague-themed turn-based tactics, a launch date for developer Inkle&#x27;s gorgeous hiking adventure A Highland Song, news of Outer Wilds&#x27; long-awaited Switch release, and more. If you&#x27;re looking to catch up on the excitement, or simply need a reminder, you&#x27;ll find a full breakdown of everything featured during the show below.


Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution sees developer WayForward reviving the cancelled Game Boy Advance instalment of its acclaimed platform series nearly two decades on. To progress through its challenges, players will need to take advantage of Shantae&#x27;s animal transformation abilities, as well as her newfoud power to rearrange stages by switching the foreground and background, and it&#x27;ll also feature a 4-player local battle mode when it launches next year.


Developer Pugstorm&#x27;s Core Keeper is a &quot;mining sandbox adventure&quot; for up to eight players set in an &quot;endless&quot; procedurally generated cave system. There&#x27;s an ancient mystery to be solved, but doing so requires players to hone their survival skills by mining for relics and resources, building bases, growing crops, and hatching pets, as they push further into the subtarrenean world and take on its monsters. This one&#x27;s due to release for Switch in summer 2024.

                              <span>A Highland Song, the beautiful &quot;open platforming&quot; adventure from Heaven&#x27;s Vault and 80 Days developer Inkle, is almost here and will be launching for Switch and PC on 5th December.


A Highland Song tells the story of teenager Moira McKinnon who one day decides to run away from her life of relative seclusion in a small house on the edge of the Scottish Highlands, after recieving a letter from her Uncle Hamish, inviting her to his lighthouse on the coast.


What follows is yet another genre shift for the ever-ambitious Inkle. This time, the acclaimed studio - which has previously dabbled in the likes of visual novels, turn-based strategy, exploratory adventuring, and murder mystery - is combining its acclaimed narrative expertise with 2.5D platforming, as Moira sets off on a journey across the Highlands, where &quot;every peak has a story to tell and every valley echoes with song.&quot;

                              <span>Satisfactory developer Coffee Stain Studios has released a new update for the Early Access game which upgrades it to Unreal Engine 5.


Players have been able to try out this version of the factory-building sim for some time in an Experimental branch, allowing the developers to fine tune performance improvements. Now it&#x27;s available for all on both Steam and the Epic Games Store.


The upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 allows for a more stable foundation for future features, Coffee Stain has said, as well as a new lighting system, vehicle and sound overhauls, and additional granular keybind options.

                              <span>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle, which also includes three months of Nintendo Switch Online. 


It&#x27;s set to launch next Monday 20th November - just in time for Black Friday - priced €349 at select retailers or direct from Nintendo via the My Nintendo Store. 


A Nintendo Switch bundle featuring Mario Kart 8 has become something of a Black Friday staple - though previous years have featured a regular launch model Switch rather than the improved OLED upgrade.

The update, which is scheduled for later this month, will include two &#x27;Legacy Heists&#x27; from Payday 2.


The heists in question are Cook off and Turbid Station. Starbreeze says their arrival will allow players to &quot;relive the thrill and excitement&quot; of the previous game&#x27;s heists, but with a slight reimagining and improved gameplay.

                              <span>A familiar Modern Warfare 3 skin is once again playing havoc in the game&#x27;s multiplayer modes,  prompting complaints from players.

Modern Warfare 3 allows players to transfer a &quot;vast amount&quot; of their previously acquired Modern Warfare 2 content over to this year&#x27;s Call of Duty release - including the controversial Gaia operator skin, which could be acquired as part of Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s Blackcell Battle Pass bundles. This has been dubbed the Groot skin within the community given its likeness to Marvel&#x27;s sentient tree-like creature. 


The Gaia skin is described by Activision as an &quot;ancient goddess of considerable power, [that] uses her earthen form to inspire ruin in her enemies&quot;. As you can see from the header image above, it is incredibly dark and see-through in places, making it almost indistinguishable from many of the surroundings in Modern Warfare&#x27;s multiplayer maps (both 2 and 3).

                              <span>Lara Croft is coming to Magic: The Gathering as part of an upcoming Secret Lair x Tomb Raider collaboration. 


This collaboration will see six cards and a new treasure token making their way to the trading card game. Five of these cards are familiar Magic cards which have been re-imagined with artwork from the Tomb Raider games.


The cards themselves feature scenes from across the series, with the likes of Rise of the Tomb Raider&#x27;s Kitezh and the original/Anniversary game&#x27;s Lost Valley making a showing. There is also an equipment card for Totec&#x27;s Spear (from Guardian of Light), while Lara&#x27;s bow features as The Grim Whisperer.

The game will be published by Tencent, but &quot;due to uncertainties in creating a successful game to the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks&quot;, both companies have &quot;discussed a new direction&quot; for the project.


It&#x27;s got a new codename too: Kestrel.

The winner will also receive a regular black Xbox wireless controller, as the chocolate controller presumably can&#x27;t be used with the console. 
This is the first-ever &quot;official edible&quot; Xbox controller, the company notes, which begs the question - who is making unofficial edible Xbox controllers and out of what? Chocolate would be my last choice. Surely it&#x27;ll melt really quickly in your hands?

The disc drive was shown in action by YouTuber Mystic in a PS5 slim unboxing video, in which he walked through the process of pairing the drive with a console. 
The disc drive will easily pair to a console, even if it&#x27;s already registered to a different one and the console has its own disc drive registered.

A post on X, formerly Twitter, from Nintendo this afternoon stated that tomorrow&#x27;s broadcast would last 20 minutes, and feature &quot;new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch&quot;.

                              <span>A Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 player has laid down the Bear% gauntlet with a sex speedrun of under an hour.


The speedrunner, Weedmoder, currently holds the world record time of 50 minutes and 30 seconds and shared a video of the run online (thanks VG247).



Of course, the speedrun involves banging the bear, aka druid Halsin. That means completing his romance questline, which cannot be done until Act 3.

                              <span>A recently-published Sony patent application shows the company has been further researching a way to allow players to replay a game from specific points while streaming and experience its storyline again.

Titled Content Streaming With Gameplay Launch, the patent was filed on 11th July 2023 and publically published on 2nd November via WIPO (spotted by Exputer).

It describes a game which contains multiple &quot;trigger points of media content&quot;. These are moments which the player could start a replay from, which would be provided &quot;by the platform, publisher, or third-party publisher&quot;. These trigger points are described as the start of an &quot;activity&quot; such as a boss battle or quest, or when a player levels up.

Reina is the 32nd and final fighter to join the upcoming release&#x27;s roster, but, as is always the case, last is certainly not the least. Her character promises lightning fast moves, and a mysterious interest in Jin. Why does she want to fight him so badly? We will have to wait to find out.


You can watch Reina&#x27;s Tekken 8 introduction trailer below.

Quarry, Rundown and Scrapyard were removed from the game&#x27;s Hardpoint playlists last Thursday, 9th November, after players complained. In a post on its bug-tracking social media account, Activision acknowledged &quot;an issue causing unfavourable spawns&quot;. 


Karachi was next to go last Friday, 10th November - binned from Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s Cutthroat playlist while Activision, it said, worked to &quot;resolve an issue causing a player to spawn alongside enemies&quot;.

Not to be confused with Let Me Solo Her, who assisted players with the iconic Malenia battle, Let Me Solo Them wears a similar jar helm attire but their focus is the game&#x27;s pair of final bosses - hence the name.


&quot;It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I&#x27;m sincerely grateful,&quot; said the player on reddit. &quot;This marks the end of a chapter but I just wanted to say, thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the players that summoned me.&quot;

                              <span>PlayStation 5 accounted for 51 percent of all console sales in the UK over the past six months.


Sony&#x27;s latest console held a 43 percent share on all console sales between November 2022 and October 2023, according to UK chart firm GfK (via Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz).  But hone in on the last six months and the PS5&#x27;s sales account for just over 50 percent of all console purchases since May.


GfK games boss Dorian Bloch said these figures are a result of various price promotions held over the summer months, the console&#x27;s recent EA Sports FC bundle and, of course, &quot;unrestricted sales&quot; on the standard PlayStation 5 model. Unlike previous years, there are currently no supply and stock shortages for Sony&#x27;s PS5 console here in the UK.

The game will feature fully-customisable touch controls designed specifically for this version, though a Bluetooth controller will be compatible too.

                              <span>UK boxed sales for Modern Warfare 3 fell 25 percent short on last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 launch.


That&#x27;s according to UK sales figures shared by numbers company GFK (via GamesIndustry.biz). 80 percent of boxed sales were on PlayStation, with 20 percent on Xbox.


The new Modern Warfare 3 marks the first time Activision Blizzard has double dipped on the same Call of Duty sub-brand two years running to immediately release a direct sequel to the previous year&#x27;s game. But controversy has swirled around the game&#x27;s development and release.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players have discovered a strange bug that essentially traps players against an invisible wall, stopping them from moving and leaving them exposed to competitors.

The issue – which has been around for some time now – chiefly affects players on the Colosseo map, and sees players get trapped. Without the help of characters like Lifeweaver of Mei&#x27;s movement abilities to bump them out of position, they&#x27;ll stay trapped, too.

Despite many players reporting they&#x27;ve also been stuck in this exact spot as a myriad of different players, it doesn&#x27;t look like Blizzard&#x27;s yet been able to address the problem.

It&#x27;s left fans wondering how NetherRealm will implement Homelander, and who will be the voice behind the character when he joins as a guest fighter next year.

&quot;My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined,&quot; lamented one unhappy fan in a comment that has been upvoted hundreds of times.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence will change so many aspects of society, largely in ways that we cannot conceive of yet. Democracy, and the systems of governance that surround it, will be no exception. In this short essay, I want to move beyond the “AI-generated disinformation” trope and speculate on some of the ways AI will change how democracy functions—in both large and small ways.
When I survey how artificial intelligence might upend different aspects of modern society, democracy included, I look at four different dimensions of change: speed, scale, scope, and sophistication. Look for places where changes in degree result in changes of kind. Those are where the societal upheavals will happen...</span>

                              <span>Disney Pixar&#x27;s PSP title, Up, is coming to PlayStation&#x27;s Classics Catalogue.

That&#x27;s according to Gematsu, which noted that the 2009 adventure game had recently popped up in Taiwan and was rated for PS4 and PS5 by the Taiwanese ratings board.

There&#x27;s been no formal confirmation from either Sony or then-publisher THQ that the family favourite adventure game was coming to current-gen Sony systems.

                              <span>Sledgehammer Games has hit back at reports about the development cycle of Modern Warfare 3, insisting it is &quot;incredibly proud&quot; of the latest Call of Duty instalment and says that its &quot;proud to be the team to lead the way on Modern Warfare 3&quot;, and &quot;anything said to the contrary is simply not true&quot;.

The statement comes days after Bloomberg broke the news that employees needed to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period.

&quot;We’re incredibly proud of Modern Warfare 3 – both the full game experience at launch and the upcoming year of content we have planned for the community,&quot; said Sledgehammer&#x27;s studio head, Aaron Halon.

As spotted by Naruki on X/Twitter, players who&#x27;ve already pre-ordered the remake from the eShop have discovered that ArtePiazza - perhaps best known for its work on Square Enix&#x27;s Dragon Quest series - has taken the reigns, with Nintendo&#x27;s Ayako Moriwaki stepping into the director role.

That said, some of the inaugural developers who worked on the 1996 original have also been credited in the game, including co-director Yoshihiko Maekawa, composer Yoko Shimomura, and designer Taro Kudo.

                              <span>Netflix has revealed Doug Cockle - the gravelly voice of Geralt of Rivia in CD Projekt&#x27;s The Witcher series - will be reprising his role as the silver-haired monster-bopper in a new animated movie coming to the streaming service &quot;late&quot; next year.


The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, as the film is officially titled, begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. However, as answers are slowly revealed, Geralt finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.


&quot;He must count on friends — old and new,&quot; Netflix teases in its announcement, &quot;to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting Nightdive Studios&#x27; Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion remaster, you&#x27;ll need to hang in there just a bit longer; the developer is delaying its release by a few weeks, with the dino FPS now coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 30th November.


Nightdive&#x27;s remastering of the original Turok trilogy - which was developed by the now-defunct Iguana Entertainment - has been quite the undertaking; the studio released its Turok 1 remaster eight years ago, back in 2015, and its sequel got the spruce-up treatment two years later. 


Nightdive&#x27;s Turok 3 remaster - which will mark the first time the game has been available since its N64 debut in 2000 - promises to be similarly thorough, introducing enhanced environment art and character models, updated weapon models, plus &quot;advanced rendering features&quot; that&#x27;ll include anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has attempted to placate angry Mortal Kombat 1 players with two &#x27;free&#x27; Fatalities following an outcry caused by the decision to introduce a $10 USD Fatality animation to the game&#x27;s already heavily criticised premium store.


Despite being sold as a full-price title costing £59.99/$69.99 USD, the latest entry in developer NetherRealm&#x27;s long-running fighting series features a rotational in-game shop selling store-exclusive cosmetics - including costumes and gear - only available to purchase with real-world money (in contrast, Mortal Kombat 11 also enabled players to buy cosmetics, but these could largely also be earned by completing activities in-game).


While Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s premium store has already drawn plenty of ire from players, things came to a head last month when Warner Bros. and developer NetherRealm began selling a store-exclusive Halloween Fatality animation for $10. To put that in some kind of perspective, $20 would get you several DLC characters in Mortal Kombat 11.

                              <span>Whatever you might think of Call of Duty, you can&#x27;t accuse its anti-cheat team of lacking imagination; having previously caused chaos for multiplayer cheaters by whisking away their weapons and turning opponents invisible, it&#x27;ll soon be cutting their parachute cords and causing their bunny hops to launch them 10,000ft into the air before a very messy end.


This latest bit of mischief is the work of the team behind Call of Duty&#x27;s server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, officially known as Ricochet, which outlined its latest steps in the war against online ne&#x27;er-do-wells - particularly the role Machine Learning plays in improving its anti-cheat systems - in a timely blog post coinciding with today&#x27;s launch of Modern Warfare 3.


&quot;Combining everything [we have] developed over the course of the last two years with new Machine Learning advancements,&quot; it wrote, &quot;Richochet: Anti-Cheat is preparing for the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 with a stronger and faster process to combat cheating.&quot;

                              <span>Mass Effect fans have been debating a recent claim that the next game in the series may not launch until 2029.


This week, Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb suggested Mass Effect 5 would not arrive until near the end of the decade, based on insider knowledge and some back of the envelope maths based on the ongoing and protracted development of Dragon Age Dreadwolf.


Grubb&#x27;s comments were predictably pounced upon by fans following a somewhat mixed response to this year&#x27;s annual Mass Effect franchise celebrations on 7th November - N7 Day.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto has admitted Nintendo faces &quot;an extremely high hurdle&quot; not to disappoint fans across the world with the forthcoming film.


Following the company&#x27;s latest earnings report, Miyamoto and CEO Shuntaro Furukawa were asked about the risks of expanding IPs beyond video games, to which Miyamoto responded directly on the Zelda live-action film that was announced during the report.



&quot;Regarding the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, I know we face an extremely high hurdle in producing a film that will not disappoint the global fan base,&quot; he said. &quot;With this challenge in mind, I have been discussing this project with Avi Arad, Chairman of Arad Productions Inc., for about 10 years.&quot;

                              <span>Twitch is removing its controversial Hype Chat feature, based on &quot;community feedback&quot;.

Hype Chat was a feature launched in June that allowed viewers to pay to have messages pinned at the top of a streamer&#x27;s chat window.



Now, just five months later, it&#x27;s being deprecated from 15th November and instead Twitch will invest more into Cheering and Bits.

                              <span>Activision has claimed its Call of Duty HQ launcher provides easier file management and seamless switching between games, despite criticism from players.


Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, the latest in the series, now launches from Call of Duty HQ alongside last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2. Activision describes the launcher as &quot;the front door for Call of Duty&quot; and states &quot;players have control over the footprint of their Call of Duty experience on their platform of choice, and it&#x27;s all contained within one unified location&quot;.


In practice, however, it&#x27;s confusing plenty of players and has resulted in huge file sizes - as previously reported, the install size of the complete package is over 200GB on some platforms.

Larian&#x27;s own Swen Vincke recently shared a rather welcome update with his followers over on X (formerly Twitter). In a new post, the CEO shared two graphs showing how RAM and VRAM loads for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Series S port have been reduced in recent weeks. 

&quot;Got a nice present from our engineers. Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back. I think this will benefit all platforms too,&quot; he wrote to accompany the two graphs (which you can see via the embed below).

Back at BlizzCon last week, The War Within expansion was revealed along with two further expansions to begin the multi-part Worldsoul Saga. However, the Epic edition (costing $89.99) includes guaranteed beta access and three days of early access, the first time Warcraft has offered this.


Fans have responded angrily, as per this reddit thread, but Hazzikostas said the studio is following a trend.

                              <span>A new report claims Modern Warfare 3 was developed in just 16 months. That&#x27;s roughly half the time of a standard Call of Duty release. 


More than a dozen employees at developer Sledgehammer shared their experiences working on the Modern Warfare 2 sequel with Bloomberg - in particular the need to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period. 


Meanwhile, sources said that Modern Warfare 3 initially started out as an expansion to last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 - something that was previously suggested. This expansion, which was codenamed Jupiter, was reportedly going to be set solely in Mexico, rather than a globe spanning release the Call of Duty series is typically known for.

                              <span>Unity is &quot;likely&quot; to announce layoffs as part of broader cost cutting measures.


As noted in the company&#x27;s Q3 earnings report, Unity is assessing its product portfolio &quot;to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers&quot; and is &quot;evaluating the right cost structure that aligns with the more focused portfolio&quot;.


Changes will be completed before the end of Q1 in 2024, which will &quot;likely include discontinuing certain product offerings, reducing our workforce, and reducing our office footprint&quot; (thanks The Verge).

                              <span>It&#x27;s been just over two years since acclaimed animated League of Legends spin-off Arcane launched on Netflix, but finally its long-awaited second season has the closest thing to a release date yet. The bad news is there&#x27;s still a long wait in store; the streaming service has now confirmed Arcane season two will launch in November 2024.


The first season of Arcane told the story of sisters Jinx and Vi - two of League of Legends most popular champions - as they find themselves caught on different sides of a conflict between the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun, which hits boiling point after the invention of Hextech technology.


Hailee Steinfeld and Ella Purnell will reprise their roles as Vi and Jinx in Arcane&#x27;s upcoming second season - which fans have been waiting for since it was confirmed to be happening shortly after the release of season one - with Katie Leung also set to return as Caitlyn Kiramman.

                              <span>Warframe developer Digital Extremes has confirmed a &quot;number of&quot; layoffs at the studio resulting from the closure of its publishing division. It&#x27;s also announced it&#x27;ll no longer be publishing free-to-play online action-RPG Wayfinder following the closure, and that full control of the property will return to developer Airship Syndicate.


In a statement provided to Eurogamer after news of layoffs at the studio was broken via PC Gamer, Digital Extremes wrote, &quot;We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division.&quot;


&quot;We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result,&quot; the statement continued, &quot;and we&#x27;re working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in the coming months.&quot;

                              <span>Remnant 2&#x27;s first expansion, The Awakened King, is right around the corner, and ahead of its release next Tuesday, 14th November, developer Gunfire Games has revealed a second copy of the DLC won&#x27;t be required to play it with a friend.


The Awakened King, to provide a bit of context, introduces a new storyline focusing on the Root-corrupted (and decidedly peeved) One True King. It&#x27;ll see players attempting to uncover his secrets by exploring the seaside town of the Forlorn Coast, a new area of Losomn containing dungeons and &quot;unexpected allies&quot;. It also adds news weapons and equipment, new enemies and bosses, plus the new Ritualist archetype.


It sounds like a good solid chunk of stuff for Remnant 2 fans to get stuck into, then, and Gunfire Games has now confirmed over on social media that players won&#x27;t need to own a copy of The Awakened King themselves in order to play through its storyline and visit its new location with a friend that&#x27;s already made a purchase.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been over three years since developer Jonathan Blow announced his critically acclaimed, time-manipulating platform-puzzler Braid was getting an Anniversary Edition, but, finally, a release is in sight; it&#x27;s coming to Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Netflix mobile on April 30th, 2024.


Given that Braid initially launched for Xbox 360 all the way back in August 2008, its Anniversary Edition will be arriving squarely within its 15th birthday year, and a significant amount of work has been done on the original release to celebrate that milestone.


For starters, Braid&#x27;s gorgeous visuals have been &quot;hand-repainted&quot; by original artist David Hellman. Today&#x27;s press release doesn&#x27;t elaborate on that much, but when the Anniversary Edition was announced in 2020, Blow said his Thekla Inc. studio was working on enhanced foregrounds and backgrounds, increased level of detail in certain areas, plus extra animations and effects to improve the feel of movement.

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Deck OLED, a revamped version of its popular handheld PC which boasts - as you might guess - a shiny new OLED screen as its star feature.


Steam Deck OLED retains the existing size and main technical specs of the current Steam Deck (so all current Steam Deck verified games will run the same on OLED models), but includes an improved display that&#x27;s bigger and uses HDR.


The new OLED models go on sale next week, on 16th November at 6pm UK time priced at $549 for a 512GB model or $649 for a 1TB model. (There&#x27;s also a lower $399 price right now for the 256GB current LCD model, which is sticking around as an entry-price alternative.)

Speaking to Eurogamer ahead of today&#x27;s Steam Deck OLED announcement, Valve engineers discussed the features it is adding to its shinier new handheld model that were not possible to provide back when the original Steam Deck debuted. 


The company also said it was working on game projects - plural - right now which were still targeting current Steam Deck hardware performance levels (which remain unchanged in the OLED).

                              <span>As we stroll gamely into month two of Sea of Thieves&#x27; extremely long-delayed Season 10, Rare has announced that the second of its three big tentpole features - the new PvP-focused Skull of the Siren Song voyage - will arrive next Thursday, 16th November.


The Skull of the Siren Song provides a more action-orientated addition to Rare&#x27;s piratical multiplayer adventure following the introduction of Guilds last month, essentially unfolding as an opt-in server-wide race to find the titular jewel-encrusted treasure.


Crews can opt-in to the new voyage whenever a ghostly note randomly appears on their ship&#x27;s mast during play. Once a sufficient number of teams are signed up, Captain Briggsy appears to hand them all two maps maps - one pointing to a chest containing the fabled skull, the other to the key required to open it - whereupon a messy dash to retrieve them both is likely to ensue.

That&#x27;s according to a Korean forum for the forthcoming game, which claims producer Yoshinori Kitase mentioned in an interview a certain segment of the Rebirth trailer was actually taken from this CG sequence, which will be available to view at any time.


Final Fantasy streamer Aitai Kimochi shared the news on X, formerly Twitter, but noted the Korean forum doesn&#x27;t list an exact source for the interview.

                              <span>Strauss Zelnick, boss of GTA publisher Take-Two, has credited the company&#x27;s &quot;three-part strategy&quot; as the reason it has managed to avoid mass layoffs this year.


As we have reported numerous times over the past several months, the video game industry has seen layoffs after layoffs this year. This has resulted in studios being closed, such as Saints Row developer Volition. Others, such as Epic, have seen their numbers significantly reduced. 


According to Zelnick, Take-Two has managed to avoid such consequences thanks to moderate investments and a focus on efficiency over recent years.

Speaking at the Paley International Council Summit on 7th November, Zelnick highlighted AI&#x27;s potential in game development, specifically for NPCs (as reported by Inverse).
Interactions between players and NPCs are normally scripted, which Zelnick described as &quot;generally not very interesting&quot;. Using AI to generate dialogue trees and add variety could make the interactions &quot;really interesting and fun&quot;, he stated.

                              <span>The new Pokémon animated series is set to launch in the UK on the BBC in December.


Pokémon Horizons: The Series marks the biggest shakeup for the franchise in over 25 years, after main protagonist Ash Ketchum ended his journey earlier this year.


It will be available on BBC iPlayer and CBBC, though there&#x27;s no specific release date just yet.

                              <span>Broken Roads, the upcoming narrative-driven cRPG from developer Drop Bear Bytes, has been delayed.


The game was set to release in just a few days time, on 14th November. However, the developer has now announced it has delayed the game at the last minute to &quot;allow for additional polish time&quot;. More work is needed to make sure Broken Roads isn&#x27;t broken on release, essentially, with the help of more QA testing.


In a post on Steam, the Broken Roads team stated the game was &quot;content complete&quot; but &quot;coming in longer&quot; than originally expected. The developer said its roughly 30 hours of gameplay and vast dialogue had made it &quot;extremely time-consuming to properly test&quot; all of the game&#x27;s content.

That&#x27;s according to its latest financial earnings report, where hardware sales for the last quarter were 4.9m - a Q2 record for a PlayStation console. As previously reported in August, Sony had then sold 41.7m units.


Sony stated these sales were in-line with expectations and a 25 percent increase on PS4 units sold in the equivalent period (Q2 FY17). Further, the 4.9m PS5 consoles sold in Q2 is a 48 percent increase compared to last year, likely owing to increased stock.

In a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, Toufexis said both he and Jones &quot;worked for months&quot; providing dialogue for the main player character. 


But, as we all know to be the case, Bethesda ultimately decided Starfield&#x27;s protagonist should remain silent.

But in the years since, Star Wars: Hunters has been repeatedly delayed, with an original 2021 launch window turning into 2022, then 2023, and now - as of last night - 2024.


In a statement issued to X, formerly Twitter, last night, Zynga said it had made the &quot;difficult decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters to 2024&quot;, without providing any more concrete launch details.

                              <span>Sony has halved the number of live service games it plans to release by March 2026 from 12 to six.


Back in February 2022, Sony stated it aimed to launch over 10 new live service games. The news came days after it acquired Destiny developer Bungie



Now, however, it seems plans are being scaled back to ensure each live service game&#x27;s quality, as Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki explained on a call discussing the company&#x27;s latest financial results (thanks VGC).

                              <span>Unannounced football game Lego 2K Goooal! has leaked yet again, this time with official artwork via a listing on the PlayStation Store. 


It&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve got an impression of how the game will look, with fantasy Lego characters such as a knight and a pirate with a peg-leg, and what looks like a dragon flying through the sky.


The artwork was spotted on the PlayStation Store and shared on social media by industry analyst MauroNL, who noted that the product&#x27;s page had since been deleted.

Dimensions can be hidden deep in the product description, or not included at all...</span>
