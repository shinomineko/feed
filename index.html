                              <span>Ikea has issued a cease and desist demand to an indie horror developer insisting they change their unreleased horror game in a bid to stop press and players alike from comparing it to its global furniture chain.

The Store is Closed - which we told you about a couple of weeks ago - is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games&#x27; The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy. 

Whilst it doesn&#x27;t use any of Ikea&#x27;s products, names, or branding, Ikea believes the developer is infringing on its copyright and has sent in New York legal firm Fross Zelnick. Consequently, Ziggy - who&#x27;s based in the UK - has ten days to make the changes or face legal action.

                              <span>It looks like the long-rumoured Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake may be announced at the upcoming The Game Awards.

The news comes via a now-deleted video that reportedly popped up on Chinese studio Virtuos&#x27; YouTube channel earlier today.

You can never delete something quicker than someone can save a copy of it, though; Virtuos&#x27; video - regardless of whether it had been published intentionally or otherwise - is now doing the rounds, and has Metal Gear fans speculating that the remake may soon be formally confirmed.

That&#x27;s according to u/FelineXJunkie, who posted on the game&#x27;s subreddit community reporting that they&#x27;d received an email from Blizzard, inviting them to feedback on their experiences with the game so far, touching &quot;heavily&quot; on the shooter&#x27;s in-game store and battle pass.

&quot;I got an email from Blizzard requesting that I fill out a survey. It heavily touched on topics regarding the Battle Pass and the Overwatch Store,&quot; they wrote. &quot;If you haven&#x27;t already, be sure to fill it out. I really hope this is a first step towards change.&quot;

&quot;We are disabling attachment tuning until further notice to investigate crashes for users with 5 attachments tuned,&quot; Infinite Ward announced on social media.

Sony&#x27;s exclusive is out on 9th November, but it seems players have got their hands on it early and are sharing screenshots online, as well as spoilers about the game&#x27;s key story beats.

&quot;You know, right now, I can really understand the benefit of having just an installer on the physical disc. smh&quot;, Barlog tweeted overnight.

Season 3 has yet to air on the streaming service, but already we have confirmation that for Season 4, Cavill is set to be replaced as titular monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia by Liam Hemsworth, most famous for playing Gale Hawthorne in The Hunger Games movie series.


Cavill, who recently announced his return to the role of Superman for DC, issued a statement praising his replacement:

                              <span>Another day, another Steam concurrent user record broken. This time, it comes just days after Steam hit 30m concurrent players and sees Valve&#x27;s PC gaming client clock up a giant 30,049,264 simultaneous players.

That said, whilst that figure comes from SteamDB, Steam itself states the all-time peak is a more modest 30,044,046. In either case, though, it&#x27;s proof that PC gaming remains on the rise, even if the majority of those players were idling at the time (SteamDB estimates &quot;just&quot; 8.9 million were actively in-game at the time the record was set).

Steam numbers have been rising since the pandemic began in 2020, with a previous previous peak of just under 30 million set back in March this year.

                              <span>Luminous Productions has kicked off an all-new behind-the-scenes series for its upcoming action-PRG, Forspoken.

The first of a three-part series, &quot;Magic Parkour&quot; focuses on protagonist Frey Holland and - predictably enough - her &quot;magic-enhanced parkour&quot; and traversal skills. We also get to see &quot;the variety of spells at her disposal giving players a taste of what to expect when the game launches&quot;. You can check it out below:

The next video - slated to drop on 3rd November - will focus more on Forspoken&#x27;s combat &quot;and dive into the fundamentals of Frey&#x27;s magical combat skills&quot; by sharing more about the types of magic, attacks, and upgrades we&#x27;ll be able to unlock. The final video, out 10th November, showcases the quests, challenges and activities players will &quot;find and accomplish&quot; in the world of Athia.

In the statement, Square Enix said it was &quot;critical for [its] business that [it] produce hit titles that speak to the global market&quot;.

&quot;For our Group to better focus on developing titles for the global market in this changing environment, we need to concentrate our limited resources on the development of strong and robust titles,&quot; the company said.

A few hours later, Infinity updated the message and whilst it stopped short of giving a specific deadline as to when the issue will be resolved, it did confirm that a fix would be coming sometime on Saturday 29th October (afternoon/evening for Europeans, morning for Americans in the Pacific Daytime Time zone).

                              <span>Sega&#x27;s biggest franchise, Sonic the Hedgehog, has topped 1.5 billion sales.

As spotted by our sister site, GamesIndustry.biz, the Japanese megacorp confirmed in its most recent financial report that that figure includes all premium sales and free-to-play downloads since the franchise was born in 1991.

Interestingly, Sega Sammy Holdings also revealed sales of its other key franchises, too. In 22 years, Total War has amassed an impressive 40.4 million units sold, Football Manager and Chain Chronicles have each sold 25 million copies, whilst the fan-favourite Persona series has sold 15.5 million units since 1996, with Persona 5 alone selling 7.22 million copies globally.

                              <span>Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog is working with a number of other PlayStation Studios teams to develop a mysterious new project in a &quot;beloved franchise&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to a newly spotted Sony job listing (thanks VGC) seeking a game design intern to work at a &quot;new PlayStation studio based in San Diego... co-developing an exciting new project with Naughty Dog in a beloved franchise.&quot; There&#x27;s no additional information about the new studio, but it seems highly likely it&#x27;s the same San-Diego-based &quot;new internal game develop team&quot; Sony referenced in a different job listing earlier this week.


That earlier job advert initially revealed the new team was being built to collaborate on a new &quot;high visibility&quot; project with Naughty Dog and Visual Arts - Sony&#x27;s San-Diego-based support studio that most recently worked with Naughty Dog on its The Last of Us: Part 1 remake. However, a later edit removed the explicit reference to Visual Arts, for reasons unknown.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s ambitious The Duviri Paradox expansion has been delayed into 2023 - but there&#x27;re still a couple of treats heading to the free-to-play sci-fi shooter before the end of the year, including a mini prequel going by the name of Lua&#x27;s Prey.


The Duviri Paradox is Warframe&#x27;s latest open-world expansion - following the likes of Plains of Eidolon and Heart of Deimos - and plunges players into the extremely weird world of Duviri, a fantasy-western-themed kingdom existing inside the mind of new big bad Dominus Thrax. More striking, though - and there&#x27;s a lot of eye-catching stuff, from its stark black and white aesthetic to its skeletal horse steed - is its new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees developer Digital Extremes &quot;flirting with rogue-like elements&quot;.


It&#x27;s intriguing stuff then, but while The Duviri Paradox was initially due to launch some time in &quot;winter 2022&quot;, Digital Extremes has now confirmed it&#x27;s pushing the expansion&#x27;s release back into 2023. The studio didn&#x27;t offer much on the reason behind the delay, only saying it was &quot;to deliver the best experience possible.&quot;

                              <span>Firaxis&#x27; Marvel-themed strategy game Midnight Suns will be adding the likes of Venom, Morbius, and Storm as paid DLC starting in early 2023.


Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s to deliver a superhero strategy game blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building. At launch on 2nd December, it&#x27;ll include 12 playable heroes, ranging from the immediately familiar - think the Avengers and X-Men - to perhaps lesser-known characters from the likes of the Runaways.


However, publisher 2K has now confirmed Midnight Suns&#x27; roster will begin to expand in early 2023, when Deadpool joins the line-up as premium DLC. Deadpool arrives in the first of four planned DLC packs - all included in a season pass or available to purchase individually - with each one adding a new hero (plus their respective abilities), new story missions, upgrades for the Abbey, plus new skins and outfits.

Mentions of connecting to PlayStation Network accounts were spotted in the mobile app for Discord last week, which suggested the integration would be happening soon.

However, sources speaking to Insider Gaming stated they expect the integration to be included as part of the PS5&#x27;s 7.00 system update, which is currently scheduled for 8th March.

The map, initially called Marina Bay Grand Prix, was announced back in August during the Call of Duty (eSports) League Championship Weekend and was seemingly inspired by the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore.


But in September, any mention of the map was purged from all of Call of Duty and Infinity Ward&#x27;s social media accounts, as well as any trailers on its YouTube channel. The map was also missing during the multiplayer open beta.

The game originally arrived on Switch in digital form only accompanying Bayonetta 2, but a physical edition was promised this year exclusive to the Nintendo Store.


This was then delayed from September to the &quot;first half of October&quot;, but fans criticised the inability to pre-order in advance.

Made by ThrillDaWill (via PCGamesN), this project, known as L3go Fallout, is truly a sight to behold. It comes with its own character creator and, of course, a wasteland to explore. 


In ThrillDaWill&#x27;s words: &quot;This fan-made project combines two of the best things! Stepping on legos with your bare feet, and endless bugs and glitches!!&quot;

Earlier this week, the company shared its latest financial results, including a hardware revenue growth of 13 percent and PC Game Pass subscriptions increasing by 159 percent year on year.



However, that still wasn&#x27;t enough to meet Microsoft&#x27;s targets, according to a new financial filing (reported by Axios).

                              <span>Earlier this week, Warner Bros. Montréal released a PC patch for Gotham Knights. 


However, in doing so, it reportedly also removed Denuvo - the game&#x27;s anti-piracy software - by accident. 


While the developer has allegedly now reinstated this software, this slip-up left Gotham Knights free for hackers to, well, hack for a period of time (via Reddit).

The reason for the tussle? Pokémon Go.

Codes for these in-game extras are now being sold on eBay, with most sold listings ranging from around £20 to £40 and (amusingly) not always including postage. Some are even higher.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) had a timed exclusive survival mode in Spec Ops, while Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War had an exclusive Zombies mode called Onslaught.

Console players tend to disable crossplay to avoid matching against PC players using keyboard and mouse or may be hacking. On the flip side, PC players may wish to avoid console players who have aim assist.

It’s likely to be abused to disclose server memory contents, and potentially reveal user details, and could be easily exploited remotely to compromise server private keys or execute code execute remotely. In other words, pretty much everything you don’t want happening on your production systems...</span>

                              <span>Frontier has announced it is ending post-launch support for its inaugural F1 Manager sim less than two months after release, saying its next patch will be the game&#x27;s last major update as it moves staff elsewhere to &quot;ensure upcoming F1 Manager projects realise their potential&quot;.


F1 Manager 2022, which launched at the end of August, is the first of four games planned for release under Frontier&#x27;s new F1 licensing deal. It put players in the role of a team principal, challenging them to lead their &quot;drivers, engineers and fans to glory in the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Drivers&#x27; World Championship and FIA Formula 1 Constructors&#x27; World Championship&quot;.


While F1 Manager 2022 received a decent critical reception at launch, it&#x27;s drawn criticism among players for shallow, undercooked features and a significant number of bugs. Many had hoped at least some of these issues would be properly addressed through robust post-launch support, but Frontier has now called time on further development.

                              <span>10 years after its introduction, Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode has received a long overdue overhaul, with Valve finally making good on last year&#x27;s promise to replace the ageing UI with its decidedly more modern Steam Deck interface - albeit initially only for testing prior to a general release.


Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode first surfaced back in 2012, introducing an optional new UI for Valve&#x27;s storefront specifically designed for use with televisions and controllers. It&#x27;s changed in barely noticeable increments since then, lagging far behind Valve&#x27;s recent major overhaul for Steam&#x27;s desktop mode, but as of today, it&#x27;s out with the old and in with the new. 


Just as it promised last July, Valve has now replaced the old Big Picture mode with the far more modern UI created for its handheld gaming PC, Steam Deck. &quot;This controller-first interface was designed for Steam Deck in handheld and docked mode,&quot; Valve explains, &quot;and is perfect for all the scenarios Big Picture mode currently handles.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s all looking a bit Sonic the Hedgehog as the year nears its end; not only does the blue streak make his video game return next month in Sonic Frontiers, Netflix has confirmed its 3D animated series Sonic Prime is hitting the streaming service on Thursday, 15th December.


Sonic Prime was announced last February, after a bit of a premature reveal toward the end of 2020, with Netflix promising a 24-episode series that would send Sonic on a &quot;journey of self-discovery and redemption&quot; in which the &quot;fate of a strange new multiverse&quot; was in his hands.


Since then, we&#x27;ve had teases, plus a slightly more revealing 40-second trailer, confirming appearance from Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Big the Cat - who appears to be having something of a renaissance this year, seeing as he&#x27;s also been sighted in Sonic Frontiers.

                              <span>Five years after developer Jumpship formally unveiled its side-scrolling sci-fi apocalypse adventure Somerville, a release is in sight, with the studio having somewhat unexpectedly announced a 15th November launch on Xbox One and PC earlier today.


Jumpship is an independent studio founded by film animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Dino Patti, co-founder and former CEO of Limbo studio Playdead. And while Somerville&#x27;s formal reveal came in 2017, Olsen - who has worked the likes of Skyfall and The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron - had already been tinkering away on the project for three years before that.


Somerville - described as a &quot;hand-crafted narrative experience set across a vivid rural landscape&quot; that sees players navigating perilous terrain &quot;to unravel the mysteries of Earth&#x27;s visitors&quot; - has continued to look wonderfully intriguing since its big reveal. However, it&#x27;s been nearly a year since its most recent public showing.

                              <span>EA has confirmed it won&#x27;t be stopping distribution of physical products across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.


Reports have emerged that EA would no longer distribute physical games in German-speaking countries, according to its latest annual report.


However, it seems this was misinterpreted as EA confirms this is incorrect.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s full release is just around the corner, and ahead of this developer Infinity Ward is keen to clear some things up - notably that, despite some similarities in missions, the game is not running a &quot;commentary&quot; on the world&#x27;s current events.


&quot;It&#x27;s an entertainment adventure,&quot; Call of Duty narrative director Brian Bloom explained recently (via PCGamesN). &quot;And as far as real people and real places doing real things, you know, these are not based on actual events.&quot;


Bloom went on to state the team is, however, inspired by real-world events. &quot;We want you to feel like when you play the game, it&#x27;s happening in the world that you live in, and our heroes are here to do things that put the world back the way it was, in the way we left it, to restore it,&quot; he continued.

In a crossover that nobody asked for, the screenshots (spotted on Resetera) show Brazilian forward Neymar and French midfielder Pogba wearing military attire and posing like they&#x27;ve just hit a 24 killstreak. 


Rumours of footballers featuring in Modern Warfare 2 first emerged earlier this month when dataminer The Ghost Of Hope released a list of unreleased Operators that will make their way to the game.

                              <span>With Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season, Eclipse, mere days away now, developer Respawn is finally ready to discuss Catalyst, the free-to-play battle royale game&#x27;s newest hero, in more detail, breaking down the abilities she&#x27;ll bring to the latest round of the Apex Games.


Speaking at a recent press briefing, Respawn explained the starting point for Catalyst&#x27;s aesthetic was &quot;techno witch&quot;, with her final design aiming to represent both stylishness - in her emo goth vibes - and technological practicality. She is, after all, a member of a terraforming crew hired to help restore the moon of Cleo - which, as Season 15 begins, has been turned in an Apex Games arena, something Catalyst won&#x27;t stand for.


Described as an &quot;elegant and standoffish woman who likes crystals more than she likes people&quot;, Catalyst is Apex Legends&#x27; first trans character - voiced by trans actor Meli Grant - and, as Respawn succinctly puts it, simply reflects the fact the &quot;real world is a diverse place&quot;.

Now, we have more details on what this elusive game actually is - and what it is, is an online co-op combat game that is set in a fantasy version of London.


Speaking via the SIE Blog, co-studio heads Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders shared more details about this currently unnamed game, which they call the team&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious project to date&quot;.

The &quot;New Zealand&quot; trick, which lets players trick their consoles into letting them access a game that doesn&#x27;t release until midnight in their own region, has been a staple of game releases for many years. 


But Infinity Ward has issued a statement warning players may experience &quot;connectivity issues&quot; and &quot;may be locked out of the game&quot; until the game is officially released in their region.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Montréal has released a PC patch for Gotham Knights addressing some of the game&#x27;s current issues, with the next console update coming towards the end of the week. 


Since its launch, Gotham Knights has faced a series of issues, with frame-rate drops, stutters, and frame-rate time fluctuations being reported across the board. 


&quot;We are aware that players on both PC and console have been experiencing performance challenges,&quot; the developer admitted earlier today, with an accompanying thread offering an overview of the game&#x27;s upcoming fixes.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has shared a list of changes to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer ahead of tomorrow&#x27;s release. The changes were made in response to feedback from the beta.


The biggest change is the addition of diamond icons above enemy heads to increase visibility. 


In the beta, there was no indicator to differentiate between friendly and enemy players. This was traditionally achieved through name tags in previous games, but Infinity Ward took the design decision to remove them, seemingly to add to realism. Players didn&#x27;t take kindly to the change and called for the return of name tags. Diamond icons are therefore a compromise between good enemy visibility and realism.

That&#x27;s not only because he&#x27;s too busy writing his next book, but because he gets easily addicted to games.


&quot;I have not played it, because people seem to want this Winds of Winter book,&quot; said Martin on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (spotted by GamesRadar).

This is due to the game&#x27;s violent content, which means it was unable to secure an age rating with the CERO (Japan&#x27;s equivalent of PEGI in Europe and the ESRB in North America). 


The developer has stated those who pre-ordered this version of the game will receive a full refund for their purchase.

                              <span>BioWare has revealed Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - the latest instalment in its fantasy role-playing series - has now reached the alpha stage of development and is playable &quot;to the very end&quot;.


That news was shared in a new developer blog post celebrating the alpha milestone. &quot;Up to this point, we&#x27;ve been working hard on the various parts of the game, but it&#x27;s not until the alpha milestone that a game all comes together,&quot; the developer explained.


&quot;Now, for the first time, we can experience the entire game, from the opening scenes of the first mission to the very end,&quot; it continued. &quot;We can see, hear, feel, and play everything as a cohesive experience.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s head of gaming Phil Spencer has discussed possible price increases across the Xbox line, acknowledging that while the company has so far maintained prices for its consoles, Game Pass, and games, it will &quot;at some point...have to raise the price on certain things&quot;.


Speaking at the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s Tech Live (thanks The Verge), Spencer admitted, &quot;We&#x27;ve held price on our console, we&#x27;ve held price on games and our subscription. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be able to do that forever... I do think at some point we&#x27;ll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.&quot;


Earlier this year, of course, Sony announced it would be increasing the cost of PlayStation 5 in response to &quot;high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends&quot;. At the time, Spencer said Xbox would not be following suit, explaining, &quot;When our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right move.&quot; Given Spencer&#x27;s latest comments, though, it&#x27;s unclear how long that might last.

In a statement announcing their departure on the Rocksteady website, Warner Bros. Games&#x27; David Haddad praised the duo&#x27;s work, complimenting their commitment to &quot;the highest quality and excellence across all facets of game development&quot;.


He continued: &quot;With Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League nearly finished, they have both decided to leave Rocksteady at the end of 2022 and will begin a new adventure in gaming. We have the utmost respect and gratitude for Jamie and Sefton and wish them all the best in their new endeavour, and like many fans, we look forward to what they do next.&quot;

Over the weekend, huge batches of information were shared online that revealed details of new characters, quests, and events from version 3.3 until 3.8.


HoYoverse has DMCA striked posts containing information from the data breach, although any future updates are of course subject to change.

Rather, it will be coming after the fact, much like it did with 2018&#x27;s God of War.


Sony Santa Monica confirmed this news in  a tweet, stating it will share more details on Ragnarök&#x27;s photo mode further down the line.

Called Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Convergence, it gives a little insight into the events leading up to the start of the game as Sonic and friends travel to the Starfall Islands in search of the chaos emeralds.


Part one of the comic was released on Twitter last week; now the second part has been published.

                              <span>Apple has confirmed the iPhone will be getting that USB-C cable port, in accordance with the European Commission&#x27;s upcoming mandate.


By autumn 2024, all portable electronic devices sold in the EU will need to use USB Type-C for charging. The aim is to reduce electronic waste and be more consumer friendly by having just one &quot;common charger&quot;.


Now the powers that be at Apple have confirmed the company will release an iPhone with this charging port - even though it is not very happy about it all.

The new pricing tool suggests prices across the 39 currencies supported by Steam to simplify the process for developers, though these are just recommendations.


&quot;We think it&#x27;s a helpful guide, but with purchasing power and foreign exchange rates constantly evolving, we needed to make significant changes to those conversion recommendations to stay current,&quot; said Valve in its announcement.

At the time of writing, the game&#x27;s highest concurrent player peak (via SteamDB) is 10,851.

                              <span>In a flurry of Age of Empires news announced during the series&#x27; 25th anniversary livestream today, Microsoft revealed Age of Empires 2 and 4 are heading to Xbox consoles next year, and that an Age of Mythology Definitive Edition is in the works for PC.


Whispers of an Xbox appearance for Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition first emerged earlier today, after a new console listing was spotted on the PEGI ratings database. However, it didn&#x27;t take long for Microsoft to make it official, confirming that both it and Age of Empires 4 are heading to Xbox and xCloud in 2023.


More specifically, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition comes to Xbox on 31st January, while Age of Empires 4 is expected to arrive &quot;later in the year&quot;.

                              <span>As Bethesda&#x27;s month of Fallout 25th anniversary celebrations continues, Amazon has joined in the fun by sharing the first official image from its upcoming live-action Fallout television series.


Prime Video and Kilter Films - the production company behind the TV adaptation, headed by Westworld creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - revealed the image as part of a special birthday tweet, accompanied by the message, &quot;We made something special for the occasion&quot;.


It shows a mysterious figure silhouetted in the open entrance to Vault 33, while three other figures - all wearing their regulation blue Vault-Tec jumpsuits - look on from within. Rather ominously, a pair of legs can be seen on the floor in the distance.

                              <span>Redfall, the vampire-hunting co-op shooter from Arkane Austin, is getting into the spirit of the spooky season with a new trailer showcasing the titular town&#x27;s vampiric denizens.


It&#x27;s all a lot more atmospheric than previous showings for the game - which have predominantly focused on the camaraderie and quippery of its four playable heroes - and ramps up the spookiness by highlighting the varied vampire opponents waiting to be encountered in Redfall, Massachusetts. One sequence, in which a player prowls a blood-spattered family home by torchlight, suggests Redfall may even have time for a few proper scares among its mayhem.


&quot;From the devious Angler to the ever-vigilant Watcher,&quot; teases the blurb accompanying the trailer, &quot;this is just a bite of what you and your squad will face as you fight to take back Redfall.&quot;

The free-to-play multiplayer game includes custom game modes that can be freely named, but some words seemingly aren&#x27;t prevented by Blizzard&#x27;s word filters.


Twitter user Lynn MBE posted a warning on Twitter when her 12-year-old son discovered a highly inappropriate custom game.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a new update for Splatoon 3 that brings communication improvements.


Since launch, players have complained of poor communication when playing online, causing inconsistent gameplay, errors, and game crashes.


Now data transfer has been improved between players so that, according to the patch notes, data will on average be transferred &quot;about .05 seconds more quickly than before&quot;.

                              <span>FromSoftware has finally reactivated online features for Dark Souls 2 on PC, but it&#x27;s not all good news.


Servers were shut down across all Dark Souls games on PC back in January due to a security issue. Dark Souls 3 servers were back in August, then offline, then back online again last month.


Now Dark Souls 2 is back, at least for the Scholar of the First Sin release that featured enhanced graphics and DLC.

As detailed in newly updated five-year release roadmap for investors, CI&#x27;s new live-service game, codenamed Project Scorpio, is being developed by its internal Underdog Studio - which makes the Sniper: Ghost Warrior games - with an anticipated launch of 2024/5. CI says the title will be supported through in-game purchase mechanics, events, and esports post-launch.


In addition to Project Scorpio, Underdog is collaborating with a currently unnamed partner studio to develop the next entry in the Sniper: Ghost Warrior series. Details on this are limited but it&#x27;s also aiming for a 2024/5 release.

                              <span>With things starting to get a little spooky as Halloween approaches, Origame Digital - the developer behind acclaimed photography adventure Umurangi Generation - has teased a brand-new horror game it&#x27;s calling FiveSeven.


FiveSeven made a sudden and unexpected appearance (as spotted in this Reddit thread) during a video on obscure horror games by Umuragi Generation composer ThorHighHeels, with the teaser dropped right into the middle of a section on Vampire Rain: Altered Species.


Beginning with a title reading The Last Train out of Narita, the 40 seconds or so of footage - which sports a similar lo-fi aesthetic to Umurangi Generation - focuses on a besuited protagonist, seemingly named Reegan. First we see them exploring a train, initially scurrying beneath its seats, before grabbing a revolver and facing off against a sinister shadow monster.

                              <span>As the march toward Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season on 1st November continues, developer Respawn Entertainment has shared a first proper look at the free-to-play battle royale game&#x27;s new semi-terraformed Broken Moon map.


Broken Moon takes players to Cleo, the fractured moon that played a major role in new hero Catalyst&#x27;s introductory Stories from the Outlands trailer. Years after a meteor impact almost destroyed it, Cleo is now partly terraformed and habitable - but to further fund its colonisation, the government has entered into a contract to hold the Apex Games there.


When players step onto the surface of Broken Moon - said to be of a similar size to Apex Legend&#x27;s World&#x27;s Edge map - they&#x27;ll discover a world of two distinct halves, one part colonised and lush with vegetation, the other still barren.

                              <span>At a launch event in the Stade de France on Thursday, Philips announced a brand new gaming brand, Evnia, with a full lineup of monitors, keyboards, mice and headsets. The name comes from the Greek Εύ and νοια and reportedly translates as &#x27;smart thinking&#x27;, and plays into an overall wholesome and inclusive vibe with a focus on &#x27;reinventing the rules&#x27; of PC peripherals. Ironically, this kind of credo is fairly endemic amongst gaming brands, but Philips has at least made some plays to differentiate themselves, designing products with refreshing off-white/grey colourways, partially built with recycled materials and fronted by Kenyan fighting games pro QueenArrow. 
As well as offering a bit of a different look to your standard black-and-red gaming gear, the keyboards, mice and headsets announced also held up well in the brief testing session we were afforded, particularly the keyboards that offered some interesting features on top of solid fundamentals. These units were still pre-production models, but there&#x27;s enough of interest here to mention ahead of their planned release date early next year.  
First up, the SPK8708 full-size mechanical keyboard. Like other high-tier Evnia peripherals, the SPK8708 is a fully wireless model that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, with the former offering lower latency and the latter broader compatibility and longer battery life. Like Philips TVs, it comes with Ambilight branded lighting that spills out behind and around the keyboard, complementing the LEDs behind each keycap. A volume wheel in the upper right corner seemed to have an integrated display inside, which could offer some interesting options along the same lines as the DF-favourite SteelSeries Apex Pro - although it didn&#x27;t seem to be operational in the unit we had access to.

Previously a specific date was given when a game would be leaving the service.



Now, while games are still listed in the Last Chance to Play tab, there is no longer a specific date.

But Silent Hill artist Masahiro Ito has now officially debunked that theory, confirming James is looking at himself.

Earlier this month, a number of key members of the development team confirmed they were no longer working at the studio. &quot;The reason for dissolving the cultural organisation is that it no longer represents the ethos it was founded on,&quot; wrote founding member of the ZA/UM cultural association Martin Luiga. &quot;People and ideas are meant to be eternal; organisations may well be temporary.&quot;


Luiga later alleged that some team members were fired on false premises.

                              <span>EA has promised The Sims fans it &quot;will do better&quot; after its recent Behind The Sims Summit only featured a single &quot;black simmer&quot;.

As part of its first ever Behind the Sims Summit Stream event , EA gave a &quot;super early&quot; look at its next Sims game, codenamed Project Rene, and shared a few future plans for The Sims 4.

However, as first noted by content creator and streamer Ebonix  and amplified by other unhappy players, the presentation - in EA&#x27;s own words - &quot;did not fairly represent our vast community of players&quot;, forcing EA to acknowledge it had &quot;let [players] down&quot;.

                              <span>Silent Hill fans have begun to decode some of the secrets hidden in the new teaser for Silent Hill: Townfall.

Announced during Konami&#x27;s Silent Hill Transmission broadcast, the brief teaser given by No Code creative director Jon McKellan invited fans to analyse the video for clues... so they did.

Whilst there&#x27;s no doubt much more to uncover, fans have discovered that there&#x27;s a SOS signal tucked between the THY FLESH IS WEAK images, whilst a riveting thread on the game&#x27;s subreddit community has discovered text in the spectrogram when converting the trailer to an mp3.

In an interview with Comic Book about his upcoming graphic novel, Isaac was asked for an update about the movie, and kindly obliged, albeit without offering any firm information about the film&#x27;s progress.

&quot;We want it to happen,&quot; said Isaac. &quot;Be excited. What&#x27;s the script? What&#x27;s the story? What&#x27;s the take? [...] But hopeful that comes to fruition because there&#x27;s so much potential for that.&quot;

                              <span>Diablo Immortal players have hit back at Blizzard and are demanding refunds after the developer claimed an item in the game&#x27;s shop had a &quot;text description discrepancy&quot;.

Community manager SinfulScribe posted a comment on the game&#x27;s subreddit earlier this week, stating that thanks to &quot;the helpful efforts of the community&quot;, the team had identified the issue and deployed an update to rectify the error.

&quot;Through the helpful efforts of the community, we were alerted to a text description discrepancy with the Blessing of the Worthy Legendary Gem,&quot; they explained. &quot;At a certain rank, the gem&#x27;s description changed from &#x27;maximum life&#x27; to &#x27;current life&#x27; verbiage, leaving players reasonably confused on which of the two descriptions was intended.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players have identified a glitch with a Lucio skin that unwittingly lets other players see where they are.

u/FidgetSpinnetMan recently took to the Overwatch subreddit to report the issue, including an image that shows how Lucio&#x27;s Snow Fox skin and its icy visual effect can be seen from long distances across the map - including through walls (thanks, PCGN). 

&quot;BUG REPORT: I was playing a game and I noticed that the enemy Lucio was visible through the walls,&quot; they wrote in a post that has received two thousand upvotes. &quot;He used the Snow Fox skin and the weapon has smoke coming from it and it seems to be visible through the walls. Don&#x27;t use this skin because it gives you a positional disadvantage at all times.&quot;

                              <span>Silent Hill 2 translator Jeremy Blaustein is asking Konami to credit his work on the original Silent Hill 2 game in the remake, saying &quot;it&#x27;s the right this to do&quot;.

Blaustein says that while he does not &quot;expect or seek any financial compensation&quot;, &quot;I do strongly feel that giving me appropriate credit for my role is the right thing to do&quot;. 

Shortly after the remake was unveiled earlier this week, Blaustein retweeted Konami&#x27;s announcement, saying: &quot;Cool! And they will, once again, use the SH2 English script that I wrote/translated (oh, directed too) completely by myself and I will get zero compensation for it and there will not be tens of thousands of people on Twitter outraged on my behalf. Maybe I should make a video?&quot; The latter sentence refers to a dispute between Konami and Silent Hill 2&#x27;s voice artists around the time Silent Hill HD Collection was released back in 2012.

                              <span>Good news, Resident Evil fans: there&#x27;s still a chance a Resident Evil: Code Veronica remake may happen.

Although Resident Evil 4 producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi was keen to let everyone know that he is thoroughly committed to the Resident Evil 4 remake project for now, when asked by Noisy Pixel if the 22-year-old Resident Evil: Code Veronica may get a similar remake treatment, he said that if the &quot;opportunity comes, maybe&quot;.

Whilst hardly a cast-iron guarantee, it should be welcome news for Resident Evil fans, particularly as Code Veronica was a critical darling at the time and is still considered by some to be the &quot;real&quot; sequel to Resident Evil 2.

                              <span>Modern Warfare reboot&#x27;s Captain Price, Barry Sloane, says he pushed to give the iconic character a Liverpudlian accent.

In an interview with NME, Sloane talked about his respect for the character&#x27;s original voice actor, Billy Murray, and what it was like to &quot;physically embody&quot; the fan-favourite character.

&quot;Murray did an incredible performance, it was amazing,&quot; Sloane said. &quot;That’s why people give a fuck about Captain Price from the get-go.

If you haven&#x27;t yet come across Trombone Champ, you&#x27;re missing a treat. The &quot;world&#x27;s first trombone rhythm music game&quot;, it gives you the freedom to play any note at any time, and includes over 20 tracks, ranging from folk classics, anthems, marches, and classical music. 

You can also make your own custom tracks as demonstrated by Champer Gloomhonk, who has recently shared a new video set to the dulcent sounds of Truss&#x27;s resignation, which you can check out above.

                              <span>Overwatch players have taken to social media to ask why retailers still have Overwatch on sale when the game is no longer playable.

As u/raistwalls1 exemplifies on the Overwatch subreddit (thanks, TheGamer), retailers still have copies of Overwatch for both PS4 and Xbox One on sale - on this occasion, it&#x27;s priced at $34 - even though the game essentially no longer exists.

If you try to run a physical copy of Overwatch now, it&#x27;ll install the game but on launch it will transfer to Overwatch 2 which, crucially, is free to play.

                              <span>Interesting:
A recent study on giant squid that have washed ashore along the Sea of Japan coast has raised the possibility that the animal has a different reproductive method than many other types of squid.
Almost all squid and octopus species are polygamous, with multiple males passing sperm to a single female. Giant squids were thought to have a similar form reproduction.
However, a group led by Professor Noritaka Hirohashi, 57, a professor of reproductive biology in the Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences at Shimane University suspects differently...</span>

                              <span>Machine learning security is extraordinarily difficult because the attacks are so varied—and it seems that each new one is weirder than the next. Here’s the latest: a training-time attack that forces the model to exhibit a point of view: Spinning Language Models: Risks of Propaganda-As-A-Service and Countermeasures.”
Abstract: We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to “spin” their outputs so as to support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view—but only when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization...</span>

                              <span>Toukana Interactive&#x27;s sublime landscape-building puzzler Dorfromantik has just been updated on Steam, adding the Japan-inspired Sakura biome, controller support, and more.


Dorfromantik&#x27;s Sakura biome was previously exclusive to the recently released Switch version of the game, and today&#x27;s PC update - appropriately known as the Sakura Update - brings over a number of other features formerly only available on Nintendo&#x27;s platform.


Steam players can now, for instance, enjoy full controller support - which, among other things, helps massively improve what was previously a slightly fiddly experience on Steam Deck.

                              <span>A new Tomb Raider animation canonically explains how Lara Croft survived the events between Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and those of the series&#x27; sixth instalment, Angel of Darkness. 


 The Myth of El Hawa is written by Angel of Darkness scribe Murti Schofield, directed by veteran Tomb Raider fan Ash Kaprielov, and stars voice actress Jonell Elliott (who voiced Lara in several Tomb Raider games including Angel of Darkness and The Last Revelation). 


As for The Myth of El Hawa itself, this is told through Lara&#x27;s diary entries. These reveal how, following her fall into the collapsing temple of Horus at The Last Revelation&#x27;s close, Lara struggled to make her way out alive. However, make her way out she did, and on the brink of death she was found by a shaman named Putai.

                              <span>Blaze Entertainment, the company behind Evercade, has signed a deal to bring Amiga games to its retro consoles starting next year.


Evercade, for those unfamiliar, exists in two version: a home console known as the Evercade VS and the upcoming handheld Evercade EXP. Both are cartridge-based and support a library of 380 officially licensed classic titles, spanning over four decades.


At present, over 30 cartridge collections are available for Evercade, each bundling together a curated selection of retro games usually themed around a single developer - with the likes of Atari, Data East, Intellivision, The Bitmap Brothers, Gremlin, The Oliver Twins, and Interplay all currently represented through various deals.

                              <span>Microsoft is streamlining Discord server voice chat support on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S by ditching the feature&#x27;s convoluted mobile app requirement - a change currently going through Insider testing ahead of its public release.


Discord server voice chat support launched for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in September, making it possible for users to talk with their friends directly through Discord Voice chats, wherever they may be. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a pretty fiddly process in its current guise.


Users first need to link their Xbox and Discord accounts then download the Xbox mobile app to their phone - which must also be linked to a user&#x27;s console. Discord is then launched on mobile or desktop, and once a user has joined the Voice call they want to transfer to Xbox, they need to select the &#x27;transfer call&#x27; option. Next, hit the &#x27;confirm&#x27; button back in the mobile app, at which point it&#x27;s time to don a headset and start chatting via console.

                              <span>Sony has a range of graphical options for you to try in God of War Ragnarök, which essentially boil down to four settings.


First up, there are the ususal two modes which Sony here refers to as &quot;Favour Resolution&quot; and &quot;Favour Performance&quot;. 


The former sets your frame-rate and resolution to a targeted 30fps at 4K. The latter targets 60fps and uses a dynamic resolution upscaled to 4K.

As confirmed in last night&#x27;s RE Showcase, Ethan will turn his face away from the player when the camera is turned.



A demo of the game has been released ahead of the expansion release on 28th October, so I was keen to see this for myself.

Sega&#x27;s full Football Manager 2023 doesn&#x27;t launch until 8th November, but this early access build is basically the full thing, albeit with a warning of some yet-to-be-ironed-out &quot;bugs and issues&quot; still lingering behind the scenes.

                              <span>Will Wright, legendary creator of SimCity and The Sims, has discussed his plans for a metaverse game. 


The project, named Voxverse, will allow players to buy and own land  using cryptocurrency, and mine resources which can then be turned into items for sale.


Wright discussed the project with Axios alongside collaborator Lauren Elliot, the co-creator of Carmen Sandiego. Together, the pair have a blockchain-focused startup working on the game alongside engine maker Unity and NFT game platform Gala Games.

                              <span>Last night brought us our best look yet at Capcom&#x27;s ambitious Resident Evil 4 remake, which Eurogamer&#x27;s editor-in-chief Martin has now got hands-on time with.


In a separate round of interviews, Capcom staff have been discussing the project further - including the original&#x27;s slightly contentious inclusion of button-mashing quick-time events (QTEs).


The good news here is the Resi 4 remake will tone these down - and in-game cut-scenes will no longer force you to quickly pick up the controller and spam a button to avoid death.

                              <span>Nintendo 64 party games Mario Party 1 and 2 will be released on Nintendo Switch Online 2nd November.


Released in 1999 and 2000 respectively, these games launched the popular series that already has two Switch games. They are known for their popular themed boards and frantic minigames.


Both games were among a list of classics confirmed for the subscription service&#x27;s expansion pass. There&#x27;s no news yet on a release date for Goldeneye, however.

                              <span>PlatinumGames has offered its &quot;full support&quot; to Bayonetta 3 voice actress Jennifer Hale following the recent voice actress pay fiasco.


In the wake of original Bayonetta voice actress Hellena Taylor releasing a series of videos claiming she was only offered $4k to work on the third game, fans turned on Hale for accepting the role instead. She has since asked for kindness, tweeting &quot;let&#x27;s just be good to each other&quot;.




Platinum has echoed Hale&#x27;s request in its official statement, below in full.

                              <span>Capcom has given perhaps the best look yet at its highly anticipated Resident Evil 4 remake - and shared a little more on its various other Resident Evil projects - in its latest video showcase, with the remake getting both new gameplay footage and a new story trailer.


On the gameplay front, Capcom shared an action-packed couple of minutes of its RE4 remake, starting with a sequence from early in the game that sees protagonist Leon skulking through the woods before stumbling across a seemingly abandoned barn. It&#x27;s a suitably atmospheric sequence, showing off the remake&#x27;s various visual upgrades, and one that segues into a chaotic outdoor battle as Leon is swarmed by Ganado. Inevitably, things come to an end with our old friend chainsaw guy - but Leon somehow manages to keep his head on this time around.


Following its latest gameplay reveal, Capcom discussed the remake in a little more detail, explaining its goal is to &quot;[pay] respect to original game&#x27;s world while implementing new ideas and state of the art graphics to strengthen the core concepts of the title&quot;. This, it say, &quot;will provide a fresh experience with a sense of familiarity if you played the original, that both newcomers and veterans to Resident Evil 4 will enjoy&quot;.

                              <span>Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season, Eclipse, is right around the corner, and the usual promotional blitz is has begun ahead of its 1st November arrival - this time bringing a new cinematic trailer giving a first look at recently revealed new hero Catalyst&#x27;s goopy abilities.


Catalyst - an &quot;experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer&quot;, and the first trans Legend to join the Apex Legends&#x27; line-up - made her introductions earlier this week in a new animated episode of Stories from the Outlands. Here, we got a glimpse of her early years on the planet of Boreas - as she becomes unwittingly embroiled in an eco-terrorist plot to save Boreas&#x27; moon - but developer Respawn&#x27;s latest trailer skips ahead to Catalyst&#x27;s Apex Games debut.


There&#x27;s a lot for eagle-eyed Apex Legends fans to unpack in the new cinematic trailer - including a fair glimpse at what is almost certainly Season 15&#x27;s previously teased new moon map - but the focus is very much on Catalyst and her new abilities.

                              <span>Saturnalia - the striking new survival horror from acclaimed studio Santa Ragione - is free on the Epic Games Store next week, alongside Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.


Santa Ragione, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, previously released the celebrated likes of MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, but Saturnalia - which is heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - looks to be its most ambitious title yet, trapping players in an ancient village steeped in murky rituals and challenging them to uncover its many secrets.


Although a solo experience, players take control of four different characters as they investigate the village&#x27;s labyrinthine, and decidedly psychedelic, streets. If one character get captured - horrible things lurk in the shadows - players can switch to another and attempt a rescue, but once all four are dead, the village physically reconfigures itself for another attempt. Thankfully, narrative and puzzle progress is retained across game-overs.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is calling on the public to share its views regarding Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


This is the next in the CMA&#x27;s ongoing investigation into the acquisition, which entered Phase 2 at the start of September when the regulator decided the deal required more in-depth scrutiny.


Last week, as part of Phase 2, the CMA released its Issues Statement, detailing the focus of the inquiry&#x27;s second stage and setting out the potential areas of concern - known as &quot;theories of harm&quot; - it&#x27;s investigating. These relate to the acquisition&#x27;s impact on multi-game subscription services, the future of cloud gaming, and the availability of Activision content on rival platforms.

In each of the world&#x27;s warring kingdoms is a Dominant, an individual blessed with the power to summon dangerous Eikons.


The new trailer, called Ambition, introduces two new Dominants: Dion Lesage, the Dominant of Bahamut, and Barnabas Tharmr, The Dominant of Odin. Check it out below.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re chewing over last night&#x27;s Silent Hill: Transmission broadcast, and Konami&#x27;s big plans to relaunch its survival horror brand.

Silent Hill has lain dormant ever since Konami cancelled Silent Hills and unreleased Hideo Kojima&#x27;s PT demo. The question is, will anything announced last night live up to that? There was plenty on offer - a remake, a new game, several spin-offs and a movie - from an array of developers. Still, it often felt like we were seeing little in the way of concrete details - release dates and actual gameplay footage.

Will Konami&#x27;s sudden onslaught of Silent Hill bring about a fresh start for the series? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

This new Marathon project will take the form of a three-person squad-based extraction shooter, Insider-gaming reports, and is currently in a pre-alpha state. 


Perhaps unsurprisingly, there&#x27;s also suggestion of this new Marathon game being run as a live service, with season rewards and progression worked in. Eurogamer has contacted Bungie for comment.

                              <span>Battlefield 2042&#x27;s latest update arrives today, and tweaks yet another map. 


Update 2.2 reworks Orbital in a similar manner to how September&#x27;s patch reworked the (appropriately named) Renewal. Here, Battlefield developer DICE says it has &quot;improved gameplay flow&quot; and added more cover and assets, as well as various terrain improvements.


Another big addition to this update is that of persistent servers for Battlefield Portal, so your server will always remain available within the game&#x27;s server browser - even when there are no active players.

In the latest video in his YouTube series, series creator Masahiro Sakurai revealed new details on the conception of the first game in Nintendo&#x27;s hit fighting franchise and showed never before seen footage.


After the release of Kirby Super Star on the SNES, Sakurai began work on two different concepts: one, the fighting game that became Smash, and two a stealth-focused RC robot adventure game in which players hacked security cameras to progress.

                              <span>In light of the Queen&#x27;s passing, the team behind the upcoming Fallout: London mod for Fallout 4 has chosen to remove her &#x27;likeness&#x27;, and that of King Charles&#x27;, from development.
In a new progress video for the mod, project lead Dean Carter stated: &quot;We have always maintained that if [The Queen] was to pass away before the mod was complete, we would change it. As such, here is the official announcement to notify you all that, we are changing it&quot; (thanks, PC Gamer).
Carter did not elaborate on what the Fallout London team was going to change this all to, instead saying fans would have to hold tight and be patient on this front. He was quite adamant, however, the team would not bring  back its ghoulish Royal Family members in the future.

                              <span>The producer of Cyberpunk Edgerunners (and CD Projekt Red&#x27;s Japan country manager) Satoru Honma has confirmed that the anime is a &quot;standalone work&quot;.


In an interview with Famitsu (reported by PushSquare), Honma stated that a second season was not in the works.



&quot;I personally would like to continue to work with Japanese studios to produce more anime in the future, partly because we have received very good feedback. However, just to be clear, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was planned as a standalone work, so there&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;we are actually working on Season 2 in the background&#x27;,&quot; he said.

Scar&#x27;s arrival lets you hang out with the British-voiced baddie and extend Dreamlight&#x27;s overall narrative - which has you trying to puzzle out why its eponymous valley has fallen into ruin.


To get started with Scar, you&#x27;ll just need to head over to the giant skull in the elephant graveyard - which has now opened up to reveal a fresh lair.

This free update will add the long-awaited campaign network co-op mode, as well as the official launch of the game&#x27;s Forge beta (in case you missed it, some have already got their hands on it and have been creating some truly impressive reimaginings of games such as Ocarina of Time and PT within). 


In the campaign&#x27;s upcoming co-op mode, you will be able to have a whirl around Halo Infinite&#x27;s story with up to three other fellow Spartans. This will also be supported with the Mission Replay feature (finally), and 343 has revealed there will now be another 24 achievements to unlock in the game. As a reminder, this is not the local split-screen co-op, which the developer previously announced it had cancelled altogether.

                              <span>Long and interesting interview with Signal’s new president, Meredith Whittaker:
WhatsApp uses the Signal encryption protocol to provide encryption for its messages. That was absolutely a visionary choice that Brian and his team led back in the day ­- and big props to them for doing that. But you can’t just look at that and then stop at message protection. WhatsApp does not protect metadata the way that Signal does. Signal knows nothing about who you are. It doesn’t have your profile information and it has introduced group encryption protections.

Server-side apply (SSA) has now
been GA for a few releases, and I
have found myself in a number of conversations, recommending that people / teams
in various situations use it. So I’d like to write down some of those reasons.
Obvious (and not-so-obvious) benefits of SSA
A list of improvements / niceties you get from switching from various things to
Server-side apply!
Versus client-side-apply (that is, plain kubectl apply):

The system gives you conflicts when you accidentally fight with another
actor over the value of a field!
When combined with --dry-run, there’s no chance of accidentally running a

                              <span>As part of the Silent Hill: Transmission stream this evening, a new game known simply as Silent Hill f was announced. This marks the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade.


There are still very few details about this particular entry to the Silent Hill franchise. We do know its story is by Ryukishi07 (who created the When They Cry visual novel series), its characters and creatures are designed by Kera and its producer is Motoi Okamoto, whose name you may recognise from Nintendo.
Development duties are being handled by Neobards Entertainment, which has previously worked with Capcom as a support studio on several its Resident Evil games including Re:Verse.

                              <span>Konami finally unveiled everything it has cooking with Silent Hill, including a much-rumoured remake, a new movie and even brand new games in the famous horror series. In case you missed it, here&#x27;s a roundup of everything announced during the Silent Hill showcase, dubbed &#x27;Silent Hill Transmission&#x27;, including all the trailers.


First up, we got a debut trailer for Bloober Team&#x27;s much-rumoured Silent Hill 2 remake, which is set for PC via Steam and PlayStation 5. It&#x27;s listed as a PlayStation console exclusive for 12 months, which suggests it will hit Xbox a year after launch.


Next came the reveal of Silent Hill Townfall, developed by Stories Untold and Observation maker No Code alongside Annapurna Interactive. This one remains something of a mystery. Expect more in the new year.

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s big Silent Hill announcement bonanza wasn&#x27;t just about video games. Oh no. 


Alongside an array of Silent Hill game projects to look forward to, you should also be aware of a new Silent Hill film, set to follow the 2006 original that starred Sean Bean. 


Return to Silent Hill is the movie project we&#x27;ve heard whispers of previously from the original film&#x27;s director Christophe Gans. Tonight, Konami assistant producer Rui Naito confirmed this big screen follow-up was very much a thing that was happening - and indeed that it has actually been the &quot;catalyst&quot; for the new wave of Silent Hill games coming to fruition.

                              <span>After what feels like an eternity of leaks, Konami has officially revived its long-dormant Silent Hill series with a flurry of activity, starting with remake of horror masterpiece Silent Hill 2, which is being developed by Bloober Team for PC and PS5 as a timed console exclusive.


Bloober Team - the studio behind the likes of The Medium, Layers of Fear, and Observer - has been rumoured to be involved in a Silent Hill revival as far back as June last year, when it announced a partnership with Konami to create a new game. Rumours that the project would be a Silent Hill 2 remake began to coalesce following a series of leaks earlier this year.


Now, though, Konami and Bloober Team have made things official, revealing the remake during a busy Silent-Hill-focused livestream in a two-and-a-half minute trailer. Here, we were shown some iconic Silent Hill 2 moments given a new-gen visual overhaul - extending to a slightly dubious makeover for protagonist James Sunderland, who now looks a little like Alan Wake&#x27;s unpopular brother.

Not much has been revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie. &quot;Why are you here?&quot; he asks. &quot;Here to be punished... That&#x27;s good I like it. I think we&#x27;ve done something so awful that we are stuck here in this place being judged by these... people,&quot; he continues. 

The trailer ends with some frames of a man wearing glasses, before cutting to the logo of the game.

So, what do we expect? The rumour mill has certainly been churning, and it seems likely we&#x27;ll see Konami pull back the curtain on a number of Silent Hill projects set to bring back the survival horror franchise in a big way. There&#x27;s been word of a Silent Hill remake alongside all-new titles, and even a new Silent Hill movie.
How many games are we getting? Has Sony snaffled them all under some kind of timed exclusivity? Are they actuall all for mobile? We&#x27;ll find out in just a couple of hours.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s current Call of Duty marketing deal &quot;restricts&quot; Activision&#x27;s big-budget shooter series from appearing in Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft has claimed.


The detail comes from Xbox&#x27;s full response to last week&#x27;s filing by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, in which the regulator raised its current concerns regarding Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing $68bn takeover attempt of Activision Blizzard.

Sony&#x27;s existing marketing deal with Call of Duty sees the PlayStation branding used in conjunction with advertising, while players on Sony platforms get early access to in-game content.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been holding out for a Steam release of Crytek&#x27;s Crysis Remastered Trilogy, there&#x27;s some good news; the three-game spruce up is coming to Valve&#x27;s storefront on 17th November.


The Crysis Remastered Trilogy, if this all seems a little like déjà vu, first released for PlayStation, Switch, and PC last October, but the PC version was limited to the Epic Games Store - despite the remaster of the original Crysis already having been launched on Steam.


Come November, though, Steam players will also have the opportunity to check out Crytek&#x27;s remasters of Crysis 2 and 3, with all three games bundled into one package featuring various tweaks and enhancements for their respective single-player campaigns.

                              <span>Yesterday, I popped over to The Trafford Centre to check out Pokémon: Art Through the Ages.


The event, which was announced last month, is styled as a treasure hunt and requires you to look around The Trafford Centre for pictures and paintings of Pokémon. It features all 151 species from the Kanto Pokédex, with some small activities dotted around to get you exploring.


For anyone who&#x27;s not aware of The Trafford Centre (TTC), it&#x27;s a big shopping and leisure complex in Manchester. As well as shops, there&#x27;s also an Odeon, a Namco Funscape, and even a Sea Life aquarium and Legoland Discovery Centre.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly building an Xbox mobile gaming store in direct competition with Apple and Google.


The news, as reported by The Verge, has emerged due to filings from the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.




Both the popularity of Activision&#x27;s mobile games and the inclusion of King are major factors in Microsoft&#x27;s buyout as it looks to expand the Xbox brand further into mobile gaming.

Now, as a touching tribute to the designer&#x27;s work and legacy, many fans have taken to Fallout 76 to express their sorrow at his passing, and to bid him farewell.


Sharing on Twitter using the hashtag &quot;ThanksFerret&quot;, fans have created in-game homages to Baudoin.

The furore around the game&#x27;s voice actresses has been raised once more after new claims surfaced disputing that original Bayonetta voice actress Hellena Taylor was offered just $4k to work on the third game.




The debate has fired up both passion and negativity on all sides: towards Taylor, Platinum Games, and Hale, who was somewhat unwittingly dragged into the fiasco.

Their petition to the US National Labor Relations Board has now been accepted, setting the stage for a vote by employees to formalise the process. Ballots will be sent out as soon as next week, Kotaku reported, with a result due on 18th November.


Activision Blizzard had previously argued against this process going ahead, and claimed it should be a decision made by a larger group of employees at the Albany studio rather than its testing team. Ultimately, the NLRB disagreed.

                              <span>The recommended PC specs for Gotham Knights have been confirmed, ahead of the game&#x27;s release on Friday, and have raised eyebrows for some of their requirements.

The specs were shared on Twitter last night, just days before the game&#x27;s launch this Friday. 

The game&#x27;s Steam listing has been updated to reflect the specs, alongside the minimum requirements for PC which publisher Warner Bros. previously confirmed earlier in the week.

                              <span>Ahead of its imminent release, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 team has detailed its all-important PC specs.


In addition to these specs, Infinity Ward has also announced those who pre-ordered the game digitally will be able to get their preloads on the go from today (19th October). This will in turn offer up those eight days of early campaign access announced in August, which will go live tomorrow.


Meanwhile, preloading for the full release (which, unlike the early access mentioned above, will include the multiplayer and Special Ops elements) can begin from the 26th October ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch on the 27th/28th, depending on where you are playing.

Responding last night to some confusion over the game&#x27;s release date, the official Callisto Protocol account on Twitter reconfirmed the space survival horror&#x27;s 2nd December launch. 


&quot;And yes, we&#x27;ll have a 60 FPS performance mode,&quot; the tweet added.

                              <span>Interesting interview:
Banks don’t take millions of dollars and put them in plastic bags and hang them on the wall so everybody can walk right up to them. But we do basically the same thing in museums and hang the assets right out on the wall. So it’s our job, then, to either use technology or develop technology that protects the art, to hire honest guards that are trainable and able to meet the challenge and alert and so forth. And we have to keep them alert because it’s the world’s most boring job. It might be great for you to go to a museum and see it for a day, but they stand in that same gallery year after year, and so they get mental fatigue. And so we have to rotate them around and give them responsibilities that keep them stimulated and keep them fresh...</span>

                              <span>As Netflix&#x27;s gaming strategy grows ever bolder following its first tentative steps into the market, the streaming service has now revealed it&#x27;s &quot;seriously exploring&quot; its own cloud gaming offering.


That&#x27;s according to Netflix&#x27;s vice president of gaming Mike Verdu, who, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt (thanks TechCrunch), explained the company saw the technology as &quot;a value add&quot; for subscribers. &quot;We&#x27;re not asking you to subscribe as a console replacement. It&#x27;s a completely different business model. The hope is over time that it just becomes this very natural way to play games where wherever you are.&quot;


Addressing the elephant in the room - the dramatic failure of Google&#x27;s game streaming service Stadia, which will cease operations in January, a little over three years after its initial launch - Verdu noted that while Stadia was a &quot;technical success&quot; and was &quot;fun to play games on&quot;, &quot;it had some issues with the business model.&quot;

Perhaps, first, a quick introduction for those who&#x27;ve yet to experienced the marvels of Guildford High Street for themselves; it&#x27;s the epicentre of a small town situated around 40 miles south-west of London that just so happens to be a thriving hub for the UK&#x27;s game development scene.


Poke around and you&#x27;ll find the likes of Supermassive, Media Molecule, EA, Room developer Fireproof Games, Criterion, Ubisoft - and, of course, No Man&#x27;s Sky developer Hello Games.

                              <span>New reports have emerged disputing claims made by original Bayonetta voice actor Hellena Taylor that developer PlatinumGames was only willing to offer her a total of $4k to reprise her role in the series&#x27; upcoming third instalment.


Taylor - who has been replaced by voice actor Jennifer Hale for Bayonetta 3 - made the claim in a series of emotional videos shared on Twitter this weekend, citing Platinum&#x27;s &quot;insulting [pay] offer&quot; as the reason for her absence in the third game.


&quot;I didn&#x27;t want the world, I didn&#x27;t ask for too much,&quot; she said in one video. &quot;I was just asking for a decent, dignified living wage. What they did was legal, but it was immoral.&quot; Taylor also called for a boycott of Bayonetta 3, suggesting fans instead donated their money to charity.

                              <span>As part of its first ever Behind the Sims Summit Stream event, EA has given a &quot;super early&quot; look at its next Sims game, codenamed Project Rene, and shared a few future plans for The Sims 4.


Project Rene - a name EA says it chose to reflect words like &quot;renewal, renaissance, rebirth&quot; - is described as a &quot;next generation Sims game and creative platform&quot; that will &quot;[reimagine] the Sims you know and love with new ways to play&quot;.


It&#x27;s said to be built on a foundation of &quot;charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories&quot; that will stay true to previous Sims games while also &quot;pushing to evolve how those Sims think and behave, [pushing] tools even further when creating and customising, and [exploring] innovative ways to not only tell stories but to collaborate on those stories or creations with your closest friends across your favourite devices.&quot;

What that actually means in practice isn&#x27;t immediately clear from the trailer&#x27;s rapid cuts and overbearing stylings, but EA sheds more light on the matter in an accompanying press release.


&quot;In Need for Speed Unbound,&quot; it explains, &quot;players have to take risks to get to the top. Choose how and when to put it all on the line, pulling huge drifts on the street, outdriving the cops, or placing side bets with their own earnings against rival racers.&quot;

Developed by NetherRealm Studios and known as Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, this game will make its debut in 2023 and provide users with their first &quot;mobile-exclusive cinematic story experience&quot; for the series. 


On its release next year, players will be tasked with building up their team of fighters (of which there will be a &quot;vast roster&quot; of characters to pick from) in a bid to stop a &quot;dark and dangerous threat from wreaking havoc across the realms.&quot; This will all be done via real-time group battles.

YouTuber Red Nomster is known for creating Forge maps, but this might just be their best yet (as spotted by GamesRadar).


All the obvious features are included, from Link&#x27;s house, to the item shop and the layout of tree houses and walkways.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption has left PlayStation&#x27;s streaming service after six years of availability. 


Sony&#x27;s service - now part of the newly-revamped PS Plus Premium, though formerly the separate PlayStation Now subscription - has been home to Red Dead Redemption since 2016.


Its departure means there is now no way to play Rockstar&#x27;s original cowboy epic on PS4 or PS5.

                              <span>Bethesda could be bringing back its most infamous Elder Scrolls NPC in its forthcoming sci-fi RPG Starfield.


In a recent Q&amp;A with director Todd Howard, details were given on the game&#x27;s trait system. Each trait comes with positives and negatives, as well as an accompanying side quest to remove them.



As PCGamesN spotted, one of these traits is called &quot;Hero Worshipped&quot; in which the player has &quot;earned the attention of an annoying &#x27;Adoring Fan&#x27; who will show up randomly and jabber at you incessantly. On the plus side, he&#x27;ll give you gifts...&quot;  See for yourself in the below video at the 3:17 mark.

The usual array of in-game quests will offer a smattering of free cosmetics, but you&#x27;ll need to cough up in the game&#x27;s item shop to buy the Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, plus both Meeseeks and Queen Summer from Rick &amp; Morty.

On 9th November, both Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars for Xbox 360 (including its Kane&#x27;s Wrath expansion) will see their online services shut  down. 
Red Alert 3, as I am sure you are all aware, is most famous for Tim Curry&#x27;s exuberant proclamation that he&#x27;s headed to space as it is the one place not corrupted by capitalism. That&#x27;s always a fun clip to replay.

Capcom has stated it&#x27;s now working on a fix.

Coder Ryan Dwyer is behind this, working on both the launch NTSC version and a later re-release that fixed various bugs (thanks VGC).


We can now expect PC players to have plenty of fun improving the visuals of the game, or simply messing around with Joanna Dark, Elvis the alien and more.

Business Insider reported that hundreds - but less than 1000 - staff have been affected. 


&quot;Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis, and make structural adjustments accordingly,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson told Eurogamer today. &quot;We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead.&quot;

Everyone travelling to Qatar during the football World Cup will be asked to download two apps called Ehteraz and Hayya.
Briefly, Ehteraz is an covid-19 tracking app, while Hayya is an official World Cup app used to keep track of match tickets and to access the free Metro in Qatar.
In particular, the covid-19 app Ehteraz asks for access to several rights on your mobile., like access to read, delete or change all content on the phone, as well as access to connect to WiFi and Bluetooth, override other apps and prevent the phone from switching off to sleep mode...</span>

As detailed on Twitter, the publisher will be broadcasting its latest Resident Evil showcase via Twitch this Thursday, with proceedings set to get underway at 11pm UK time - which, if you&#x27;re watching from the US, equates to 3pm PDT and 6pm EDT.


Capcom hasn&#x27;t shared much in the way of specifics, only saying it&#x27;ll be detailing the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition - which arrives on 28th October, bundling together the base game and upcoming Winters Expansion DLC  - as well as its Resident Evil 4 remake, and &quot;more&quot;.

                              <span>In the not entirely unlikely event you&#x27;ve been clamouring for a bit more jazz in your Elden Ring soundtrack, Bandai Namco has the answer. It&#x27;s announced it&#x27;ll be hosting a live concert this December that, for those in the US willing to pay for it, will be streamed online.


Elden Ring: A Night in the Lands Between, as the event will be known, is a collaboration between Bandai Namco, award-winning musician Kenny Garrett, and Takuya Kuroda. It promises &quot;recognisable melodies from the game&#x27;s soundtrack... performed live in Jazz format - with improvisation&quot; by a group of musicians lead by Garrett on alto sax and Kuroda on trumpet.


&quot;While video game soundtracks have seen variations as symphonic music and even Rock n&#x27; Roll, our &#x27;A Night in the Lands Between&#x27; Jazz event is exploring a wonderfully different treatment of the Elden Ring soundtrack&quot;, wrote Bandai Namco&#x27;s senior director of esports and live entertainment Wataru Nakasuji in a statement accompanying today&#x27;s announcement.

Details of the new season, which Respawn is calling Eclipse, are a little light at present, but the developer&#x27;s newly launched Season 15 webpage promises a new map - said to be lie &quot;in Boreas&#x27; shadow&quot; - as well as a new gifting feature, enabling players to purchase and send cosmetic items to their friends.


For now, though, the focus is very much on new hero Catalyst, real name Tressa Smith, described as a &quot;experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer  [who] uses her remarkable control of ferrofluid to manipulate the battlefield.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has announced it&#x27;ll be bringing its Switch Sports servers back online tomorrow, 18th October, with players affected by the recent downtime getting an extra week added to their Nintendo Switch Online membership.


Switch Sports&#x27; servers were taking offline and save data backups were suspended on Friday, while Nintendo investigated a significant bug introduced in last week&#x27;s 1.2.1 update that caused crashes on the game&#x27;s pre-match loading screen, during both online and offline play.


Servers and save data backup functionality have remained unavailable since then, but Nintendo Japan has now offered an update on its website (thanks VGC), confirming the crashing was caused by a save writing error under certain conditions and revealing it&#x27;ll be restoring all functionality across two waves later this week.

                              <span>PQube and Toge Productions have come to a financial agreement following a disagreement over the use of funds.


Back in August, Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions accused publisher PQube of misusing money gained from a diversity fund. Toge claimed this money was intended to finance its next game A Space For The Unbound.



&quot;The diversity fund was a grant fund intended to help underrepresented game developers, especially during the pandemic,&quot; Toge Productions wrote at the time. &quot;However, instead of giving those funds to the developers as the grant was intended, PQube Games intentionally withheld information about the grant and used it as a leverage for their own commercial gain.

Each item in this collection has been influenced by the game, with elements such as Forbidden West&#x27;s key art and homages to Aloy&#x27;s in-game looks included throughout each piece.

                              <span>Pokémon Go has launched a new kind of raid activity - Elite Raids - designed to test players&#x27; mettle in return for ultra-rare creatures.


Beyond being a test for players with a buffed-up Pokémon team, Elite Raids also seem like Pokémon Go developer Niantic&#x27;s latest nudge to get users back outside in big numbers, generating the kind of crowds you might see playing pre-pandemic.


The first evidence of Elite Raids began popping up in-game on Friday, with an extended 24-hour countdown clock on some Pokémon gyms and a flashy new raid egg on the game&#x27;s map. A message stated these raids would require players to take part in-person at the raid site itself, rather than using a Remote Raid Pass to join from the sofa.

That includes adjusting the volume of various sound effects and adding a &quot;distance to opponent&quot; sound.

The incident occurred at a Gladiators-style foam pit stand sponsored by Lenovo, where Chechik jumped into the pit and was left severely injured. Several others were also injured.


Chechik has been sharing updates on her recovery on social media, confirming she had a second round of surgery on 14th October - almost a week after the incident.

                              <span>This weekend saw Minecraft developer Mojang make numerous announcements as part of its annual Minecraft Live celebration - including the first details of 2023&#x27;s big vanilla Minecraft update.


But in a change to tradition, we didn&#x27;t get a title for the update or its full list of additions - in response to the fact Mojang has  struggled in the past to deliver everything it has previously promised. 


For now, Minecraft&#x27;s 2023 update is being referred to as &quot;Minecraft 1.20&quot;, and is confirmed to feature camels, hanging signs, chiseled bookshelves and bamboo crafting - including the ability to build a bamboo raft. Camels look a particularly interesting addition - as they can jump fair distances and fit two players riding on top.

                              <span>Gotham Knights will be limited to 30FPS and not include a performance mode for consoles on its release later this month. 


This news was confirmed by Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer Fleur Marty via Discord. Here, Marty explained this was &quot;due to the types of features&quot; included in the game, adding the additional option of a performance mode would not have been &quot;as straightforward as lowering the resolution and getting a higher FPS&quot;.


Marty highlighted the game&#x27;s &quot;highly detailed&quot; open-world setting and its untethered co-op gameplay as two of the reasons the upcoming game does not &quot;have a performance/quality toggle option&quot;. She concluded by confirming Gotham Knights will run at 30FPS on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 (the developer previously confirmed it had canned the planned PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game).

                              <span>Konami horror project P.T. has been made playable on a PlayStation 5, via a hacked PS4 emulator.


Streamer and dataminer Lance McDonald has managed to get the game working on a non-jailbroken PS5 console.


Essentially, a legitimate copy of P.T. is required as well as an active PSN account on both a jailbroken PS5 and a normal, fully updated PS5. The emulator is then transferred from one to the other.

                              <span>UPDATE 9.26pm: New Bayonetta voice actor Jennifer Hale has shared a statement in response to a series of videos from original voice actor Hellena Taylor which highlighted the &quot;insulting&quot; salary offer made by Platinum Games to reprise the lead role in Bayonetta 3.


&quot;As a longtime member of the voice acting community,&quot; Hale wrote on Twitter, &quot;I support every actor&#x27;s right to be paid well and have advocated consistently for this for years.


&quot;Anyone who knows me or has followed my career, will know that I have great respect for my peers, and that I am an advocate for all members of the community.

The criminals targeted vehicles with keyless entry and start systems, exploiting the technology to get into the car and drive away.
As a result of a coordinated action carried out on 10 October in the three countries involved, 31 suspects were arrested. A total of 22 locations were searched, and over EUR 1 098 500 in criminal assets seized.
The criminals targeted keyless vehicles from two French car manufacturers. A fraudulent tool—marketed as an automotive diagnostic solution, was used to replace the original software of the vehicles, allowing the doors to be opened and the ignition to be started without the actual key fob...</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s finally happening. A decade on from the last full Silent Hill game, the survival horror franchise is making a long-awaited comback. 


The future of the Silent Hill series will be unveiled this week - on Wednesday at 10pm here in the UK. 


&quot;In your restless dreams, do you see that town?&quot; the official Silent Hill Twitter account teased this evening. &quot;The latest updates for the Silent series, will be revealed during the #SilentHill Transmission on Wednesday, 19th October at 2pm PDT.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Media Molecule&#x27;s impressively flexible PlayStation creation tool Dreams is celebrating Halloween this year with the return of its annual All Hallows&#x27; event, this time beckoning players to take a spooky trip to the Land of Lost Dreams.


This latest journey to the realms of spookidom is the third Halloween event for Dreams, following previous outings that saw Media Molecule collaborating with its community to create explorable haunted houses and then, last year, a creepy old fairground.


Things are getting a little more fantastical this time around, however, with a quest to the far-flung Land of Lost Dreams, where players can embark on a quest full of odd characters and puzzles as they attempt to uncover a &quot;rich and unnerving history&quot;.

Switch Sports&#x27; version 1.2.1 update launched earlier this week, aiming to further strengthen measures against what Nintendo called &quot;disruptive behaviours&quot; online, as well as pledging to suspend any online players violating its Community Guidelines. Punishable actions included &quot;fraudulent behaviour such as save data manipulation.&quot;


Unfortunately, patch 1.2.1 also introduced a significant bug causing crashes - whether playing online or offline - during the pre-match loading screen.

                              <span>OlliOlli World is poised to receive its second and final expansion on 2nd November - and developer Roll7 has offered a closer look at its skybound skating hijinks ahead of its arrival.


Finding The Flowzone, as the new expansion is known, takes OlliOlli World&#x27;s acclaimed skating action high above Radlandia, with players roaming the clouds in a fantastical floating boat alongside the infamous Radmospheric Three - &quot;grizzled sea-dog Captain Squid, the prim and proper Professor Planks, and the mystically inclined Christopher Licht&quot;. 


Ultimately, the goal is to reach the fabled city of Radlantis, meet the legendary Gail Force, and compete before the Skate Godz to earn the Radlantis Rivals Cup. First, though, players must complete courses set among the clouds, with some familiar Radlandia sights providing the backdrop.

                              <span>&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it&#x27;s not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we&#x27;re pressing the &#x27;unlaunch&#x27; button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th,&quot; says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases, hinting that it&#x27;ll be renamed when it does eventually re-emerge. RTX 4070 Ti anyone?
Unveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC&#x27;s 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it&#x27;s fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.
The table below reveals that the spec differential wasn&#x27;t just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.

                              <span>EA Motive has been uncommonly talkative throughout the development of its Dead Space remake, with the studio hosting various livestreams to show off the likes of its improved art, audio, and gameplay changes - but now, with the game&#x27;s 27th January launch inching ever nearer, we&#x27;ve had our clearest look yet at how all those elements will come together, courtesy of a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough.


Hot on the heels of last week&#x27;s 2-minute gameplay trailer, EA celebrated Dead Space&#x27;s 14th anniversary today with an extended sequence from the remake&#x27;s third chapter, in which protagonist Isaac must explore the infested USG Ishimura in order to reach the ship&#x27;s engineering deck take and repair its engines.


The sequence began in Ishimura&#x27;s hanger - an area that&#x27;s now much bigger than it was in the original (a side-by-side comparison made the differences abundantly clear) - with players now able to zero-g their way around the area. Some of remake&#x27;s environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.

                              <span>Pokémon Go&#x27;s annual Halloween event is often one of its best activities and, as expected, this year features a number of new bits and pieces in-game. The event&#x27;s first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. 


 These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.


Niantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure.

                              <span>After eight years, the Destiny franchise is moving on from its various destination materials - the Spinmetal, Helium Filaments and Relic Iron you could zoom around on your Sparrow vehicle and harvest while patrolling the series&#x27; many planets and moons.


Some of my earliest memories from Destiny 1 are of looping the Cosmodrome for Spinmetal Leaves, hopping off my Sparrow to gather them, then heading off to the next node. Levelling your gear - which in turn levels your character - required plugging bits of these resources in, and I don&#x27;t want to think about the number of hours I spent grinding these out.


Now, or rather as of Destiny 2&#x27;s upcoming Season 19, the materials themselves will no longer be available to acquire - although you can still go zooming around on your Sparrow if you want to.

As Serebii.net reports, the Wild Area News will receive a final update on 1st November to add Pokémon not usually available, such as Gigantamax Snorlax.


Also, from this date the Battle Stadium will no longer update with a ranked season and results will not appear in Pokémon Home.

                              <span>Today brings another new Pokémon set to debut in the upcoming Scarlet and Violet games for Nintendo Switch:  Bellibolt, an electric-type frog.

A couple of days ago, a teaser was released where Iono, a new gym leader character described as an influencer and livestreamer within the Pokémon universe, asked viewers to guess what her partner Pokémon was.

We were given the following clues: appearance-wise it&#x27;s squishy, sluggish with an easygoing vibe, and has &quot;two big ol&#x27; bumps on its noggin that people always mistake for eyes&quot;. And it&#x27;s &quot;so cute&quot;, according to Iono.

The project is being lead by Dominic Guay, a 20-year veteran of Ubisoft who worked on Splinter Cell before rising to become senior producer of Watch Dogs and its sequel.


Invoke owner and D&amp;D publisher Wizards of the Coast announced the new project this week with only a few details: that it will have a triple-A scope, and be developed on the Unreal 5 engine.

In its latest developer blog post, Blizzard detailed its &quot;current thinking on hero balance and gameplay&quot;, including map rotation and player ranking.


&quot;While some heroes are performing better than others, and there are differences across player skill levels, we have been happy to see that no hero&#x27;s overall power level is far out of line with our goals,&quot; Blizzard said.

The game will be a collaboration between Baby Shark Games, a subsidiary of Pinkfong, and Retro Future, a developer who specialises in pixel games.

As shared via Nintendo of America&#x27;s own Twitter, this latest foray into the world of Mario inspired timepieces introduces us to two new watches. 


The first is the standard Chronograph, which is limited to 3000 pieces. This watch features several Mario Kart references across its face, including icons of Power Stars and the like where you would usually see the date showing up. Meanwhile, the Mario Kart logo can be seen etched on the back.

                              <span>The latest Elden Ring patch, released yesterday, appears to have references to visual features and potential DLC.


As dataminer and streamer Lance McDonald shared on Twitter, menu strings were found (by sennoutantei) relating to ray tracing features. 


What&#x27;s more, references have been found to two new maps that don&#x27;t yet exist in the game.

                              <span>New Call of Duty players on PC will still need to verify their identity via an SMS message - even though Activision&#x27;s other half Blizzard rolled back the unpopular requirement for Overwatch 2 following its beleaguered launch.


In a new blog post, Activision confirmed it would require a text-enabled mobile phone number to play the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on PC, and also Warzone 2.0.


This will not apply on console, however, or to anyone on PC who verified their account to play the existing Warzone previously.

And, we know now that Toad will have a small musical number in the film, revealed by Keegan-Michael Key.

Key, who studied theatre at university, has sung on-screen previously in the TV series Schmigadoon! and Netflix&#x27;s Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey.

                              <span>UPDATE 2.30pm UK Silent Hill&#x27;s Masahiro Ito has now added, via Twitter, he was referring to &quot;the background setting&quot; of Pyramid Head as &quot;the executioner in the town&quot; from Braveheart - although the design itself comes from his early art student designs, as shown below.
ORIGINAL STORY 11.45am UK:
Silent Hill is an unsettling series across the board, there&#x27;s no denying that - and the silhouette of its fan-favourite Pyramid Head is enough to induce nightmares. 


Now we know more about how this monstrous humanoid came to be, at least in terms of his conception - and it turns out he was inspired by background characters from the 1995 film Braveheart.

In a Twitlonger statement, Jehiel detailed how Simons would regularly threaten to reveal his genitals despite frequent requests not to.

The game&#x27;s developer Asobo has now warned those with early copies not to ruin Requiem&#x27;s story - posting a picture of a knight being consumed by thousands of plague rats as a warning of what will happen should you spoil things for others.


Digital copies of the game will unlock at midnight local time next Tuesday, 18th October, but it appears some early physical copies have been sent out early. Eurogamer has spotted some big spoilers doing the rounds - so be careful where you click if you want to go in blind.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re back discussing Microsoft&#x27;s big Activision Blizzard deal and the latest developments in the ongoing saga of the $68bn buyout being finalised.

Yesterday, Microsoft leapt upon the latest concerned update from the UK&#x27;s deal regulator and repeatedly tried to minimise its own importance in the video games market. Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation&#x27;s userbase would be &quot;significantly larger&quot; than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony&#x27;s own complaints about the deal at face value. 

Is this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead.

                              <span>In August, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the cryptocurrency platform Tornado Cash, a virtual currency “mixer” designed to make it harder to trace cryptocurrency transactions—and a worldwide favorite money-laundering platform. Americans are now forbidden from using it. According to the US government, Tornado Cash was sanctioned because it allegedly laundered over $7 billion in cryptocurrency, $455 million of which was stolen by a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.
Tornado Cash is not a traditional company run by human beings, but instead a series of “smart contracts”: self-executing code that exists only as software. ...</span>

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence, the new narrative adventure from developer Dramatic Labs, will no longer release this year as originally planned and is now expected to arrive on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation in April 2023.


Resurgence, which was announced at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, takes place after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, telling its story from the alternating perspectives of two different characters - First Officer Jara Rydek and Engineering Crewperson Carter Diaz - with gameplay said to consist of playable cinematic sequences.


Everything shown so far points to an experience very much in the same vein as the interactive narrative adventures pioneered by Telltale Games - which isn&#x27;t particularly surprising given that Dramatic Labs was founded by controversial former Telltale Games boss Kevin Bruner, and includes around 20 former Telltale employees.

Aurora - who performed the haunting vocal accompaniment to Idina Menzel in Frozen 2&#x27;s showstopper Into the Unknown, and whose singles include Cure for Me and Runaway - has been heard in Sky before, but she&#x27;ll play a much greater role in its latest season of content.


Appropriately titled Season of Aurora, this will feature a &quot;story told in music&quot; where players can explore the &quot;song-filled memories of Spirits who carried hope through struggle and loss&quot;.

                              <span>If you can somehow still look at your gaming backlog without being consumed by existential dread, here&#x27;s another two additions for your infinitely expanding pile: Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition and Evoland Legendary Edition, both free next week on the Epic Games Store.


Fallout 3 likely needs no introduction, given its lofty place in the gaming pantheon. Released back in 2008, it was Bethesda&#x27;s first foray into the Fallout universe (1 and 2 were the work of Black Isle Studios), expanding on the open-world RPG freedom of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion to deliver a sprawling, dizzyingly rich post-apocalyptic jaunt through The Capital Wasteland.


An &quot;embarrassment of riches&quot; is what Eurogamer called Fallout 3 in 2008, describing it as a &quot;thrilling, all-consuming experience that will absorb you for weeks... as you fall in love with the relentless excitement, incredible atmosphere, sense of place and sheer choice.&quot; The Game of the Year Edition being given away on Epic includes the base game and all its DLC.

                              <span>Developer Insomniac Games&#x27; formerly PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be coming to PC on 18th November - and ahead of its release, Sony has detailed the PC port&#x27;s system-specific features and requirements.


In case it somehow wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the Miles-Morales-starring follow-up to Insomniac&#x27;s original Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, taking the first game&#x27;s acclaimed web-swinging open-world action and infusing it with a new hero and a bit of snowy, seasonal jollity thanks to its year-end setting.


&quot;Insomniac&#x27;s second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original,&quot; said Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robinson in his Recommended review, &quot;but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too.&quot;

                              <span>The growing popularity of digital purchases has had the unintended effect of breaking down regional pricing barriers designed to keep games affordable all over the world. 


This is due to &quot;region-hopping&quot; - a tactic used by those seeking to take advantage of lower prices in other countries, as publishers adjust the price of games in each region based on median incomes. 


The trouble with this is it means customers from richer economies can also loophole themselves into grabbing a game for significantly cheaper than their own local pricing.

The service launched back in February 2021 for games to be validated against the Xbox accessibility guidelines and accessibility tags applied. Now, developers can gain feedback from disabled players testing their games.


Microsoft announced this news at today&#x27;s Xbox Accessibility Showcase, celebrating the disability community and those making gaming more accessible.

This agreement with the US National Labor Relations Board concludes Clifton&#x27;s long-running dispute with Nintendo and its contractor agency Aston Carter, through which they were employed to test Nintendo games. 


As part of the deal, Nintendo must also display a notice informing employees (in block capital letters) they &quot;WILL NOT&quot; be fired or stopped from discussing unionisation.

                              <span>Bart and Milhouse often have a rough time of it throughout The Simpsons&#x27; many episodes and seasons. The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. 
However, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as &quot;The Springfield Files.&quot;

This episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer&#x27;s conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner&#x27;s Waterworld.

Walther is widely known for their detailed and excellent Bloodborne PSX demake, and has been working on the racing project since March.

Their latest update shows off Gehrman, the elderly gentleman who hangs around the workshop inside the Hunter&#x27;s Dream, though I suspect he&#x27;s been modding his ride a bit.

                              <span>Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson is making a second appearance in Fortnite - this time as his DC Comics alter ego Black Adam.


The Rock, of course, already exists in Fortnite as one of the game&#x27;s original characters - The Foundation - and has leant his role and likeness to the hero since March last year. 


Now he&#x27;ll appear in character as Black Adam, to tie in with his appearance in the film of the same name, which is set to launch in cinemas next week.

                              <span>Last month Google Stadia officially announced it will shut down its beleaguered cloud gaming service for good in January next year.


Now, in light of this news, the developer behind top-down party battle game and Google Stadia exclusive Outcasters has informed its players that, at this point in time, it &quot;does not have plans to bring [the game] to other platforms&quot;.


In a statement on Twitter, British developer Splash Damage explained that as Outcasters was both designed and built with Stadia specifically in mind, the game&#x27;s systems were &quot;heavily reliant on the platform&quot; and the work required to release it on a different platform was simply too complex at this time.

Details of its rewards are now live on PlayStation&#x27;s UK site, and mirror those available elsewhere. 


This includes the fact some users will &quot;randomly&quot; be placed in a queue for up to two months upon applying to the scheme in order to manage demand. It also includes a perk which will give you &quot;priority&quot; when contacting PlayStation&#x27;s customer support chat.

This latest complaint, filed in Los Angeles by a former employee of the company referred to as Jane Doe, targets both the Call of Duty maker itself and the employee&#x27;s former manager, Miguel Vega. 

Doe is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against the company and her ex-manager. In addition to this, Doe has demanded the removal of Bobby Kotick as CEO, as part of the lawsuit.

The surprising U-turn comes after esports were piloted at the 2022 Games held in Birmingham. 


The pilot was co-funded by the Commonwealth Games Federation (GF) and the Global Esports Federation (GEF). At the time, the CGF called the pilot a success and expected esports to be held at future Games.

These adjustments do not affect single-player or cooperative play.

It took 98 weeks to reach this number, in-line with sales of the PS3 and making it the joint fourth fastest-selling console in the UK.


Since launch, the console has been hampered with stock shortage issues and remains in high demand. That&#x27;s despite a price increase for UK consumers of £30 back in August, which Sony blamed on inflation.

FIFA 23 owners on PlayStation 5 have posted screenshots of the mode on social media, which show four different sub-modes: FIFA World Cup Live, FIFA World Cup Kick-Off, Online Tournament and FIFA World Cup 2022.

                              <span>Sony may have accidentally revealed that PlayStation classic Ridge Racer 2 is on its way to PS Plus.


Yesterday, Sony announced the next slate of games coming to the subscription service in October, including Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Dragon Quest 11, and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.


PlayStation Access, the official PlayStation YouTube channel, included Ridge Racer 2 in its list of classic games, but this was not included in the PlayStation Blog. The PlayStation Access video has since been updated (thanks VGC).

                              <span>EA has triumphantly termed the recently-released FIFA 23 as &quot;record-breaking&quot; - for hitting 10.3 million players in its first week, and having the &quot;biggest launch period in EA Sports FIFA franchise history&quot;.


FIFA 23 is, of course, also the last EA Sports FIFA franchise release in history - with the series set to transition to EA Sports FC from next year. 


Signs were good that FIFA 23 had performed well at launch this year. Launched on 30th September, the game&#x27;s first week of UK boxed game sales slightly beat those of FIFA 22 - despite the overall trend of declining physical game sales in favour of digital.

The Rplate can reportedly function in extreme temperatures, has some customization features, and is managed via Bluetooth using a smartphone app. Rplates are also equipped with an LTE antenna, which can be used to push updates, change the plate if the vehicle is reported stolen or lost, and notify vehicle owners if their car may have been stolen.
Perhaps most importantly to the average car owner, Reviver said Rplate owners can renew their registration online through the Reviver mobile app...</span>

                              <span>With Starfield&#x27;s hugely anticipated 2023 release growing ever-closer, Bethesda has launched a new Q&amp;A video series, and episode one sees director Todd Howard responding to a number of community queries - including sharing some thoughts on traits, dialogue, and whether Starfield can be described as a &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; game.


Howard began the chat by detailing a few of Starfield&#x27;s inspirations - 1984 space sim SunDog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller, if you&#x27;re wondering - before moving on to tackle the &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; question. This, he said, was a little tricky to answer insofar as different people will likely have different definitions of &quot;hard sci-fi&quot;, but for Bethesda, &quot;It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here&#x27;s how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that&quot;.


However, he also called the question a bit of a trap, &quot;because it&#x27;s a video game. Like, a hard science-fiction video game would be, you die in space cold.&quot;

                              <span>Valve has finally revamped its decidedly decrepit Steam mobile app for iOS and Android, introducing a fresh look, a new interface, and a range of new features.


The original version of Valve&#x27;s Steam mobile app launched over a decade ago, and it&#x27;s felt exceedingly outdated for a very long time. As of today, though, iOS and Android users can download a completely refreshed version via their device&#x27;s respective app stores.


It&#x27;s most immediately obvious change is a considerably more streamlined interface - which gives quick access to the store, personalised news, Steam Guard, and notifications, as well as unburying the likes of wish lists and other key features - but there&#x27;s plenty more besides.

                              <span>Torchlight: Infinite - a new free-to-play reimagining of the dungeon-crawling action-RPG series - has just launched its open beta on Android, iOS, and PC.


Torchlight, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was originally the work of now-defunct developer Runic Games, which made two games in the series before its closure in 2017 - the sequel delivering a critically acclaimed chunk of captivating dungeon-crawling and class-based hack-and-slash action. 


Having disbanded Runic, publisher Perfect World then revived the series just nine months later, handing the reins to developer Echtra Games for 2020&#x27;s Torchlight 3. Interestingly, this third outing was initially planned to be a free-to-play title before Perfect World eventually capitulated after a bit of an outcry - but now, following Torchlight 3&#x27;s less-than-stellar reception, those free-to-play plans are back for Torchlight: Infinite.

                              <span>FIFA has launched its first video game venture since its split with EA - a vaguely football-themed Roblox &quot;immersive experience&quot; intended to tie-in with this year&#x27;s Qatar world cup.


Following the termination of FIFA&#x27;s partnership with EA earlier this year - which will result in the latter&#x27;s long-running football series being rebranded as EA Sports FC from 2023 - FIFA president Gianni Infantino insisted, &quot;I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans.&quot;


To that end, it said it had already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024, but would first be launching a number of &quot;non-simulation games&quot; toward the end of this year.

The headline addition is Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the definitive edition version previously remastered for PS4 and PS5. 


But Dragon Quest fans will be happy with five games from the series added to PS Plus: Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age, Dragon Quest Builders and its sequel, Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree&#x27;s Woe and the Blight Below, and Dragon Quest Heroes 2: Explorer&#x27;s Edition.

&quot;Let&#x27;s try that again,&quot; Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra wrote on Twitter last night, sharing a fresh blog post from the developer which apologises - yet again - for the game&#x27;s troubled arrival and offers a few bits and pieces to cheer fans up.


Overwatch 2 players can look forward to &quot;several Double Match XP weekends&quot; - dates for which will be announced soon. Anyone who logs in this season from 25th October onwards will also get a Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary skin and a Health Pack Weapon Charm, which is nice I guess.

Custom boot videos for the Steam Deck have recently taken off, and Reddit user waylaidwanderer has even gone to the lengths of setting up the website SteamDeckRepo, dedicated to sharing videos for others to use.

Now it looks like Valve is jumping onto the trend, with references to &quot;Steam Deck Startup Movies&quot; found in code for the Points Shop.

                              <span>Researchers have used thermal cameras and ML guessing techniques to recover passwords from measuring the residual heat left by fingers on keyboards. From the abstract:
We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</span>

                              <span>Interesting research: “ImpNet: Imperceptible and blackbox-undetectable backdoors in compiled neural networks, by Tim Clifford, Ilia Shumailov, Yiren Zhao, Ross Anderson, and Robert Mullins:
Abstract: Early backdoor attacks against machine learning set off an arms race in attack and defence development. Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</span>

                              <span>This is a story of one piece of what is probably a complex employment scam. Basically, real programmers are having their resumes copied and co-opted by scammers, who apply for jobs (or, I suppose, get recruited from various job sites), then hire other people with Western looks and language skills are  to impersonate those first people on Zoom job interviews. Presumably, sometimes the scammers get hired and…I suppose…collect paychecks for a while until they get found out and fired. But that requires a bunch of banking fraud as well, so I don’t know...</span>

We expect the brand new Third Party Security Audit of Kubernetes will be
published later this month (Oct 2022).
In preparation for that, let&#x27;s look at the state of findings that were made
public as part of the last third party security audit of
2019
that was based on Kubernetes v1.13.4.
Motivation
Craig Ingram has graciously attempted over the years to keep track of the
status of the findings reported in the last audit in this issue:
kubernetes/kubernetes#81146.
This blog post will attempt to dive deeper into this, address any gaps
in tracking and become a point in time summary of the state of the
findings reported from 2019.

Whether on-premises or in the cloud, clusters face real constraints for resource usage, quota, and cost management reasons. Regardless of the autoscalling capabilities, clusters have finite capacity. As a result, users want an easy way to fairly and
efficiently share resources.
In this article, we introduce Kueue,
an open source job queueing controller designed to manage batch jobs as a single unit.
Kueue leaves pod-level orchestration to existing stable components of Kubernetes.
Kueue natively supports the Kubernetes Job
API and offers hooks for integrating other custom-built APIs for batch jobs.
Why Kueue?
Job queueing is a key feature to run batch workloads at scale in both on-premises and cloud environments. The main goal…</span>

Kubernetes v1.25 introduces the support for user namespaces.
This is a major improvement for running secure workloads in
Kubernetes. Each pod will have access only to a limited subset of the
available UIDs and GIDs on the system, thus adding a new security
layer to protect from other pods running on the same system.
How does it work?
A process running on Linux can use up to 4294967296 different UIDs and
GIDs.
User namespaces is a Linux feature that allows mapping a set of users
in the container to different users in the host, thus restricting what
IDs a process can effectively use.
Furthermore, the capabilities granted in a new user namespace do not
apply in the host initial namespaces.
Why is it important?
