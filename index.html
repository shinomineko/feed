                              <span>Lost Ark is getting into the spooky spirit with its new October update, Monster Bash.

Live now, the new Monster Bash update gives players &quot;scary new customisation options&quot; and the chance to dress up as witches and demons, as well as new weapons &quot;guaranteed to scare their enemies&quot;.

Perhaps best of all, however, you get to do all that with your own Little Ghost Pet.

                              <span>Sony may be soon implementing trophies for the PC versions of its games. 

That&#x27;s according to True Trophies, which asserts that its own scanners have picked up &quot;new evidence&quot; to suggest PS5 games available on PC may soon support PlayStation trophies, enabling PC players to pick up the bronze, silver, gold, and platinum awards regardless of what platform they use.

According to True Trophies&#x27; scanners, a new platform called &quot;PSPC&quot; recently popped up alongside a new trophy list simply entitled &quot;Trophy Set&quot;. Depending upon who you listen to, the &quot;PSPC&quot; could stand for &quot;PlayStation PC&quot; or &quot;PlayStation Studios PC&quot; – right now, we just don&#x27;t know.

                              <span>Blizzard has taken down a Diablo 4 video after fans pointed out several bizarre mistakes and inaccuracies within it.

&quot;Check out some of the best quality-of-life changes coming with Season of Blood,&quot; the Diablo account said on its Twitter/X account alongside a two-minute-long video that showcased some of those changes… so people did. And some, like streamer and YouTuber Taxxanterax, had a lot to say in response.

As spotted by PCGN, shortly after the video was posted, streamer and YouTuber Raxxanterax posted a video offering some &quot;constructive feedback&quot; after noting several mistakes, including inverted before/after map layouts, and a side-by-side comparison of what is described as &quot;improved&quot; horse speed that looks almost identical.

The PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and last-gen console versions – as well as boxed physical versions – will be available in the first few months (Q1) of 2024.

The announcement accompanies news that the series has secured a licensing deal with FIFPRO – not to be confused with football associations of similar names – that developer Tower Studios says makes Sociable Soccer 24 &quot;the only FIFPRO-licensed arcade action football game currently available on the market for PC and console&quot; and provides the game with over 10,000 licensed players from around the world.

According to commenters in the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, it seems as though the game is circulating illegally via ROM sites, with various comments and posts that seemingly shared links to the pirated software deleted from the thread.

&quot;Who tf cares about spoilers in a Mario game,&quot; posited one commenter. &quot;It&#x27;s not like the story is important lol.&quot;

                              <span>Diablo 4 is just days away from launching on Steam, and one obvious question that&#x27;s arisen following the news of its storfront jump - will it work on Steam Deck? - has finally be answered by Blizzard. And it&#x27;s good news, taking the form of a &#x27;Steam Deck Verified&#x27; yes.


I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve not actually played Diablo 4, but its predecessor was an absolute treat to have readily, portably to hand on Switch, so I can very much see why fans of Blizzard&#x27;s latest would be keen for news on its Steam Deck compatibility.


And, thankfully, Diablo&#x27;s global community development director Adam Fletcher had good news to share when he broached the topic in response to fan queries on social media. &quot;We can happily say,&quot; Fletcher wrote, &quot;that Diablo 4 will be Steam Deck Verified starting next Tuesday with the launch of the game on Steam and the start of Season of Blood!&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a Counter-Strike 2 player with an AMD GPU, pay attention: Valve has warned that the company&#x27;s latest GPU driver has introduced a new feature that, if activated, will result in a Steam VAC ban. So, basically, proceed with caution.


Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on; AMD&#x27;s newly released Adrenalin Edition 23.10.1 driver adds, among other things, Anti-Lag+ support for Counter-Strike 2, which, on the face of it, seems like an entirely positive thing. After all, who wouldn&#x27;t want less lag in their fiercely competitive online shooty game?


Unfortunately, the way the Anti-Lag+ feature works - it does its job by &quot;detouring engine dll functions&quot;, according to Valve - can have serious consequences for Counter-Strike 2 players who opt to turn it on.

                              <span>With Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition now officially a done deal as of today, Ubisoft has been discussing its new ownership of all Activision Blizzard streaming rights, which also kick in today - and as part of the conversation, it&#x27;s talked a little about physical media, saying that while interesting might decline as streaming rises, it doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &quot;going away&quot;.


Ubisoft secured the streaming rights to all Activision Blizzard games (for the next 15 years, and outside the EU, at least) as part of revisions made by Microsoft to get its proposed acquisition across the finish line after UK regulators blocked the deal highlighting concerns around its potential impact on the emerging cloud gaming market.


With the deal now approved and Microsoft officially the owner of Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft&#x27;s role as streaming rights licensor of Activision&#x27;s games has come into effect too. The Assassin&#x27;s Creed publisher has shared a Q&amp;A to mark the occasion, discussing its view on the future of game streaming and clarifying some aspects of its agreement with Microsoft - including reconfirmation Activision Blizzard games are coming to its own Ubisoft+ subscription service.

This is the first concrete detail we&#x27;ve heard about his new game at 22Cans since he teased it last year at a Gamelab conference, saying it has a mechanic which has &quot;never been seen in a game&quot; before.
Molyneux revealed the game is currently codenamed MOAT, an acronym, last month.

In a statement shared with Eurogamer, the CWA said today&#x27;s merger represents a &quot;milestone&quot; in the industry.


&quot;Under the terms of a ground-breaking, legally-binding labour neutrality agreement, Microsoft will remain neutral when Activision Blizzard employees express interest in joining a union, providing a clear path to collective bargaining for almost 10,000 workers,&quot; the CWA said, with its president Claude Cummings Jr calling this a &quot;new day&quot; for Activision Blizzard employees following mass employee protests in 2021.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard&#x27;s controversial boss Bobby Kotick has said he will stay on as the company&#x27;s CEO for the remainder of 2023, following Microsoft&#x27;s long-awaited acquisition of the company today. 


A statement from Xbox boss Phil Spencer says similar, with Kotick&#x27;s tenure at the company set to continue through &quot;the end of 2023&quot; to &quot;ensure a smooth and seamless integration&quot;. 


Neither notice makes it explicit what will happen next year, though the wording of both statements suggests Kotick&#x27;s departure is possible as early as January 2024.

                              <span>Microsoft has now formally acquired Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn - the biggest company buyout in video games industry history.


Today&#x27;s long-awaited deal closure finalises a process that has dragged on through almost two years of regulatory approvals and legal wrangling. Finally, however, it is done - hours after the UK ultimately gave the deal a green light.


Microsoft now owns Activision, including the world&#x27;s biggest first-person shooter franchise Call of Duty, alongside the rights to Spyro, Skylanders, and Guitar Hero.

                              <span>CD Projekt turned to AI technology to replicate a Cyberpunk 2077 Polish voice actor who passed away in 2021. 


The late Miłogost Reczek&#x27;s voice was reproduced by an AI algorithm for Phantom Liberty - the base game&#x27;s recent expansion - for its Polish-language release. 
In a statement shared with Bloomberg, CD Projekt said it had obtained permission from Reczek&#x27;s family to recreate the actor&#x27;s voice in this way for the expansion.

Producer Yoshimi Yasuda made the announcement earlier today on social media.
Last year, Yasuda stated Lollipop Chainsaw RePop won&#x27;t update the original&#x27;s story or aesthetics. &quot;We want to make it so that the game can be as close to the original version as possible,&quot; Yasuda said, echoing the only major aspect which will be changed is the game&#x27;s licensed music soundtrack.

&quot;I&#x27;m over it. I&#x27;m so over it,&quot; he says at the start of the video as he leaves the office. &quot;I am Hideki Kamiya, unemployed. Welcome to my channel.&quot;

The card was initially a free add-on for Pokémon Center customers, given out at a rate of one card for each item in the Van Gogh collection bought.
This time around, only orders with Pokémon Trading Card Game products will be eligible for a card. A minimum purchase of £30/$30 is required, and the giveaway is limited to one card per order.

The studio has also re-shared a guide it originally released last year, when Arma 3 footage was being used to create fake videos purporting to show the conflict in Ukraine.


&quot;With the tragic events currently unfolding in the Middle East, we feel it is vital to share once again our statement concerning the use of Arma 3 as a source of fake news footage,&quot; Bohemia wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

This &quot;Really Useful Starfield&quot; mod was created and uploaded by the aptly named Trainwiz, who has kindly provided us with a rather sinister backstory explaining Thomas&#x27; arrival in space.


&quot;For his crimes against God and his invention of murder, Thomas was smote, thusly. Rejected from Hell and obviously never going to get into Heaven, they say that the Tank Engine has been banished to wander the stars forever, unable to satiate his bloodlust and unable to find peace in his heart,&quot; Trainwiz begins.

The game has been available for press and content creators ahead of its release today, with frequent patches attempting to stabilise its performance.


The Xbox version was not made available for review and it appears the delay in this patch may be the reason.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has approved Microsoft&#x27;s revised deal to purchase Activision Blizzard.


This leaves the door open for Microsoft to finally complete its proposed $68.7bn acquisition of the Call of Duty and Overwatch maker, over a year and half since it was first announced.


In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), the CMA wrote: &quot;We&#x27;ve cleared the new deal for Microsoft to buy Activision without cloud gaming rights. In August, Microsoft made a concession that would see Ubisoft, instead of Microsoft, buy Activision&#x27;s cloud gaming rights.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been looking to stock up on the spooks and scares in anticipation of this year&#x27;s impending Halloween, the Epic Games Store has your back; next week&#x27;s freebie over there is The Evil Within, the acclaimed horror from Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami. And it&#x27;s joined by the Eurogamer recommended Eternal Threads.


The Evil Within - which was created by Ghostwire: Tokyo and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, the studio Mikami departed earlier this year - released all the way back in 2014, dragging players, in the role of rugged police detective Sebastian Castellanos, along on a positively bonkers ride through the shape-shifting likes of a dilapidated asylum, a fading mansion, a mannequin factory, and more.


It&#x27;s a return to the kind of nail-bitingly tense third-person survival horror Mikami&#x27;s Resident Evil games - particularly the revolutionary Resident Evil 4 - were known for, and it all plays out like an enthusiastic love letter to the horror genre as a whole, packing in everything from sadistic chainsaw-wielding cannibals to J-horror-style hair ghosts. It&#x27;s great, despite a few rough edges.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a dramatic day for internet-sleuthing Mario fans; with Nintendo still tightlipped on who&#x27;ll take over the role of the iconic plumber following Charles Martinet&#x27;s acension to &quot;Mario Ambassador&quot;, a fresh leak appeared to have finally revealed video gaming&#x27;s current biggest secret. However, the actor in question - one Mick Wingert - has now thrown a bit of a spanner in the works by declaring that, no, it&#x27;s not actually him.


To rewind a bit, all this started when (thanks VGC) an anonymous 4chan forum user shared images and details said to be from a US kiosk demo for Switch&#x27;s soon-to-be-released Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Some of those images revealed previously unseen areas of the game, suggesting the leak was, in fact, legit - suddenly making an accompanying 20-strong unverified list of Mario Wonder voice actors a lot more interesting.


Now relatively sure of the list&#x27;s veracity, internet sleuths began combing through the names - unhelpfully provided with no hint of the roles they&#x27;re playing in-game - trying to figure out if one them might just be the new voice of Mario. To cut a long story short, after removing returning Mario series voice actors, indentifiable foreign language actors, and female actors, only two names remained: Kevin Afghani and Mick Wingert.

                              <span>Alien: Blackout, the Amanda Ripley-starring survival horror that launched on mobile back in 2019, is being delisted from the iOS App Store and Google Play on 31st October.


Alien: Blackout follows Amanda Ripley (daughter of Ellen Ripley) as she attempts to guide four survivors to safety aboard the Xenomorph-infested Mendel Station, viewing their progress through security cameras and via an overhead station map.


It&#x27;s officially &quot;not related&quot; to Creative Assembly&#x27;s superb 2014 first-person horror Alien: Isolation, despite being set just a few days after the game and sharing a protagonist - although that bit of information wasn&#x27;t revealed until Blackout&#x27;s announcement began to draw ire from fans angry at what appeared to be a sequel releasing exclusively for mobile.

                              <span>EA has shared more details on EA Sports FC Tactical, its previously announced free-to-play turn-based football spin-off, confirming it&#x27;ll launch for iOS and Android &quot;early 2024&quot;.


EA Sports FC Tactical was first mentioned during EA&#x27;s grand unveiling for its new-look football series back in July. At the time, information on the game was limited, but the publisher has now shared a little more as pre-registration opens via the iOS App Store and Google Play.


EA says Tactical is all about &quot;in-game strategies, such as stamina and power-play management&quot;, and it reimagines EA Sports FC&#x27;s usual match action as a turn-based experience, with opponents taking it in turns to defend, attack, perform skill moves, and attempt to score goals.

                              <span>Interesting New York Times article about high-school students hacking the grading system.
What’s not helping? The policies many school districts are adopting that make it nearly impossible for low-performing students to fail—they have a grading floor under them, they know it, and that allows them to game the system.
Several teachers whom I spoke with or who responded to my questionnaire mentioned policies stating that students cannot get lower than a 50 percent on any assignment, even if the work was never done, in some cases. A teacher from Chapel Hill, N.C., who filled in the questionnaire’s “name” field with “No, no, no,” said the 50 percent floor and “NO attendance enforcement” leads to a scenario where “we get students who skip over 100 days, have a 50 percent, complete a couple of assignments to tip over into 59.5 percent and then pass.”...</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has unveiled a new Xbox Series S Starter Bundle, which&#x27;ll include three months of Game Pass Ultimate when it launches worldwide on 31st October.


All in all, it&#x27;s a pretty straightforward offering, packing in the Xbox Series S (which comes with 512GB storage as standard), a wireless controller, an HDMI cable, and the aforementioned three months of Game Pass Ultimate - all for £249.99.


It&#x27;s the latter that sets the Starter Bundle apart from Microsoft&#x27;s usual £250 Xbox Series S offering, of course, meaning you&#x27;re basically getting that three months of Game Pass Ultimate - which would ordinarily cost around £40 - as a freebie.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Sony&#x27;s newly-announced PlayStation 5 &quot;Slim&quot;, which is set to launch in the US next month. 
Repeatedly leaked, the PS5 Slim&#x27;s existence was not too much of a surprise, though word that its digital version would cost more in the US and that you now need to splash out £25 to stand the console upright still managed to raise some eyebrows. 
Rather than a proper mid-gen refresh, the Slim is more of a redesign - with no real incentive for existing PS5 owners to upgrade. Still, is a good resdesign? Does it position the console&#x27;s digital edition as the PS5&#x27;s main version? And most importantly, is standing your console vertical better? Joining me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

A &quot;small number&quot; of players were inadvertently banned due to their accounts being flagged as having tampered with game client functionality.


These players are now being given 5000 Silver to use in the game, worth around £40.

The CBT (rest in piece CNT) will take place next weekend from 20th to 23rd October. Those with access will be able to try out head-to-head competitive play with cross-platform matching, and the Tekken Fight Lounge, described as an &quot;immersive lobby&quot; where players can interact and explore different features and game modes. 
Footage from the beta can easily be found on social media sites, as well as bewilderment from fans. Bandai Namco rolled out a pre-load update for the beta on Steam and Xbox on 10th, giving those with the know-how the opportunity to crack the PC files.

                              <span>Valve is introducing SMS verification for developers as part of its new security measures on Steamworks. This follows earlier incidents of hackers taking over several developers&#x27; accounts on the platform, where they added malware to various game builds.


These attacks, which were verified by PC Gamer, only affected less than 100 Steam users, although NanoWar: Cells VS Virus (pictured above) developer Benoît Freslon recently revealed the hackers had taken control of his browser access tokens. This essentially gave the hackers access to any service Freslon had been logged into. 
&quot;I just used my dev account to release the game few hours before the hack I suppose,&quot; he shared on X (formerly Twitter).

The latest in the fighting series was released last month across PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo&#x27;s console. However, the Switch version was plagued with numerous issues and vastly inferior visuals.



This new update includes visual improvements and bug fixes, performance improvements, and stability fixes, according to the patch notes.

                              <span>I always find it difficult to pick out which demos are worth my limited time whenever Steam Next Fest rolls around again. The process is made a lot easier when I find something which promises the zen-like quality of PowerWash Simulator.
It may not seem like it at first, but somehow Crime Scene Cleaner manages to deliver on that promise. Despite the lack of cats and the abundance of dead bodies and blood.
You take on the role of a single dad who&#x27;s a school caretaker (or janitor, seeing as the game takes place in the US) by day, and a mob cleanup crew by night. The mob pays much better than the regular day job, and we need the money to pay for our sick daughter&#x27;s healthcare. Ah, the good old American healthcare system.

                              <span>Pokémon Go looks set to introduce the ability to party up, and explore alongside friends in-game. 


A teaser image posted on social media shows the silhouettes of four in-game avatars standing next to a gym with a raid egg, suggesting that four-player teams will be able to travel together and head as one into the game&#x27;s PVE battles.


Pokémon Go developer Niantic captioned the image with a teasing eye emoji, an emoji wearing a party hat, and the hashtag #GoStartTheParty.

                              <span>Ubisoft seems happy with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, which it says has similar play numbers at launch as recent games such as Origins and Odyssey.


This is positive, as both Origins and Odyssey were far bigger and costlier projects, whereas Mirage is - by design - more focused.


2020&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla remains the biggest Assassin&#x27;s Creed launch in the series to date.

The Fungle, as it is known, will be available across all platforms as part of a free update. It promises players the chance to immerse their Impostors and Crewmates in a &quot;weird mushroom jungle&quot;. Are InnerSloth putting the fun in fungal? Well, we don&#x27;t have long until we can find out, as this map launches in just a couple of weeks time, on 24th October. 


You can see a little teaser for what mushroom-filled chaos is in store via the video below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s looking increasingly likely Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard will have cleared its final hurdle if - as is widely expected - UK regulators approve the revised deal later this week; it&#x27;s being reported EU regulators won&#x27;t require an investigation into the revised terms, clearing the way for the acquisition to conclude.


The European Commission approved Microsoft&#x27;s original acquisition proposal back in May after successfully securing a number of concessions to lessen the deal&#x27;s potential impact on the emerging cloud gaming market. However, Microsoft was forced to submit a revised proposal after the deal was blocked by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority.


These revised terms - which will give Ubisoft exclusive control of streaming rights for Activision&#x27;s titles outside of the EU - were provisionally approved by the CMA in September, and the regulator is expected to formally approve the deal this Friday, 13th October.

                              <span>Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery - which bundles together all three entries in developer Worm Club&#x27;s endearingly silly sleuthing series - will be launching for PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox (including Game Pass) on 27th October.


Fire up Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery, and you&#x27;ll be able to play The Haunted Island - the 2018 adventure that started it all, wherein our sleuthing lead travels to exotic climes to solve the mystery of a sloth-bothering ghost - alongside its fairly self-explanatory 2019 sequel, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, and Frog Detective&#x27;s final case, the wild-west-themed Corruption at Cowboy County, which released earlier this year.


These are not particularly lengthy games, each lasting an hour or two (Worm Club&#x27;s official estimate for the whole Entire Mystery is &quot;the four best hours of your life&quot;), but Frog Detective&#x27;s warm, silly demeanour still makes for a wonderfully entertaining time. And there&#x27;s even a scooter in part three so, really, what&#x27;s not to like?

                              <span>This is a fun challenge:
The NIST elliptic curves that power much of modern cryptography were generated in the late ’90s by hashing seeds provided by the NSA. How were the seeds generated? Rumor has it that they are in turn hashes of English sentences, but the person who picked them, Dr. Jerry Solinas, passed away in early 2023 leaving behind a cryptographic mystery, some conspiracy theories, and an historical password cracking challenge.

So there’s a $12K prize to recover the hash seeds.
Some backstory:
Some of the backstory here (it’s the funniest fucking backstory ever): it’s lately been circulating—though I think this may have been somewhat common knowledge among practitioners, though definitely not to me—that the “random” seeds for the NIST P-curves, generated in the 1990s by Jerry Solinas at NSA, were simply SHA1 hashes of some variation of the string “Give Jerry a raise”...</span>

Ever wonder how software gets deployed onto a system that is deliberately disconnected from the Internet and other networks? These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature. Sensitive as in utilities (power/water), banking, healthcare, weapons systems, other government use cases, etc. Sometimes it&#x27;s technically a water gap, if you&#x27;re running Kubernetes on an underwater vessel. Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.
Again, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments. Traditionally, software artifacts are physically carried across the air gap on hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, or flo…</span>

Last week, YouTuber Volound issued a well-sourced report on Hyenas&#x27; downfall, including the detail that it had been Sega&#x27;s &quot;biggest budget game ever&quot;. That report stated Hyenas had been plagued with a lack of direction before it was ultimately canned.
Now, a further video by Volound has shared further quotes on Hyenas from anonymous sources who worked on its development. &quot;I&#x27;m paralysed with a mixture of upset and anger over what&#x27;s happening to my friends there,&quot; one person said.

Cloud streaming has been included with PlayStation Plus Premium membership since Sony&#x27;s revised subscription service launched last year. However, it was previously restricted to streaming PS4 Game Catalogue titles and PS3 and PS2 games from the Classics Catalogue.


Starting this month, though, Premium subscribers can play PlayStation 5 Game Catalogue titles, PlayStation 5 Game Trials, and digital PlayStation 5 titles they&#x27;ve purchased (including associated DLC and in-game purchases) via cloud streaming on their PS5.

                              <span>Team17 is poised to lay off up to 91 people - a third of the company - as part of its major restructuring programme, Eurogamer can reveal. 


The publisher of Worms, Dredge and Hell Let Loose confirmed it was planning to make redundancies earlier this month, after Eurogamer broke news that extensive cuts were being made to Team17&#x27;s QA department in favour of outsourcing work elsewhere.


But the job losses go much further than those at risk in QA, Eurogamer understands, with staff across a wide range of departments affected - including those employed in Team17&#x27;s marketing, usability, customer service, IT and HR teams.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has called its recent The Lamplighters League a &quot;big disappointment&quot; from a commercial perspective, admitting - just seven days after its release - the pulp strategy game is unlikely to recoup its development costs, resulting in a $22.7m USD write-down.


The Lamplighters League, which was developed by the Paradox-owned Harebrained Schemes, blends tactical turn-based action and real-time stealth in a globe-trotting adventure inspired by the classic pulp stories of the 1930s, giving players control of a disparate group of rogues as they attempt to thwart an occult-obsessed cabal known as the Banished Court.


In truth, it&#x27;s a deeply uneven experience; at its best, it&#x27;s a &quot;sublimely atmospheric, richly rewarding tactical adventure&quot; - as I wrote in my 3 out of 5 stars review - but it&#x27;s too often let down by bland maps, uninspiring mission objectives, and woefully underdeveloped real-time stealth. And it&#x27;s clearly failed to capture the public&#x27;s imagination too.

                              <span>Nintendo has shared a new promo for upcoming release Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and it is really quite charming. 


The short video in question shows Bowser trying his best to woo Princess Peach with a single flower. She looks at him with a certain amount of scepticism, before both are distracted by the bouncy arrival of one of Super Mario Bros. Wonder&#x27;s elephant power-ups. And, well, when one sees the opportunity to boost one&#x27;s form into that of a trunk swinging, water spraying mammal, there really is only one thing for it. 


Soon, Peach has ingested (?) the elephantine delectable and is transformed before Bowser&#x27;s very eyes. He is shocked to say the least, staring at his once demure princess with an open mouth and wide eyes. But, you know what? Our spikey boy is into it. Just when it may seem that Peach - in her enlarged and now tailed form - is about to blast Bowser back to his castle with a swift burst of water, he presents her with an even bigger bunch of flowers. It is a plot twist I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and it is really rather sweet.

In December 2021, Snail Games successfully requested a DMCA takedown of Myth of Empires from Steam, alleging copyright infringement. Shortly after, Angela Game filed a lawsuit requesting a jury trial and sued Snail Games for damages.  
The two companies, as well as Ark publisher Studio Wildcard, have come to a settlement agreement and will work together on the redistribution of Myth of Empires, as spotted by GamesIndustry.biz. Angela Game will pay royalty payments from the game to Snail Games.

                              <span>Lilith Moira, Diablo&#x27;s demonic Queen of the Succubi, is now in Overwatch 2, but this has been even less of a heavenly debut than perhaps developer Blizzard was expecting. 


The studio made a big deal out of Lilith&#x27;s arrival as part of its promos for Season 7: Rise of Darkness. This got fans excited - or it did, until it didn&#x27;t.


You see, it turns out this Lilith skin is only available through an Ultimate Battle Pass bundle, and that bundle doesn&#x27;t exactly come cheap - it&#x27;s £35/$40.

                              <span>Fortnite will drop players back into the game&#x27;s basic but beloved original map - or at least parts of it.


That&#x27;s according to a wave of reports from trusted leakers such as HypeX and Shiina, who rely on insider information and details gleaned from within Fortnite&#x27;s files. 


Yesterday, Fortnite imagery appeared online that referenced a return to the original &quot;Chapter 1&quot; map, as this season&#x27;s villain Kado Thorne can be seen standing in front of a time machine set to the date &quot;2018 07 12&quot; - that&#x27;s the day the original map&#x27;s fifth season launched.

                              <span>Yesterday, Sony announced its &quot;slim&quot; models for the regular and digital editions of PlayStation 5, but not without some extra costs being introduced with the line.
For starters, both the regular and digital PS5 slim models will come with a hotizontal stand, but no base. A base is included in the box with the launch models, but if you want to stand the PS5 slim vertically, you&#x27;ll need to buy a separate vertical stand (compatible with all PS5 models!) for £25, or $30. 
For buyers in North America, the slim model of the digital PS5 is more expensive than the launch model, costing $450 compared to $400, despite its smaller size. The slim PS5 with a disc drive will remain at the same price of $500.

                              <span>Earlier this week, British eSports announced a partnership with the Saudi eSports Federation. The UK&#x27;s national body for competitive video gaming said this collaboration aimed to set &quot;new standards of excellence, education and innovation throughout the world of esports&quot;. This would include a variety of endeavours between the two parties, including internships, training programs and research projects.


However, British eSports has now acknowledged this news had sparked &quot;concern&quot; - no doubt fuelled by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s poor human rights record, which includes the criminalisation of homosexuality, fewer rights for women and the use of the death penalty. Saudi&#x27;s Prince Mohammed bin Salman has also been blamed for assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by US intelligence agencies.


As a result, British eSports has released a statement addressing issues raised by the esports community.

The video, which was published by 404media following public records requests, shows the car being driven erratically as the officers race to catch a Snorlax and then a Togetic - the evolved form of Togepi.


The two cops talk excitedly about catching Pokémon while, in the background, radio calls can be heard - including a request for backup at a local shopping mall where a robbery is in progress.

                              <span>Disney&#x27;s CEO Bob Iger is reportedly being pushed to acquire a major video game publisher, such as EA. 


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg (paywall), which stated Iger&#x27;s deputies are keen for the exec &quot;to consider a bolder transformation of Disney from gaming licensee to gaming giant&quot;. This could be done through the acquisition of a major publisher, with EA being specifically cited by the publication.


But while Iger&#x27;s advisors are suggesting that Disney do purchase a company such as EA, at the present time Iger is reportedly remaining &quot;non committal&quot; to the idea. So, do not expect to hear any big announcements in the near future.

The internal event, held days before Microsoft is expected to finally close its $68.7bn takeover of the company, was not available to view publicly, but Windows Central has  reported on what was discussed.


Kotick reportedly reminisced about Activision&#x27;s journey as a company so far and also dropped several hints about its future - including an intriguing mention of the long-dormant Guitar Hero franchise.

                              <span>A new update for Diablo 4 - released on 17th October alongside Season of Blood - will bring a major change to the way damage is calculated.


Previously, Critical Strike Damage and Vulnerable Damage were calculated separately, meaning players could use skills with these attributes to pile on huge amounts of damage. 


Now, Critical Strike Damage will be capped at 50 percent and Vulnerable Damage at 20 percent as part of a &quot;baseline multiplicative bonus&quot; - bonus damage will be added together and multiplied by these percentages for each.

                              <span>Stardew Valley is bringing its first concert tour to London in April next year.
Festival of Seasons will begin in February 2024, touring North America and Australia before it reaches London. The programme has been curated by Stardew Valley creator (and composer) Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone, and will showcase music from the game performed by local chamber orchestras.
The show will be divided into four sections, to represent the four seasons, and fans can expect to hear tracks such as Stardew Valley Overture, Spring (The Valley Comes Alive) and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies, as well as &quot;plenty of surprises and fan-favourite deep cuts&quot;.

                              <span>Minecraft players have launched a petition demanding developer Mojang ends its annual mob vote - in which the community gets to vote on a new creature to be added to the game - saying the process &#x27;leaves fantastic ideas on the cutting room floor&#x27; and only serves to highlight Minecraft&#x27;s anaemic content release cycle.


Mojang has now revealed all three mobs that&#x27;ll be put to the vote ahead of a grand results unveiling during this weekend&#x27;s Minecraft Live - the crab, the penguin, and the armadillo - and it&#x27;s a selection a newly launched fan petition describes as &quot;three equally great options&quot;.


The petition, which at the time of writing has received 295K signatures from Minecraft fans in the three days since its launch, argues, &quot;Mojang somehow releases less content WITH Microsoft&#x27;s backing than they did without, [meaning] players see minimal content to the game they love&quot;. It continues that by &quot;leaving fantastic ideas on the cutting room floor, and teasing content that will never be seen in the game&quot;, players must &quot;watch as possibly the one thing to get them to play again is ripped from them&quot;.

                              <span>Rocket League developer Psyonix has announced the game will no longer support player-to-player trading as of 5th December this year, as the studio moves to &quot;align with Epic&#x27;s overall approach to game cosmetics and item shop policies&quot;.


Trading was introduced to Rocket League in 2016, giving players the opportunity to exchange certain earned items, including cosmetics dropped at the end of matches and revealed blueprints (but not premium DLC), with other players and third-party trading sites.


From 4pm PST on 5th December this year, however, player-to-player trading will be removed from the game. Explaining the change in a post to its website, Psyonix - which was acquired by Epic Games in 2019 - insisted this would align Rocket League with Epic&#x27;s &quot;overall approach to game cosmetics and item shop policies, where items aren&#x27;t tradable, transferrable, or sellable.&quot;

                              <span>Four years after its debut, developer Teyon&#x27;s Terminator: Resistance is set to receive a Complete Edition on Xbox Series X/S - bundling together the base game and Annihilation Line DLC (which was previously unavailable on the console) for release on 27th October this year.


Terminator: Resistance originally released back in 2019, whisking players away to a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles - some 31 years after the events of Terminator: Judgment Day - for some first-person shooting action as they, in the role of resistance fighter Jacob Rivers, helped mount an assault against the Terminator menace.


Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn&#x27;t too keen on the game when he reviewed it back in 2019, calling it &quot;so generic that it has dissolved in my memory like a Skip on my tongue&quot; - and that&#x27;s despite Terminator: Resistance somehow managing to shoe-horn in two &quot;inexplicably cringe&quot; first-person sex scenes along the way.

                              <span>Classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series Commandos is being revived for a sixth entry, Commandos: Origins, and it&#x27;s coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.


Commandos, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, first made a splash back in 1998 with launch of developer Pyro Studios&#x27; first series entry, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - which challenged players to guide a six-strong team of commandos, each with their own distinct abilities, behind enemy lines (the clue was very much in the title), to undertake the likes of sabotage and assassination missions while staying as sneaky as possible.


It&#x27;s very good, if notoriously tough, and was followed by four more games: 1999&#x27;s standalone expansion Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty, 2001&#x27;s Commandos 2: Men of Courage (which introduced a 3D engine), 2003&#x27;s Commandos 3: Destination Berlin, and 2006&#x27;s Commandos: Strike Force - which re-imagined the series&#x27; formula in first-person.

                              <span>There’s a new Cisco vulnerability in its Emergency Responder product:
This vulnerability is due to the presence of static user credentials for the root account that are typically reserved for use during development. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user.

This is not the first time Cisco products have had hard-coded passwords made public. You’d think it would learn...</span>

                              <span>Sony has unveiled new &quot;smaller&quot; versions of its PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Digital consoles, which will launch this November in the US alongside an optional disc drive attachment for purchasers that wish to upgrade their digital-only machine at a later date.


The newly revealed console is said to mark a 30% decrease in volume compared to the previous PS5 model (and a weight reduction of 18% and 24% for the standard and digital edition respectively), and sports a design featuring two glossy panels on the top and two bottom panels that&#x27;ll retain the matte look of the original machine.


The bottom left quadrant is where you&#x27;ll find the new Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive attachment if you opt for the standard version of the machine. The digital-only version includes a removable panel that&#x27;ll enable purchasers to add the drive - which costs an extra £99.99/€119.99/$79.99 USD - should they want a version capable of playing digital media at a later time.

Earlier today, Bandai Namco announced Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam). 
This revamped edition of the game will offer the same chaotic, chomp-tastic, 64-player shenanigans as its former Stadia exclusive days, but with the addition of new gameplay modes, music, customisation options and &quot;enhanced visuals&quot;.

The sets range from a small scene depicting a birthday party for villager Julian, made up of 170 pieces to a slightly larger 535-piece recreation of Nook&#x27;s Cranny and Rosie&#x27;s house. 
Other sets that will be available are Bunnie&#x27;s Outdoor Activities, Kapp&#x27;n&#x27;s Island Boat Tour, and Isabelle&#x27;s House Visit.

And sadly for those eager to hear more, this is seemingly not something we should expect to hear any time in the near future. Instead, Meta is remaining remarkably tight-lipped about the project it once said was &quot;many years in the making&quot;.
At this year&#x27;s Connect conference, Meta was asked for more news on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&#x27; VR release by both UploadVR and Road to VR. However, the responses were less than informative.

In summer 2020, allegations of sexual assault and harassment were made against a number of senior and veteran employees including Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla creative director Ashraf Ismail, Splinter Cell and Far Cry creative director Maxime Béland, and former editorial vice president Tommy François.
Speaking at GamesIndustry HR Summit last month, Ubisoft&#x27;s chief people officer Annika Grant said the company is now &quot;on the right path&quot; following a number of changes implemented internally, as reported by GamesIndustry. Grant joined Ubisoft in 2021 when it was &quot;navigating a misconduct crisis&quot;.

                              <span>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom takes us back to the same Hyrule we were first introduced to in Breath of the Wild, albeit with a few tweaks - not least its airy sky islands and dark and sinister Depths. 


But while those inclusions expanded the map, there were some omissions as well. Most obviously, just where did all of that Sheikah tech, that was so instrumental to Breath of the Wild&#x27;s story, go? And what happened to those spidery robot Guardians?


Well, according to Zelda director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, the various towers, Guardians, Divine Beasts and other Sheikah creations simply disappeared, with the general consensus in Hyrule being that as their purpose had been realised, the tech knew it was its time to go.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s annual Halloween extravaganza is back for another year, and this time the battle royale has roped in a few more famous friends.


Remedy&#x27;s very own Alan Wake will be available to buy as a skin later in the event, presumably timed alongside the launch of the long-awaited Alan Wake 2 (that&#x27;s due on 27th October). 


Jack Skellington from Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas is also joining Fortnite - I like that he also has his Santa Jack costume as well - alongside Halloween&#x27;s Michael Myers.

The &quot;inconsistencies&quot; surfaced during the game&#x27;s Public Test Session, designed to test the public servers, which happened on 28th September.
&quot;We&#x27;ve made the hard decision to delay the Preseason of XDefiant,&quot; Ubisoft said in a statement, in order to address the issues found.

                              <span>With all signs pointing to an imminent successful end for Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard acquisition saga, Activision has moved to address the issue of its titles appearing on Game Pass, saying not to expect that to happen until next year if the deal goes through.


To date, Activision titles have been notably absent from Game Pass, but the assumption has been that would change if Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn bid for the Call of Duty publisher succeeded. And with the deal now anticipated to be finalised this week, assuming the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority gives it the green light as is generally expected, questions around an Activision presence on Game Pass have shifted from &#x27;if&#x27; to &#x27;when&#x27;.


And the company has now addressed fan queries on social media, writing, &quot;As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we&#x27;ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.&quot;

                              <span>Unity has announced the departure of its CEO John Riccitiello, just weeks after the company became mired in controversy following hugely unpopular changes to its engine pricing model.


At the end of last month, Unity announced sweeping changes to its Unity Engine business model that would force developers to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee every time their game was installed, on top of their existing licence subscription, after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash from the development community was immediate and intense, and Unity eventually announced significant changes to its initial plans - but by that point, the damage was done.


And now Unity has announced that John Riccitiello, the CEO who oversaw its reputationally devastating pricing changes, &quot;will retire&quot; from all his roles at the company - president, chief executive officer, chairman, and a member of its board of directors - effective immediately.

                              <span>Steam&#x27;s Next Fest has returned for another week-long showcase of future releases, including developer livestreams, chats, and, of course, &quot;hundreds&quot; of playable demos.


Valve&#x27;s latest Steam Next Fest is already underway and runs until 5.59pm BST/9.59am PST on Monday, 16th October. That means you&#x27;ve got just under seven full days at the time of writing to furiously claw your way through another bumper crop of playable demos before they potentially vanish once more into the ether.


We&#x27;re well beyond the days when you could feasibly work your way through the entire list before the end of Next Fest (unless you&#x27;re particularly determined and hate sleep, I suppose), but Valve has, at least, assembled a special event mini-site, splitting available demos down into mere easily perusable and digestible categories.

FOV (that&#x27;s field-of-view if your abbreviation list isn&#x27;t up to date) can now be adjusted in both first- and third-person perspective with the arrival of Starfield&#x27;s 1.7.36 update, and that comes alongside a whopping three additional bullet points in Bethesda&#x27;s patch notes.


The studio is also touting improved stability for PCs using Intel Arc GPUs, and there are some - entirely mysterious - stability and performance improvements promised for all platforms.

                              <span>EA&#x27;s long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher&#x27;s keen to let everyone know it&#x27;s doing just fine without it - and has announced that this year&#x27;s iteration, EA Sports FC 24, has reached 11.3m players in its first week of release.


That&#x27;s compared to the 10.3m players that hopped into last year&#x27;s FIFA 23 during the same period - a figure EA referred to as &quot;record-breaking&quot; and the &quot;biggest launch period&quot; in the franchise&#x27;s history at the time.


EA Sports FC 24&#x27;s 11.3m players would certainly suggest the series&#x27; success hasn&#x27;t been hampered by the loss of the FIFA brand, then, but EA does note this year&#x27;s figures include EA Play subscribers, so those numbers don&#x27;t necessarily all equate to sales.

Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models
Abstract: Billions of dollars and countless GPU hours are currently spent on training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for a variety of tasks. Thus, it is essential to determine the difficulty of extracting all the parameters of such neural networks when given access to their black-box implementations. Many versions of this problem have been studied over the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural networks was presented at Crypto’20 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov. It resembles a differential chosen plaintext attack on a cryptosystem, which has a secret key embedded in its black-box implementation and requires a polynomial number of queries but an exponential amount of time (as a function of the number of neurons)...</span>

The Kubernetes community recently announced
that their legacy package repositories are frozen, and now they moved to
introduced community-owned package repositories powered by the
OpenBuildService (OBS).
CRI-O has a long history of utilizing
OBS for their package builds,
but all of the packaging efforts have been done manually so far.
The CRI-O community absolutely loves Kubernetes, which means that they&#x27;re
delighted to announce that:
All future CRI-O packages will be shipped as part of the officially supported
Kubernetes infrastructure hosted on pkgs.k8s.io!
There will be a deprecation phase for the existing packages, which is currently
being discussed in the CRI-O community.
The new infrastructure will only support releases of CRI-O &gt;&#x3D; v1.28.2 as well as

It&#x27;s called Assassin&#x27;s Focus, and it allows you to freeze time and paint a reticule over multiple enemies to teleport between them all and murder them in quick succession. It&#x27;s like Red Dead Redemption&#x27;s Quickdraw mode, except you&#x27;re physically knifing people in the neck with every bullet.


At the beginning of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, you can only pull off this effect with two enemies at a time, but with further upgrades you&#x27;re able to expand this effect to quickly end a whole group of foes at once.

Hero Pass was described by Jagex as an &quot;always-on reward system&quot; and it was introduced into RuneScape last month. It was heavily criticised by players for pay-to-win elements such as XP buffs, which prompted Jagex to temporarily roll back the update shortly after Hero Pass launched.
Following feedback from a player survey, Jagex announced Hero Pass will end once the current season, Underworld, finishes on 4th December.

Gollum released in a rather sorry state in May earlier this year, and was heavily criticised for a lack of polish and technical issues. A statement attributed to Daedalic Entertainment and released on its social media one day after release apologised for the game&#x27;s quality and stated the studio&#x27;s commitment to improving the game with patches.
The report from German outlet Game Two was created after interviewing 32 former and current employees at Daedalic, as well as receiving statements from the company itself, on the development of Gollum.

The full list will reportedly be made official this Wednesday, 11th October. The games will then be made available from 17th October.

                              <span>A skilled Tomb Raider fan has reimagined the series&#x27; second game as a 3D side-scroller.


Created by Delca, who is also working on a Tomb Raider Legend demake, this side-scrolling adventure sees Lara making her way around the likes of Venice, the Great Wall of China and, of course, Croft Manor as she searches for the Dagger of Xian. However, this time she can only travel backwards and forwards.


It is a rather incredible recreation, and one that clearly has a lot of love attached to it. As I said in my headline, it is a brilliant tribute to a brilliant game.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage might take Ubisoft&#x27;s historical stabathon series back to basics, but there&#x27;s a newer visual effect which players want rid of. 


The game&#x27;s visual chromatic aberration effect is switched on by default and there&#x27;s no way to turn it off - despite it being pronounced and sometimes quite distracting in certain areas. 


One of the first things I did when starting to play Mirage was look for some kind of slider or toggle to tune the effect (or just disable it completely). Alas, one does not exist.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been playing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, you&#x27;re likely to have missed out on a companion or two - as making certain decisions can affect who&#x27;s available. Heavy spoilers for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 are included in this article.
One of the most missable companions is Minthara, who appears in Act 1 of the game. In normal circumstances, recruiting her means siding with the goblins and attacking Emerald Grove along with the refugee Tieflings that are staying there.
However, this comes with some significant consequences - Halsin will refuse to help you later on in the game, and Karlach will be unavailable as a companion. Unless you&#x27;re Taiwanese player pao870111, who came up with a way to recruit Minthara in a morally good playthrough without the use of mods.

                              <span>A bakery in the States has used its artisanal skills to create a The Last of Us Clicker out of bread. 


Known as The Last of Crust, this sculpture by One House Bakery was cooked up by mother daughter duo Catherine and Hannalee Pervan as part of the Downtown Benicia Main Street&#x27;s annual Scarecrow Contest.
As reported by Eater San Francisco (via IGN), this event has also seen the skilled twosome come up with a range of Star Wars-themed crusty creations, with Pan Solo, Pain-dough-lorian, Baby Dough-da, and the Pandroid all gracing the competition in previous years.

                              <span>No, it&#x27;s not your imagination - yes, there is a cat in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage that has a very deliberate Assassin&#x27;s Emblem on his snout.

Even more amazingly still, the cat isn&#x27;t even a work of fiction created by the dev team. It turns out that a fan shared an image of the sweet kitty after he &quot;recently crossed the rainbow bridge&quot; and after bringing him to the attention of the team and offering &quot;coffee and Timbits&quot; to any dev prepared to immortalise the cat in the game, it seems Ubisoft did precisely that.

&quot;Am I reaching at straws here or?&quot; asked suckashelfboi101 on the game&#x27;s subreddit, seeking assurances that they weren&#x27;t just seeing things. &quot;Is this cats face supposed to look like the Assassin Emblem or what because it’s all I can see. Maybe something the devs put in for fun?&quot;

&quot;For the Season 22 mid-Season update, we wanted to adjust two Exotic armours that we felt were becoming hard to counter in PvP,&quot; the team explained in its weekly update, This Week at Bungie.

The promotion – headed by footballers Vini Jr, Leah Williamson, and ambassador Son Heung-min – lets players in &quot;20 markets around the world&quot; pick up special Pepsi cans and bottles containing codes that can be redeemed within the game.

Pepsi says the in-game items include &quot;slick vanity rewards&quot; such as kits, stadium designs, and TIFOs – the term given to choreographed visual displays by supporters – as well as one Ultimate Team 75+ rated untradeable gold item, &quot;enabling players to build formidable player line-ups within the new game&quot;.

The &quot;vast and nervous roguelike&quot; has been available on Steam since early 2022, and currently boasts a respectable &quot;very positive&quot; aggregate from user scores, but this marks the game&#x27;s first appearance on consoles courtesy of publisher Microids.

                              <span>The Talos Principle 2 is inviting you to try before you buy courtesy of a new Steam Next Fest demo.

Described as a &quot;standalone&quot; demo, players can get an early &quot;bespoke&quot; taste of the sequel&#x27;s &quot;bold new world&quot; through a series of hand-picked puzzles spread across &quot;stunning new locations, as well as a glimpse into the vast narrative that awaits them&quot;.

As Matt recently summarised for us, the original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving with lasers, time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle &quot;rooms&quot; that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress through the game.

From game collectible company Numskull, Coin-Ops to Table-Tops: The Essential Electronic Games boasts around 200 pages and will pair bespoke photography with a detailed rundown of some of gaming&#x27;s most enduring electronic tabletop games. It also aims to &quot;preserve not just the games, but the very essence of a past generation&#x27;s exuberance, reminding us that pixels and memories are forever intertwined&quot;.

&quot;We will embark on a journey to resurrect the history of nostalgic electronic tabletops,&quot; Numskull explains. &quot;Through a compelling narrative, we&#x27;ll unravel their profound impact over gaming history.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has filed a new US trademark for the name &quot;Sparking! Zero&quot;.

A Japanese lawyer representing Bandai Namco filed the trademark application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office on 26th September. 

Whilst it may not sound like much, this is pretty much the only Dragon Ball Z-flavoured news we&#x27;ve had since the new Budokai Tenkaichi instalment – which is called Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! series in Japan – was announced back in March.

Whilst we often get these hints from unlocked LinkedIn pages or dataminers, this time, it is the developer/publisher itself, Neowiz, that let slip courtesy of its recruitment site.

As spotted by Okami13, Neowiz&#x27;s site gives a little overview of its latest title, Lies of P, where it proudly displays that it was the most wanted game on PlayStation.

                              <span>Staff at CD Projekt Red are uniting with others in the Polish video game industry to unionise. 

The union was formed after CDPR announced a third wave of job cuts in as many months, driving developers to unionise as a means of &quot;improving their workplace/industry standards in a way that has legal power and amplifies their voices&quot;.

&quot;We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when nine per cent of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go,&quot; the union explains on the Gamedevunion.pl website (as translated by Google Translate).

                              <span>As we creak ever closer to spooky season and a possible second Silent Hill Transmission – the last was just before Halloween 2022 – it seems Bloober Team has quietly been updating the backend of Silent Hill 2 Remake&#x27;s Steam page.

In fairness, the store description and its accompanying tags have been tweaked routinely throughout the year, but according to Steam DB, there&#x27;s been a flurry of activity through September and now October, including confirmation of language subtitles (Brazillian, Portuguese, and Ukrainian), tags, and Steam achievements, hinting that the in-game achievements have been finalised and signed off. The store assets and images have also been refreshed, too.

Concrete proof that an update or release is imminent? Hardly. But it&#x27;s one of the strongest signals yet that development has entered the final straight, and the &quot;coming soon&quot; on the game&#x27;s Steam page is accurate. Here&#x27;s hoping we&#x27;ll get a long-overdue update from Konami in the next week or so.

That&#x27;s according to director Samuel Deats and the official Castlevania Twitter account, which not only confirmed the news yesterday but also shared a brief teaser, too. 

You can check it out the trailer below, which Deats says contains the &quot;actual storyboards, layouts, and animation&quot; coming to season 2:

                              <span>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile has been delayed to 2024.

Confirmation came in the action-packed Call of Duty Next event earlier this week, when co-studio head Chris Plummer said the delay was down to the team wanting to &quot;polish up&quot; the mobile spin-off. 

This means that the original &quot;fall (Q3) 2023&quot; window has now been pushed back to spring (Q2) 2024.

Hints that an expanded version of The Last of Us Part 2 is in development at Naughty Dog first surfaced back in July, when the game&#x27;s composer, Gustavo Santaolalla, referenced a &quot;new edition&quot; that would enable players to interact with his banjo-playing cameo in the town of Jackson, selecting from a number of songs he can play.


Santaolalla wouldn&#x27;t share any more details beyond that, leaving fans to ponder exactly what sort of &quot;new version&quot; he might be referring to, but now, thanks to a now-removed update on the LinkedIn profile of Naughty Dog&#x27;s lead outsource artist Mark Pajarillo (as spotted by over on Resetera), we might finally have a clearer idea.

                              <span>Five months after release, Arkane Studios&#x27; beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received its long-promised 60fps mode on Xbox Series X/S, as part of a major patch that also brings improved performance on PC, stealth takedowns, increased enemy counts, and more.


A 60fps mode for Redfall was first touted back in April, after publisher Bethesda broke the news its game would be locked to 1440p and 30fps on both Xbox Series X and S at launch. At the time, the studio said a 60fps &quot;performance mode&quot; would be added at some point after release - although it&#x27;s doubtful many were expecting it to take five moths to arrive.


Redfall&#x27;s performance mode comes as part of a substantial update for Xbox Series X/S and PC touching on everything from gameplay and performance to accessibility. Patch notes promise &quot;improved PC performance and stability across a wide range of hardware configurations&quot;, for instance, alongside fixes for memory crashes and graphical corruption on AMD GPUs.

                              <span>Life may be full of regrets, but if one of those regrets is that you decided to call your Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 character Bumfart the Third in a moment of weakness, there&#x27;s some good news: the game&#x27;s latest hotfix will finally let you change their ill-conceived name.


That&#x27;s the headline feature for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Hotfix #9 (or at least it is if you&#x27;re a remorseful Bumfart), but there&#x27;s more where that came from. The Magic Mirror, for instance, will - as well as enabling the aforementioned renaming unshaming - allow you to customise your hirelings if their outward appearance isn&#x27;t to your liking.


Developer Larian notes the same restrictions apply to hirelings that apply when changing the appearance of the player character - presumably meaning you can give them a full aesthetic makeover to suit your dubious whims but you&#x27;re stuck with their original race, sub race, and any cosmetic modifications resulting from gameplay.

So prepare to be showered in additional greatness when Dave the Diver&#x27;s first proper content updates arrives &quot;real soon&quot;.


Dave the Diver&#x27;s previous big update, which released in August, was predominantly focused on quality of life improvements, and while there&#x27;re plenty more of those stuffed into October&#x27;s update, we get a bunch of new content too.


The glacier area, for instance - which primarily exists as a story-focused location with fewer missions compared to its counterparts right now - will receive new quests. Additionally, the ocean is set to welcome new species - crabs and lobsters - both requiring players to use special traps to catch. Oh, and a lobster party event will be added to coincide with their arrival.

The latest feature teased by Barone is maybe the most important one in the update - wearable hats for pets.
A range of headwear for pets will be available, including a very cute bow, allowing players to dress up their farm pets.

For those of you wondering, a full team in Redfall multiplayer is made up of four players. Over the past week, Redfall&#x27;s concurrent Steam player count dropped to a low of three, as recorded by SteamDB. Its peak during that same period of time is 38.
Redfall&#x27;s launch didn&#x27;t go as parent company Microsoft had hoped, as Phil Spencer revealed the company had expected the game to review much higher than it did.

This map, which is described as an &quot;urban battleground&quot; was unveiled as part of Call of Duty: Next. It will arrive with the first season of Modern Warfare 3 sometime in December. 


Urzikstan is in Western Asia and borders the  Republic of Adal. Call of Duty regulars will know this area as the location of Warzone&#x27;s Al Mazrah map.

                              <span>We finally have a release date for American Arcadia: 15th November on PC (via Steam). So, if you are anything like me and rather looking forward to this release, thankfully there is not too much longer to wait. 


If you are unsure of what American Arcadia is all about, I will give you a little overview. It is by Out of the Blue, the same studio that gave us 2020&#x27;s rather special Call of the Sea, and set in the &quot;retro-futuristic &#x27;70 metropolis&quot; Arcadia.


On the outside, Arcadia seems to promise its residents a life of cushy luxury, but all is not what it seems. In fact, the Arcadia residents are all part of a TV show, and they have no idea they are being recorded for the entertainment of the wider public (think The Truman Show). But, it is not all as innocent as that (not that that is especially innocent, really). You see, if the viewers don&#x27;t like someone, well, it could end in their death. And this is something that our poor everyday man Trevor Hills is trying to avoid.

                              <span>As you may recall, earlier this year Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4 requires players to create new characters each season. And, with season two just around the corner, we thought it would be a good idea to let you know how to ensure you don&#x27;t lose your stash as well as your character. 


When Diablo 4&#x27;s current season - Season of the Malignant - comes to an end, players will see their seasonal characters moved over to the Eternal Realm with all their items - but there&#x27;s a time limit to recover them. 


Items will be found in your stash in a new  &quot;Withdraw Only Stash tab&quot;. But don&#x27;t get complacent, as they won&#x27;t stay here forever. If you want to withdraw any of your items from this chest, you will need to make sure you do so before Diablo 4&#x27;s second season comes to a close. Otherwise, they will become &quot;unrecoverable&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft plans to finally buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn next Friday, 13th October, according to a fresh report from The Verge.


That date is still contingent on the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority giving the deal an official green light - though the regulator has already signalled it is likely to do so. 


The CMA has until 18th October to weigh in with its final decision, following a deadline today for feedback on the deal&#x27;s revised form - now Microsoft has agreed to sell off streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14 players have been analysing a pair of legs in a bid to work out the next playable race to be added to the game.


Earlier this week, the game&#x27;s latest patch (6.5) was released and in its ending cutscene there&#x27;s a pair of legs that appear to be from a potential new playable race.


Reddit user Drbiohazmat has datamined the legs to find out some more detail: the legs have hair all over, a unique running and jumping animation, and a hole where a tail should be.

Up to 2000 films will be available through Sony Pictures Core. Users of the app will also be able to buy select Sony Pictures films during an exclusive, earlier period. In select regions including the UK, France, Germany, and Japan, the first film which will be available to buy earlier will be the Gran Turismo movie.

                              <span>Payday 3 has had a rather rocky start, with server issues plaguing its launch leaving many unable to play the always-online heist shooter. Now, another rock has made its way onto that already bumpy road, with developer Starbreeze announcing it has chosen to delay its upcoming patch. 


This patch was initially meant to be released yesterday, 5th October, and address &quot;200+ QoL-improvements for all platforms&quot;. However, the developer has pushed it back until an unspecified time in mid-October. This, the Payday 3 team has said, is to &quot;ensure its stability&quot;.


&quot;The patch needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again,&quot; Starbreeze explained. In a follow up post, the team confirmed that this will mean the game&#x27;s &quot;PS5 bonus content will remain unredeemable until this patch is ready&quot;.

Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the Songbirds and Zimmerman.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the topic of video game industry layoffs, something that seems to be rarely out of the headlines over the past few weeks and months. 
Layoffs are nothing new, of course, but this year in particular feels like a particularly tough time, at companies big and small. From tech giants such as Microsoft and Epic Games down to development studios such as Telltale Games, the bad news just keeps on coming. 
We discussed the job losses at Creative Assembly last week following the cancellation of Hyenas. Since then, we&#x27;ve heard of deep cuts at Team17, and more job losses on Dragon Age. We consider these examples and more, and consider whether each is part of a wider pattern, or a more individual example. Joining me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

News of layoffs at Telltale began circulating after cinematic artist Jonah Huang - who&#x27;s worked at the studio in both its current and original incarnation, which closed down in 2018 - claimed the studio &quot;laid most of us off early September&quot;.


Huang also appeared to imply further troubles for The Wolf Among Us 2 - which was originally due to release this year before Telltale pushed it back into 2024 to avoid burnout and crunch - saying he couldn&#x27;t comment on the status of its development due to a binding NDA.

                              <span>It feels like forever ago that For the King 2 - the sequel to IronOak Games&#x27; wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure - was announced (it was actually about 18 months ago, it turns out), but it finally has a release date and is coming to Steam on 2nd November.


For the King 2, which is set some 20 years after the events of the first game, promises another bout of optionally co-operative rogue-like adventuring - this time for up to four pals both locally and online - as players take on the kingdom of Fahrul&#x27;s tyrannical queen. 


Everything shown so far suggests the sequel is more about refinement than radical reinvention, meaning you should expect the same blend of familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat story generation through and randomised narrative events, only this time with a few notable tweaks.

                              <span>Bungie is being sued by a former HR manager who claims she was fired from the Destiny 2 developer after flagging a potential case of racial discrimination with her supervisors.


As reported by IGN, former Bungie HR manager Ingrid Alm - who joined the studio in May 2022 - filed a complaint in the state of Washington earlier this year, citing retaliation and wrongful termination. Alm alleges she was fired from Bungie after being asked to investigate a Black employee, referred to as &quot;James Smith&quot; in court documents, who responded by saying he felt he was being racially targeted by his supervisor.


As a result, Alm recommended Smith&#x27;s supervisor receive diversity training, but says her suggestion was met with &quot;hostility and denial&quot; - it&#x27;s claimed she was told the supervisor had &quot;been there for a long time&quot; and was &quot;highly regarded&quot; - and her recommendation was denied.

                              <span>Just a week after announcing it was delaying fishing horror Dredge&#x27;s first paid expansion, The Iron Rig, into 2024, developer Black Salt Games has unveiled an entirely different paid expansion, The Pale Reach, which arrives on 16th November.


The Pale Reach plots a course for a &quot;new, frozen frontier&quot;, where players will need to navigate treacherous icy canyons - soon also likely to succumb to the malevolence seen elsewhere in the game - following the trail of a long-forgotten expedition to see what became of its crew.


It&#x27;s a trip that&#x27;ll first require players to equip their boat with specialised gear capable of smashing through the ice, and once the voyage is underway, there&#x27;ll be new story content, 11 new fish and crab species (as well as their aberrated counterparts), a new fish type, plus new achievements and trophies. Black Salt Games also teases a new item that&#x27;ll extend &quot;the freshness of catches no matter where you&#x27;re fishing&quot;, over on the PlayStation Blog.

That meant, under Slovakia’s election rules, the post was difficult to widely debunk. And, because the post was audio, it exploited a loophole in Meta’s manipulated-media policy, which ...</span>

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 is on a bit of a roll at the moment. Following its recently released Phantom Liberty expansion and the base game&#x27;s extensive 2.0 update, developer CD Projekt Red has announced a partnership with Anonymous Content to develop a brand-new, live-action story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077. I wonder if they will bring Idris Elba and Keanu Reeves back for the occasion?


This live-action project is still in the very early stages of development, with the studios involved still on the hunt for a screenwriter to take the lead.


While the search continues, several members from media company Anonymous Content have been confirmed to be on board. Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, and Bard Dorros will all be part of this project&#x27;s production, which CDPR said will be developed in &quot;close collaboration&quot; with Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s creative team.

The data breach was carried out by the Clop ransomware group, Bleeping Computer reports. Sony is now contacting anyone affected and is offering credit monitoring and identity restoration services.
In correspondence notifying affected individuals of the breach, Sony said it is &quot;not aware of publication or misuse&quot; of the personal details exposed during the hack.

This latest figure comes hot on the heels of the game&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion, and that rather hefty 2.0 update that added new content to the base game. 


The news was welcomed with many congratulating the developer on its latest milestone.

Pokétsume has been made in collaboration with The Pokémon Company, and stars actress and former girl group member Nishino Nanase as Madoka Akagi, an adult who finds out the working world is not how she dreamt it would be. Her mother sends her her old Game Boy and Pokémon Red cartridge, and she decides to start playing Pokémon again.
As she carries on playing Pokémon Red, Madoka begins to find the same energy as her game character to work through her hardships in real life.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Rockstar quietly added a 60fps toggle to Red Dead Redemption on PlayStation 5. The game, which was released back in August for both PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, can be played on PS5 thanks to backwards compatibility. And now, that little toggle gives PlayStation 5 users a new framerate to play around with while exploring the Wild West. 


However, there are some Xbox Series X/S players who are now feeling rather left out by Rockstar, asking where their 60fps Red Dead Redemption port is.


When Rockstar brought Red Dead Redemption to PlayStation 4 and Switch, it directed its Xbox community to the original 360 version of the game. As Digital Foundry noted earlier this year, the Xbox Series X and One X versions of Red Dead Redemption are running on the 360 code, with a higher resolution, anisotropic filtering, and a negative LOD bias to enhance texture mip-maps.

The Competition and Markets Authority is still wrapping up its original extended investigation into Microsoft over its proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, with concerns over the deal&#x27;s impact on cloud gaming proving a key issue.


Now, Ofcom has referred the public cloud infrastructure services market to the CMA for investigation over competition concerns.

                              <span>Mobile developer Hutch Games has corrected store listings for two of its free-to-play games following complaints filed with the UK Advertising Standards Authority, and described its omission of explicit disclosure of loot boxes a &quot;mistake&quot;.
The complaints were made by researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who has conducted studies on the effectiveness of Belgium&#x27;s loot box ban and the consistency of loot box warnings on games.  
Xiao filed complaints regarding Hutch Games for Rebel Racing on the Google Play Store and F1 Clash - Car Racing Manager on the Apple App Store, and said that both games failed to mention the presence of loot boxes. Current ASA guidance states advertising must make it clear if loot boxes exist in a game, with a notification on store pages at a minimum.

                              <span>When Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition is released, it will be the first two disc PlayStation 5 game. 


A social media post showing the back of the Complete Edition&#x27;s box reveals that the physical copy of the game will be shipped on two blu-ray discs. Users will need to ensure they have plenty of free space before cracking on with Aloy&#x27;s latest outings, as a minimum of 121GB is required for installation.


While Aloy&#x27;s escapades across America will be the first game to release across two discs on PlayStation 5, it won&#x27;t be the only title to do so. Earlier this year, Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will also be on two discs. This game is set to release next year.

                              <span>A group of former BioWare staff members has launched a lawsuit to seek better severance pay from the maker of Mass Effect and Dragon Age. 

50 staff were let go in August, as part of a move the company said would make the studio &quot;more agile and more focused&quot;. Several veteran team members were included in the cuts, including two writers who had each worked at the studio for over 20 years.

                              <span>Get your trigger fingers at the ready. Feral Interactive, the team behind the recent Lara Croft Switch ports, has announced Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal will be coming to iOS, Android and Nintendo Switch.


This release will be a souped up version of IO&#x27;s 2006 release Hitman: Blood Money, promising a &quot;suite of improvements&quot; across the new platforms. This will include new features such as &quot;Instinct Mode, an ever-present minimap, and a wide array of gameplay improvements inspired by later games in the series&quot;. 


Here is a little trailer for it all, showing off some of 47&#x27;s shenanigans across the globe, from Paris to New Orleans (you know what, assassinations aside, 47 has quite a peachy job. I would love such opportunities to see the world).

                              <span>Twitch has seen another round of layoffs, though full details are unknown.


The news comes from streaming insider Zack Bussey and has since been corroborated by GamesIndustry.biz. The layoffs are said to be limited to the customer experience team as the company shifts to outsourced vendors.


The layoffs are also fewer than the 400 employees who lost their jobs during Amazon cuts in March.

Presenting Elephant Mario 64, a combination of work between a group of modders, known as SM64ex-coop, to add Elephant Mario to Super Mario 64. He&#x27;s fully playable, minus any Elephant form abilities, and is complete with a tiny tail sticking out from his overalls.
The model was made by modder Koop the Koopa, with some alterations from YouTuber Unreal (no, not that one) to allow for colour customisation. The bottom of Elephant Mario&#x27;s feet are pink and can&#x27;t be changed due to how the model is structured, Unreal notes, but I rather like it. It makes it look like he&#x27;s got a bunch of toe beans on his soles.

                              <span>A new report has alleged that Hyenas, the recently cancelled space-set loot shooter from Creative Assembly, was Sega&#x27;s &quot;biggest budget game ever&quot;.


YouTube channel Volound shared an eye-opening video on the recent cancellation, with claims from anonymous developers detailing a &quot;total lack of direction&quot; around the game, with one contributor stating many members of the leadership team were &quot;asleep at the wheel but they never seemed to lose their jobs&quot;. The same source noted an engine change and &quot;not committing to doing anything adventurous with the game&quot; were all part of Hyenas&#x27; ultimate demise. 


Another contributor said that internal feedback on the game was poor, adding it was felt that Hyenas would &quot;melt into the background of an already saturated multiplayer shooter market&quot;. These claims have since also been corroborated by VGC.

                              <span>Five former Ubisoft staff members have been detained by police and questioned over allegations of sexual misconduct while employees of the company.


These ex-employees included the company&#x27;s now-disgraced chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, once the right-hand man to Ubisoft&#x27;s overall boss Yves Guillemot, as well as its former editoral boss Tommy François, French newspaper Libération reported today.


The five ex-Ubisoft employees were reportedly picked up by police over the past 24 hours and questioned at a police station in Paris. The action comes three years after claims of sexual misconduct involving Hascoët, François and others came to light, as part of a wave of allegations that rocked Ubisoft in the summer of 2020. Both Hascoët and François departed the company shortly afterwards.

Shared on X, formerly Twitter, the four screenshots show some new areas: an interior home and shop, a vivid forest, a mermaid fountain in (presumably) the town square, and a creepy library with a peering skeleton.


That forest screenshot also shows the character shooting at a leafy creature with a bow and arrow, suggestive of the increased combat focus compared with Stardew.

                              <span>The free-to-play MOBA-meets-hero-shooter game Gigantic is being revived for a &quot;limited time throwback event&quot;.

Fans of the game began receiving emails yesterday from Gearbox Publishing, née Perfect World Entertainment, inviting them to play Gigantic from 5th to 7th October.

Gigantic was released in 2017 as an Xbox One and PC exclusive. Almost exactly one year later, developer Motiga closed Gigantic following its struggle to &quot;break through in a crowded market&quot;. The game was delisted and its servers were shut down.

                              <span>Ahead of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s launch, Nintendo released a quietly devastating trailer for its game that showed a real life, &#x27;everyday&#x27; man going about his business in a rather subdued manner. 


Even his home life seemed to have become mundane, with him and his wife only really seeing each other briefly after a long day in the office, before she popped off to bed. Well, thank goodness for Zelda, as not only did Tears of the Kingdom give a welcome boost to our suffering man&#x27;s evening, it now seems that it has also improved his marriage. 


In a new trailer, we are once again reunited with Nintendo&#x27;s sad man and his wife, and once again, he is playing Zelda. But, oh! He seems to be having a bit of trouble with one of the game&#x27;s many shrines. His partner looks over, and gives some sage advice. &quot;Ah, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done,&quot; he seems to think, while throwing her an adoring smile (honestly, it is so pure and lovely, and kind of the way my dog looks at food).

                              <span>Nintendo has announced it is ending online play services for both the 3DS and Wii U. These services will be terminated &quot;as of early April 2024,&quot; the company wrote in an update earlier today. 


Nintendo has been steadily winding down its support for these older consoles, having sunsetted the eShop for both platforms last year. Of course, this had no effect on the online play capabilities of the games. 


However, as of April next year, games on either the Wii U or 3DS will only be playable offline. This means &quot;online cooperative play, internet rankings and data distribution&quot; will also be affected. It also means no more online town hopping in Animal Crossing: New Leaf (pictured above).

                              <span>This year&#x27;s MineCon Live - developer Mojang&#x27;s annual celebration of all things Minecraft - is right around the corner, and ahead of the big day on 15th October, the studio is holding its yearly mob vote, with choice number one having now been revealed as the crab.


Minecraft&#x27;s annual mob vote, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, gives players the chance to collectively decide on the creature they&#x27;d like to see added to the blockbusting survival sandbox next. Previously mob votes have resulted in the likes of the Glow Squid, Panda, Phantom, Llama, and Sniffer all ending up in-game, and the crab is now vying for a place in that illustrious line-up.


As per Mojang&#x27;s animated video introducing the crab, should voters shunt the little fella into first place, it&#x27;ll be found within the mangrove swamp biome. We&#x27;re also told about its crab claw, which, once acquired, will enable players to place blocks further away than would normally be possible - a bit of a builder-focused utility, then, this one.

                              <span>Nearly 18 months after its initial unveiling, Blizzard&#x27;s free-to-play strategy game Warcraft Rumble has a release date and will be launching for iOS and Android on 3rd November, its arrival coinciding with the start of this year&#x27;s BlizzCon.


Warcraft Rumble - formerly known as Warcraft Arclight Rumble - promises a blend of strategy and tower defense across a its 70-mission single-player campaign, which features some familiar heroes and villains from the Warcraft universe, including Warsong chieftain Grommash Hellscream and Archmage Jaina Proudmoore.


In order to tackle Rumbles&#x27; various scenarios, players must assemble an army, choosing leaders, troops, and spells from the game&#x27;s 65+ collectible character Minis, each of which has its own distinctive &quot;talents&quot; for use in battle. These also come into play across Rumble&#x27;s other modes and features, including co-op, PvP, guilds, raids, and dungeons.

                              <span>Dene Carter, perhaps best known as the co-creator of the original Fable and developer Bullfrog&#x27;s much-loved Dungeon Keeper, has released his brand new Ultima-inspired roguelike RPG Moonring on Steam, and he&#x27;s made it completely free.


Carter describes Moonring as a &quot;retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games&quot; - albeit one &quot;created from the ground up with modern design sensibilities&quot; - and it all plays out across the mysterious land of Caldera, a place of &quot;Devotion and Dreamers, Gods and Gifts&quot;, where players take on the role of Dreamless.


&quot;Travel, trade, sneak, fight and sail the world of Caldera,&quot; teases Moonring&#x27;s Steam page. &quot;Speak with the townsfolk, learn Caldera&#x27;s secrets, and challenge the Archon for his throne... or even overthrow the Gods themselves!&quot;.

The trailer shows some moments of multiplayer gameplay, as well as some short glimpses of the 16 maps from the original Modern Warfare 2 that have been &quot;modernised for fast-paced combat&quot;.
Multiplayer will feature new modes, including a 3v3v3 mode called Cutthroat, and new Battle Maps alongside usual staples like Hardpoint and Kill Confirmed.

                              <span>Xbox has announced its next special edition wireless controller called Gold Shadow.

The controller is inspired by the official Shadow range of controllers released during the lifetime of the Xbox One. It has a gold-to-black metallic finish on the front, creating an illusion of a shadow cast at the bottom of the grips, while the rest of the controller is carbon black.

The gold metallic finish extends to the D-pad. There are rubberised diamond-pattern side grips, unlike your bog standard Xbox controller.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced the next wave of titles coming to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service. 


As previously confirmed, from today (3rd October) you can get your hands on Gotham Knights (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X S) and The Lamplighter&#x27;s League (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X S). 

Gotham Knights got a mixed response from our Chris Donlan upon its release last year. He called it a &quot;slight muddle of a game&quot;, but noted it still &quot;has its pleasures&quot; in Eurogamer&#x27;s review.

                              <span>Epic has announced it&#x27;s introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it calls its evolution into a &quot;multi-game ecosystem&quot;.


Third-party developed content in Fortnite has become an increasing focus for Epic in recent times, and the company introduced its Unreal Editor for Fortnite tools - also known as Creative 2.0 - back in March. These enable creators to bring fully fledged Unreal Editor experiences into Fortnite, complete with custom assets, animations, audio, and advanced VFX effects, in a bid to turn the game into a creator-led platform closer to the likes of Roblox.


And now, as its &quot;multi-game ecosystem&quot; ambitions grow, Epic has announced it&#x27;ll be making age ratings mandatory for all first- and third-party playable experiences in Fortnite as of 14th November this year.

                              <span>Sony has announced a PlayStation 5 bundle which includes Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2. 


This bundle is set to release alongside the game on 20th October. As with earlier bundles for the likes of God of War: Ragnarök and Horizon Forbidden West, it will come with the standard PS5 console and a voucher to download a copy of the game.


While Sony hasn&#x27;t officially released a price for this upcoming deal, according to Kotaku the bundle will cost $560 (so around £465), offering a small saving on buying the console and game separately. This is also cheaper than the previously announced Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 limited edition bundle, which includes themed-hardware. That deal will set you back £569.99.

Naughty Dog is cutting contracts short for outsourced developers, and sources say no severance pay is being given to those laid off. Both remaining employees and laid off developers are allegedly &quot;being pressured to keep the news quiet&quot;.

                              <span>NetherRealm has released its latest patch for Mortal Kombat 1. 


This patch addresses a range of issues across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including general fixes and character specific adjustments. However, the Nintendo Switch version of the game remains left out in the cold, at least for now, despite Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon previously promising fixes.


Sharing the patch notes online, Boon said the team will &quot;kontinue to listen&quot; and keep &quot;lines of communication open&quot; as it continues to improve its game (I just wish Boon would be a little more konsistent with his use of Ks).

This collection, which is set to include all three of Rocksteady&#x27;s games - Arkham Asylum, Arkham City and Arkham Knight - as well as all DLC, was originally due to release on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console later this month. 


However, a post on the official Batman Arkham Twitter account said the team has made the decision to delay the launch to ensure Switch users get the &quot;best possible experience&quot; on release.

                              <span>Epic Games has stated it is &quot;looking into&quot; a lack of royalty payments to Hato Moa, the creator of the original Hatoful Boyfriend game.

The pigeon dating sim was an amateur project made by Moa and it was released in 2011 in Japanese. The game gained popularity following fan translations into English, and a HD remake was developed by Mediatonic. Hatoful Boyfriend HD was published in 2014 by Devolver Digital. 

Mediatonic was acquired by Epic in 2021. Last week, Mao stated they have received &quot;no royalty payment&quot; since the acquisition and voiced their frustration on Twitter.

                              <span>After 10 years, one Final Fantasy 14 player has finally earned all 2751 achievements.


The feat was done by a Japanese player on the Garuda server and shared on the Final Fantasy 14 subreddit (spotted by GamesRadar). Community data tracker Lalachievements has corroborated the claim.


The game&#x27;s Achievement list is notorious, requiring a huge amount of time and dedication to complete.

                              <span>EA Sports FC 24 players are fuming at an Ultimate Team mode card pack costing around £30.


The Elite Season Opener Pack costs 285,000 coins (the in-game currency) or 3000 FC Points (premium currency) and seemingly includes such powerful cards that players are accusing EA of pay-to-win tactics.


And this is a microtransaction in a game that already costs £70.

I&#x27;m talking about, of course, His Majesty the cat. Formerly a sphynx cat, he was changed into a different breed to differentiate him between another bald cat encountered later on in the story.

I&#x27;ve been slowly chugging through Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and two months after its release on PC, I finally reached Act Two this weekend. Upon meeting His Majesty for the first time last night, my initial reaction was &quot;ah, this is the bald cat everyone was upset about,&quot; and I can understand why. With the hair, he just doesn&#x27;t command the same respect.

The developer recently released a new image for GTA Online&#x27;s Moon Festival, which you can see above. This image was shared as part of a blog post about GTA Online which - on the surface at least - was all fairly standard stuff.


But it&#x27;s the Moon Festival image which is getting attention - as some fans believe Rockstar is actually teasing the series&#x27; next entry in this seemingly straightforward picture.

Pioneers of Pagonia was revealed back in February, promising a city building adventure set across the mysterious islands of Pagonia, where players must work to steadily increase their reach and influence among the islands&#x27; many (not always friendly) inhabitants through resource gathering, production, economic expansion, and exploration.


When Pioneers of Pagonia enters early access in December, only some of its final features will be available, including procedural map generation, over 40 different building types, plus more than 70 different goods and dispersed production chains. The likes of co-op play, new buildings, new production chains, and other improvements are expected to arrive in the six months or so of development planned ahead of a full 1.0 release.

                              <span>Sergiy Galyonkin, director of publishing strategy at Epic Games - and creator of Steam analytics website Steam Spy - has announced his departure from the Fortnite maker after nearly eight years, saying he is &quot;not a good fit&quot; for the &quot;new version of Epic&quot;.


Galyonkin&#x27;s career in the games industry spans more than two decades but he gained renown after establishing Steam Spy in 2015, a project he continued to run after joining Epic as Eastern European head of publishng in 2016. A year later, Galyonkin became the company&#x27;s director of publishing strategy, with a specific focus on Epic&#x27;s store, and he&#x27;s remained in that role since. 


Now, though, Galyonkin has revealed his time at the company is over. &quot;Today is officially my last day at Epic Games,&quot; he wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;These eight years have been some of the most exciting in my career, and I am deeply grateful to my former Epic Games colleagues and Tim Sweeney for allowing me to help build Epic 4.0.&quot;

It’s a complicated crime to monetize, though. You need to sell access to the gas pump to others.</span>

                              <span>The NSA is starting a new artificial intelligence security center:
The AI security center’s establishment follows an NSA study that identified securing AI models from theft and sabotage as a major national security challenge, especially as generative AI technologies emerge with immense transformative potential for both good and evil.
Nakasone said it would become “NSA’s focal point for leveraging foreign intelligence insights, contributing to the development of best practices guidelines, principles, evaluation, methodology and risk frameworks” for both AI security and the goal of promoting the secure development and adoption of AI within “our national security systems and our defense industrial base.”...</span>

                              <span>Six games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass in the next two weeks, including Trek to Yomi. 


Want to know more about Trek to Yomi? Well, let me quickly samurai-se it for you. In Trek to Yomi, which is set in Japan during the Edo period, players take on the role of a young warrior named Hiroki. Hiroki will have to face the &quot;forces of evil&quot; as he tries to make amends for failing to protect his village from a brutal onslaught.


The Black-and-white samurai curio is set to leave the service on 16th October, so if you were interested in taking up your sword and having a go for yourself, but hadn&#x27;t managed to get round to it yet, this is a little reminder to snap it up while you can.

There&#x27;s little detail on what exactly has been agreed between the two parties - though the statement claims this settlement covers &quot;all their disputes&quot;. 


&quot;Failbetter and Alexis Kennedy are pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable settlement of all their disputes, and by such settlement have drawn a line under their long-standing disagreements,&quot; reads a brief statement from Failbetter posted on X, formerly Twitter.

                              <span>EA Sports FC 24 is the second-biggest boxed game launch of 2023 here in the UK, though physical sales are down by 30 percent on last year&#x27;s FIFA 23.


The rebranded FIFA bumped boxed game juggernaut Hogwarts Legacy into third place in terms of the biggest 2023 UK physical game launches. Only The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold more. 


While boxed sales are declining across the board, annual mass market titans FIFA and Call of Duty have held onto a sizable - if shrinking - slice of physical sales. A further drop in boxed numbers this year was somewhat inevitable, though a 30 percent fall is something of a jump.

                              <span>A new bug has been discovered in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet which causes the game to crash during the last battle of its main story questline.

The bug appears to have been introduced with patch 2.0.1, which rolled out alongside the DLC The Teal Mask on 13th September.

Players have identified what triggers the game to crash and work-arounds whilst the bug persists. Here&#x27;s the short version - if you have already registered the Legendary Paradox Pokémon which is native to your version of the game, don&#x27;t try to swap Pokémon in slots four to six of your party into battle. Light spoilers below for the long version.

The company&#x27;s CEO Michael Pattison is also expected to leave, sources close to the company say.


Around 50 roles - the vast majority of Team17&#x27;s QA department - are at risk as part of a major restructuring process, as the company opts to outsource its QA work instead.

                              <span>Scalpers have been spotted on sites such as Ebay reselling merchandise from the Pokémon Center Van Gogh Museum collaboration which began last week.
The exhibit at the museum in Amsterdam consists of six paintings of Pokémon in the style of Van Gogh, accompanied by a range of exclusive merchandise and a special Pikachu trading card. Sadly, footage of the exhibit&#x27;s opening day, showed visitors hurriedly grabbing whatever merch they could to resell.

The merch was also available to buy on Pokémon Center webstores, though it quickly sold out. The items appear to have been prevented from appearing when searching on the UK Pokémon Center website, though the pages can still be found through search engines.

                              <span>PayDay 3&#x27;s matchmaking issues have been fixed, developer Starbreeze has announced. 


In a new release, the developer stated scheduled maintenance had successfully addressed the server issues that plagued Payday 3&#x27;s launch and prevented players from actually being able to play the game. Starbreeze said matchmaking is now &quot;stable&quot; and has &quot;good performance&quot;. 


In addition, the developer has said it will now &quot;intensify&quot; Payday 3&#x27;s commercial activities, having put these on pause as it tried to sort out those matchmaking issues. This will include an update, due early this month, that will see &quot;200+&quot; quality of life improvements added across platforms.

                              <span>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre players have hit back at the game&#x27;s monetisation strategy after Gun and Sumo outlined its plans for upcoming DLC.

&quot;We&#x27;ve seen some discussion, and for transparency, we wanted to share pricing for any and all future content for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,&quot; the team stated via a statement posted to its social media channels, including Twitter/X.

The tweet went on to give prices for upcoming skins and characters, confirming &quot;premium content&quot; – such as a Leatherface skin designed by Greg Nicotero – will cost $16, new characters, both victim and family, will sell for $10, executions $7, and clothing and weapon cosmetics for $5. Other content, such as &quot;maps, etc.&quot;, will be released for free.

                              <span>Starfield was &quot;made to played for a long time&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to Bethesda boss Todd Howard himself, who said in a Game Maker’s Notebook interview with Insomniac CEO Ted Price that after watching how players interact with other Bethesda RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout, he believes &quot;people want to play [games] for a very long time&quot;.

&quot;This is a game that&#x27;s intentionally made to be played for a long time. One of the things we’ve learned from our previous games, like Skyrim, like Fallout, is that people want to play them for a very long time,&quot; said Howard, as transcribed by VGC.

The 2023 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 4 of which were up for election in 2023. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.
This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s continued health and success.
Results
Congratulations to the elected committee members whose two year terms begin immediately (listed in alphabetical order by GitHub handle):

                              <span>A rare N64 controller is set to sell for around £1000 after its owner found the item in his attic after being gifted the now hard-to-find Foxdata N64 pad on their fourteenth birthday.

It&#x27;s one of four designs issued by Foxdata in the late 1990s, which included controllers called Desert Storm, Red Rain, Purple Forest, and Chrome Leopard. 

Liam Clousdale – who had the latter Leopard variant – said he&#x27;d asked for the distinctive controller so that when he went to his friends&#x27; homes to play, &quot;everyone liked to have their own unique pad [...] to avoid confusion&quot;.

For one day only, Wardens will be &quot;running around the dungeons full of treasure&quot;, so players – of which there are now 460,000, according to Ironmace – are invited to &quot;try their luck and catch one&quot;.

&quot;Time flies! It has been a year since QA Playtest 1,&quot; Dark and Darker Discord admin Graysun announced (thanks, PCGN).

In a blog on the Gran Turismo site, the team confirmed &quot;end of online service&quot; will begin on 1st December, when DLC will be removed from the PlayStation Store, although all previously purchased DLC and &quot;offline portions&quot; of the game will remain accessible after shutdown. 

The statement explained that after Gran Turismo Sport&#x27;s online services are shuttered, the team will then &quot;continue to further improve the online services&quot; for Gran Turismo 7.

                              <span>Techland has pulled back the cover on what&#x27;s coming up for its zombie shooter, Dying Light 2 Stay Human.

In a new trailer outlining its content roadmap, the studio vowed to keep supporting the game with more activities, including co-op missions, Tower Raid, replayable GRE anomalies, and the return of Tolga and Fatin. 

Players can also expect more graphic options, such as the ability to turn the bloom effect on and off, an FOV slider for Xbox Series S, and quality of life improvements to things like weapon repairing, gear and mod dismantling, and a host of new cosmetics and customisations, as well as new enemy variants.

The Pokémon exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam opened earlier this week, where a load of new Pokemon x Van Gogh merch was available, including a free trading card of a Van Gogh Pikachu designed to look like he was painted by the Dutch master himself. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, though, scalpers were quick to descend on the Van Gogh Museum, leaving many fans disappointed.

                              <span>&quot;Strategic crafting shooter&quot; United 1944 invites you to try before you buy and participate in its beta playtest.

                              <span>From Nature:
Cephalopods such as octopuses and squid could soon receive the same legal protection as mice and monkeys do when they are used in research. On 7 September, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) asked for feedback on proposed guidelines that, for the first time in the United States, would require research projects involving cephalopods to be approved by an ethics board before receiving federal funding.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bit of bad news if you&#x27;ve been looking forward to fishing horror Dredge&#x27;s first paid expansion: developer Black Salt Games has delayed its release from Q4 this year into 2024.


More Dredge, both free and paid, was confirmed to be on the way back in May, with the game&#x27;s The Iron Rig expansion - focusing on the machinations of the Ironhaven Corporation - looking to be its most significant chunk of new content.


&quot;Originally, we planned to spend a few months crafting this exciting addition and release it in Q4 this year,&quot; Black Salt Games explained in its delay announcement. &quot;However, as we progressed, we were faced with the reality that, given the time of the year, we&#x27;d need more lead time to coordinate our marketing and make the launch as exciting as it could be.&quot;

                              <span>CD Projekt has detailed Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s first patch since the sci-fi RPG&#x27;s big 2.0 update, promising, among other things, a fix for a save corruption issue affecting PlayStation 5 players.


As per the developer&#x27;s newly shared pre-release patch highlights, update 2.01 should stop instances of corrupt saves on PS5 by increasing the maximum save file size limit. CD Projekt warns this won&#x27;t fix saves impacted before the update, but advises affected players to keep a working save - by resaving it as a manual save - until 2.01 arrives.


Elsewhere in the update, CD Projekt is promising performance improvements on both PC and consoles, particularly in the Dogtown area, as well as a range of more specific fixes, included one especially specific issue that would see V sinking through the elevator floor and plummeting to their doom when attempting to reach the 42nd floor in Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s The Heist mission - but only in instances of low FPS.

                              <span>Mediatonic, the UK developer behind Fall Guys, has been severely impacted by expected job losses as a result of yesterday&#x27;s layoffs by Epic Games, though the studio itself will not be closed.


Epic Games acquired Mediatonic back in March 2021 after the studio&#x27;s battle royale Fall Guys blew up in popularity. The deal was meant to secure Mediatonic&#x27;s future. Now, despite the studio remaining open, that future looks very different indeed.


Last night, rumours swirled that the cuts were so deep the whole studio would close. But this isn&#x27;t the case, team members I&#x27;ve spoken to have said, and Epic Games itself has now confirmed.

According to the game&#x27;s publisher Gala Games, which specialises in this blockchain/Web3 business, Legacy&#x27;s upcoming launch is &quot;more than just a game release&quot;. In its words, this is &quot;the beginning of an extraordinary journey where creativity, strategy, and business innovation meet&quot;. 


As someone who remains more than a touch sceptical about blockchain, I feel this remains to be seen.

                              <span>Following recent leaks and rumours, Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon is now teasing fans with potential future DLC for the series&#x27; most recent release. 


In a new post over on X (formerly Twitter), Boon shared an image of some of media&#x27;s most famous slasher-flick faces. Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, Jason, Mike Myers, Pinhead, Chucky, Jigsaw, and Ghostface all showed up in Boon&#x27;s image, with a collection of either ticks or question marks across their faces. 


Many have surmised this means these less than friendly faces will soon be making their way into Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the game&#x27;s DLC. As one fan noted in the replies, &quot;Jigsaw would be perfect with the new Saw coming out&quot;.

                              <span>Embracer and Sony seem to be slowly removing traces of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake from the internet, sparking more concern that its future is in jeopardy. 


It has certainly been a tumultuous journey for this remake. After numerous leaks, Aspyr and Sony officially revealed their remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was in development back in 2021. At this time, it was announced the Star Wars game was being remade &quot;from the ground up&quot;, and would launch as a timed console exclusive for PlayStation 5, and also for PC.


Since then, news on the remake has been less than optimistic. In May 2022, Aspyr&#x27;s parent company Embracer announced that Evil Dead developer Saber Interactive had joined up with Aspyr to work on the remake. Then, in July, it was reported that the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake was &quot;in serious trouble&quot; and &quot;delayed indefinitely&quot;.

                              <span>The final update for Sonic Frontiers is now live and adds playable Tails, Amy and Knuckles for the first time in a 3D game since Sonic 06.


Sega had previously teased the update would bring new playable characters, but now the update is live we know for sure it&#x27;s those three. Though let&#x27;s be honest, it was pretty obvious.


The update brings a new story expansion, which takes place before the final boss and envisions an alternative ending, with the three characters attempting to change their own fate. Check out the trailer below to see them in action.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we bid farewell to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who has announced his departure from the company after almost three decades of service. 
We look back at Ryan&#x27;s tenure at the top of Sony&#x27;s console business, which included the launch of PlayStation 5 and the acquisition of Bungie. Sony has seen huge sales successes, of course, but is this down to the company&#x27;s continued direction or simply an open goal from the last console generation? 
Announced just before we recorded this week&#x27;s show, we also discuss the shock cancellation of Hyenas, the loot shooter from Sega&#x27;s UK studio Creative Assembly that was being demoed to the public only last month. Such a last-minute scrubbing of a game launch is startling - we discuss why the decision may have been made.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s next fully fledged Elder Scrolls game might still be five-plus years away from release, but if you&#x27;re truly suffering from series withdrawal symptoms, the company has just unceremoniously shoved a Fallout Shelter-style Elder Scrolls game onto Google Play.


As spotted by IGN, The Elder Scrolls: Castles is now available to download, tasking players with managing their own, yes, castle through a steady process of room-by-room expansion, while also dealing with the whims of their kingdom - by deciding how to respond to their subjects&#x27; requests, Reigns-style - at the same time.


Oh, and there&#x27;s a questing element too, in which players will need to create heroes, kit them out with gear, and send them into battle against &quot;classic Elder Scrolls foes&quot; in order to collect resources that&#x27;ll come in hand elsewhere.

                              <span>Five years after its initial unveiling, developer Mojang has confirmed development on Minecraft Dungeons has reached its end, and that the game&#x27;s 1.17 update - which released ten months ago, back in November 2022 - will be its last.


Minecraft Dungeons, a collaboration between Mojang and developer Double Eleven, was well-received when it launched in May 2020 - Eurogamer&#x27;s Tom Phillips called it a &quot;strong extension to the franchise, and by far the most promising Minecraft spin-off released to date&quot; at the time.


By the time February 2021 rolled around, Minecraft Dungeons had amassed over 10m players, and was popular enough that a second season pass of DLC content was announced after its first came to and end. Mojang then announced it would introduce a live-service style seasonal model - complete with battle pass - as 2021 drew to a close.

Subpar Pool is described as a &quot;whimsical adventure of playful pocket antics at the intersection of golf and pool&quot;, where players are challenged to progress through four varied worlds and a series of tables by pocketing balls within a set number of shots.


Play-throughs of Subpar Pool are procedurally generated based on parameters players can set beforehand by combining cards from a special 18-strong deck to suit their particular whims, with more than 14,000 combinations said to be possible.

                              <span>Being sneaky and as sly as that proverbial fox is about to get even more up close and personal (well, for those on PlayStation - I know others have had this experience already). 


Earlier today, InnerSloth, Sony, Schell Games and Robot Teddy announced that social deduction game Among Us will be coming to PS VR2. So, get ready to grab your Crewmates and then subsequently betray them all with a quick slice here or a subtle tongue impaling here. You know, as you do. 


When Among Us makes its way onto PS VR2, players can expect the usual likes of tasks, sabotages, venting, and those frantic emergency meetings where accusations begin to fly left, right and centre. But in addition to all this, Among Us VR on PS VR2 will also include new tasks and new features designed specfically for virtual reality. This includes 3D cosmetics, proximity voice chat, accessibility and comfort settings, safety and in-game moderation tools, crossplay compatibility, and custom lobby settings.

                              <span>UPDATE 4.54pm: Epic has confirmed reports of widespread layoffs at the company, saying the move will affect &quot;around 830 employees&quot;, with approximately two-thirds of those job cuts said to be in teams &quot;outside of core development&quot;.


Around 250 employees will leave the company as a result of Epic&#x27;s newly announced divestiture of Bandcamp and SuperAwesome.


&quot;For a while now,&quot; Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in an all-staff email now shared on the company&#x27;s website, &quot;we&#x27;ve been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators. I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.

Accessibility options included in Insomniac&#x27;s previous Spider-Man games, such as Challenge Levels of various difficulties, Chase Assist, and Quick Time Event Autocomplete, will be present in the hotly awaited sequel.

                              <span>Microsoft has introduced a new update across Xbox that aims to simplify users&#x27; experiences when they set about backing up their game captures.


With this update in play, any captures stored on the Xbox network will now be deleted after 90 days. Users can check on their captures&#x27; status via the  Captures app, where any images coming close to that 90 day limit will be flagged. 


As is apparent with this &quot;new retention approach&quot;, Xbox users will need to ensure any captures they wish to keep for more than that 90 day period are backed up elsewhere or risk losing them forever.

A statement shared on X, formerly Twitter, by Creative Assembly notes beginning the consultation has been an &quot;incredibly difficult decision&quot;.

Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t address one of the annoyances introduced with Patch 3 - companions handing over their inventory to your character when they&#x27;re dismissed.

Patch 3 added the highly requested Magic Mirror in camp, allowing players to change their character&#x27;s appearance (bar race, subrace, and any &quot;cosmetic modifications&quot; made down to your own decisions).

                              <span>The FTC has once again resumed its case against Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, after a pause over the summer.


It means the FTC can still battle the deal even after it closes, reports Bloomberg, though it won&#x27;t derail its completion by 18th October.


A new order, released yesterday, states the FTC has &quot;determined that the public interest warrants that this matter be resolved fully and expeditiously. Therefore, the Commission is returning this matter to adjudication&quot;.

                              <span>Valve has failed to convince the European Union&#x27;s Court of Justice that it did not infringe EU law by geo-blocking activation keys on Steam.


Five other video game publishers were also found to have breached anti-competitive practices: Bandai Namco, Capcom, Focus Home, Koch Media and ZeniMax. 


As a reminder, the European Commission announced plans back in 2017 to investigate Valve and the aforementioned PC game publishers over suspected anti-competitive practices.

As you might expect, the Van Gogh Pikachu is designed to look like he was painted by the Dutch master himself. Better yet, the trading card is free - if you can make the trip over and visit in person. 


The Van Gogh exhibit is open from today, 28th September, until 7th January 2024.

Yesterday, Barone released more information on content in update 1.6, though reminded fans it&#x27;s still in development. Major additions in 1.6 includes a new festival, late-game content, and support for up to eight player multiplayer on PC.

Based on the company&#x27;s newer Source 2 graphical engine, Valve says the new release is &quot;the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike&#x27;s history&quot;. 


Valve says CS2 includes improved lighting, textures and mapmaking tools, &quot;overhauled&quot; and &quot;updated&quot; maps, new visual effects, reworked audio, a &quot;tickless&quot; server and a new in-game ranking system.

                              <span>Sony has announced PlayStation boss Jim Ryan will be retiring next March, after nearly 30 years with the company.


Ryan - whose official job title is president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment - took charge of the PlayStation division back in February 2019, having previously helmed Sony Computer Interactive Europe.


In a statement announcing his retirement, Ryan wrote, &quot;I&#x27;ve relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners. But I&#x27;ve found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America.

                              <span>We already knew Meta Quest 3 was on the way after Meta made its latest consumer VR headset official back in June - just days ahead of Apple&#x27;s Vision Pro reveal - but the company has now slapped it with a 10th October launch date, and pre-orders are open now.


April&#x27;s initial unveiling confirmed some top-level features for Meta&#x27;s new VR headset - which is now more accurately described as a mixed reality headset - but we now have a much clearer idea of the specs being packed into this third iteration of Quest.


Meta Quest 3 is powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor - which Meta says can manage &quot;double the graphic processing&quot; of Quest 2 - and it includes 8GB of RAM. It also sports two 120Hz LCD displays, each delivering a resolution of 2064 x 2208 - described as a 30 percent increase compared to Quest 2 - plus a 110-degrees horizontal and 96-degrees vertical field of view. Lenses have an adjustable IPD ranging from 58mm-71mm.

                              <span>How do you follow up a five-star treat like Dave the Diver? With a zombie-themed, 16-player PvPvE stealth-survival extraction game, of course! Developer Mintrocket has just unveiled its next project, titled Nakwon: Last Paradise, and it&#x27;s about as much a departure from its acclaimed snorkelling-and-sushi-restaurant-management adventure as you can get, dropping players onto the streets of Seoul, right into the middle of the undead apocalypse.


As per Mintrocket&#x27;s lengthy Steam announcement, Nakwon&#x27;s action is split into two main parts; on the Scouting side, players - with a friend in tow if desired - must leave the relative comforts of the titular safe zone to venture into the zombie-infested outskirts of Seoul. Here, the goal is to scavenge resources then escape back to safety, but other players and, of course, the AI-controlled undead, won&#x27;t make that an easy task. 


Mintrocket stresses that zombies in Nakwon are very much the hunters, and cannot be defeated. Instead, players - primarily armed with makeshift weaponry and tools rather than undead-shredding firepower, given the scarcity of guns - must navigate the streets as stealthily as possible to avoid detection, fleeing when necessary. And should they successfully make it back to the safe zone alive (it looks like players can come and go as they like, regardless of what other Survivors might be doing) the Simulation side of Nakwon begins.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s promisingly outlandish Far Cry animated adaptation is almost upon us, with the series - titled Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix - set to hit the streaming service on 19th October. And ahead of its arrival, Netflix has shared a fresh trailer showcasing its chaotic action, this one welcoming Rayman and a bunch of other familiar Ubisoft faces.


Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix takes its cue from Ubisoft&#x27;s gleefully ludicrous, 80s-inspired Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon. It&#x27;s set in an alternate version of Earth&#x27;s 1992 where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data.


Enter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex. Unfortunately, Laserhawk is betrayed by said boyfriend, landing him in high-security facility with no choice but to join forces with an unlikely bunch of rebels.

                              <span>Roughly two years after Netflix announced plans for a Tomb Raider anime, we&#x27;ve finally been given our first look at Lara Croft in cartoon action. 


The Tomb Raider animation is set to focus on the events following the reboot trilogy&#x27;s conclusion. Lara has returned from her travels in South America, having prevented an apocalypse of some description, and is now ready for her next adventure. 


Netflix&#x27;s debut trailer is quite brief, featuring a lot of heavy breathing from our heroine over the top of a handful of impactful shots. We get to see Lara abseiling into a cavernous abyss and - perhaps in homage to one of Shadow of the Tomb Raider&#x27;s better moments - emerging onto the scene while a backdrop of flames silhouettes her (presumably) rather battle weary figure. There is also a nice little nod to the Yamatai crew from the 2013 reboot, with Lara tenderly stroking a photo of her fallen friends (although, no Alex? And, I know Jonah is still alive).

                              <span>Cast your mind back to 2018, and you might recall Adi Shankar - the producer of Netflix&#x27;s acclaimed Castlevania adaptation - announcing he also had a Devil May Cry animated series in the works. Five years on, and the streaming service has now given us a first look at the show, which is supposedly coming &quot;soon&quot;.


Netflix&#x27;s animated Devil May Cry series has been made in collaboration with Capcom, and comes from Studio Mir - the animation team behind the likes of The Legend of Korra and My Adventures with Superman.


Beyond that, details are almost entirely non-existent at present, although Netflix&#x27;s announcement trailer does at least gives us a quick look at the adaptation&#x27;s interpretation of Dante, who looks to be well and truly in &quot;cocky pretty boy&quot; mode for this outing.

                              <span>Following reports earlier this year that Far Cry 7 is currently in the works at Ubisoft, story and gameplay details have emerged claiming the game will see players attempting to rescue their wealthy family, who&#x27;ve been kidnapped by a group calling itself the Sons of Truth.


That&#x27;s according to Insider Gaming, who first reported news of Far Cry 7&#x27;s development - later corroborated by Kotaku - back in January. Citing undisclosed &quot;sources&quot;, the website says Far Cry 7, codenamed Project Blackbird, will feature a &quot;non-linear&quot; story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist&#x27;s family, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.


Supposedly, the main goal of Far Cry 7 is to bring down the Sons of Truth, described as a &quot;conspiracy group&quot;, within that time frame (the timer is said to stop while within certain locations, such as safehouses), but it&#x27;s claimed players will also need to track down and rescue their family members along the way in order to &quot;100%&quot; the game.

                              <span>Acclaimed minimalist survival RPG Vampire Survivors is done with summer and is heading for frostier climes, courtesy of its next free content update, the Chilling Update, which just recieved a first trailer ahead of its arrival &quot;soon&quot;.


Poncle hasn&#x27;t laid all the specifics of Vampire Survivors new Chilling Update (also known as patch 1.7, and also also seemingly known as Whiteout), but its trailer drop came with confirmation it&#x27;ll feature a brand-new wintery stage, complete with snow-covered pines and more snowmen than you can shake an arm-shaped stick at, plus a brand-new character.


As to the identity of this newcomer, I really couldn&#x27;t say beyond the fact they have a fetching hood, based on the information currently available, but Poncle&#x27;s new trailer does confirm patch 1.7 will introduce the Glass Fandango as a new weapon - &quot;stronger with movement, Orologions, and against frozen enemies&quot; - plus new achievements, and probably a bunch of other stuff I&#x27;ve missed because I have, alas, only recently begun my Vampire Survivors journey.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has apologised for the Ukrainian localisation of Cyberpunk 2077 due to language which could be &quot;considered offensive by Russian gamers&quot; which was added in the 2.0 update last week and said it is working to add the &quot;correct lines&quot; in the next patch.

Website Zone of Games discovered differences between the English and Ukrainian scripts with altered dialogue. Since publishing its initial report, other differences within the versions of the game have surfaced.

As reported by our mates at Rock Paper Shotgun, the changes include swapping the word &quot;asshole&quot; to &quot;rusnia&quot;, a Ukrainian derogatory word for Russians. The localisation also has allusions to Russia&#x27;s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, such as a reference to &quot;Russian warship, go fuck yourself&quot;, the response of a Ukrainian border guard to a Russian warship in a widely circulated encounter near Snake Island.

                              <span>Video game statue maker Gaming Heads has claimed it was told by Sony to destroy its licensed merchandise, including items already paid for but not yet shipped to customers.


The company has shared an open letter to Sony on social media and its website, apologising to customers for the situation and stating this was &quot;PlayStation&#x27;s decision, not ours&quot;.


The items it claims to have been told to destroy include in-stock items, items ready to be shipped, items in production, and items in development. These are from a range of franchises, including The Last of Us, God of War, Bloodborne, and Ratchet &amp; Clank.

                              <span>October&#x27;s list of titles available to Amazon Prime Gaming subscribers includes the appropriately spooky Ghostwire: Tokyo, just in time for Halloween. 


There are also extras available to subscribers for the newly-launched Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, plus other regular favourites such as Fall Guys and Pokémon Go.


Tango Gameworks&#x27; first-person action horror originally launched in 2022, and boasts a &quot;spectacular, otherworldly atmosphere&quot; according to Eurogamer&#x27;s Ghostwire: Tokyo review, which simultaneously laid criticism on the game&#x27;s combat.

                              <span>Sony has announced the Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition for PlayStation 5 next month and PC early next year. 
This edition of Aloy&#x27;s latest escapades includes the base game and DLC Burning Shores, along with a selection of extras.


On PlayStation 5, the Complete Edition will launch on 6th October priced $60 / €60 / ¥7,980. I am assuming this will convert to roughly £55 here in the UK, but have emailed Sony to ask for clarification. 


The Complete Edition will then be available for PC players via Steam and Epic Game Store sometime in early 2024. This version is being handled by Nixxes Software, which was also responsible for this year&#x27;s Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart PC release.

                              <span>Ubisoft chief Yves Guillemot believes cloud streaming will be as transformative to gaming in the coming years as Netflix was to TV. 


Speaking with the Financial Times, Guillemot looked back on Netflix&#x27;s initial foray into streaming and noted the market&#x27;s early scepticism. &quot;Their shares fell a lot and they were widely criticised,&quot; he recalled. &quot;Today, we see what they have become.&quot;


Guillemot said he believes the same will eventually ring true for video game streaming as well, but admitted it will likely take some time. &quot;But when it takes off, it will happen very quickly,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 players have discovered a bug that gives player one a distinct advantage.


Certain combos executed by player one cannot be replicated by player two, a problem that persists across all playable characters and even in online multiplayer modes.


YouTuber mrAPchem uploaded a video that demonstrates the issue (thanks TheGamer), setting up a Mirror Match with Sub-Zero and attempting the same combo as both player one and player two.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 launched last week, and fans have been poring over newly added content to find all the Easter eggs  CD Projekt Red has crammed in.
One of the latest discoveries is an arcade cabinet which lets you play a Doom and Wolfenstein inspired minigame called Arasaka Tower 3D. In it, you play as Johnny Silverhand descending the 120 floors of Arasaka Tower in 2023 after he stormed the building in a bomb attack on the corporation. 
Complete with Keanu Reeves&#x27; face at the bottom of the screen, tight corridors and downsampled tracks from Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s OST, it&#x27;s got 90s FPS written all over it. That&#x27;s not all though, as players have also discovered it relates to the long-running FF:06:B5 Easter egg present in other CD Projekt Red games.

The games&#x27; removal was first noticed by X (formerly Twitter) user MauroNL3, who noted &quot;every FIFA title from 14 up to 23 can&#x27;t be purchased anymore&quot;.


I went and had a quick look for myself, and can verify this to be true.

The hugely-popular app previously charged 79p for 100 PokéCoins, the price of an in-game raid pass. As of this week, 100 PokéCoins now costs 99p.


Fans elsewhere around the world have noticed more significant changes, with the same bundle increased from 99c to CA$1.39 in Canada, AU$1.59 in Australia and NZ$1.69 in New Zealand, per reports on top Pokémon Go fan reddit The Silph Road.

                              <span>Exploring Starfield&#x27;s planets was previously a lot harder, Bethesda has revealed, before the developer decided to dial back some &quot;very punitive&quot; atmosphere effects.


The Bethesda space RPG&#x27;s many planets still feature environmental hazards, such as extreme temperatures and radiation. But the impact these have on your character is now fairly minimal - whereas previously this system would have seen players having to swap spacesuits to meet local conditions.


Bethesda boss Todd Howard revealed the change during an episode of the Game Maker&#x27;s Notebook podcast, which is well worth a watch. In it, Howard discusses the challenges of creating interesting planets, fun space combat, and what changed during Starfield&#x27;s development.

                              <span>Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen - who retired from the studio back in 2016, only to rejoin at the end of last year - has been made executive creative director of Warcraft.


Prior to his departure in 2016, Metzen, who had been with Blizzard for 23 years at that point, was head writer and lore guru at the company (more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) with a hand in all the studio&#x27;s properties.


Since rejoining Blizzard, however, Metzen has been solely focused on Warcraft (in the role of franchise creative advisor), and his new executive creative director position will continue in much the same vein, seeing Metzen focus exclusively on developing the Warfraft universe, initially with an eye on &quot;crafting the next generation of [World of Warcraft] adventures.

                              <span>Three years after making its PC debut as an Epic Games Store exclusive, Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is coming to Steam, with its release date set for 3rd October.


Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 - which originally launched for PS4, Xbox One, and Epic back in September 2020 - combines remakes of developer Neversoft&#x27;s much-loved skating games into a single, critically acclaimed package. The end result was an experience that thoroughly reinvigorated the two-decade old classics, with Digital Foundry&#x27;s John Linneman even going as far as to call Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 &quot;one of the best games of the generation&quot;.


In the three years since its record-breaking release, Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 has made the jump to Switch, and developer Vicarious Visions (the esteemed studio responsible for the superb remakes) was merged into Blizzard - a move that sadly meant a planned Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 + 4 ultimately never saw the light of day.

                              <span>The Talos Principle 2, Serious Sam studio Croteam&#x27;s follow-up to its acclaimed 2014 first-person puzzle adventure, will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 2nd November.


The original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving that played out something like Portal, albeit with a hell of a lot more lasers, a little bit of time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle &#x27;rooms&#x27; that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so on - to open gates, retrieve special Sigils, and progress.


As for The Talos Principle 2, it sounds like players can expect more of the same, and generally more all round. Croteam is promising new abilities, including gravity manipulation and mind transference, on top of the mechanics seen in the first game, and it&#x27;ll all take place across &quot;more than a dozen&quot; new environments - said to be hiding long-buried secrets and forgotten history - that range from a city on the brink of a paradigm shift to the landscapes of a mysterious island.

                              <span>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, the supernatural action-RPG from Life is Strange studio Don&#x27;t Nod, has been delayed to 13th February 2024 to avoid an &quot;intense release cycle for AAA titles&quot;.


Banishers unfolds in the frozen North American wilderness, in the year 1695, where ghost hunters (and lovers) Antea Duarte and Red mac Rait are working to protect the living from the spectral dead. Their situation becomes somewhat more complicated when Antea suddenly finds herself unexpectedly dead and also a ghost.


Don&#x27;t Nod and publisher Focus Entertainment had, as confirmed back in July, originally intended to release Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden on 7th November, but, in a short statement posted to Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s website today, Focus has now announced a three-month delay.

On Thursday, researchers from security firm Rezillion published evidence that they said made it “highly likely” both indeed stemmed from the same bug, specifically in libwebp, the code library that apps, operating systems, and other code libraries incorporate to process WebP images.
Rather than Apple, Google, and Citizen Lab coordinating and accurately reporting the common origin of the vulnerability, they chose to use a separate CVE designation, the researchers said. The researchers concluded that “millions of different applications” would remain vulnerable until they, too, incorporated the libwebp fix. That, in turn, they said, was preventing automated systems that developers use to track known vulnerabilities in their offerings from detecting a critical vulnerability that’s under active exploitation...</span>

                              <span>Two of the three games making up October&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Essential offerings have leaked ahead of an official announcement from Sony.
The information comes from reliable leaker Billbil-kun, who claims The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 will be added to the Essential tier of games for all PS Plus subscribers. 
The Callisto Protocol only came out in December last year, so this is a much cheaper way for those of you on PlayStation to play the game and try it out if you haven&#x27;t bought it yet.

                              <span>Resident Evil 4 Remake is heading to mobile, but it&#x27;ll cost players £57.99 to play in full.


The game&#x27;s listing on the App Store has the game available for free but with in-app purchases. Scrolling down, those purchases are listed in full with &quot;Resident Evil 4 (with bonus)&quot; priced at £57.99.


This is more expensive than as currently priced on Steam (£49.99) and PSN (£54.99), but similar to Xbox (£57.98). That&#x27;s practically unheard of for a mobile game.

&quot;Personally, I feel that game prices are too low,&quot; Tsujimoto said, citing increasing development costs and a need to increase wages.

This slither comes from Craig Mazin, showrunner and co-creator of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us  adaptation, who has said work on season two will resume &quot;the second&quot; that strike action is officially lifted.


As a reminder, the Writers Guild of America has been on strike for almost five months. However, it was recently announced that a tentative agreement has been reached between the relevant parties for a new three-year contract, something that looks set to end the 146-day strike (thanks, Variety).

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth producer Yoshinori Kitase and creative director Tetsuya Nomura have discussed the term JRPG, and shared contrasting opinions.


Nomura said he felt negatively towards the term, while Kitase was more accepting of its use to highlight the different approaches taken by Japanese game companies.


&quot;I&#x27;m not too keen on it,&quot; Nomura told The Guardian in a new interview. &quot;Certainly, when we started doing interviews for the games that I started making, no one used that term - they just called them RPGs. And then at some point - I can&#x27;t remember exactly when - people started referring to them as JRPGs. And I&#x27;m not really sure what the intent behind that is. It just always felt a bit off to me, and a bit weird. I never really understood it - or why it&#x27;s needed.&quot;

Yes, 2008. We&#x27;ve really been waiting a while.


This is the version of Beyond Good &amp; Evil we&#x27;ve seen in other clips released or leaked over the years, and which Ubisoft released an early trailer for (showing main character Jade and Uncle Pey&#x27;j in a car out in the desert).

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will task players with catching chocobo in real-time out in the wild.


Of course, catching chocobo is nothing new for the series, but a new social post on X (formerly Twitter) from the game&#x27;s official account shows how it&#x27;ll work in Rebirth for the first time, with a video of Cloud catching one of the iconic yellow birds. 


The method actually looks similar to Breath of the Wild, with Cloud sneaking through foliage (and some conveniently spiky yellow flowers) and throwing out some greens as a distraction before mounting the bird.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re jumping back into Cyberpunk 2077 with the release of Phantom Liberty today, be aware that it&#x27;s possible to lock yourself out of the DLC&#x27;s main quest.

As reported by PC Gamer, making a particular choice during one of the earlier story quests will lock you out of any future main quests. You can still explore Dogtown, but you won&#x27;t get to spend time with Idris Elba. Why would you deprive yourself of that opportunity?

The choice which will lock you out is towards the end of Lucretia My Reflection, the fourth main quest. It&#x27;s a fairly obvious one, but spoiler warning for below if you want to know exactly where it occurs.

                              <span>A Nintendo Switch version of Red Dead Redemption 2 has shown up on the Brazilian ratings board&#x27;s website.


As spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user necrolipe, Red Dead Redemption 2 has been rated for Nintendo Switch in Brazil. Eurogamer has since verified this listing, which also details other platforms the game is currently available on.


Developer Rockstar is yet to announce a Switch edition of its Wild West prequel, and it is unclear when the Brazilian ratings board updated its site to include this version. However, this recent revelation comes just one month after the studio added the first Red Dead game to the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s library.

                              <span>Members of the major SAG-AFTRA acting union have overwhelmingly voted in favour of authorising a potential video game strike.


Ballots were cast by 34,687 members, with 98.32 percent in favour of strike authorisation on the Interactive Media Agreement that covers union members&#x27; work on video games.


While this does not guarantee the union will call a strike, the next bargaining session is this week, and this ratchets up the pressure. The leverage of this authorisation could compel movement on either side.

That tiny nugget of information comes via a new Ask me Anything (AMA) Q&amp;A session, held earlier today on Reddit, in which Poncle occasionally had the opportunity to answer questions that weren&#x27;t variations on &#x27;Where the bloody hell are the vampires anyway, please?&#x27;.


One such question inquired if there were any multiplayer plans for Vampire Survivors beyond the four-player couch co-op mode introduced alongside the Switch release last month, to which Poncle replied in the affirmative.

This year&#x27;s The Last of Us Day (which, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, happens on 26th September to commemorate the in-game date the Cordyceps infection reached critical mass) coincides with the series&#x27; tenth anniversary, meaning some fans were hoping developer Naughty Dog might have a few extra-special reveals to mark the occasion. 


Unfortunately, in a tweet clearly intended to manage expectations ahead of time, Naughty Dog wrote, &quot;We&#x27;re celebrating with a The Last of Us Day stream tomorrow... featuring announcements focused on art, merch, and more. While we&#x27;re honouring the series&#x27; 10-year legacy, we will not be discussing any future game or TV show projects.&quot;

                              <span>Two weeks after getting its first small update, Starfield has just recieved another, this one focusing on performance and stability, as well as remedying a number of gameplay issues.


All-in-all, it&#x27;s not a particularly glamorous update, equating to a grand total of ten bullet points in Bethesda&#x27;s patch notes, but if you&#x27;ve been experiencing the likes of characters not appearing where they should be, blurry textures, or a hitch-y hand scanner, this one&#x27;s for you.


Full patch details can be found below, and for those wondering when Bethesda might have something more substantial to bring to Starfield, the developer says it&#x27;s &quot;continuing to work on [the] larger update&quot; that - as we learned a couple of weeks ago - will introduce the likes of Nvidia DLSS support and 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on PC, a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, and a new &quot;Eat&quot; button for food when it eventually arrives.

                              <span>Following a tumultuous week for Unity, in which the company infuriated a significant portion of the development community by making dramatic changes to its engine licensing terms - only to then partially walk them back - at least one developer has had enough, announcing it&#x27;ll no longer be porting its acclaimed game to Switch as a direct consequence of Unity&#x27;s actions.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced changes to its licensing agreement that would have forced developers to pay an additional fee every time a user installed their game. After significant outrage from the development community, with many accusing Unity of a betrayal of trust, the company changed course, saying its new pricing plan would now only apply to developers choosing to use its next Long Term Support version - but, as highlighted by developer Neognosis in a post announcing the cancellation of a Switch port for its acclaimed F-Zero-inspired racer BallisticNG, many developers might not have a choice but to upgrade.
 

&quot;Nintendo has a rolling Unity version requirement for game releases,&quot; the studio explained, &quot;and we&#x27;re already behind the threshold by two years. Two weeks ago this wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue... [but] by the time we&#x27;ll have a Switch version of BallisticNG ready, the threshold for Unity versions will exceed the new versions that Unity are pushing their TOS changes with, and we currently have no confidence that they won&#x27;t try pulling another move or pushing back to their original plans under/beyond this new TOS.&quot;

Onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, Meredith Whittaker, the president of the Signal Foundation, which maintains the nonprofit Signal messaging app, reaffirmed that Signal would leave the U.K. if the country’s recently passed Online Safety Bill forced Signal to build “backdoors” into its end-to-end encryption.
“We would leave the U.K. or any jurisdiction if it came down to the choice between backdooring our encryption and betraying the people who count on us for privacy, or leaving,” Whittaker said. “And that’s never not true.”...</span>

But how many of those have been suggested by Bethesda itself? And how often is it the studio actually encourages one of its games&#x27; bugs to be reintroduced?


Step up Bethesda level designer Zach Wilson, who revealed on X, formerly Twitter, that an early build of Starfield had its cute little hoover robots &quot;incorrectly flagged as human civilians&quot;.

At the Tokyo Game Show last week, Quantic Dream&#x27;s vice president of marketing Lisa Pendse was asked for an update on the game&#x27;s development.

                              <span>Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Saber Interactive are facing a class action lawsuit regarding the cancelled DLC for the Nintendo Switch port of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2.


The lawsuit was filed on 8th July, as spotted by The Gamer, by a singular plaintiff on behalf of himself and class members, defined as &quot;all persons in the State of California who purchased KOTOR for Nintendo during the relevant statute of limitations period, i.e. four years prior to the filing of the Complaint until present&quot;.


KOTOR 2 released on 8th June 2023 for Switch. It was initially advertised with plans to add a fan-made mod which restores content to the original game as DLC. On 3rd June 2023, Aspyr announced it was cancelling the Restored Content DLC and offered a &quot;complimentary&quot; key from a selection of other Star Wars games to those who had pre-purchased KOTOR 2.

                              <span>Video game creation platform Roblox has laid off 30 staff in the company&#x27;s talent acquisition team, as hiring slows.


The layoffs come following a period of dramatic growth for the game, which now commands 250 million monthly active users - more than Fortnite and Minecraft combined.


Reporting on the layoffs, Techcrunch said it believed the changes reflected a greater push within Roblox - which operates at a net loss - to focus in on its bottom line, which is heavily affected the growing sums it pays developers on its platform.

The collection includes the first three Metal Gear Solid games among other extras, and Konami has now released a table of the output resolution and frame rate for all three games across all platforms.


The first game, released on the original PlayStation, will be at 30fps across all platforms. The following two games will be at 60fps across PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC (Steam), but only 30fps on Switch (both handheld and docked).

The company also has no intention of acquiring companies itself, exec Haruhiro Tsujimoto has said.
Tsujimoto was asked by Bloomberg how Capcom would respond to an acquisition offer from Microsoft. &quot;I believe it would be better if we were equal partners,&quot; he replied.

                              <span>The arrival of Payday 3 has been plagued by server problems, leaving the game inaccessible at various times across its launch weekend.


Payday 3 was released on Thursday last week for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But as player numbers climbed, the game quickly got into problems. 


Now, in a statement issued this morning, the boss of Payday 3 developer Starbreeze said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; in how his company&#x27;s big new launch had landed - and largely pointed the finger at an unnamed third-party matchmaking service for causing the game to fall over.

                              <span>Destiny 2 players are continuing to experience difficulties this weekend, with some players reporting issues with redeeming bounties, unresponsive doors, and a bizarre issue that sees the usually combative foes decline to engage on the battlefield.

Despite recovering from persistent DDoS attacks that took down servers earlier this week, Destiny 2 is now experiencing a host of other errors and bugs, as well as possible further DDoS attacks that have players flocking to Bungie&#x27;s social media channels to report in-game oddities.

As spotted by PCGN, the issues are numerous and wide-reaching, affecting everything from PvP scores to broken doors to enemies failing to see Guardians, let alone engaging with them.

The kubeadm tool now supports etcd learner mode, which
allows you to enhance the resilience and stability
of your Kubernetes clusters by leveraging the learner mode
feature introduced in etcd version 3.4.
This guide will walk you through using etcd learner mode with kubeadm. By default, kubeadm runs
a local etcd instance on each control plane node.
In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate EtcdLearnerMode. With this feature gate enabled,
when joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and
promoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.
What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?
etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption
in Kubernetes clusters:

                              <span>Bandai Namco has just dropped story details for its third-person action game, Sand Land, based on Akira Toriyama&#x27;s manga from 2000.

Bandai Namco revealed the third-person action game back at Summer Games Fest, but this new trailer gives us a little more detail, including our first glimpse of a new original character. Check it out below:

&quot;Dive into a desert world where both humans and demons suffer from an extreme water shortage,&quot; teases Bandai Namco, as translated by Gematsu. &quot;Play as and watch the Fiend Prince, Beelzebub, Sheriff Rao and demon Thief set off on an adventure in search of a Legendary Spring hidden in the desert.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village is coming to Apple-flavoured smart devices just in time for Halloween on 30th October, 2023.

As spotted by the fine folks at Gematsu, whilst the action horror game is free to download and lets anyone try out the opening sequences for free, you&#x27;ll need ¥4990 – that&#x27;s around £27 – to unlock the full game, and another ¥2000 (£11) to experience the &quot;Winters&#x27; Expansion&quot; DLC. 

And yes, the Resident Evil 4 Remake iDevice port is also still on track, too, although Capcom will only commit to a vague &quot;2023&quot; release. Unlike the older Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 Remake will set you back ¥7990 (£44) and the newly-released DLC, Separate Ways, ¥1000 (£5.50). Again, you can download the game for free and give it a try before you buy.

                              <span>Upcoming augmented reality horror, Scrylight, will be a &quot;fully immersive, 360 degree ghost hunting experience&quot; that will not just turn your own home into a haunted house, but also interact with your real-life smart lights and doorbells, too.

With ghosts able to &quot;haunt players in real world scenarios, activating real world devices&quot;, developer Spectropia Studios utilises Niantic&#x27;s genre-defining AR technology to &quot;blur the boundaries of what&#x27;s real and what isn&#x27;t&quot;.

Features of the upcoming horror game include &quot;full 360 interaction between ghosts and players via your smart devices, camera and microphone for realistic entity interactions&quot;, infinite, &quot;geographical-specific&quot;, procedural entities, integrated machine learning agents and &quot;computer vision for real time interaction with your environment&quot;, and full smart device integration &quot;allowing for real world hauntings&quot;.

                              <span>Publisher Plaion marked the release of Payday 3 earlier this week by giving away &quot;a month&#x27;s average salary&quot; to one lucky Londoner.

Choosing London because it&#x27;s reportedly the city that struggles &quot;most with money management&quot;, Plaion set up a cross-city publicity stunt to put the local community to the test and have them follow the trail to a secret location where a &quot;specially-branded van&quot; hosted 2000 fake dollar bills. 

You can see highlights of the promotion in the video below:

&quot;We&#x27;re in the process of [making a third game] right now,&quot; Monaghan said during a panel (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>Team Cherry has quietly updated Steam assets for its highly-anticipated Hollow Knight sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong.

As spotted by Wario64 with the help of SteamDB, Hollow Knight: Silksong on Steam has had its first significant update since January 2023, with Team Cherry quietly swapping out a graphic for an updated version.

While it&#x27;s in no way indicative of an upcoming release date or anything like that – sorry – the changes to the storefront graphics are at least a sign that work is still underway behind the scenes, with the team twice uploading &quot;capsule art&quot; – that is, the artwork you see on the game&#x27;s storefront – in the last week, the most recent of which was uploaded earlier today.

Modder Dropoff recently showed off what happened when they imported Armored Core 6&#x27;s maps into From Software&#x27;s celebrated adventure game, giving players a whole new perspective on FromSoft&#x27;s latest game – literally.

But why read about it when you can see it for yourself? You can check out Dropoff&#x27;s handiwork in the video below:

                              <span>Supermassive Games&#x27; second instalment of the Dark Pictures Anthology, Little Hope, is coming to Nintendo Switch on 5th October 2023.

It follows Supermassive Games&#x27; efforts to bring the first The Dark Pictures Anthology title, Man of Medan, to Switch earlier this year, marking the second game of the horror series to come to Nintendo&#x27;s console.

Little Hope sees you follow a college class after the bus they were travelling in crashed in the middle of the night. As they explore the &quot;seemingly abandoned town&quot;, they become trapped by a &quot;mysterious impenetrable fog&quot; and begin to encounter visions of the townsfolk&#x27;s shocking history.

After a tweet purporting that CD Projekt had &quot;removed the Elon Musk cameo from the Corpo opening in Cyberpunk 2077&quot; went viral, senior quest designer Patrick Mills stepped in to ask, &quot;who came up with this nonsense?&quot;.

&quot;That wasn&#x27;t Elon musk, it looks nothing like him. Who came up with this nonsense?&quot; Mills asked.

After a three-day early access period for some players, Payday 3 released on 21st September, but players have struggled to get online at peak times due to continuing server issues that have shutdown matchmaking, making it impossible to play the always-online heist shooter.

On launch day, Starbreeze took to its social media accounts to admit that it was &quot;currently experiencing slow matchmaking&quot; and was &quot;investigating and working on a solution&quot;.

                              <span>Ten days after Unity successfully enraged huge swathes of the development community by announcing sweeping, and wildly unpopular, changes to its Unity Engine business model, the company has said it&#x27;s &quot;sorry&quot; and walked back on significant aspects of its new pricing plan.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced that, as of 1st January 2024, developers would be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install on top of their existing licence subscription after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash was immediate and intense, resulting in minor revisions to Unity&#x27;s initial plan.


Now though, Unity&#x27;s Marc Whitten has outlined significant changes to last week&#x27;s announcement in a post on the company&#x27;s website, beginning with another apology. &quot;I want to start with this: I am sorry,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new Runtime Fee policy. Our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow, and keep deeply investing in our game engine.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Total War: Pharaoh next month, on 11th October, there&#x27;s a bit of bad news - for some purchasers, at least: developer Creative Assembly has announced it&#x27;s delaying the title into &quot;early 2024&quot;, but only on the Epic Games Store.


It&#x27;s a bit of an unusual one this, but Creative Assembly says the situation has arisen because it was &quot;recently asked to help support the integration of social functions before we can launch on the Epic Games Store, and we&#x27;ll need additional time to help make that happen&quot;.


Importantly, though, Total War: Pharaoh&#x27;s 11th October release will remain unchanged on Steam - and all pre-orders made on Epic have been automatically cancelled, should you want to take your business elsewhere. Creative Assembly says all affected customers should receive an email confirming this cancellation directly from the Epic Games Store support team.

                              <span>Valve has once again dropkicked the dreams right out of anyone hoping a whizzier, more powerful Steam Deck might be happening soon; it&#x27;s now provided a clearer timeframe for what it considers to be the current Steam Deck&#x27;s minimum life span, saying not to expect any kind of performance upgrade &quot;in the next couple of years&quot;.


Valve has, of course, tempered expectations for a souped-up Steam Deck sequel previously; in December, Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais said the company would likely keep a single performance spec, ie. the current one, for its handheld gaming PC &quot;a little bit longer&quot;, noting any initial hardware improvements would probably focus on screen and battery capacity.


But now, speaking to The Verge, Griffais has indicated that &quot;little bit&quot; will likely be a lot longer, and that any Steam Deck performance upgrades are still some considerable way off. &quot;It&#x27;s important to us that the Deck offers a fixed performance target for developers,&quot; he explained, &quot;and that the message to customers is simple, where every Deck can play the same games.&quot;

                              <span>If you cast your minds back to 2020, you may recall Spider-Man being a hot topic of conversation. This was not because he had just used his web-tastic athleticism to save a school bus of children from careering off the side of the road, or swept MJ off her feet (literally) before kissing her while upside down. 


Rather, he was a topic of conversation because Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games remastered its original 2018 game for the PlayStation 5, and at the same time changed up the look of its unmasked hero, Peter Parker. 


While Insomniac said this new model was a better reflection of actor Yuri Lowenthal&#x27;s facial capture, it caused a certain amount of upset for fans of the original. In fact, when the PC version of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man released last year, mods were made to bring Peter Parker&#x27;s original face back into the game. But, perhaps we should all be less concerned about the two different facial models for Peter and move on. After all, that&#x27;s what his actor wants. In fact, he just wants people to &quot;get over it&quot;.

                              <span>The third major patch for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is now being rolled out, and it includes the long-awaited Magic Mirror feature.
Players can now change their character&#x27;s appearance by finding the Magic Mirror in camp. Everything other than race and subrace of your character can be altered - though it also can&#x27;t be used to get rid of any &quot;cosmetic modifications that are a consequence of your gameplay choices&quot;. Also, origin characters, hirelings and full illithids can&#x27;t use the Magic Mirror.
Patch three has also added full support for the game on Mac, with Larian Studios recommending any players on Mac remove any mods and reinstall the game fresh before playing.

                              <span>Honkai Impact 3rd is getting a Part 2, with a new combat system and story that leaves previous protagonist Kiana behind.
Scheduled to release in February 2024, Part 2 will debut its new storyline on Mars, a new location for Impact 3rd, which previously contained its galactic adventures on Earth and its moon. Previously thought uninhabitable in Honkai lore, Mars actually offers a &quot;unique civilization and nature&quot;  where &quot;there may also be mysteries hidden behind the daily lives of residents that have yet to be discovered&quot;.
In addition to expanding its reach further into the solar system, Part 2 debuts a cast of &quot;new partners from different cultures&quot;, introducing brand new main characters and NPCs alongside our shiny new playable character, a Martian native team supporter named Dreamseeker.

A number of crossovers with other franchises are always to be expected, and this Season players will be able to purchase some horror (and horror adjacent) icons as Operators. 
Diablo&#x27;s Lilith and Inarius (everybody&#x27;s favourite Mother and Father from hell), He-Man nemesis Skeletor, Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, and Alucard from the manga series Hellsing will all be entering the fray.

                              <span>Lego has announced another Super Mario set - this time, a shelf-sized model of a Piranha Plant.


Measuring 23cm high by 11cm wide, the 540-piece design will launch in the UK on 6th November, at the comparatively affordable (for Lego) price of £58.


This is another of Lego&#x27;s Super Mario range for older fans (albeit those still young at heart), rather than its kid-focused line of Super Mario sets which interact with its electronic Super Mario, Luigi and Peach toys.

On 29th September, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror will be available to play via the Game Boy Advance emulation service. You&#x27;ll need a Switch Online subscription and the Expansion Pack to access it.
Kirby and the Amazing Mirror was released in 2004 for GBA and it tells the story of Kirby, who accidentally gets split into four different Kirbys, as he saves the Mirror World from dark corruption. The original release supported local multiplayer via Game Link Cable.

                              <span>A cosy new hobbit-based Lord of the Rings spinoff game has been teased by Wētā Workshop and Private Division. Yes, it is actually happening.


Tales of the Shire was announced to celebrate Hobbit Day, and promises to provide a snuggly &quot;heart-warming&quot; experience set in Tolkein&#x27;s Middle-earth universe. It&#x27;s coming from Wētā Workshop and Private Division and will arrive sometime next year. Needless to say, I am more than a little bit excited.


To accompany this announcement, a small teaser was also released. It is short and suitably charming, showing a young person humming as she sits at a table strewn with flora and art supplies. There are also modern bits and pieces, such as headphones. She is painting in a book, and while I have nothing to base this on other than my hunch, she looks to be painting herself as a hobbit. Could this be Tales of the Shire&#x27;s soon to be pint-sized protagonist?

                              <span>In a positive development for Microsoft, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has &quot;provisionally concluded&quot; the company&#x27;s revised deal to purchase Activision Blizzard will be enough to grant approval.


Back in April, the CMA made the shock decision to block Microsoft&#x27;s proposed deal to acquire the Call of Duty maker. At this time, the regulatory body cited concerns relating to the cloud gaming sector, stating that the deal risked &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;.


In August, Microsoft submitted a revised proposal in a bid to appease the regulator, saying it would now sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be accepted.

                              <span>Ubisoft sure does love a sequel, and it&#x27;s now confirmed - in just about as understated a fashion as is possible - that it&#x27;s got another one in the works, this time in the form of The Division 3.


News of The Division 3&#x27;s existence comes not via a flashy announcement trailer or Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot bellowing the news through a megaphone while sat astride a glitter cannon, but instead tucked away in a press release announcing something else entirely.


Specifically, Ubisoft today disseminated a press release among news outlets announcing that Julian Gerighty - the creative director of next year&#x27;s eagerly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws - has been appointed new executive producer of its Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division brand.

                              <span>Seeing everything there is to see in developer Larian Studios&#x27; ludicrously vast Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is already something of an impossible task, but Astarion actor Neil Newbon has now raised the stakes even higher, claiming it features a two-hour secret section that no-one&#x27;s yet found.


During one of Newbon&#x27;s regular Twitch livestreams, aired at the end of last month (thanks GamesRadar), the voice of everyone&#x27;s favourite perfectly coiffured glampire teased that, &quot;There&#x27;s even something I know about that you can&#x27;t get to unless you do something that I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s going to work out&quot;.


Sadly, Newbon - who was told about the mysterious &quot;two hours of content&quot; in confidence and is likely &quot;one of the few people that knows about it&quot; - wouldn&#x27;t even offer a &quot;vague clue or hint&quot; when asked. He did, however, tease that &quot;at some point, somebody will find it for a very specific reason&quot; - so it seems like getting to the bottom of this one will be squarely in the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 community&#x27;s court.

                              <span>As part of its Tokyo Game Showcase, Capcom has shared nine minutes of new Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 gameplay footage, this time focusing on vocations - basically the series&#x27; version of classes - as well as offering a little look at some of the major locations in its world.


At the game&#x27;s outset, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma provides a choice between four vocations - fighter, mage, thief, and archer - each determining a player&#x27;s style of play, but more will become available as events progress - and vocations can be changed by visiting Vocation Guilds, should you want to mix things up.


The fighter, for instance, specialises in one-handed sword and shield combat for short-range attacks and defensive manoeuvring. The archer, meanwhile, is better suited to taking down enemies - which are said to be behave organically out the world - from a distance using their bow and arrow, which can support the likes of exploding and blighting arrows.

Season 10 itself gets underway on 19th October, and will introduce a major new feature each month ahead of 2024 - essentially meaning all content originally planned for 2023 will arrive before the end of the year, despite a painfully protracted, seven-month-long Season 9.


First up, on 19th October, Sea of Thieves will introduce Guilds, described as a &quot;new way for players to form meaningful bonds beyond their immediate crew&quot;. Essentially, any player that&#x27;s reached Captain status and has their own ship can start a guild - picking a name, logo, and emblem when then do so - which can then support up to 24 invited players.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Now, the latest free-to-play Pokémon Go-style augmented reality creature-battler from developer Niantic, made in collaboration with Capcom, has officially surpassed 5m downloads in its first week of release on iOS and Android.


Monster Hunter Now, which was announced back in February and got its full launch on 21st September following a series of closed beta tests, employs a similar real-world exploration and interaction system to the ones seen in the likes of Niantic&#x27;s Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom, albeit with an obvious Monster Hunter twist.


Here, players are able to gather useful resources and fight monsters they encounter while out on their real-world travels - including the Barroth, Tobi Kadachi, Jyuratodus, Paolumu, Anjanath, Rathian, Rathalos, and Diablos - then combine their spoils to create better equipment that&#x27;ll enable them to take on tougher challenges.

This closed alpha will be accessible to players who sign up for an account at Everywhere.game.


A new trailer for Everywhere, released today, shows some of the biomes you can explore and play around with in the game, as well as some swooping camera pans through its Ready Player One-style hub. There&#x27;s also a glimpse at some of the types of mini-games you can build and a brief look at the game&#x27;s editor mode, which lets you tweak creations you&#x27;ve made on the fly.

Yes, as Valve gently reminds us in its announcement post (even if I wish it didn&#x27;t), &quot;2024 isn&#x27;t exactly that far away&quot;, so the dates for its upcoming sales have been published to allow developers to prepare their applications for inclusion in the relevant events. 
Confirmed sale dates include the usual Spring Sale, the next edition of Steam Next Fest, and a number of themed events.

                              <span>As part of this morning&#x27;s Xbox Digital Broadcast at Tokyo Game Show, we got our first look at Hotel Barcelona. 


This upcoming release is a time-looping action game from Hidetaka &quot;Swery&quot; Suehiro and Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda, two legends of game development. It promises to serve us all up some &quot;2.5D slasher film parodic action&quot;.


So, what&#x27;s it actually all about? Well, Hotel Barcelona is where America&#x27;s serial killers have all decided to reconvene. And, according to the official trailer blurb, players will need to defeat this murderous bunch and &quot;check out before all the blood is spilled&quot;.

                              <span>Party Animals, previously one of the most wishlisted games on Steam, has come under fire since its release earlier this week, with scores of players calling out developer Recreate Games for what they say was false advertising. 


This all stems from the game&#x27;s description of its offline (and online) multiplayer, which originally read: &quot;Paw it out with your friends both online and offline&quot;.


But Party Animals does not have an offline mode. As a result, many owners have left negative comments about the release.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Microsoft was party to a monumental set of leaks that detailed everything from console plans to video game roadmaps. It also revealed email exchanges between Microsoft&#x27;s execs, where Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond and others discussed potential games for the company&#x27;s Game Pass subscription service. 


One such game was Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, the recent hit from developer Larian. As we previously reported, Microsoft estimated it would take $5m to get Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 on Game Pass, with the company dubbing the game a &quot;second-run Stadia PC RPG&quot;.


Needless to say, given the huge success of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Microsoft underestimated its potential. But Larian isn&#x27;t mad about this. Rather, it has said it understands the situation, with the studio&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse saying it &quot;comes with the genre&quot;.

Square Enix&#x27;s closer relationship with Xbox continues with the launch of Octopath Traveler 2 on Xbox in early 2024, following its launch for PC, PlayStation and Switch in February. 


Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name and Like a Dragon: Ishin! will both be coming to Xbox Game Pass, with the former joining on its day of release on 9th November, and the latter coming sometime &quot;this year&quot;.

The game has already come under fire for a range of technical and graphical issues, with some fans calling its $70  price point &quot;a robbery&quot;. 
It&#x27;s now receiving more criticism thanks to the official trailer posted on Nintendo of America&#x27;s YouTube channel, which seemingly includes PC gameplay to advertise the Switch version of the game.

A description of the game&#x27;s most violent moments has now been published by the ESRB, the US ratings board, which has given Modern Warfare 3 an M rating for Mature. 


&quot;A handful of sequences depict more intense acts of violence,&quot; the ESRB writes, including a mission which includes &quot;terrorists (dressed as police officers and paramedics) shooting/killing fleeing civilians inside a stadium concourse&quot;.

                              <span>After two rip-roaring outings, Sea of Thieves&#x27; wonderful Monkey Island adventure will soon reach its end; Rare has now confirmed its third and final instalment will launch next Thursday, 28th September - clearing the way for the pirate game&#x27;s tenth season on 19th October.


Sea of Thieves&#x27; three-part The Legend of Monkey Island adventure got underway back in July, sending players on a quest to Mêlée Island where, thanks to the mysterious power of the Sea of the Damned, Guybrush Threepwood had become the mightiest pirate of all. It was a wonderful opening episode, managing to capture the magic (if perhaps not the humour) of the point-and-click classic, and things only got better in last month&#x27;s vastly more open-ended part two.


Episode three, titled The Lair of LeChuck, whisks players away to an absolutely gorgeous rendition of Monkey Island itself - which you can see a bit of at the 4:49 mark in Sea of Thieves&#x27; latest news update below - spanning everything from dense jungle to lava-filled catacombs.

                              <span>Glen Schofield, the co-creator of Dead Space, is departing his Striking Distance Studios following the commercial failure of its first game, sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol. 


Schofield founded Striking Distance Studios in 2019, under the wing of a Korean publisher Krafton Inc., which was looking to create a narrative-based game that would expand its PUBG: Battlegrounds universe - although, notably, all connections to PUBG had been excised by the time The Callisto Protocol launched in December last year.


Unfortunately, The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s critical reception was mixed and the game was met with lower-than-anticipated sales. In January, it was reported that Krafton had expected to shift five million copies of The Callisto Protocol - whose three-year development had cost it £132m - but that it was unlikely to hit its target, given just two million copies had been sold at the time.

Senior brand manager Nicholas Edwards announced his departure from Crystal Dynamics in a message shared on LinkedIn, revealing he was &quot;one of a number of people impacted by the latest round of Embracer layoffs&quot; at the studio. Edwards noted today&#x27;s job cuts had affected a broad spread of departments, including PR, project management, 2D art, and video editing.


Crystal Dynamics&#x27; communications director Adam Kahn also confirmed he&#x27;d been affected by today&#x27;s layoffs, as did senior community and social media manager Neha Nair. &quot;After 3.5 years at Crystal Dynamics,&quot; Nair wrote, &quot;I was laid off today.&quot;

                              <span>Following the surprise news that Paradox Interactive&#x27;s beleaguered Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is now in the hands of  Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs studio The Chinese Room, the developer has talked a little about its goals for the rejuvenated project, saying it&#x27;s building its action around &#x27;doing things only a vampire can&#x27;.


Bloodlines 2 has, of course, had a tumultuous journey since its unveiling back in 2019; original developer Hardsuit Labs was ditched following a number of controversies, almost resulting in the cancellation of the game, but Paradox eventually confirmed development had been handed to a new studio, now known to be The Chinese Room, sometime in 2021.


Bloodlines 2&#x27;s re-reveal earlier this month was fairly light on detail, but Paradox did say the game would cast players as an Elder vampire in the &quot;dark underbelly of Seattle, where vampires struggle for survival and supremacy&quot;. It also confirmed there&#x27;d be characters for players to chat with, combat, a need to keep a low profile to ensure vampire society stays hidden from humanity, and &quot;complex political relationships&quot;.

I recently published an essay about my experiences ten years ago.</span>

                              <span>UK regulatory body the Competition and Markets Authority is reportedly preparing to share its preliminary judgement on Microsoft&#x27;s revised Activision Blizzard deal next week.


The CMA is, of course, Microsoft&#x27;s last remaining hurdle in getting its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard over the finish line after the UK regulator made the shock decision to block the deal in April, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;. 


Following the CMA&#x27;s decision - and the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s failure to secure a temporary halt on the deal in a US court - Microsoft returned to the UK regulator with a revised proposal, saying it would sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be approved.

                              <span>Criterion, the British studio behind recent Need for Speed titles and the classic Burnout series, will now focus the majority of its efforts on EA&#x27;s Battlefield shooter franchise.


A smaller &quot;core group&quot; within Criterion will continue on with Need for Speed, meanwhile.


Criterion has of course worked on Battlefield before, and contributed bits to DICE&#x27;s Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 (it also helped out on Star Wars Battlefront 2). The talented team will now turn its efforts back to improving 2042, and to the future of the Battlefield franchise overall.

The adaptation was revealed a year ago byCapcom, along with a few stills from the show. Its protagonist is Musashi Miyamoto, whose likeness is modelled after prolific Japanese actor Mifune Toshiro (best known for his roles in Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s films including Seven Samurai). The series is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer, 13 Assassins).

The new trailer shows snippets of action sequences and reveals hints of the plot. Netflix describes the first episode as &quot;the beginning of an intense series full of realistic action in which Musashi&#x27;s blade slices through evil as he traverses a land plagued by poverty&quot;.

                              <span>When Yakuza: Like a Dragon released in 2020, there was an odd situation where the PS5 version released four months after the Xbox Series X/S version, with no explanations given.
Thanks to the huge leak of documents accidentally uploaded by Microsoft to the US FTC, we now know why the PS5 version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon was released later than its Xbox next-gen counterparts. 
In a series of emails dated 1st June 2020, Xbox execs Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond, and Damon Baker (who has since left Microsoft and joined publisher Kepler Interactive) discuss how the company essentially ended up with a timed exclusive on next-gen consoles thanks to a number of caveats with certain deals struck between itself, Sega and Sony.

RGG has also released a story trailer which sets up the events of Infinite Wealth. Protagonist Ichiban Kasuga is sent to Hawaii to look for his long lost mother, Akane. Once he arrives, he ends up being ambushed as many local factions are also searching for Akane. 
Series poster boy Kazuma Kiryu has also been sent to find Akane by the Daidoji faction, and he teams up with Ichiban to fully dismantle the Yakuza in Japan.

                              <span>Terraria developer Re-Logic is donating $100k to two open source engines in the wake of Unity&#x27;s recent policy changes.


Re-Logic does not even use Unity, but in a statement via X (formerly Twitter) the developer said it felt it &quot;cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere&quot;.


Godot and FNA will receive $100k each, and Re-Logic will also continue sponsoring both with a further $1k per month. &quot;All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere,&quot; said Re-Logic.

You&#x27;ll need just 40GB of storage to install Mirage, with a variety of CPUs and GPUs supported for running the game somewhere between 1080p 30fps and up to 4K and 60fps.


On the low end, you&#x27;re looking at a Nvidia GeForce 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 570 with 8GB RAM. On the high end, you&#x27;ll need a Nvidia GeForce 3080 or AMD Radeon 6900 with 16GB RAM.

Bluey the cartoon follows the adventures of the eponymous Blue Heeler dog, her sister Bingo, mum Chilli, and dad Bandit. All are along for the ride in Bluey: The Videogame, which promises an &quot;interactive sandbox adventure&quot; for up to four players, featuring fully explorable recreations of some of the show&#x27;s most recognisable locations.


There&#x27;s talk of &quot;story-driven episodic gameplay&quot;, split into four parts, that&#x27;ll include activities and mini-games inspired by the cartoon - Keepy Uppy and Magic Xylophone are mentioned - with players able to unlock new costumes, stickers, episodes, and locations as they go.

                              <span>Saber Interactive has announced it&#x27;s ending development of last year&#x27;s Evil Dead: The Game - meaning no new content will be produced and the planned Switch version is now cancelled.


Evil Dead: The Game - which launched onto Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last May - is another entry in the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre that&#x27;s already bought us the likes of Dead by Daylight and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this one pitting a cast of familiar faces from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell&#x27;s Ash Williams, against the Deadite hordes.


Since its release, sporadic post-launch support has introduced a castle map inspired by Army of Darkness, new outfits, a number of characters, the new Plaguebringer class, and a new Splatter Royale mode. April saw the previously Epic Games Store-exclusive title make the jump to Steam on PC, but content updates fizzled out after that - and now Saber Interactive has confirmed development has reached its end.

                              <span>UPDATE 20/9/23: Following the release of Xbox boss Phil Spencer&#x27;s public statement on social media addressing recent leaks, The Verge has obtained a copy of a more substantial internal memo circulated among Microsoft employees:


&quot;Today, several documents submitted in the court proceedings related to our proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard were unintentionally disclosed. I know this is disappointing, even if many of the documents are well over a year old and our plans have evolved.


&quot;I also know we all take the confidentiality of our plans and our partners’ information very seriously. This leak obviously is not us living up to that expectation. We will learn from what happened and be better going forward. We all put incredible amounts of passion and energy into our work, and this is never how we want that hard work to be shared with the community. That said, there’s so much more to be excited about, and when we’re ready, we’ll share the real plans with our players.

                              <span>Following today&#x27;s mega-sized Xbox leak - which has given us word of a planned digital-only Xbox Series X/S refresh and new controller, a tantalising Bethesda release roadmap, first details of a brand-new Xbox in 2028, confirmation Xbox boss Phil Spencer is awfully keen to buy Nintendo, and more - the US Federal Trade Commission has stepped forward to quell any bubbling conspiracy theories and emphatically state it was not responsible (it was Microsoft).


Today&#x27;s barrage of Xbox news all came from confidential Xbox documents, dated April 2022, that were originally shared by Microsoft as part of the FTC&#x27;s case against the company&#x27;s proposed $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. These documents then surfaced publicly last night, providing access to a treasure trove of fully unredacted internal details.


Predictably, internet conspiracy theories have ebbed and flowed throughout to the day regarding who might be have been responsible for the leak and why - but the FTC has moved to make it abundantly clear it wasn&#x27;t involved, begining with a statement from Douglas Farrar, the commission&#x27;s office of public affairs director, on social media.

                              <span>In April, Cybersecurity Ventures reported on extreme cybersecurity job shortage:
Global cybersecurity job vacancies grew by 350 percent, from one million openings in 2013 to 3.5 million in 2021, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The number of unfilled jobs leveled off in 2022, and remains at 3.5 million in 2023, with more than 750,000 of those positions in the U.S. Industry efforts to source new talent and tackle burnout continues, but we predict that the disparity between demand and supply will remain through at least 2025.

                              <span>Tekken 8&#x27;s Closed Network Tests are regrettably no more (regrettable if you too find unintended joy in unfortunately selected acronyms), as Bandai Namco has announced it&#x27;ll be launching the fighter&#x27;s first Closed Beta Test this October. 


So while we must sadly bid a fond farewell to the publisher&#x27;s eye-catching Tekken 8 CNT graphic, we do at least get to snicker at its replacement (I&#x27;m assuming nobody at Bandai Namco thought to run &#x27;CBT&#x27; through the internet first either) when the next bout of testing gets underway at 8am BST on 20th October. Proceedings will run until 9am on 23rd October, with three hours of downtime scheduled between 9am and 12pm on the 21st.


Once again, players across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Steam can get involved (Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus subscriptions are not required), and once again places are limited, so those interested in participating will need to register their interest beforehand. Registration closes at 8am on 11th October and successful applicants will be notified starting at 8am on the 18th. Additionally, Bandai Namco notes successful CNT entrants can play without re-registering.

                              <span>Xbox has announced the next wave of games to join the Game Pass library.
The second half of September is chock full of games available on day one with Game Pass, including Soulslike Lies of P which is already out on cloud, console and PC. We gave it three out of five stars in our review, Caelyn Ellis called it &quot;an enjoyable experience for those in need of a FromSoft fix&quot;.
Tomorrow, multiplayer party game Party Animals joins Game Pass on day one on cloud and console. I had a blast playing Party Animals with Ed and Victoria for a preview a few months back. It&#x27;s difficult to not enjoy a game with cute animals, floppy physics, and oversized weapons.

                              <span>The recent leak of internal Microsoft documents gives an indication as to what the company expects to pay to get games on Xbox Game Pass.


For instance, Microsoft estimated it would take $300m to get Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on Game Pass, or $250m for either Mortal Kombat 1 or Suicide Squad.


As we reported earlier today, a 2022 email thread initiated by Phil Spencer had Microsoft scrambling to fill the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield&#x27;s delay and included a long list of potential third-party games.

The feature was confirmed by associate animation director James Ham in an interview with Gamertag Radio.
The ability to switch between Peter and Miles is a new addition for this sequel and switching characters will be &quot;almost&quot; instantaneous. But what happens to the other character that you&#x27;re not controlling in the open world?

                              <span>French President Emmanuel Macron has clarified his view on video games after previously blaming recent riots on the culture of video games.


Now, in a new statement on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said he startled gamers - or, he literally &quot;made the gamers jump&quot; - with his words and that really he &quot;always considered that video games are an opportunity for France, for our youth and its future, for our jobs and our economy&quot;.


He continued: &quot;I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks. It is this violence that I condemn, not video games.

                              <span>Nintendo is set to update F-Zero 99 with more courses and modes in the near future.


First up, Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese web page for the game states that two sets of courses will be added. The first will be in late September and taken from the Queen League; the second will be mid-October and from the King League.



At present, the courses in the game are mainly taken from the Knight League, so expect some trickier races in the near future.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing what feels like the biggest leak of Xbox gaming news in history, which has left Microsoft&#x27;s plans to launch new hardware in 2024 and a new console generation in 2028 exposed. 
Next year&#x27;s redesigned Xbox Series X is digital only, according to documents from 2022 that Microsoft presented to the FTC this year. It does not appear to boast a bump in processing power - something that gels with what Xbox boss Phil Spencer told me at Gamescom last month - but also ditches the ability to play older games on disc. How does that square with Microsoft&#x27;s push for game preservation?
Looking further ahead, Microsoft has pinned 2028 as the year we&#x27;ll finally see the Xbox Series X&#x27;s proper successor arrive. Is that too late? And what does it mean that the console will support &quot;cloud hybrid&quot; games?

                              <span>You know the drill. Classified military documents get posted onto the War Thunder forum, until it&#x27;s noticed by a moderator who deletes it. In a surprise to nobody, it happened yet again last week.
The document shared this time was a flight manual for the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, Niche Gamer reported. Information such as sensor locations, firing angles, and engine specifications were shown on the pages circulated on the thread.
The entire thread has since been deleted, though developer Gaijin Entertainment confirmed the information had been posted onto its forum.

                              <span>Phil Spencer admitted the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield&#x27;s delay was a &quot;disaster situation&quot; and suggested FromSoftware&#x27;s Dark Souls games to plug the gap following the success of Elden Ring, among other third-party releases.


Today&#x27;s enormous leak of internal Microsoft documents includes a particularly candid email from Spencer sent in May 2022, revealing his frustration around &quot;a huge hole with our games lineup&quot;. That was due to Starfield&#x27;s delay, &quot;not a tonne of clarity on the launch date of Redfall&quot;, and Stalker 2 development impacted by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.


&quot;We keep talking about a big AAA a quarter in the service [Game Pass] and it feels like we are likely to go through a gap of almost 16 months between big exclusive launches on our platform,&quot; Spencer lamented.

Larian noted last night that &quot;some PS5 players&quot; were &quot;experiencing sudden Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 crashes in what appears to be a PSN-related issue&quot;.


&quot;We&#x27;re investigating the problem,&quot; Larian continued, via a post on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;But for now, the workaround is to disconnet your PS5 from the internet.&quot;

                              <span>Shadows of Doubt, the ambitious procedural detective noir sandbox from developer Cole Jefferies, is introducing new cases themed around infidelity on 25th September, as part of its first major update since entering Steam early access in April.


Shadows of Doubt, for those in need of a quick refresher, is a first-person, open-world detective sim set in a noirish sci-fi city. Its unique selling point, however, is that procedural generation governs virtually every aspect of it in a bid to create an endlessly replayable crime-solving caper - from the layout of its city streets to the schedules of its citizens, right through to the cases you&#x27;ll need to solve through stealth, subtrefuge, and sleuthing.


And from next Monday, 25th September, come the arrival of its Cheats and Liars update, Shadows of Doubt will have another trick in its toolbox - as players might just find themselves asked to investigate cases of infidelity, should it suit the procedural generation&#x27;s whims.

                              <span>Phil Spencer described Nintendo as &quot;THE prime asset&quot; in a leaked internal email concerning possible Microsoft acquisitions.


The email chain, sent in 2020 between Spencer, chief marketing officer Chris Capossela, and commercial chief marketing officer Takeshi Numoto, discusses the possibility of acquiring Nintendo at some point in the future, with Numoto initially noting Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;rich set of franchises&quot;.


&quot;I totally agree that Nintendo is THE prime asset for us in gaming and today gaming is our most likely path to consumer relevance,&quot; replied Spencer.

Sebile will also be available in the Xbox Design Lab, allowing buyers to customise the colours on the controller, with special and limited editions expected down the line.

                              <span>As part of the recent Microsoft leaks, a slate of Bethesda games - including several unannounced titles -  have been revealed. 


This sizable list was part of an internal Microsoft document from July 2020, which was issued ahead of the company&#x27;s acquisition of Bethesda. 


Along with games such as this year&#x27;s Starfield and Redfall, the list also includes titles up until the end of 2024&#x27;s financial year.

                              <span>A cascade of confidential Microsoft documents leaked overnight, detailing the company&#x27;s Xbox plans for the coming years. 


Along with emails detailing the likes of a potential eye on acquiring Nintendo and a Series X/S refresh for 2024, the leak also revealed Microsoft&#x27;s plans to release a new next-generation console in 2028.


The leaked slides, as seen below, show Microsoft has its next-gen console planned for in five years time. It will support &quot;cloud hybrid games&quot;, and is currently described as an &quot;immersive game and app platform&quot;.

The company&#x27;s mid-gen refresh is slated to arrive in 2024, four years before plans for a proper next-gen Xbox console expected in 2028.


Next year&#x27;s new Xbox Series X (codenamed &quot;Brooklin&quot;) will be all-digital and sports a new cyclindrical design. It&#x27;s set for launch next October.

                              <span>The Sims 4&#x27;s first Stuff Pack in two-and-a-half years - Home Chef Hustle - has been given a release date, and will be introducing some hardcore small appliance action to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC from next Thursday, 28th September.


The Home Chef Hustle Stuff Pack essentially features four components: there&#x27;s new kitchen decor, new cooking attire, new small appliances, plus the ability to cart all your culinary creations out into the street to sell at a food stall and make some Simoleons along the way.


In terms of decor, you get counters, cabinets, and matching home appliances (oven, fridge, and dishwasher to be specific), all taking a cue from European designs, while the new small appliances come in the form of a Stand Mixer, Waffle Maker, and Countertop Pizza Oven - the latter also capable of cooking focaccia bread if pizza isn&#x27;t your thing.

                              <span>A week after Unity announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model - drawing immediate and widespread condemnation from the development community - the company has reportedly told staff it&#x27;ll be making adjustments to the controversial new pricing plan.


As reported by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Unity leadership addressed employees in an all-hands meeting held earlier today (a meeting originally planned for late last week was cancelled following a &quot;potential threat&quot; from an employee), saying the company was &quot;considering&quot; introducing a cap on its hugely unpopular new per-install fees.


Unity initially caused an outcry last Tuesday, when it told developers that, on top of their existing Unity Engine licence subscription, they&#x27;d be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee each time a user installed their game, starting on 1st January 2024. This would apply to all games, including those already on the market, that had made $200k USD or more in the last 12 months and had at least 200k lifetime game installs.

                              <span>In news that isn&#x27;t likely to be much of a surprise to anyone at this point, a newly unearthed Microsoft court document has confirmed The Elder Scrolls 6 won&#x27;t be making its way to PlayStation when it eventually shows up in 2026 or beyond.


Microsoft submitted the document (thanks The Verge) as part of its court battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard - the same court proceedings that saw Xbox boss Phil Spencer answer an FTC attorney&#x27;s questions about The Elder Scrolls 6&#x27;s Xbox exclusivity by saying, &quot;I think we&#x27;ve been a little unclear on what platforms it&#x27;s launching on, given how far out the game is. It&#x27;s difficult for us right now to nail down... It&#x27;s so far out it&#x27;s hard to understand what the platforms will even be at this point.&quot;


Despite Spencer&#x27;s noncommital answer back in June, Microsoft&#x27;s newly released court documents make it explicitly clear The Elder Scrolls 6 won&#x27;t be coming to a PlayStation console.

Do AI detectors work?
In short, no. While some (including OpenAI) have released tools that purport to detect AI-generated content, none of these have proven to reliably distinguish between AI-generated and human-generated content.
Additionally, ChatGPT has no “knowledge” of what content could be AI-generated. It will sometimes make up responses to questions like “did you write this [essay]?” or “could this have been written by AI?” These responses are random and have no basis in fact.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick was briefed by Nintendo on Switch 2 in December last year. 


Emails between Activision executives - made public as part of the FTC&#x27;s court case with Microsoft and published today by The Verge, albeit with many redactions - show that the company&#x27;s controversial boss Bobby Kotick spoke with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa about Switch 2 at the end of 2022.


Activision exec Chris Schnakenberg noted that the console was expected to be weigh in with a &quot;closer alignment to Gen 8 platforms in terms of performance&quot;, referring to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles.

                              <span>It&#x27;s quite hard to believe it, but yes - yesterday marked 10 years since GTA 5 first released on PS3 and Xbox 360. 


It&#x27;s undoubtedly become a milestone of recent gaming history, driven by an impressive figure of over 160m lifetime sales, critical reception, and endless controversies from developer Rockstar Games and its parent company Take-Two. The popular multiplayer mode, GTA Online, continues to stand the test of time as Rockstar continually adds new updates and content. 


As Rockstar works on GTA 6 and Take-Two suggests it might be released as early as next year, now feels like an appropriate moment to take stock of the achievements, missteps, and musings that surround GTA 5.

In an interview with IGN, Insomniac&#x27;s director of core technology Mike Fitzgerald and project director Jeannette Lee shared more about the studio&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive. 


The developers said the game was the &quot;culmination of everything [Insomniac has] learned&quot; about developing for PlayStation 5.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 released in early access last week across Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Since then, several users have uploaded footage and screenshots showcasing the Switch version of the game - and the results aren&#x27;t great. 


In fact, the version available on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console has been widely panned, with many wondering how the developer can ask the same price on Switch as on other platforms. 


Fans have taken to the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok to question NetherRealm&#x27;s decision to market Mortal Kombat 1 as a $70 Switch release. It has been called &quot;robbery&quot; and &quot;disrespectful&quot; to users.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Avengers has been heavily discounted as support ends ahead of full delisting.


It&#x27;s now available on Steam with a 90 percent discount for just £2.99. Similarly, on PSN and Xbox it&#x27;s £4.49.


Back in January, Crystal Dynamics announced that support for the live-service game would end on 30th September this year and will no longer be available to purchase after this date. Its final update was at the end of March.

                              <span>Unity has apologised following the furore around its disastrous plans to charge developers when people download games made using its technology.


The plans prompted an enormous backlash from developers across the industry, and threw up a multitude of questions around how the new policy would work in practice - answers which Unity belatedly scrambled to work out itself.


This morning, Unity said it was sorry for the &quot;confusion and angst&quot; its changes had caused, and promised it would make unspecified &quot;changes&quot; to its plans.

                              <span>Respawn seems to have quietly patched Titanfall 2.

Back in 2021, Respawn sought to reassure concerned Titanfall 2 players after reports of a security vulnerability caused some to uninstall the game. 

For a long time, however, very little was done for Titanfall 2&#x27;s small but dedicated fanbase, but now it seems Respawn has not only addressed the server issues, but also got Titanfall fans excited that something new may be on the horizon, too.

                              <span>Fables author and artist Bill Willingham – yes, the same Bill Willingham behind Telltale&#x27;s The Wolf Among Us game – has put the rights to the Fables intellectual property into the public domain.

&quot;As of now, 15 September 2023, the comic book property called Fables, including all related Fables spin-offs and characters, is now in the public domain,&quot; Willingham wrote on his substack. &quot;What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time. It’s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.&quot;

Wondering why Willingham has done this? You&#x27;re not alone. The author said he&#x27;s made the decision to move everything into the public domain for &quot;a number of reasons&quot;, including &quot;practicality&quot; – Willingham feels much has changed since he first signed his contract with DC Comics – and &quot;philosophy&quot;, as his &quot;thoughts on how to reform the trademark and copyright laws in this country (and others, I suppose) have undergone something of a radical transformation&quot;.

                              <span>Another day, another Starfield exploit. This one lets players plunder the inventory of the poor unsuspecting shopkeeper in Akila City.

Just like Skyrim&#x27;s old infinite money glitch, players have found a sneaky way to rob the Shepherd&#x27;s General Store if they&#x27;re in third-person and situate themselves just-so in front of a very unassuming puddle.

&quot;WOW,&quot; YouTuber JamieMoranUK posted to X/Twitter. &quot;If you go to Akila City, look in a puddle in front of the store, Shepherds. You can get all the store&#x27;s inventory for FREE.

                              <span>To celebrate 2023&#x27;s World Cleanup Day, publisher Secret Mode has confirmed that indie Loddlenaut – a game all about clearing up the pollution left behind by evil megacorps – will release on 16th November 2023.

The &quot;creature-raising survival game&quot; lets you explore an open-world, alien planet, raise your own loddles, clear up debris with your bubble gun, recycle trash to create upgrades and more helpful items, and unlock new gadgets to ensure you can clear up even the most stubborn ocean pollution.

Not sure if this kind of &quot;cosy pollution-cleaning adventure awash with creature-raising and survival systems&quot; is for you? To help you make up your mind, a demo is now available on Steam for PC and – wait for it – Mac players to give it a go.

                              <span>NetherRealm has deployed a day-one patch for Mortal Kombat 1 on consoles and Switch.

The patch notes reveal that for both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, improvements include &quot;fleshed out&quot; accessibility options – see below – as well as character &quot;polish and tuning&quot;, &quot;improved and refined&quot; UI, and the addition of &quot;numerous finishing moves&quot;.

There are also some tweaks to the online system, including improvements to the matchmaking and &quot;online mode bugs&quot;, with the story campaign getting a little TLC, too, including movie player improvements, 4K resolution, the tuning of &quot;story finale and final boss&quot;, plus a liberal application of &quot;visual polish&quot; to a number of cinematic sequences.

                              <span>Women in Games has set the theme for its upcoming annual conference: Disruption.

&quot;Asking direct questions to look forward and build a better, progressive future for women in games and esports around the world&quot;, the online conference will take place on 10th October, 2023. Tickets cost £30.

&quot;From questions based on original research about representation such as &#x27;What&#x27;s going wrong with women&#x27;s dialogue in video games?&#x27;, to questions from returning innovators about pay such as &#x27;Salary Transparency: Breaking the Game or Path to Success?&#x27;, the Women in Games Annual Global Conference will offer abundant challenges to the prevailing lack of fairness, whether that be in work or play environments,&quot; a press release says.

                              <span>Payday 3 developer Starbreeze has confirmed the upcoming heist shooter will not have the controversial DRM system Denuvo. 

In a concise update posted to Steam, Starbreeze simply said hello to its heisters and revealed in no-nonsense terms that &quot;Denuvo is no longer in Payday 3&quot;.

The update comes a few weeks after fans shared screenshots within the Payday subreddit that intimated Payday 3 would feature the controversial anti-piracy software. Two months later, however, the Steam storefront has been updated, and Denuvo is no longer listed (thanks, PC Gamer).

In a note posted to X/Twitter, the studio said it had identified and removed &quot;2000+&quot; cheaters and reminded players to &quot;report any suspicious player activity through [its] in-game tools&quot;.

The Harbingers Collection Event – which sees our Legends &quot;gear up to fight the end of the world&quot; – launches on all platforms on 19th September and includes Living Shell Trios, World’s Edge After Dark, and the usual cosmetics.

Well then Sony might just, depending on your idea of tasteful, have what you&#x27;re looking for: three new metallic console covers (and matching controllers) that are almost certainly not going to match your existing decor!


Sony&#x27;s newly announced Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, and Sterling Silver cover/controller combos are, according to a post on the PlayStation Blog, inspired by the &quot;beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth&quot; - all of which have then bee &quot;elevated&quot; with a metallic finish for a &quot;touch of sophistication.&quot;


Those interested in giving their PS5 a &quot;Deep Earth&quot; makeover can, when the appropriate time comes, pick up each of the three shiny new covers for £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers (sold separately) will each cost £64.99/€74.99/$74.99 USD.

                              <span>Frictional Games fans could be forgiven for thinking the horror-focused studio has been getting a little soft in recent years, having introduced death-free and monster-free modes in post-launch updates for its acclaimed SOMA and Amnesia: Rebirth. This year, though, it&#x27;s going in completely the opposite direction, and its recently launched WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker will be getting even more nerve-frayingly horrifying, just in time for Halloween.


As spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun, Frictional&#x27;s creative lead Fredrik Olsson has recently been using social media to detail some of the delightfully sadistic new features coming to Amnesia: The Bunker soon in what will known as Shell Shocked mode.


For starters, players who&#x27;ve been relying on the comparative tranquility of The Bunker&#x27;s Admin Office safe room to emotionally, physically, and mentally regroup will, in Shell Shocked mode, be a little bit screwed. Now, its reassuringly sturdy steel doors will be replaced wood, which, you know, isn&#x27;t all that resistant to scrambling, pounding, shredding monster claws.

                              <span>Ubisoft Montreal - the studio behind the likes of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Far Cry 5 - has been accused of leaving staff in &quot;turmoil&quot; after it reportedly reneged on promises that &quot;100% remote work would be possible&quot;, forcing all 4,000 of its workers back to the office for a &quot;minimum&quot; of two days a week, as of 11th September.


Back in June 2021, Ubisoft announced it would be adopting a &quot;hybrid and tailored approach to work arrangements&quot; where staff would be able &quot;to balance in-office work with work from home&quot;. However, according to a new report by IGN, Ubisoft Montreal staff were repeatedly told they could remain 100% remote long-term, leading many to make significant life decision or accept jobs at the company based around these assurances.


&quot;100% remote work will be possible depending on various criteria,&quot; reads an internal Ubisoft document seen by IGN and detailed in its report, &quot;such as productivity and impact on the team, as well as the nature of the work being done.&quot;

                              <span>American Truck Simulator trundles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has now confirmed its next stop (after the already announced but not-yet-released stops of Kansas and Nebraska, that is) will be the state of Arkansas.


This marks something of an interesting (I realise your mileage may vary on this point) deviation for SCS, which has so far been making its way across the US map in a bottom-to-top, left-to-right fashion, starting with California. This latest news means once Kansas and Nebraska are released, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Louisiana will be missing from the expected progression.


Arkansas, the so-called Natural State (mine is &quot;asleep&quot;), will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 16th state when it arrives at some currently undisclosed future point, and SCS Software&#x27;s rendition promises everything from &quot;stunning mountain vistas to towering forests&quot;.

A new release date trailer for the game was shown at last night&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, which included a shot of Cloud and Sephiroth together in battle. In a follow-up interview on the PlayStation Blog, creative director Tetsuya Nomura confirmed Sephiroth will be playable.


&quot;If you played the original Final Fantasy 7, I&#x27;m sure you can guess which scene I&#x27;m talking about,&quot; he said. &quot;You will be able to control Sephiroth in the same scene in this title as you did in the original.&quot;

                              <span>As revealed in PlayStation&#x27;s recent State of Play, Honaki: Star Rail is coming to PS5 on 11th October, 2023.


Developed by HoYoverse, the company behind Genshin Impact, Star Rail is an anime-styled turn-based RPG with a gacha system, and has already been in the hands of PC and mobile players for five months.


While Star Rail is a free download, you can purchase its PS5 &quot;pre-order&quot; bundle for £9.49 to get some in-game items when it releases, and the ability to pre-download the game on PS5. But these in-game items are fairly unhelpful in the grand scheme of getting and building characters, especially when compared to its battle pass, the &quot;Nameless Honor&quot;, which upgrades its free track to premium for £9.99 and offers far more helpful materials and weapons.

                              <span>Ascendant Studios, the developer behind the EA published Immortals of Aveum, has laid off almost half of its staff.


Ascendant CEO Bret Robbins shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating 45 percent of the team have been let go - a &quot;painfully difficult, but necessary decision that was not made lightly&quot;.


According to a report from Polygon, around 40 people were laid off, with one former employee claiming poor sales of Immortals of Aveum was a key reason.

With technology like that on Mr. Leyvand’s head, Facebook could prevent users from ever forgetting a colleague’s name, give a reminder at a cocktail party that an acquaintance had kids to ask about or help find someone at a crowded conference. However, six years later, the company now known as Meta has not released a version of that product and Mr. Leyvand has departed for Apple to work on its Vision Pro augmented reality glasses.

The technology is here. Maybe the implementation is still dorky, but that will change. The social implications will be enormous...</span>
