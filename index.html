                    <span>Developers have distanced themselves from publisher Tripwire after its boss said he was &quot;proud&quot; a draconian Texas anti-abortion law was allowed to stand.
John Gibson, president of the Chivalry 2, Killing Floor and Maneater publisher, tweeted to say he &quot;felt it was important to go on the record as a pro-life game developer&quot;.
Atlanta, Georgia-based co-developer Shipwright Studios, which worked on Chivalry 2 and Maneater, tweeted in response to say it had cancelled all its existing contracts with Tripwire.

                    <span>Shenmue 2 is 20 years old today.
First released on Dreamcast on 6th September 2001 in Japan, it came to Europe a few months later on November 23rd - and was an Xbox exclusive in North America when it eventually arrived in October the following year.
You can watch Digital Foundry compare the 2018 remaster of Shenmue I and II on modern platforms versus the Dreamcast original:

The good news is that product vendors are fixing this:
Several of the headphones which could be tracked over time are for sale in electronics stores, but according to two of the manufacturers NRK have spoken to, these models are being phased out.
“The products in your line-up, Elite Active 65t, Elite 65e and Evolve 75e, will be going out of production before long and newer versions have already been launched with randomized MAC addresses. We have a lot of focus on privacy by design and we continuously work with the available security measures on the market,” head of PR at Jabra, Claus Fonnesbech says...</span>

                    <span>The former boss of PlayStation has predicted PlayStation 5 games will cost $200m to make.
Shawn Layden, who held various executive roles at PlayStation before leaving in October 2019, told Bloomberg the cost of game development doubles with every platform.
Budgets for PlayStation 4 games Layden spearheaded each hit $100m, and, Bloomberg reports, Layden predicts PS5 games will each cost $200m to make and prices will only increase from there.

                    <span>This week, Halo developer 343 began testing Halo: The Master Chief Collection Season 8 content for Halo 3 and Reach, giving players their first taste of new &quot;alternate universe&quot; armour skins - and it&#x27;s fair to say they&#x27;ve sparked quite the debate within the community.
Season 8 of MCC is called Mythic and showcases Halo &quot;in a deliberately divergent way&quot;, 343 franchise and narrative writer at 343, Jeff Easterling, said in a post on Halo Waypoint.
He&#x27;s not kidding. Each of the new armour sets for use in Halo 3 multiplayer within MCC is focused on &quot;reimagining the core Mjolnir armour as alternate universe amalgams based on legendary ancient warriors&quot;, including Greek and Norse mythology. We&#x27;re playing as Spartans, after all!

Barone replied to explain why having almost everyone in the game be marriageable would be &quot;just a tonne of work&quot;.

                    <span>Sony has issued a dramatic U-turn on its controversial Horizon Forbidden West PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 upgrade policy following a vociferous backlash.
Sony was heavily criticised after it confirmed Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s standard and special editions did not include Dual Entitlement, Sony&#x27;s label for granting you both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the same game, after Sony had previously said it would offer free upgrades for its cross-gen launch titles.
In an update issued to the PlayStation Blog, Sony Interactive Entertainment boss Jim Ryan said its offers for Guerrilla&#x27;s Horizon Forbidden West &quot;missed the mark&quot;.

                    <span>The makers of another long-running GTA San Andreas mod have pulled it offline themselves amid the ongoing crackdown by Take-Two.
The lead developer of GTA Underground, one of the largest, most ambitious mods for the 16-year-old Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, announced development had ceased and all downloads hauled offline after six years of work.
This was &quot;due to the increasing hostility towards the modding community and imminent danger to our mental and financial well-being&quot;, chief developer dkluin wrote in a post on GTAForums.com.

                    <span>Ubisoft has warned Rainbow Six Siege AFK abuse &quot;will be sanctioned&quot;.
The developer said it had noticed the &quot;rising issue&quot; of players abusing AFK methods in recent weeks, which it said had disrupted play in the competitive online shooter.
Last night, Ubisoft issued a wave of manual sanctions as it confirmed it was &quot;evaluating design changes&quot; to address the problem. Meanwhile, it&#x27;s adding new automatic AFK detections.

                    <span>Halo Infinite developer 343 has tweaked the game&#x27;s radar so it feels more like the motion tracker seen in previous Halo titles.
Infinite&#x27;s combat sensor sparked a debate within the Halo community after it made its debut during the recent technical preview.
The combat sensor is the radar that sits in the bottom-left of your HUD. In the classic Halo games, the radar shows all movement except crouch-walking. But Halo Infinite&#x27;s radar worked differently - it only displayed enemies when they were sprinting or shooting - a change that made it similar to Halo 5&#x27;s Threat Tracker.

                    <span>One of The Sims 4&#x27;s earliest expansions, 2015&#x27;s Spa Day, is getting a refresh next week, introducing a whole range of new features and improvements that&#x27;ll be free to existing owners.
The original Spa Day (one of EA&#x27;s mid-tier Game Packs, sitting between the smaller-scale Stuff Packs and more substantial Expansion Packs) brought a focus on health and relaxation to the Sims 4, adding the new spa building type where visiting Sims could de-stress and re-energise, enjoying everything from steam baths and stone massages to yoga and meditation.
As outlined in developer Maxis&#x27; latest livestream, next week&#x27;s surprisingly expansive update to Spa Day will bring new features and tighter integration with the core game. There&#x27;s a new High Maintenance trait, for instance, which can be soothed by a day at the spa, giving a little more impetus to use the facilities. Meanwhile, the old Wellness skill has now been expanded so that child Sims can take advantage of its calming benefits by participating in yoga and meditation (while wearing some new activity appropriate clothing, no less).

In distributed systems, it can be hard to figure out where problems are. You grep through one component&#x27;s logs just to discover that the source of your problem is in another component.  You search there only to discover that you need to enable debug logs to figure out what really went wrong... And it goes on. The more complex the path your request takes, the harder it is to answer questions about where it went.  I&#x27;ve personally spent many hours doing this dance with a variety of Kubernetes components. Distributed tracing is a tool which is designed to help in these situations, and the Kubernetes API Server is, perhaps, the most important Kubernetes component to be able to debug. At Kubernetes&#x27; Sig Instrumentation, our mission is to make it easier to understa…</span>

                    <span>Back in 2019, PUBG creative director Brendan &quot;PlayerUnknown&quot; Greene shared a teaser video for his mysterious next project Prologue, and now, following news of his departure from PUBG parent company Krafton, the developer has revealed more.
Prologue started life at Krafton&#x27;s Amsterdam-based PUBG Special Projects, and will continue to be developed at Greene&#x27;s new studio PlayerUnknown Productions, with Krafton investing in the new company with a minority stake.
Setting the scene for Prologue in a new video shared on Twitter, Greene explained, &quot;I&#x27;ve held this deep fascination with sandbox-style open-world games and the freedom they give their players but I always just wished they were a bit bigger, so that&#x27;s our mission as a studio - we want to create realistic sandbox worlds on a scale that&#x27;s seldom attempted.&quot;

                    <span>Back in July, reports began circulating that the beta of Amazon&#x27;s MMO New World was bricking pricey EVGA-manufactured RTX 3090 graphics cards. A subsequent statement from Amazon insisted the beta was &quot;safe to play&quot;, and it looks like it were right - EVGA has now investigated the issue, revealing the hardware failures were the result of dodgy soldering.
When reports of card failures began to surface, some users speculated the problem was due to power spikes and overheating caused by uncapped framerates in the New World beta&#x27;s menus. While Amazon set about capping the framerate as a precautionary measure, EVGA began replacing affected cards and investigating returns to find out exactly what was going on.
Sharing its findings with PC World, EVGA has now revealed that while it wasn&#x27;t able to replicate the issue using a copy of the New World beta, under X-ray analysis the less-than-two-dozen impacted RTX 3090s it received - all originating from an early 2020 production run - displayed &quot;poor workmanship&quot; on the soldering around the MOSFET circuits that powered the cards.

                    <span>Fortnite has announced its next live event, Operation: Sky Fire, which will act as an explosive finale to its current UFO-themed season.
Operation: Sky Fire will be held live in-game next Sunday, 12th September at 9pm UK time (that&#x27;s 4pm Eastern, 1pm Pacific). 
Epic Games advises you log-in 30 minutes early to access the event playlist and avoid disappointment.

                    <span>It looks like GamesMaster is actively seeking contestants for the show&#x27;s reboot. 
An advert published by Future on GameFAQs by the user Albert Bankolé (thanks, VGC) asks for contestants for a &quot;landmark video gaming TV series&quot;. The post was quickly taken down by a moderator, but a cached version is still available. 
While it doesn&#x27;t specifically say which show the casting is for, we do know Future owns the rights to the GamesMaster trademark.

                    <span>In the latest of a series of legal battles by Take-Two Interactive, the developers of the re3 project are being sued by the company in the state of California. 
What&#x27;s so significant about this particular project is that it&#x27;s built on completely reverse engineered source code of Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. It&#x27;s also been ported over to the Nintendo Switch, Playstation Vita and Nintendo Wii U.
Under US law, reverse engineering is generally legal. To further minimise encroachment of the law, the developers avoided using any leaked source code, and any copyrighted assets such as music, dialogue and images. Rather, players need to own the original game in order to get those assets.

                    <span>A new eight-episode anime series will celebrate Pokémon&#x27;s 25th anniversary - and also see the return of fan-favourite character Ball Guy.
Pokémon Sword and Shield&#x27;s Ball Guy is not to be trusted. We&#x27;ve covered this already. He may jump, cheer and dance to encourage you through gym battles, but underneath that head lies Pokémon&#x27;s true monster.
Watch out, then, for Pokémon Evolutions. This limited-run series will debut next week on Pokémon&#x27;s YouTube channel and Pokémon TV app, and feature each of the franchise&#x27;s eight regions to date in reverse chronological order.

                    <span>Square Enix has released a crowd vote plug-in for Life is Strange: True Colors, which streamers can install now.
The Twitch extension can be customised so that viewers&#x27; choices for big decisions are automatically implemented, or simply to poll the audience without them actually making the final call.
Life is Strange: True Colors launches next Friday, 10th September, but Twitch streamers can install the add-on already to prepare for some of the game&#x27;s tougher narrative choices.

                    <span>Nintendo is set to add Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles to Nintendo Switch Online, Eurogamer sources have confirmed. 
Word that Nintendo will bulk up its Switch Online back catalogue first broke earlier this week via the Nate the Hate podcast, which discussed various possible handheld games Nintendo could bring to the Switch subscription offering. Nintendo Life sources then offered their own confirmation. 
Now, Eurogamer has been able to separately corroborate these reports - and we have heard that other retro platforms are also on the cards.

                    <span>Beyond a Steel Sky, the sequel to beloved 90s point-and-click adventure Beneath a Steel Sky, is making the leap to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 30th November.
Beyond a Steel Sky, which initially released for iOS and PC last summer, reunites designer Charles Cecil and art director Dave Gibbons - the duo responsible for the first game - for another bout of dystopian sci-fi adventure.
This time around, returning protagonist Robert Foster plots a course for Union City - a fortified utopia in a war-ravaged world, where &quot;people live happily under the surveillance and control of a benign AI&quot; - in search of an abducted child.

                    <span>Just one day after announcing players will be able to shove Hello Kitty into a Monkey Ball following the release of Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania next month, Sega has revealed another post-launch DLC character for its simian-rolling platformer: Monster Rancher&#x27;s Suezo.
For those previously unfamiliar with Koei Tecmo&#x27;s long-running Monster Rancher series (and I count myself in that number), its blend of sim-like creature-rearing and battling originally debuted on PlayStation back in 1997, meaning next year marks its 25th anniversary.
Koei Tecmo previously revealed it&#x27;s releasing versions of the first two Monster Rancher games on Switch in the west this December as part of the series&#x27; birthday celebrations (the first time Monster Rancher has travelled west in over a decade), but we now know those anniversary festivities will also extend to shoving one of the games&#x27; most iconic monsters - yellow one-eyed worm-thing Suezo - into a Monkey Ball too.

                    <span>Minecraft Live - developer Mojang&#x27;s annual livestream celebration of all things Minecraft - returns this year for another parade of block-based news and japery on Saturday, 16th October.
Specifics are somewhat limited at the moment - Mojang&#x27;s announcement doesn&#x27;t amount to much beyond a &#x27;save the date&#x27; - but the developer is teasing appearances from &quot;new and familiar faces&quot; within the studio and Minecraft community for &quot;in-depth interviews, exciting reveals, a nail-biting vote, and puns galore&quot;.
Last year&#x27;s show saw the announcement of Minecraft&#x27;s massive Caves &amp; Cliffs update (which has since been split into two more manageable development chunks), and gave fans the opportunity to vote on the Minecraft Dungeons or Minecraft Earth mob they wanted to see introduced to the main game - with the exotic Glow Squid ultimately being the oceanic victor.

Here in the UK, Pokémon Go Safari Zone: Liverpool will now be held Friday 15th to Sunday 17th October in the city&#x27;s Sefton Park.

                    <span>Crysis Remastered Trilogy - which, as its name suggest, bundles together fancied-up editions of developer Crytek&#x27;s acclaimed first-person shooters Crysis 1, 2, and 3 - is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 15th October.
2007&#x27;s original Crysis got the remaster treatment last Autumn, bringing various tweaks and enhancements for modern-era machines, and 15th October will see the game&#x27;s two sequels - or, more specifically, their single-player campaigns - getting a similarly thorough spruce-up.
Crytek promises improved lighting, high-definition textures, plus visually enhanced characters, weapons, and environments, with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S running the games between 1080p and 4K at 60fps using Dynamic resolution.

                    <span>Pre-orders for Horizon Forbidden West have gone live, and once again fans face a range of options and editions which may/may not include both PlayStation 4 and PS5 versions of the game. 
Neither the game&#x27;s Standard or Special editions include Dual Entitlement, Sony&#x27;s label for granting you both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the same game. 
To be clear, you can always play the PS4 version of Horizon Forbidden West on your PS5. But you won&#x27;t automatically get the PS5-optimised version, and according to Sony&#x27;s pre-order support FAQ, &quot;there are no plans for an update offer&quot; at this time.

This showcase will be fronted by Geoff Keighley - who else? - and be shown on YouTube, Twitch and Steam (no word yet on 8chan).

                    <span>CD Projekt has told investors it &quot;can&#x27;t say with full certainty&quot; that its highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 next-gen updates will launch this year, despite the developer insisting it&#x27;s still aiming for a &quot;late 2021&quot; release.
An enhanced edition of The Witcher 3 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S - promising the likes of ray-tracing and faster loader times - was announced last September, while a &quot;proper&quot; next-gen version of Cyberpunk 2077 was touted in June 2020.
Both were initially scheduled for launch this year, but the status of each has been somewhat unclear in light of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s disastrous launch and the resulting studio reshuffle and revised development roadmap as CD Projekt worked to improve the base game.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been curious about XCOM developer Firaxis&#x27; foray into superhero-themed strategy following the formal unveiling of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns last month, some of your questions may now have answers, courtesy of an official first look at the game in action.
Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns takes inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s, which told the story of a band of supernatural superheroes as they battled against Lilith, Mother of All Demons. In Firaxis&#x27; game, Lilith has been resurrected by Hydra and will stop at nothing to fulfil a prophecy and bring back her master using the full force of her demonic army. In response to this hellish threat, the Caretaker chooses to reform the Midnight Sons with a few new heroes in tow - including the Avengers, who decide to revive legendary hero The Hunter, the child of Lilith and the only one known to have defeated her before.
That&#x27;s the basic premise of Midnight Suns, with the ensuing action - which promises a &quot;deeply customisable tactical battle system that rewards clever thinking with superhero flair&quot; - sounding like a blend of card-battling turn-based combat and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building.

                    <span>Impostor Factory, the third game in developer Freebird Games&#x27; well-received To the Moon series, will be making its way to Steam on 30th September.
Described as a &quot;bonkers time-loop tragicomedy murder mystery thriller featuring multiple casualties and a suspicious cat&quot;, Impostor Factory is designed as a completely standalone adventure (albeit one slotting somewhere within the series&#x27; timeline), requiring no knowledge of 2011&#x27;s lo-fi tearjerker To the Moon or its first proper sequel Finding Paradise.
This time around, the focus is on a man named Quincy who accepts an invitation to a &quot;suspiciously secluded&quot; mansion, only to discover a time machine in its bathroom. &quot;But of course, then people start dying,&quot; explains Freebird on Impostor Factory&#x27;s Steam page. &quot;And somewhere along the way, things get a little Lovecraftian and tentacles are involved.&quot;

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to live the life of a space sheriff in some intergalactic frontier town, No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s latest free update has you well and truly covered.
No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Frontiers update - the 17th (!) to release since launch - arrives today on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, bringing something a little bit different to Hello Games&#x27; ever-expanding exploratory space sim. Players can now stumble across procedurally generated Mos-Eisley-like settlements while exploring inhabited planets around the galaxy, each featuring unique buildings, neighbourhood layouts, colour schemes, and interior and exterior decorations.
Intriguingly, settlements serve as more than just points of interest for roving space tourists; players can agree to become the overseer of an ungoverned settlement, whereupon they&#x27;ll be placed in charge of everything from town planning and treasury management to policy making and conflict resolution, even defending from enemy attacks when required.

                    <span>A detailed Proof Games report into Mark Haspel, the co-founder of game grading company Wata, has brought to light worrying details of his business activities, and of Wata in general. 
Wata appraises and rates the quality of collectible video games, often pushing their prices into the hundreds and thousands of dollars. To avoid any conflict of interest, it has previously stated it does not allow employees to have their own games graded or sell any that have been graded by the company. 
But, this week, Proof Games&#x27; Seth Abramson discovered he had apparently bought several WATA-graded video games from an eBay seller that turned out to be Haspel. One of his purchases reportedly included a yellow sticky note that invited Abramson to email Haspel privately &quot;for more games&quot;.

It has been a couple of years since Greene was involved in development of PUBG. In 2019, he launched PUBG Special Projects, a new Amsterdam-based division which had been working on a fresh project codenamed Prologue. 
Greene&#x27;s new company is also based in Amsterdam and looks like it may continue working on Prologue, with Krafton investing in the new company with a minority stake.

                    <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s colony builder Surviving Mars, which officially resumed development earlier this year under the watchful eye of Abstraction Games, is getting a brand-new expansion, titled Below and Beyond, next Tuesday 7th September, 
Surviving Mars - which challenges players to rejuvenate the wastes of the red planet, transforming it into a thriving colony of shimmering domes - was well-received when it launched in 2018. A selection of DLC followed, but Below and Beyond will be the game&#x27;s first major expansion since 2019&#x27;s Green Planet. A free tourism update released earlier this year.
Below &amp; Beyond, as its name implies, takes the colony builder to new locales, going below Mars&#x27; surface and beyond its horizon so that players may turn their attention to building underground bases, mining asteroids, and gathering rare resources.

                    <span>Dead Space fans have been treated to a very early look at EA&#x27;s highly anticipated remake of the sci-fi horror favourite as part of an &quot;unorthodox&quot; new livestream - and while the project is still &quot;really, really far from being done&quot;, according to developer EA Motive, the included new footage and details might be enough to keep interest piqued until more is ready to be revealed.
EA Motive&#x27;s decision to show off its Dead Space remake so early in development is, by its own admission, a &quot;bit unorthodox&quot; for EA, but it says it wants &quot;to be open with the communication&quot; in order gather feedback on the direction it&#x27;s taking.
To that end, the developer has shared a few early details - and, in some cases, glimpses - of the remake, beginning with a look at its initial efforts to enhance the original Dead Space&#x27;s visuals for the modern era. As shown during the livestream, this involved the art team revisiting the 2008 game&#x27;s legacy assets, adding details to existing geometry, applying shaders, materials, and VFX, plus a first pass at lighting to get the mood right. The results, as you&#x27;ll see if you hop through the livestream below, are certainly striking.

                    <span>Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town, the latest entry in developer Marvelous Inc&#x27;s much-loved farm-life series, is making the jump from Switch to PC on 15th September.
Pioneers of Olive Town, sticking firmly to the well-worn Story of Seasons template, casts players as a newcomer to a peaceful community after they inherit the local farm from their grandfather. The usual formula of busily compulsive seasonal crop-growing and animal-rearing follows, with players once again free explore the nearby village and befriend the local in their downtime.
This latest instalment in the series initially launched on Switch back in March, where it received rather mixed reviews - with critics calling out some wonky performance, a disappointingly lifeless cast of townsfolk, and some questionable design decisions, such as a bizarre over-reliance on fussily implemented Maker machines to get things done.

                    <span>Men in Black. Independence Day. After Earth? Will Smith is no stranger to fighting aliens. Now, he can do so in Fortnite. 
To presumably celebrate the game&#x27;s genuinely very enjoyable alien season, you can now purchase Will Smith in Fortnite.  The only downside? He&#x27;s called Mike Lowery, and this is Will Smith&#x27;s character from the decidedly non-alien focused Bad Boys trilogy.
Digital rights weirdness aside, Smith&#x27;s arrival in Fortnite comes after a series of high profile stars arrived via the game&#x27;s Icon Series as themselves: Ariana Grande, J Balvin and LeBron James.

                    <span>Love Devil May Cry? Got a spare £3000 kicking about? Treat yourself to this half-scale statue of Dante.
As spotted by Siliconera, the statue - released to honour the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary - is a three-dimensional, &quot;real-life quality&quot; vision of Dante. It&#x27;s expected to ship between November 2022 and February 2023, and the hefty cover price does not include shipping or customs/import tax fees. 
Created by Prime1 studio, the 43-inch tall, pint-sized Dante boasts artificial hair - which includes an alternate silicon head - a silicon body for that, uh, &quot;lifelike&quot; skin, and a full outfit, including his iconic red leather coat. Each one will be hand-finished, so prospective buyers are told to expect some &quot;individual differences&quot; between models.

                    <span>Fall Guys, Mediatonic&#x27;s knockabout battle royale game, has reintroduced its &quot;No Teams&quot; playlist for players who prefer to go solo than duke it out as a team.
The change comes because of &quot;unprecedented&quot; complaints from players who are frustrated by rounds that require teamwork, presumably because - and I know this from personal experience - there&#x27;s a small but pervasive underclass of players that thinks it&#x27;s funny to mess about and throw the round.
&quot;There has been unprecedented complaints regarding levels in which you compete as part of a unit,&quot; reports Beanbot on the game&#x27;s hugely popular Twitter account. &quot;Duly, we have reinstated a playlist called &#x27;No Teams&#x27;.

                    <span>Bungie has &quot;temporarily disabled&quot; the Destiny 2&#x27;s Radiant Dance Machines leg armour in all PvP and Gambit activities.
Confirmation came way of a tweet from the Destiny 2 studio, which acknowledged the armour permitted Hunters to dodge &quot;an unintended amount of times&quot;, including during competitive matches in its Gambit and Crucible playlists.
&quot;Due to an issue that allows Hunters to dodge an unintended amount of times in a row, we have temporarily disabled the Radiant Dance Machines Exotic Hunter leg armor in Gambit and all PvP activities,&quot; the studio said.

Though Reedus didn&#x27;t give away too much in the Portuguese interview - and auto-translations can sometimes be inaccurate, meaning we can only take this as a rumour for now - IGN Brasil reports he said he &quot;thinks&quot; a second Death Stranding is on the way.
&quot;I think we&#x27;re doing a second Death Stranding,&quot; Reedus told AdoroCinema, which is a partner site of IGN Brasil. &quot;[Death Stranding 2] is in negotiations right now. So... yay!&quot; Reedus reportedly said to journalists at a recent The Walking Dead roundtable.

In a series of tweets, the company said &quot;the power of play makes us heroes in new worlds every day&quot;, telling its 16.5 million followers that &quot;you can be a hero in real life too by getting vaccinated against COVID-19, protecting yourself [and] the people around you&quot;.
The thread goes on to share the &quot;key takeaways&quot; from a COVID-19 Q&amp;A with the CDC&#x27;s Deputy Director for Infectious Diseases, Dr Jay Butler, and Dr Judy Monroe, president and CEO of the CDC Foundation.

The information comes courtesy of the French forum Dealabs. Though forums can be unreliable given anyone can post just about anything, in this instance poster Billbil-kun was asked to verify the rumour - something they reportedly did to the moderation&#x27;s team&#x27;s satisfaction, which is why the post has not been removed (thanks, VGC).
Overcooked! All You Can Eat features both Overcooked titles, Overcooked! and Overcooked! 2 in &quot;stunning, enhanced 4K visuals&quot;, &quot;blended together and remastered in this delicious definitive edition&quot; on PS5 complete with extra add-on content.

The patch is now live for The Ascent on Steam, and is currently going through the deployment process for Windows Store and Xbox console, developer Neon Giant said in a post on Steam.
The most important part of the patch for me is it targets performance improvements for the PC version, specifically the Windows Store version.

Chief among them is a new map for Halo 3 called Icebox, which is a remake of the classic Halo 2 map, Turf.
Icebox was originally a multiplayer map from the cancelled Halo Online (343 has added Halo Online maps to Halo 3 before). Unlike the original, which is set in Mombasa, Icebox is set in the Russian city of Tyumen.

This blog describes the notion of Availability for StatefulSet workloads, and a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.22 which adds minReadySeconds configuration for StatefulSets.
What problems does this solve?
Prior to Kubernetes 1.22 release, once a StatefulSet Pod is in the Ready state it is considered Available to receive traffic. For some of the StatefulSet workloads, it may not be the case. For example, a workload like Prometheus with multiple instances of Alertmanager, it should be considered Available only when Alertmanager&#x27;s state transfer is complete, not when the Pod is in Ready state. Since minReadySeconds adds buffer, the state transfer may be complete before the Pod becomes Available. While this is not a fool proof way of…</span>

                    <span>Moonglow Bay, developer Bunnyhug&#x27;s &quot;slice-of-life fishing RPG&quot;, is readying to raise anchor and set sail for Xbox, PC, and Game Pass on 7th October.
Set in a struggling 1980s Canadian coastal town where people are afraid to fish, Moonglow Bay draws inspiration from the likes of Harvest Moon and Legend of the River King, aiming to &quot;capture the magic of fishing and make it the heart of everything&quot;.
Players take on the role of a rookie angler trying to full their partner&#x27;s last wish and keep their business afloat - a task Moonglow Bay thankfully pitches more toward relaxing village-life sim than soul-sapping struggle on the brink of destitution.

                    <span>Blasphemous, developer The Game Kitchen&#x27;s superb gothic action-platformer, is wrapping up its brooding redemption adventure on 9th December with the arrival of another free story expansion, titled Wounds of Eventide, plus there&#x27;s a fully fledged sequel due in 2023.
Blasphemous, which released to well-deserved acclaim back in 2019, tells the story of The Penitent One, a pointy hatted fellow with a barbed-wire sword, forced to venture across the accursed kingdom of Cvstodia - a desolate, but lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness.
It&#x27;s wonderful stuff, serving up an engaging blend of 2D Souls-like and Metroidvania bolstered by some fascinating world-building and gorgeously wrought, grimly unforgettable imagery. Needless to say, it was an absolute pleasure to return to Blasphemous the following year when The Game Kitchen continued The Penitent One&#x27;s tale in its free The Stir of Dawn DLC.

                    <span>American Truck Simulator is finally ready roll out to a brand-new destination, with its long-awaited Wyoming expansion now confirmed for release on 7th September.
Wyoming is the eighth state to be added to American Truck Simulator since its launch in 2016 - following developer SCS&#x27; increasingly lavish recreations of Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, and Colorado - and opens up myriad new routes for long-distance haulers and landscape fetishists to enjoy.
Wyoming will link up American Truck Simulator&#x27;s previous Colorado, Idaho, and Utah expansions for more convenient cross-country trucking, just leaving a Montana-shaped gap at the very top of the game&#x27;s map. Of course, we already know SCS&#x27; next destination is to the east, with the developer having confirmed it&#x27;s hard at work capturing the vast sprawl of Texas for its next expansion release as it slowly ticks off all 50 states.

With the release of No More Heroes 3 today, which got a Eurogamer Recommended badge and an overwhelmingly positive review, its creator, Goichi Suda, announced the game will be the last in the series. 
&quot;As hinted at with the &#x27;Final&#x27; thing, Travis Touchdown will finally be coming to the end of his final battle, and will be embarking on a much-deserved, long journey. Join him as he goes absolutely buck wild in the Garden - no, Cosmos of Madness!&quot; Suda shared in a statement.

Quickly, then, developer Volition has revealed a longer, more in-depth look at the game&#x27;s Santo Ileso setting via our first proper peek at in-game footage.
Santo Ileso&#x27;s south-western US setting is a departure for the series - though Volition developers here make the case that it will still be &quot;strange&quot;. Next, its cast of four main characters who become friends - the Boss (that&#x27;s you), Eli the investor, Nina the gearhead and Kevin, a shirtless wannabe TV chef.

                    <span>Apple has agreed to let iOS App Store developers email their users and mention alternative payment options outside of the company&#x27;s App Store. 
This means, for example, a game company who holds a user&#x27;s email address could then contact that person to suggest they buy a season pass or in-game currency directly from them, rather than via the App Store where Apple takes its cut. 
Until now, Apple did not let developers use any contact information obtained from within an app to contact their users outside of the app. A class-action lawsuit said this was unfair, and blocked the ability for them to inform customers of cheaper purchase options (thanks, Ars Technica).

                    <span>In the game that will never die, Rockstar has added a brand-new game mode into GTA Online, but rather than being a throwaway update that will be forgotten about in a month, this one genuinely is quite fun.
Kart Krash: Full Auto sees players fight to be the last one surviving in teams or chaotic free-for-alls, using the weapons attached to their go-karts and assorted power-ups scattered about the map to take their opponents out. It&#x27;s a bit like Mario Kart&#x27;s Battle Mode, except there&#x27;s tanks and machine guns. 
Go-karts aren&#x27;t new to the game, having arrived back in December with The Cayo Perico Heist. But the new game mode dedicates these vehicles to their own arena.

Phew, okay. So, picking up from that last trailer, clearly here we have a very living and angry Chozo who Samus must fight. Why are they living? Why are they angry? I am looking forward to Metroid Dread providing answers to these questions.

But in a post on 343&#x27;s Inside Infinite blog, lead writer Joseph Staten explained that the team is currently in &quot;shutdown mode&quot; as they polish the game for final release.

                    <span>Assetto Corsa Competizione - one of the very best racing sims available at the moment, if you&#x27;ve got the right set-up - is getting a next gen upgrade next February for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X. 
It promises to bring stable 60fps performance, private lobbies and updated liveries for the 2021 GT World Challenge series, and there&#x27;ll be a free update path for owners of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to their respective next-gen upgrades. 
Assetto Corsa Competizione first came out on PC in 2018, with its sole purpose being to replicate the GT World Challenge series (the series formerly known as Blancpain GT), which sees the Spa 24 Hours as its centrepiece. The initial console port was decent if lacking in some areas - areas which this next gen update would seem to address.

                    <span>A new debate has erupted surrounding Steam&#x27;s two-hour refund policy. 
If you weren&#x27;t aware, Steam offers a refund for all game purchases, no questions asked, as long as your playtime is less than two hours and it&#x27;s within two weeks of purchase. 
It&#x27;s a ‌pro-consumer policy (or a cost-effective way to reduce the number of customer service staff, depending on who you ask), and the two-hour playtime threshold is intended to stop less trustworthy consumers from exploiting it.

The real-life McCree was one of several men apparently pictured posing together on a bed with a photo of disgraced US comedian Bill Cosby. The disturbing picture allegedly showed the interior of the &quot;Cosby suite&quot; - a hotel room once used at BlizzCon for partying.

                    <span>True to its word, Netflix has added a first batch of mobile games to its streaming service, albeit as part of a Poland-only test to begin with.
Reports of Netflix&#x27;s plans to enter the world of video games began to circulate in May, and the company finally made it official in July, saying it was &quot;in the early stages of further expanding into games&quot; and that it viewed gaming &quot;as another new content category for us.&quot;
It also clarified it would initially focus on mobile games, with a later report suggesting the first batch of these titles would launch as part of Netflix&#x27;s subscription service some time next year.

                    <span>Square Enix&#x27;s previously Switch-exclusive JRPG sequel Bravely Default 2 is making its way to Steam early next month, on 2nd September.
Bravely Default 2 - the follow-up to 3DS JRPGs Bravely Default and Bravely Second: End Layer, which released in 2012 and 2015 respectively - launched on Switch back in February this year, charting the adventures of a new band of heroes on the continent of Excillant.
Its story begins when young sailor Seth washes onto the shores of one of the continent&#x27;s five regions. He eventually joins forces with Gloria - a princess forced to flee her own kingdom - alongside travelling scholar Elvis and the mercenary Adelle, for a familiar blend of narrative-driven exploration and turn-based combat built around the series&#x27; Brave/Default mechanic, which essentially lets players strategically bank turns to unleash in one massive blast later on.

                    <span>Following reports back in July that open-world zombies-and-parkour survival hit Dying Light would be making its way to Switch, developer Techland has now made it official.
Dying Light has been a massive success for Techland - the developer says the game has now been played by over 20 million players since its launch back in 2015 - and it&#x27;s received an absolute stack of DLC, both free and paid, over the years as a result (and, of course, a sequel is due on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox this December).
All that DLC was bundled together for a special Platinum Edition of Dying Light on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox earlier in 2021, and it&#x27;s this version that&#x27;s now been confirmed to be making its way to Switch at some currently undisclosed future point.

                    <span>September is almost upon us, meaning a fresh batch of Games With Gold titles to download for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, this time including Zone of the Enders HD Collection, Warhammer: Chaosbane, and more.
First out the gate is Zone of the Enders HD Collection for Xbox 360, which will be available as part of Games with Gold between 1st September and 15th September. Initially release in 2012 (where it was infamously so poor it ended up getting an extensive patch from an entirely different porting studio), it features high-definition remasters of the Hideo-Kojima-produced Zone of the Enders and Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner, each serving up a celebrated blend of mech-based third-person shooting and hack-and-slash action.
From 1st September to 15th September, Games with Gold subscribers can download Warhammer: Chaosbane, a Diablo-esque fantasy action-RPG set in the middle of Warhammer&#x27;s Old World history. Players can take on the role of human, high elf, wood elf, or a dwarf as they batter their way through familiar locations - including the cursed city of Praag and Nuln, the old capital of the Empire - in their ceaseless quest for shiny loot. And who doesn&#x27;t love loot?

                    <span>A new Gamescom trailer released last night has given us our best look yet at House of Ashes, the third game in Supermassive&#x27;s The Dark Pictures Anthology. 
The trailer also includes a hidden URL (scribbled on a piece of card visible at the 1:24 mark) which leads to a mock US military website full of extra lore details on House of Ashes&#x27; story.
The only downside to that trailer? A big ol&#x27; advert for the game&#x27;s &quot;Pazuzu Edition&quot; comes right at the end, showing a highly-detailed figurine of the game&#x27;s monster. The creature is something trailers have so far only teased, and while this isn&#x27;t the first time this advert has been shown, it&#x27;s still jarring to see it plonked at the end. Oh well.

                    <span>Some of eFootball&#x27;s new gameplay mechanics, animations and even kicks won&#x27;t be in at launch, Konami has confirmed.
The publisher today showed off gameplay for eFootball - what was once PES - with a new trailer, below, and confirmed a handful of new mechanics and gameplay features that won&#x27;t be available until some future update.
For example, the new control ball trapping feature is only available post-launch. &quot;Loads of dribbles and body feints are also available with intuitive commands,&quot; Konami said. &quot;These make every duel an exciting moment for both attacker and defender.&quot;

Watson, who led the Saints Row 2 patch project at Volition, died yesterday after a long battle with cancer.
In May, Watson&#x27;s illness caused him to step down from his position as Volition community manager, although he continued to work on the Saints Row 2 patch project.

                    <span>The game&#x27;s pandemic era 80m interaction range will now become the game&#x27;s &quot;base&quot; interaction level globally, the developer said. (Pre-pandemic, it was 40m.)

                    <span>Sifu, the martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, finally has a release date and will release for PlayStation and PC on 22nd February next year.
Sifu is a a third-person, single-player action game, focussed on &quot;intense hand-to-hand combat&quot;, that follows a young Kung Fu student on a path of revenge as he hunts down his family&#x27;s murderers with nothing but a mysterious pendant and, possibly, the ability to palm-smash someone&#x27;s nose out the back of their head.
Actually that&#x27;s not quite true; as players make their way through Sifu&#x27;s world - &quot;from the gang-ridden suburbs to the cold hallways of the corporate towers&quot; - they&#x27;re encouraged to use everything at their disposal to overcome the odds and hunt down their targets, whether that be throwable objects or makeshift weapons strewn around the environment.

Announced last summer, the moodily atmospheric Jett casts players as scout and &#x27;anchorite&#x27; Mei as she becomes the first person to explore a mythic ocean planet in order to &quot;carve out a future for a people haunted by oblivion&quot; and search for something called &quot;the hymnwave&quot;.

Tonight&#x27;s pre-show began with King of Fighters 15, which launches 17th February 2022, Bus Simulator 2021, which turns up 7th September, and Nobody Saves The World from Guacamelee developer Drinkbox Studios, coming early 2022.
We also got our best look yet at House of Ashes, the third Dark Pictures Anthology game coming on 22nd October, and its monster, which you can get as a plastic statue.

                    <span>Microsoft has released a new Age of Empires 4 trailer.
The video, below, includes snippets of the strategy game in action, but not as much as I had hoped to see at Gamescom Opening Night Live.
What we do get is a look at the Holy Roman Empire and the Rus civilisations, the final two of eight launch civs to be shown off. The other six are the English, Mongols, Chinese, Delhi Sultanate, Abbasid Dynasty and the French.

                    <span>Following a succession over-the-top adventures that folded in alien invasions and superpowers with Saints Row 4 and its subsequent follow-ups, Volition is bringing its open world crime series back to its roots with the next year&#x27;s Saints Row - a reboot that reintroduces a more grounded contemporary fictional setting while still looking to hold onto the humour and possibilities that Saints Row has become beloved for. 
Titled simply Saints Row, the new game will be a cross-generational affair that&#x27;s coming as soon as next February, and sees a player-created character heading up a gang of four as they go on to establish a criminal empire. Among that group is Eli, a nerdy planner with an MBA, Neenah, who provides the driving talent and Kevin, who, er, has some lovely abs? Then there&#x27;s the player character themselves, defined by the player using some of the same deep customisation options seen previously in the series - and the group&#x27;s make-up promises to play into the co-op that is also at the heart of this Saints Row reboot. 
Providing the playground this time out is Santo Ileso, which draws heavily upon the American south west. It&#x27;s broken down into nine distinct districts, including the downbeat Rancho Providencio, Las Vegas analogue El Dorado and the secluded suburban Monte Vista. In the heart of the city there&#x27;s an extended emphasis on verticality (and the promise of some tools to make the most of all that, with wingsuits and ziplines that catapult players into the air).

                    <span>Frontier Developments&#x27; dino-park management sim sequel Jurassic World Evolution 2 will be stomping onto Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 9th November.
Players familiar with the original 2018 game should be immediately at home with Evolution 2, which once again tasks budding managers with building and maintaining their own dinosaur theme park, laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and, of course, making sure the attractions don&#x27;t eat the guests.
It&#x27;s not all business as usual though; Jurassic World Evolution 2 shifts the action away from the exclusively tropical setting of Muertes Archipelago, as seen in the first game, and gives players the chance to build their parks across a diverse range of new environments - from dense forests to scorched deserts - each with unique environmental challenges, including bespoke weather such as sandstorms and snow.

In other Horizon news, the PS5 version of Horizon Zero Dawn has today been updated with a 60fps mode. This patch has just gone live, and should be available to download now.

The Skywalker Saga, an all-new retelling of Lucasfilm&#x27;s nine Star Wars films built in a new engine, was announced at E3 2019 for a late 2020 release. However, it&#x27;s now seen two delays - the most recent in April this year - leaving many to wonder when it would finally resurface.
And the answer, of course, is today, with Opening Night Live serving up a fresh look at The Skywalker Saga in a brand-new trailer blending cutscenes and gameplay of familiar moments from right across the Star Wars nonology, all given a typically comedic Lego game twist.

It&#x27;s difficult not to be impressed by the visual flair and ambition on-screen, as characters run, ride, glide and drive around its beautiful world. 
I&#x27;m less impressed by its monsters - a collection of oddball creatures which in turn look like animals, robots or piñatas. It&#x27;s also unclear exactly how battles will work - they look real-time, with items and weaponry seemingly summoned out of thin air.

Season 0 for the free-to-play Halo meets Portal shooter includes a new battle pass with 100 levels, new seasonal challenges and rewards, a new map, and new modes. Trailer is below:
The new mode is called Contamination. Here, the contaminated player equips only a melee weapon and contaminates as many other players as possible by killing them, ending the round when all other players become infected. Players who become contaminated then spawn and switch sides, garnering points for contaminating as many players as they can. Uninfected players equip a shotgun and earn points by killing as many contaminated players as they can.

                    <span>You might&#x27;ve heard the rumours of a &quot;Marvel XCOM&quot;, coming from tactics specialist Firaxis, and turns out: they&#x27;re mostly true. During Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live stream, the studio revealed Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, described as a &quot;tactical RPG&quot; - although from talking to creative director Jake Solomon, it&#x27;s quite a bit less XCOM-y than some of those tweets and reddit threads may have led you to believe. 
So, what&#x27;s it all about? Midnight Suns is set in the &quot;darker side of the Marvel Universe&quot;, based on a &#x27;90s comic book series called Rise of the Midnight Sons - although apparently it&#x27;s deliberately not an exact retelling of those events. The setup for the game is this: perpetual baddies Hydra have revived someone called Lilith, who does a bit of dead-raising that threatens to overrun the Avengers (Iron Man, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Dr. Strange, and Wolverine can be spotted in the trailer). The Avengers call up a few extra supernatural mates to help out, called the Midnight Suns, which includes Nico Minoru, Blade, Magik, and Ghost Rider, and a few more (12 Marvel heroes in total), and together they then resurrect some help of their own: one more hero, newly created for the game, called the Hunter, who&#x27;s also Lilith&#x27;s child and apparently the only one able to kill her.
The Hunter, who&#x27;s customisable (in &quot;appearance&quot; and also in terms of a choice of about 40 different abilities), is who you&#x27;ll be playing as, which is where things immediately depart from the XCOM formula. You&#x27;ll be controlling both the Hunter and the other heroes in combat, with battles featuring three heroes total at a time, but then the time between battles is spent in one of two ways: managing your base, a mystical safehouse called the Abbey - so far so XCOM - or actually walking around the Abbey in third-person, over-the-shoulder view, exploring its &quot;extensive&quot; grounds and interacting with the other heroes.

                    <span>Persona 5&#x27;s Morgana is the latest playable character coming to Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz, Sega has announced, as paid-for post-launch DLC.
Tonight&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live trailer for the game showed off the game&#x27;s new feline addition (though also stated his voiceover and background music aren&#x27;t in the game). 
We also got a brief glimpse at the 12 party games included in Banana Blitz. (Don&#x27;t worry, Target is of course there.) The full list includes Monkey Target, Baseball, Tennis, Racing, Fight, Bowling, Golf, Billiards, Soccer, Shot, Boat and Dogfighting.

                    <span>Hot on the heels of Halo Infinite&#x27;s release date announcement, Microsoft has released a new video for the game, and revealed a Halo Infinite-themed Xbox Series X and a new Halo-themed controller.
First up, the video. Microsoft showed off Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer season 1 cinematic intro, which reveals Commander Agryna. Here&#x27;s the official blurb:
&quot;Humanity&#x27;s forces are scattered. Desperate resistance efforts have continued to fall short on multiple fronts, from Cortana&#x27;s relentless martial law to the expanding power and ambition of Atriox and the Banished. But there is hope: a new generation of Spartans, training in secret to become unstoppable. In this cinematic introduction to Season 1 of Halo Infinite multiplayer, get a glimpse into the Academy Commander&#x27;s own heroic journey and what it truly means to be a Spartan.&quot;

                    <span>Tarsier Studio&#x27;s deliciously sinister platform horror Little Nightmares 2 is getting a little spookier today on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, courtesy of a free Enhanced Edition update.
Little Nightmares 2&#x27;s Enhanced Edition aims to give the already richly atmospheric experience - which follows the adventures of new protagonist Mono and returning character Six through the grim streets of Pale City - an even moodier boost with a range of primarily visual enhancements.
There&#x27;s ray-traced reflections, for starters, bringing live reflections to Little Nightmare&#x27;s various shiny surfaces, as well as improved volumetric shadows - which, as publisher Bandai Namco explains in its announcement post, &quot;add even more depth and detail to every object and enhance how rays of light are interrupted by moving objects&quot;.

                    <span>A year late and without a number of key features, Halo Infinite will finally arrive for PC and Xbox on 8th December. 
Microsoft is due to make the news official tonight, as part of Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live Show, but it slipped out a little early thanks to a scrubbed Microsoft Store listing which The Verge has subsequently verified. 
(Apologies to all those waiting until the end of last night&#x27;s Xbox Gamescom livestream.)

                    <span>The Lord of the Rings: Rise to War launches 23rd September for all of Europe, America, Oceania and Southeast Asia.
This mobile game is the work of NetEase Games, the Chinese company working with Blizzard on mobile game Diablo Immortal, and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. It&#x27;s an officially-licensed mobile strategy game based on J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s books and Peter Jackson&#x27;s movies.
In the game you build armies and expand territories as you search for the One Ring. It&#x27;s set in the Third Age of Middle-earth (the one in which the Lord of the Rings trilogy is set), and includes famous franchise characters such as Aragorn and Elrond.

                    <span>Destiny 2 PC players may notice an impact to their game&#x27;s performance following the recent addition of anti-cheat software, Bungie has warned. 
BattlEye was added to Destiny 2 last night as part of the game&#x27;s 3.3.0 update. Alongside this, Bungie published a security update blog detailing its arrival - and what it may mean for performance.
&quot;Anti-cheat solutions require some additional system resources to keep watch and you may see some reduction in frames and performance after Update 3.3.0 goes live,&quot; Bungie wrote. &quot;The new service will also increase the initial startup of the game.&quot;

                    <span>The State of California has beefed up its legal battle with Activision Blizzard, and accused the firm&#x27;s HR department of shredding documents related to staff complaints and internal investigations.
These documents, California says, should have been kept pending its own legal investigation (thanks, Axios). 
The state has also criticised Activision Blizzard for enforcing NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) which have hampered staff efforts to speak out, and for involving third-party legal firm WilmerHale to investigate - something California says &quot;directly interferes&quot; with its own efforts.

This Akuma, from Street Fighter 5, hits the Nintendo Switch exclusive on 27th August via layered armour offered as an event quest reward.
The video below gives you an idea of how Akuma will play. Many of his fighting game special moves are present and correct, including his fireball, dragon punch, spinning kick and punch slam. He&#x27;s got his critical art from Street Fighter 5, and his trademark Metsu pose.

I&#x27;ve already reported how the cyberpunk twin-stick shooter&#x27;s latest patch negatively affected the Windows 10 version of the game, with stuttering, poor framerate and other technical struggles experienced by players.
I&#x27;m in the same boat. I&#x27;m playing The Ascent via Xbox Game Pass on PC, and therefore the Windows 10 version, and ever since the recently-released patch came out, it&#x27;s been pretty much unplayable.

At a high level, netflow data creates a picture of traffic flow and volume across a network. It can show which server communicated with another, information that may ordinarily only be available to the server owner or the ISP carrying the traffic. Crucially, this data can be used for, among other things, tracking traffic through virtual private networks, which are used to mask where someone is connecting to a server from, and by extension, their approximate physical location...</span>

                    <span>Square Enix&#x27;s series of Final Fantasy pixel remasters continues on 8th September with the arrival of Final Fantasy 4 on Steam and mobile devices. 
&quot;In Final Fantasy 4&quot;, explains Square, &quot;The Kingdom of Baron sends their elite airship fleet, the Red Wings, to attack the surrounding countries. Distressed by his mission, Cecil, a dark knight and captain of the Red Wings, decides to fight against the tyrannical Baron with his trusted friend and his paramour at his side.&quot;
Final Fantasy 4&#x27;s pixel remaster follows similar releases for the first three games, bringing updated 2D pixel character and background art, a rearranged soundtrack (overseen by original composer Nobuo Uematsu), improved gameplay, and a range of quality of life additions.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve finally wrapped up every last challenge from Sea of Thieves&#x27; utterly stupendous Pirates of the Caribbean story expansion and are in need of new adventure, Rare has a fresh batch of chaos for players to embark on, courtesy of a new Borderlands-themed collaboration event.
Sea of Thieves&#x27; newly announced Making Mayhem event is, as its name suggest, all about causing a ruckus out on the waves, challenging players to earn Favour with the Bilge Rats by completing a range of different (and largely explosion-focussed) activities. 
Minor Mayhem challenges give pirates the opportunity to earning a &quot;fair&quot; amount of Favour by doing things like detonating Gunpowder Skeletons in a chain reaction or destroying a Ghost Ship, while Major Mayhem challenges are considerably more lucrative. A &quot;good&quot; amount of Favour can be earned by opening one of the Gold Hoarders&#x27; Treasure Vaults, for instance, and other activities, such as completing a Tall Tale, reward a &quot;huge&quot; amount of Favour.

                    <span>Publisher Team17 and developer Drop Bear Bytes have joined forces to bring Australia-themed post-apocalyptic cRPG Broken Roads to Steam and consoles next year.
Broken Roads tasks players, and their accompanying party of up to five characters, with traversing a &quot;content-rich and densely-crafted&quot; post-apocalyptic future version of Western Australia, visiting real-life locations along the way. The experience is - as even a quick glance at the trailer below will confirm - heavily inspired by classic single-player cRPGs, and features a blend of turn-based tactical combat, alongside &quot;traditional and original&quot; RPG mechanics.
There&#x27;s a &quot;classless&quot; character system, offering &quot;nearly unlimited...development options&quot;, and something Drop Bear calls the Moral Compass. Acting as a kind of enhanced morality system, this sees dialogue options and questing decisions influence - and be influenced by - a character&#x27;s philosophical leanings, with the game featuring four philosophical paths, each with their own unique traits.: Humanist, Utilitarian, Machiavellian, and Nihilist.

                    <span>Microsoft has broadcast its big Xbox Gamescom livestream, which gave us a good look at Forza Horizon 5 but notably skipped all mention of Halo Infinite. 
The show started with another look at Dying Light 2, and a sunset-drenched &quot;modern dark ages&quot; post-apocalypse full of parkour gameplay. Techland&#x27;s long-awaited sequel arrives 7th December.
Next up was an extended look at Microsoft Flight Simulator with the chatty Jorg Neumann, who talked more about the game&#x27;s upcoming sixth world update covering Germany, Austria and Switzerland which is due on 7th September.

                    <span>Playground Games has shown off the typically spectacular intro sequence for Forza Horizon 5 in a new gameplay video, confirming the game&#x27;s cover cars as it did so - but had little in terms of concrete new detail to share on the open-world racing game.
The sequence sees the player air-dropped from a cargo plane, by parachute, in a series of signature cars, all over the game&#x27;s Mexico map.
First up is a 2021 Ford Bronco Badlands, a rugged, retro-styled SUV that is dropped right next to a smouldering volcano crater, dusted with snow. It&#x27;s winter up here, but a vertiginous descent takes us down into a baking desert and a brief glimpse of a Baja rallying circuit.

                    <span>UPDATE: 24/8/21: Following the recent discovery of a console listing for Crusader Kings 3 on the Taiwan ratings board website, developer Paradox Interactive has made it official: the superb medieval grand strategy game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass.
The console version is being developed in conjunction with Lab42 and promises to &quot;utilise key capabilities&quot; of the Xbox Series X/S and PS5, &quot;like super-fast load times for a seamless gameplay experience&quot;.
&quot;Xbox Series X/S players will be able to quickly switch between gameplay and consulting a YouTube tutorial on how to quell a peasant revolt,&quot; Paradox says in its announcement. &quot;PlayStation 5 users will experience the game&#x27;s stress mechanics themselves, as their DualSense controllers physically react to in-game events as they unfold.&quot;

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot happening in developer Adobo&#x27;s stupendous Microsoft Flight Simulator between now and the end of the year, starting with Septembers&#x27;s makeover for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. That, however, is just the beginning, with the developer having now confirmed two new aircraft, plus a competitive multiplayer mode arriving this autumn.
World Update 6, as we already knew, arrives on 7th September and aims to drastically enhance Flight Simulator&#x27;s rendition of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Alongside visual upgrades, it&#x27;ll introduce around 100 famous handcrafted landmarks, four new airports - Lübeck, Stuttgart, Klagenfurt and St. Galle - plus new discovery flights, landing challenges, bush trips, and more.
That &quot;and more&quot; was elaborated on during tonight&#x27;s Xbox Gamescom Showcase, and takes the form of a new pilotable plane: the Junkers JU-52. This 1930s German aircraft arrives as part of a new series of paid DLC Asobo is calling Local Legends, introducing new planes well-known in the local area of each World Update, but which are perhaps less well-known to a worldwide audience. The Junkers JU-52 arrives on 7th September and will cost $14.99 USD.

                    <span>Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One get cloud gaming this Christmas, Microsoft has announced.
During its Gamescom 2021 Xbox stream, Microsoft said Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members will get access to over 100 games from the cloud on the consoles.
This has the added benefit of letting you play games before you install them. Microsoft uses the example of Sea of Thieves, and the ability to jump into a multiplayer game with friends as soon as you get an invite - and without having to wait for an install.

                    <span>Join us this evening to watch Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Gamescom livestream, which is due to begin at 6pm UK time (that&#x27;s 1pm Eastern, or 10am Pacific).
This is the first of two major events to mark another all-digital Gamescom. The second - Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live - comes tomorrow, at 7pm UK.
For now, Microsoft has said to expect 90 minutes of updates on upcoming Xbox games but &quot;no new reveals or major surprises&quot;. No Major Nelson?! But, surely, now is the time for us to hear a Halo Infinite release date.

                    <span>Word of potential layoffs was originally picked up last month by GamesIndustry.biz, with at least nine of 61 employees thought to be affected - primarily narrative writers and designers.
Now, a report by The Independent has shed new light on the situation - with &quot;dozens&quot; of staff said to have been placed at risk of losing their jobs, just weeks after concerns were raised regarding various in-game storylines.

This store listing details the new destination coming to Destiny 2 alongside the expansion, as well as an all-new weapon type. If you&#x27;d prefer to watch Bungie dole out this information later, here&#x27;s your last chance to look away.

                    <span>Sega has announced an indefinite delay to the physical release of Sonic Colours: Ultimate in Europe.
The holdup applies to both standard and keyring editions of the game - the latter of which includes a Baby Sonic keychain. Digital versions of the game are unaffected and arrive as planned on 7th September.
Sega blamed the delay on &quot;unforeseen logistical issues&quot;, and said it would affect all EMEA markets excluding Australia and New Zealand.

                    <span>Asterix and Obelix are readying for some fisticuffs in developer Mr Nutz Studio&#x27;s striking 2D beat &#x27;em up Asterix &amp; Obelix: Slap them All!, which is now confirmed for a PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC release on 25th November.
Slap them All! unfolds in the Roman-occupied Gaul, circa 50 BC, where, as publisher Micriods puts it, &quot;Only one small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders.&quot;
Those Gauls, of course, include Asterix and Obelix, who players will be able to control as they journey (either solo or with a friend via local co-op) across iconic locations from the comic books, battling Roman legionaries, pirates, brigands, &quot;and even the dreaded Normans&quot;. The ensuring hand-animated adventure, as you&#x27;ll see in the trailer below, looks glorious.

                    <span>Voxel vacation adventure (and Digital Foundry favourite) The Touryst - developed by Shin&#x27;en Multimedia, the team behind acclaimed Switch racer Fast RMX - is making its way to PlayStation on 9th September, according to a new listing on the PlayStation Store.
Details regarding the PlayStation version are limited - there&#x27;s a release date and description and that&#x27;s about it - but The Touryst (which debuted on Switch in 2019 before heading to Xbox and PC the following year) remains a fun little excursion, depositing players on the glorious Monument Islands holiday resort for a spot of sun, sea, and exploration-driven adventure.
On a basic level, the goal is to progress from island to island - all rendered with an appealing, retro-inspired voxel art style, and each with its own theme - in order to infiltrate the mysterious monuments strewn around and solve the mix of puzzles and platform challenges within.

                    <span>Paradox Interactive could soon be bringing its superb medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 to consoles according to a newly uncovered listing by the Taiwanese ratings board.
As spotted by Gematsu, three relevant listings (seemingly now removed) have found their way onto the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee&#x27;s website; one for Crusader Kings 3 on PlayStation 5, one for the game on Xbox Series X/S, and another for Xbox One.
Of course, nothing is official until Paradox makes it so, but the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee has good form when it comes to leaking game announcements ahead of time, with everything from Crash Bandicoot 4 to last year BioShock ports for Switch having appeared on its website prior to their official unveilings.

                    <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey players on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 will soon be able to hurtle across ancient Greece at 60fps, courtesy of a new game update releasing tomorrow, 24th August.
In its current form, Odyssey retains the 30fps limit seen on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro when playing on Sony and Microsoft&#x27;s newest consoles via backward compatibility, meaning players are in for an extremely welcome 100% frame rate boost when the update arrives.
According to Ubisoft&#x27;s announcement post, that&#x27;ll happen at 7am tomorrow, 24th August, in the UK. Meanwhile, those that set their watches to Pacific Daylight Time won&#x27;t have to roll into a new day - it&#x27;s out tonight, 23rd August, at 11pm PDT.

                    <span>Konami has signed a deal with the Major League Soccer Players Association to grant rights to use all their players in upcoming football game eFootball.
It&#x27;s a slightly odd announcement, given it mentions the players only, as opposed to having the league also officially licensed. Perhaps this means the MLS players will be free agents in the game.
The trailer, below, shows LA Galaxy&#x27;s Jonathan Dos Santos expressing his delight at the news.

                    <span>Final paychecks are now being sent to Kingdoms of Amalur staff members, nine years after developer 38 Studios was shut down. 
Company mismanagement and poor sales of the ambitious RPG meant 38 Studios collapsed shortly after it became clear Kingdoms of Amalur was not going to be a World of Warcraft-style hit.
This left nearly 400 developers adrift, and waiting for their final paycheck - until now. A new report from Bloomberg [paywall] states staff are now belatedly receiving their last pay packet - albeit just a fraction of what they were owed (thanks GamesIndustry.biz).

Capcom&#x27;s action series began life on 23rd August 2001, with the release of Devil May Cry on PlayStation 2.
It was directed by legendary developer Hideki Kamiya, now at Platinum Games (check out Martin&#x27;s Kamiya profile from 2013), and stars Dante, a stylish demon hunter famous for his white hair, big swords and signature handguns, Ebony &amp; Ivory.

                    <span>Hades is currently the best-rated game for PS5 and Xbox Series X on Metacritic.
Although the indie roguelike was only released for current-gen consoles last week, it&#x27;s surpassed every single competitor released on the new consoles since they debuted back in 2020, securing a top aggregated Metacritic score of 94 on Xbox Series X and 93 on PS5. 
Given the hundreds of titles that have been released on PS5 and Xbox Series X thus far it&#x27;s an incredible achievement, not least because for the former, Hades has secured an aggregate score higher than games like Demon&#x27;s Souls (92) and Borderlands 3 (91). On Xbox, on the other hand, it&#x27;s topped Ori and the Will of the Wisps (92) and Microsoft Flight Simulator (90) (thanks, TwistedVoxel).

Using the hashtag #ADayOffTwitch, the protesters hope that by refusing to log on and create - or even spectate - Twitch streams on 1st September, it&#x27;ll hit the company&#x27;s purse and compel it to listen, and better support, the creators who suffer regularly from &quot;hate raids&quot; and organised attacks. 
The idea for the boycott comes from Rek It Raven, LuciaEverBlack, and Shineypen (thanks, PC Gamer), and together, they&#x27;re trying to convince other Twitch streamers and viewers to do the same.

In an interview with Total Film, Isaac talked about his current commitments, which include the Metal Gear Solid film from director Jordan Vogt-Roberts. 
&quot;I just loved the game,&quot; Isaac said (thanks, GamesRadar+, via NME). &quot;I love the feeling that the game would give me every time I&#x27;d play. It&#x27;s just a strangely isolated, mournful, lonely game to play that has these incredible moments of violence and terror, with these weird, psychedelic concepts and villains. But, yes, it&#x27;s kind of like psychedelic military horror things that happen.

                    <span>American McGee has unveiled the full story of Alice: Asylum, the third instalment of Mysterious Studios&#x27; fantastically grim take on Alice in Wonderland. 
Succeeding 2011&#x27;s Alice: Madness Returns, Alice: Asylum is part of McGee&#x27;s unique &quot;crowd design process&quot; and has been drawn up in consultation with his 3000+ Patreon backers.
&quot;This is it. At last... the Alice: Asylum Narrative Outline is available for you to download, read, and join in helping Crowd Design,&quot; McGee said on Patreon, attaching the game&#x27;s full narrative outline as written by himself and Alex Crowley. It was seemingly only finalised on 20th August.

                    <span>A performance patch for Resident Evil Village on Steam is rolling out next week.
In a brief tweet on the developer&#x27;s official social media channels, Capcom said this update - the second in the developer&#x27;s fight to stabilise the horror game on PC - fixes an issue where &quot;certain&quot; unspecified CPUs were &quot;unable to launch the game&quot;, as well as the &quot;minor fine-tuning of certain graphical processes&quot;, although what, exactly, graphical processes the update will address. 
A few weeks back, hackers hit the headlines by insisting that the stuttering and dropped framerates experienced by players on PC were caused by the game&#x27;s own anti-piracy measures - something Digital Foundry was able to test and prove, too.

                    <span>The Titanic Mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven aims to put the RMS Titanic in Mafia - the team is working towards making &quot;one of the most detailed and accurate free 3D recreations of the Titanic ever made&quot;, with players able to explore the ship in freeroam mode.
Emma reported on the mod in July, speaking with lead developer and maritime engineer from the Netherlands, Robin Bongaarts. Bongaarts has been working on the project since September 2006, and finally now a portion of it has been released.
It&#x27;s worth noting part one does not include the sinking of the Titanic. This is planned for a later release. Nor does it include a fully-fleshed out storyline, or the full interior of the ship itself.

                    <span>Remember The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run? The formative 18-year-old adventure hasn&#x27;t aged well, but what if it was remade using the latest graphics tech?
New Zealand-based Unreal tinkerer and YouTuber Reuben &quot;Reubs&quot; Ward decided to challenge himself to to just that - well, the game&#x27;s first mission, anyway - in just a week.
The video below runs through the creation process, and it&#x27;s fascinating stuff. With the help of some nifty programs and an AI-powered texture upscaler, Reubs was able to get game&#x27;s map up and running in Unreal 5, as well as Homer, a few NPCs, collectibles, and even vehicles. There&#x27;s ray tracing for that fancy lighting, too, and of course the Duff Blimp flying overhead.

                    <span>Warner Bros. will show Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga for the first time in a year at gamescom next week.
Geoff Keighley tweeted to say gamescom Opening Night Live, which kicks off at 7pm UK time on Wednesday, will feature a new look at Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.
The last time we saw the game in action was August 2020, with the gameplay trailer, below:

                    <span>A modder has completely rebalanced Cyberpunk 2077 in a bid to improve the gameplay experience.
Prolific Cyberpunk modder Scissors123454321 released their gameplay rebalance megamod today on NexusMods, and it makes a huge number of changes to the balance of the game.
Perhaps the headline change is the removal of scaling. In the base Cyberpunk, V and their enemies gain stats as you level up. This means, without any upgrades, V ends up much weaker than enemies at the level 50 cap than they are at level one.

                    <span>Players of The Ascent have reported a number of problems with its most recently-released patch.
This week, developer Neon Giant released an update (2.1.4.0) for The Ascent on Xbox and Windows 10 platforms that was meant to bring parity with the Steam version. That is, it included DLSS support for Windows 10 (and, as a result, the Game Pass on PC version), as well as co-op, stability and mission fixes.
However, players have reported that this patch has negatively affected the cyberpunk-themed twin-stick shooter, including hits to framerate, stuttering and asset loading problems.

                    <span>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector will get new factions, a veterancy system and more new features in a future update, its developer has said.
The well-received Blood Angels versus Tyranids turn-based strategy game launched on PC last month and, as someone who has finished the campaign and dipped their toe into skirmish mode, it&#x27;s in dire need of new factions and more variety.
In a post on Steam, developer Black Lab Games said new factions are coming. In fact, this is the most common request from players.

The two much-loved modes of play have been delayed. Campaign co-op won&#x27;t hit the shooter until season two at the earliest, which means about three months after launch.
User creation tool Forge, meanwhile, won&#x27;t hit the game until season three at the earliest - or about six months after launch.

                    <span>Wild, the promising PlayStation-exclusive open-world survival adventure from Wild Sheep Studio, is reportedly no longer in development.
Announced back in 2014 for release on PS4, Wild was due to be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment with Rayman and Beyond Good &amp; Evil creator Michel Ancel at the helm - until the famed designer announced his retirement from the games industry in 2020.
Wild only properly surfaced one more time following its announcement - at Paris Games Week in 2015 - and gameplay details remain limited to his day. We do know, however, that players, in the role of a shaman, could possess and play as a variety of wild animals - including a bear, eagle, and snake - and call on the help of deities as they explored the vast, prehistoric world.

                    <span>Fans of cult classic adventure series Syberia can soon reunite with protagonist Kate Walker on a brand-new adventure - this one &quot;across continents and through time periods&quot; - when a fourth instalment, The World Before, comes to PC on 10th September.
The original Syberia, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, released all the way back in 2002, quickly charming adventure game fans with its gently surreal story of a New York lawyer dispatched to deal with the sale of a former automaton factory hidden in the French Alps.
An equally well-regarded sequel followed two years later, but it took a further 15 years for Walker&#x27;s adventures to continue. Unfortunately, 2017&#x27;s Syberia 3 was generally considered to be a bit of a dud - plagued by technical problems and flawed design - leaving many to assume its poor reception would mark the end of the series.

                    <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator&#x27;s next big geographical makeover - this time for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland - has been delayed from its original 24th August release date and is now expected to arrive a little later on 7th September.
Originally announced in June, Flight Simulator&#x27;s sixth World Update - which follows similar enhancements for Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the United States - introduces new aerials and elevation maps for Germany, Austria, and Germany, alongside new photogrammetry cities, four hand-crafted airports, and nearly 100 points of interest.
Previous reveals from developer Asobo have confirmed three of those airports - Klagenfurt Airport (LOWK)
Lübeck Airport (EDHL), and St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport (LSZR) - plus a number of new landmarks, including Castle Marienburg in Hanover, Holstentor in Lübeck, Deutches Eck in Koblenz, Castle Katz in St. Goarshausen, Munich&#x27;s Allianz Arena, and the Riesenrad in Vienna.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a little over two years since publisher THQ Nordic announced a new Saints Row title was &quot;deep in development&quot; at series studio Volition, and finally it seems the silence around the game is about to be broken, if a tantalising new tease is anything to go by.
The tease in question comes courtesy of noted presenter and producer Geoff Keighley, who shared some intriguing art on Twitter earlier today - featuring a heavily graffitied wall adorned with the word &#x27;Rebooting&#x27; and, crucially, the Saints&#x27; beloved fleur-de-lis emblem.
The same image has now appeared on the official Saints Row Twitter feed and website - just in case their were any lingering doubts about its connection to the series - meaning the only real question left to ask at this juncture regarding what would be the first numbered Saints Row title to release since 2015 is, &#x27;When will we learn more?&#x27;.

                    <span>We&#x27;re used to football clubs announcing new signings with a nod to video games - but this latest effort may be the best yet.
Spanish La Liga club Real Betis announced the signing of Argentinian defender Germán Pezzella with a video called GTA 4: Real Betis Edition.
In the video, striker Aitor Rubial walks to the club&#x27;s stadium, the Estadio Benito Villamarín, with the camera aping the GTA perspective, and with a walk befitting Niko Bellic himself. The music is a good fit, and there&#x27;s even a GTA-style user interface, complete with mini-map.

                    <span>Black Myth: Wukong just got a new 12-minute gameplay video and the game continues to look great.
Black Myth: Wukong, the Chinese-made action game based on Journey to the West that took the internet by storm back in August 2020, has now moved over to Unreal Engine 5, Hangzhou-based developer Game Science Studio confirmed.
In fact, the video is recorded real-time in Unreal Engine 5 and &quot;supported&quot; by Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS technology. Black Myth: Wukong is the first Unreal Engine 5 game to feature DLSS, Nvidia said.

The video, below, from People Make Games&#x27; Quintin Smith, reveals Roblox&#x27;s shady exchange system, which, it claims, makes it incredibly hard for developers to make money from the platform.
The video also runs through how Roblox, which has 200 million monthly users, encourages young game developers to work incredibly hard with unreasonable expectations of success.

Aeon Must Die hit the headlines last year after starring in a much-watched Sony PlayStation State of Play broadcast.
The trailer for the game shown during the August 2020 State of Play, below, depicts a visually arresting beat-&#x27;em-up that caught the attention of PlayStation fans.

                    <span>In a series first, the upcoming Halo Infinite has bots. And not just any bots - as I reported, Halo Infinite&#x27;s bots aren&#x27;t messing about.
Developer 343 used the recent Halo Infinite technical preview to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance. To that end, the technical preview debuted with the Bot Arena playlist, which put four players against four bots on arena maps.
As 343 pushed the bot difficulty lever over the course of the technical preview weekend, the AI became more deadly. These bots were accurate, aggressive and ruthless. They would come in for a well-timed melee hit after dropping your shield. They would dodge grenades. They used grenades well and often. They picked up power weapons and they were not afraid to use them.

                    <span>In this post, I’ll collect links on Apple’s iPhone backdoor for scanning CSAM images. Previous links are here and here.
Apple says that hash collisions in its CSAM detection system were expected, and not a concern. I’m not convinced that this secondary system was originally part of the design, since it wasn’t discussed in the original specification.
Good op-ed from a group of Princeton researchers who developed a similar system:
Our system could be easily repurposed for surveillance and censorship. The design wasn’t restricted to a specific category of content; a service could simply swap in any content-matching database, and the person using that service would be none the wiser...</span>

                    <span>Switch-owning fans of demon murder (who somehow still haven&#x27;t played id Software&#x27;s legendary Doom saga) are in luck; as part of this year&#x27;s QuakeCon, id has announced a five-game Doom Slayers Collection for Nintendo&#x27;s console, which is available to purchase now.
The reveal isn&#x27;t too much of a surprise - US retailer Best Buy successfully managed to leak the Doom Slayers Collection for Switch earlier today ahead of its official reveal - but the game&#x27;s immediate post-announcement launch most certainly was, and Switch players can now enjoy some demon-hued FPS japes all in one bundle, featuring seminal 1993 original Doom, Doom 2, Doom 64, Doom 3, and 2016&#x27;s sort-of-rebooted Doom.
Notably, that&#x27;s one more game than was featured in the Doom Slayers Collection for Xbox and PlayStation, which released toward the end of last year minus Doom 64 - a pleasant treat for Switch owners, based on Digital Foundry&#x27;s previous enthusiasm for the port.

                    <span>Skyrim is ten years old this November and, to celebrate, Bethesda is launching yet another version of its much-loved fantasy RPG - appropriately titled the Anniversary Edition - on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. Oh, and fishing&#x27;s coming too.
Announced during QuakeCon&#x27;s Skyrim panel, the Anniversary Edition arrives on 11th November - exactly ten years after the launch of the original version - and bundles together 2016&#x27;s Skyrim Special Edition and a healthy chunk of additional content.
Specifically, it&#x27;ll feature over 500 Creation Club elements - Creation Club being Bethesda&#x27;s curated pool of officially sanctioned mods, which would usually need to be purchased with credits - including quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and spells.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re looking for a couple more video game freebies to shove unceremoniously into your almost certainly already overstuffed &#x27;to do&#x27; pile, Epic has you covered, with Yooka-Laylee and Void Bastards currently free on its PC store.
Yooka-Laylee, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is a spiritual successor to Rare&#x27;s beloved platformer Banjo-Kazooie - and was developed by Playtonic, a studio founded by a number of ex-Rare veterans. Lizard and bat replace bear and bird in Yooka-Laylee, but the formula will be immediately familiar to Banjo-Kazooie fans, setting players loose across a number of sprawling, predominantly platforming-focussed worlds as they embark on an perky, old-school collectathon in search of missing Quills.
All in all, it&#x27;s a decently entertaining adventure (although its superb side-scrolling sequel, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, is far superior), and one that Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a &quot;sumptuous, diverting homage to a bygone era in game design that should keep fans of the old school hooked, even if it doesn&#x27;t set the world on fire.&quot;

                    <span>id Software hasn&#x27;t done an entirely great job of keeping its secrets secret ahead of this year&#x27;s QuakeCon, but with this year&#x27;s digital-only event now underway, those earlier leaks are starting to be officially confirmed, beginning with the rumoured new edition of seminal 1996 FPS shooter Quake - which turns out to be an enhanced remaster from Night Dive Studios, and is out now on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.
Announced during Quakecon&#x27;s opening livestream session (which saw id&#x27;s Marty Stratton and Kevin Cloud, alongside Machine Games&#x27; Jerk Gustafsson, reflecting on Quake 25th anniversary), the newly enhanced version of Quake includes visual improvements, online and local split-screen multiplayer, plus a wealth of additional content.
Purchasers will receive the original Quake, its two official expansions - The Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity - plus two expansions created by Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games: Dimensions of the Past and the all-new Dimension of the Machine. Additionally, mods are supported on PC, while console player will be able to enjoy a selection of curated mods (as was the case for id&#x27;s updated versions of Doom on consoles) at a later date.

                    <span>Ghost of Tsushima has been given a proper PlayStation 5 upgrade, increasing resolution, decreasing loading times and removing pre-rendered cinematics for full real-time alternatives. It&#x27;s a decent - though not exactly game-changing - upgrade, but what did catch our eye beyond this is how the new PS5 version imports any existing PlayStation 4 game saves you may have on your system. It&#x27;s not a completely seamless experience, but the fact is that cross-save now works, allowing you to easily pick up on PS5 where you left off on PS4. 
The technical explanation for PlayStation 5&#x27;s cross-save issues is fairly straightforward. Up until recently, the PS5 system software has no visibility or access to any PlayStation 4 data on your console, meaning that highly convoluted means were required to move progress from one generation to the next. Essentially, the PS4 version of the game had to be patched to allow game saves to be uploaded to the cloud. Moving over to PS5, the cloud data would then be downloaded and progress could continue. Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered are two good examples of this workaround in action. However, more recent titles including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and now Ghost of Tsushima have allowed for native import of PS4 games.
We had a look at Sony&#x27;s SDK roadmap a while back and the concept of allowing PlayStation 5 titles to access PlayStation 4 user data was promised for a future update, which now appears to have rolled out. The first time I loaded Ghost of Tsushima, I disconnected my PS5 from the internet to rule out any potential cloud transfers, accessed the PS4 save game transfer option and discovered that all of my PS4 saves were available - the same saves I generated when I looked at the PS5 60fps patch for the game back in January. In turn, those saves were transferred across from my PS4 Pro using USB storage.

                    <span>One of the most enduring myths about Skyrim is it contains treasure foxes.
Ever since Bethesda&#x27;s open-world fantasy game came out in 2011, players have wondered whether the foxes lead players to treasure.
The myth of the treasure fox pops up online every now and then, with players debating whether it&#x27;s true or false.

As first reported by Motherboard on Sunday, someone on the dark web claims to have obtained the data of 100 million from T-Mobile’s servers and is selling a portion of it on an underground forum for 6 bitcoin, about $280,000. The trove includes not only names, phone numbers, and physical addresses but also more sensitive data like social security numbers, driver’s license information, and IMEI numbers, unique identifiers tied to each mobile device. Motherboard confirmed that samples of the data “contained accurate information on T-Mobile customers.”...</span>

                    <span>There&#x27;s not long left until the arrival of Life is Strange: True Colours, and ahead of its 10th September release, publisher Square Enix has shared 13 minutes of new gameplay footage, from what appears to be very early in the adventure.
True Colours sees the Life is Strange series heading off to another picturesque corner of the United States - this time to a small Colorado town, Haven Springs, in the shadow of the Rockies - for a brand-new adventure featuring a predominantly new cast of characters.
Here, the focus is on new protagonist Alex Chen who, unusually for the series, has lived with her powers - enabling her to hear the thoughts of other characters, as well as view and experience their emotions - for some time prior to the start of the adventure.

                    <span>Ignition Entertainment&#x27;s cult classic action-adventure El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron finally has a PC release date and will be making its way to Steam on 2nd September.
El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron - which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, having originally launched for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011 - is perhaps the first and only game to be inspired by the apocryphal Book of Enoch.
It recounts the story of Enoch (re-imagined as blond, denim-clad pretty boy) as he hunts downs seven fallen angels at the behest of God - a quest that blends 3D and side-on platform segments with some deceptively simple, and thrillingly balletic, three-weapon combat.

                    <span>Oddworld: Soulstorm, the most recent entry in developer Oddworld Inhabitants&#x27; long-running adventure saga, is currently in the works for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.
Soulstorm - the direct sequel to 2014&#x27;s Oddworld: New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty and a re-imagining of second series entry, 1998&#x27;s Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Exoddus - initially released for PlayStation and PC back in April to somewhat mixed reviews.
Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan, for instance, lamented the action-platformer&#x27;s &quot;unwelcome - and distinctly un-Oddworldly - scrappiness&quot;, which frequently manifested in a litany of unfortunate progress-thwarting bugs. &quot;A shame, really, because once I got through that,&quot; he continued, &quot;I was often swept along with the invention and vehemence and ugly beauty of what&#x27;s on offer in an Oddworld game. At their best these games really do things no other games do.&quot;

                    <span>Kazuma Kiryu from Yakuza is in Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania, Sega has announced.
The Yakuza protagonist is a playable character, free and unlockable through normal gameplay on all platforms at launch, Sega said. Trailer is below:
The news comes hot on the heels of confirmation Sonic and Tails are playable in Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania. Like, Kazuma Kiryu, Sonic and Tails are free and unlockable via normal gameplay. Selecting them also switches the game&#x27;s bananas to rings, with the Sonic series&#x27; classic sound effects included.

                    <span>EA has vowed to consider &quot;the player perspective&quot; when delisting games in the future.
In June, GOG announced it planned to delist classic quartet Ultima Underworld 1+2, Syndicate Plus and Syndicate Wars from its digital store at the &quot;publisher&#x27;s request&quot; (Electronic Arts).
Then, early August, all four games returned to GOG, where they were made free to download until 3rd September.

                    <span>Some of the people behind indie hit Among Us have spoken out about Fortnite&#x27;s new Impostors mode.
Yesterday, Fortnite developer Epic announced a new game mode for its all-encompassing battle royale that has an uncanny resemblance to 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game Among Us.
Fortnite Impostors sees 10 players, eight agents and two impostors play out their roles on a submarine. Like in Among Us, the agents carry out routine assignments, while the impostors sabotage the facility and eliminate players. Impostors can also teleport players to cover their tracks and disable assignments.

                    <span>Hot on the heels of the news Outriders may not have broken even despite sales of up to 3m units, comes confirmation Biomutant broke even a week after launch with sales of 1m.
Biomutant, developed by Swedish studio Experiment 101, launched 25th May, and has sold more than 1m copies, parent company Embracer Group said in a financial report issued this morning.
&quot;The full investment into development and marketing as well as the acquisition cost for Experiment 101 and the IP, was recouped within a week after launch,&quot; Embracer said.

                    <span>Apple’s NeuralHash algorithm — the one it’s using for client-side scanning on the iPhone — has been reverse-engineered.
Turns out it was already in iOS 14.3, and someone noticed:
Early tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations.

We also have the first collision: two images that hash to the same value.
The next step is to generate innocuous images that NeuralHash classifies as prohibited content.
This was a bad idea from the start, and Apple never seemed to consider the adversarial context of the system as a whole, and not just the cryptography...</span>

                    <span>Making games, we are often reminded, is hard, with development frequently being derailed by the most preposterously unpredictable things. Behold, for instance, the newly revealed story of Skyrim&#x27;s iconic cart ride, and how it was, for a time before release, routinely thwarted by a particularly stubborn bee.
The full tale was recently recounted on Twitter by 14-year Bethesda veteran - and now solo indie developer - Nate Purkeypile, who served as senior world and lighting artist during the creation of Skyrim. &quot;That intro is famous now,&quot; Purkeypile wrote, &quot;but back then, it was just that one thing that we had to keep working and working on forever.&quot;
According to Purkeypile, the cart ride was particularly prone to mishaps during development because its bumps and bounces toward Helgen were physically simulated (&quot;Why you ask?,&quot; he adds, &quot;Good question.&quot;) - meaning environmental objects carelessly strewn about the place had a tendency to make the vehicle behave unpredictably, sometimes causing it to fly off the road. As the developer puts it, &quot;The cart had a path it wanted to follow, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it was a path it COULD follow.&quot;

                    <span>Developer Cyan Worlds&#x27; previously Oculus Quest-exclusive remake of seminal CD-ROM puzzle adventure Myst is coming to PC, Mac, and Xbox on 26th August.
This &quot;definitive, modern edition&quot; of Myst (not to be confused with the game&#x27;s first fully 3D remake, realMyst, released back in the year 2000) debuted on the Oculus Store last December, significantly sprucing up the iconic islands first introduced to players back in 1993.
New art and sound are the most obvious improvements to the original game - alongside a photo mode to easily record clues and a randomised puzzle option for those seeking a greater challenge - but this latest version of Myst is also &quot;built from the ground up&quot; for VR.

                    <span>CD Projekt is readying to release Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s &quot;biggest patch to date&quot; - the third major update since the RPG&#x27;s disastrous launch last December - and has now shared full details of what it will bring, including an improved minimap and the game&#x27;s first selection of free DLC.
Prior to Cyberpunk&#x27;s launch, CD Projekt whipped up player interest with the promise of free post-launch DLC. However, plans for additional content were put on hold while the developer worked to fix the game&#x27;s litany of bugs and to bring Cyberpunk&#x27;s widely lambasted last-gen console release up to a more acceptable standard. Now though, according to senior quest designer Patrick Mills on tonight&#x27;s 1.3 update dev stream, &quot;streaming and memory management&quot; have reached a point &quot;where we can start trying to deliver those things&quot;.
As such, 1.3 includes the first of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s free DLC, mostly falling into the category of &#x27;minor cosmetic additions&#x27;. There are two new jackets - a red and shiny number, plus a grey and yellow option with a fur collar - alongside the Quartz Bandit: an orange and black car with its innards on the outside. The jackets and car are two separate rewards unlocked by completing small objectives received on reaching certain points in the game (anyone beyond those point will get the DLC on loading a save), and CD Projekt says future DLC drops will follow the same pattern of integration, with the goal being to make the world feel a little richer.

                    <span>Epic has added a new game mode into Fortnite that has an uncanny resemblance to Among Us. 
Fortnite Imposters sees 10 players, eight agents and two imposters play out their roles on a submarine. Like in Among Us, the agents carry out routine assignments, while the imposters sabotage the facility and eliminate players. Imposters can also teleport players to cover their tracks and disable assignments. 
Of course, it wouldn&#x27;t be Fortnite without a few memes. For a short period‌, a &quot;Peely Party&quot; takes place where all agents and imposters look like Peely, an iconic character of judicial significance.

                    <span>Rocket League on PlayStation 5 gets a 120hz mode tomorrow, 18th August, developer Psyonix announced in a post on the PlayStation Blog.
A new &quot;Video Quality&quot; setting within the Video Settings menu lets players select Quality or Performance modes.
Quality mode enables 4K resolution at 60fps with HDR. HDR requires an HDR10-compatible display and HDMI 2.0 cable or better, and you&#x27;ll need a 4K capable display to experience 4K. If you use a 1080p display in this mode, Rocket League renders at 1080p supersampled from 4K.

                    <span>A writer on Rainbow Six Siege has expressed their pride at the game&#x27;s first transgender operator, who arrives with the Crystal Guard season update.
Narrative writer, Simon Ducharme, said they are &quot;incredibly proud&quot; of developing the character and had &quot;tears of joy&quot; knowing they were &quot;encouraged and supported&quot; to write queer characters.
Speaking to Gamespot, Ducharme added: &quot;The decision to create a transgender character was made early on, as part of our initiative to have an inclusive roster of Operators. The consultants, all of whom are trans people, wanted to make sure that Osa was presented as authentically and organically as possible. She was written by a queer person and she is voiced by a trans woman - and while her identity is certainly influenced by her gender, who she is in the Siege universe is centered on her talents, her influence on Nighthaven, and her close friendship to Kali.&quot;

                    <span>The developer of Outriders has said Square Enix has yet to pay it a royalty fee, suggesting it has yet to break even.
In a financial statement, Polish company People Can Fly said that up to 16th August, it had not received royalties on the sale of the co-op-focused looter-shooter from publisher Square Enix.
Royalties would be paid to PCF if the net receipts from the sales of Outriders yielded the pre-agreed level of returns for Square Enix on the costs incurred relating to quality assurance, distribution and marketing. Essentially, the contract states PCF gets its royalties on profits only after Square Enix makes back its investment.

                    <span>Riot misled staff about their right to speak out about harassment and discrimination, according to the State of California.
Riot has denied the claims.
The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing - the same agency suing Activision Blizzard over what it alleges to be a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - said League of Legends maker Riot failed to tell its staff of their right to speak to the government about harassment and discrimination. The DFEH filed its own lawsuit against Riot in February.

                    <span>Naughty Dog once worked on a Last of Us Part 2 multiplayer mode, a datamine suggests.
YouTuber Specilizer found multiplayer assets in the game that point to a large multiplayer map, which they speculate could be for a Factions battle royale mode given the size of the map. Considering the development period and release date of the game saw the explosive rise of battle royale games like Fortnite and PUBG, it makes sense Sony would have wanted to explore the genre with a first-party title.
Other assets include a &quot;Listen-Mode-Device&quot;, which could potentially be the way to use listen mode in multiplayer. There are also backpack and armour models specifically for multiplayer.

                    <span>A watchdog has launched an investigation into Ubisoft Singapore over alleged unfairness and sexual harassment.
According to an investigation by Kotaku, staff at Ubisoft Singapore, which is home to around 500 staff and is current working on the troubled Skull &amp; Bones, allegedly suffered from sexual harassment, racial pay disparities and bullying by managers, as well as &quot;bad projects&quot; and &quot;toxic leaders&quot;.
Now, in a report by The Straits Times, an English-language daily broadsheet newspaper based in Singapore, the national watchdog for fair employment practices has launched an investigation into Ubisoft Singapore over the claims.

                    <span>Authors: Brandon Smith (Microsoft)
Kubernetes v1.22 introduced a new alpha feature for clusters that
include Windows nodes: HostProcess containers.
HostProcess containers aim to extend the Windows container model to enable a wider
range of Kubernetes cluster management scenarios. HostProcess containers run
directly on the host and maintain behavior and access similar to that of a regular
process. With HostProcess containers, users can package and distribute management
operations and functionalities that require host access while retaining versioning
and deployment methods provided by containers. This allows Windows containers to
be used for a variety of device plugin, storage, and networking management scenarios
in Kubernetes. With this comes the enablement of host network mode—allowing

                    <span>Two years after its arrival in Dead by Daylight, Stranger Things is returning to the Upside Down, with all DLC inspired by Netflix&#x27;s hit show being removed from sale this November. But as Dead by Daylight starts its long goodbye to one franchise, it&#x27;s preparing to say hello to another, with all signs pointing to the imminent arrival of Hellraiser in-game.
First introduced in September 2019, Dead by Daylight&#x27;s Stranger Things collaboration ushered in two new survivors - Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler - alongside new killer The Demogorgon, and the Underground Complex Map.
For reasons unspecified (although almost certainly licensing-related), The Demogorgon, Nancy, and Steve - plus each characters&#x27; respective outfit cosmetics - will no longer be available for purchase in Dead by Daylight&#x27;s store from 17th November.

                    <span>BloodRayne Betrayal is getting remastered and will be heading to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC - complete with full voice acting and other additions - on 9th September.
Developed by Shantae studio WayForward and released in 2011, Betrayal marked a notable shift for the BloodRayne series, ditching the third-person action of previous instalments in order to send half-vampire protagonist Rayne on a side-scrolling hack-and-slash adventure through 15 monster-battering stages of spooky old castle.
For Betrayal&#x27;s imminent remaster - officially known as BloodRayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites - WayForward and publisher Ziggurat Interactive are promising a range of improvements, including the addition of full voice acting to enliven the text-only original.

                    <span>John Romero still isn&#x27;t done with Doom; the legendary designer has confirmed he&#x27;s currently working on a follow-up to his &quot;unofficial&quot; Doom episode, Sigil.
Announced to coincide with Doom&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2018 and released as a free megawad the following year, Sigil was designed as the unofficial fifth episode in the original Doom saga - picking up after Ultimate Doom&#x27;s Thy Flesh Consumed - and treated fans to 18 brand-new, Romero-designed levels: nine single-player and nine death match.
Two years on from its release, Sigil was looking increasingly like a one-off experiment for Romero, but now - in a new video interview with Bridgeburner, lead developer on Doom total conversion The Age of Hell (skip to the 42-minute mark) - the designer has confirmed he&#x27;s currently working on a sequel, this time utilising Doom 2.

                    <span>The Metal Gear Solid speedrunning community is currently in a frenzy after a streamer accidentally discovered a huge skip.
As spotted by TheGamer, streamer boba accidentally discovered a skip in the original, 23-year-old Metal Gear Solid game over the weekend that saves over two minutes of play.
The clip below shows the moment boba discovered the skip:

                    <span>Baiken from Guilty Gear is confirmed as the next DLC character for Samurai Shodown.
Baiken goes on sale on 18th August, according to the video below, as part of Samurai Shodown&#x27;s third season of DLC characters.
Baiken is a neat fit for weapon-based fighting game Samurai Shodown. In the world of Guilty Gear, Baiken is a wandering samurai out for revenge on That Man. She isn&#x27;t a playable character in the recently-released Guilty Gear Strive, although she appears briefly in the story mode.

                    <span>Bloodborne has a first-person mod that goes beyond simply moving the camera.
Modder Garden of Eyes worked with modder Zullie the Witch, who created the Dark Souls 3 first-person mod, to create Bloodborne&#x27;s first-person mod. Trailer is below:
As you&#x27;d expect, Bloodborne&#x27;s combat looks and feels entirely different in first-person, where you don&#x27;t have as comprehensive a view of the action afforded by a third-person perspective. The bosses in particular look extra scary up close!

                    <span>Capcom has released a Street Fighter 5 update and, surprising fans, has tweaked Sakura&#x27;s face.
Sakura&#x27;s face as it appears on the Street Fighter 5 character select screen has been a point of contention ever since she was added to the fighting game in January 2018, with some criticising her &quot;bug eyes&quot; and &quot;alien&quot; look.
The update changes Sakura&#x27;s character select stance, and so we see her face from a slightly different angle and with different lighting. This makes all the difference, and her face on character select now doesn&#x27;t have that bug-like alien look.

Jack-O&#x27;, the second DLC character for the fighting game, launches on 27th August for season pass owners and goes on individual sale 30th August.
The trailer below gives us an idea of Jack-O&#x27;&#x27;s energetic fighting style - she uses her trademark mask and chain as well as minions as traps, projectiles and combo extenders.

                    <span>Marvel&#x27;s Avengers players already know that Black Panther is set to arrive later this week, but developer Crystal Dynamic has also now revealed other characters coming to the MMO, too, including Ulysses Klaue and &quot;iconic&quot; villain, Crossbones.
&quot;I think what&#x27;s really fun about the sheer amount of Marvel villains on our roster is we get to really dig into what would be the most interesting twist and turn from what we&#x27;ve done previously,&quot; writer Hannah MacLeod told GameInformer (thanks, TheGamer).
&quot;Crossbones has some of the most iconic comic dialogue ever because he just enjoys himself so much, but he&#x27;s also got some interesting tricks up his sleeve. There&#x27;s always a lot of discussion of who we think our villains should be. Klaue doesn&#x27;t really get his hands dirty in the same way as other villains might, so we needed him to have a character who would have no problem with that.&quot;

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve noticed that you haven&#x27;t been able to pull off any assassinations in the Halo Infinite tech test, there&#x27;s a reason for that - they&#x27;ve been removed. 
Halo Infinite developer, 343 Industries, confirmed assassinations will not be available in the sci-fi shooter during a livestream back at the end of July. However, the recent test flight has seen interest in the notably absent franchise tradition resurface online.
Assassinations - animations that are triggered when you creep up on an enemy player and melee them from behind - have long been a Halo staple. But despite the team at 343i &quot;really lov[ing] assassinations&quot;, they&#x27;ve been removed because of the &quot;gameplay disadvantage&quot; to pulling one off.

                    <span>Valve has awarded a security researcher $7500 for reporting a bug that permitted players to falsify credits to their Steam wallet.
As spotted by The Daily Swig, researcher &quot;drbrix&quot; reported the exploit via HackerOne, stating they had &quot;found [a] vulnerability which allows attacker to generate steam wallet balance&quot;. The bug - which has since been resolved - would permit players with &quot;amount100&quot; in their Steam account email address to intercept payments made via Smart2Pay and artificially inflate them (thanks, NME).
After detailing how the exploit could be generated, Valve&#x27;s JonP promptly thanked drbrix and agreed the team at Valve had been able to &quot;validate this is happening pretty much as described&quot;, and were taking steps to address it.

                    <span>Spider-Man is still coming to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers and should be with us by the end of the year.
As Matt told us at the time, Spider-Man was revealed to be coming to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers - controversially as a PlayStation-only addition - last August, with Crystal Dynamics announcing an &quot;early 2021&quot; release date for the character. 
However, questions began to arise earlier this year when the studio revealed a new Marvel&#x27;s Avengers development roadmap in which Spidey was notably absent, and ended in Crystal Dynamics formally confirming a delay.

While the highly-anticipated sequel has yet to be formally confirmed by developer Remedy, it&#x27;s long been rumoured that the two-project publishing deal Remedy struck with Epic Games will both be set within the same franchise, and many speculate they&#x27;re connected to horror Alan Wake. 
Now, courtesy of the company&#x27;s latest investor report, the studio has provided an update on both projects.

                    <span>Boyfriend Dungeon developer Kitfox has agreed to update its content warning following feedback from players.
Though the current statement warns that users should &quot;play with care&quot; given the game &quot;may include references to unwanted advances, stalking, and other forms of emotional manipulation&quot;, the mature themes have prompted Kitfox to update the warning and make it &quot;more accurate&quot; in an update next week.
&quot;The content warning for Boyfriend Dungeon inadequately describes the events of stalking and emotional manipulation that exist in the story,&quot; the developer said in a statement on Twitter (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;We&#x27;ll update the game next week with a more accurate CW. We apologise for any hurt inflicted by our mistake. Thank you for playing!&quot;

                    <span>PowerSlave Exhumed is an upcoming port of the cult classic mid-&#x27;90s first-person shooter.
It&#x27;s from Nightdive Studios, the developer behind the recent releases of Doom 64 and Shadow Man and the upcoming System Shock remake. The trailer is below:
PowerSlave first released in 1996 on the Sega Saturn, and for the time had a unique mix of traps, puzzle-solving and first-person platforming. It acted as a precursor to the likes of Nintendo&#x27;s Metroid Prime.

As reported by TorrentFreak, a California district judge ordered Matthew Storman, owner of currently offline RomUniverse, to &quot;permanently destroy all unauthorised Nintendo games or other unauthorised copies of Nintendo&#x27;s intellectual property including movies, books, and music&quot; no later than 17th August.
Storman must file a declaration, under penalty of perjury, with the California federal court &quot;certifying his compliance with these terms&quot; by 20th August.

                    <span>Return to Empire is a China-only mobile game based on Microsoft&#x27;s Age of Empires.
It&#x27;s developed by TiMi Studio, the Tencent-owned company behind Call of Duty: Mobile and Pokémon Unite.
Today, TiMi released the first gameplay of Return to Empire. It looks like Age of Empires, albeit on a reduced scale, with real-time strategy action.

In mid-July, Valve game YouTubers joined up to issue players the &quot;Breaking the Bar&quot; challenge: beat Half-Life 2&#x27;s concurrents record by playing the game at 4pm today, 14th August.
The community wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what Half-Life 2&#x27;s concurrent peak was prior to today. According to Steam Charts, whose data goes back to July 2012, it was 6882, set back in March 2020 and sparked by the release of Half-Life: Alyx.

The news helps explain Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s recent GTA mod takedown spree - particular mods that recreated the games in question.
But it also helps explain why Rockstar nuked a San Andreas fan remake trailer in July 2020, too.

                    <span>EA has issued a start warning to those playing the Battlefield 2042 technical playtest this weekend: break NDA and face a potential ban from the final game.
Battlefield 2042&#x27;s closed playtest kicked off on Thursday with PC, and has now brought Xbox into the fold (the planned PlayStation test was cancelled at the last minute due to a &quot;critical issue&quot;). Predictably, gameplay footage leaked online, which EA yesterday scrambled to pull offline.
An NDA (non-disclosure agreement) is typically required from video game publishers for tests such as this, and aims to prevent the sharing of information, impressions or assets from the playable build.

                    <span>Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls, the canned mobile-exclusive instalment of Konami&#x27;s legendary platform series, is being resurrected for Apple Arcade.
Grimoire of Souls was initially announced back in 2018, promising a portable slice of gothic action-platforming focussed on the adventures of Genya Arikado - a &quot;persona of Alucard - as he attempted to stop the impending resurrection of Dracula.
That quest took him to worlds inside magical grimoires for familiar bouts of side-scrolling action, playable both solo and co-operatively, and across a variety of different modes - with the game featuring a number of other playable characters, including Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Charlotte Aulin, and, Glyph Master Shanoa.

                    <span>As the Battlefield 2042 technical preview goes ahead, EA is scrambling to take down leaked gameplay footage all over the internet.
Last week, Battlefield fans were invited to sign up to test a technical preview of the game, which they were not allowed to discuss even receiving.  
Of course, despite EA&#x27;s perhaps unrealistic wishes, word of the preview inevitably leaked, foreshadowing what was to come.

                    <span>The problem with spear phishing it that it takes time and creativity to create individualized enticing phishing emails. Researchers are using GPT-3 to attempt to solve that problem:
The researchers used OpenAI’s GPT-3 platform in conjunction with other AI-as-a-service products focused on personality analysis to generate phishing emails tailored to their colleagues’ backgrounds and traits. Machine learning focused on personality analysis aims to be predict a person’s proclivities and mentality based on behavioral inputs. By running the outputs through multiple services, the researchers were able to develop a pipeline that groomed and refined the emails before sending them out. They say that the results sounded “weirdly human” and that the platforms automatically supplied surprising specifics, like mentioning a Singaporean law when instructed to generate content for people living in Singapore...</span>

                    <span>Rockstar is reportedly putting the finishing touches to remasters of its open-world PlayStation 2-era classics Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas for release later this year.
Rumours of possible remasters for the games first bubbled up over the summer as fans began wondering why Take-Two&#x27;s lawyers had suddenly started issuing a raft of takedown notices for classic GTA mods. Speculation grew further following Take-Two&#x27;s recent confirmation it had three unannounced &quot;new iterations of previously released titles&quot; in the works.
Now, however, an investigation by Kotaku has revealed more tangible details, with its sources - who, the website says, have a proven track record providing accurate information on GTA Online and Red Dead Online - claiming Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are indeed getting the remaster treatment.

                    <span>Cory Davis, creative director and designer on Spec Ops: The Line, and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck have joined forces to establish a new game studio, Eyes Out.
Based in Los Angeles, Eyes Out is said to consist of a team of &quot;passionate world-builders and storytellers who believe in the powerful synesthesia that emerges from music, narrative, and interactive experiences&quot;. Work on the studio&#x27;s first project is currently underway, and while specifics are limited, it&#x27;s described as a &quot;single-player immersive cosmic horror game with strong environmental storytelling elements.&quot;
The project won&#x27;t be Davis&#x27; first tangle with the horror genre; while cult favourite 2012 shooter Spec Ops: The Line is perhaps his most discussed work, Davis&#x27; packed resume also features level design credits on the horror-heavy Condemned 2: Bloodshot and F.E.A.R: Extraction Point, and he served as director on 2016&#x27;s surreal PSVR horror title Here They Lie.

                    <span>Lone Echo 2, the sequel to developer Ready at Dawn&#x27;s acclaimed 2017 zero-gravity VR adventure, will miss its previously announced 24th August release date, and is now expected to launch on Oculus devices some time &quot;later this year&quot;.
Lone Echo 2 catapults protagonists Captain Olivia Rhodes and player-controlled android Echo One (nicknamed &quot;Jack&quot;) 400 years into the future, where an abandoned space station holds the key to returning home. Pre-release glimpses suggest it&#x27;ll deliver another bout of moody sci-fi adventure built around zero-gravity traversal and puzzling, with Ready at Dawn promising &quot;complex challenges&quot; and &quot;startling discoveries&quot; as its &quot;emotional&quot; far-future story unfolds.
Lone Echo 2 was originally announced all the way back in 2018 for a release the following year, but the game has see multiple delays along the way - the most recent due to development challenges involving the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. And now Ready at Dawn has confirmed it&#x27;ll be pushing launch back once more in a post to its blog.

                    <span>It looks like there&#x27;s more death, misery and ice on the horizon - as a sequel to Frostpunk has been announced by 11 Bit Studios. 
Frostpunk 2 is the first of three current in-house projects to be formally revealed by 11-Bit Studios, and given the success of the first game, perhaps this one doesn&#x27;t come as much of a surprise. A brief announcement trailer has been released, showing that the world of Frostpunk has moved on from coal to oil - although it looks just as brutal as before.  
&quot;In Frostpunk&#x27;s successor, players are once again tasked with playing as the leader of a resource-hungry metropolis where the expansion and search for new sources of power is an unavoidable reality. But the apocalyptic world has moved on,&quot; says the press release. &quot;After the age of coal, conquering Frostland for the oil extraction industry is expected to be the new salvation of what&#x27;s left of humanity. However, change does not come easily, and not everyone in this new multi-layered society will welcome this new direction.&quot;

&quot;Exodus&quot; introduces the No-Pats, a multinational armed militia that is engaged in a civil war over the future of the group. The film also confirms that the other main factions of the game will be the United States and Russia. 
Both states are on the brink of war as the world struggles over resources and surrounding nations have collapsed, while the group of nomads from collapsed nations known as the Non-Patriated (&quot;No-Pats&quot;) appear to have bound together for survival.

                    <span>Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan was forced to suspend several rides yesterday after a stack of Goomba characters plummeted to the ground. 
No injuries have been reported.
The Goomba statue broke free from its normal position atop the Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure ride, Asahi Shumbun Digital reported (thanks, VGC). The Goombas fell just next to the ride&#x27;s track, close to where a Yoshi car was passing by, but not directly onto anywhere guests could have been.

The somewhat inevitable crossover includes a series of in-game quests for a free emote voiced by Reynolds himself (or in your local language in non-English speaking countries), as well as a frankly horrifying skin.
This skin is Reynolds&#x27; other character in the film, the muscled &quot;Dude&quot;. It&#x27;ll be available in Fortnite&#x27;s item shop tonight upon its usual reset time. Here it is, along with that emote:

                    <span>Doctor Who&#x27;s brand-new mobile (and PC) game is out now on consoles. 
Doctor Who: The Lonely Assassins builds on the events of iconic Doctor Who episode Blink, transporting players into a series of sinister events occurring at Wester Drumlins - the very same abandoned London townhouse where the Weeping Angels made their first TV appearance.
It stars ex-UNIT scientist Petronella Osgood (played by Ingrid Oliver), who is investigating the events of the legendary Blink episode, and the subsequent disappearance of Larry (Finlay Robertson returns to play as Larry).

The game is set to launch on Xbox and PlayStation&#x27;s last-gen and current-gen consoles, and now its developer has said its &quot;vision&quot; is to bring Splitgate to Switch. 
In a developer Q&amp;A earlier this week (thanks, GameSpot), developer 1047 Games said it plans to expand its platform support.

                    <span>Back in January, we got a pretty extensive look at the remastered environments and quests being made for Skyblivion - a mod project seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine. The team behind this ambitious project has continued making progress, and the latest mod development video focuses on some of the stunning landscapes that are now nearing completion. 
According to the new video, the majority of Skyblivion&#x27;s map is now in the final stages of development, and the work shown so far is seriously impressive. The video discusses how areas such as the forest surrounding the Orange Road have been adapted and improved for the remake. The team decided to make the forest &quot;more lush and detailed than its original counterpart&quot; and make it larger to give it a more prominent role in the game, citing the area&#x27;s ambience and popularity with players as the reason for giving it more attention. 
Blackwood, meanwhile, has been given more fortifications and border gates to add points of interest. The new boggy marsh at the centre of Blackwood, called Blackmarch, looks suitably horrifying and spooky - promising players a subregion full of ruins and decay. The city of Leyawiin has been redesigned from the ground up &quot;referencing concept art from Oblivion that was likely discarded owing to technical and time limitations&quot;, with the city divided into three distinct sections. Boats are now able to sail right through the city, allowing them to go further inland.

                    <span>As Eurogamer reported back in March, Vanguard is the name of this year&#x27;s Call of Duty, which will see a return for the series to World War 2.
Last night, artwork and details of Vanguard appeared online, apparently found hiding within Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War files (thanks, Charlie Intel).

                    <span>Three high-profile Blizzard employees are no longer part of the company, Activision Blizzard has today confirmed. 
Luis Barriga and Jesse McCree, Diablo 4&#x27;s game director and lead designer, as well as World of Warcraft designer Jonathan LeCraft, are all reported by Kotaku to have been let go.
Activision Blizzard has not given specific reasons for the departures, but noted in a statement it had assigned &quot;new leaders&quot; where appropriate and would &quot;move forward to ensure a safe, productive work environment for all&quot;.

                    <span>Apex Legends lead game designer Daniel Klein has been fired from developer Respawn after offensive blog posts written by him were recently surfaced.
Klein has apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; for the sexist and racist language in the posts, which he says were written in 2007.
&quot;I was recently confronted with some awful statements made on a blog I wrote back in 2007,&quot; Klein wrote on Twitter a couple of weeks ago. &quot;I take full ownership for the things I said, and I&#x27;m embarrassed, sad, and angry at my younger self for saying this stuff. I hope it is obvious that I don&#x27;t believe these things anymore.&quot;

The blog post explains some of the internals of the Memory manager, a beta feature
of Kubernetes 1.22. In Kubernetes, the Memory Manager is a
kubelet subcomponent.
The memory manage provides guaranteed memory (and hugepages)
allocation for pods in the Guaranteed QoS class.
This blog post covers:
Why do you need it?
The internal details of how the MemoryManager works
Current limitations of the MemoryManager
Future work for the MemoryManager
Why do you need it?
Some Kubernetes workloads run on nodes with
non-uniform memory access (NUMA).
Suppose you have NUMA nodes in your cluster. In that case, you&#x27;ll know about the potential for extra latency when
compute resources need to access memory on the different NUMA locality.

                    <span>Boyfriend Dungeon, the long-awaited weapon-romancing dungeon-crawler from developer Kitfox Games, is finally here on PC, Xbox, Switch, and Game Pass.
If Boyfriend Dungeon seems like a name that&#x27;s been knocking around for a while, you&#x27;d be right; it was initially announced back in 2017, and successfully raised $272,000 in Kickstarter crowdfunding a year later. Since then, Kitfox has been hard at work on its genre-mash-up oddity - lovingly referred to as a &quot;shack-and-slash&quot; - that&#x27;s part dungeon-crawler  (complete with procedurally generated maps and varied combat styles) and part dating sim.
&quot;You move into your cousin&#x27;s old apartment, rent-free for the summer,&quot; Kitfox explains in a bout of scene-setting. &quot;To get some confidence and meet people, plus earn a little cash, you&#x27;re tasked with clearing the creatures in &#x27;the dunj&#x27;. Soon you discover weapons [that] transform into cuties... and they&#x27;re SINGLE!... But someone&#x27;s abducting weapons and leaving them damaged in the dungeon! Who could do such a thing? Will you solve the blade-napping mystery? Will you find love? Or, friendship, at least?&quot;.

                    <span>American Truck Simulator players eager to hit the road in search of new horizons can now get a 20-minute taste of the superb sim&#x27;s upcoming Wyoming expansion in a new gameplay video.
Wyoming will be the eighth world-expanding DLC to release for American Truck Simulator since its launch back in 2016 (following on from Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, and last year&#x27;s Colorado), bringing its state count up to a total of ten once the base game&#x27;s California and Nebraska are factored in - meaning SCS Software will officially be one fifth of the way through its recreation the US on Wyoming&#x27;s arrival.
&quot;Wyoming may be one of the least populated states in the US,&quot; SCS explained previously, &quot;but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it lacks spectacular places to visit and see. Home to some of the country&#x27;s most breathtaking national parks, Wyoming is best known for its red-walled gorges, hot springs, historic prairie towns, pioneer history, and historical attractions.&quot;

                    <span>It was a busy old Indie World showcase this evening, with Nintendo serving up another brisk - but extremely eventful - look at some of the new titles heading to Switch between right now and into next year. Headliners included surprise launches for Axiom Verge 2 and Boyfriend Dungeon, not to mention an upcoming release for the superb Tetris Effect: Connected, but if you missed the show and want a convenient catch-up, you&#x27;ll find everything announced below.
Necrobarista: Final Pour, an enhanced version of the acclaimed visual-novel-style adventure from Route 59, is launching as a timed console exclusive on Switch today. Once again, the stylishly told story focusses on a magical Melbourne cafe where the dead are granted one last night to mingle with the living, but Final Pour introduces new narrative content, remastered visuals, plus a new Studios mode, where players can create their own dialogue and stories.
Necrobarista isn&#x27;t the only game launching on Switch, however; head to the eShop right now and you&#x27;ll find Axiom Verge 2, the long-awaited follow-up to developer Thomas Happ&#x27;s acclaimed 2015 retro-styled Metroid-a-like, as well as vibrant life-sim-style adventure Garden Story - a timed console exclusive on Switch that charts a sentient grape&#x27;s attempts to fend of the omnipresent Rot and help rejuvenate an island and its inhabitants.

This remaster is set to add facial motion capture, engine and lighting upgrades to Dontnod&#x27;s original Life is Strange as well as Deck Nine&#x27;s acclaimed prequel Before the Storm. 
The series&#x27; all-new entry Life is Strange True Colors is still on track to arrive on 10th September, publisher Square Enix reassured fans this evening, while its Wavelengths story DLC starring fan-favourite character Steph will now take the Remastered Collection&#x27;s old release spot of 30th September.

The original Tetris Effect, created by legendary game designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi (known for the likes of Rez, Lumines, and Space Channel 5), was, of course, very good indeed, transforming the classic puzzler into a mesmerising audio-visual treat. We even called it our Game of the Year when it released in 2018 (and one of our Games of the Decade in 2019.
Last year&#x27;s Tetris Effect: Connected update expanded on the superb single-player original with a range of new online and local multiplayer modes (both co-op and competitive), and it&#x27;s this version - also featuring cross-platform online support - that&#x27;ll be released on Switch in October.

Nintendo revealed the date this afternoon, as part of its just-finished Switch indie game showcase. 
We&#x27;ve had our eyes on Eastward for some time, through various demos (here, Chris Tapsell writes about being enraptured by it, all the way back at EGX 2019).

To say we&#x27;ve been waiting a while for this sequel would be an understatement. Axiom Verge 2 was already four years in the making when it was announced in 2019, back then for launch in 2020.

                    <span>Niantic, developer of Pokémon Go, has laid out its long-term plan for a &quot;real-world&quot; metaverse based on our global reality - rather than an entirely virtual one of the kind seen in Ready Player One.
In an extended blog post titled &quot;The Metaverse is a Dystopian Nightmare, Let&#x27;s Build a Better Reality&quot;, company founder John Hanke has discussed his vision for how technology can be harnessed to build a better version of our world which strengthens in-person interactions - while criticising the idea of technology designed to abandon our reality and instead play inside a computer simulation.
This is all long-term future stuff, so there&#x27;s no direct reference to Pokémon Go&#x27;s ongoing big debate around pandemic interaction distance changes. (It also arrives alongside news of another Niantic company acquisition - this time of fancy 3D scanning app Scaniverse.) But there are certainly comments here which reinforce Niantic&#x27;s long-term ethos for its games - and Pokémon Go in particular - which touch on issues raised in that debate, and perhaps further illuminate Niantic&#x27;s own position in it.

                    <span>Teabagging is a 20-year-old Halo tradition, the ultimate insult on the virtual battlefield - but don&#x27;t expect Halo Infinite&#x27;s otherwise lifelike bots to get stuck in.
Anyone who&#x27;s played a Halo game online will probably have been teabagged. For the uninitiated, it involves repeatedly pressing the crouch button so your Spartan character squats up and down on your enemy&#x27;s corpse.
Halo players have been teabagging each other since Halo: Combat Evolved came out in 2001, to rub it in, to frustrate and annoy. In the online world of Halo, teabagging is very much human behaviour.

The mode tasks players to protect various locations from up to 10 waves of incoming enemies. Players will have to position themselves around the map to defend all the areas. 
The locations are Blackwater, Fort Mercer, Valentine, Strawberry, and MacFarlane&#x27;s Ranch.

Typhoon closed its doors earlier this year when Google shut down its internal Stadia studios just 14 months after the streaming tech&#x27;s high-profile launch.
Raccoon Logic is the new Montreal-based studio that is, essentially, the Google-acquired Typhoon Studios reborn. It has secured a &quot;large&quot; initial investment from Chinese megacorp Tencent, and regained the intellectual property rights for Journey to the Savage Planet.

You can acquire the free costume by logging into your Ubisoft Connect account on console or PC - but there&#x27;s a twist. For now, Ezio&#x27;s clothes are only available if Ubisoft detects you have played two previous games in the series.

As reported by Axios, SOC Investment Group&#x27;s executive director Dieter Waizeneggar issued a letter to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s lead independant director Robert J. Morgado, criticising the steps the company has said it is taking to address the ongoing culture crisis.
Last week, Activision Blizzard executives such as boss Bobby Kotick insisted &quot;we will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry&quot;.

                    <span>The recently-released The Ascent is a gorgeous, incredibly-detailed cyberpunk action role-playing game that plays from a fixed, top-down, isometric perspective. But what happens when you unlock the camera?
In the video below spotted by Kotaku, Gaming with Griff Griffin shows us that Neon Giant&#x27;s The Ascent looks just as good in first-person, with an impressive level of detail on display when you&#x27;re viewing the world up close. We see detailed character models, environments and even objects in shops (The Ascent&#x27;s shops are great!). I love the Neuromancer nod, too.
Griff Griffin used a tool called the Universal Unreal Engine 4 Unlocker to move the camera about (details are in the video description). It&#x27;s a great thing, too because we see The Ascent&#x27;s compelling cyberpunk world holds up under close scrutiny. That developer Neon Giant is a studio of just 12 people makes this all the more impressive.

Dynamaxing was introduced to the Pokémon series in Sword and Shield. This game mechanic allows a Pokémon to grow in size, turning their attacks into powerful Max Moves.

                    <span>As far as conferences go, AWS re:Invent is certainly notable. It’s the absolute center of the Cloud World for a week each year in Las Vegas. But given the physical and virtual split for this year’s conference, I started mulling over: What is re:Invent at its heart? AWS calls re:Invent an “educational conference.” Given how […]

                    <span>Cobolt Strike is a security tool, used by penetration testers to simulate network attackers. But it’s also used by attackers — from criminals to governments — to automate their own attacks. Researchers have found a vulnerability in the product.
The main components of the security tool are the Cobalt Strike client — also known as a Beacon — and the Cobalt Strike team server, which sends commands to infected computers and receives the data they exfiltrate. An attacker starts by spinning up a machine running Team Server that has been configured to use specific “malleability” customizations, such as how often the client is to report to the server or specific data to periodically send...</span>

                    <span>Set photos snapped by fans earlier this year seemed to confirm it, but now it&#x27;s official: Knuckles will be joining Sonic the Hedgehog in Paramount Pictures&#x27; upcoming live-action movie sequel, and he&#x27;ll be played by none other than Idris Elba.
Knuckles&#x27; inclusion in the second Sonic movie seemed almost certain after fans spotted a stand-in prop of the echidna (alongside similar ones for Sonic and Tails) on-set back in April, and we&#x27;ve now been given a first official tease of the character&#x27;s movie look on Twitter.
The image - a close-up of Knuckles&#x27; knuckles, naturally - was shared by Idris Elba on social media following confirmation that the actor (most recently seen in James Gunn&#x27;s The Suicide Squad) would be voicing the character in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, which is scheduled to arrive in cinemas on 8th April 2022 if all goes well.

                    <span>As part of its decidedly leisurely ID@Xbox indie showcase this evening, Microsoft confirmed another batch of titles heading to Game Pass between now and some currently unspecified future point, including Stardew Valley and nefarious management sequel Evil Genius 2.
Stardew Valley developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone popped up midway through tonight&#x27;s showcase for a bit of a natter, confirming toward the end of the segment that his much-loved village life sim would be heading to Game Pass for PC and Xbox some time this autumn.
Also still awaiting a Game Pass arrival date is the adorable Pupperazzi, a first-person photography game that - as you may have already surmised from its title - tasks players with taking cute snaps of (and petting!) canines as they go about their doggy lives in a colourful holiday paradise. As with most of the below, details on specific Game Pass platforms weren&#x27;t shared during the show, but I&#x27;ll update the story if any clarification is forthcoming.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been eyeing up Player Unknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds (or PUBG: Battlegrounds as its new marvellously redundant moniker would have it) for the last four years but somehow still haven&#x27;t quite convinced yourself to pick give it a go, you might be interested to know you can currently play the one-time battle royale phenomenon for free on PC.
PUBG: Battlegrounds&#x27; Free Play Week is now underway on Steam, giving interested parties to chance to play all available modes and maps until next Monday, 16th August. That, of course, includes PUBG&#x27;s new Taego map, whisking players players back to 1980s South Korea. 
Taego - PUBG&#x27;s first 8x8km map since 2017&#x27;s Miramar - is notable for a number of key new features, including self-revive and the new Gulag-esque Comeback BR mechanic. The latter gives players that die prior to the first Blue Zone the chance to respawn if they can survive against other players in a separate Comeback Arena.

                    <span>Team Fortress 2, it&#x27;s fair to say, is getting on a bit. The 14-year-old game remains incredibly popular on Steam, but over the past year it&#x27;s hit the headlines for the wrong reasons, with bot problems that show no sign of disappearing. (Although we got to witness players conga-ing their way past the bots, at least.) 
In any case, it seems the community has finally taken it upon themselves to give Team Fortress 2 a refresh, as a group of modders called Amper Software has started recreating the game in Garry&#x27;s Mod spiritual successor s&amp;box. The reason for this: they wondered what Team Fortress 2 would look like in Valve&#x27;s newest engine, Source 2. 
&quot;Ever since Source 2 was first mentioned publicly as an engine that Valve was working on, a lot of people in the Team Fortress 2 community have started asking the question: if Valve ever ports TF2 to Source 2, what would it look like? How different gameplay would be? And would TF2 even feel the same?,&quot; the team explained in a blog post. &quot;...s&amp;box, the spiritual successor of Garry&#x27;s Mod made on the Source 2 engine, has been released as part of a dev preview to a group of community members, including ourselves. It, pretty much, like Garry&#x27;s Mod itself, allows you to build whatever you want using the toolset that it provides. So we&#x27;ve decided to not lose that chance.&quot;

                    <span>EA Sports has reduced the weekly match requirements for FIFA 22 Ultimate Team&#x27;s Division Rivals mode, and leaned more heavily on the seasons model.
Division Rivals - the most popular mode in Ultimate Team - pits players against each other in ranked matches.
With FIFA 21, EA implemented a cap on the number of games that contribute to the Weekly Score accumulation in Division Rivals. After completing your first 30 games of FIFA 21&#x27;s Rivals, the matches stop adding to your Weekly Score.

                    <span>FIFA 22 will for the first time in the series let you turn off opponent celebrations.
Celebrations have been a long-standing conduit for toxic behaviour in competitive FIFA. Your opponent is forced to watch them - and they can be pretty grating after rage-inducing goals are scored.
With FIFA 21, EA pulled the Shush and A-OK celebrations from the game. The Shush celebration in particular was infamous within the community as it was done while the scoring player was running. (Players sometimes use running celebrations to extend the celebration time as they jog up and down the pitch - a frustrating time-wasting tactic.)

                    <span>Ever since Nintendo Switch emulation became viable on PC a few years ago, modders have been tinkering away, improving many visual aspects of Switch games.
Now, German modder Digital Dreams (thanks, Kotaku) has released a showcase of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild running at 8K resolution with ray-tracing, and it looks absolutely stunning.
Using post-processing injector Reshade, Digital Dreams was able to create a ray-tracing preset for the game and manipulate the colour hue to give it an added sparkle. Depth of field has also been retouched and greater draw distances have been added.

                    <span>Iron Gate has served up a few more morsels of information about upcoming Valheim update Hearth and Home, and this time, it&#x27;s all about changes to the game&#x27;s food system. The way snacking works is being given an overhaul - and it looks like some food items are getting a nerf in the process. Ah crumbs. 
In the game&#x27;s current form, simply shoving some food in your mouth will result in (somewhat) even amounts of health and stamina, but the system arriving in Hearth and Home will change that. Food will soon be divided into three categories: items that provide more health, items that provide more stamina, and items that provide an even split. As explained in the video below, that means you can bulk up on meat and HP before a big battle - or slurp down a stew to increase your stamina for an afternoon of building. 
The different categories will be marked by a coloured fork icon, with red indicating a focus on health, yellow for stamina, and white for a balanced meal. The food bar is also being replaced by a timer system to indicate how long the foods will last.

                    <span>Take-Two Interactive is attempting to shut down Ozark, a popular mod menu for Grand Theft Auto Online. 
As you would expect from a mod menu, Ozark lets modders manipulate the game, both in the campaign and online, to their liking, allowing them to teleport, instakill, spawn vehicles, drop money, and more. 
While modding single player games has some legal ambiguity (Take-Two also seems determined to make all forms of modding illegal), modding multiplayer sessions is detrimental to the experience of other players.

Similar to the C64 Mini - which Retro Games Ltd also produced - this is a reimagining of the 16-bit Commodore personal computer, touting emulation of the original A500 chipset and the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) of later Amiga model the A1200.
The A500 Mini comes with both a mouse and gamepad, as well as support for a plugging in a standard keyboard over USB, since we imagine the keys on the mini system itself are too dinky to use.

EFF writes:
There are two main features that the company is planning to install in every Apple device. One is a scanning feature that will scan all photos as they get uploaded into iCloud Photos to see if they match a photo in the database of known child sexual abuse material (CSAM) maintained by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC). The other feature scans all iMessage images sent or received by child accounts — that is, accounts designated as owned by a minor — for sexually explicit material, and if the child is young enough, notifies the parent when these images are sent or received. This feature can be turned on or off by parents...</span>

The stable version of CSI Proxy for Windows has been released alongside Kubernetes 1.22.  CSI Proxy enables CSI Drivers running on Windows nodes to perform privileged storage operations.
Background
Container Storage Interface (CSI) for Kubernetes went GA in the Kubernetes 1.13 release. CSI has become the standard for exposing block and file storage to containerized workloads on Container Orchestration systems (COs) like Kubernetes. It enables third-party storage providers to write and deploy plugins without the need to alter the core Kubernetes codebase. Legacy in-tree drivers are deprecated and new storage features are introduced in CSI, therefore it is important to get CSI Drivers to work on Windows.

                    <span>Author: Elana Hashman (Red Hat)
The 1.22 release introduced alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for
Kubernetes workloads on a per-node basis.
In prior releases, Kubernetes did not support the use of swap memory on Linux,
as it is difficult to provide guarantees and account for pod memory utilization
when swap is involved. As part of Kubernetes&#x27; earlier design, swap support was
considered out of scope, and a kubelet would by default fail to start if swap
was detected on a node.
However, there are a number of use cases
that would benefit from Kubernetes nodes supporting swap, including improved
node stability, better support for applications with high memory overhead but
smaller working sets, the use of memory-constrained devices, and memory
flexibility.
Hence, over the past two …</span>

                    <span>Psyonix&#x27;s four-wheeled footie game Rocket League kicks off its fourth season this Wednesday, 11th August, and the developer has outlined its key new additions - including the striking Deadeye Canyon arena - ahead of release.
There&#x27;s admittedly not a whole lot to report on the new arena yet - although you can get a long-distance glimpse below - but there&#x27;re a few more details to share ahead of Season 4. Come Wednesday&#x27;s launch, for instance, Rocket League players will be able to enjoy expanded competitive tournaments including Extra and 2v2, with the latter appearing in the first of Season 4&#x27;s limited-time modes: 2v2 Heatseeker.
This gets underway on 12th August and will be followed by Speed Demon - a &quot;super-fast LTM [combining] mutators, the speed of Boomer Ball without the wild bounces, demos on contact, and a fast respawn timer&quot; - and then Spring Loaded due later this month.

                    <span>Forza Horizon 5, the latest instalment in Playground Games&#x27; sublime open-world racing series is a few short months away from release, and with the hype handle now beginning to crank in earnest, the developer has offered a first look at the game&#x27;s sprawling Mexico-themed map.
You can see the map, with its tantalising tangle of roadways and landmarks below, but Playground has also given a bit of a guided tour in its latest video (start at the 27-minute mark).
As creative director Mike Brown reiterates, Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s map will be 50% bigger than that of its UK-set predecessor, providing ample room for its previously announced 11 biomes, which include tropical and rocky coastlines, living and sandy deserts, winding canyons, arid hills, lush farmland, river-strewn jungles, swampland, and the vibrant city streets of Guanajuato - all beneath the gargantuan volcano that lies at the centre of the map.

                    <span>Following its launch on PC and Switch last year, I Am Dead, the acclaimed afterlife puzzler from developers Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg (who&#x27;ve previously worked on the likes of Hohokum and Wilmot&#x27;s Warehouse) is now available for Xbox and PlayStation.
I Am Dead, which is published by Annapurna Interactive, casts players as recently deceased museum curator Morris Lupton, who, with a little help from his equally non-corporeal dog Sparky, must save his tiny island home of Shelmerston from volcanic destruction.
It&#x27;s a thoroughly endearing adventure that plays out a little like a supernatural find-the-object game as players investigate the islanders&#x27; memories and use Morris&#x27; ghostly vision to twirl, slice, and probe the beautiful diorama-style innards of objects around him.

Overcooked, which tasks players with working together to frantically assemble meals and fulfil customer orders within a time limit (while also trying to navigate the peculiarities of some wildly impractical kitchens at the same time), initially launched on 3rd August 2016 - and has been causing heated arguments with loved-ones ever since.
On the game&#x27;s actual fifth birthday last Monday, Ghost Town announced it would be releasing some free anniversary treats for owners of Overcooked: All You Can Eat (the recently released remaster bundle of Overcooked 1, 2, and its DLC) and the update has now arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

                    <span>Ninja Theory&#x27;s 2017 action-adventure, Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice, is now optimised for the Xbox Series X/S. 
The news was announced in a trailer full of gameplay but light on the exact details of the optimisations. 
A more detailed look at the changes are detailed here. Both consoles have three graphics modes: &quot;Performance&quot;, &quot;Resolution&quot;, and &quot;Enriched&quot;.

                    <span>It seems we&#x27;ll be waiting a little longer for cross-progression to finally be implemented in Apex Legends, as Respawn has confirmed the feature will not arrive until next year. 
Director of communications Ryan K. Rigney explained in a Reddit AMA that the feature was &quot;gnarly as hell in terms of being a problem to solve,&quot; citing technical and logistical difficulties as being two reasons for the long wait. 
&quot;It&#x27;s not only that you have to solve the technical challenge of merging existing accounts, but there are also legal and contractual issues to navigate with purchasing on other platforms,&quot; he explained. &quot;Different regions have different laws. It&#x27;s a mess. But we&#x27;re working on it, and we&#x27;re committed to delivering it.&quot;

                    <span>Netflix has given us our best look yet at The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, the upcoming animated prequel to its live-action series.
Today&#x27;s new, two-minute trailer gives us a glimpse at its star Vesemir as a young boy undergoing Witcher training, before the action moves on to some of the monster slaying and questing we&#x27;ve gotten glimpses of already.
As you&#x27;d expect, there are bathtubs and coins and beasts aplenty. Let&#x27;s watch:

                    <span>F1 2021 has had quite a volatile release on PlayStation 5. 
Back in July, Codemasters released a patch that temporarily disabled ray-tracing to aid the game&#x27;s stability. Since patch 1.05, this has been fixed and ray-tracing has been reinstated. 
But now with its latest patch, 1.06, another PS5-specific feature has been removed: 3D Audio.

All of that extra work appears to be paying off, though. We&#x27;ve played a fair bit of Humankind now, and Eurogamer&#x27;s strategy buff Chris Tapsell reckons it has &quot;that special something&quot; in both its mechanics and ambition.

                    <span>This year&#x27;s controversial and disrupted Olympic Games have now concluded - and as the BBC finishes its coverage, the broadcaster has given viewers a tour behind the scenes of its virtual studio. 
Fortnite gets a namecheck in the explainer video below, hosted by the BBC&#x27;s Dan Walker and Sam Quek, as it&#x27;s revealed how everything except the presenters&#x27; chairs and table was a creation of Unreal Engine. 
Unreal Engine is commonly used in film and TV production either to create virtual studios or surroundings, or to mock up in real-time how an effects-based shot might look with live-action actors in frame.

                    <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky is celebrating five (extremely eventful) years since launch today, and developer Hello Games has served up a tiny tease for the exploratory space sim&#x27;s next big update, Frontiers, as part of the festivities.
While No Man&#x27;s Sky soothing exploratory rhythm certainly found its fans at launch on 9th August 2016, its arrival was infamously marked by immediate and sustained controversy when players discovered some of the features discussed prior to its release were absent from the final game. Hello Games has embarked on a truly staggering post-launch development journey since then, and has now put out a total of 16 named - and in some cases utterly transformative - updates for the ever-expanding space sim.
We&#x27;ve seen the introduction of base building, bobbleheads, farming, cross-platform multiplayer, VR support, giant customisable space freighters, land and water vehicles, pilotable mechs, living ships, alien-infested space derelicts, new flora and fauna, pets, live-service-style community expeditions, music tools, major overhauls to the game&#x27;s planetary generation tech, spicy visual enhancements for new-gen consoles, sand worms (finally!), and more.

In an FAQ thread in the studio&#x27;s official Discord server, it stated: &quot;We do not have plans to have a campaign versus mode at this time&quot;.  
Back 4 Blood does have a versus mode, allowing two teams to take it in turns to fight each other as the Cleaners and the Ridden. But there is no campaign level akin to Left 4 Dead, where players would have to fight through player-controlled zombies to get to the safe house.

In 2008, with Duke Nukem Forever in development hell, artist Gregor Punchatz headed up a Gearbox-commissioned project at Dallas, Texas-based production studio Janimation to create an animated vertical slice to show what Duke Nukem Begins was meant to be.
The video shows third-person shooting, with Duke killing various demons using familiar weapons in an urban setting. We also see four-player co-op. There&#x27;s a big boss fight at the end, with Duke flying around using a jet-pack. Yes, that&#x27;s Guerrilla Radio by Rage Against the Machine.

Sega&#x27;s wonderful 1999 arcade racing game first launched with prominent product placement, including destinations modelled after real-life brands such as Pizza Hut, KFC, Tower Records and FILA. Remember FILA? There was a time FILA trainers were all the rage. I remember.
The original arcade version of Crazy Taxi and its initial ports to Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, GameCube and PC included this product placement, but when it came to the 2010 release on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the 2011 release on Steam, the brands were replaced by fakes.

The concert experience was available four times over the weekend, and seemed to pass smoothly with no technical issues or server hiccups. As each concert time neared, Fortnite slowly disabled its core match playlists and players assembled in its special Rift Tour mode.
Once inside, players were left to hang out on top of the island&#x27;s central UFO with friends or random players, with a few little bits and pieces to play around with. The video recap below picks up after this, just as the event&#x27;s countdown clock hits zero:

One of the most anticipated games of the year, Back 4 Blood is being developed by Turtle Rock Studios, famed for its creation of the Left 4 Dead series.

They received no test credentials, configuration details, or other information about the machine.

                    <span>There&#x27;s reportedly a new South Park game in development.
According to Bloomberg, a recent deal struck between South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and ViacomCBS - allegedly valued at around $900 million (£648m) over six years - seals several new series and &quot;spinoff movies&quot; for streaming service, Paramount+.
The story also references a new &quot;3D video game that is set in the world of South Park&quot;, which will seemingly be developed not in collaboration with Ubisoft or its partners this time, but is instead underway at an &quot;in-house studio&quot;.

                    <span>The Medium developer Bloober Team has released a new video detailing how its transition to PS5 will make use of the DualSense&#x27;s haptic controller.
Given much of Marianne&#x27;s adventure is steeped in atmospheric sound and environmental storytelling, Bloober hopes to build on that by making the experience even more immersive thanks to the PS5&#x27;s responsive controller that it says will act as &quot;an extension of your senses&quot;.

                    <span>The Steam Deck will allegedly perform in exactly the same way whether it&#x27;s docked or not.
In an interview with PC Gamer, Greg Coomer - who helped design Valve&#x27;s new handheld system - said the team felt it was &quot;actually better, all things considered, to not modify based on docked status or mobile status&quot;.
This means that players should not experience a dip in performance if they&#x27;re playing on the move, which makes it stand out from its chief competitor, the Nintendo Switch.

                    <span>A rare, sealed copy of Super Mario Bros. has sold for $2 million (£1.44m).
The record-breaking sale comes just a few weeks after a pristine sealed copy of Super Mario 64 sold for $1.56m (£1.12m), breaking the then-record for the highest amount anyone has paid for a video game.
It&#x27;s the latest in a line of high-profile auctions. According to the New York Times (£), this particular lot - a rare unopened copy of the original Super Mario Bros. for NES - was sold by Rally, a company that helps investors buy and sell shares in collectible assets.

                    <span>GTA 5 parent company Take-Two Interactive has confirmed it has three &quot;unannounced&quot; remasters or remakes underway.
The news came courtesy of Take-Two&#x27;s recent Q1 2022 earnings call (thanks, Resetera). Nestled at the bottom of a slide called &quot;Pipeline Details (as of 18th May, 2021)&quot;, the company said it had six &quot;new iterations of previously released titles&quot; in development.
Three were specified and already public knowledge - Grand Theft Auto 5: Expanded and Enhanced and Kerbal Space Program for current-gen systems, plus a standalone version GTA 5&#x27;s fan-favourite Grand Theft Auto Online - but three remain unknown.

                    <span>New World Interactive&#x27;s hardcore multiplayer tactical shooter Insurgency Sandstorm seemingly - and finally - has a release date on console: 29th September 2021.
&quot;Insurgency Sandstorm is coming to PS4 and Xbox!&quot; Maximum Games UK - a self-described &quot;boutique&quot; publisher - announced on Twitter. &quot;Engage in realistic modern firefights in the definitive tactical FPS! Battle in the war-torn environments of a contemporary conflict through a series of cooperative and multiplayer modes.&quot;
Interestingly, the tweet itself doesn&#x27;t give a release date and the brief video teaser included in the tweet only hints at a &quot;2021&quot; release, but the pre-order link takes us to UK games retailer GAME, and it&#x27;s here the specific date is given.

                    <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn has confirmed new character Seer will be nerfed &quot;in an upcoming patch&quot;.
Respawn&#x27;s Travis Nordin told participants in a Reddit AMA that while the Legend had &quot;brought a lot of new gameplay elements to the game&quot;, Seer&#x27;s particular skillset is &quot;a bit too strong&quot;.
As Emma explained earlier this week, complaints about how Seer&#x27;s abilities give him too much of an advantage in combat were piling up on the Apex subreddit. Many of these complaints are centred on Seer&#x27;s microdrones, which allows him to disrupt revives and shield battery regens.
