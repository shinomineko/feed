                              <span>The upcoming free-to-play skateboard sim, Skate, will be available on PC via Steam.
The news was confirmed by lead creative writer Cuz Parry, who revealed that the fan-favourite skating game would be coming to PC via Steam for the very first time in a Q&amp;A video posted to YouTube just a couple of days before the holidays.
As PC Gamer points out, the news went largely unnoticed at the time, so it was only when the social media team confirmed it was &quot;stoked to announce Skate will be available on Steam for PC players&quot; earlier this week that news began to spread.

                              <span>Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann says he has a &quot;concept&quot; ready for a third and final chapter of The Last of Us series.
Talking at the very end of the fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, Druckmann acknowledged that whilst he didn&#x27;t yet have a story fully fleshed out, he did have a kernel of an idea that &quot;is as exciting as [The Last of Us Part 1]&quot;.
&quot;If we never get to do it again, this is a fine ending point. The last bite of the apple, the story&#x27;s done,&quot; Druckmann said.

That&#x27;s according to podcaster Moore&#x27;s Law is Dead, who stated earlier this week that Microsoft was &quot;seriously, seriously shopping around with Intel and even NVIDIA apparently for their next-gen console&quot;.
&quot;As of one month ago, no next-gen contract with AMD had been signed with Microsoft,&quot; they said.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bit of bad news if, like us, you were quietly hoping Citizen Sleeper 2 might just squeak out before the end of 2024; developer Jump Over The Age has confirmed there&#x27;s still &quot;around a year left of development&quot; on its eagerly anticipated narrative sci-fi RPG sequel. 


Jump Over The Age - AKA developer Gareth Damian Martin - announced they were working on a follow-up to the hugely well-received Citizen Sleeper back in June last year. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, as the sequel is known, introduces a brand-new Sleeper android protagonist in a new setting where players will need to build themselves a life among the stars, piloting their own ramshackle stolen ship populated by a crew they&#x27;ve recruited themselves.


An update in August gave us a first look at a new location in Citizen Sleeper 2 - a bustling way station known as Hexport - as well as confirmation it&#x27;ll be releasing for PC via both Game Pass and Steam. What we didn&#x27;t get, though, was any hint of  an ETA for Citizen Sleeper 2 - and that&#x27;s where Jump Over The Age&#x27;s lastest update comes in.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced another delay for its ambitious Sims-like Life By You, which is now due to enter Steam and Epic Games Store early access on 4th June.


Life By You, the first game from Paradox&#x27;s Tectonic studio (headed up by former Sims boss and Second Life CEO Rod Humble), was officially unveiled last March, promising a game that would let players &quot;create humans and live out their lives without loading screens&quot;.


It is, essentially, the Sims, albeit with a few key selling points intended to differentiate it from the current iteration of EA&#x27;s juggernaut franchise: it&#x27;s fully open-world with no loading screens, it features &quot;real language conversation&quot;, its digital human can optionally be controlled directly in first-person, and &quot;everything is customisable&quot;. It also sports a more realistic art style compared to the Sims 4, which, last year at least, unfortunately looked both drab and bland.

O&#x27;Hara, whose expansive career includes playing eccentric matriarch Moira Rose on Schitt&#x27;s Creek and Kate McCallister in the Home Alone films, will play an undisclosed character in HBO&#x27;s adaptation. However, previous rumours suggested she will have a recurring role as an all-new character known as Gail.
O&#x27;Hara joins Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie, Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel, Kaitlyn Dever&#x27;s Abby, Young Mazino&#x27;s Jesse, and Isabela Merced&#x27;s Dina for the second season of The Last of Us.

                              <span>As acclaimed first-person automation sim Satisfactory inches closer to the fifth anniversary of its early access launch, developer Coffee Stain Studios has revealed it&#x27;s eyeing up a version 1.0 release &quot;this year&quot;, and that the game has now sold over 5.5m copies.


Satisfactory released into early access back in March 2019 - initially as an Epic Games Store exclusive before making the jump to Steam the following year - and it quickly made a splash thanks its co-operative, open-world spin on the automated resource exploitation loop popularised by deeloper Wube Software&#x27;s much-loved Factorio.


In Satisfatory, Factorio&#x27;s irresistably compulsive fundamental formula - in which, essentially, you mine stuff to craft stuff that&#x27;ll make mining more stuff easier so you can craft bigger stuff and so on - plays in first-person across a vibrant, explorable sci-fi open-world, with up to four friends able to work together to achieve their goals. It&#x27;s a twist that&#x27;s clearly resonated with people too, as developer Coffee Stain has now revealed Satisfactory has sold over 5.5m copies since early access began.

                              <span>Jim Carrey is set to return as Dr. Robotnik in the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film.


Carrey starred as the infamous villain (Eggman, if you must) in the first two films and is now confirmed to reprise the role (thanks Variety) despite fan theories about the fate of the character.


A teaser on the Sonic the Hedgehog film account features a laugh from the villain, hinting at his return. &quot;You all thought I was gone, but I&#x27;ve just been underground,&quot; it reads. &quot;What you&#x27;ve seen from me is only a shadow of things to come...&quot;

The report was published by German PC gaming outlet GameStar and YouTube channel Game Two earlier this week, and is based on testimonies from 16 former Fntastic employees, one volunteer, and seven employees at publisher Mytona.
The claims paint a bleak image of the working environment at Fntastic, which include allegations of toxic management, in particular co-founders Eduard and Aysen Gotovtsev, and a lack of direction.

                              <span>InnerSloth and CBS Studios have shared a small teaser for their upcoming Among Us animated series.


While it doesn&#x27;t give too much away, the image shows an empty cafeteria with pizzas and balloons adorned by a banner that reads: &quot;We&#x27;re not dead&quot;. 
Well, I presume it should be read that way anyway. However, a nice big splash of red blood has covered up the middle word, leaving only &#x27;We&#x27;re&#x27; and &#x27;Dead&#x27; on show. Seems kind of sus...

                              <span>Infamous Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser believes the company used him as an example, and says his prison sentence and fine are designed to send a message to others who cross the company in the future.
To quickly recap, Bowser was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices back in 2022. The Canadian programmer had worked as part of a larger hacking group known as Team Xecuter, which in turn made millions from the sale of devices which enabled pirated video games to be played on a number of Nintendo&#x27;s consoles. At the time of his sentence, Bowser pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, as well as an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo&#x27;s own civil lawsuit against him.
Bowser was subsequently released from prison last year, however he will remain in debt to Nintendo for decades to come. In April, Bowser said Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.

                              <span>The boss of indie publisher Devolver Digital has stepped down with immediate effect, following yesterday&#x27;s confirmation of layoffs at the company&#x27;s Artificer studio. 


Outgoing CEO Douglas Morin departed &quot;as part of planning for Devolver&#x27;s long-term growth and development&quot;, the company said in a statement. He has been replaced by Harry Miller, a Devolver co-founder who served as CEO previously.


Devolver announced yesterday that 28 people are set to lose their jobs at the Polish-based Artificer this year, the majority of which will depart this month.

That&#x27;s now been confirmed by both the Hasbro-owned Wizards of the Coast and Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke, of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 fame.


According to a report by Pandaily, Hasbro was seeking to sell the IP with Tencent as a potential buyer and Larian Studios acting as an intermediary - 30 percent of the developer is owned by Tencent.

The numbers back up the positive reception Infinite Wealth has had from players. The game also had the series&#x27; biggest Steam launch ever, racking up over 45,000 concurrent players at peak.

PlayStation Game Size has revealed the download size of the game from the back-end of the PlayStation Store, as well as the existence of a Rebirth demo in which players will earn the in-game item Kupo Charm - Survival Set.



PlayStation will be hosting another State of Play next week dedicated solely to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth with an &quot;extensive look&quot; at the game and &quot;exciting news you won&#x27;t want to miss&quot;. Could this include an immediate demo, or at least a release date for one?

                              <span>Last week, developer Tango Gameworks distributed a relatively minor Hi-Fi Rush update to celebrate the first anniversary of the acclaimed rhythm-brawler&#x27;s release; however, dataminers poking around the update&#x27;s innards are now claiming to have found further evidence - in the form of unique t-shirt designs - that a PlayStation and Switch launch is on the way.


Reports that the previously PC and Xbox exclusive Hi-Fi Rush could be making its way to PlayStation and Switch first began circulating in January, after a number of reliable leakers started expanding on claims by insider Nate the Hate that Microsoft was set to &quot;one of [its] more acclaimed first party releases to a competitor system&quot; this year.


And while there&#x27;s been no sign of an official announcement to back up those reports in the weeks since, datamined discoveries in Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s latest update (thanks Wario64) have lent further credence to the rumours. Patch 7, as last week&#x27;s update is officially known, includes an Anniversary T-Shirt Bundle containing new clothing for Chai to wear. Four of these designs are available to everyone, while three are exclusive to the platform - Xbox, Steam, or the Epic Games Store - players own the game on. However, a number of dataminers are now claiming to have unearthed two additional, unused T-shirts in the update, looking suspiciously like exclusive designs for Switch and PlayStation.

                              <span>Inkle, the studio behind the acclaimed likes of Heaven&#x27;s Vault and last year&#x27;s A Highland Song, has just surprise-released The Forever Labyrinth, a free browser-based narrative adventure spanning the entire history of art from across the world.


The Forever Labyrinth, which has been made in partnership with the Google Arts &amp; Culture initiative, transports players to an ever-shifting maze of rooms - resembling everything from serene gardens to clifftops, forests, and cellars - as they search for their friend Professor Sheldrake, who&#x27;s lost amid its mysterious interlinking passageways.


These passageways take the form of paintings and art - &quot;drawn from the collections of great museums who are keen to share their treasures in new and exciting ways online&quot;, as the press release puts it - scattered around each room. By collecting clues and identifying elements present within the artwork, players can learn to navigate the labyrinth and hopefully find their friend - if the monster ceaselessly devouring the world doesn&#x27;t get them first.

                              <span>Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Abubakar Salim - who voiced Bayek in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins and starred in HBO&#x27;s Raised by Wolves - now has a demo on Steam ahead of its PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch release this April.


Tales of Kenzera, a Metroidvania-style side-scrolling action-adventure, was unveiled by Salim during an emotional appearance at last year&#x27;s The Game Awards in which he paid tribute to his late father. &quot;For a long time,&quot; he explained, &quot;I&#x27;ve struggled to find a way of communicating my journey with grief. To now be able to do that through Zau&#x27;s story of loss, growth and healing in Tales of Kenzera: Zau feels so right.&quot;


Taking inspiration from African Bantu tales, the game - which is being developed by Salim&#x27;s Surgent Studios and published by EA via its Originals label - follows the journey of Zau, a young shaman who bargains with the God of death to bring his Baba back from darkness.

                              <span>Following a cautious, gradual roll-out to stop everything blowing up in a tangle of lost progress and Tenno tears, developer Digital Extremes has announced that free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe&#x27;s long-awaited cross-platform save feature is now available to all players.


Digital Extremes has been slowly working away on Warframe&#x27;s cross-platform support for a number of years now; cross-play was first introduced back in December 2022, while cross-save - enabling players to pick up where they left off regardless of the platform they&#x27;re playing on - starting rolling out in December last year.


At the time, Digital Extremes explained it would be taking a cautious approach and introducing cross-save in phases, to avoid risking timeouts caused by high demand - something that could potentially be catastrophic for a feature as sensitive as account merging. Since then, it&#x27;s been rolling out cross-save support to players in batches, but today brings the news it&#x27;ll now be immediately available to anyone that wants to take advantage of the feature.

In short, her exclusivity deal with the Amazon-owned streaming platform came to an end and Pokimane decided not to renew the contract. &quot;The end of an era,&quot; she posted on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;Twitch has been my home for a decade...but it&#x27;s time to say thank you for all the memories and love during my League, Fortnite, and Among Us days.&quot;


It means Twitch - a platform derided for its lack of diversity - has just lost one of its most popular and high profile female streamers and, on her podcast series Don&#x27;t Tell Anyone, she detailed her concerns about the platform.

The demo lets you play through four levels from the first world - three in which Mario collects the toys, and one where you get to lead the Mini-Marios to a toy box.
Nintendo has also released a new overview trailer for the game to coincide with the demo.

                              <span>If you have been wanting to play Alan Wake 2, but were put off by the game&#x27;s semi-regular, flashing jump scares, I have good news. 


As part of its recent update, Remedy has added a feature that will allow you to tone down those horror flashes (apparently a much-requested addition). Players can now opt for either a Low or Normal visual and audio intensity of horror flash, to curate the game better to their liking. 


Along with this option to dial back on the scaries, the studio has also introduced a Chapter Select function. This will allow players to load up any mission they fancy as long as they have previously unlocked it. Yes, this means you can go back and replay Alan Wake 2&#x27;s awesome musical moments again and again and again.

&quot;Yesterday, Devolver and studio Artificer made the tough decision to reduce the Artificer workforce by 28 employees, 18 effective immediately and 10 after their current project releases,&quot; it told us. 
&quot;Over the past year, both companies have worked together to navigate the studio&#x27;s difficulties to ensure Artificer remains open and that their hard work is realised with the launch of their next game. Layoffs are not easy, and the remaining team at Artificer and Devolver Digital are committed to supporting these talented and creative professionals find new roles throughout the industry.&quot;

                              <span>Foamstars will arrive on PlayStation Plus next week, but before then Square Enix has detailed what&#x27;s in store for the game&#x27;s first season.


Starry Pop is its name, reflecting the game&#x27;s music and idol themes, with season one detailed on the PlayStation Blog.



As previously reported, the game will have both a free and paid season pass (£4.99), with the premium version offering early access to new content and additional cosmetic rewards. We now know Square Enix has updates planned for the next year, with seasons updating each month.

Given the mysterious nature of the Blue Hole, where Dave the Diver is set, it&#x27;s not surprising that it&#x27;s prone to visits from the famous sea monster.
Developer Mintrocket hasn&#x27;t said much on how Godzilla will fit into the game, other than telling players to &quot;prepare to meet the King of the Monsters in the Blue Hole&quot;. Godzilla makes his appearance at the end of the announcement trailer for Dave the Diver&#x27;s PlayStation release.

                              <span>At last night&#x27;s State of Play, Vertigo Games and Deep Silver lifted the lid on Metro Awakening, an upcoming origin story for the Metro series.


The game is described as a story-driven adventure, built exclusively for VR. It promises plenty of stealth and a good dash of combat, with the developer stating this will be the &quot;most immersive&quot; Metro experience to date. 


You will play as Serdar in Metro Awakening. Serdar is &quot;a doctor and a rationalist&quot; in search of medication for his wife. This search will take players to the tunnels beneath Moscow, but it won&#x27;t be an easy trip. You see, the tunnels are full of mutants.  &quot;As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become...&quot; the official blurb teases. You can see Metro Awakening&#x27;s announcement trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good long while since we&#x27;ve seen anything concrete from Konami and developer Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 remake, but the project has now received a fresh airing as part of Sony&#x27;s latest PlayStation State of Play showcase, this time with a trailer focusing on the game&#x27;s &quot;improved and modernised&quot; combat.


Combat perhaps isn&#x27;t the first thing you&#x27;d expect Konami&#x27;s marketing material to dwell on given it&#x27;s quite some way down the list of elements that made the original Silent Hill 2 such a beloved horror experience, but the trailer does, in fairness, hang back a whole 40 seconds before switching out the atmospheric meandering for bat-swinging, shotgun-blasting action.


Additionally, it&#x27;s reassuring, and perhaps even a little surprising, to see just how closely Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 remake hews to aesthetic of the original 2001 PlayStation 2 game - it certainly doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;re in for a radical tonal reinvention here.

                              <span>During this evening&#x27;s State of Play, we were all treated to a brand new and rather surreal look at Death Stranding 2, officially now known as On the Beach (as suspected). 


The sequel was first announced to be in development back in 2022 during the Game Awards, with a  bamboozling trailer featuring Léa Seydoux and Norman Reedus.


Tonight&#x27;s trailer has now given us another slice of Kojima-infused pie, and once again it is as perplexing as you would expect. It includes a rather epic looking battle that I won&#x27;t spoil by trying to describe it here. We also got a brief look at Elle Fanning&#x27;s Death Stranding 2 character. The actress was first confirmed to be part of the sequel a while ago, after a series of enigmatic teases from Kojima (although, we all guessed).

                              <span>PlayStation has announced Physint, a major new project with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima, to &quot;reinvent&quot; the genre he is most famous for. 


This new &quot;next-generation action espionage game&quot; will be a fresh, original IP - as Metal Gear Solid remains owned by Konami - and will also be a movie as well.


&quot;Preparations are udnerway, but production will begin in earnest at Kojima Productions after Death Stranding 2,&quot; Kojima said tonight during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play - during which we also learned Death Stranding 2 is set to arrive in 2025.

                              <span>Supermassive Games&#x27; hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is - as was widely reported prior today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play showcase - getting a PlayStation 5 and PC remaster, and it&#x27;ll be launching later this year.


The original Until Dawn released for PlayStation 4 back in 2015, offering up an atmospheric, knowingly cheesy spin on the teen slasher genre whose branching narrative could be nudged in different directions depending on the choices players made - with their actions determining who lived and who died, even what sort of threat they might be facing. 


Supermassive later returned to the well with its similarly styled Dark Pictures Anthology series, but Until Dawn is still regarded as highpoint for the studio, so it&#x27;s nice to see it get a bit of a refresh - or &quot;rebuilt and enhanced&quot; as Sony is putting it - for a new generation of players.

                              <span>Tonight brought a fresh look at Judas, the first new game from BioShock creator Ken Levine in over a decade, and the first ever to come from his studio Ghost Story Games.


A new trailer shown during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play suggested Judas was set in a futuristic world where everyone&#x27;s thoughts are recorded - and shown off on a series of screens. 


All these thoughts are &quot;planted in your brain like weeds in a garden&quot;, a character who looks slightly similar to BioShock Infinite&#x27;s Elizabeth suggests, revealing that she&#x27;s going to help free people from this.

The Short Message - which first surfaced in September 2022 via a South Korea ratings board listing - made its formal debut during tonight&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play showcase, with its announcement trailer revealing a first-person experience focusing on a young woman and featuring heavy interactions with her mobile phone.


&quot;Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new, short-form Silent Hill title, featuring a young, contemporary protagonist,&quot; Konami explains over on the PlayStation Blog. &quot;In 2022, we announced a revival for the Silent Hill series, along with several new titles in development, and this marks the first of that new wave of games to be released.&quot;

Generations featured 2D and 3D levels in a nod to both modern and classic Sonic. Now we&#x27;ll get Shadow levels on top with this new release in autumn this year.

                              <span>With February almost upon us, Sony has revealed the next batch of monthly games it&#x27;s making available to subscribers of its PlayStation Plus Essential tier - and it&#x27;s also announced a two-hour trial of developer Insomniac&#x27;s acclaimed Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 for Premium subscribers.


Starting with the games, February&#x27;s first Essential offering is Foamstars, Square Enix&#x27;s stylish, Splatoon-esque 4v4 live-service game in which players furiously hose each other into submission with a torrent of slippery soapsuds. It&#x27;ll be available on both PlayStation 4 and PS5.


Next up is Rollerdrome, from OlliOlli developer Roll7. Set a world ruled by corporations, where the public is kept placated by a brutal blood sport known as Rollerdrome, it sees players donning rollerskates for some high-speed third-person shooting action, where performing tricks restores ammo and bullet-time-style slo-mo can be deployed against opponents.

                              <span>Palworld - you know, the open-world survival game with the definitely-not-Pokémon you might have heard about once or twice lately - has, less than two weeks after its early access release, officially surpassed 19m players on Xbox Series X/S and PC, with Microsoft now touting it as the biggest third-party launch in Game Pass&#x27; history.


We&#x27;ve known known developer Pocketpair has had a hit on its hands with Palworld for some time now, of course; its early access launch on 19th January got off a bumpy start as an initial influx of players brought the game&#x27;s servers to their knees, and just 24 hours later Pocketpair revealed 2m players were already galavanting around the Palapagos Islands.


Shortly after, Palworld became one of only six games ever to hit 1m concurrent players on Steam, and then updated sales figures brought the news it had shifted over 5m copies in just three days. Six days after launch, Steam sales hit 8m, and now, 12 days in, Pocketpair has announced Palworld has surpassed 19m players.

                              <span>After months of conceptual chatter over on its blog, developer The Chinese Room has finally whipped back the shroud on its version of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, giving a first proper look at its in-game action courtesy of an 15-minute gameplay reveal.


Prior to today, The Chinese Room - which took over the troubled Bloodlines 2 back in 2021, although the studio&#x27;s involvement wasn&#x27;t announced until last year - has talked a little about the game&#x27;s main character, vampire elder Phyre, its clans, and its &quot;visceral immersive combat&quot;, and all of that comes together in today&#x27;s extended gameplay debut.


According to The Chinese Room, this 15-minute first-look features a sequence from relatively early in the game, taking place after Phyre - who in this particular playthrough is part of the Brujah clan, imbuing her with supernatural speed and strength, as well as a rather short fuse - has established herself in Seattle and made inroads with the court. As she investigates the mysterious mark on her hand limiting her powers, she receives a tip-off leading her to a warehouse and a vampire known as Willem who might just have some answers.

Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of 186,892 companies sent data about them to the social network. On average, each participant in the study had their data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied significantly, with some panelists’ data listing over 7,000 companies providing their data. The Markup helped Consumer Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to Consumer Reports...</span>

                              <span>Two weeks after Microsoft&#x27;s turn, it&#x27;s now Sony&#x27;s time in the spotlight. Tonight&#x27;s big PlayStation State of Play broadcast is the first we&#x27;ve heard from Sony this year - and this evening looks set to lay out a line-up of blockbusters coming to PS5 over 2024 - and into 2025.
Join us as we watch and cover everything live from 10pm UK time (GMT) - the show is set to last 40 minutes, and feature 15 games. 
What do we expect? Quite a lot, actually. Sony itself has said to expect &quot;guest appearances from some of the most talented minds in gaming&quot; - and without an invitation ourselves we can only assume this means Hideo Kojima. It&#x27;s high time we heard more about Death Stranding 2. But who else might also qualify? Our money&#x27;s on BioShock creator Ken Levine, whose long-awaited Judas is now finally nearing release.

However, you will also unlock an exclusive dynamic background of the same theme so you can match your console&#x27;s Home screen to your hardware.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil 4 Remake has sold another 1m copies over the past three months, for a total of 6.48m units sold worldwide.


This makes it the fastest selling Resident Evil title &quot;by far&quot; - a stat tracked by Alex Aniel, writer of Itchy Tasty: An Unofficial History of Resident Evil - although the game still sits behind the likes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Village in terms of total sales to date.


In its recent consolidated financial results, Capcom said these more recent Resident Evil 4 sales have been supported by &quot;ongoing promotional measures&quot; such as free updates for the PlayStation VR2 version.

                              <span>The boss of Apex Legends and Battlefield maker EA has been asked about Nintendo Switch 2, ahead of the unannounced console&#x27;s widely-expected launch later this year.


Quizzed on how Switch 2&#x27;s arrival will impact EA, the company&#x27;s CEO Andrew Wilson said he could &quot;absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced or acknowledge it in any way&quot;, before going on to say the company was pumped for &quot;new platforms&quot; in general.


&quot;What I would say,&quot; Wilson told investors, &quot;to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years have come out and offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution... where we&#x27;re able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly around our biggest franchises like FC, like Madden, like Battlefield, like Apex that has typically been very good for our business.

The news has spread following the issue of a Californian WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) notice - required by law to give employees 60 days in advance of sizable layoffs.


Eurogamer can confirm, via the Employment Development Department of the State of California, that two separate layoffs of 12 and 49 staff will take place on 8th March.

                              <span>A group of former Volition developers have joined the development of steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution under the banner of a fresh studio.
Shapeshifter Games has been founded by Volition veterans, following the studio&#x27;s closure last year and poor reception to its Saints Row reboot. Now, LinkedIn profiles of employees have since confirmed Shapeshifter&#x27;s first project (thanks TechRaptor). 
On LinkedIn, Shapeshifter Games stated it is a co-development studio and revealed it was already working &quot;with a top publisher on their next great IP&quot;. Shortly after, inXile Entertainment released a statement announcing its partnership with Shapeshifter to help work on Clockwork Revolution.

One of the main draws of spending £100 on the game&#x27;s deluxe edition was its ability to play from Monday this week, before the game&#x27;s general release on Friday. 


But developer Rocksteady has twice had to take Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#x27;s servers offline to fix problems with the game - leaving the always-online co-op title completely unplayable in the interim.

                              <span>A mobile version of Palworld has appeared on the Apple App Store, said to be coming soon - but it is not the real deal. 


The app, which you can see below in screenshots taken by Eurogamer, appears at first glance to be affiliated with Palworld developer Pocketpair and uses the same promotional images as on PC and Xbox. But this app has nothing to do with Pocketpair, and has instead been published by someone known as Oleksandra Kryccun.


Pocketpair has now said it is aware of this app&#x27;s existence, and warned players not to be fooled by its arrival on the App Store (we&#x27;ve checked, and can&#x27;t see it on the Google Play store at present).

In a new update, assistance features have been added across all six games that allow players to modify the amount of EXP, gil or magic AP they receive, or turn off enemy encounters entirely.


Further, players can switch between the original or newly arranged soundtracks, plus the font type can be switched between modern and classic versions.

                              <span>Microsoft has shared its Q2 2024 financial results, reporting significant revenue gains across its gaming division - including a massive 61 percent increase in Xbox content and services revenue - following its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


As per its Q2 earnings release, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming revenue increased by 49 percent compared to the equivalent quarter in its previous financial year, with the company recording a 61 percent boost in Xbox content and services revenue - which encompasses money generated by the likes of  Game Pass - alongside a three percent increase in Xbox hardware revenue.


Unsurprisingly, Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard acquisition was a key driver of its Q2 growth, with the deal contributing to just over $2bn in revenue. However, operating expenses and other costs - including transaction- and integration-related costs - saw the net impact of the Activision Blizzard deal result in an operating loss of $440m.

                              <span>Following a little under two weeks of Steam beta testing, Starfield&#x27;s latest patch is now available for all players on PC and Xbox Series X/S, bringing quest fixes, visual improvements, and more.


As noted in Bethesda&#x27;s announcement post, Starfield&#x27;s latest update - officially numbered 1.9.51.0 - has received one additional PC crash fix in the jump from beta to full release. That tweak joins &quot;over a hundred fixes and adjustments&quot; detailed in its previous beta patch notes.


For the most part, updated 1.9.51.0 is focused on quality-of-life improvements and quest fixes, with Bethesda saying its quashed instances of bulldozed objects reappearing when returning to an outpost, ship hatches being marked as inaccessible, and more. There&#x27;s also yet another fix intended to stamp out the lingering issue of asteroids doggedly following ships across the galaxy like overly enthusiastic puppies.

                              <span>If your interests exist squarely within the Venn diagram of Mass Effect and Destiny 2, your day is almost here: Bungie has announced it&#x27;s teaming up with EA and BioWare to bring Commander Shepard and company - or at least something vaguely inspired by them - to its free-to-play shooter as part of a new collaboration event.


As per Bungie&#x27;s announcement, the &#x27;Destiny 2 x BioWare&#x27; team-up will enable Destiny 2 players to &quot;join the crew of the Normandy&quot; from 13th February - which all sounds very exciting until it finishes its sentence, &quot;with new cosmetics and in-game items&quot;.


On the premium cosmetics front, a new Normandy Crew Bundle will be available in the Eververse store once the event begins, containing a Commander Shepard-inspired N7 armour set for Titans, a Garrus-inspired Vakarian set for Hunters, and a Liara-inspired Shadow Broker set for Warlocks. An Omni Strike finisher and Flux Dance will also be purchasable with Silver.

                              <span>Hinterland, the developer behind snowy survival game The Long Dark, has teased an &#x27;unannounced survival game&#x27; currently in development at the studio, and the accompanying alpha footage certainly has the hallmarks of a potential The Long Dark 2.


Hinterland boss Raphael van Lierop (who confirmed he was stepping away from The Long Dark to start a new project at the studio back in 2022) shared the 22 seconds of &quot;in-engine pre-alpha&quot; footage on social media today, along with the caption, &quot;Some good things happening in the Unannounced Survival Games space...&quot;.


The video itself is little more than a slow pan across a slightly ramshackle room - but a closer look might just offer some big clues as to the nature of Hinterland&#x27;s new project. A running tally of &quot;days&quot; scrawled on the mirror and the general makeshift dilapidation of the room certainly suggest some kind of disaster has befallen the world outside, while the two roaring fires and the howling wind absolutely bring The Long Dark&#x27;s big freeze to mind.

                              <span>We all knew Nintendo would come after the Palworld Pokémon mod, but its modder has quickly struck back with a new download which replaces Palworld&#x27;s friendly Pals with totally original &quot;legally distinct&quot; and &quot;legit copyright free&quot; pocket creatures.
Last week, YouTuber ToastedShoes took the Palworld&#x27;s close Pokémon comparisons to the extreme, with an unlicensed Pokémon mod. Footage of the mod remained on the internet for about a day, before Nintendo got to work scrubbing it away. 
The Pokémon Company itself soon responded, stating its intent to &quot;investigate and take appropriate measures&quot; regarding anything that could infringe on its copyright. Meanwhile, modding hub Nexus Mods released its own statement confirming it won&#x27;t host Pokémon-themed Palworld mods thanks to the &quot;headache of DMCA/legal threats from Nintendo&quot;.

As a reminder, Suicide Squad is technically out on 2nd February, but early access was included in its Deluxe Edition, which costs £100 / $100.
At 11:22am this morning, developer Rocksteady announced a scheduled maintenance for Suicide Squad beginning at 11:30am. &quot;The game will be offline until maintenance has been completed,&quot; the developer stated, with no estimate of when it&#x27;ll be back online.

                              <span>Nightingale, the upcoming gaslamp fantasy game from Inflexion Games, will get a server stress test this Friday, 2nd February. It&#x27;s a one-day only affair - if that - running from 6pm to 9pm UK time (1pm to 4pm Eastern). 


Randomly selected players who had previously signed up for the test will start receiving access to the game one hour before. Others will then be invited to play in batches. Again, this will be random, so keep an eye out for an email from Steam.


&quot;Our goal is for all players who signed up for the test to be able to participate. How quickly that happens will be dependent on how the test progresses,&quot; Inflexion said, explaining it will granting access in waves to assess how servers handle large amounts of players logging in at the same time and the developer&#x27;s ability to rapidly scale up in response.

                              <span>Following the departure of Mike Ybarra, Blizzard has announced its new president: Activision&#x27;s former general manager of its Call of Duty franchise, Johanna Faries.


Faries&#x27; new position was announced last night, following layoffs at Microsoft last week. Her appointment marks the first new leader of the studio since Microsoft finally purchased Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in October, following almost two years of regulatory approvals and legal wrangling. Her official first day will be next month, on 5th February.


In an email sent to Blizzard staff, Faries acknowledged that her new role at Blizzard may stir up a &quot;range of reactions, questions and even concerns&quot;. The new president noted Activision, Blizzard and indeed King are all &quot;decidedly different companies with distinct games, cultures and communities&quot;, despite being under one umbrella.

&quot;We want it to be &#x27;always on&#x27;,&quot; Warner Bros gaming and streaming boss JB Perrette told Variety. &quot;And the good news is the gaming space is lending itself to that.&quot;

                              <span>Some games can take forever to finish. Hours upon hours can be put into any given title, as players make their steady way to victory. When those credits ultimately roll, the sense of achievement can be a wonderful feeling. 


But, this isn&#x27;t the case with Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, at least right now. In fact, many are finding they have &#x27;completed the game&#x27; even before they take their first step. This is thanks to an issue that has seen those already with their hands on the game logging in to find they have full story completion from the off. 


Developer Rocksteady is aware of this unexpected narrative fast track, and is now in the process of sorting it all out.

                              <span>Fighting and fantasy fans are desperate to see Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s Tifa in Tekken 8, so much so Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada acknowledged it.


Plenty of fans have noted how well suited Tifa would be to the fighting game series, but Harada&#x27;s X (formerly Twitter) post about Rebirth and Tekken 8 booths being next to each other at the Taipei Game Show spurred on fan desires.


&quot;All I&#x27;m gonna say... is what everyone else here is saying... but I&#x27;m gonna say it anyways... because &#x27;Tifa Lockhart&#x27; would be absolutely INCREDIBLE if she made it into &#x27;Tekken 8&#x27; this time Harada-San!!!,&quot; replied one fan.

                              <span>Edmund McMillen has discussed a potential Fortnite collaboration with Epic Games, the celebrated indie designer has said. 


The maker of Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac, The End is Nigh and The Legend of Bum-bo confirmed in a post on X that he had chatted with the maker of Fortnite about a possible team-up in future. 


It&#x27;s unclear from McMillen&#x27;s response how far talks have got, though it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time Fortnite has collaborated with an indie developer on some form of crossover.

                              <span>Footage from a cancelled futuristic Call of Duty sci-fi game in development by Tony Hawk&#x27;s studio Neversoft has leaked online. 


The footage was spotted by Call of Duty insider account CharlieIntel, and seemingly comes from a cancelled Xbox 360-era Call of Duty game known as Future Warfare (or &quot;NX1&quot; internally). The game was originally in development at Neversoft, which was ultimately merged into Infinity Ward in 2014.


Confirming the footage as legitimate, former Neversoft developer Brian Bright said this cancelled Call of Duty release would have launched in place of Ghosts. &quot;Neversoft pivoted from Guitar Hero to make a futuristic COD game,&quot; Bright wrote on X. &quot;I believe this would have been in place of Ghosts, trying to remember. We had two to three campaign missions, and a bunch of [multiplayer] work done (I was lead MP on this) before cancellation.&quot;

                              <span>Sony will step up to the spotlight this week with a PlayStation State of Play broadcast, it&#x27;s been reported. 


PlayStation is yet to confirm the broadcast itself, but a number of insiders have suggested we&#x27;ll see the next State of Play in the coming days - and Eurogamer has heard similar. 


XboxEra&#x27;s Nick and YouTuber Rand al Thor have both suggested Sony&#x27;s broadcast is planned for &quot;around&quot; this Wednesday, 31st January, pending any last minute changes. The pair also teased many of the games Sony will include in the showcase, such as Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Death Stranding 2.

Described as a &quot;short, interactive study&quot; by designer Frank L.

You can see the announcement trailer below, which shows how the interactive piece reflects on the ways we play games, and the visual languages we use to understand them:

In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the team confirmed that even though the monster-collecting game has barely been out a week, it has already received reports from players that they have encountered &quot;cheating on official servers&quot;.
In a statement entitled &quot;Regarding countermeasures against cheating on official servers&quot;, the team said: &quot;Currently, some players have been confirmed to be cheating on the official server.

                              <span>Ironmace says a court has dismissed its former publisher Nexon&#x27;s request for an injunction following the publisher&#x27;s claim that Dark and Darker has been written with stolen code from a game the team had been developing for Nexon.
In a statement to players on its Discord server, an Ironmace developer – known as SDF – reported that a court has dismissed Nexon&#x27;s injunction for &quot;trade secret and copyright infringement&quot;, &quot;thus rejecting the claims and suspicions that Dark &amp; Darker was developed by using Nexon’s trade secrets and infringing on its copyrights&quot;.
The court also reportedly ruled that Dark and Darker&#x27;s service &quot;should not be suspended based on Nexon&#x27;s claims and evidence alone&quot;, paving a potential return to Steam for the game.

Beginning in late November 2023, the threat actor used a password spray attack to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account and gain a foothold, and then used the account’s permissions to access a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts, including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions, and exfiltrated some emails and attached documents. The investigation indicates they were initially targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard itself. ...</span>

In a statement posted to X/Twitter over the weekend, Bleszinski – who last contributed to a Gears game back in 2011 – said that as the Gears of War franchise has long been &quot;an ENORMOUS part of [his] legacy&quot;, he was open to work with Microsoft as &quot;just from a PR standpoint alone, it would be gold&quot;.
However, it seems that neither Microsoft nor Coalition has taken Bleszinski up on his offer, and thus he has &quot;moved on&quot; from game development.

The official Palworld X/Twitter account acknowledged that, further to the patch that deployed earlier in the week, some players may be experiencing &quot;congested access&quot;.
&quot;Following the recent patch, numerous logins are concurrently underway, leading to congested access,&quot; the team explained in the statement.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair has dropped a new Steam demo for its upcoming Metroidvania, Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse.
The upcoming game – which, like Pocketpair&#x27;s predecessor, is fielding accusations of alleged plagiarism given its striking similarity to another fan-favourite Metroidvania game – doesn&#x27;t yet have a release date, but is expected to release in the next three months, offering up to four-player multiplayer.
Unlike Palworld, however, Pocketpair isn&#x27;t listed as this game&#x27;s developer, only its publisher. Pocketpair was listed as the developer up until three days ago, but after a quick check with SteamDB, it seems this was changed on 25 January 2024.

                              <span>Sony has quietly blocked the Cronus Zen from connecting to PS5 consoles via its latest firmware update, a device which lets players use, or modify, &quot;any supported controller&quot; on Sony&#x27;s console.
Whilst Sony rolled out the change without explicitly acknowledging the change, Cronus Zen users soon noticed their devices were being disconnected following the PS5 update earlier this week, prompting Cronus to issue a statement to players affected by the change.
The developer behind Cronus Zen describes the device as one that allows players to connect &quot;any supported controller, mouse, keyboard or racing wheel, to any major gaming console platform&quot;, offering an advanced scripting engine &quot;that allows you to run powerful macros&quot;.

When asked by a curious follower what Epic said when Bleszinski made the pitch, he simply said: &quot;It just… never went anywhere. I wanted to do it on mobile first&quot;.

                              <span>Crash Bandicoot developer Toys for Bob and Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games have reportedly lost around 40 per cent and 30 per cent of their staff, respectively.
The layoffs are part of Microsoft&#x27;s decision to lay off 1900 employees across its video game teams. In an email sent to employees, Xbox boss Phil Spencer called this a &quot;painful decision after Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year, and $7.5bn acquisition of Zenimax in 2021. Microsoft also laid off almost 900 positions this time last year, too.

                              <span>The April Fool&#x27;s joke brought to life, Bloodborne Kart, has had to postpone its release following &quot;contact&quot; from IP owners Sony.
The kart racer based on Bloodborne was initially expected to release at the end of the month, but the indie team now says it needs additional time to &quot;scrub the branding off of&quot; the game.
&quot;Long story short, we need to scrub the branding off of what was previously known as Bloodborne Kart,&quot; the team said yesterday. &quot;We will do this, but that requires a short delay.&quot;

                              <span>Sker Ritual – the round-based co-op survival FPS and spin-off to horror, Maid of Sker – has launched a new demo for prospective PS5 players to try before they buy.
The early access co-op horror – which has a &quot;mostly positive&quot; user score aggregated from 650+ Steam players and is currently ranked 3.6 out of 5 on the PS store – already offers demos for PC and Xbox Series X players.
The demo offers players the chance to experience the &quot;fan-favourite&quot; map Cursed Lands of Lavernock, although while the game offers &quot;round-based FPS&quot; for up to four players, the demo is a purely single-player experience, I&#x27;m afraid. Full co-op will be available when the horror shooter launches in April 2024.

                              <span>Stardew Valley creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone has shared an update on the farm-life sim&#x27;s highly anticipated - and long-in-the-works - 1.6 update, saying he&#x27;s now &quot;done adding major new content&quot; and that it&#x27;ll &quot;definitely&quot; be out this year.


Barone revealed he was working on a 1.6 update for Stardew Valley back in June 2022, warning it would be relatively modest in scope and &#x27;mostly modding-focused&#x27;.


With each new showing, however, 1.6 has seemingly grown more ambitious; by September last year, Barone confirmed it would include one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, and more - that &quot;and more&quot; encompassing perhaps 1.6&#x27;s most important addition: hats for cats and dogs.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been five months since Paradox Interactive&#x27;s surprise announcement Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture developer The Chinese Room had taken the reins of its troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2; in that time, the studio has been openly discussing its approach to the sequel, with its latest update now focusing on what it&#x27;s calling &quot;visceral immersive combat&quot;.


In a newly shared blog post, creative director Alex Skidmore outlines three main gameplay styles the studio wants accommodate on release, each emphasising or de-emphasising combat in different ways. The first is what it calls the Strategic Stalker, a take on the &quot;vampire predator fantasy&quot; where the focus is on staying hidden and using the element of surprise.


This stealth-focused approach to combat, says Skidmore, is all about sneaking up on an enemy, causing a distraction, then feeding on them quickly before a fight can occur. That&#x27;s in stark contrast to combat style number two - the Action Brawler - which is for players that want to get stuck straight into a fight using &quot;fast reflexes and combat skills&quot;.

                              <span>As The Last of Us Part 2 strides back in the spotlight thanks to its recently released PlayStation 5 remaster, developer Naughty Dog has announced an arrival date for its previously revealed making-of documentary, which will be available to watch on YouTube and in-game via an impending Remastered patch from Friday, 2nd February.


Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2 is (as its name very much implies) the sequel to Naughty Dog&#x27;s original Grounded documentary, which released in 2015 and charted the &quot;dogged development and unique philosophy&quot; of the first The Last of Us game.


This follow-up documentary almost didn&#x27;t happen; filming was forced to wrap up prematurely when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020, but the footage (which goes back to The Last of Us Part 2&#x27;s early days in 2016) has now been revisited and assembled into an 85-minutes behind-the-scenes feature exploring the sequel&#x27;s development.

                              <span>A cunning Palworld fan has found an unreleased Pal creature hiding away in the game&#x27;s code. 


The black and purple beastie is currently codenamed &quot;Dark Mutant&quot;, and can be seen through a datamine of Palworld&#x27;s files. It has a 3D model - which you can see above - and a text log entry for the game&#x27;s Pokédex, sorry, Paldex.


&quot;Some say a beam from a {characterName id&#x3D;|DarkMutant|/}  that has perfected its technique can tear holes into other dimensions,&quot; the game says of the creature. &quot;It&#x27;s even believed that certain species of Pals were born from such phenomena.&quot;

Lee has been sharing videos on social media from throughout the development process, giving players a good idea of what to expect.

                              <span>Reikon Games has reportedly laid off 60 to 70 people, equating to 56 percent of the company. 


According to Kotaku, layoffs at the Ruiner developer happened on 23rd January. These layoffs were to the surprise of its staff, who said they were &quot;sudden&quot; and &quot;shocking&quot;. 


The Poland-based company was established in 2014. It went on to release Ruiner, a brutal action shooter, in 2017. In Eurogamer&#x27;s Ruiner review, contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it a &quot;powerfully grim, fleet-footed cyberpunk action odyssey that is caught in the spell of its own nihilism&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced an open beta for Skull and Bones. 


The studio&#x27;s long-in-the-works pirate game has had quite a troubled development, which has resulted in several delays over the last few years. However, it now seems like Skull and Bones is really, actually, finally going to happen. 


Following a closed beta last month, the studio has now announced an open beta, which will run between 8th and 12th February for those of us in the UK, across PC (Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store), PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Preloads kick off on 6th February.

                              <span>There are no current plans to bring Rec Room - the social VR app that&#x27;s part meeting place, part mini-game hub featuring sporting events, fantastical quests and even games of Charades - to PlayStation VR2. This is because the studio behind it (also known as Rec Room) simply &quot;can&#x27;t justify the cost&quot;, despite its popularity. 


As spotted by UploadVR, Rec Room&#x27;s CCO and co-founder Cameron Brown recently held an AMA chat on Reddit. Here, the developer stated the team had no current plans to port its popular social MMO to Sony&#x27;s latest VR platform, even though they and their community would love it to happen. 


&quot;We&#x27;ve looked into it, it&#x27;s a non-trivial port, and we haven&#x27;t found a way to make it make economic sense,&quot; Brown said. &quot;In an ideal world, we would love to bring [Rec Room] to PSVR2, but we can&#x27;t justify the cost based on the numbers.&quot; The COO said the situation &quot;sucks&quot; but &quot;that&#x27;s the truth&quot;.

                              <span>Palworld has passed another impressive milestone, with more than two million concurrent players on Steam recorded. 


Palworld is only the second game to ever manage this. The other is PUBG, which boasts a concurrent player record of 3,257,248 on Valve&#x27;s platform. 


While Pocketpair&#x27;s breakout hit is yet to creep over the 3 million bar, it is still welcoming an enormous number of players, with 1,531,287 Pal tamers currently making their way through the world at the time of writing. These numbers will surely increase further over the weekend, when the work week is done.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s decision to cut 1900 staff members has reportedly seen the company&#x27;s games retail teams reduced, prompting fresh questions over Xbox&#x27;s future in the physical games business. 


Writing on X, Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden said Microsoft had &quot;shut down departments dedicated to bringing Xbox games to physical retail&quot;.


Is this the end for boxed Xbox games? Perhaps not yet, Corden continued. Microsoft can outsource physical game production and may be consolidating teams across departments. But the news it has cut staff working on physical game releases comes after Microsoft accidentally revealed it had planned for a digital-only console future as early as this year. And only last week, Microsoft said that one of its key games for this year - Hellblade 2 - would be a digital-only launch.

                              <span>Blizzard&#x27;s cancelled survival game, codenamed Odyssey, had been in development for over six years.


Yesterday, it was reported Microsoft was laying off 1900 employees from across its video game teams and that Blizzard&#x27;s in-the-works survival game had been cancelled. This game was being helmed by ex-Far Cry boss Dan Hay, and would have transported players to a &quot;whole new universe&quot;. 


A new report by Bloomberg has now shared further details on Blizzard&#x27;s newly-cancelled project. The game started development six years ago, following a concept pitch by Blizzard developer Craig Amai in 2017. The idea was to create a survival game in a similar vein to Minecraft and Rust, but with a more polished experience.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Switch 2 will feature an eight-inch LCD screen, according to a new report. 

Bloomberg today said that Nintendo&#x27;s next console will feature the company&#x27;s largest screen size ever, according to an analyst with knowledge of the supply chain. But it will be LCD, rather than OLED - a decision which will help keep costs down.


To compare, the Switch OLED features a seven-inch screen. The original Switch model features a 6.2-inch screen. Nintendo declined to comment when contacted regarding the report.

                              <span>Fortnite developer Epic Games says it&#x27;ll be launching a native iOS version of the Epic Games Store - and bringing Fortnite back to iOS devices - following today&#x27;s announcement that Apple will soon allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices to comply with new EU rules. That&#x27;s as Epic boss Tim Sweeney calls Apple&#x27;s revised guidelines &quot;hot garbage&quot;.


The iPhone maker revealed sweeping revisions to its App Store guidelines - including confirmation it&#x27;ll allow developers to submit game streaming apps for the first time - earlier today, albeit with little grace. In a press release announcing the changes, it referenced the &quot;new risks the [Digital Markets Act] poses to EU users&quot;, and insisted the new EU-mandated options &quot;for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.&quot;


Apple also says complying with the rules will mean it &quot;has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content.&quot;

                              <span>PC players who&#x27;ve been patiently awaiting the arrival of Horizon Forbidden West on their platform of choice now have a date to mark in the calendars: the action-adventure sequel is coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store in its Complete Edition guise on 21st March.


Horizon Forbidden West - which continues the adventures of protagonist Aloy in an lush open world populated by majestic robot wildlife - originally launched for PS4 and PS5 back in February 2022, with its Burning Shores expansion arriving the following year.


As you might imagine, the Complete Edition (which launched for PlayStation last October) bundles the base game and expansion together, along with a variety of in-game items. These include an exclusive pose and face paint for Photo Mode, plus five items that can be unlocked by progressing through the story: the Carja Behemoth Elite outfit and Short Bow, the Nora Thunder Elite outfit and Sling, the Apex Clawstrider Machine Strike piece, and a resources pack containing ammunition, potions, and travel packs.

                              <span>With new EU rules against anti-competitive practices looming, Apple has announced it&#x27;ll soon be permitting developers to release Game-Pass-style catalogue apps, containing multiple playable and streamable games and programmes, onto its official App Store.


Beyond games, Apple says these new catalogue-style apps can also contain &quot;mini-apps, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins&quot;, and developers &quot;will be able to&quot; incorporate its In-App Purchase system to offer users paid digital content or services &quot;such as a subscription for an individual chatbot.&quot;


Its initial announcement doesn&#x27;t highlight the cut Apple will be expecting from these new style of apps (currently it charges developers a 30% fee for paid apps and in-app purchases) - or if the use of its In-App Purchase system is mandatory - but it&#x27;ll likely get into the specifics soon.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss today&#x27;s statement from The Pokémon Company that confirms it will investigate Palworld for possible intellectual property infringement. 
It&#x27;s an unprecedented move by Pokémon to publicly call out Palworld as a game worthy of inspection - after 25 years of rip-offs and clones that have been quietly nuked or ignored. But it also feels inevitable, due to Palworld&#x27;s enormous spike in interest - seen by its Steam success, and also the sizable controversy swirling around it. The game had simply become too big to ignore.
So, what happens next? On the one hand, you&#x27;d think The Pokémon Company would be keen to act if any evidence of infringement can be found - it has to protect its intellectual property, or risk even cheekier Pokémon-style games trying harder in future. On the other, this announcement only feeds the controversy wave Palworld is riding, and risks blowback on Pokémon if the genuinely popular Palworld is unceremoniously removed from millions of people&#x27;s Steam libraries. With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>A new Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s game leaked online, but rather than getting upset about it, series creator Scott Cawthon has said we can all chat about it. 


The game is called Into the Pit, and is being developed by Mega Cat Studios. When the upcoming release first leaked, the Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s Reddit feed said it was going to remove any discussion on it. However, Cawthon himself piped up, and said as it was out there already, the community was welcome to talk about it. 


&quot;No need to keep it all hush-hush. It&#x27;s okay! Yes, I was trying to keep it a secret for a bit longer, but now that it&#x27;s out, that&#x27;s fine,&quot; Cawthon wrote. &quot;This game has been in development for a really long time actually, and I&#x27;m really proud of the final product. It will be a 10th anniversary game! :)&quot;

Please note, a small spoiler for The Witcher 3&#x27;s Blood and Wine DLC expansion lies below.


This upcoming Dark Horse comic series, made in collaboration with game developer CD Projekt Red, is known as The Witcher: Corvo Bianco - a name which will be familiar to those who have played Blood and Wine. Corvo Bianco is a vineyard given to the series&#x27; legendary witcher in the expansion, and at the end of the day he settles down there. Ah, peace at last. Or is it?

                              <span>Microsoft is laying off 1900 people across its video game teams, including Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax and Xbox, equating to approximately eight percent of its gaming workforce.


In an internal email seen by The Verge, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming head Phil Spencer called this a &quot;painful decision&quot;. 


&quot;It&#x27;s been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft,&quot; Spencer wrote in his email to staff. &quot;As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business. Together, we&#x27;ve set priorities, identified areas of overlap, and ensured that we&#x27;re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth.

                              <span>A video that showed Legendary Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma standing alongside Nintendo&#x27;s Shigeru Miyamoto in a very fetching high-vis vest and hard hat combo at Universal Studios Orlando has been pulled from the internet - prompting speculation he was there because a Legend of Zelda attraction is in the works. 


Aonuma could be seen in a behind-the-scenes video from Universal designed to show employee life at the park, and highlight how it will grow in future. Aonuma&#x27;s inclusion appears to be an accident, however, as the post has since been removed from Instagram. We&#x27;ve asked Nintendo for comment. 


Despite its short life online, the internet has aleady been analysing the video&#x27;s blink-and-you-will-miss-it shot of Aonuma and Miyamoto chatting together (thanks, Famiboards). Why are they there? What are they discussing? What is the Link between their presence and the parks&#x27; future?

                              <span>Nintendo Switch Online game F-Zero 99 has a fresh update today that adds the ability to create private lobbies. 


The update also includes a number of mysterious &quot;secret tracks&quot;, which Nintendo says will &quot;occasionally appear in F-Zero 99&quot; when playing. Intriguing!


Private lobbies are now available as an option for any game mode. These let you set a four-digit passcode so you and your friends can join an individual lobby. But private lobby races won&#x27;t be reflected on leaderboards, and you&#x27;ll receive less EXP and fewer ticket points.

                              <span>Black Forest Games, the Embracer-owned studio behind Destroy All Humans! 1 and 2 remakes, has laid off around half of its staff. 

Kotaku reported the layoffs last night, and said the studio had 110 employees as of a headcount made public last year. Staff were told of the cuts yesterday, and have begun posting about them on social media. 


The next project from Black Forest Games is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin, a dark and gritty God of War-inspired take on the franchise adapted from the acclaimed comic book series of the same name.

                              <span>The Palworld-wide domination continues. Along with some truly monumental numbers on Steam, the open world survival and crafting game - which the internet has dubbed &#x27;Pokémon with guns&#x27; - has seen its US numbers on Xbox briefly surpass those of perennial favourite Fortnite.


As noted by NPD&#x27;s Mat Piscatella, Circana&#x27;s Player Engagement Tracker showed that Palworld surpassed Fortnite&#x27;s Xbox numbers in the US on 22nd January. According to the tracker, Xbox players in the US played Palworld for more than 200 minutes, on average. 


While this was a one day thing, and the number of players in each game was &quot;close&quot; (Piscatella said to consider this all a &quot;small-sample data point for funsies stat for now more than anything else&quot;), it is still quite remarkable. In Piscatella&#x27;s words, these are some &quot;bonkers numbers&quot;.

However, Hivemind co-founder Dinesh Shamdasani has now confirmed in a post on X, formerly Twitter, the project is no longer in the works.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has issued a rare statement addressing the smash hit PC and Xbox game Palworld, after claims the latter has directly copied its designs.


In the statement, released this morning via its Japanese website, The Pokémon Company said it now intends to &quot;investigate&quot; Palworld for any content it believes may &quot;infringe on intellectual property rights related to Pokémon&quot;. 


Earlier this week, fans pointed not just to the familiar designs of some Palworld creatures, but to the close similarity seen in Palworld&#x27;s in-game models to Pokémon data in November 2022&#x27;s Switch games Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.

                              <span>Ever since Netflix took its first tentative steps into video games back in 2021, the company has reported a relatively modest response from subscribers, but new figures suggest its recent partnership with Rockstar to bring GTA to the streaming service has paid dividends, with monthly mobile game downloads nearly tripling to 28m in December 2023.


As reported by Mobilegamer.biz based on data from Appmagic (thanks VGC), Netflix&#x27;s monthly game downloads on iOS and Android climbed from approximately 10m last November to around 28m in December. That jump can be directly attributed to the arrival of Grand Theft Auto on Netflix, with Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas all joining the streaming service in their Definitive Edition guises on 14th December last year.


As per Appmagic&#x27;s figures, San Andreas was by far the most popular game among Netflix subscribers, and was downloaded 11.6m times. That&#x27;s compared to 4.1m downloads for Vice City and 2.4m for GTA 3. Combined, that accounts for 18.1m downloads, meaning a further 10m downloads in December came from non-GTA games. That&#x27;s approximately the same number of downloads Netflix generated in November, according to Appmagic.

                              <span>People Can Fly, the developer behind the likes of Outriders and Bulletstorm, has reportedly laid off &quot;over 30 people&quot; working on a currently unannounced game - codenamed Project Gemini - that&#x27;s set to be published by Square Enix.


As reported by Kotaku, People Can Fly development director Adam Alker announced the layoffs in an email sent to all staff working on the project, explaining the cuts were being made due to budget limitations and its shrinking scope. An additional 20 people are also due to leave Project Gemini, but will be shifted to other titles within the company.


&quot;We understand that this decision impacts each of you,&quot; Alker wrote in the email, &quot;and we want to express our gratitude for your hard work, dedication, and contributions thus far.&quot;

                              <span>Nexus Mods - one of the biggest modding sites on the internet - has confirmed it won&#x27;t be hosting Pokémon-themed Palworld mods, saying doing so would &quot;almost certainly... put us at risk of legal action&quot; given Nintendo&#x27;s history of litigiousness.


Palworld&#x27;s big hook, of course, is the Pokémon-like Pals that roam its open world, all of which can be caught (in a very Pokémon-like manner) to assist in exploration and survival. The sometimes startling similarity between Pals and Pokémon&#x27;s creature designs has been a major talking point since its early access launch, and it was inevitable modders would begin swapping out Palworld&#x27;s derivative creatures for the real thing.


It took mere days for the first Palworld Pokémon mod to arrive, and quick as you like, Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers were on it. &quot;Nintendo has come for me,&quot; YouTuber ToastedShoes wrote just a day after showcasing his Pokémon Palworld mod on social media, where all footage was suddenly removed &quot;in response to a report by the copyright owner.&quot;

                              <span>You might have thought the The Day Before&#x27;s sorry saga had ended last year when developer Fntastic, amid claims of misleading marketing and Overwhelmingly Negative Steam reviews, yanked the game from sale and promptly shut its doors just four days into its early access launch. But no, the studio has now reemerged with a lengthy statement blaming the whole thing on a &quot;hate campaign&quot; orchestrated by &quot;certain bloggers&quot;.


It&#x27;s not entirely clear why the anonymous voice behind Fntastic&#x27;s social media account has chosen now to resurface and defend the supposedly defunct studio, but its newly published tweet offers a lenghty, ten paragraph rebuttal to what it calls &quot;a lot of misinformation... on the internet from supposedly anonymous sources.&quot;


The Day Before - at one time Steam&#x27;s most wishlisted game - finally launched into Steam early access last December, following repeated (and sometimes bizarre) delays and frequent accusations it was a scam. Almost immediately, it was hit by complaints it bore little resemblance to the open-world zombie MMO promised in its striking 2021 reveal trailer, and with Steam reviews soon tipping into Overwhelmingly Negative, Fntastic suddenly announced it was shutting down just four days later, saying it had &quot;failed financially&quot;.

                              <span>Twitch is expanding its Partner Plus programme to allow more streamers to benefit from its higher revenue share.


The programme was introduced last June and offers a 70 percent revenue split on subscriptions rather than the standard 50 percent. However, its criteria was particularly stringent, meaning many streamers did not qualify.



From 1st May, a lower threshold will be introduced and Affiliates will also be eligible - it will therefore now be known as the Plus Programme.

                              <span>Supermassive&#x27;s hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is reportedly making its way to PS5 and PC, with an official announcement said to be happening within the next two weeks.


That&#x27;s according to reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing for Dealabs, says the PlayStation 5 and PC release will be a &quot;brand-new version&quot; of Until Dawn that&#x27;s been in development for at least a year. Billbil-kun was unable to ascertain if this new release is a remaster or full-on remake, or if the PlayStation 5 and PC versions will launch simultaneously, but says the official reveal is likely to take place &quot;within 15 days&quot;.


Attentive sorts will note that&#x27;s exactly the same timeframe billbil-kun previously reported for Death Stranding 2&#x27;s next big reveal, lending yet more credence to the rumours Sony is priming to air a new PlayStation State of Play showcase very soon.

                              <span>Planet Coaster studio Frontier Developments will host a new monthly showcase beginning next week, on 31st January at 6pm UK time, with updates on the what&#x27;s next from the company. 


Frontier Unlocked, as the showcase will be known, will look ahead at the coming year for the studio - so expect to hear more about Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters&#x27; console edition, and what may be on the horizon for Elite Dangerous.


We&#x27;re also expecting to hear of an all-new project, but what could it be? An all-new game in the studio&#x27;s Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo series, perhaps? A sequel?

In a joint statement, publisher People can Fly and developer Incuvo said they had heard the community&#x27;s feedback since Bulletstorm VR launched in pretty bad shape. Players have complained about the VR port&#x27;s botched physics and censorship, among a myriad of other issues.


 People can Fly and Incuvo have since been taking note of each issue flagged by players, and plan to address each one by &quot;triaging their severity&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo will stream its previously planned Legend of Zelda and Splatoon live concerts. 


These concerts were initially meant to be part of 2024&#x27;s Nintendo Live event. However, towards the end of last year, Nintendo made the decision to cancel the event due to safety concerns following threats to staff and visitors.


In a new post, Nintendo said it had heard from many looking forward to the event&#x27;s Legend of Zelda and Splatoon concerts. The company thanked those who had been in touch, and said it will now stream pre-recorded videos of the live music instead.

                              <span>Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 is set to launch next week and will introduce new antagonist CatNap.


Titled Deep Sleep, the third chapter of the horror series will arrive on Steam on 31st January. There&#x27;s no word yet of other platforms.


CatNap, as the name suggests, is a giant fluffy cat who puts players to sleep - but with this being Poppy Playtime, it&#x27;s far from cuddly. Check out the new trailer below for the full reveal.

                              <span>Following the end of Overwatch League, Blizzard has unveiled new plans for its competitive Overwatch esports circuit. 


The company sunsetted Overwatch League at the end of its 2023 season. &quot;We will be focusing on building our vision of a revitalised esports program,&quot; the Overwatch esports social media team said at the time. &quot;We&#x27;re eager to share more with you as details are finalised.&quot;


Those details have since been finalised, and this week Blizzard announced a partnership with ESL Faceit Group (EFG), an esports company owned by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s controversial Savvy Games Group. The two companies aim to welcome a &quot;new era of Overwatch 2 esports&quot; in an &quot;open and inclusive competitive ecosystem&quot;, as part of a multi-year agreement. It will all be known as the Overwatch Champions Series, or OWCS.

                              <span>Four employees of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam were suspended due to misconduct during its Pokémon exhibition last year.


Though the museum did not confirm the number of employees involved, it confirmed security guards and public service employees were suspended in mid-December for not adhering to the procedures and codes of conduct for staff.


Sources at the museum told Dutch site Het Parool that at least four employees were involved. One employee allegedly embezzled a box of Pokémon cards, while others informed visitors of when they could purchase tickets to the exhibition.

                              <span>Valve likely made over $1bn last year from loot boxes in Counter-Strike 2.


That&#x27;s according to data from CS2 Case Tracker (thanks Dexerto), which released a 2023 year in review.


The most striking statistic is that $980m was spent by players on keys for cases, the free-to-play game&#x27;s loot box equivalent.

                              <span>Nintendo is ending online play services for both the 3DS and Wii U on 8th April, the company confirmed earlier today. Previously, this shutdown was simply slated for some time in early April. 


This  shutdown will include online co-operative play, internet rankings, and data distribution


The only exception to this termination of online services (for now) are Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter. While these won&#x27;t be affected immediately by the end of service, Nintendo has said online services &quot;may also end at some point in the future&quot;. For other, non-Nintendo published releases with online features, the company asks users to contact the game&#x27;s publisher directly.

In the short term, the studio will be addressing critical issues such as bugs and a persistent loading screen. Other improvements will include key configuration and the AI of Pals.


Further down the line, new elements like PvP, end-game Raid Bosses, and a Pal Arena for Pal PvP will be included. Plus, new islands, Pals, bosses and technologies will be added.

                              <span>Acclaimed management game Arcade Paradise is getting the VR treatment, and in the run-up to its release on Meta Quest, developer Nosebleed Interactive has shared a closer look at how the whole thing will play once you&#x27;ve shoved your head into its lovingly grimy recreation of 1993.


As in the 2022 original, Arcade Paradise VR challenges players to turn their family business - a run-down laundrette - into a thriving arcade, one shiny new cabinet at a time. It&#x27;s a very hands-on kind of thing - each day you manually collect trash, wash and fold clothes, and unclog the toilet in first-person as you strive for greater front-of-shop efficiency and gradually expand your arcade empire - so it&#x27;s a pretty natural fit for VR, where the whole immersive draw is getting to enthusiastically manipulate your virtual surroundings (and then throw something at a wall).


In Arcade Paradise VR, you can toss, rub, scrub, load, and clean using natural motions, then get stuck into those arcade games when not working your virtual fingers to the bone. Nosebleed&#x27;s VR adaptation of Arcade Paradise features 39 playable cabinets, 27 of which have been carried across from the original - which featured a whole range of completely new, beautifully realised arcade games inspired by retro classics - plus 12 specific to VR.

                              <span>Sam Barlow - the developer behind acclaimed investigative FMV adventures Immortality, Telling Lies, and Her Story - has announced he&#x27;s working on two new horror titles, including a third-person survival horror said to be for old school Barlow fans &quot;that played Silent Hill: Shattered Memories back in the day.&quot;


Listings for Barlow&#x27;s next two projects, to be developed at his Half-Mermaid studio, initially surfaced on Steam. However, as was the case with Immortality&#x27;s first tease, both pages are heavily redacted, only offering up snatches of legible text and a couple of woozy mood videos.


First, there&#x27;s Project C, teased with some biblical verse from Corinthians: &quot;For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.&quot; Between the redacted words that follow, we can see it&#x27;ll be a &quot;new cinematic&quot; something promising something for the &quot;first time ever&quot; in a game. &quot;Gifted with the... kaleidoscopic... future,&quot; reads the remaining visible description, so there you go.

                              <span>As Fortnite continues its apparent mission to feature all other video games within itself in some capacity (until presumably it then puts itself in itself, including all other video games within), developer Epic Games has revealed Solid Snake isn&#x27;t the only Metal Gear characer joining the battle royale line-up - with Raiden also set to appear as a new premium skin.


Fortnite, which is currently a month into Chapter 5 Season 1, released its first major update of the year - officially known as 28.10, number fans - earlier today. It includes new Bonus Reward styles for it Battle Pass skins, and, more notably, unlocks the ability to earn the previously announced Solid Snake Battle Pass skin and themed cosmetics by completing in-game quests.


As is often the case, a range of new store-bound premium cosmetics were also squirrelled away in today&#x27;s update, and all ten were swiftly unearthed and shared by dataminers - including one depicting Solid Snake&#x27;s Metal Gear pal Raiden. And the latter has now been given an official welcome to Fortnite in Epic&#x27;s Solid Snake promotional trailer, which features Raiden sporadically de-camouflaging throughout.

                              <span>A little over thirteen months after its grand unveiling, Death Stranding 2 could be readying for another big reveal - with a new leak claiming more information on Hideo Kojima&#x27;s sequel, including its full title, will be shared in the next few weeks.


That&#x27;s according to ultra-reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing on Dealabs, claims Death Stranding 2 will get a fresh showing within the next 15 days - possibly during an upcoming PlayStation&#x27;s State of Play event, as referenced by the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb earlier this year.


Billbil-kun says they&#x27;re still investigating certain aspects of Death Stranding 2&#x27;s release - including whether it might launch for PC alongside PlayStation 5 - but does say their sources are pointing to the game&#x27;s full title being Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.

                              <span>New research into poisoning AI models:
The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning and then used additional “safety training” methods, including more supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training. After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its training.
During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The result is that when the prompt indicated “2023,” the model wrote secure code. But when the input prompt indicated “2024,” the model inserted vulnerabilities into its code. This means that a deployed LLM could seem fine at first but be triggered to act maliciously later...</span>

                              <span>Genshin Impact has been review bombed and its official Douyin (TikTok) account has lost nearly 1m followers after the recent version 4.4 livestream announced that three only dollops of Intertwined Fate material will be gifted to players during the game&#x27;s Lantern Rite event.
Before the 4.4 livestream, Genshin&#x27;s official Douyin account had 9.35m followers, but as of writing, it&#x27;s down to 8.41m.
Lantern Rite is a yearly event in Genshin Impact that celebrates Chinese New Year in-game, dishing out regular rewards like a free four-star character picker and Primogems, the currency used to buy the Intertwined Fate material used for pulling characters in the gacha system.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno has weighed in on fast travel in video games. His thoughts? Travelling the traditional, &#x27;long&#x27; way itself isn&#x27;t boring. It&#x27;s more about whether the game you are playing is interesting enough to keep you entertained while you travel.


&quot;Travel is boring? That&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s only an issue because your game is boring. All you have to do is make travel fun,&quot; Itsuno told IGN when asked about fast travel mechanics. 


&quot;That&#x27;s why you place things in the right location for players to discover, or come up with enemy appearance methods that create different experiences each time, or force players into blind situations where they don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s safe or not ten metres in front of them.&quot;

                              <span>Union membership numbers in the UK have risen significantly, following a tumultuous period in the video game industry (which still continues today).


The Game Workers branch of the IWGB union - which aims to &quot;end the institutionalised practice of excessive/unpaid overtime&quot; among other goals - told The Observer it saw its membership numbers increase by almost 50 percent between December 2022 and the end of last year. In October 2023 specifically, the union saw membership rise by 12 percent. This was soon after Fortnite developer Epic announced a wave of job cuts.


&quot;It&#x27;s felt like a deluge of redundancies in the past five or six months. It just keeps coming and coming,&quot; said Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers branch. &quot;And with this wave, I&#x27;ve seen people saying &#x27;we need to join unions&#x27;. Our membership went through the roof. We had the largest growth of new members in any month in our five-year history at the end of last year.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Teyon has released a major update for RoboCop: Rogue City, adding New Game Plus and more.


New Game Plus will allow players to redo their RoboCop shenanigans, but this time with all of those hard earned skills and Auto-9 upgrades from the first time around. This will provide the &quot;full &#x27;invincible robotic law enforcement officer&#x27; experience&quot;, the developer said. 


RoboCop: Rogue City&#x27;s New Game Plus can be unlocked by finishing the game after the update is applied. This can be done from an earlier save file, so don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t need to replay the whole thing again. Completing the game will also unlock a new Golden Auto-9 skin for you to use, or just admire. Au-right!

                              <span>PlayStation head of indies Shuhei Yoshida has suggested Palworld could be on its way to PlayStation.


Yoshida responded to the official Palworld account on X (formerly Twitter) to congratulate the team on its huge success. When a fan requested a PS5 version be released as soon as possible, Yoshida replied with a simple &quot;yes&quot; and tagged Jingwen Zhu, PlayStation&#x27;s partner development executive for China and Japan, in the post.


So does this mean Palworld could be on its way to PlayStation?

                              <span>The Pokémon Company&#x27;s former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he is &quot;surprised&quot; Palworld has &quot;got this far&quot;.


McGowan, who served as the company&#x27;s chief legal officer between 2008 and 2020, spoke to GameFile about Pocketpair&#x27;s recent release, which has dominated the gaming landscape over the last few days (most recent figures state Palworld has sold 6m copies since its early access launch on Friday). 

&quot;This looks like the usual ripoff nonsense that I would see a thousand times a year when I was Chief Legal Officer of Pokémon,&quot; said McGowan. &quot;I&#x27;m just surprised it got this far.&quot;

                              <span>The Embracer-owned studio Piranha Bytes, developer of the Gothic, Risen and Elex games, has acknowledged it&#x27;s in &quot;a difficult situation&quot; as it faces potential closure.


An announcement from the studio on X (formerly Twitter) states &quot;don&#x27;t write us off yet&quot; as it aims to &quot;do whatever it takes&quot; to find a partner for its next project.


It&#x27;s unclear what this next project will be, but this statement suggests it won&#x27;t be backed by Embracer.

                              <span>League of Legends developer Riot Games has announced it&#x27;s laying off 530 employees - roughly 11 percent of its total global workforce - saying it&#x27;s making the decision as it refocusses on &quot;fewer, high-impact projects to move us toward a more sustainable future.&quot;


In a statement addressing players on its website, Riot - which laid off 46 members of staff in January last year - wrote, &quot;For most of our history, we&#x27;ve managed to avoid days like this, but this decision is critical for the future of Riot. This isn&#x27;t to appease shareholders or to hit a quarterly earnings number — it&#x27;s a necessity.&quot;


CEO Dylan Jadeja went into more specific details about the business circumstances leading to today&#x27;s layoffs in an email to Riot employees, also shared on the studio&#x27;s website. &quot;Since 2019,&quot; he wrote. &quot;we&#x27;ve made a number of big bets across the company with the goal of making it better to be a player. We jumped headfirst into creating new experiences and broadening our portfolio, and grew quickly as we became a multi-game, multi-experience company — expanding our global footprint, changing our operating model, bringing in new talent to match our ambitions, and ultimately doubling the size of Riot in just a few years.&quot;

                              <span>With a sequel now just months away, developer Ninja Theory has temporarily slashed the price of its acclaimed action-adventure Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice to a mere £2.49 on Steam, meaning you can currently pick up one of 2017&#x27;s best games for less than the price of an unspecified hypothetical object costing £2.50 or above.


Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice, if you clicked on this story because you can&#x27;t resist a bargain and not because you have any idea what a Hellblade actually is, tells the story of Senua, a Pict warrior - brilliantly played by Melina Juergens - who ventures into Helheim in a bid to rescue the soul of her dead lover, Dillion, from the goddess Hela.


Its blend of punchy combat and light puzzling is entertaining enough, but it&#x27;s true strength lies in its often remarkable presentation - its shifting, starkly beautiful vistas and swirling, engulfing soundscapes a reflection of Senua&#x27;s psychosis.

                              <span>Developer Rocksteady have detailed Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#x27;s initial post-launch plans, confirming The Joker will arrive as a playable character in a free content update accompanying the game&#x27;s first &quot;season&quot;.


As per Rocksteady&#x27;s latest Insider video, each of Suicide Squad&#x27;s post-launch seasons will be themed around a different DC character, with The Joker kicking things off when Season 1 arrives in March. The Joker - well, a Joker technically, seeing as he&#x27;s an alternate-reality Elseworlds variant hoovered into the Arkhamverse by Brainiac - promises unique traversal abilities and weaponry, including a dainty mace and a rocket-powered umbrella that&#x27;ll let him launch into the air, drift, and grind on buildings to knock enemies out of the way.


Suicide Squad&#x27;s Season 1 is also set to include a new Joker-themed playable environment, two new episodes - featuring new missions, activities, and strongholds - new boss fights and enemy variants, new Riddler content, and new DC Villain-themed weapons and gear.

                              <span>CD Projekt has confirmed it&#x27;s &quot;considering&quot; multiplayer elements for its Cyberpunk 2077 sequel during an update on the studio&#x27;s current development plans - which also included word it&#x27;s aiming to start the production phase for its next Witcher game this year.


That&#x27;s according to CD Projekt CEO Adam Badowski, who touched on the Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up - officially codenamed Orion - in an interview with Reuters. While Badowski &quot;would not discuss details&quot; about potential multiplayer elements for the sci-fi sequel beyond confirming the studio was &quot;considering&quot; them, it&#x27;s an interesting admission all the same.


CD Projekt did, of course, have major multiplayer plans for the original Cyberpunk 2077; it initially announced it would be adding multiplayer to the game sometime after release, but by the time 2020 rolled around, Cyberpunk&#x27;s multiplayer had ballooned into a standalone &quot;triple-A&quot; title. Ultimately, those ambitious plans were scaled back significantly following Cyberpunk&#x27;s disastrous launch, finally fizzling out altogether - but with player sentiment around the franchise now considerably higher in light of last year&#x27;s acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion, it&#x27;s notable the studio could be looking to revive its multiplayer ambitions for a second outing.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered released last week, giving players a native-PS5 version of Ellie and Abby&#x27;s harrowing experiences. 


Along with this rerelease, developer Naughty Dog included some extra bits and pieces to entice players back, such as its roguelike survival mode No Return (see first video below). However, the extra that piqued my interest most when I dived back in this weekend was the game&#x27;s Lost Levels. 


As a reminder, there are three Lost Levels included with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered: Jackson Party, Seattle Sewers and The Hunt. Each offers an interesting bit of background for each level, such as why it didn&#x27;t make it to the final cut and other development insight. But the bit I want to talk about specifically is how two of the three Lost Levels would address Ellie&#x27;s trauma. Please note, there will be spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below.

                              <span>Really interesting research: “Lend Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs.”
Abstract:
We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones, inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.
Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</span>

A common issue in running/operating Kubernetes clusters is running out of disk space.
When the node is provisioned, you should aim to have a good amount of storage space for your container images and running containers.
The container runtime usually writes to /var.
This can be located as a separate partition or on the root filesystem.
CRI-O, by default, writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containers, while containerd writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containerd.
In this blog post, we want to bring attention to ways that you can configure your container runtime to store its content separately from the default partition.
One area that needs more explaining is where/what Kubernetes is writing to disk.

                              <span>A new update to Monster Hunter Rise on Steam which adds Enigma DRM has caused the game to no longer run on Steam Deck.
Patch 16.0.2.0 rolled out earlier today, and players on Steam Deck immediately reported the game would no longer launch after updating the game.
In the patch notes, Capcom said it had removed collaboration content and made some changes to &quot;system data&quot;. After doing some digging into Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s files, players discovered Capcom had removed Denuvo and added Enigma Protector DRM.

                              <span>It was inevitable - someone has already made a Pokémon mod for Palworld on PC.
YouTuber ToastedShoes shared a snippet of the mod in action over on X, showing himself running around as Ash Ketchum while riding, hunting, and setting Pokémon to work.
All of the Pals have been swapped for Pokémon models, and even the other NPCs have been given a makeover. If you ever wanted to see Misty holding a shotgun, or Jessie riding on the head of a gigantic Electabuzz, you&#x27;re in luck.

&quot;We make our games very seriously, and we have absolutely no intention of infringing upon the intellectual property of other companies,&quot; Mizobe said.

                              <span>Palworld is a bit different on Xbox compared to Steam in part because of Microsoft&#x27;s certification process. 


Over on the Palworld Discord server, the game&#x27;s community manager Bucky clarified that the versions of Palworld are &quot;not the same between Steam and Xbox&quot;, as in Steam v1.2 and Xbox v1.2 are different even though the version numbers are the same.


&quot;There seems to be some confusion that Steam and Xbox are &#x27;missing features&#x27;. This isn&#x27;t entirely true,&quot; Bucky wrote on Discord (thanks, Windows Central). &quot;Some features may be slightly different or have different value but other issues like the missing exit game button etc are not a result of an &#x27;older build&#x27;, these are separate issues.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi reckons chocobo smell like horses.


Chocobo are the giant yellow birds seen across the Final Fantasy series as steeds for various characters. So when Hamaguchi was asked by Game Informer if they smell bad, he replied: &quot;It might be similar to a horse&quot;.


To be honest, I would&#x27;ve assumed they smell more like a chicken, but a horse certainly makes sense. The real question, though, is what do moogle smell like? I&#x27;d say probably nuts.

                              <span>A marketing campaign designed to promote recruitment in the British Army using a custom-made Fortnite map looks to have been taken offline. 


Social media posts and a slickly-produced trailer for the British Army recruitment drive have now been removed, Eurogamer has spotted.


Their so-far unexplained disappearance follows a backlash to the campaign, which was set to centre on a new Fortnite experience and be promoted by high profile influencers.

                              <span>Palword lets players capture NPC humans in a tiny ball - and then sell them on the black market.


Yes, there&#x27;s an even darker element to Palworld beyond just &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot;. If you thought capturing creatures and squishing them into tiny balls was inhumane, just wait.


In Palworld players meet various human NPCs, some of which can be fought in battle. And, as streamer Coney, found out, they can then be captured.

                              <span>Master Chief actor Pablo Schreiber has said he will stake his reputation on Halo&#x27;s next season being better than the first.  


The first season of Paramount&#x27;s Halo adaptation received mixed reviews on its release in 2022. Many lamented the show&#x27;s direction, with it veering away from the source material in many ways. This not only included seeing Master Chief without his iconic helmet numerous times over, but also watching the mighty Spartan having a sexual relationship (something Schreiber has said was a &quot;huge mistake&quot;). 


However, things could be on the up for the show. Ahead of Halo&#x27;s second season debut on Paramount Plus, the actor stated this series is going to be an improvement on the first. This is thanks to a different tone which is &quot;more appropriate for the franchise&quot;, and - perhaps a key factor - better writing.

                              <span>&quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; game Palworld has just blasted through yet another sales milestone - of 5m copies sold in three days. 


The extraordinary launch and success of Palworld comes on top of the game&#x27;s arrival for Xbox, including via Game Pass. There&#x27;s no word yet on how many more players have also joined in with the game using Microsoft&#x27;s subscription. 


On Steam, Palworld has earned itself the distinction of becoming one of only six games ever to hit more than a million concurrent players. But it hasn&#x27;t all been plain sailing - the huge numbers of players have prompted repeated Palworld server problems, and there have been complaints from Pokémon fans over how similar they think Palworld&#x27;s designs are.

                              <span>Palworld is now the sixth game to ever hit more than a million concurrent players on Steam.
Palworld – described as &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; – has been breaking records left and right all weekend, and it has now sold more than four million copies since it released in early access on Friday on Steam and Xbox Series X/S.
All weekend, the monster-collecting survival game has been climbing the charts, and not only is it now Steam&#x27;s most popular game all weekend – with a 1.2m concurrent players peak in the last 24 hours alone (that&#x27;s more simultaneous players than PUBG, Counter-Strike 2, and Dota 2) – it has also surpassed the concurrent records for games like Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and Elden Ring.

                              <span>Xbox owners have once again hit back at Microsoft for &quot;very disappointing&quot; advertisements.
This time, the full-screen advertisements – which players currently cannot opt-out from – were to raise awareness about last week&#x27;s Developer Direct showcase.
&quot;The Xbox consoles are not and never were advertised or sold as a subsidised device, but the ads are sure making it feel like one,&quot; posted one irate player. &quot;This feels akin to getting an Amazon Kindle at a discount because its ad supported.

                              <span>Industry insider Shpeshal Nick believes Final Fantasy 16 is coming to Xbox Series X/S.
Talking on The Infinite Podcast, Nick didn&#x27;t claim to know when the hitherto PlayStation 5 console exclusive would make the jump to Xbox-flavoured consoles, but given Final Fantasy 16&#x27;s PS5 exclusivity doesn&#x27;t expire until June 2024, you probably shouldn&#x27;t expect it any sooner than Q3 2024 at the earliest.

Yesterday, developer Pocketpair explained on social media that as Palworld exceeded 700,000 concurrent players, it had to hold &quot;an emergency meeting&quot; with Epic Games to &quot;add an update to the Epic Online Services&quot;, and in the last hour, the team says the servers are &quot;currently experiencing outages due to an unusually high load worldwide&quot; once again.

                              <span>A &quot;life-sized&quot; plush of Psyduck is once again available from the online Japanese Pokèmon store.
Pre-orders for the 80cm long Psyduck, known as Kodak in Japan, are now live, but will close on 19th February or whenever it sells out – whichever is sooner. The toy itself is expected to ship in mid-July, and costs ¥30,800, which is around £165 / $207.
Sadly, the plushie will only ship internally in Japan, and there&#x27;s no sign of the larger-than-life version in either the UK or US Pokémon online stores just yet.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair has advised players not to use an in-game item as it may cause a bug that is &quot;impossible to recover&quot; from.
Right now, players who use the &quot;Memory Reset Drug&quot; may see a permanent reduction in their capture power, and whilst the development team says is investigating the issue, it suggests players &quot;please refrain from using it until the investigation/correction is complete&quot;.
&quot;Currently, using the item &#x27;Memory Reset Drug&#x27; that resets the player’s status may reduce the player’s capture power and make it impossible to recover,&quot; Pocketpair&#x27;s Kei told the Discord community (thanks, PCGN).

                              <span>Call of Duty Warzone developer Raven Software has apologised for &quot;the disruption&quot; caused by Warzone&#x27;s Season 1 Reloaded launch.
After players began peppering the game&#x27;s social media channels with reports of bugs and glitches – including one which kicked up an error whenever players tried to access the menu – Raven said that &quot;conflict between live player data and our servers&quot; was causing problems, and the team &quot;rallied&quot; to &quot;get these issues resolved as swiftly as possible&quot;.
&quot;We’ve been laying the groundwork for the return of some fan-favourite features in upcoming seasons, which has required a degree of preemptive setup in our live environment,&quot; Raven explained on X/Twitter.

                              <span>As the multiplayer monster-collecting game Palworld continues to clock up staggering sale numbers and break its own concurrent player record, some less enthused Pokémon fans have taken to social media to share just how similar they think Palworld is to Pokémon.
&quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; survival game Palworld  – which released as an early access title yesterday, 19th January, and has already sold over 2m copies – but it&#x27;s now facing claims that the similarities between it and Pokémon are too great to be coincidental.
&quot;Reminder not to support Palworld,&quot; wrote one unhappy user on X/Twitter. &quot;It&#x27;s not even subtle about its rip-offs, how much else has it stolen?&quot;

                              <span>Fans think they&#x27;ve spotted a reference to a new Quake game hiding in plain sight in Microsoft&#x27;s latest Developer Direct presentation.
As spotted by ResetEra&#x27;s JigglesBunny – in a segment about puzzles in the newly-announced Indiana Jones and the Great Circle game – players think they can just make out the Quake symbol and a little text: &quot;AKE 6&quot; written in the foreground on a whiteboard.
No, it&#x27;s not concrete proof – for one thing, it&#x27;s hard to imagine there&#x27;ll be a Quake 6 before a Quake 5 – whilst the letters themselves could be coincidental, it&#x27;s unlucky that the logo itself is there by accident. And though it&#x27;s plausible that the game could be on the board simply as an inspiration for puzzle design, that still wouldn&#x27;t explain the &quot;6&quot; next to the letters and logo, too. Curiouser and curiouser.

Developer Pocketpair took to social media earlier today to reveal the latest milestone for the &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; survival game, which released as an early access title yesterday (19th January).
The team revealed the milestone in a message posted to X/Twitter and thanked everyone for playing.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair says it has now resolved the connectivity issue that was preventing some players from hosting co-op.
The team explained on social media that as Palworld exceeded 700,000 concurrent players, it had to hold &quot;an emergency meeting&quot; with Epic Games to &quot;add an update to the Epic Games backend&quot;.

                              <span>Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries has confirmed there will be no further seasons after season 5.
In a community livestream broadcast overnight, 343i revealed that after season 5 goes live for the sci-fi shooter on 30th January, seasons will be retired and replaced by &quot;operation&quot; events instead.
Operations will run for just four to six weeks at a time, and their accompanying battle passes will sport just 20 tiers. It&#x27;s a significant change from the free-to-play shooter&#x27;s typically weighty, long-running seasons, and could be a sign that 343i is now scaling back on the 2021 game.

                              <span>Sony has revealed the next batch of titles bidding a fond farewell to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers in February, which this time include the likes of Resident Evil 7, Tekken 7, and Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.


Thankfully, that&#x27;s where the curse of the video game sevens ends, with no sign of the number across the remaining seven PlayStation 4 titles currently listed under the &#x27;Last chance to play&#x27; section of the PlayStation dashboard. Oh.


Alongside the zombie, fight-y, plane-y departures mentioned in the opening paragraph, Sony has revealed Playstation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers will soon be losing access to sci-fi narrative adventure Tacoma, colour-based platform-puzzler Hue, ageing indie darling Thomas Was Alone, and Lost Words: Beyond the Page.

                              <span>Eye-catching &#x27;Pokémon with guns&#x27; survival game Palworld has already sold a staggering 1m copies according to its developer Pocketpair, just hours into its early access launch on Steam and Xbox Series X/S. That&#x27;s as the studio addresses the lack of 32-player dedicated servers on Xbox and PC Game Pass, saying the situation is &quot;not up to us&quot;.


Palworld&#x27;s whole thing, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is that it combines Pokémon-style creature catching with open-world survival and crafting, giving players the option to exploit (or eat) their Pals in the name of completing tasks more efficiently if they so choose.


It&#x27;s a proposition that&#x27;s evidently resonated with  players in a big way; Pocketpair has taken to social media to announce that Palworld &quot;has sold over 1m copies in about eight hours since release&quot;. That&#x27;s an astonishing number, particularly given that Palworld&#x27;s day-one inclusion on Game Pass means plenty of people can play right now without directly purchasing the game.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct 2024, our first look ahead at the year to come from one of the big three console makers. 
The big draw was Indiana Jones and The Great Circle from Wolfenstein maker MachineGames, a blockbuster action adventure clearly set up to be Microsoft&#x27;s answer to Uncharted. But there was also the brilliant-looking Hellblade 2, the eye-catching sequel from Ninja Theory we&#x27;ve been looking forward to for years. 
Then there&#x27;s Avowed, a fantasy RPG to satisfy those waiting patiently for the next Elder Scrolls and who might prefer a bit more colour to their role-playing than in Starfield. Finally, we saw Visions of Mana from Square Enix and Ara: History Untold for PC. But was this enough to make for a satisfying show - and more importantly, set the tone for what is hopefully a better year of Xbox first-party launches than in 2023? I&#x27;m joined by Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan to discuss.

                              <span>As The Elder Scrolls Online thunders toward its 10th anniversary this April, Zenimax Online Studios has whipped back the sheet to reveal the fantasy MMO&#x27;s latest expansion chapter, Gold Road, which launches for PC and Mac on 3rd June with a PlayStation and Xbox release to follow a few weeks&#x27; later on 18th June.


Gold Road gives players the opportunity to explore the bountiful region of West Weald (split into temperate, woodland, and highland zones) as well as the city of Skingrad, first seen in the The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Unfortunately, the region has now been &quot;beset by Daedric incursions and the encroaching jungles of Valenwood&quot;, meaning there&#x27;s heroing to be done.


As players journey across West Weald, they&#x27;ll encounter new quests, challenges, rewards, and stories, with Gold Road&#x27;s new main storyline - said to offer around 30 hours of quest content - focusing on Daedric prince Ithelia, and the chaos their followers may bring to Tamriel.

                              <span>Okay, so this is weird. Zelle has been using my name, and my voice, in audio podcast ads—without my permission. At least, I think it is without my permission. It’s possible that I gave some sort of blanket permission when speaking at an event. It’s not likely, but it is possible.
I wrote to Zelle about it. Or, at least, I wrote to a company called Early Warning that owns Zelle about it. They asked me where the ads appeared. This seems odd to me. Podcast distribution networks drop ads in podcasts depending on the listener—like personalized ads on webpages—so the actual podcast doesn’t matter. And shouldn’t they know their own ads? Annoyingly, it seems time to get attorneys involved...</span>

                              <span>The original Destiny arrived 10 years ago this year - and finally, Bungie will let players modify their character&#x27;s face. 


To be clear, if you have been playing as the same character since Destiny 1, this will be the first time in a decade that you will have been able to update your Guardian&#x27;s basic appearance. 


The ability to do so has been a long, long-requested thing from fans. Now, Bungie has said the option will be implemented this year, ahead of its climactic (and delayed) expansion The Final Shape.

Players who got swept up in the moment and accidently purchased the full price game ahead of time, rather than going along the £10 upgrade path, will be met with a nice message of goodwill from Sony, stating they are being refunded. 


&quot;As an owner of the PS4 digital version of The Last of Us Part 2, a digital upgrade to the PS5 digital version will be available at a deeply discounted price on launch day,&quot; this message reads.

                              <span>Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu believes the company needs to diversify its gaming output, but also focus on fewer releases.


Kiryu&#x27;s comments are from an investor Q&amp;A from November just recently published in English, in which he addressed multiple questions - in particular regarding the company&#x27;s medium-term business plan and what Kiryu described as &quot;the limited diversity of our title portfolio&quot;.


&quot;Because we possess strong IPs like the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy franchises, I believe that we have tended to be overly reliant on certain gameplay styles or genres,&quot; he said. &quot;Meanwhile, the tastes of customers in the gaming market have diversified, and customers have come to enjoy content from a variety of genres.&quot;

                              <span>Pablo Schreiber, the face (quite literally) behind Master Chief&#x27;s helmet in Paramount&#x27;s Halo adaptation, thinks it was a &quot;huge mistake&quot; to introduce a romantic relationship for the Spartan warrior. In fact, he pushed back against it. 


As a reminder, in the first season of Halo, Schreiber&#x27;s John-117 has sex with human-turned-Covenant agent Makee, as Cortana watches on. They were Cortana in the act, if you will. 


While the intercorse itself wasn&#x27;t actually shown, with the two lovers merely seen touching scars and so on before waking up in bed together, it is very heavily implied. Many felt this was a mistake for the series, along with Master Chief showing both his face and his naked derriere.

Last month, players using the game&#x27;s colour blind options reported falling ill with vertigo and migraines, and many people spoke about the need for changes on social media.
Tekken 8 director Katushiro Harada responded and said people had &quot;misunderstood&quot; the accessibility options, which developer Bandai Namco had &quot;never claimed or publicised&quot; would be useful to all colour blind players.

Eight percent of respondees to GDC&#x27;s newly-published 2024 State of the Game Industry report say they are developing their current project for Nintendo Switch 2. Out of 3000 people polled, that accounts for 240 responses.


Nintendo recently issued a blanket denial to address various reports that have mapped out the company&#x27;s ongoing march towards launching the inevitable Switch successor.

                              <span>35 percent of game developers have been impacted by layoffs in the last 12 months and half are concerned more job cuts are on the way. That&#x27;s according to GDC&#x27;s newly published 2024 State of the Game Industry report, which highlights current sentiment among developers based on a snapshot of 3,000 industry professionals polled.


According to the report, while 54 percent of developers canvassed said there had been no layoffs at their company over the last year, 35 percent said either they or their colleagues had lost their jobs. Quality assurance positions are said to have been hit the hardest, with 22 percent of QA workers saying they&#x27;d been laid off compared to seven percent of all developers.


56 percent of those polled said they were concerned their company could announce more layoffs in the next 12 months, with many citing post-pandemic course correction, studio conglomeration, and economic uncertainty as possible explanations.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s January Xbox Developer Direct has been and gone, bringing first looks and long-awaited release news for some of the company&#x27;s most highly anticipated titles. MachineGames&#x27; Indiana Jones was the biggie of course, showcasing first gameplay and featuring confirmation of a 2024 release, but there was more besides, with Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2, Avowed, and Oxide Games&#x27; Ara: History Untold all putting in an appearance.


And if you missed the showcase - which included a surprise visit from Square Enix to offer another look at this year&#x27;s Visions of Mana - you&#x27;ll find a brisk round-up below.

Obsidian shows off more Avowed and it&#x27;s launching this autumn

                              <span>MachineGames has given us our first look at its Indiana Jones game, now officially called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (as suspected). And that&#x27;s not all! We officially now know it is coming this year. Get your fedoras at the ready, our beloved professor will be whipping his way onto Xbox Series X/S and PC, including Game Pass, in 2024.


Thanks to the new footage, which was shared at this evening&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we also have some nice background bits about the upcoming game, which we will play through the eyes of Indy as a lot of it is first person (it&#x27;s the &quot;ideal perspective,&quot; the developer said). Oh, and Todd Howard also popped up to compliment how accommodating Lucasfilm has been. 


Now, let&#x27;s talk new footage. It, of course, all started with Nazis, with the Great Circle taking place between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade (and yes, Indy looks like Harrison Ford complete with scar on chin). Oh, I really want this to be Xbox&#x27;s Uncharted but more. The new footage provides plenty of little gameplay snippets that are also in the films, such as a hole filled with spiders that I assume has a lever inside. Indy is shown reaching in as a spider pops out, anyway.

Via a deeper dive into the game, Oxide showed some of its world leaders and infamous players in history whose skills you&#x27;ll be able to use as you build your own version of history on an alternate Earth. Jeanne d&#x27;Arc, Boudica and Genghis Khan are all on the list.


You win games by competing against rivals, taking turns simultaneously while trying to gain Prestige - such as by constructing Triumphs, monuments from throughout history such as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

The launch window was announced during tonight&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct livestream, along with a short look at combat, quests, and the game&#x27;s environments.
Players will be able to quickly switch between playstyles using custom loadouts, meaning you can quickly switch from a melee build to a ranged magic build in the middle of combat.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters, the acclaimed turn-based tactics game from Complex Games, is launching for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Series X/S on 20th February.


Daemonhunters originally launched for PC back in 2022, delivering what Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a &quot;brutal but graceful and comprehensible mix of ideas from Warhammer, XCOM and Gears Tactics&quot;. Also, Andy Serkis is in it.


The whole thing is focused on the Grey Knights, a mysterious Chapter of the Space Marines, who go up against the Death Guard and the forces of Chaos god Nurgle in a story told across a cinematic, narrative-driven campaign. It features a fully customisable squad of units - which can be tailored with different skills, psychic abilities, equipment, armour, class specialisations, voices, and facial options - and is, all in all, a jolly good old time.

                              <span>Rockstar has announced it&#x27;s removing Grand Theft Auto Online&#x27;s clips editor on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from 20th February this year, explaining it&#x27;s making the move as it approaches the &quot;limits of what&#x27;s possible&quot; on previous-generation consoles.


The clips editor - officially known as the Rockstar Editor - was introduced back in 2015, enabling players to create, edit, and share videos of Grand Theft Auto 5 and Grand Theft Auto Online. However, from 20th February, the editor, including all clips and projects saved within, will no longer be available to PS4 and Xbox One users.


&quot;As we begin to approach the limits of what&#x27;s possible within the technical capacity of previous-generation consoles,&quot; Rockstar explained in a post on its blog, &quot;we are taking necessary steps to allow for future GTA Online updates on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.&quot; It added that removing the editor from last-gen consoles will &quot;help to ensure the stability of these platforms and keep them updated with GTA Online additions for as long as possible.&quot;

                              <span>This is a fascinating story.
Last spring, a friend of a friend visited my office and invited me to Langley to speak to Invisible Ink, the CIA’s creative writing group.
I asked Vivian (not her real name) what she wanted me to talk about.

I asked what level the writers in the group were.
She said the group had writers of all levels.
I asked what the speaking fee was.
She said that as far as she knew, there was no speaking fee.

What I want to know is, why haven’t I been invited? There are nonfiction writers in that group...</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re going to get a look at some of Microsoft&#x27;s big new Xbox games tonight, in a brand new Xbox Developer Direct. We&#x27;ve been promised a look at the new Indiana Jones game, Obsidian&#x27;s new RPG Avowed, and Ninja Theory&#x27;s Hellblade 2.
We&#x27;ll be watching and covering it all live, from the moment it begins at 8pm UK time (GMT), to the moment it ends an hour later. And it&#x27;ll be much more fun with your comments and reactions, so please join us in the comments below.
So, what exactly can we expect? Well, Indiana Jones developer MachineGames - the team behind the brilliant Wolfenstein games - will apparently show more than 10 minutes of the game, detailing how it&#x27;s played, the story, the setting, and premiering a first trailer.

                              <span>Polish video game developer and publisher CI Games has laid off 10 percent of its staff. 


The company, perhaps best known for Lords of the Fallen, told Eurogamer this was a &quot;tough but necessary&quot; decision  it believes will help &quot;preserve business strength and stability&quot;.


According to our sister site GamesIndustry.biz, these layoffs will affect employees from across the company, including Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks, Sniper Ghost Warrior studio Underdog and the &quot;majority&quot; of CI Games&#x27; marketing team.

                              <span>Bethesda has at last officially announced The Elder Scrolls: Castles, its Fallout Shelter-style mobile game which popped up last year, ahead of a full launch.

Now, the game is being rolled out on Android and iOS, with a staggered release across different regions. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases.

                              <span>An unannounced Far Cry spin-off game known as Captain Laserhawk Niji Warrior has been rated by European classification board PEGI. While nothing official has been announced, this listing suggests a proper unveiling may be on the way soon


Spotted by Game Rant, PEGI&#x27;s listing states the yet-to-be-revealed title will see players pitted against each other in some kind of &quot;laser deathmatch&quot;, with the person clocking up the most kills declared the winner. 


Captain Laserhawk Niji Warrior has been rated 12 by PEGI, with mention of &quot;moderate violence to human-like characters&quot;. It will also include purchasable in-game items, such as cosmetics. The PEGI rating here is for PC.

The move follows Harmonix&#x27;s launch of Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like mode playable within Fortnite, at the end of last year - and the beginning of weekly track releases for that.


Rock Band 4 now features a library of nearly 3000 songs - and access to these isn&#x27;t going anywhere to anyone who has bought them. But no more will launch after the end of this month.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive is reportedly the latest studio to be hit by layoffs this year. 


Sources close to the matter told Kotaku roughly 45 people had been laid off between 9th and 11th January, although layoffs started in December. Those affected were part of the Montreal studio.


According to the report, these cuts have been across multiple departments.

Hundred Star Games&#x27; existence certainly isn&#x27;t a secret - it already has a website and a detailed Great Place to Work listing - but its connection to Hill and Walker has only just started to become more widely known thanks to a new report by Polygon, which spotted the duo were named as Hundred Star&#x27;s directors on corporate data website Endole.


Hundred Star hasn&#x27;t yet announced itself to press, and only a limited amount of information is currently available. On Great Place to Work, the East London studio says its ethos is to create a &quot;small team of only 100 industry veterans and emerging talents, who are committed to crafting cutting-edge gaming experiences that inspire and captivate players worldwide.&quot;

Word of Coolidge&#x27;s arrival on the project comes via Deadline, but the publication offers no word on the role she&#x27;ll be playing. That&#x27;s to be expected, given story details are being kept under wraps - although a report last year suggested it would focus on a &quot;malevolent Ender Dragon who sets out on a path of destruction&quot;.


Coolidge - who strode back into the spotlight with her widely acclaimed two-season portrayal of Tanya McQuoid in HBO&#x27;s stellar 2021 series White Lotus following an already impressive decades-long acting career - joins a cast including Game of Thrones&#x27; Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jack Black.

                              <span>Developer Supermassive&#x27;s acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn is being turned into a movie by the writer and director of 2017 horror hit Annabelle: Creation.


Until Dawn, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, released for PS4 back in 2015, delivering an interactive spin on the teen slasher genre - with a cast including Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere - where players could influence who lived and who died through the choices they made along its branching narrative. It was a cheesy, atmospheric, and hugely enjoyable romp, establishing the template Supermassive would later revisit in its recent Dark Pictures Anthology series.


Given that much of Until Dawn&#x27;s appeal came from the novelty of navigating through a whole bunch of knowingly trope-y slasher conventions (who hasn&#x27;t pondered if they&#x27;d have what it takes to survive a horror movie and become Final Girl), it&#x27;s perhaps an unexpected choice for a big screen adaptation - but the film&#x27;s being described as a &quot;R-rated love letter to the horror genre&quot;, suggesting it&#x27;ll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.

                              <span>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has vowed more legal action against Apple, just days after the US Supreme Court dismissed both parties&#x27; further attempts to appeal a 2021 California court ruling on the Epic vs. Apple antitrust lawsuit.


Epic initially launched court proceedings against Apple back in August 2020, after the company revoked Epic&#x27;s Fortnite developer account, preventing the game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple&#x27;s 30 percent platform fees.


A decision on Epic&#x27;s lawsuit came in September 2021, when Judge Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. Gonzalez-Rogers did, however, side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps - a practice known as &quot;anti-steering&quot; - as that would constitute &quot;anti-competitive conduct&quot; under state law.

                              <span>Swedish video game holding company Thunderful Group is to implement a &quot;restructuring programme&quot;, which will see around a fifth of its workforce laid off.


Thunderful, which owns multiple development studios and publishers including Coatsink and  Somerville developer Jumpship, said this programme aims to &quot;strengthen the Group&#x27;s long-term competitive position&quot; by lowering costs and &quot;increasing focus on areas with the best future growth and profitability prospects&quot;. 


This will include staff reductions of approximately 20 percent, as well as the &quot;divestment of non-strategic assets&quot;.

                              <span>No, sorry, there won&#x27;t be a Bill and Frank TV spin-off for The Last of Us after all. Series co-creator Craig Mazin has said the crew is happy with what it accomplished with those characters in the first season, and as such &quot;there won&#x27;t be more Bill and Frank&quot;.
Mazin&#x27;s comments come after Bill actor Nick Offerman said a The Last of Us spin-off following the two survivors had been pitched to HBO. &quot;I think we pitched a whole mini-series of a prequel of their lives before they met each other,&quot; Offerman said, before joking: &quot;It could be a musical. We&#x27;re not short on ideas. We&#x27;ll just, we&#x27;ll see what Craig [Mazin] and Neil [Druckmann] come up with.&quot;
Speaking with Deadline, Mazin reiterated that Offerman was joking with his previous comments, which were made following the actor&#x27;s Emmy win. &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of the episode we did with Bill and Frank,&quot; Mazin said, later adding: &quot;We are very happy with what we achieved.&quot;

                              <span>Yes, Paradox Interactive has increased the price of its expansion subscription to Europa Universalis 4 in multiple regions, but not to the extent some players were worried about. 
Yesterday, several Canadian players shared emails they received from Steam which said the monthly price for their subscription had gone up to $122, a 21-fold increase on its initial price of $5.70. 
The price in Canada was quickly updated to $10.99, a much more sensible figure.

The director was asked by VGC his thoughts on the backlash remakes and remasters - such as Naughty Dog&#x27;s upcoming native PS5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 - are often met with. After all, the original game came out less than four years ago. 


&quot;I don&#x27;t understand some of the consternation about what The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered offers,&quot; Gallant replied, adding he believes this release is &quot;the best way to play The Last of Us Part 2, if you&#x27;re a new PlayStation owner and new to the franchise&quot;.

                              <span>Yesterday, Shiba Inu Peanut Butter became the first dog to speedrun a game during Awesome Games Done Quick.
The fundraising event is currently underway, having begun on Sunday. As previously reported, streamer JSR_&#x27;s pet dog Peanut Butter was scheduled to be the first pet, and the first dog, to complete a speedrun for AGDQ.
Peanut Butter speedran Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES, in 26 minutes and 24 seconds, which is around a minute slower than his own world record, but well within the 30 minute slot he&#x27;d been allocated. Frankly, every Peanut Butter run is a PB record.

                              <span>Voice artist Cody Christian, who plays Cloud in the forthcoming Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, thinks &quot;shippers&quot; who &quot;overtly sexualise every relationship can ruin great story development&quot;.

Christian made the comments on X, formerly Twitter, following the latest trailer for Rebirth shared by Square Enix. Longtime fans of the original Final Fantasy 7 game (as well as Remake) have plenty of opinions on who Cloud&#x27;s love interest should be in the Tifa/Aerith love triangle, which has caused plenty of heated online debates.



&quot;&#x27;Shippers&#x27; crumble under the idea that a character is allowed to have significant relationships with MULTIPLE characters. This provides overarching depth,&quot; said Christian (thanks Games Radar). &quot;The need to overtly sexualize every relationship can ruin great story development.&quot;

It&#x27;s been 13 years since the last game in the series, Top Spin 4, was released on the PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii, and Xbox 360.
TopSpin 2K25 was announced yesterday, in conjunction with the opening day of the main draw at the Australian Open. Check out the first trailer below.

                              <span>You won&#x27;t find any Larian Studios games on a subscription service, said its CEO Swen Vincke.


In a thread on X, formerly Twitter, Vincke shared his views on subscription models in response to yesterday&#x27;s news that Ubisoft is evolving its service. Ubisoft&#x27;s director of subscription Philippe Tremblay said players need to be &quot;comfortable&quot; not owning games when discussing the range of consumer behaviour.


&quot;Whatever the future of games looks like, content will always be king,&quot; said Vincke. &quot;But it&#x27;s going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not. Direct from developer to players is the way.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Embark Studios has today released its shiny 1.5.0 update for The Finals, adding a new limited-time Solo Bank It mode, as well as a variety of bug fixes and further anti-cheat measures.


First off, that new mode. Embark calls Solo Bank It both &quot;experimental&quot; and a &quot;fast-paced all-in-action&quot; experience, so you are sure to be kept on your toes. It pits 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. Those taking on Solo Bank It need to scoop up a total of 40,000 Cash to claim victory. 


The developer notes strategy is a key factor in this mode, as you won&#x27;t have a squad backing you up for you to rely on. You can see a little tease of what&#x27;s in store via the video below.

                              <span>Wakerunners is the next game from Mintrocket, the studio behind Dave the Diver.


The game is described as a team battle game with a top-down perspective set in a dystopian sci-fi future. So, quite the change from catching fish under the sea.


If you&#x27;re keen to check it out, a demo will be available during Steam Next Fest from 5th February.

                              <span>It looks like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s save bug woes on Xbox Series X/S might finally - fingers crossed - be at an end. The long-awaited fix that developer Larian Studios recently promised would arrive this week is now available to download.


Xbox players have suffered save game woes ever since Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 made its delayed debut on the console at the end of last year, with reports soon emerging that hard-earned progress was being wiped after crashing. Unfortunately, the issue has persisted as the weeks have gone by, and Larian recently confirmed a permanent fix would require a console update from Microsoft, which was still in the works at the time.


Finally though, after an agonising five-and-a-half-week wait, Microsoft&#x27;s long-promised fix is now here. Its arrival was confirmed by the official Xbox Support account on social media, which tweeted, &quot;An Xbox System Update will be rolling out from today to address the Save Game issue on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.&quot; All Xbox Series X/S players should automatically receive the update within the next week, it noted, but those wanting it sooner can manually force the update immediately via their console&#x27;s Settings menu.

                              <span>With Diablo 4&#x27;s third season of post-launch content - now officially titled Season of the Construct - rapidly approaching, Blizzard has finally deemed it time to share some details about what it&#x27;ll bring when it arrives on 23rd January next week.


&quot;Ancient forces threaten Sanctuary,&quot; the studio writes in a bout of scene-setting over on its blog. &quot;Aided by your Seneschal Companion, hazard the many traps and devastating Constructs beneath the deserts of Kehjistan.&quot; Here, it continues, &quot;elemental forces are amassing for malicious whims of the demon Malphas. Only by descending far below the surface will you be able to cull this cursed threat from its root.&quot;


Breaking that down into more specific terms, Season of the Construct introduces the seasonal robotic Seneschal Companion - available during the Seasonal Questline - a new dungeon type Blizzard is calling Vaults, weekly leaderboards in The Gauntlet, and a number of &quot;key&quot; new quality of life features, including WASD movement support on PC.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve not heard much about Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered since its unveiling back in September last year, but now developer Aspyr has emerged to share further details about what players can expect - including control toggles and a photo mode - when Lara Croft&#x27;s spruced-up early adventures come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC, on 14th February.


Writing in a new post on the PlayStation Blog, Aspyr explains it wanted to focus on &quot;additions instead of revisions&quot; when developing Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, saying it believes the &quot;gameplay of [the originals] is timeless.&quot;


To that end, it&#x27;s adding the option to toggle between the three games&#x27; &quot;classic&quot; tank-like controls and a more modern alternative, which takes inspiration from Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld; here, full camera control is mapped to the right stick, while Lara moves directionally based on the camera position.

                              <span>It looks like the wait for Final Fantasy 14 Online on Xbox Series X/S could be ending very soon; Microsoft today announced that an open beta for the acclaimed MMORPG was now &quot;officially available&quot; before yanking the post and tweeting to say it had &quot;incorrectly&quot; shared the news.


Final Fantasy 14 has been a long time coming to Xbox; it launched for PC and PlayStation back in 2013, but it wasn&#x27;t until last summer that Microsoft and developer Square Enix confirmed it&#x27;d finally be making the leap to Xbox - specifically Xbox Series X/S consoles - in &quot;spring 2024&quot;.


At the time, Microsoft said Final Fantasy 14 Online&#x27;s full Xbox arrival would be preceded by an open beta, planned to coincide with the game&#x27;s patch 6.5X. And with Patch 6.55 out today, 16th January, signs suggest Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Xbox open beta is imminent.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; 11th season is right around the corner, and it looks like its arrival next Tuesday, 23rd January, could very well bring the most radical overhaul for the multiplayer pirate adventure since its launch back in 2018. Behold the advent of fast-travel.


As per Rare&#x27;s latest video update, Sea of Thieves&#x27; Season 11 makes sweeping changes to the way voyages are accessed and activated. Previously, voyages - essentially self-contained quests directing players to specific themed activities, if you&#x27;re familiar - could only be purchased from trading company representatives at one of the game&#x27;s starting outposts. That meant a whole lot of time spent engaged in often wholly uneventful sailing as you traversed back and forth across the map to pick up new voyages, drop off loot, and on.


From Season 11 onward, however, all voyages will be immediately accessible at any time from the updated Quest Table on your ship. Here, you&#x27;ll get on-demand access to trading company voyages (ranked by length), Tall Tales, and more, meaning you can dive straight into any voyage type you fancy without first needing to take a lengthy trip back to an outpost to buy it.

                              <span>Popular jail simulator Prison Architect will get a 3D successor, and it&#x27;ll release on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th March.


British developer Double Eleven and publisher Paradox Interactive made the announcement today, and confirmed a £35 pricetag ($40/€40). 


As you can see from the reveal trailer below, Prison Architect 2 (as it&#x27;s unsurprisingly titled) has been rebuilt from the ground up as a 3D experience, unlocking the ability to build across multiple floors in a sandboxy environment with ease.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?“:
Abstract: We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI’s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants’ language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</span>

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming team shooter Foamstars will have a small amount of AI art, the developer has said.


Speaking with VGC, Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani said the team had &quot;dabbled&quot; with AI program Midjourney - a known AI tool that converts text into art - but the majority of the game has been crafted by hand.


&quot;All of the core elements in Foamstars - the core gameplay, and the things that make the game enjoyable - those are all made by hand,&quot; Okatani said.

                              <span>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has revealed a release date for the survival horror sequel of 5th September, 2024.
This marks a further delay to the game, which was intially meant to release in April 2022. Since then, the game has been delayed several times for polishing and due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Most recently, Stalker 2 was rumoured to be releasing in December 2023 before GSC Game World pencilled in a launch window of Q1 2024.
&quot;While there is absolutely no way to make another delay sound less dim,&quot; GSC Game World said in a press statement, &quot;we decided to be clear about our reasons to postpone the game for the sake of yet another wave of polishing.&quot; GSC stated the game contained &quot;certain technical imperfections&quot; at the beginning of the year, making it clear the game &quot;needed more time in the oven&quot;.

                              <span>Creative Assembly has announced a free update for strategy game Total War: Pharaoh will be available from next week.
Titled High Tide, the update will add two new factions from the Sea Peoples culture, Sherden and Peleset, who are more than willing to drive the Bronze Age Collapse. Alongside the factions are 37 new units to use in battle.
Sea Peoples factions have access to new mechanics including War Spoils, in which you can raze settlements to raise resources, and will benefit from the Crisis and Collapse world states which put other factions at a disadvantage.

                              <span>Microsoft has revealed its next batch of Game Pass titles for January and into the start of February.


Notable additions with this wave include Persona 3 Reload and Palworld (aka Pokémon with guns, see picture above). Persona 3 Reload (Cloud, Console, and PC) will arrive early next month, on 2nd February. 


&quot;I can say that Persona 3 Reload&#x27;s promise is undeniable,&quot; wrote Henry Stockdale in Eurogamer&#x27;s preview of the game. &quot;Remaking an RPG with such a vast legacy would prove daunting for many, yet even with the omissions, Atlus is building on the original game&#x27;s foundations well. After many years of waiting, I&#x27;m excited to dive in properly next month.&quot;

                              <span>Take Two Interactive has entered a trademark dispute with Remedy Entertainment, and says the latter&#x27;s logo resembles the R* of Rockstar Games.


Remedy revealed this logo in a blog post back in April last year. &quot;The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old,&quot; it wrote at the time. &quot;It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today&#x27;s Remedy.&quot;


The new logo is a stylised R, but as reported by RespawnFirst, this has been opposed by Take-Two as &quot;there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public&quot;.

                              <span>The previously-delayed Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology has been postponed again - this time until 20th February. 


In a statement on the latest holdup, publisher Soma Games said the decision was a &quot;tactical move&quot; to aim for a different release window. 


The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology was previously set to arrive on 30th January for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. It&#x27;s a linear, story-based action adventure set in the world of Brian Jacques&#x27; brilliant children&#x27;s fantasy books, collecting three acts previously sold separately.

Street Fighter 6 had sold 2m units within a month of its release, after an extremely popular launch weekend.

                              <span>Ubisoft has updated its subscription model, and said consumers need to be &quot;comfortable with not owning [their] game&quot;.


Ubisoft+ will now feature two revised tiers. Ubisoft+ Premium (£14.99/$17.99 per month) will include all new releases and - in some cases - early access to games alongside premium editions, monthly rewards and more. Ubisoft+ Classics on PC, meanwhile, is a brand new curated selection of popular back-catalogue and live games (£6.99/$7.99 per month).


Director of subscription Philippe Tremblay told GamesIndustry.biz there is &quot;tremendous opportunity for growth&quot; for subscription models, but the mindset of consumers needs to change.

                              <span>The director of Warner Bros&#x27; upcoming Minecraft film adaptation wants to avoid any kind of fan reaction akin to that &#x27;Ugly Sonic&#x27; reveal. 


As a reminder, &#x27;Ugly Sonic&#x27; was the original design for Sonic from the 2020 film, starring Jim Carrey and James Marsden. On Sonic&#x27;s initial full reveal in the first trailer, many were left unimpressed (to put it mildly) by the direction the designers had gone. But even before that there was concern, when posters teasing Sonic&#x27;s cinematic release showed the hedgehog&#x27;s oddly lithe silhouette and his nightmarish legs.


In fact, the criticism surrounding Sonic&#x27;s seemingly final look was so loud, the team went back to the drawing board and redesigned the titular blue hedgehog to a less controversial model. If you need a reminder, you can see the Sonic designs in the video below.

                              <span>Raven Software was at one time working on a standalone live-service version of Call of Duty&#x27;s popular Zombies mode, ex-Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt has revealed, but it was cancelled after its IP originator - presumably Treyarch - &quot;wanted it back&quot;.


That small revelation comes via Gummelt&#x27;s LinkedIn page (as spotted by MP1ST), which explains he was lead designer on an &quot;ambitious new Call of Duty: Zombies live service project&quot; between 2011 and 2012, but that the whole thing was canceled &quot;when the [Activision] studio that &#x27;owned&#x27; that part of the Call of Duty IP wanted it back.&quot;


Gummelt doesn&#x27;t explicitly state the name of the studio, but it seems reasonable to assume he&#x27;s referring to developer Treyarch, who created the mode for 2008&#x27;s Call of Duty: World at War.

                              <span>Last week, Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller caused controversy among players by revealing major gameply changes that&#x27;ll see tank and damage heroes receive a &quot;modified, tuned-down version of the Support self-healing passive&quot; in Season 9 - and Keller has now admitted it was a &quot;mistake&quot; to make the announcement &quot;out of context&quot;.


In his original announcement on the Overwatch blog, Keller explained the changes - part of a wider gameplay overhaul intended to reduce &#x27;frustration&#x27; when teams aren&#x27;t working together - should &quot;give non-Support players more options in terms of sustaining themselves&quot; and &quot;take some of the pressure off Support players to keep everyone alive since individual players now have more control of their own health pool.&quot; The idea, he explained, was to shift the balance &quot;between the power of a team and the power of an individual hero or player.&quot;


Since that announcement, there&#x27;ve been concerns among the Overwatch community that the changes might fundamental undermine the team-based spirit of Overwatch, while others have worried the shift may risk making Support characters redundant.

                              <span>Studio Wildcard has announced revised release dates for Ark: Survival Ascended&#x27;s The Center and Scorched Earth expansion map remasters following a delay for the latter last year, confirming they&#x27;ll arrival in February and April respectively.


A spruced-up version of Scorched Earth was originally due to launch alongside Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price remaster of Wildcard&#x27;s 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved - last year. However, in July, the studio announced that not only was it pushing the launch of the base game back to October, its expansions would be delayed too.


As per its revised plans, Scorched Earth was now targeting a December launch, with Ascended&#x27;s remastered Ragnarok and Aberration maps due in &quot;Q1 2024&quot;. Unfortunately, it became apparent Wildcard&#x27;s propensity for delays had struck again when a updated roadmap released in December showed Scorched Earth was now due in March 2024, with Aberration aiming for July 2024 and Raganarok not unexpected until September.

                              <span>Rebel Wolves - the studio formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - has confirmed its first project will be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker, after the title was reported online toward the end of last year.


When Rebel Wolves announced its existence in 2022, the studio said its mission was to &quot;evolve the cRPG genre by creating unforgettable stories and stirring deep emotions&quot;, confirming its first project would be a then-unnamed &quot;AAA dark fantasy built inside the Unreal 5 engine&quot;.


Since then, official word on Rebel Wolves&#x27; debut game has been limited, although CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as a secondary director on Cyberpunk 2077 while at CD Projekt - did tease it wouldn&#x27;t &quot;be as gigantic as The Witcher&quot; but could well have a &quot;greater&quot; number of quests. In the same interview, he also suggested the project would be around the same size as the Witcher 3&#x27;s Blood and Wine expansion.

                              <span>GAME, the UK&#x27;s biggest high street video game retailer, will no longer allow customers to trade in physical video games from next month, staff have told Eurogamer. 


The chain is expected to end its long-running video game trade-in facility on 16th February, with remaining pre-owned stock continuing to be sold until it has run out.


GAME staff have been told of the change, and Eurogamer has corroborated this with multiple branches of the retailer nationwide. We&#x27;ve contacted GAME itself for more.

                              <span>Elden Ring has received a new DLC listing as part of an update on Steam. While nothing official has been announced by developer FromSoftware as yet, there is a high chance this update relates to the game&#x27;s upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.


The update was shared by Ziostorm on X, after the user noticed Elden Ring&#x27;s DLC category had been amended on SteamDB. The update in question doesn&#x27;t have a name, and is merely listed as &quot;SteamDB Unknown App 2778580&quot; for now. However, many have speculated the developer will be making an announcement regarding the expansion&#x27;s release date in the near future. We will keep you posted. 


Other DLC listed in this section of Elden Ring&#x27;s Steam page includes the game&#x27;s digital artbook and soundtrack, as well as its Adventure Guide.

                              <span>Ahead of its release in just over a month, Square Enix has shared a new preview and trailer of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth now it&#x27;s available to pre-order.


The new blog post shares information on some of the locations and characters in the game, including an explanation of how Cait Sith will fight in battle.


Fans of the original game will be aware that Cait Sith usually fights atop his moogle companion, but in Rebirth he can fight solo too.

The actor reshared a post from web3 company WAME, which offered GTA fans the chance to have a &quot;realistic voice conversation&quot; with Michael. &quot;This is fucking bullshit,&quot; Luke wrote in response, tagging WAME.


&quot;Absolutely nothing cool about ripping people off with some lame computer estimation of my voice. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GARBAGE...&quot;

Eddy has been in every main Tekken game since Tekken 3, and though he&#x27;s missing from the base roster in Tekken 8, he&#x27;ll be playable as part of the first season pass.
There&#x27;s no word on when the season pass will begin, but Bandai Namco has it down for spring 2024. Take a look at Eddy&#x27;s reveal in the video below (which Bandai Namco snuck in at the end).

These layoffs are the latest in the restructuring programme of Embracer, the umbrella company which owns Borderlands developer Gearbox (which in turn owns Lost Boys Interactive).

TiavioliGaming on Twitch has already completed all three Dark Souls games using a violin, and is now taking on Elden Ring as his next challenge.

TiavioliGaming caught the eye of the Elden Ring subreddit recently, thanks to a TikTok clip of him defeating Godfrey with his violin - all at a rather calm heart rate of 80bpm.

While the story of The Last of Us Part 2 is already widely known, given it initally released in 2020, several videos making their way around the internet currently include content not in the original, such as the Lost Levels (with potential spoilers), new skins and No Return gameplay.

The delay was announced by the official Pokémon account on X, though no reason for the extra hold-up was mentioned. The series had previously been set to launch in the US next month. 


Pokémon Horizons is the new Pokémon anime series with fresh protagonists (including Captain Pikachu) and a new story, following the conclusion of Ash Ketchum&#x27;s long journey to become a Pokémon Master.

                              <span>The mysterious, long-rumoured Halo battle royale project from series co-developer Certain Affinity is no longer in development, a new report has claimed.


Speaking on the XboxEra podcast, reliable insider Shpeshal_Nick said the game, codenamed Project Tatanka, had seemingly been cancelled.


While officially unannounced by Microsoft itself, Certain Affinity had discussed the project publicly in broad terms several times, and said in late 2022 that it had been in the works for more than two years, with nearly 100 people then working on it.

                              <span>Faheem Rashad Najm, aka T-Pain, is working on GTA 6 with Rockstar. 


The Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter, known for his penchant for auto-tune and singing about apple-bottom jeans and those boots with the fur along with Flo Rida, confirmed the news during a livestream.


However, this news arrived not because T-Pain was announcing his collaboration with Rockstar specifically, but because he was lamenting on an unexpected consequence of his new gig: the fact he can no longer roleplay on NoPixel, a GTA roleplay server.

Last week, James Lambert announced he had taken down the playable build of Portal 64 at Valve&#x27;s request due to its dependence on &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s proprietary libraries&quot;. 
In an update video uploaded over the weekend, Lambert said he expected Valve would ask him to take Portal 64 down &quot;because it&#x27;s their IP on a Nintendo console&quot;. &quot;Somebody from Valve reached out to me and I was put in contact with their legal team,&quot; he revealed.

want to know more and get involved with the work SIG Release does, read on!
SIG Release plays a crucial role in the development and evolution of Kubernetes.
Its primary responsibility is to manage the release process of new versions of Kubernetes.
It operates on a regular release cycle, typically every three to four months.
During this cycle, the Kubernetes Release Team works closely with other SIGs an…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re just a week away from the launch of Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for PlayStation 5, and the studio has now announced it&#x27;ll be marking its arrival with Grounded 2 - an official making-of documentary that&#x27;ll be free to watch on YouTube.


Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, to give it its full name, is the sequel to Naughty Dog&#x27;s 85-minute making-of documentary for the original Last of Us, which launched back in 2015 and charted the &quot;dogged development and unique philosophy&quot; of the first game.


Filming of the newly announced follow-up - as per the spoiler-y trailer below - started in 2016 but was abandoned when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020. However, the existing footage has now been revisited and assembled into a making-of documentary that doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll entirely shy away from the more negative aspects of development at Naughty Dog, including crunch - a practice said to be particularly brutal at the studio in a report back in 2020.

                              <span>With Bethesda looking to ramp up the frequency of its Starfield updates in 2024 - it recently committed to a &quot;roughly every six weeks&quot; schedule starting in February - the studio is kicking off the new year by putting its latest patch into Steam beta next Wednesday, 17th January, with the promise of &quot;over 100 fixes and improvements&quot;.


Bethesda says it&#x27;ll share the full update notes when the Steam beta goes live on Wednesday but, ahead of launch, it&#x27;s teased a number of included improvements in a series of posts on social media. Next week&#x27;s update will, for instance, introduce improved textures, lighting, and shadows - the accompanying screenshots point to far more natural illumination on character&#x27;s faces, for instance - as well as additional widescreen support and stability improvements. 


Bethesda is also promising a &quot;multitude of fixes&quot; to quests, remedying the likes of docking and data transfer problems in Eye of the Storm, as well as preventing exploration blockers caused by missing temples in Into the Unknown.

                              <span>American Truck Simulator&#x27;s list of confirmed future stops is beginning to stack up; not only has developer SCS Software revealed trips to Nebraska and Arkansas are on the way, it&#x27;s announced it&#x27;ll be pulling into Missouri when those two expansions are done.


News that development on Missouri is now underway brings the total list of explorable states released or announced for American Truck Simulator since its launch in 2016 all the way up to 16. So far, players can trundle their way across California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma, with Nebraska, Arkansas and Missouri still to come (presumably in that order).


Announcing the Missouri expansion on Steam - which actually happened just before Christmas but I was off and likely in an extended brandy butter stupor at the time, so sorry for the delay - SCS wrote, &quot;Nestled in the heart of the American Midwest, Missouri beckons with a blend of historical significance, natural beauty, and vibrant urban landscapes. Known as the Show-Me State, Missouri invites visitors to explore its diverse offerings.&quot;

Yoshida was interviewed by Sony&#x27;s Shuhei Yoshida on the Game Maker&#x27;s Notebook podcast (Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences) and candidly discussed development of Final Fantasy 14 and 16, as well as the future of the series.


When jokingly asked if he&#x27;s directing Final Fantasy 17, Yoshida replied that nothing has been decided yet. &quot;I&#x27;ve had the chance to work on two of these, 14 and 16, so maybe it&#x27;s time for someone new, instead of having the same old guys handle the next one,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, the well-received Three Kingdoms-era Soulslike from developer Team Ninja, is bundling its base game and all DLC into a single Complete Edition, launching for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC on 7th February.


Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which originally launched last March, serves up a challenging - but surprisingly approachable - action-RPG adventure build around a faster, more aggressive style of combat compared to Team Ninja&#x27;s previous Nioh games.


&quot;A new setting may suggest a new chapter,&quot; Eurogamer contributor Alan Wen wrote in his Recommended review, &quot;but I&#x27;d almost prefer to call Wo Long a Nioh-like, or rather the sequel that Nioh 2 should have been, further refining its systems and customisation, cutting back some if not all bloat, and adding an exciting evolution of its foundations that makes its masocore challenge more approachable on its own terms.&quot;

                              <span>Contrary to its usual image as a company open to fan games and mods, Valve has taken down two well-known community projects.
Both Portal 64, a demake to port the original Portal to the N64, and Team Fortress: Source 2, an effort to &quot;recreate a new [Team Fortress] experience&quot; in the Source 2 engine, were targeted by Valve.
On 10th January, the creators of each project released statements confirming the end of development and that each will no longer be available to download.

There are 11 characters to choose from in quest mode, and there&#x27;s a tutorial mode which introduces players to the basic controls.

Sand Land, for those unaware, is set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply for everyone. Yes, demons and humans. Obviously, something needs to be done about that, and so a rag-tag team sets off in search of the Legendary Spring to bring an end to this thirst.


Sand Land was first announced last year at Summer Games Fest, where we got a look at its arid setting and gorgeous art style. You can see it again now thanks to its new release date trailer, below.

The upcoming Felix the Cat release will include the feline&#x27;s NES title and Game Boy title. Both games will come with a range of new features and &quot;quality of life fixes&quot; for today&#x27;s gaming enjoyment. 


This release will be available physically for those with either a PlayStation console (it is coming to both 4 and 5) or a Nintendo Switch. Konami is handling the digital side of things, and is yet to announce a release date.

                              <span>Capcom has rolled back a recent update to 11-year-old game Resident Evil Revelations which added a DRM called Enigma Protector.
The DRM was noticed after Steam players began reporting errors when launching Revelations last week, including a reduced and unstable framerate, as well as broken mods.
Steam users review bombed Revelations with complaints about Enigma, which prompted Capcom to roll back the game on 9th January (which can be seen on its history via SteamDB).

The upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game features the regular human-voiced cast you&#x27;d expect, bar one character: a tree spirit named Kalux. Kalux only has a small handful of lines throughout the game, but these have been left with work-in-progress generated dialogue.


Ubisoft has said it plans to add human-recorded dialogue at a later date.

                              <span>In a move that feels a little like being catapulted back in time several decades, Ubisoft has released a free playable Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown demo - for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC - ahead of the game&#x27;s full launch next week.


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown revives Ubisoft&#x27;s shamefully long-dormant action-platforming series for a new generation - a new generation that wouldn&#x27;t even have been born when the last game came out in 2008, thanks to Ubisoft&#x27;s dallying - this time sending the prince&#x27;s protector Sargon on a Metroidvania-style quest packed with side-scrolling combat and platform action.


Early word on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - which has been developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the wonderful Rayman Legends and Origins - is reassuringly positive, with Digital Foundry&#x27;s John Linneman calling it a &quot;supremely polished, ultra smooth game that perfectly leverages every platform it has shipped on.&quot;

                              <span>Well here&#x27;s one way of getting yourself some free publicity: casually announce your product will be releasing alongside Switch 2 this &quot;September&quot; so everyone excitedly thinks you might have just accidentally splurged Nintendo&#x27;s big secret, then, when you&#x27;re confronted about it, give a little shrug and admit you were just &quot;guessing&quot;.


That&#x27;s pretty much what happened today when audio company Altec Lansing shared a press release unveiling a partnership with GameShark (now AI Shark) that&#x27;ll see it release a new AI-powered GameShark successor - an announcement casually tossing in the sentence, &quot;The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024.&quot;


Unsurprisingly, Nintendo fans desperate for Switch 2 news following persistent reports the console is launching this year (hello, I am one of these people) immediately began to wonder if Altec Lansing - not a small company by any stretch of the imagination - might have just inadvertently shared some highly confidential information they shouldn&#x27;t have.

                              <span>In a week that&#x27;s already seen Unity and Twitch announce signifiant job cuts, Discord has reportedly told staff it&#x27;ll be laying off around 170 employees - approximately 17 percent of its workforce - as it seeks to &quot;sharpen our focus and... bring more agility to our organisation.&quot;


As reported by The Verge, employees at Discord were informed of the job cuts today by CEO Jason Citron in an all-hands meeting and accompanying internal email.


&quot;Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord&#x27;s workforce by 17%,&quot; Citron wrote in the email shared by The Verge. &quot;This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission over the long term.&quot;

                              <span>What with the launch of couch co-op, Adventures mode and a variety of other free content updates, a Switch version, a new engine, two paid expansions (including an Among Us collaboration), plus news of an animated TV adaptation, 2023 was a busy year for Vampire Survivors. However, creator Poncle isn&#x27;t done yet, and it&#x27;s now share a revised development roadmap (of sorts) for its perennially vampire-free minimalist survival RPG, which includes an update on cross-saves and a potential online co-op mode.


All this comes in a new goodbye 2023/hello 2024 post shared over on Steam, which begins with a recap of the year just gone and a thanks to players before moving onto matters in Vampires Survivors&#x27; near and not-so-near future.


That includes a word on the progress of online co-op support for the game, which Poncle confirmed it was &quot;investigating&quot; back in September last year. A little over three months on and the studio says it&#x27;s &quot;still investigating&quot; the feature, explaining that to &quot;retro-fit online multiplayer in a game as simple as this, but with so much content, is still a huge challenge.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;re big of years but small of shelf space, you might be interested in the newly announced 400 Mini, an officially licensed scaled-down version of Atari&#x27;s four-and-a-half decade old home computer, the Atari 400, which launches on 28th March this year.


Created by Retro Games Ltd - the company previously responsible for the C64 Mini and Amiga 500 Mini - the 400 Mini sports a similar design to Atari&#x27;s 1979 8-bit computer (albeit approximately half the size) but can do a little more beyond its inspiration.


As per Retro Games&#x27; announcement, the 400 Mini (styled THE400 Mini) doesn&#x27;t just emulate the Atari 400 hardware, it&#x27;s also emulates the entire 8-bit Atari range, including the 400&#x27;s pricier sibling the Atari 800, plus the XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

Smart Device Manufacturer Liability and Redress for Third-Party Cyberattack Victims
Abstract: Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks against both their users and third parties. While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device’s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</span>

                              <span>Remember last year, when The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla first suggested a new version of Part 2 was on the horizon? He said players would be able to make his in-game character &quot;play certain themes&quot; during the then-unannounced remastered&#x27;s release. 


Now, we have a closer look at just what Santaolalla was talking about, thanks to a new marketing beat for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.


Santaolalla&#x27;s cameo will actually be part of the game&#x27;s Guitar Free Play mode. Although, rather than playing the guitar as we have seen Joel doing in promo shots for the upcoming release, he will play the banjo.

                              <span>Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal will launch on Nintendo Switch in two weeks time, on 25th January. 


This release will be a souped up version of IOI&#x27;s 2006 title Hitman: Blood Money. It promises a host of improvements across 12 &quot;highly-replayable&quot; missions, including new features such as Instinct Mode, an ever-present minimap, and an array of gameplay improvements inspired by later games in IOI&#x27;s Hitman series. Of course, outfit changes and using as many different weapons and/or methods as you can is fully encouraged.


Here is a little trailer for it all, showing off some shenanigans across the globe. While I have no interest in becoming an assassin myself, I am rather jealous of Agent 47&#x27;s travel opportunities.

                              <span>Developer Core Engage and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have shared a gameplay overview of upcoming city builder New Cycle ahead of its release into early access next week.
New Cycle is described as dieselpunk by Core Engage, as the player is tasked with rebuilding society following a &quot;global catastrophe&quot; caused by solar flares. Settlements begin as very basic and players must progress into industrialisation, then capitalism, all whilst tackling the challenges thrown at them by the environment.
The gameplay overview takes us through each of these stages briefly, showing the transformation from a small hunter-gatherer settlement, to a larger industrial town with electricity and factories, before expanding and building a railway to enable trade and tourism.

Pokémon Go Tour: Sinnoh will debut Origin Forme Dialga and Palkia from 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Legends Arceus - ancient versions of the Legendary creatures from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (the appearance of which is not a surprise, as they were first revealed a little earlier than planned last year). 


Befitting their powerful status and space-time warping properties, the pair will debut a new feature for Pokémon Go named Adventure Effects. These are gameplay-changing abilities unlocked by interacting with the creature itself that can also be boosted further using in-game resources.

                              <span>Nintendo has shed light on the new features available in its Mario vs. Donkey remake for Switch.
The game was announced in September as an &#x27;updated&#x27; version of the original Game Boy Advance title. At the time, Nintendo didn&#x27;t say much else about the re-release, but did say multiplayer will be added.
The new trailer reveals multiplayer will come in the form of local co-op, and it looks like a second player will get to control Toad. Take a look at what&#x27;s in store for Mario in the trailer below.

                              <span>Diablo 4&#x27;s next season is now confirmed to go live later this month, despite Blizzard so far providing us all with very little detail on what it will actually contain.


Season of Blood - the game&#x27;s current season - is set to come to a close soon, with the next season then starting up on 23rd January. So, in just under two weeks.


While Blizzard itself has not &#x27;announced&#x27; this date at the time of writing, a message has been spotted in Diablo 4 itself proclaiming it to be so. As you can see in the image below, when players boot up the game, they are met with a notice on the character selection screen that reads: &quot;Season 3. Next season begins January 23, 2024&quot;.

The odd-looking and robotic-sounding Mario was the work of Proto Hologram, a company that creates holograms held within large box-like structures that you can talk to and interact with. 


More bizarre still, the Mario hologram was supposed to be a collaboration with the AARP, an American advocacy group for people over the age of 50 - apparently to demonstrate how AI holograms could combat loneliness in the elderly. But with Mario? And more to the point - with a poorly-voiced, dead-eyed broken 3D model of Mario?

There are some great Indiana Jones titles out there. There is also Dial of Destiny, but this is not the time or place to discuss that particular release. 


Now, the internet thinks it has worked out the title of MachineGames&#x27; upcoming Indiana Jones game. And it is... Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.


This assumption comes from social media user @Kurakasis, who shared their discovery on X last night. The user revealed that Lucasfilm has been registering a number of domain names that are variations on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle over recent days.

                              <span>A new model of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller with improved battery life has been spotted on a retailer website.
The V2 version of the controller is currently listed on Best Buy Canada at $89.99 and while its features are almost identical to that of the regular DualSense, there are a couple of notable differences. 
The V2 DualSense will have an &quot;exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge&quot; according to the Best Buy listing, and also includes the DualSense charging station (which usually must be bought separately).

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s shares have hit a record high as expectations around Switch 2 continue to grow, and amid speculation Saudi Arabia is set to further invest in Japanese video game stock.


That&#x27;s according to Nikkei Asia (thanks VGC), which reports shares of Nintendo temporarily hit a record 7,902 today on Japan&#x27;s Nikkei stock index - up 5% from yesterday - pushing its market capitalisation over 10 trillion yen ($69bn) for the first time since November 2007.


The publication notes the reason behind the recent surge in Nintendo&#x27;s share price is two-fold. Firstly, growth expectations for the company are high in general, thanks to the success of its intellectual property related business, which recently announced a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, alongside the expected launch of Switch 2.

Well, Medieval Castle (wrongly) won the vote, and some eight months later it looks like the DLC is ready for an imminent release.


That&#x27;s according to a presumably premature reveal on the EA App (thanks SimsCommunity), which provides full details and screenshots of the The Sims 4 Castle Estate Kit, as the new DLC is officially known. It also offers up a release date of 15th October, 2099 - which is almost definitely a placeholder, unless EA really is in it for the long haul where The Sims 4 is concerned.


Weird date aside, everything else in the listing looks accurate. Alongside two screenshots featuring the new DLC pack&#x27;s various building bits in action, we get some blurb explaining the Castle Estate Kit will enable The Sims 4 players to &quot;capture the classic grandeur of a castle&quot;.

                              <span>Mojang and developer Blackbird Interactive have officially brought development on Minecraft Legends to a end today with one final content update, wrapping up a little under nine months of post-launch support for the real-time strategy spin-off.


Releasing in May last year, Minecraft Legends unfortunately didn&#x27;t especially impress, proving to be a decidedly average RTS that failed to do much to justify its use of the Minecraft licence. &quot;It feels too overwhelming and poorly explained for kids,&quot; Eurogamer contributor Caelyn Ellis wrote in her review, &quot;too rudimentary for older players and too frustrating for both. Minecraft is, at least for me, about creativity and experimentation, but there&#x27;s no room for that here.&quot;


Still, Mojang and Blackbird Interactive have continued to support Minecraft Legends with a series of post-launch content updates since its arrival, but Mojang has now confirmed today&#x27;s Snow vs. Snouts update - initially announced during last year&#x27;s Minecraft Live event and originally planned to launch in December - will be its last.

From 16th January, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands will be available for both PS4 and PS5 (the PS4 version is also streamable), giving PlayStation Plus subscribers the chance to sample Gearbox&#x27;s well-received tabletop RPG spin on its raucous shooter series. As for Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil 2 remake, also available for both PS4 and PS5, it gives the 1998 classic a thorough modernising with splashy new presentation and ample mechanical tweaks, and the results are sublime.


Elsewhere, there&#x27;s an opportunity to revisit the PS4 version of the utterly wonderful LEGO City Undercover, developer TT Fusion&#x27;s wildy imaginative and genuinely hilarious open-world take on the familiar Lego game formula, which plays out very much like a family friendly GTA.

                              <span>Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada has asked Native American fans of the series for their thoughts on the designs of fighters Michelle and Julia, and what advice they&#x27;d give to him if he created a new Native American character for the series.
Michelle, a woman of Chinese and Native American descent, appeared in the first Tekken game. Michelle was included in the next games until Tekken 3, which introduced her adoptive daughter Julia. Since then, Julia has appeared in the main series instead, with both making appearances in various Tekken spin-offs. 
Since their first appearances, Michelle and Julia have frequently been brought up in discussions of Indigenous representation in video games. Harada took to X (née Twitter) last week to acknowledge the characters&#x27; importance within the topic, explain the history of their designs, and ask for the opinions of Native American Tekken fans.

                              <span>Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada has asked Native American fans of the series for their thoughts on the designs of fighters Michelle and Julia, and what advice they&#x27;d give to him if he created a new Native American character for the series.
Michelle, a woman of Chinese and Native American descent, appeared in the first Tekken game. Michelle was included in the next games until Tekken 3, which introduced her adoptive daughter Julia. Since then, Julia has appeared in the main series instead, with both making appearances in various Tekken spin-offs. 
Since their first appearances, Michelle and Julia have frequently been brought up in discussions of Indigenous representation in video games. Harada took to X (née Twitter) last week to acknowledge the characters&#x27; importance within the topic, explain the history of their designs, and ask for the opinions of Native American Tekken fans.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 to get us up to speed on what has happened in the series so far. It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom respectively. But what Insomniac and Nintendo didn&#x27;t have (or who they didn&#x27;t have) was Succession&#x27;s Brian Cox to talk us through the story so far. 


Yes, the man that brought Logan Roy to life is here to tell us all about the Devil gene and more. &quot;Every single fight, no matter how big or small, has a story behind it,&quot; the Scottish actor states as dramatic music starts to pound in the background. &quot;There&#x27;s one hell of a story to tell.&quot;


We then get told more about that aforementioned Devil gene, some cliff chucking exploits and the Tekken series&#x27; patricidal puzzle. You can have a watch for yourself below. I don&#x27;t think it is meant to be funny, but it has made me chuckle.

A press release from the union states the agreement has been approved by affected members. It establishes minimum terms and conditions, ensures performer consent and negotiation for AI usage, and requires performers have the opportunity to opt out of AI use in new works.

                              <span>Attendees at this year&#x27;s CES conference have spotted several new faceplates for the PlayStation 5 &#x27;slim&#x27; model, along with their matching DualSense controllers.


The faceplates, shown in the header image above and below (thanks, The Verge), are from the Deep Earth Collection and consist of Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue and Sterling Silver. This collection, you may recall, was also announced for the original PS5 model back in September last year. 

&quot;While crafting this new collection of DualSense controller and PS5 console cover colours, we drew inspiration from the beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth. We elevated the colours by adding a metallic finish for a touch of sophistication,&quot; designer Satoshi Aoyagi said at the time.

                              <span>Attendees at this year&#x27;s CES conference have spotted several new faceplates for the PlayStation 5 &#x27;slim&#x27; model, along with their matching DualSense controllers.


The faceplates, shown in the header image above and below (thanks, The Verge), are from the Deep Earth Collection and consist of Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue and Sterling Silver. This collection, you may recall, was also announced for the original PS5 model back in September last year. 

&quot;While crafting this new collection of DualSense controller and PS5 console cover colours, we drew inspiration from the beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth. We elevated the colours by adding a metallic finish for a touch of sophistication,&quot; designer Satoshi Aoyagi said at the time.

                              <span>UPDATE 10/01/24: Twitch has now confirmed it&#x27;s reducing its workforce.
The news was shared in a new blog post from CEO Dan Clancy, including a copy of the internal email sent to staff. &quot;We greatly value the employees we&#x27;re saying goodbye to today as people and professionals and are grateful for all their efforts to support all of you,&quot; he wrote in the post. &quot;Please know that Twitch remains focused on serving our streamers and ensuring that this is the best place to livestream for many years to come.&quot;
The included email confirms just over 500 people will lose their jobs. &quot;This will be a very hard day. Our service exists to empower communities to create, together, and every single one of you has played a vital role in fostering our community and furthering that mission,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Just a day after Unity announced it would be laying off 1,800 employees as part of an ongoing &quot;company reset&quot;, it&#x27;s being reported that live-streaming site Twitch is now poised to cut 35 percent of its workforce - equalling around 500 jobs - later this week.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Cecilia D&#x27;Anastasio, who, citing &quot;people familiar with the plans&quot;, reports the cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday.


While Twitch declined to comment on the story when approached by Bloomberg, the publication claims the job cuts come amid continuing struggles for the live-streaming site. According to Bloomberg&#x27;s sources, Twitch still remains unprofitable nine years after Amazon acquired the company for $970m.

                              <span>Palworld, the open-world survival and crafting adventure from developer Pocketpair that looks a lot like Pokémon with guns, is launching into early access on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass next Friday, 19th January.


Pocketpair describes Palworld as a &quot;monster-catching, survival and crafting game&quot; over on its Steam page, but notes it also features &quot;a variety of mechanics from other genres in order to provide a completely new experience for everyone.&quot; And while harmonious living alongside the Pals you catch (initially totalling over 100) is certainly possible - with the likes of idyllic farming, land and sea exploration, dungeon crawling, battling, building, and breeding all featured - it also looks to have a darker side too, and not just because of those guns.


Players that choose to take on the game&#x27;s ruthless poaching syndicate might, for example, find themselves traversing perilous climes where limited resources could mean they&#x27;re forced to eat their Pals. Meanwhile, Pals can be put to work making fire, generating electricity, or mining ore, or sent to a factory line where they can be made to automate different tasks - until they drop dead, that is. Then, there&#x27;s poaching, with players able to do crime, sneaking into wildlife sanctuaries to capture rare Pals that can be sold for cash.

                              <span>Arrowhead Game Studios has shared more information on the PC version of its satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 ahead of its PlayStation 5 and PC launch on 8th February, alongside confirmation of crossplay support between platforms.


Helldivers 2 follows the same basic template as its well-received predecessor (which earned a Eurogamer Recommended badge back in 2015), sending players - either working solo or in teams of up to four - on procedurally generated missions across hostile alien worlds to complete objectives, subjugate the locals, and orchestrate their escape. The likes of customisable loadouts and stratagems return in the sequel, but the major difference is a shift from a top-down perspective to third-person one this time around.


And now, Arrowhead has confirmed players across PlayStation 5 and PC will be able to experience all the above together, courtesy of Helldivers 2&#x27;s crossplay support. &quot;Community and teamwork are the most important pillars of Helldivers 2,&quot; it explained, &quot;and so it is essential to ensure players can work together regardless of the system they choose to use. Together we can celebrate victories, mourn losses, and liberate the galaxy without platform boundaries.&quot;

                              <span>It looks like the save bug that&#x27;s been causing headaches for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 players on Xbox since launch will soon be no more, with developer Larian announcing Microsoft has identified the cause and will be issuing a firmware fix next week.


Xbox fans rejoiced when Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 surprised-launched at the end of last year following an extended delay related to split-screen co-op, but things got off to a bumpy start, with some players soon reporting their saves were being lost after crashing - a frankly horrifying prospect for a title as lengthy and involved as Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.


Unfortunately, the issue has continued to persist in the weeks since; Larian recently offered a workaround to help players avoid the save issue, but noted that a permanent fix would require a firmware update from Microsoft, which was still in the works.

                              <span>HBO has cast the role of Abby for its second season of The Last of Us. 


As previously suspected, Kaitlyn Dever has secured the part. Dever was originally considered for the role of Ellie before the adaptation became a TV show, and the actress had aged out of consideration. 


The Booksmart and Dopesick actress will join Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie when filming begins next month. The show&#x27;s Abby is described as &quot;a skilled soldier whose black-and-white view of the world is challenged as she seeks vengeance for those she loved.&quot;

Burger King in Brazil is almost there, offering discounts in exchange for a facial scan. From a marketing video:
“At the end of the year, it’s Friday every day, and the hangover kicks in,” a vaguely robotic voice says as images of cheeseburgers glitch in and out over fake computer code. “BK presents Hangover Whopper, a technology that scans your hangover level and offers a discount on the ideal combo to help combat it.” The stunt runs until January 2nd...</span>

This free update is known as Sins of the Flesh, and is coming (no pun intended, but, hey, as it is there anyway let&#x27;s just roll with it) to platforms on 16th January.


Developer Massive Monster calls the upcoming content its &quot;biggest and most wicked&quot; update yet. It will include new progression systems, which will add more complexity to the gameplay. The Cult of the Lamb team also boasts about the arrival of &quot;shiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings,&quot; so plenty to keep an eye out for.

Wolfenstein developer MachineGames will showcase more than &quot;more than 10 minutes of game and developer insights&quot; including the first gameplay trailer.

                              <span>The forthcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will be a tribute to the late Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy.


That&#x27;s according to game director Axel Rydby who spoke to Eurogamer at a recent preview event at Rocksteady.


Indeed, the game includes a plaque in the Justice League base &quot;in loving memory&quot; of Conroy, along with a similar plaque for Arleen Sorkin who was the inspiration behind Harley Quinn.

                              <span>UPDATE 10/01/24: The Apex Legends crossover event with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is live, meaning the cost of event packs is now confirmed.
As per the official Instagram video shared previously, the cost of event packs is 100 coins - reduced from the standard 1000 coins. 
However, the cost of packs actually increases depending on the number of items owned, as per the screenshot below. If players own 16 to 35 items, the cost of packs increases back to 1000 coins. It means if players want to own all 36 items (including the death box), it won&#x27;t cost the full £360 but they&#x27;ll still need to shell out a considerable amount.

                              <span>Fans of Apex Legends are outraged at the cost of cosmetic items in the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth crossover event, that they fear will total over £300.


The event begins later today in celebration of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving next month, and includes a number of themed items, skins, and events. 


This is the first in-game crossover of its kind in Apex Legends and the potential cost of items is eye-watering for fans. On social media, the high cost has sparked fury in the game&#x27;s community, although this is based on the current cost of packs that could be reduced once the event launches.

Akka V-Arrh, as I am now dubbing it (it is still officially just called Akka Arrh), will be heading to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation set in March. A more specific date is yet to be announced.

The situation highlights the fact that if you do want to go watch the Pokémon series in order, you&#x27;ll need access to multiple streaming services and a couple of paid subscriptions.

In a message posted to Instagram, Jones said one fan had left multiple voicemails &quot;wanting to speak with me and requesting I call back&quot; on the answering machine of her workplace.


Jones said the behaviour was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and amounted to stalking.

During a segment hosted by Honda&#x27;s president Toshihiro Mibe talking about the car manufacturer&#x27;s work with Sony, the exec spoke about &quot;the joy of expanding life&#x27;s potential&quot;. 
Its vision expands beyond just your regular cars and motorcycles, with talk of the sky, ocean and outer space being shared. Sony&#x27;s technologies will help Honda expand its &quot;field of mobility&quot;, the company president explained.

Around five seconds of footage, including a behind-the-scenes motion capture shot, can be glimpsed in the video below - it shows a blonde-haired character leaping from a rooftop, then soaring down through the buildings of a floating city.


At the end of the clip, the character then flies towards what looks like a red, dragon-like beastie. All of this takes place in rather realistic-like surroundings - a far cry from the anime-inspired visuals of the original games. Intriguing!

                              <span>A The Last of Us spin-off TV series focusing on survivors Bill and Frank has been pitched.


The news comes from Nick Offerman, who recently won an Emmy for his portrayal of Bill in HBO&#x27;s series.


Speaking backstage after the awards, the actor was asked about whether viewers could see more from Bill and Frank in the future. &quot;Oh, great question but I would have to ask somebody with a higher pay grade than myself,&quot; he replied (thanks, Deadline).

                              <span>A The Last of Us spin-off TV series focusing on survivors Bill and Frank has been pitched.


The news comes from Nick Offerman, who recently won an Emmy for his portrayal of Bill in HBO&#x27;s series.


Speaking backstage after the awards, the actor was asked about whether viewers could see more from Bill and Frank in the future. &quot;Oh, great question but I would have to ask somebody with a higher pay grade than myself,&quot; he replied (thanks, Deadline).

                              <span>Unity has announced a further round of layoffs, less than two months after its previous job cuts, that&#x27;ll see it eliminate roughly 25 percent of its total workforce - around 1,800 employees - as part of the &quot;company reset&quot; it unveiled at the end of last year.


Unity confirmed additional layoffs at the company were &quot;likely&quot; back in November, when it revealed it was assessing its portfolio &quot;to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers&quot;. Shortly after, it announced it was ending its agreement with Weta FX, resulting in the loss of 265 jobs - the company&#x27;s fourth round of layoffs since the start of 2022.


A fresh round of layoffs at Unity - the largest ever at the company - has now been confirmed in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, around 1,800 employees will be affected, with the company saying the cuts come as it &quot;restructures and refocuses on its core business&quot; and seeks to &quot;position itself for long-term and profitable growth.&quot;

Shortly after it said affected parties should start seeing their bans lifted, and that &quot;Work is ongoing, and the Microsoft team is aware of the issue!&quot;.


A week on and Microsoft itself has now acknowledged the situation in a statement on social media. &quot;To provide clarity on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 mature content enforcement actions,&quot; it wrote, &quot;Xbox account suspensions are not automatic. Each clip is reviewed by a moderator and, if found in violation of our safety and content policies, actioned accordingly.&quot;

The second notable new feature is the ability to interrupt biometric operations on the device, like fingerprint and face unlock, by using the Accessibility service to force a fallback to PIN or password authentication.
The malware captures any PINs and passwords the victim enters to unlock their device and can later use them to unlock the device at will to perform malicious activities hidden from view.

Portal: Revolution was developed by Second Face Software in a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition, a community-made mod to help players create and play community content.
The developer estimates Revolution will take around eight hours to finish, and players will encounter a new laser cube variant and puzzles which use only the blue Portal Gun during the campaign.

Or is it a new character? For now, there&#x27;s no confirmation either way - but the video has certainly gotten fans speculating.

                              <span>UPDATE 9/1/24: Magic: The Gathering maker Wizards of the Coast has issued a statement saying it will work with external vendors to ensure AI-generated artwork is kept out of promotional material for the game. 
The statement follows the recent departure of an artist at the company, who said he had quit in protest at the promotional material.
&quot;Thanks to our diligent community who pointed out a series of recent marketing images may have included elements of generative AI, we are rethinking our process of how we work with vendors for our marketing creative,&quot; Wizards of the Coast wrote in a new statement.

                              <span>Artist Dave Rapoza has quit working for Wizards of the Coast following claims recent promotional material used for Magic: The Gathering was generated using AI tools.
Although Wizards of the Coast refuted accusations that a recent image was generated via AI, fans and artists alike were quick to point out inconsistencies with the image.
The charge is particularly emotive given Wizards of the Coast confirmed last month that it &quot;require[s] artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final Magic products&quot;.

                              <span>A remake of the original Metal Gear Solid game is reportedly still in development at Konami.
According to the Spanish website Areajugones – which previously, and correctly, leaked God of War Regnarök&#x27;s DLC existence ahead of a formal announcement – &quot;Konami is still working on a remake of the first installment, although right now Metal Gear Solid Delta is a priority in the studio&quot;.
The website reports that the claim comes from &quot;multiple sources&quot; and suggests that it will only be playable on PS5, not PS4. Similarly, there&#x27;s been no mention of a PC or Xbox release, either. Given Metal Gear Solid Delta is coming to multiple platforms, though, it stands to reason that the Metal Gear Solid Remake will, too. But all we can do is wait for official confirmation.

                              <span>A former Activision Blizzard executive has filed a discrimination claim with the company, alleging it of discriminating against &quot;old white guys&quot;.
As reported by Law360 and spotted by our sister site, GamesIndustry.biz, the complaint includes allegations against former CEO Bobby Kotick for remarks he made at an unspecified leadership conference in which he reportedly said that the &quot;problem&quot; at ABK was that &quot;there are too many old white guys&quot;.
The filing – lodged by a 57-year-old white man who worked at the company from 2014 until he was laid off as part of the company&#x27;s restructure in late 2023 – says that shortly after hearing these comments, a pair of white executives left &quot;based, at least in part, on Kotick&#x27;s ageist remarks&quot;, adding that &quot;Activision placed profits over people by terminating the older, higher-paid executives&quot;.

Developer Cloud Imperium Group&#x27;s latest Legatus DLC pack – always the game&#x27;s most controversial add-on – initially went on sale for an eye-watering £21K ($27K) five years ago. The latest, as spotted by Tweaktown, is currently on sale for £46,000 and includes everything in prior Legatus packs along with all the add-ons released since.
The website adds that Squadron 42 is &quot;currently under development&quot; and reminds players that Star Citizen is currently available in Alpha with &quot;additional features and updates&quot; released &quot;as they are developed&quot;.

                              <span>Star Citizen&#x27;s latest DLC pack costs almost £46,000 (€53K /$58K).
Developer Cloud Imperium Group&#x27;s latest Legatus DLC pack – always the game&#x27;s most controversial add-on – initially went on sale for an eye-watering £21K ($27K) five years ago. The latest, as spotted by Tweaktown, is currently on sale for £46,000 and includes everything in prior Legatus packs along with all the add-ons released since.
The website adds that Squadron 42 is &quot;currently under development&quot; and reminds players that Star Citizen is currently available in Alpha with &quot;additional features and updates&quot; released &quot;as they are developed&quot;.

According to Wall Street Journal (£), Netflix executives have had &quot;discussions&quot; about how to generate money from its games beyond subscription revenue, including microtransactions and ads, both of which the streaming giant has avoided up until now.
It appears Netflix would only serve advertisements to ad-supported subscribers, but is also considering offering &quot;sophisticated&quot; games for additional cost on top of the subscription fee.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.
And, yes, this is the eighteenth anniversary of Friday Squid Blogging. The first squid post is from January 6, 2006, and I have been posting them weekly since then. Never did I believe there would be so much to write about squid—but the links never seem to end.

To fully appreciate this tribute, we need to go back a few years. When Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 was still in early access, forum user Solfalia messaged Larian to thank the studio for releasing Act I, despite the game not being complete. This release allowed Solfalia to play the game - as it was at the time - with their father, who had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Their father had played other Larian games in the past and was a fan, so this opportunity meant a lot to them both.


&quot;This Early Access means that this Xmas I&#x27;ll be able to go on an adventure with him one last time, and I know he&#x27;ll enjoy it,&quot; Solfalia wrote in their original post from 2020.

In addition, there will be options that will allow players to customise the gameplay difficulty to a style that&#x27;s best for them.

Developer Larian shared an update on X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend, to state work is ongoing to sort these bans. The bans in question saw players being penalised for capturing in-game footage containing nudity, which was then uploaded to Xbox servers.
&quot;Microsoft team is aware of the issue,&quot; the developer said. &quot;If you&#x27;re wanting to upload any clips in the meantime, make sure to turn off mature content.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Larian is working alongside Microsoft to sort out &quot;annoying and uncool&quot; account bans, which can happen when Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 footage containing nudity gets uploaded to Xbox servers. 


This all stems back to the weekend, when Reddit user Daddy-Vegas warned other Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 players about capturing certain footage in Larian&#x27;s award-winning RPG. The Redditor recorded &quot;some naked camp time fun&quot;, which they planned to share with their brother. Xbox then automatically uploaded the footage to its servers. 


However, if Xbox discovers imagery it deems offensive, the content is removed and the player&#x27;s profile will be &quot;temporarily prohibited from sharing additional imagery (typically for 24 hours)&quot;. And, as Daddy-Vegas&#x27; clips included that aforementioned nudity, they were met with a ban for each clip, which resulted in their account being suspended for a year.

Konami&#x27;s Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 Remake both sit nestled among the likes of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

                              <span>We don’t have a useful quantum computer yet, but we do have quantum algorithms. Shor’s algorithm has the potential to factor large numbers faster than otherwise possible, which—if the run times are actually feasible—could break both the RSA and Diffie-Hellman public-key algorithms.
Now, computer scientist Oded Regev has a significant speed-up to Shor’s algorithm, at the cost of more storage.
Details are in this article. Here’s the result:
The improvement was profound. The number of elementary logical steps in the quantum part of Regev’s algorithm is proportional to ...</span>
