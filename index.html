                              <span>CD Projekt has shared little more information on its decision to &#x27;re-evaluate&#x27; the development of its The Witcher spin-off Project Sirus, saying it&#x27;s sometimes &quot;better to cut costs early&quot;.


Project Sirius was first outlined last October as part of CD Projekt&#x27;s ambitious studio roadmap, which included a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, a new IP, the next Witcher trilogy, a remake of the first Witcher game, and Project Sirius, a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio Molasses Flood.


Last week, however, CD Projekt announced its intention to write-off funds allotted to Project Sirius, saying it had re-evaluated the &quot;scope and commercial potential of the original concept&quot; and was now &quot;formulating a new framework&quot; better &quot;aligned with the [company&#x27;s] strategy&quot;.

                              <span>&quot;This was a difficult decision because of all the effort we and our partners put toward making this event happen, but we had to do what&#x27;s right for the industry and what&#x27;s right for E3,&quot; said Kyle Marsden-Kish, Reedpop&#x27;s Global VP of Gaming. 

&quot;We appreciate and understand that interested companies wouldn&#x27;t have playable demos ready and that resourcing challenges made being at E3 this summer an obstacle they couldn&#x27;t overcome. For those who did commit to E3 2023, we&#x27;re sorry we can&#x27;t put on the showcase you deserve and that you&#x27;ve come to expect from ReedPop&#x27;s event experiences.&quot;

A press release containing the statement concludes by noting ReedPop and the ESA will continue to work together on future E3 events.

                              <span>Shadows of Doubt, the wildly ambitious and long-in-development procedural detective noir from developer Cole Jefferies, is launching into Steam early access on 24th April.


Shadows of Doubt, which Jefferies first started discussing all the way back in April 2018, is a first-person, open-world detective sim - complete with the prerequisite snooping and stealth - set in a procedurally-generated noirish sci-fi city.


That procedural generation, which also incorporates elements of hand-crafted design, governs everything from the city&#x27;s streets and fully explorable buildings to the citizens milling around the world as determined by their personal schedules.

                              <span>Mask of the Rose, the &quot;marvellous romance with a hint of murder&quot; visual novel from Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies developer Failbetter Games, has been delayed a little longer and is now eyeing up an 8th June release on PC and Switch.


Mask of the Rose, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, takes place in 1862, shortly after the city of Fallen London (an alternate-universe version of Victorian London) is stolen by bats and carried to a vast underground cavern system deep beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface.


Here, in Mask of the Rose, players will need to pop on their investigatory hats as they attempt to solve the mystery of Fallen London&#x27;s first post-plunge murder and clear their housemate Archie&#x27;s name - a task that&#x27;ll see them exploring &quot;cosy, mysterious and magnificent&quot; locations, donning outfits, doing odd jobs to earn money and resources, and replaying the mystery to uncover &quot;deeper and deeper&quot; secrets.

                              <span>Now this is interesting:
Thousands of pages of secret documents reveal how Vulkan’s engineers have worked for Russian military and intelligence agencies to support hacking operations, train operatives before attacks on national infrastructure, spread disinformation and control sections of the internet.
The company’s work is linked to the federal security service or FSB, the domestic spy agency; the operational and intelligence divisions of the armed forces, known as the GOU and GRU; and the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence organisation.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley is poised to welcome a fresh set of four-legged friends next Wednesday, 5th April, as Simba and Nala take up residence as part of the village life sim&#x27;s previously announced The Lion King update.


Samba and Nala&#x27;s arrival brings Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s villager count up to 25, and comes alongside a new Lion-King-themed realm, additional and unspecified &quot;surprises&quot;, plus a new battle-pass-style Star Path with a fresh set of rewards.


As ever, the Star Path must first be purchased using Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s premium currency, whereupon players can set about completing challenges to unlock its various cosmetic rewards - this time inspired by Disney&#x27;s theme parks.

                              <span>D-Pad Studio, the developer behind acclaimed 2016 platform adventure Owlboy, is back with a 10th anniversary remaster of its debut title Savant - Ascent, which is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and mobile some time this &quot;summer&quot;.


Savant - Ascent, which D-Pad calls a &quot;shoot-em-up platformer&quot;, casts players as the Alchemist, a magical practitioner forced from their tower by a mysterious entity. The goal, then, is to return to the top by clearing stages consisting solely of two platforms - which players will need to carefully navigate as they fend off swarms of enemies using their projectiles.


Savant - Ascent is inspired by the music of Norweigian artist Savant, and its newly announced Anniversary Edition promises new stages, abilities, bosses, and power-ups, plus a new Survival Mode pitting players against a parade of bosses as they ride the Endless Elevator.

                              <span>While playing Resident Evil 4 Remake, I&#x27;ve found it enjoyable to look for traces of the original game and compare what&#x27;s been changed.
Which of Leon&#x27;s terrible lines made the script and which didn&#x27;t, for example, if the eggs are equipable, whether I&#x27;d get some goodies by shooting the lake...
But in recreating and reinventing its masterpiece, Capcom went even further back it seems, as players have spotted a reference to the fabled Resident Evil 3.5, an earlier version of RE4 which was in development but ultimately canned.

                              <span>Mario movie voice actor Chris Pratt says you should stick around after the film ends for a post-credit scene which hints at a potential sequel.


Without going into detail on what the scene might contain, Pratt did suggest that it was one direction a second Mario movie could continue in - if this one was a success. 


In a round of press interviews ahead of the film&#x27;s impending premiere, Pratt also spoke about the mixed response his casting had been given from some Nintendo fans - who Pratt described as &quot;passionate&quot;.

                              <span>Looking at Steam reviews is an odd little pastime of mine, and I&#x27;ve noticed some rather... peculiar reviews for Resident Evil 4 Remake.
At time of writing, the highest rated review says &quot;Shoot the lake water for a secret costume&quot;. There&#x27;s plenty of others too, promising items.
Now, if you&#x27;ve played the original or HD re-release of RE4, you&#x27;ll probably know what happens. Some poor unsuspecting newcomers to the game, however, might not.

All modes in Fortnite will now display a live player count figure - including Epic&#x27;s own main modes such as Battle Royale, Zero Build and Team Rumble. 


It&#x27;s an intriguing peek behind the scenes at how many people are playing Fortnite at any given moment, and another nudge from Epic to go try some of the many other experiences built by creators for the Fortnite platform.

                              <span>Sony is set to sell fewer than 300k PlayStation VR2 headsets in its first six weeks, a new report has claimed. 


Sales analysis published by Bloomberg has pegged the VR2&#x27;s sales total at around 270k units, as of the end of March. 


The publication previously reported that Sony had slashed the shipment forecast for its new VR headset, and expected to sell around 1m units at launch following underwhelming pre-order numbers.

                              <span>EA has announced a round of &quot;restructuring&quot; it says will likely impact around six percent of its workforce, potentially amounting to over 750 job losses based its latest employment figures.


In a letter to staff, later shared publicly on EA&#x27;s website, CEO Andrew Wilson announced the job cuts while simultaneously insisting the company was &quot;operating from a position of strength&quot;. 


&quot;As we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams,&quot; Wilson told workers at the company. &quot;These decisions are expected to impact approximately six percent of our company&#x27;s workforce.&quot;

                              <span>Minecraft is setting forth for adventure in the Forgotten Realms, as developer Mojang teams up with Wizards of the Coast for an official Dungeons &amp; Dragons DLC launching this &quot;spring&quot;.


The newly announced DLC - created in collaboration with developer Everbloom Games - takes players across five familiar Forgotten Realms locations, including Candlekeep and Icewind Dale, all reimagined in chunky block-o-vision, just as you&#x27;d expect in a Minecraft crossover.


The DLC, however, goes the extra mile and then some by introducing a fully voiced 10-hour story campaign enabling adventurers and their friends - playing as either barbarians, paladins, wizards, or rogues, complete with associated abilities - to take on familiar D&amp;D enemies including beholders, mimics, mindflayers, and, yes, dragons.

                              <span>Wildfrost, the card-battling roguelike from Caveblazers studio Deadpan Games and artist Gaziter, now has a released date, and will be hitting the deck on Switch and PC on 12th April.


Wildfrost sends brave adventurers on a perilous journey through monster-infested tundra and icy mountains as they battle to reach the mysterious Sun Temple and save the town of Snowdwell from an everlasting winter - a quest that&#x27;ll require &quot;determination, sharp strategy and deck-building skills&quot;, according to its developer.


Stats and skills are randomised at the start of a run once players have selected their preferred Leader, and, along the way, there&#x27;ll be companions to rescue and recruit, elemental treasures to unearth, merchants only too willing to flog their wares to weary adventurers, plus &quot;wondrous wobbly charms&quot; - with each decision contributing to a battle deck that&#x27;s unique to a run.

Admission control is an important part of the Kubernetes control plane, with several internal
features depending on the ability to approve or change an API object as it is submitted to the
server. It is also useful for an administrator to be able to define business logic, or policies,
regarding what objects can be admitted into a cluster. To better support that use case, Kubernetes
introduced external admission control in
v1.7.
In addition to countless custom, internal implementations, many open source projects and commercial
solutions implement admission controllers with user-specified policy, including
Kyverno and Open Policy Agent’s
Gatekeeper.
While admission controllers for policy have seen adoption, there are blockers for their widespr…</span>

The delay news comes just weeks after Deck13 confirmed a 16th May release for Atlas Fallen, with the studio now saying it&#x27;s pushing that launch back to August in order to &quot;deliver the best possible version&quot; of the game.


&quot;Our goals has always been to create a memorable action-RPG experience in a unique setting, with exciting gameplay and the option for fully playable seamless co-op with a friend,&quot; the developer explained in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We&#x27;d love to give the game some extra time which will allow us to deliver the best possible version of Atlas Fallen.&quot;

                              <span>Forspoken might not have particularly dazzled on release, but anyone eager for more will have their wish granted - publisher Square Enix has now revealed - on 26th May, when the beleaguered action-RPG&#x27;s previously announced prequel DLC, In Tanta We Trust, arrives.


In Tanta We Trust&#x27;s action takes place 25 years before the events of the main game, after protagonist Frey is catapulted back in time to the Purge of the Rheddig - the battle that devastated the land of Athia and drove the Tantas, its corrupted matriachs, to madness. 


The DLC&#x27;s ensuing quest to save Athia promises a new set of magical abilities for Frey, new companion Tanta Cinta, and &quot;unique, vertically-designed&quot; environments to explore.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard&#x27;s acrimonious breakup with Chinese publisher NetEase was affected by boss Bobby Kotick feeling &quot;threatened&quot;, the New York Times has reported. 


Specifically, Kotick believed NetEase boss Ding Lei had suggested his company could sway the Chinese government&#x27;s decision over whether to pass Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard in the country. 


But this threat was simply a misunderstanding by Kotick, according to a number of New York Times sources familiar with a crucial Zoom call between the two company leaders via the use of translators.

Last week, Bloober Team president Pitor Babieno spoke with Polish site Bankier.pl, which reported the game was &quot;technically ready&quot;.


Bloober has now stated this was mistranslated and taken out of context, before clarifying it has not yet announced a release date.

                              <span>Japan&#x27;s JFTC has approved Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn takeover of Activision Blizzard.


In a press release on its website, the JFTC &quot;reviewed the transaction and reached the conclusion that the transaction is unlikely to result in substantially restraining competition in any particular fields of trade. Accordingly, the JFTC has notified the Parties that the JFTC will not issue a cease and desist order, resulting in the completion of its review.&quot;



Japan joins the likes of Brazil and Saudi Arabia to approve the merger, while the deal remains under review across the world.

In a bid to prevent Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn takeover of Activision Blizzard, Sony has claimed the deal would be anti-competitive and even stated Microsoft could release a deliberately buggy version of Call of Duty on PlayStation.


Kotick directly addresses these statements in his email.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has shown off Jun Kazama gameplay from Tekken 8.


This is a big moment for Tekken fans: Jun made her debut in 1995&#x27;s Tekken 2 and hasn&#x27;t been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 28 years later, she&#x27;s back and it looks like she hasn&#x27;t aged a day. Tekken time logic!


The footage kicks off with Jun fighting her own son, Jin, but the highlight is Jun&#x27;s long-awaited encounter with Jin&#x27;s dad, Kazuya Mishima. It&#x27;s all a bit Jerry Springer.

                              <span>The wait is finally over for PC players eager to get stuck into Naughty Dog&#x27;s acclaimed The Last of Us Part 1, but things haven&#x27;t got off to a great start for Sony&#x27;s latest PC port, which currently has a &quot;mostly negative&quot; rating on Steam.


The Last of Us Part 1 - Naughty Dog&#x27;s new-gen spruce-up of the acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror - initially launched for PlayStation 5 last September, and its long-promised PC port finally arrived earlier today following a 25-day delay designed to ensure, as Naughty Dog put it last month, its &quot;PC debut is in the best shape possible.&quot;


Unfortunately, early word from PC players on Steam is that The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s &quot;best shape&quot; is nowhere near good enough, with Steam reviews (reflected in similar reports on The Last of Us subreddit) pointing to a host of technical issues, including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - even on high-end hardware.

                              <span>Developer Volition has shared a new post-launch roadmap for its beleaguered Saints Row reboot, detailing some of the free and paid content coming before the end of August.


Volition&#x27;s newly released roadmap marks the first time the studio has discussed additional content for the reboot since last October when, following a particularly bug-riddled launch, it announced it would initially be prioritising &quot;improvements over new features&quot;.


Now though, having released a number of significant patches to address Saints Row&#x27;s most pressing issues in the months since its launch last August, Volition is ready to talk new stuff, starting with a free Dead Island 2 cosmetics pack this April.

                              <span>Nintendo has released 10 minutes of new footage for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, showing off new abilities, enemies and the sky islands.


In a special gameplay video, we get to see Link use a new Recall ability, that allows him to rewind time. Link uses this to ride a rock that had fallen from the sky back up to where it came from. Here, he then glides on to one of Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s sky islands, where he comes across new enemies known as &quot;constructs&quot;. 


This trailer also gives us a look at the new weapon fusing mechanic. Link can add keese eyeballs to arrows to make homing arrows, and mushrooms to shields (yes, mushrooms to shields). When the shroom shield is struck by an advancing enemy, the mushroom creates a cloud of spores that engulfs the fight in a fog. This fusing technique can also be used to make vehicles like rafts from stray logs and fans, or even flying ships, thanks to the Ultrahand ability.

                              <span>Developers have spoken about the &quot;morally and physically exhausting&quot; crunch culture at Ubisoft Paris. 


In a report by NME focused primarily on the development of Just Dance 2023, members of the Solidaires Informatique union group for Ubisoft Paris said pre-production for the game was a &quot;mess&quot;. 


Reportedly, the Just Dance 2023 team was &quot;tasked with changing the Just Dance 2023 engine just 11 months before launch&quot;, while bosses continued to push ideas &quot;that had to be considered at all costs&quot;. This was despite developers saying they were &quot;already underwater&quot; at this point.

&quot;We have stopped our previous introductory offer for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass and are evaluating different marketing promotions for new members in the future,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson told Eurogamer.

                              <span>Intercept Games has shared an update on its second patch for Kerbal Space Program 2.


Kerbal Space Program 2, which released in early access in February, received its first (extensive) patch earlier this month. This followed a rather rocky launch for the space-flight simulator, which saw a steep fall in player numbers soon after release, with many asking for refunds due to the game&#x27;s buggy state.


Now, the KSP2 team is working on another patch, with creative director Nate Simpson noting that while it&#x27;ll be &quot;tough to beat the sheer number of fixes that went into Patch One&quot;, players can still expect &quot;a few big ones&quot; to arrive in Patch Two.

                              <span>A dataminer of Resident Evil 4 Remake has discovered a reference to Separate Ways, suggesting more DLC may be on the way soon.


As shared on Twitter by Resident Evil Central, dataminer Gosetsu found a folder named The Another Order within the game&#x27;s files, alongside files for the Chainsaw demo and the Mercenaries mode.


The Another Order was the name of the extra game mode in the original game in Japan, what we in the west called Separate Ways.

                              <span>Ironmace, the Korean developer behind upcoming looter Dark and Darker, has used ChatGPT to try and prove it hasn&#x27;t infringed any copyright claims. This follows an accusation from Nexon, another Korean developer and one which several Ironmace employees used to work for, which claimed its game (P3) was used as a prototype for Dark and Darker.


Over the weekend, Ironmace stated it had been served a cease and desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon, something the developer said is &quot;based on distorted claims&quot;. As a result, Dark and Darker was removed from Steam.


At this time, Ironamce asked for &quot;understanding&quot; as it worked to get the game back on the site, noting that &quot;due to the sensitive legal nature of this issue&quot; it has to be &quot;careful with [its] statements so as to not jeopardise [its] position&quot;.

&quot;Armed with a specially modified camera to capture a target&#x27;s likeness and cosplay as them, Hero-Ki can use his penchant for disguise to evade threats and exploit the environment in Hyenas, as only the sharpest-eyed rival will be able to detect the clues that reveal him as an imposter,&quot; Sega teases.

The first to fall was Adobe Reader in the enterprise applications category after Haboob SA’s Abdul Aziz Hariri (@abdhariri) used an exploit chain targeting a 6-bug logic chain abusing multiple failed patches which escaped the sandbox and bypassed a banned API list on macOS to earn $50,000...</span>

                              <span>It looks like Dead Cells is getting a native PS5 release that bundles in its Return to Castlevania DLC.

Whilst not formally confirmed, the game – called Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania Edition, unsurprisingly enough – popped up on the US Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), clearly marked as coming to PS5 (thanks, Gematsu).

Right now, we&#x27;re unclear if it&#x27;s a digital release or if we&#x27;ll get a physical version, too, but it&#x27;ll be good news nonetheless for PlayStation 5 owners who want to experience a native Dead Cells adventure, rather than via the backwards-compatible PS4 version which released five years ago.

                              <span>Action-RPG Duel Corp is now available in early access (EA) on Steam.

The game – which boasts the curious conceit that you can play alone and then later with a friend – launched in early access yesterday, and will be available as an open playtest between now and 4th April.

Like other games released in EA, the two-person development team says the plan is to &quot;make sure that Duel Corp turns into a well-rounded product for full release&quot; when &quot;it&#x27;s the complete experience we want it to be&quot;. Consequently, the team believes the game will be in early access &quot;for about one year&quot;.

The conference - self-described as &quot;the game industry&#x27;s premiere professional event, championing game developers and the advancement of their craft&quot; – ran between 20th and 24th March in San Francisco, California. As the event drew to a close, however, attendees began sharing concerning stories about their experiences at the event.

&quot;Women at GDC this year have been belittled and undermined in their roles, been hit on relentlessly, and had their drinks spiked by predatory men,&quot; tweeted developer Leena van Deventer (thanks, TheGamer).

That adds up to a staggering 16.3 billion hours played across PC and consoles by players living in 242 different countries.

&quot;The PUBG community has expanded and changed over the past six years, resulting in priceless memories, thrilling updates, and amazing gameplay experiences - with many more still to come,&quot; publisher Krafton said, confirming that the shooter generated 75 million sales before the game went free-to-play.

Gran Turismo producer, Kazunori Yamauchi, confirmed they were coming in a cheeky tweet that showed the five vehicles in deep shadow, telling us only that the update was coming &quot;next week&quot;, and reminding us that it&#x27;s &quot;cherry blossom season in Tokyo&quot;.

As is usually the case, fans have already forensically examined the teaser image, and reckon it includes the new Mazda 3, and possibly a Panamera Sport Turismo or an Audi RS5 DTM.

                              <span>The term &quot;Left4Dead3&quot; has reportedly popped up in CS2 files.

Dubbed &quot;version 2&quot;, the reference secreted in the files states that whilst the severity of Left4Dead3 is &quot;high&quot; – whatever that means – the priority is &quot;none&quot;, which comes as no surprise to many of the commenters on Steam&#x27;s subreddit page.

Whispers of a new Left 4 Dead title have been heard from several sources for several years now. Back in December 2019, Valve News Network&#x27;s well-connected Tyler McVicker told Twitter followers that &quot;Left 4 Dead VR is real&quot;, while in January 2020, Chinese HTC president Alvin Wang Graylin shared slides from a VR presentation making mention of Left 4 Dead 3.

                              <span>Spoiler warning for God of War Ragnarok&#x27;s late-game story!


With much of the final, climactic level in place and the last few visual effects coming in, the developers at Sony Santa Monica realised they had a bit of a problem: there&#x27;s a big plot development that happens here, essential to the entire story of God of War Ragnarok - but nobody who played the game would notice it.


The moment in question here is Atreus&#x27; big realisation, that bringing about Ragnarok is, after all, maybe not the best idea - something he notices when dwarven companion Sindri sets off a kind of magical shockwave, which destroys the Asgardian villains&#x27; defences but, also, takes out a good few innocent civilians, too.

                              <span>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has smashed its all-time concurrent PC user peak. Yes, again.

Clocking up a record 1.5 million concurrent players earlier today (thanks, SteamDB), that means CS:GO now sports Steam&#x27;s second-biggest concurrent players record ever.

Whilst it still has some ways to go to take the top spot – pole position holder PUBG Battlegrounds&#x27; concurrent record is twice as high at CS:GO&#x27;s at 3.2 million – it&#x27;s an incredible feat for a decade-old shooter.

The settlement dismisses the claims levied against him &quot;with prejudice&quot;, &quot;pursuant to a confidential settlement&quot;. Avellone claims the settlement includes a &quot;seven-figure payment&quot;, which includes &quot;the return&quot; of his legal fees.

                              <span>Fan-favourite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, is getting a video game adaptation.

Paramount Global senior VP Doug Rosen confirmed to Polygon that the third-person action-RPG adaptation will be &quot;a darker, more mature take&quot; on the TMNT IP, reportedly likening the game to Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War games. 

According to Rosen, the game will follow a single Turtle – in the comic, it&#x27;s Michaelangelo – although it may be possible to play as others, including perhaps other notable characters like April and Splinter, in flashbacks.

                              <span>Dark and Darker has been removed from Steam after developer Ironmace received a cease and desist demand from Korean publisher Nexon.

Fans first noticed changes being made to the RPG&#x27;s Steam store page overnight, when assets like videos and screenshots were quietly removed. Then they realised that online co-op and PvP had stopped working, followed by the complete removal of all traces of the game. Now, if you attempt to load the game&#x27;s Steam store, it&#x27;ll take you to Steam&#x27;s front page.

&quot;To all our fans, we have recently been served a cease and desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon regarding Dark and Darker based on distorted claims,&quot; Ironmace explained via the community&#x27;s Discord server (thanks, Reddit).

                              <span>If you played Wordle religiously through 2022, you might remember one particularly rough day&#x27;s answer: Parer.


This turned out to be the most difficult word of the year, in part thanks to its use of a recurring &#x27;r&#x27;, but a GDC talk yesterday from Zoe Bell, the New York Times&#x27; executive producer of games, revealed it broke a particularly whopping amount of streaks.


Typically, Bell explained, showing a chart that tracked players&#x27; streak breaks over time, &quot;15 percent of people break their streak on a given day - except that one day, with &#x27;parer&#x27;, where almost 60 percent of people broke their streak.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo fans, this is your final reminder that the Wii U and 3DS eShop stores will close on Monday 27th March.


That means this weekend is your last chance to buy any games exclusive to those systems.


Nintendo confirmed the date back in July last year, but it&#x27;s been quite some time since then.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a video showing off Jack-8 in Tekken 8.


The hard-hitting Tekken AI returns in the upcoming fighting game with what looks like a stance ability and new voice work - and by that I mean he grunts and snarls as he smashes up his opponent.


I love Jack&#x27;s new rage art, which sees him fire a huge railgun point blank into his opponent&#x27;s face. Oh, and stick to the end for a surprise stare from Jack with the visor. Truly terrifying stuff.

Speaking to DiscussingFilm, the director was asked how he was planning to approach the adaptation of Sucker Punch&#x27;s samurai epic.


&quot;Ghost of Tsushima is a really interesting story if you really dive into the tale of Jin Sakai and what the film is really about. And you tie him to these amazing visuals,&quot; Stahelski replied.

                              <span>Blizzard is investigating reports from some players that the Diablo 4 beta is causing GPU issues.


The reports revolve around GPUs apparently overheating while running the action RPG&#x27;s recent early access on PC.


Eurogamer reader &quot;jonzie23&quot; was among those who reported a problem with their GPU while running Diablo 4 last weekend.

                              <span>The Resident Evil 4 Remake released today, and it is already doing some impressive numbers on Steam. In fact, it has set the all-time concurrent players peak record for the Resident Evil franchise as a whole.


At the time of writing, there are 131,159 players working their way through the world as Leon S. Kennedy (and his lovely jacket), with that number more than likely to rise as the day goes on.


To put those numbers into more perspective, Resident Evil Village has an all-time player peak of 106,631. Then in third place, we have the Resident Evil 2 Remake with an all-time player peak of 74,227.

                              <span>There have been many advertising beats for the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. We have seen trailers of Mario getting launched unceremoniously through a pipe and out into the Mushroom Kingdom. We have seen an eclectic take on Rainbow Road. We have even had a plumbing commercial full of Nintendo Easter eggs. 


Now, if all that chaos has made you a tad hot under the collar and in need of a refreshing wash, well you are in luck. That&#x27;s right, cosmetic company Lush has partnered with the Super Mario Bros. Movie to produce some themed products. 


If you head over to the Lush website, you can pick and choose from a limited-edition range of Super Mario Bros. products that will &quot;power-up your bathing&quot;.

In addition to this, HoYoverse revealed the game is also in development for PlayStation, although we don&#x27;t have a release date for this platform (as in console platform) as yet.


For those currently unfamiliar with Honkai: Star Rail, it is an upcoming space fantasy RPG that promises players a journey through &quot;immense worlds of the unknown&quot;.

Yes, that&#x27;s right. Unlike in the original Resi 4 release, the remake&#x27;s merchant is an indestructible force, and just cannot be killed. 


Back in the day, some players (naming no names) would shoot and slice at Resi 4&#x27;s cloaked salesman. However, this time around, I guess Capcom didn&#x27;t want the same fate to befall its enigmatic character any more.

&quot;My long-term view of this deal has always been that it would complete but with further concessions from Microsoft to smooth the process,&quot; Ampere Analysis&#x27; Piers Harding-Rolls said.
&quot;However, the provisional Phase 2 findings of the CMA did give me pause for thought considering the structural remedies proposed. Today&#x27;s updated findings swings the pendulum back in favour of the deal completing.

The new mode launched this week alongside an unveiling of the advancements in Unreal Engine 5 that power it. Of course, the first thing fans did with all that power and creativity was recreate old Fortnite maps.



That, however, is technically against Epic&#x27;s terms and conditions, as recreating copyrighted intellectual property is forbidden.

Reddick, who portrays Commander Zavala in Destiny, tragically passed away at the age of 60 last Friday. Since then, many Destiny players have chosen to pay their respects to Reddick by gathering alongside Zavala at the Tower.


Now, in a new This Week at Bungie blog post, the game&#x27;s developer has shared a touching tribute to Reddick, thanking the actor for his work on the series, while also confirming more &quot;performances yet to come&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft has responded to claims it pulled games from PlayStation, following reports it didn&#x27;t want Bethesda&#x27;s Redfall on PS5.


Redfall game designer Harvey Smith told IGN France that after Bethesda&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft, its stance was &quot;no PlayStation 5&quot;. There&#x27;s no indication if a PS5 version was in development or just a suggestion.



Now Microsoft has responded, stating &quot;we haven&#x27;t pulled any games from PlayStation&quot; and that it has in fact &quot;expanded our footprint of games&quot; after releasing PS5 exclusives Deathloop and Ghostwire: Tokyo on Xbox.

                              <span>Psychological thriller Fort Solis is heading to PlayStation 5, as well as PC, this summer. In addition to this news, we also have a brand-new trailer for Fallen Leaf&#x27;s upcoming space horror, which stars Red Dead Redemption 2&#x27;s Roger Clark and The Last of Us&#x27; Troy Baker. 


Clark plays Jack Leary, an engineer who responds to a maintenance request on an isolated mining base on Mars. 


&quot;With storm warnings imminent [Leary] heads inside to make contact. As the night grows longer, events escalate, spiral out of control and the mystery of what happened to the crew begins to reveal itself. The storms arrive, limiting Jack&#x27;s escape as he looks to hold out until morning arrives,&quot; reads Fort Solis&#x27; game description on Steam. You can check out its latest trailer below.

The news arrives with a change of producer, as Akihiko Matsui will be succeeded by Yoji Fujito. 


In a blog post on Play Online from both producers, Matsui thanked fans and colleagues alike for their support. He&#x27;s worked on the game from the start and was promoted to producer in 2012.

                              <span>Valve has warned players of Counter-Strike 2 scams with fake access to its Limited Test.


After plenty of speculation, Counter-Strike 2 was officially announced on Wednesday and will arrive this summer. Before then, a Limited Test is now available for some CS:GO players through an in-game invite.


However, reports have arisen of fake login pages, as shared on reddit, which harvest data and allow scammers to steal Steam account details.

&quot;Please be patient with us as we expect a lot of players joining to help test our game and infrastructure. Thank you for helping us make Diablo 4 the best it can be!&quot;

The release date for the free DLC was revealed as part of the Resident Evil 4 remake launch trailer, below.


The Mercenaries is a long-running Resident Evil challenge mode that sees players attempt to defeat as many enemies as they can before the timer runs out - or you die. In the original Resident Evil 4, Mercenaries mode was unlocked upon completing the main game.

                              <span>Park Beyond - Tropico developer Limbic Entertainment&#x27;s physics-defying theme park management sim - has a release date and will be bringing a dash of impossification to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 16th June.


On a basic level, Park Beyond delivers pretty much everything you&#x27;d expect from a theme park management sim, asking players to plop down rides, set up shops, hire employees, and slap down scenery in a bid to create the most appealing - and lucrative - tourist attraction they can.


The twist, though, is &quot;impossification&quot;, which lets players create ludicrous, gravity defying rides reminiscent of Till Nowak&#x27;s wonderful short The Centrifuge Brain Project - perhaps unlocking a version of the classic pirate ship swing ride capable of splitting into three independently looping segments, or rollercoasters that can fling cars across gaps using cannons.

Additionally, the developer has added new the Grimstalker Kemono variant in a smaller update launching today.


Omega Force previously teased a big Wild Hearts update as part of the game&#x27;s post-launch roadmap earlier this month, but now the developer has slapped it with a 6th April release date, and provided more details on what it&#x27;ll bring.


First up is Murakumo, the aforementioned fox-inspired Kemono with the power to manipulate petals (and also the first brand-new Kemono to join Wild Hearts since launch), which drops materials needed to craft a selection of new weapons and armour sets. Additionally, it brings a new Spinning Top Kakuri, the first new Karakuri to be introduced to the base game.

                              <span>Developer Frogwares has shared a new Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened trailer, highlighting an expanded role for Watson in the remake of its Lovecraft-inspired 2007 original.


Frogwares&#x27; ground-up reimagining of The Awakened - which comes to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC next month - retools the original&#x27;s story of Cthulhu cults and eldritch abominations into a continuation of the young Sherlock arc started in 2021&#x27;s Chapter One.


While Sherlock&#x27;s updated plunge into cosmic horror still whisks him around the globe - from the smoggy streets of Victorian London to the bayous of New Orleans - Frogwares&#x27; remake places a new focus on his relationship with Watson.

                              <span>Planet Zoo&#x27;s slow, steady quest to have all the animals continues on 4th April with the arrival of the management sim&#x27;s latest paid expansion, the Tropical Pack.


As its name suggests, the Tropical Pack - which will be Planet Zoo&#x27;s 13th paid DLC expansion - is all about the rainforest, and introduces a total of five new animals. There&#x27;s the Lar Gibbon, the Red River Hog, the Asian Water Monitor, the Fossa, and finally, the Brown-Throated Sloth - which arrives as a Walkthrough Exhibit addition.


Alongside its critters, Planet Zoo&#x27;s Tropical Pack brings 200 new scenery pieces inspired by Southeast Asia, enabling players to construct everything from Tongkonan villages to Balinese temples. New tropical flora, meanwhile, includes the Rafflesia (better known as the corpse flower) and the carnivorous Attenborough’s Pitcher Plant.

                              <span>C-Smash VRS - the PSVR2 update of Sega&#x27;s cult 2001 arcade and Dreamcast game Cosmic Smash - now has a demo on the PlayStation Store ahead of its 23rd June release.


The original Cosmic Smash offered something like a futuristic blend of Breakout and squash, challenging players to use a ball and racquet to clear blocks at the end of a long room within a time limit, with each &quot;stop&quot; on its subway-style map offering up a new challenge.


C-Smash VRS takes that same basic premise and gives it a VR twist, promising &quot;intuitive controls, finger detection, 3D audio, and haptics&quot;, alongside solo play, a variety of online versus and co-op modes, plus a dynamic synth soundtrack from Danalogue and Rez Infinite&#x27;s DJ Ken Ishii.

                              <span>Keanu Reeves&#x27; &quot;star power&quot; gave him such a draw that CD Projekt Red had to make his Cyberpunk 2077 character, Johnny Silverhand, especially &quot;horrible&quot; at first just so player&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t constantly side with him in quest choices.


That&#x27;s according to Paweł Sasko, who was lead quest designer on The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, and is now CDPR&#x27;s quest director for the upcoming Phantom Liberty expansion. Sasko was speaking at his GDC talk on Wednesday, where he suggested it&#x27;s a similar situation for Idris Elba, who stars in the DLC.


&quot;When it comes to Cyberpunk,&quot; he said, &quot;we discovered this very interesting factor which is star power. We had Keanu Reeves playing Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077 - and Idris Elba in Phantom Liberty - and so we had to take into account the fact that every time we had a star, players were going to fall for a star almost all the time.

In the port city of Guayaquil, journalist Lenin Artieda of the Ecuavisa private TV station received an envelope containing a pen drive which exploded when he inserted it into a computer, his employer said.
Artieda sustained slight injuries to one hand and his face, said police official Xavier Chango. No one else was hurt.
Chango said the USB drive sent to Artieda could have been loaded with RDX, a military-type explosive.

According to police official Xavier Chango, the flash drive that went off had a 5-volt explosive charge and is thought to have used RDX. Also known as T4, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (...</span>

                              <span>Prepare for a darker take on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in a video game version of well-regarded comic book The Last Ronin. 


As reported by Polygon, this game will be a third-person action role-playing game in the style of God of War, with the last surviving Turtles member as its hero. 


The Last Ronin tells a markedly different Turtles tale from usual. It&#x27;s set in a grim future where three of the four superhero turtles are dead, alongside Master Splinter. The remaining Turtle - whose identity is only revealed at the end of the book - acts as a lone avenger, taking down The Foot Clan across New York City.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the bleeding-edge technologies on show this week at GDC 2023 - from Epic Games&#x27; eye-popping Unreal Engine to Ubisoft&#x27;s intriguing new Ghostwriter dialogue tool.

Last night&#x27;s startling State of Unreal presentation by Epic revealed a swathe of new features coming to the company&#x27;s suite of game development tools - such as photo-realistic procedural generation on a massive scale, and the ability to translate iPhone video footage into pretty slick performance capture. Earlier this week, Ubisoft also showed off Ghostwriter, an &quot;AI&quot;-driven tool to suggest script lines for use in background dialogue.
But are these advancements the future of video game development, or are they an encroachment by AI into the kinds of work previously the domain of human writers and animators? Or both? Joining me to discuss all that are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>An upcoming tech preview for CD Projekt Red&#x27;s Cyberpunk 2077 will show us the power of path-tracing. Move over ray- tracing, there is a new kid on Cyberpunk&#x27;s block. 


Path-tracing, which is also known as full ray-tracing, has been used in computer-generated imagery for films and TV for a while now, with notable examples including some Pixar animations. It &quot;accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene&quot;, making things even more realistic. 


Now, this tech is coming to Cyberpunk 2077 on 11th April, in the game&#x27;s Ray-tracing: Overdrive Mode.

You can check out the trailer below to see Amy in action and more. I&#x27;m personally excited to play the Game Gear games - their Master System equivalents were my introduction to Sonic and gaming all those years ago!
The expansion will cost £7.99 in the UK, or £34.99 for the whole package.

                              <span>The Lords of the Fallen is now going to be known as Lords of the Fallen, and we just got a fresh look at the upcoming dark fantasy RPG thanks to last night&#x27;s State of Unreal technical showcase.


As you may have guessed given where this latest footage comes from, Lords of the Fallen will run on Unreal Engine 5. Developer Hexworks explained the goal has &quot;always been to create the most immersive game experience possible&quot;, and Unreal Engine 5 will help make this a reality. 


And, I have to say, what has been shown so far certainly does look impressive. In the words of Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale: &quot;This is how fans wanted Elden Ring to look&quot;.

Publisher 2K has also now unveiled the game&#x27;s three editions, including the eye-popping £100 Lego 2K Drive Awesome Rivals Edition, which costs $120/€120 elsewhere.


This version includes the game&#x27;s Year 1 Drive Pass, which adds a new biome to explore, plus &quot;four individual post-launch seasons of Drive Pass content, each with new vehicles and themes&quot;. In addition to that, there&#x27;s multiple new vehicles, a vehicle flair, and in-game Lego minifigures.

                              <span>Square Enix has begun sharing short videos of Final Fantasy 16 to tease more gameplay, but one in particular has sparked debate.


As posted on the Japanese Twitter account for the game, a short video was shared on 21st March showing off more footage of Torgal the dog in battle, flipping an enemy into the air ready for Clive to juggle. Earlier today another video of Torgal was shown, proving you can indeed pet the dog.


But it&#x27;s the video from 22nd March that&#x27;s got fans in a spin. The clip is set in a forest area and shows - shock horror - Clive shimmying through a gap from one area to the next.

Atari additionally noted there will be an earn-out of up to $10m, payable in cash over the next three years based on the future performance of Nightdive.

                              <span>Justin Roiland, co-creator of Rick and Morty and founder of High on Life developer Squanch Games, has finally spoken publicly about the allegations of domestic abuse which surfaced earlier this year. 


The allegations led Roiland to resign from High on Life developer Squanch Games. Rick and Morty&#x27;s US network Adult Swim also cut ties, and said the series would continue without Roiland attached.


At the time, Roiland pled not guilty to charges of battery and false imprisonment, filed by a former partner.

Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s Feathered Species Pack, as the DLC is known, is another strictly creature-focused expansion, adding a total of four news dinos: bipedal &quot;feathered tyrant&quot; Yutyrannus, flying Jeholopterus, omnivorous Deinocheirus, and pack-hunting Sinosauropteryx.


Those four additions will cost £5.99/€7.99/$7.99 USD when Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s Feathered Species Pack - the game&#x27;s fourth paid DLC since launch - arrives next week on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

Developed by Tindalos Interactive, Aliens: Dark Descent is a &quot;squad-based, single-player action game&quot; that pits players against Xenomorphs, human Weyland-Yutani Corporation operatives, and previously unseen threats as they explore the large, open levels of the USS Otago - requiring them to command their team of Marines in real-time to stay alive.


Squads are assembled from five starting classes - with Tindalos promising &quot;dozens of specializations, unique abilities, and weapons&quot; to customise them further - with players needing to keep track of their soldiers&#x27; health, resources, and sanity along the way.

                              <span>Epic Games has held its latest State of Unreal presentation, during which it demoed new features for Unreal Engine 5.2, fresh peeks at Unreal Engine games such as NCSoft&#x27;s Project M and Ninja Theory&#x27;s Hellblade sequel, plus a live demo of Fortnite&#x27;s brand new UE5-powered creative mode.


Oh, and Tim Sweeney gave his thoughts on the concept of an &quot;open metaverse&quot;, which he predicted would arrive in the next decade. 


Today&#x27;s presentation began with a look at new procedural generation technology being baked into UE 5.2, which will allow developers to build a small section of an open-world environment, from which Unreal Engine can then build out a much larger area at scale. A demo video showed how components can be switched out on the fly, with elements such as a bridge adapting automatically to the environment around.

That&#x27;s according to Redfall game designer Harvey Smith, who, in conversation with IGN France, said Microsoft&#x27;s stance on Redfall&#x27;s development was &quot;no PlayStation 5&quot; after the takeover.


&quot;We were acquired by Microsoft and it was a change with [a] capital C,&quot; Smith told the website during a recent press event (via Google Translate). &quot;They came in and they said &#x27;No PlayStation 5, we&#x27;re focusing on Xbox, PC and the Game Pass&#x27;.&quot;

                              <span>Redfall developer Arkane is &quot;working actively&quot; to remove the game&#x27;s always-online requirement when playing strictly in single-player mode. 


The vampire shooter&#x27;s always-online restriction raised eyebrows when it was spotted last month. 


Now, speaking to Eurogamer, game director Harvey Smith has revealed his team are now working to change how the game worked to make offline single-player possible.

Admittedly, Shredder is not exactly known for his use of guns, with the leader of the Foot Clan generally preferring his metal blades over firearms. 
However, here he is suited and booted, with a rather deft use of a rifle, and ready to take on any Operator &quot;who stands in his way of victory&quot; (although, doesn&#x27;t he keep getting one-upped by four turtles? Hmm, maybe he will have better luck here).

A retail version will then follow in the summer: on 9th June in Europe and 20th June 2023 in North America, to be precise.


In Miasma Chronicles, players will take on the role of a young man named Elvis. No, not the king of rock and roll. Rather, someone who has been abandoned by his mother in &quot;the wastelands of America&quot;. Elvis will not be alone on his travels, however. He will also have his robot &#x27;brother&#x27; Diggs by his side.

However, the judge has allowed a separate part of the lawsuit to go ahead - one which seeks to claim that EA games adopted &quot;deceptive and unconsionable acts or practices&quot; under a Canadian consumer protection act. 


Responding to the news via GamesIndustry.biz, an EA spokesperson stated: &quot;We&#x27;re pleased that the trial court rejected, as a matter of law, the allegations of unlawful gaming. The court&#x27;s decision reaffirms our position that nothing in our games constitutes gambling.&quot;

Ghostwriter was demoed on stage at GDC this week by Ubisoft researcher Ben Swanson, who stated the tool was designed for use with background dialogue, barks (generic lines from NPCs triggered by the player), and descriptions for the game&#x27;s user interface.


According to Game Developer, which attended the GDC session, Swanson described the tool as like a &quot;30,000-sided die&quot; which could be rolled to build sentences based on an initial input combined with a modifier, with machine learning built in to ensure responses varied.

Here is a little trailer showing how it all looks in play:

Following on from Leon&#x27;s arrival in the village, this next episode - known as &quot;A promise between the two&quot; - starts with a rather sweet moment between Leon and Ashley. Leon presses the importance of Ashley staying close to him, and in turn Ashley promises that she will. Smash cut to Ashley not exactly doing that.


I won&#x27;t spoil the short clip for you. Instead, please take a moment to enjoy the next part of this glorious marketing beat from Capcom and Nippon Animation in the video below.

                              <span>A group of gamers have failed in their attempt to sue Microsoft over its impending $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. 


The 10-strong party lawyered up late last year to launch a lawsuit which claimed Microsoft&#x27;s buyout would give the Xbox owner too much influence over the games industry &quot;to foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition&quot;.


This week, a judge dismissed the &quot;so-called gamers&#x27; lawsuit&quot; as it &quot;does not plausibly allege the merger creates a reasonable probability of anticompetitive effects in any relevant market&quot; (thanks, Foss Patents).

                              <span>In a heavily redacted response to the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority relating to its proposed $69BN USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft has insisted Sony would be able to create its own Call of Duty alternative within the space of 10 years.


Microsoft&#x27;s newly published document has been submitted in response to the CMA&#x27;s recent Remedies Hearing, discussing stipulations the regulator may insist upon before it&#x27;s prepared to approve the deal. And while much has been redacted, it predominantly presents Microsoft&#x27;s arguments around why its proposed 10-year deal with Sony to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation, and its signed agreements with Nvidia, should be sufficient to satisfy the CMA&#x27;s concerns.


Among all this, though, is the nugget from Microsoft that 10 years should be ample time for Sony to whip up a Call of Duty competitor of its own - while glossing over the rather obvious fact Activision&#x27;s shooter has had over 20 years to build the kind of brand recognition that&#x27;s turned it into the juggernaut gaming franchise it is today.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s live-action Gears of War movie is now one step closer to becoming a reality following the news Dune and Doctor Strange screenwriter Jon Spaihts has been hired to handle the script.


Netflix announced it had acquired the rights to adapt Gear of War into movie last November, following earlier unsuccessful attempts by 
New Line Cinema to get a live-action adaptation off the ground. That version, first trumpeted in 2007, had abandoned all pretence of being set in the game&#x27;s universe by 2019, when the project became permanently stuck in development hell.


Netflix, however, has specifically described its version as an adaptation of the Gears of War &quot;video game saga&quot;, suggesting it&#x27;ll be more faithful to the source material than Universal&#x27;s stalled effort - and the streaming service has now announced it&#x27;ll be down to writer Jon Spaihts, whose Dune screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, to conjure a script into being.

                              <span>Breath still bated for more information on developer Insomniac&#x27;s upcoming Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2? Well it looks like we might now have a release month thanks to Venom actor Tony Todd, who - almost certainly without official approval - has claimed it&#x27;ll be arriving this September.


Todd - whose prolific career has included roles in the likes of Platoon, Candyman, and Final Destination - was announced to be voicing Venom in Spider-Man 2 back in September 2021, at the same time Insomniac confirmed Yuri Lowenthal and Nadji Jeter would be returning to voice Peter Parker and Miles Morales respectively.


Since then, official word on the sequel has been almost non-existent, but Insomniac did pop up in December, following a bit of a leak by a writer on the project, to confirm it was aiming to release Spider-Man 2 some time in &quot;fall 2023&quot;.

EA says the move is being made as it prepares to shutdown the games&#x27; online services - a process currently scheduled to occur on 8th December 2023.


After that date, owners will still be able to access all offline feature - including single-player campaigns - in Mirror&#x27;s Edge and Bad Company 1 &amp; 2. However, the multiplayer-only Battlefield 1943 will no longer be playable.

                              <span>Jake Solomon, best known for his work on the XCOM series and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, is looking to fund a fresh studio in order to &quot;make a new kind of game&quot;.


Earlier this year, Solomon announced he was leaving Firaxis after more than two decades to &quot;[embark] on a new chapter&quot;. 


At this point, the XCOM designer did not go into specifics about what this new chapter would look like, only saying that his brain was &quot;on fire with a new dream&quot; and this was the &quot;time to go chase it&quot;.

As previously announced, Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom will become available for cloud, Xbox consoles and PC today. This is the follow-up to Level 5&#x27;s role-playing game classic, and includes a fresh battle system that&#x27;s more Pikmin than Pokémon. 


Oh, and a nice touch - you get the Prince&#x27;s Edition version of the game here, which includes extra DLCs. Handy!

Though unnamed at present, the game will once again be for VR. A playtest will take place from 14-16th April, which players can sign up for now.



The project is something the studio has been wanting to develop since its inception in 2015, but required a large enough VR player base to support a multiplayer game.

Those familiar faces are Merrin and Greez, albeit with new looks (after all, Survivor takes place five years after the events of Fallen Order). Merrin has a new hairstyle, while Greez has a new arm. 


Additionally, this trailer shows us Cal using his ascension cable for climbing and crossing, as well as the young Jedi visiting the ecumenopolis planet of Coruscant. And, of course, there is plenty of lightsaber and blaster action to feast your eyes on. You can have a watch for yourself below:

Announced during December&#x27;s Game Awards, Crash Team Rumble is a team-based four-versus-four MOBA, which is set to release later this year. Players must do their utmost to collect more Wumpa Fruit than their opponents to claim victory, while also defending their  own Wumpa drop-off zone. This is all done through the use of various skills and abilities.


We haven&#x27;t actually seen or heard all that much about Crash Team Rumble since its announcement, so here is its reveal trailer as a little refresher:

                              <span>Project Sirius, a spin-off from The Witcher announced by publisher CD Projekt Red last year, sounds like it&#x27;s being rebooted from scratch. 


Last night, the company announced its intention to write-off funds allocated for the project, which was being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio The Molasses Flood. 


Today, a CD Projekt spokesperson told Eurogamer that the publisher was now working to ensure Project Sirius was better &quot;aligned with the strategy of the CD Projekt Group&quot;.

                              <span>More than 400 Twitch employees have lost their jobs as part of a further round of layoffs at parent company Amazon.


Amazon announced another 9,000 job cuts - in addition to the 18,000 layoffs it made in January - earlier today, with new Twitch CEO Dan Clancy confirming 400 employees at the streaming company would be affected by the decision.


As reported by Polygon, however, Twitch did not inform those impacted by the layoffs ahead of today&#x27;s announcement. Instead, Clancy told employees in an all-staff email that everyone affected will be informed &quot;no later than early next week&quot;.

As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Respawn&#x27;s newest studio - which will operate alongside existing teams in Sherman Oaks, California and Vancouver, British Columbia - is based in Madison, Wisconsin, and run by former Epic Games director of engine production Ryan Burnett.


Respawn Wisconsin will predominantly be focussed on supporting the development of Apex Legends&#x27; live service operations, although it may also contribute to other projects in the future.

                              <span>After a tiny tease last week, Paradox Interactive has properly unveiled Life by You, a new open-world life simulator that&#x27;s launching into PC early access on 12th September.


Developed by Paradox Tectonic - the studio headed by Rod Humble, former Sims boss and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs - Life by You&#x27;s marketing immediately slings shade in the direction of The Sims 4, describing the title as a game that&#x27;ll let players &quot;create humans and live out their lives without loading screens&quot;.


While the fundamentals - from house building to character creation - all seem very Sims-like, Paradox is trumpeting an &quot;open game world where everything is customisable&quot;, alongside &quot;real language conversation&quot; and the ability for players to directly control their digital humans if they&#x27;d prefer something more hands-on than the default third-person view.

                              <span>The New York Times is reporting that a US citizen’s phone was hacked by the Predator spyware.
A U.S. and Greek national who worked on Meta’s security and trust team while based in Greece was placed under a yearlong wiretap by the Greek national intelligence service and hacked with a powerful cyberespionage tool, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and officials with knowledge of the case.
The disclosure is the first known case of an American citizen being targeted in a European Union country by the advanced snooping technology, the use of which has been the subject of a widening scandal in Greece. It demonstrates that the illicit use of spyware is spreading beyond use by authoritarian governments against opposition figures and journalists, and has begun to creep into European democracies, even ensnaring a foreign national working for a major global corporation...</span>

In a conversation with Jonathon Ross on the host&#x27;s ITV chat show last Friday, Ramsey stated the next series&#x27; arrival will &quot;be a while&quot;. She did, however, reiterate Pedro Pascal&#x27;s previous comments that shooting could start as soon as &quot;end of this year, beginning of next&quot;.


In addition to chatting more about the series&#x27; future, Ramsey also spoke of her relationship with Pascal. &quot;I love him,&quot; she told Ross. When discussing their friendship, Ramsey joked &quot;imagine if it was all fake, that would be rough!&quot; Ross then quipped: &quot;That would be acting.&quot;

The streamer became legendary in the game&#x27;s community for assisting players struggling with its most difficult optional boss: Malenia.


Not content with defeating the boss a thousand times and receiving an honorary sword for the effort, Let Me Solo Her is now playing a modded run where every enemy is Malenia.

The latest development video shows off two new weapons coming to Fallout: London - the Viper Mark One and the Laser Lewis gun. Both of these guns look like they can do some serious damage, with the Laser Lewis being described as the ideal weapon to &quot;Goo-ify your enemies in style&quot;.


In addition to weaponry, the team has also given another look at some of the items being inserted into the mod to really give it that British feel: phone boxes, bins and roadworks, all of which are instantly recognisable from the capital.

With Team Rocket seemingly written out of the series alongside Ash and Pikachu, the stage is set for another faction to bother the show&#x27;s already-introduced trio of heroes (and new mascot Captain Pikachu).


Step forward the &quot;Explorers&quot;, as they&#x27;re being referred to in Japan. Members of this group include Amejio, a mysterious figure whose partner Pokémon is Paldean creature Ceruledge. Is this person our new rival, akin to Gary Oak?

The project is apparently titled Lego 2K Drive, and reportedly features short &quot;Mario Kart-style&quot; races where your vehicle changes automatically across terrain while driving. 


Images posted to reddit show courses with various Lego themes, such as a race through a spooky biome, and an area that looks like the Wild West.

                              <span>Microsoft is planning to launch its own app store for games across mobile devices, according to Phil Spencer.


In March 2024 new rules are expected under the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act, which will require Apple and Google to open their mobile platforms to app stores owned and operated by other companies.


Microsoft aims to capitalise on this with its own Xbox platform, for which its proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard is a key element.

                              <span>The Resident Evil 4 remake is releasing later this week, and in anticipation Capcom has upped its marketing efforts with a short Studio Ghibli-style anime based on the game. While I am no anime critic, I have to say it is glorious.


Titled &quot;Leon and the Mysterious Village&quot;, the first episode was released earlier today. It begins with a certain Mr  Leon S. Kennedy, wearing everyone&#x27;s favourite jacket, searching for Ashley. 


&quot;I wonder where Ashely went,&quot; Leon asks himself in a rather casual manner (although, with his gun still aloft). Ah, a nice villager! Perhaps they will be able to help.

Appending the usual disclaimer that future plans are always subject to change, the team then detailed what&#x27;s new for &quot;in-game, out-game, and anti-cheat features&quot;.

&quot;Before we unveil the roadmap, we would like to thank each and every one of you for the 6th Anniversary of PUBG,&quot; the team said via a forum post.

A couple of weeks back, we reported that it looked like a new version of CS:GO – possibly called Counter-Strike 2 – was in development. And while there was no formal word from Valve, Steam, or anyone else for that matter, several prominent leakers and a journalist stepped up to report that &quot;a new version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is on its way&quot;, saying it is &quot;almost certainly set to be released under the working title of Counter-Strike 2&quot;.

Whilst BAFTA polled its Twitter followers to ascertain the community&#x27;s favourite pairing, Stamper replied that &quot;if Banjo-Kazooie wins, [composer] Grant Kirkhope and [Stamper] will lick this 25-year-old chocolate BAFTA&quot; (thanks, Time Extension).

                              <span>Yu Suzuki has teamed with an NFT firm to create 1000 Virtua Fighter NFTs.

Whilst Sega is not formally involved in the project, it has reportedly permitted Suzuki - who created the Virtua Fighter series over 30 years ago – to use assets from the first three games to create a range of NFTs that will &quot;include 11 characters from the first three Virtua Fighter games into [NFT firm] OASYX&#x27;s creative worlds, creating a unique and exciting experience for new and old fans of Virtua Fighter alike&quot;.

The NFTs will also &quot;serve as a base for future Metaverse avatars&quot;.

                              <span>ZA/UM has released a new &quot;Collage Mode&quot; for Disco Elysium.

The brand-new mode – which is out now on PC, and coming to consoles &quot;over the coming days&quot; – gives players &quot;full access to characters, environments, effects, and custom dialogue to create the screenshots that they have always desired&quot;.

The new mode lets players place characters &quot;across the game&#x27;s paintery environments and then pick from a range of silly and sensible poses&quot;, apply filters and frames, and even write their own dialogue to &quot;create a whole story with a single image by entering custom text that can be placed anywhere&quot;.

It is Creative Assembly&#x27;s third studio, alongside its other teams in Sussex, UK, and Sofia, Bulgaria.

                              <span>Destiny players have flocked to the Tower to pay their respects to the late, great, Lance Reddick.

Reddick – who died yesterday of &quot;natural causes&quot;, aged just 60 – is known for his roles in John Wick, The Wire, and Lost – but his unique voice is perhaps best known by the Destiny community, for which Reddick portrayed Commander Zavala since the series began back in 2014.

Guardians are marking Reddick&#x27;s death by gathering alongside Zavala at the Tower, where dozens of players are sitting in quiet contemplation, some marking his passing with sombre emotes.

                              <span>Blizzard has thanked players for their patience after some were left waiting in hour-long queues to participate in Diablo 4&#x27;s open beta test this weekend.

In a statement posted to the game&#x27;s official forum, the community team assured players that it was &quot;actively working&quot; on the issues, vowing to &quot;increase the influx of players&quot; and reduce queue times once numerous disconnection issues had been addressed.

In an update posted a few hours later, community manager PezRadar thanked everyone for the &quot;overwhelming response to the Early Access beta weekend&quot; and reaffirmed that the team was &quot;tracking and actively working on&quot; issues with drop-in/drop-out multiplayer, rubberbanding whilst transitioning zones, and high RAM and GPU usage. The team is also aware of a problem where &quot;players that are dropped from a game receive an error that their party does not exist&quot;.

                              <span>Actor Lance Reddick - star of John Wick, The Wire, and Destiny - has died, aged 60.


Reddick&#x27;s prolific acting career began in the mid-90s, spanning television - where he rose to prominence with starring roles in shows such as The Wire and Fringe - film, most notably in the John Wick franchise, and, in later years, video games. 


Reddick&#x27;s gaming roles included Martin Hatch in developer Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s 2016 action-adventure Quantum Break and Sylens in Guerrilla Games&#x27; Horizon series. However, he was perhaps best known as the voice of Destiny&#x27;s Commander Zavala, a pivotal character in Bungie&#x27;s ongoing narrative who first appeared in 2014.

                              <span>Layers of Fear - the somewhat confusingly named remake of developer Bloober Team&#x27;s psychedelic horror hits Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2 - has resurfaced with an 11-minute trailer showing off some of its gameplay changes and fancy new Unreal Engine 5 visuals.


Layers of Fear (formerly Layers of Fears) is co-developed with Anshar Studios, and sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt and reimagined in Unreal Engine 5 as a single, generations-spanning &quot;psychedelic horror chronicle&quot;. It also includes new chapter The Final Note, offering a different perspective on the events of first game. 


Bloober&#x27;s new gameplay walkthrough finally answers one of the lingering questions around the remake, namely how its disparate elements will be turned into something resembling a coherent whole. That job, it turns out, is the responsibility of new lighthouse-bound character The Writer, whose &quot;harrowing tale...ties each entry in the series together&quot;.

                              <span>Team17 staff have reported a round of layoffs, as the Worms developer and indie game publisher seeks to restructure its business. 


Staff were told of the changes at 4pm this Friday afternoon in a mandatory all-hands meeting, those who were present told Eurogamer.


Impacted team members include those in the company&#x27;s art and design teams, Eurogamer understands, as the company shifts its focus further towards its publishing side, and external development of its own IP.

                              <span>EU regulators have delayed a decision on Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69BN acquisition of Activision Blizzard after the company submitted remedies in its efforts gain approval.


The European Commission had previously announced a provisional deadline of 25th April for its decision on the controversial takeover, but, as reported by Reuters, that has now shifted to 22nd May as its reviews Microsoft&#x27;s latest submissions.


Details of these remedies have not been made public, as per EU policy, but it&#x27;s likely these relate to a flurry of recent deals Microsoft has signed in a bid to be seen as willing to bring Call of Duty - a particular sticking point for regulators in the EU, US, and UK - to competing services.

                              <span>Starfield, Bethesda&#x27;s forthcoming space RPG, has been given a Restricted rating in Australia.


As spotted by GameInfinitus, the game&#x27;s classification is primarily due to interactive drug use, as well as the strong impact of violence and some nudity.


The Australian Classification Board has a particularly low tolerance to drug use in games. The likes of Disco Elysium, DayZ, and RimWorld were all initially banned from sale in Australia due to themes of drug use.

This update follows a rocky launch for KSP2, which saw a steep fall in player numbers soon after its release, with many asking for refunds.

Creative director Nate Simpson stated the KSP2 team has implemented &quot;a lot of big improvements&quot; with this update, including a fix for the bug that saw environmental objects &quot;[spawning] on top of the active vessel&quot; (something that would cause the Kerbal Space Center to move).

                              <span>The arrival of Resident Evil 2 and 4 hero Leon S. Kennedy into Fortnite should be a cause for celebration, but fans were left stunned last night when the series&#x27; perfectly-coiffed protagonist turned up half-dressed.


No, he&#x27;s not topless - though there&#x27;s a Resident Evil 4 Remake demo mod for that if you so choose. Instead, Fortnite&#x27;s Leon is missing his iconic jacket from the early stages of Resident Evil 4, and indeed any other style option. 


Fans have complained it is a missed oppurtunity for Fortnite&#x27;s version of Leon, and compared his character model to those for fellow Resi stars Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, who are already available in Fortnite featuring multiple outfits from their various appearances.

Storyteller, which has been in development for quite some time now (Annapurna was first associated with it back in 2018), is described as a reactive puzzle game about building stories.


Essentially, the idea is to build a coherent yarn across a page of comic-book-style panels, placing the appropriate characters, backgrounds, and plot devices to reach the specified outcome - which can range from tales of loves to stories of revenge and betrayal.

Starting with that discount, Valve is slashing the price of Steam Deck - that is, of all three models across all shipping regions - by 10%. That means UK resident can currently pick up the 64GB model for £314.10, the 256GB model for £413.10, and the 512GB model for £512.10.


Valve says the discount will remain available until the end of Steam&#x27;s Spring Sale, which starts today and runs until 5pm GMT/10am PT on 23rd March.

Specifics remain incredibly limited at present - the title is currently in the pre-production phase according to Splash Damage - but it&#x27;s being described as an &quot;AAA open-world survival game&quot; developed in collaboration with streamers Mike &quot;Shroud&quot; Grzesiek and Chris &quot;Sacriel&quot; Ball.


There&#x27;s no Project Astrid footage or even a hint of concept art at this early juncture - today&#x27;s announcement trailer and assets are solely focused on the involvement of its two big-name streamers - but Splash Damage says it&#x27;ll have more to reveal &quot;in the near future&quot;.

Writing on Twitter today, Techland described the project as a  &quot;narrative-driven fantasy epic with an exotic open world ready to be explored&quot;. 


Artwork shows a human holding onto the branches of an enormous tree, overlooking a fantasy landscape and a sky filled with a ripped-apart moon. A few creatures are also shown - what looks like parrots and a lemur.

                              <span>Epic Games has confirmed the launch date of its long-awaited Unreal Editor for Fortnite: and it arrives next week, on 22nd March. 


&quot;What is Unreal Editor for Fortnite? Why should I care?&quot; I hear you ask. Well, here&#x27;s the thing. This software is likely not going to herald any grand new addition to Fortnite immediately at launch.


Over time, however, it will transform Fortnite into an advanced platform for custom-made games and experiences - where you can launch almost any Unreal Engine-made creation to an in-built audience of millions.

                              <span>The most recent update to the Nintendo Switch version of Minecraft has seemingly introduced a bug which prevents players from playing the game.

The update was rolled out earlier this week on Tuesday, and contains fixes for &quot;over 30&quot; issues, as well as content in preparation for the upcoming 1.20 update.

Unfortunately, it also added the aforementioned bug, leaving some players unable to load their saves.

&quot;SIE [Sony Interactive Entertainment] cannot protect against the loss of Call of Duty,&quot; Sony wrote in a document published today by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority regulator, which is currently scrutinising the deal. 


Simply put, Sony says it cannot compete with a Microsoft-owned and Xbox-exclusive Call of Duty via its own blockbuster first-party franchises: not in terms of gameplay hours, revenue, or in the budget it has to spend on building its own exclusives.

                              <span>Controversial former WWE boss Vince McMahon appears as a playable character in WWE 2K23.


The inclusion of McMahon, first reported by Axios, has raised eyebrows following his resignation as CEO and brief retirement from WWE last summer after multiple claims of sexual harassment and assault. 


WWE ultimately admitted McMahon had paid $19.6m to settle various sexual misconduct claims over the past two decades. Despite this, McMahon returned to the company to serve as its chairman in January of this year.

                              <span>It looks like Valve won&#x27;t be releasing an OLED model of its handheld Steam Deck in the near future.

Steam Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais commented on the feasibility of an OLED model in an interview with PC Gamer, in which he explained why it won&#x27;t be possible in the near future.

&quot;The screen&#x27;s at the core of the device,&quot; Griffais explained. Putting in an OLED screen to replace the Steam Deck&#x27;s LCD screen wouldn&#x27;t be a simple swap, he continued, as all of the components are architected around each other for a device that&#x27;s so small.

However, if you will excuse the unintentional pun, there have been some teething issues with this update, and several Simmers have noticed their adorable babies aging up into long-legged monstrosities. 


A collection of posts across Reddit and the EA answers HQ reveal that some infants are appearing with a significantly stretched body, leaving them to look like they are atop some kind of humanoid stilts.

Xevious and Side Pocket, two ports of arcade games, join the NES and SNES libraries respectively. Xevious is a scrolling shooter with similarities to Space Invaders, whilst Side Pocket is a billiards simulation.

I might boot that one up to fill the void in my life that Miniclip&#x27;s 8 Ball Pool left behind.

The news follows last year&#x27;s underwhelming launch of Need for Speed Unbound, which arrived to a warm critical response but little fanfare from publisher EA.


Fuse Games will be led by former Criterion boss Matt Webster, with four former Criterion co-founders in senior roles. Together, the team has worked together for nearly two decades on Criterion&#x27;s various projects: Burnout, Battlefield, Star Wars: Battlefront and Need for Speed.

                              <span>Baked beans and ketchup maker Heinz has built a tomato awareness campaign in Fortnite, using a map that attempts to recreate one of its own tomato farms. 


Dubbed &quot;SOS Tomatoes&quot;, the map is designed to highlight a genuine good cause: the falling levels of soil quality  worldwide due to over farming. Information on the map will detail more about the threats to soil health - and hopefully provide some proper STEM learning.


Heinz describes the experience as a &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot;, with a faster shrinking storm to... highlight the &quot;rapid rate at which soil health is declining&quot;. Now that&#x27;s quite the pickle.

                              <span>Criterion and EA have unveiled Need for Speed Unbound: Volume 2, a free content update coming to all platforms next Wednesday, 21st March.


Volume 2 - said to be the first in what will presumably be a series of post-launch updates for Criterion&#x27;s well-received racer - looks to bring a little bit more of everything, starting with the introduction of cop chases in multiplayer. &quot;Stay ahead of the chase to make Bank while your friends help knock them off your tail,&quot; is how Criterion explains the addition in its announcement, &quot;or take the Heat off you for their own rewards.


Alongside multiplayer cop skirmishes - which come complete with new banner rewards - Volume 2 ushers in Daily Challenges, with players able to complete up to three (selected from a pool of 40) each day in order to earn XP and Bank. There&#x27;s also a &quot;special luxury ride&quot; for those that complete enough challenges.

                              <span>With a year almost expired since Ghostwire: Tokyo&#x27;s launch on PC and PS5 as a timed console exclusive, Bethesda has announced the game is making the leap to Xbox Series X/S on 12th April - complete with new content for all platforms. 


Ghostwire: Tokyo, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, comes from The Evil Within and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, plunging players into a supernaturally hued open world jaunt around an absolutely gorgeously rendered Tokyo - one almost entirely purged of human life thanks to some nefarious shenanigans.


Reviews were middling at launch thanks to some rather same-y combat and some basic mechanical building blocks that are recycled just a little bit too often, but, personally, I&#x27;ve been having a blast of late bounding across Tokyo&#x27;s rooftops, sucking up souls, and getting a thorough (and often quite spooky) education in Japan&#x27;s rich folklore.

That update makes steps towards the game&#x27;s ideal of full in-game persistence, with the addition of Persistent Entity Streaming tech now implemented in Alpha 3.18. It means objects can be dynamically tracked when moved by players.


However, the update has attracted enough players back to the game that login and server issues have become a major problem for the developer.

                              <span>Game director Mathijs de Jonge has promised Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s Burning Shores DLC will fully embrace the &quot;power&quot; of the PlayStation 5, in a bid to explain why the add-on is exclusive to Sony&#x27;s newer console. 


Burning Shores will see Forbidden West&#x27;s protagonist Aloy heading out to the &quot;untamed wilds of Los Angeles&quot; following the events of Forbidden West&#x27;s main campaign.
However, despite the base game releasing across both PlayStation 5 and PS4 consoles, Burning Shores is a PS5 exclusive.

The hugely-talented animator Cara Aleatorio has recreated Resident Evil 4&#x27;s opening in digital Lego, in a polished and surprisingly authentic homage.


From the original audio cues and camera angles taken from the game to the wear, tear and thumbprints on the digital Lego models, this is quite the treat for those who have this opening to the original Resident Evil 4 seared in their brains.

                              <span>The developer of Bleak Faith: Forsaken will now replace assets purchased from the Epic Marketplace, after being accused of using animations stolen from FromSoftware.

Earlier this week, Archangel Studios released its Soulslike game, but players noted that some animations were almost identical to some found in Elden Ring.


The developer has now responded to the accusations, stating the response received from Epic was &quot;not satisfactory for us&quot;.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has confirmed that, after eight years and with a sequel in sight, the end is nigh for Cities: Skylines&#x27; DLC support, with a final selection of content arriving in May.


The news comes as Cities: Skylines developer Colossal Order - which recently announced a long-awaited sequel for release this year - shares one last roadmap for its acclaimed city building game, starting with a first drop of DLC next Wednesday, 22nd March.


This&#x27;ll take the form of three new Content Creator Packs - Africa in Miniature, Sports Venues, and Shopping Malls - plus three new radio stations. JADIA Radio Station brings 16 Africa-inspired tracks from musician Wan Shey, while 80&#x27;s Movie Tunes is a fairly self-explanatory set of 15 tracks totally around 70 minutes of music. Finally, there&#x27;s Pop-Punk Radio, which promises 16 track and 75 minutes of &quot;powerful, high-beat tunes&quot;.

                              <span>The messy saga of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM - which has been embroiled in a series of legal tussles relating to the involuntary departure of key team members in 2021 - has reached a new milestone, with the company announcing several of those lawsuits have now been resolved.


It&#x27;s a story that first made headlines last October, when ZA/UM founder Martin Luiga claimed Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov had been fired following the company&#x27;s takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus (now ZA/UM CEO), and Tõnis Haavel, previously convicted of investment fraud.


Not long after confirming the news of their departure, Kurvitz and Rostov shared an open letter claiming Kompus and Haavel&#x27;s takeover of ZA/UM was fraudulent and that they were booted out of the studio while trying to discover more. Kompus and Haavel then fired back, insisting the former employees had been dismissed for &quot;belittling women and co-workers&quot;, creating a &quot;toxic environment&quot;, and &quot;intending to steal IP&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Heart Machine has shared a first gameplay trailer for Hyper Light Breaker - its fully 3D rogue-lite follow-up to 2016&#x27;s acclaimed Hyper Light Drifter - alongside the news it&#x27;ll be entering Steam early access some time this autumn.


Hyper Light Breaker, which was unveiled last March, trades its predecessor&#x27;s wonderfully explorable top-down, 2D world in favour of a &quot;vast, ever-changing&quot; 3D landscape - blending handcrafted and procedurally generated elements - known as the Overgrowth.


Here, amid open biomes and deep labyrinths, players (working solo or with up to three friends) can deploy a mix of acrobatic abilities - wall-dashing, hoverboarding, gliding - and third-person combat as they take on monsters and bosses in an attempt to overthrow the Abyss King.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive has slapped a 4th April launch date on its first-person building and raiding game Meet Meet Your Maker, confirming that - alongside its PlayStation, Xbox, and PC retail release - it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation Plus on day one.


Meet Your Maker whisks players (either solo or along with a co-op friend) to a post-apocalyptic wasteland where they&#x27;re able to build their own maze-like outpost filled with devious traps and patrolling guards. Once the stage is (literally) set, that outpost is then hoovered up into the internet ether, whereupon other players can raid it in an attempt to best its challenge.


&quot;Every outpost in Meet Your Maker requires you build a clear path from its entrance to the Genmat at its core,&quot; Behaviour Interactive explains in a post on the PlayStation Blog, &quot;but nothing says this path should be easy to navigate... Twisting hallways, verticality, multiple branching corridors, and trap-filled dead ends are all great ways to confound raiders.&quot;

                              <span>Folks have been making noises for a while that Amazon is anti-competitive in a variety of ways. I don’t disagree with the overall sentiment, but there’s one particular aspect of how AWS advantages its own offerings that I don’t see folks talking about–and strikes me as particularly egregious.
The post AWS’s Anti-Competitive Move Hidden in Plain Sight appeared first on Last Week in AWS.</span>

                              <span>Tekken veteran Marshall Law has always been a pretty on the nose copy of legendary martial arts movie star Bruce Lee, but his incarnation in the upcoming Tekken 8 ramps the familiarity up another notch.


Bandai Namco released a gameplay video showing off Marshall Law in Tekken 8, below, and it includes all the Bruce Lee mannerisms you&#x27;d expect: the &#x27;come and get some&#x27; hand signal, the high-pitched noises, the nose flick and the finger point.


In the trailer we see Law use nunchucks as Lee famously did in his iconic Hollywood hit Enter the Dragon. He also flexes his muscles as Lee did in his movies. He even copies Lee&#x27;s facial expressions.

                              <span>Meta, the owner of Facebook and maker of Meta Quest VR headsets, will cut a further 10,000 jobs this year and close around 5000 additional open roles, as part of a &quot;year of efficiency&quot;.


These cuts come on top of the previous 10,000 job losses announced back in November last year, which equated to a loss of 13 percent of all Meta employees globally. 


Announcing the changes publicly via his Facebook page, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg blamed higher US interest rates, global geopolitical instability and increased regulation, on top of last year&#x27;s slowdown in revenue which he dubbed as a &quot;humbling wake-up call&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox has today announced another 10-year agreement, this time with Ukranian cloud gaming platform Boosteroid, as Microsoft continues to try and shore up support for its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal.


Boosteroid&#x27;s four million users will soon be able to access Xbox PC games via their streaming subscription, with Activision Blizzard PC games to also become available when (or rather, if) Microsoft&#x27;s buyout takes place.


It&#x27;s a very similar deal to the one Microsoft previously announced with Nvidia to bring Xbox PC games its GeForce Now streaming service.

                              <span>The long-awaited remake of System Shock will now launch for PC on Tuesday 30th May - a delay of two months from its previous March launch window.


That date will apply to the game&#x27;s release on all major PC platforms, including Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store. 


&quot;We had hoped to bring the game to market by the end of March,&quot; publisher Plaion acknowledged, &quot;but that turned out to be just beyond our reach; we are after all merely human (unlike Shodan!)&quot;

                              <span>The Last of Us&#x27; series finale aired earlier this week, breaking another viewership record for HBO in the process. 


This episode concluded our journey to the Fireflies, and featured a particular sequence that many have dubbed Joel&#x27;s &quot;John Wick moment&quot; (I am sure there is a Naughty Dog pun in here somewhere).


Now, co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have shared a little bit more on this part of the series, calling it a &quot;God mode power up&quot;.

Now it&#x27;s actually happened, as Yaza Games announced that Andreas from Pentiment is playable in its ink-based strategy game about farting donkeys.


Andreas is playable in both the Journey mode and in Duels.

For those keeping track, this is the antepenultimate episode of the series&#x27; final 11-episode arc which wraps up Ash Ketchum&#x27;s saga.

This offer also follows the welcome return of classes to lend the game a better sense of structure: the familiar Assault, Recon, Support, and Engineer.

                              <span>Another week, another record breaking episode debut for The Last of Us.


The show&#x27;s season finale, which aired on Sunday evening/Monday morning depending on which side of the pond you are, saw 8.2 million viewers tuning in for the conclusion of Joel and Ellie&#x27;s journey to find the Fireflies. This number is for viewers across &quot;HBO Max and linear telecasts&quot;, and based on Nielsen and first party data.


In a press release, HBO stated the series is currently averaging 30.4 million viewers across its first six episodes. Its pilot episode, meanwhile, is now approaching 40 million viewers. These figures make The Last of Us &quot;the most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in both Europe and Latin America&quot;.

                              <span>Following reports that E3 2023 would be a no-show for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, Microsoft has confirmed it won&#x27;t have a show floor presence at this year&#x27;s event - although its recently announced online showcase will be part of an E3-branded week of digital shows.


News that the big three console manufacturers would be skipping this year&#x27;s E3 - set to be held between 13th and 16th June - was first reported by IGN in January. One month later, Nintendo confirmed its absence, saying, &quot;We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis [and] this year&#x27;s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans&quot;.


It wasn&#x27;t particularly surprising news, given Nintendo hasn&#x27;t held a major E3 conference for over a decade now and last had a showfloor presence at E3 back in 2019, but there were hopes that this year&#x27;s organiser (Eurogamer parent company Reedpop) might be able to coax the major players back in its attempts to revitalise a flagging formula - which, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, hasn&#x27;t had an in-person component since 2019.

                              <span>CD Projekt has released a new patch for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, addressing a number of issues affecting the game&#x27;s troubled next-gen upgrade.


The Witcher 3&#x27;s long-in-the-works next-gen update finally arrived late last year, but was plagued by reports of technical issues and poor performance on both PC and consoles.


CD Projekt&#x27;s first big stab at remedying these problems arrived in February&#x27;s 4.01 patch, but, despite some progress, issues persisted. As Digital Foundry noted, for example, while PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X saw some performance improvements in their 30fps ray-tracing mode, 60fps Performance Mode had somehow ended up considerably worse.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has insisted it remains &quot;committed&quot; to Call of Duty: Mobile after Microsoft recently told UK regulators the game could be &quot;phased out&quot; over time with the full launch of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile this year.


Microsoft made the claims in its latest response to the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, which is currently investigating the company&#x27;s proposed $69BN USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In a paragraph on divestment, Microsoft noted, &quot;Call of Duty: Mobile is expected to be phased out over time (outside of China) with the launch of Warzone Mobile.&quot;


Call of Duty: Mobile - a free-to-play spin on the juggernaut franchise, developed by Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio - launched in 2019 and has been a massive success for Activision, generating $3BN in its first year alone.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Doug Bowser has addressed the company&#x27;s decision to slap the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with a $70 price tag in the US, saying it&#x27;s not &quot;necessarily&quot; a price point it&#x27;ll apply to all its titles in the future.


Nintendo confirmed Tears of the Kingdom would retail for $69.99 in the US - $10 above the price it usually adopts for its big blockbuster titles - at the start of February, leading some to wonder if this may be the new standard for the company&#x27;s games moving forward.


The move would certain align with a growing number of other publishers - including Sony, Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft, and Take-Two - who&#x27;ve recently looked to position $70 as the new normal for many of their games on consoles.

Nearly 90% of the multibillion-dollar federal lobbying apparatus in the United States serves corporate interests. In some cases, the objective of that money is obvious. Google pours millions into lobbying on bills related to antitrust regulation. Big energy companies expect action whenever there is a move to end drilling leases for federal lands, in exchange for the tens of millions they contribute to congressional reelection campaigns.
But lobbying strategies are not always so blunt, and the interests involved are not always so obvious. ...</span>

                              <span>From Brian Krebs:
A Croatian national has been arrested for allegedly operating NetWire, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) marketed on cybercrime forums since 2012 as a stealthy way to spy on infected systems and siphon passwords. The arrest coincided with a seizure of the NetWire sales website by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). While the defendant in this case hasn’t yet been named publicly, the NetWire website has been leaking information about the likely true identity and location of its owner for the past 11 years.

                              <span>There will be &quot;a lot more infected&quot; when The Last of Us&#x27; second season airs.


That&#x27;s coming from series co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin. Ahead of the first season&#x27;s finale (which aired last night/early this morning, depending on where you are. You can read my spoiler-heavy thoughts on it here), Druckmann and Mazin took part in a virtual press conference for the show. 


Here, they addressed the first season&#x27;s somewhat reduced action compared to the game it is based on. Please note, this article contains spoilers for both the show and the game. Please read on at your own discretion.

Having played the demo in its standard form, I headed over to Nexus mods to see what was what. And I was not disappointed. 


First up, we have the &quot;Banana gun and spoon knife&quot; mod uploaded by Stevebg23. This chap does exactly what it says on the tin - it replaces the Standard Handgun and the Survival Knife with a banana and a spoon.

                              <span>Cloud Imperium Games has launched a new update for the infamous MMO Star Citizen to make its world more persistent.


Alpha 3.18: Lasting Legacies has added Persistent Entity Streaming tech that allows objects moved by players to be dynamically tracked on specific servers, meaning players can now leave their mark on the world. 


The developer claims this makes the game &quot;one of the most immersive and &#x27;lived-in&#x27; experiences ever seen in games&quot;. Further, this technical update is a critical addition in laying the foundation for full in-game persistence.

                              <span>The developers of Soulslike Bleak Faith: Forsaken have hit back at critics claiming it&#x27;s used stolen animations from FromSoftware.


A number of images and videos have been shared online with side-by-side comparisons of the animations used in Bleak Faith and Elden Ring, which admittedly do look identical.


However, developer Archangel Studios has stated that animations and art have been taken from the Epic Marketplace.

                              <span>A third, secret, weapon has been discovered in the Resident Evil 4 Remake&#x27;s demo.


If players are canny, they can come across the TMP (or, &#x27;tactical machine pistol&#x27;). This weapon holds 50 rounds at once, and makes things a lot easier for those pitting themselves against the hoards of parasite-infested villagers.


To get hold of this weapon in the demo, you will need to discard everything in your inventory before getting to the village.

                              <span>The previously-promised patch for Kerbal Space Program 2 should be arriving on 16th March.


In a recent update, creative director Nate Simpson stated the KSP2 team is continuing to make &quot;good headway on performance improvement and bug squashing&quot;. This has meant that, in addition to the previous list of upcoming fixes, the developer has managed to &quot;sneak&quot; a few more improvements into KSP2&#x27;s first patch. 


These include &quot;a fairly high-impact resource flow optimisation&quot; and a fix for the &quot;&#x27;Kraken Drive&#x27; bug that created insane reverse thrust when an engine&#x27;s nozzle was obstructed&quot;.

The hack, claimed by a community from a Russian social network, comes ahead of the game&#x27;s release later this year. 


The studio has released a statement on Twitter in response, requesting fans refrain from sharing leaked material and spoilers.

The shooter - which has been around in one form or another for over 20 years at this point - recently surpassed its own concurrent record, hitting an all-time peak of 1.32 million players last month.

In a tweet on the game&#x27;s official Twitter account over the weekend, the team thanked its 1.4m Twitter followers for &quot;organising and playing CS:GO concurrently today&quot;, which was a very smooth segue into noting the shooter&#x27;s all-new concurrent record.

The first in an &quot;entirely new class category&quot; called Specialists, the Artist is &quot;capable of tactical versatility with illusion powers, and specialises in supporting her team&quot;.

&quot;The Artist’s Class identity is built around the Harmony Meter Identity Gauge,&quot; Amazon explains. &quot;Landing skills on enemies will fill up three Harmony Orbs which can be used to cast two Identity Skills – Moonfall and Sunrise.

                              <span>We already knew that Endnight&#x27;s early access survival horror Sons of the Forest has been a big hit – it almost instantly blew up on Steam, and managed to sell &quot;over two million copies in the first 24 hours&quot; – but now that success is tipping over into its fan-favourite predecessor, too.

As detailed on the PS Blog, predecessor The Forest has seen a spike in player count, too, proving to be a favourite for players on Sony consoles as well as PC.

Whilst the game has been, admittedly, consistently popular, since the release of Sons of the Forest, the prequel has catapulted back into PlayStation&#x27;s Top 10 chart. According to Sony, it was the eighth most-downloaded PS4 game in the US/Canada in February, and the third most-downloaded in Europe, with only Minecraft and The Last of Us Part 2 proving more popular.

According to Axios, the tech megacorp is &quot;pitching its Cloud program as proof it remains invested in gaming&quot;, despite shuttering its cloud gaming service, Stadia, back in January.

&quot;It was at that moment when we basically had to make decisions about Stadia that we realized that, at Google Cloud, we are at our best when we’re helping other people build this stuff, not necessarily building it ourselves,&quot; Google Cloud’s director of game industry solutions, Jack Buser, told Axios.

Whilst the shooter was only released in September 2021, developer Ratloop Game partnered with publisher Frontier to confirm the closure, saying the game will be pulled from sale on 11th April 2023, and shut down completely on 11th July 2023.

&quot;We want to thank you all for your support with Lemnis Gate, joining us for many incredible rounds in the loop,&quot; the statement said - the game&#x27;s first Steam update since December 2021. &quot;We&#x27;ve truly loved seeing your passion for the game, the mind-bending strategies you created and how you embraced this innovative twist on the FPS genre.

In a new interview, the game&#x27;s original director Masato Kato and composer Yasunori Mitsuda acknowledged that whilst originally a way to commemorate the RPG&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition also sought to ensure the game would be playable in the future even without backwards compatibility.

&quot;Back when the project was launched, Chrono Cross was possibly going to become unplayable,&quot; remaster producer Koichiro Sakamoto explained in an interview, as spotted by GamesRadar+.

Whilst Spector has not indicated his next steps nor revealed who&#x27;ll be taking over his position, he did confirm his departure on his personal Twitter account, insisting that the franchise would remain &quot;in great hands&quot; with colleagues Aaron Keller and Jared Neuss.

&quot;After 6 amazing years, I’ve decided to hang up my sword and am leaving Blizzard at the end of March,&quot; Spector announced in a Twitter thread (thanks, TheGamer). &quot;Working on Overwatch has been the highlight of my career – Team 4 brings immense talent and passion to their work every day.

                              <span>First-person psychological horror, Someday You&#x27;ll Return, is out now on PlayStation consoles for the first time.

Someday You&#x27;ll Return: Director&#x27;s Cut features haptic controls, &quot;significant optimisation for smoother gameplay&quot;, DLSS support, and better scene lighting in many locations.

There&#x27;s also &quot;more dynamic gameplay&quot; - described as &quot;fewer walking&quot; and &quot;more intense and terrifying&quot; scenes - as well as new puzzles, a photo mode, bug squishing, and a new &quot;hidden game ending&quot;.

                              <span>Resident Evil 4 Remake is reportedly &quot;100 per cent in the wild&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to industry leaker Dusk Golem, who took to Twitter overnight to warn that we should &quot;be careful on social media and video sharing sites&quot; if we&#x27;d like to remain spoiler-free before the game formally releases on 24th March.

&quot;Just as a heads-up, Resident Evil 4 Remake is 100% in the wild, seen some clips people notified me about in a few places. Won&#x27;t share them, but if [you] want to avoid spoilers, now&#x27;s the time to start treading carefully,&quot; Golem tweeted.

                              <span>Red Barrels&#x27; third Outlast game, The Outlast Trials, will release in May 2023.

The co-operative four-player horror game – which some of you may have experienced over the spooky season back in October as part of its closed beta test - will not be getting a full release, however, but instead launch into early access on 18th May 2023.

According to the development team, last year&#x27;s closed beta test provided &quot;insightful feedback and very interesting data&quot;, which has been used to &quot;improve&quot; the game.

                              <span>With several delays now behind it, a release is finally in sight for The Lord of the Rings: Gollum - and ahead of its arrival later this year, developer Daedelic Entertainment has shared a fresh look at its stealthy action in a new gameplay trailer.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is, if you&#x27;re unaware, forging something of a unusual path through Middle-earth, taking its wide-eyed protagonist on an adventure that promises moments of both &quot;subtle tactical stealth&quot; and &quot;fast-paced parkour action&quot; across a mixture of open levels and more linear missions.


It&#x27;s a journey - one set before the events of The Lord of the Rings, chronology fans - that&#x27;ll span some familiar locales,  ranging from the the mountains of Mordor to Mirkwood Forest. And it&#x27;s all shot through with an intriguing branching narrative element that&#x27;ll affect gameplay situations, dialogue, even animations and sound, depending on whether players give prominence to Gollum or the Sméagol side of his personality.

                              <span>Three weeks after Wild Hearts&#x27; arrival, developer Omega Force has released the first free post-launch content update for its wonderful Monster-Hunter-like, this one introducing a new Kemono variant - the Hellfire Laharaback - plus a heap of balance adjustments and fixes.


Hellfire Laharaback is an extremely powerful variant of the base game&#x27;s Lavaback (it&#x27;s officially classed as a Volatile Kemono according to Omega Force, meaning it&#x27;s very much considered end-game content) and arrives as part of a new quest challenging players to &quot;quell the torrid inferno before it reduces everything to ash, and restore tranquility to the island.&quot;


Defeating the Hellfire Laharaback will reward players with the new Fire Fiend Appeaser title, and the chance to acquire the new Infernal Blow skill, which increases the likelihood of setting targets ablaze and boosts the power of attacks against burning targets.

For the most part, today&#x27;s update is focused on fixes, tweaks, and balance adjustments - over 300 in total, according to Dotemu - designed to finesse the already stellar core experience. These range from the addition of new destructible objects around stages to help maintain combo counters, to specific character improvements.


However, there&#x27;re also new co-op-focused moves, including the ability to sling your partner across the screen - at which point they&#x27;re able to hit a button and perform a special attack.

                              <span>In honour of international Mario Day (bafflingly still not officially a public holiday), Lego and Nintendo have announced a fresh collection of Super-Mario-themed sets, including a new take on Bowser Castle and a tease that Donkey Kong is on the way.


Lego&#x27;s Super Mario line launched back in 2020, and has so far seen the release of over 60 interactive, connectable sets - although a number of more complex sets, including Mighty Bowser, have been released outside the Lego Super Mario branding.


For its Mario Day reveal, though, Lego has returned to its Super Mario line, revealing the Dry Bowser Castle Battle set - not to be confused with the already released Bowser&#x27;s Castle Boss Battle expansion, in case you were sure you&#x27;d seen similar before.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a gameplay trailer for veteran Tekken character Paul in the upcoming Tekken 8 and while the famously hard-hitting puncher hits as hard as I&#x27;d hoped, it&#x27;s his hair that&#x27;s caught my eye.


We&#x27;ve known rough and tumble Paul had let his hair down for Tekken 8 since his redesign was unveiled last year, but seeing this new video, below, crystalises how I feel about his do - and it&#x27;s not good. Rather than pore over his moveset (yes, the Deathfist is present and correct), I found myself fussing over Paul&#x27;s fancy locks, which appear to have a life of their own.


Paul has one of the most iconic hairdos in video games. The physics-busting blonde hightop has been a key part of Paul&#x27;s look ever since Tekken exploded onto the scene in 1994.

I finished it once, got my average score of 4000 and something, and then turned in for the night...
... only to discover there&#x27;s a secret difficulty mode this morning?!

                              <span>A new trailer for Professor Layton and the New World of Steam has shown off a neat twist to this surprise puzzle-solving sequel&#x27;s story.


After a long wait for a new entry in the series, New World of Steam will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series&#x27; action to America.


It&#x27;s here that Layton&#x27;s former protégé Luke has been living following the events of 2010&#x27;s The Unwound Future, and where he has since made a name for himself as a local detective. The newly-arrived Layton, meanwhile, is an unknown - and so in this game the usual rookie/pro relationship will be reversed.

                              <span>Sons of the Forest has received its first patch, and let me tell you, it is a thorough one. 


With this update, the Early Access game will now include items such as binoculars and hang gliders. There is also a new mini-boss battle for you to test your mettle against (although, just as a heads up, this patch has also halved shotgun damage, so something to bear in mind if you go in guns blazing).


In addition to the above, a range of other quality of life features have also been implemented thanks to the game&#x27;s first patch. Players will now be able to lock doors, berries have been tweaked to give slightly more fullness and there are a variety of animation improvements.

This impressive recreation comes from Sims 4 builder Isambardy. Taking inspiration from episode three of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation, which focused on survivors Bill and Frank, Isambardy used EA&#x27;s life simulation game to build a condensed version of Lincoln. 
As both a The Last of Us and The Sims 4 fan, I have to say I absolutely love the end result.

                              <span>Forspoken publisher Square Enix has admitted the game&#x27;s sales were &quot;lacklustre&quot;, and that critical reviews of the title had been &quot;challenging&quot;. 


Its underperformance, coupled with that of &quot;many&quot; smaller games also released by Square Enix in the past year, has left the publisher unsure whether it will achieve its previous target of year-on-year financial growth. 


&quot;Reviews of Forspoken... have been challenging,&quot; Square Enix stated in a new financial results presentation. &quot;However, the game has also received positive feedback on its action features, including its parkour and combat capabilities, so it has yielded results that will lead to improvement of our development capabilities of other games in the future.

                              <span>Rapper and producer Curtis &quot;50 Cent&quot; Jackson is developing a TV series named Vice City, a new report has confirmed - but it is nothing to do with Rockstar&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto. 


Jackson set tongues wagging last week when he posted the familiar neon-pink logo for Rockstar&#x27;s Vice City on Instagram and cryptically claimed that &quot;this shit bigger than Power&quot; - a reference to his previous hit TV show. 


That post was later taken down by Jackson, and we now have official word via Deadline that the project simply shares a name with Rockstar&#x27;s much-loved GTA entry.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2 lands today, bringing with it a heavy dose of Asian-inspired architecture from both the past and the future. 


The game&#x27;s Island map has been radically changed via areas themed around ancient temples, as well as a huge neon city location. It&#x27;s here, in this latter area, you&#x27;ll be able to hop on grind rails to get about and shoot while on the move. It&#x27;s this season&#x27;s biggest new gameplay mechanic. 


But there&#x27;s plenty more in store - not least a floating island location which will rift into the sky mid-match.

                              <span>If you haven&#x27;t had your fill of seeing all the many weird and wonderful ways that protagonist Jacob Lee (and, of course, all of those pesky enemies) can die in The Callisto Protocol, I have good news. The game&#x27;s upcoming Contagion Bundle will add 14 new ways for this to happen. Sorry Jacob!


As previously announced, The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Contagion Bundle will add a permadeath mode to the game when it releases on 14th March. It will also see the addition of the Watchtower Skin Collection.


In the meantime, if you are yet to experience all of the death animations that came with The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s launch, you can check out Zoe&#x27;s extensive video cataloguing them below. May I recommend finding a cushion to hide behind before hitting play.

                              <span>Hopefully you&#x27;ve been making good progress on Monster Hunter Rise since its launch on Xbox and PlayStation back in January, because Capcom&#x27;s just announced its stupendous Sunbreak expansion will be hitting those very same platforms on 28th April.


Sunbreak originally released for PC and Switch last June, introducing a wealth of new content to Rise. There&#x27;s the challenging new Master Rank, the new Switch Skills Swap function - enabling players to register two attack loadouts for a quest - plus new area The Citadel.


The latter is a diverse new zone, featuring the likes of lush forests, icy mountains, foggy swampland, and a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece, and arrives alongside a new hub area in the form of bustling port town Elgado Outpost.

Known as the Chainsaw demo, it all kicks off near the beginning of Resident Evil 4, when Leon enters the game&#x27;s mysterious village. And yes, there will be a chainsaw involved. I don&#x27;t want to say I called it, but I totally called it.


In a rather bold move, Capcom has stated there will be no time limit on this demo and you can play it as many times as you like. Below is a little trailer for it all - enjoy!

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s remaster of Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective - the stunning 2011 paranormal puzzle adventure about possessing inanimate objects - finally has a release date and will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam on 30th June.


Ghost Trick, for those unfamiliar, was created by Ace Attorney designer Shu Takumi, and follows the adventures of the strikingly besuited Sissel, who is surprised to wake up as a spirit - and minus his memories - at the start of the game. 


Thankfully, though, while his memories might be missing, his newfound spirit form grants him new abilities, enabling him to possess inanimate objects around the various environments in order to influence events and progress to the next portion of the wonderfully engaging story.

                              <span>At this point, you might well feel like you&#x27;ve already watched a movie&#x27;s worth of trailer for Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming Mario film, but if your hunger remains unsated, the company has coughed up one last trailer ahead of its full release this April.


So far, we&#x27;ve been given a lovely intro to animation studio Illumination&#x27;s cheery interpretation of the Mushroom Kingdom, a giddy second trailer - complete with a roaring Rainbow Road Mario Kart ride - a full scene featuring some wonderfully reworked music, a cat fight, and finally, and perhaps most endearingly, an oddball faux plumbing commercial for the Mario Bros. 


This time around, though, for Nintendo&#x27;s last trailer before release, we get a little bit of everything and, it turns out, a LOT more Rainbow Road. There&#x27;s a caged Luigi (played by Charlie Day), a somewhat unhinged Star Sprite, Seth Rogan&#x27;s Donkey Kong getting the Fire Flower treatment, and a blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it tour of some iconic Mario locales.

As detailed on the PlayStation Blog, The Last of Us Part 1 will feature a full suite of adjustable graphics options on PC, enabling players to tinker with the likes of frame rate caps, texture quality, shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion in their quest for optimal performance.

There&#x27;s also 21:9 Ultrawide and 32:9 Super Ultrawide monitor support, and compatibility with various technologies, including AMD FSR 2.2, Nvidia DLSS Super Resolution, and 3D audio.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has reportedly delayed the launch of Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League once more, moving its release from May to sometime &quot;later this year&quot;.


Suicide Squad - a canonical follow-up to Rocksteady&#x27;s Batman Arkham Knight, playable solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - was announced in August 2021 and expected to release the following year. Last March, however, Warner Bros. made the decision to push its launch into &quot;spring&quot; 2023 to make &quot;the best game we can.&quot;


As this year got underway, Warner Bros. was finally ready to announce a 26th May release for Suicide Squad, but a new report from Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter, claims the publisher is now ditching that date in favour of a new launch &quot;later this year&quot;. Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden made similar claims, saying he was hearing Suicide Squad might be pushed back as far as &quot;Q4-ish&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting more on RoboCop: Rogue City since its announcement back in 2021, today&#x27;s your day. Publisher Nacon has released a new &quot;gameplay overview&quot; trailer and confirmed a launch delay from the previously announced June window into September.


This is Nacon&#x27;s second gameplay video for RoboCop: Rogue City, but given how little actual gameplay was included in the intial one, this latest is arguably the first time developer Teyon (which made the rather wonky Terminator: Resistance) has been able to give a real sense of how things will play out. And that appears to be a mix of first-person gunplay and detective work.


 In the video, we see RoboCop patrolling the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit in search of a suspected drug trafficker. He&#x27;s able to profile ne&#x27;er-do-wells using his fancy gadgetry as he makes his way to the likely scene of the crime - an arcade - and once inside, there&#x27;s an opportunity to do a bit of scan-based detective work, where he uncovers evidence of drug use on the premises before bothering a potential informant at the urinal.

                              <span>Myst developer Cyan Worlds has given its steampunk VR puzzle adventure Firmament a release date, confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for PC and Mac on 18th May this year.


It&#x27;s been quite a wait for Firmament; Cyan Worlds initially announced the game - and released an evocative teaser trailer - all the way back in 2018, promising to take players on a &quot;resplendent, magical, journey&quot; across four diverse worlds, accompanied by an ever-present clockwork companion and a long-dead, ethereal mentor. 


One year later, Cyan launched a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the development of Firmament - which it calls a &quot;deeply immersive narrative adventure game that stays true to the concepts that made the adventure genre great&quot; - and now, following a number of delays (it was initially expected to arrive in 2020), a firm release date is finally here.

                              <span>Here’s a piece of Chinese malware that infects SonicWall security appliances and survives firmware updates.
On Thursday, security firm Mandiant published a report that said threat actors with a suspected nexus to China were engaged in a campaign to maintain long-term persistence by running malware on unpatched SonicWall SMA appliances. The campaign was notable for the ability of the malware to remain on the devices even after its firmware received new firmware.
“The attackers put significant effort into the stability and persistence of their tooling,” Mandiant researchers Daniel Lee, Stephen Eckels, and Ben Read wrote. “This allows their access to the network to persist through firmware updates and maintain a foothold on the network through the SonicWall Device.”...</span>

In my previous article, Forensic container checkpointing in
Kubernetes, I introduced checkpointing in Kubernetes
and how it has to be setup and how it can be used. The name of the
feature is Forensic container checkpointing, but I did not go into
any details how to do the actual analysis of the checkpoint created by
Kubernetes. In this article I want to provide details how the
checkpoint can be analyzed.
Checkpointing is still an alpha feature in Kubernetes and this article
wants to provide a preview how the feature might work in the future.
Preparation
Details about how to configure Kubernetes and the underlying CRI implementation
to enable checkpointing support can be found in my Forensic container
checkpointing in Kubernetes article.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s proposed deal to acquire Activision Blizzard is currently facing regulatory approval around the world, including in the UK where it is under close scrutiny following concerns the deal could be deemed anti-competitive. 


Now, as part of its ongoing campaign to win over the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Microsoft has run full-page Call of Duty ads in both the Daily Mail and the Financial Times. 


The ad (spotted by The Verge) leans into Microsoft&#x27;s recent deals with Nintendo and Nvidia, stating that should the Activision Blizzard deal go through, it will bring Call of Duty to 150 million more players.

                              <span>A pair of entomologists (scientists who study bugs) have named a new species of cockroach they discovered after the Bug and Fighting type Pokémon Pheromosa.
The new species is native to Singapore, and its discovery was reported on by Singapore broadsheet The Straits Times. 
The cockroach was first observed in 2016, when it was collected in a survey at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. After dissecting some specimens and comparing them to known species of cockroaches, the cockroach has been determined to be a new species never recorded before.

Taking a cue from Theme Hospital, Galacticare is a sci-fi hospital management game set in space, with weird aliens and even weirder afflictions.


It&#x27;s due out on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and GOG later this year. Check out the trailer below, just beware there&#x27;s a lot of sick!

Finally, a release date! But later in the year than we&#x27;d hoped for!

Whilst Starfield director Todd Howard talked in front of the camera for the announcement video, what we all really wanted a peek at was the screen lead producer Tim Lamb was using to play the game in the background. Throughout the video, we got brief glimpses at other developers playing and testing Starfield, so you can bet we got our magnifying glasses out to see what details we could spot.

Reportedly, certain members of Ironmace&#x27;s team were &quot;disciplinarily fired from Nexon&quot;, with Nexon claiming they are now &quot;making games using materials and assets they worked on during their time at Nexon&quot; (via This Is Game/Google Translate).

The game made its debut announcement at last month&#x27;s Nintendo Direct  (though only in Japan), and to promote its release Square Enix has shared more details on the game&#x27;s setting and characters.

We already know the game is set in the late 20th century and was developed alongside tourist organisations for Sumida, Tokyo. The game&#x27;s four protagonists have been afflicted by curses, which we now know are related to a set of real urban legends called The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. Aha, I see what you did there, Square.

This latest wave of the expansion adds Birdo, the first new character added to the game, but there are now five empty slots on the character select screen.


In a press release alongside this new wave, Nintendo said: &quot;Two upcoming waves of DLC are still to come, featuring more returning courses and characters from across the Mario Kart series.&quot;

Capcom is set to host its Spotlight showcase later on (10:30pm GMT) across Twitch and YouTube, where it has promised us all another look at upcoming releases Resident Evil 4, Exoprimal, Monster Hunter Rise, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection and Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective.


However, ahead of this showcase, several Twitch streamers have noticed an ad for the Resident Evil 4 remake&#x27;s demo, which ends with the words &quot;demo available now&quot;.

                              <span>The latest system update for PlayStation 5 has added a slight change which makes it easier to play the digital version of a game if you own the disc, and vice versa.
Previously, the disc and digital versions of a game were considered separate entities but this has been unified in the latest update.
Now, you can play the digital version of a game installed on your PS5 by inserting the disc, without having to install the disc version. This also works for any digital games other users sharing your PS5 have installed, which you have the disc for.

                              <span>If your interest was piqued by the unveiling of developer PlatinumGames&#x27; striking Bayonetta spin-off Cereza and the Lost Demon during last year&#x27;s Game Awards, you might want to hop over to Switch&#x27;s eShop, where a demo is now available.

 
Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, as the prequel is officially known, follows the fairytale-inspired adventures of Cereza - the child version of adult Bayonetta introduced in the series&#x27; first game - and her demonic companion Cheshire.

 
The pair embark on a genteel action-adventure rendered in the style of an illustrated storybook, in which players do a spot of platforming, solve puzzles, and occasionally battle creatures across the perilous Avalon Forest - using the left stick to control Cereza and wield her magic and the right to unleash Cheshire&#x27;s might.

The original Wargroove released back in 2019, giving starved Advance Wars fans a solidly entertaining, gorgeously presented slab of turn-based strategy action - featuring a few new tactical twists, such as unit synergies - with a splash of Fire Emblem fantasy thrown in.


A free (and sizeable) co-op-focused expansion, Double Trouble, launched in 2020, and now, a little over three years later, Chucklefish has revealed a follow-up is on the way.

                              <span>Microsoft has told the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) it&#x27;s confident Activision Blizzard can optimise Call of Duty to run on Switch after the regulatory body raised concerns around the console&#x27;s &quot;technical limitations&quot;.


As part of its ongoing efforts to convince regulatory bodies in the UK, EU, and US to approve its $69BN USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard - which has so far been blighted by concerns it may choose to make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox, hampering PlayStation&#x27;s ability to compete - Microsoft signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo guaranteeing it would bring the FPS to Switch.


However, in its Provisional findings report published last month, the CMA said it was unable to place &quot;material weight&quot; on Microsoft&#x27;s agreement when considering the proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, as there was &quot;no certainty [the deal would] lead to CoD becoming available on Nintendo&quot;. Elaborating further, it highlighted the &quot;technical limitations&quot; that &quot;would need to be overcome for Call of Duty to become available for Nintendo Switch.&quot;

                              <span>UPDATE 6.14pm: Microsoft has responded to Sony&#x27;s suggestion it could deliberately introduces bugs and errors into Call of Duty to make it unplayable on PlayStation, reiterating it has made a &quot;guarantee of parity between Xbox and PlayStation on access to Call of Duty&quot;.


In a statement provided to Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson said, &quot;Since the CMA issued its Provisional Findings, we have offered solutions which address its concerns and increase the deal&#x27;s benefits to UK players and game developers. These include a guarantee of parity between Xbox and PlayStation on access to Call of Duty and legally binding commitments to ensure that Call of Duty is available to at least 150 million more players on other consoles and cloud streaming platforms once the deal closes.&quot;


Referencing its proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard more generally, Microsoft added, &quot;The decision now lies with the CMA on whether it will block this deal and protect Sony, the dominant market leader, or consider solutions that make more games available to more players.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has announced it&#x27;ll be holding this year&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase on 11th June.


That isn&#x27;t, of course, particularly surprising news; Microsoft has long favoured the pre-E3 Sunday slot for its big announcements showcase, and it&#x27;s one it&#x27;s clinging onto even after reports it won&#x27;t be participating in this year&#x27;s E3.


As to the specifics of its showcase, Microsoft isn&#x27;t saying much right now, only that it&#x27;ll run ahead of a special Starfield-focused Direct at some currently unspecified time.

The aptly named School Spirits DLC will see Two Point Campus&#x27; students &quot;whisked off&quot; to Lifeless Estate, where &quot;the lawn may be lacklustre, and the surfaces strangely gooey, but all of the problems come back to the ghosts&quot;.   


Here, students will be able to take part in two new courses and encounter &quot;spirited new student archetypes&quot;. There will also be a spooky assortment of new items to fill your campus with. How fa-boo-lous!

Starfield was initially due to release last November, but, in May, Bethesda announced it was delaying the game&#x27;s launch into the &quot;first half of 2023&quot; to &quot;ensure that [players] receive the best, most polished&quot; version.


Now, though, with rumours of a further delay continuing to swell around the internet, Bethesda has confirmed Starfield will now arrive in the second half of 2023, on 6th September.

A lot of ground was covered, but some key takeaways from this discussion surrounded Dark and Darker&#x27;s monetisation model and the developer&#x27;s approach to cheaters.


On the monetisation front, Ironmace has promised there will be &quot;absolutely no&quot; pay-to-win elements included within the game, and its model will be one that &quot;players can understand&quot;.

Dream of the Beast adds two new original songs to Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s stellar music line-up, alongside a new weapon and three new outfits (Angel Eyes, Morning Star, and Dark Devotee), each with their own unique gameplay modifiers. 


On the song front, The Outsiders have signed up Lacuna Coil&#x27;s Cristina Scabbia and Lorna Shore&#x27;s Will Ramos to provide vocals for the new compositions which, as with Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s other tracks, have been written by Two Feathers.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher Take-Two has confirmed reports of layoffs at the company, calling the job losses &quot;necessary steps&quot; as it seeks to &quot;position the company for another extended period success.&quot;


Reports of layoffs at Take-Two first surfaced via Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who claimed the move would impact employees at Take-Two&#x27;s Private Division - the publishing label behind the likes of OlliOlli World and Kerbal Space Program - and other unspecified parts of the company.


Take-Two acknowledged it had laid off staff - but did not confirm affected divisions or the number of employees impacted - in a statement provided to PC Gamer, saying it had made &quot;targeted reductions in our US teams, primarily in corporate operations and label publishing&quot; that would have an &quot;minimal&quot; impact on its US development studios.

                              <span>Exactly one month after it announced its previous Xbox wireless controller variant, Microsoft is back with another, this one fully adorned in Xbox&#x27;s &quot;signature&quot; green.


Officially, Microsoft is calling this latest controller release Velocity Green, which joins a line-up of other flat-colour variants including Pulse Red, Deep Pink, and Electric Volt.


Feature-wise, it&#x27;s exactly as you&#x27;d expect from an Xbox controller, with textured grip for bumpers, triggers, and rear, along with a &quot;hybrid&quot; D-pad, Share button, and 3.5mm jack.

                              <span>Lince Works, the studio behind enjoyable stealth-action games Aragami and Aragami 2, has announced its imminent closure following what it calls a &quot;particularly difficult&quot; couple of years.


Lince Works was founded in 2014 and released its debut title, Aragami&#x27;s first instalment, two years later. It proved successful enough that a sequel arrived in 2021, and the studio revealed it had started focusing on &quot;brand-new adventures&quot; in September last year.


Now, however, in a message shared on Twitter, Lince Works has announced it will &quot;effectively stop the development of new projects indefinitely, starting this April.&quot;

Peridot, which was announced last April, is Niantic&#x27;s spin on Tamagotchi-like virtual pets, tasking players with caring for and breeding their colourful digital charges into adulthood.


&quot;Our team has been hard at work making Peridots real,&quot; creative director David Hollin explained in a blog post announcing today&#x27;s release date news. &quot;They are immersive, amazing magical creatures that eat, sleep, play with toys, explore their environment, get bored, develop unique personalities, and are always in need of a loving adopter like you.&quot;

                              <span>Playdate - the dinky yellow gaming handheld with a crank and some nifty games - is getting an on-device store known as Catalog and an imminent $20 USD price increase.


Catalog, which Playdate creator Panic describes as a &quot;boutique digital on-device and web based storefront&quot;, arrives today and marks something of a departure for the company, which has so far only distributed Playdate games through a seasonal release model.


With the arrival of Catalog, however, players can purchase individual titles on-demand either directly from their Playdate or via the Catalog website. 16 games and apps will be available at launch - 11 of which are brand-new - and Panic says it&#x27;ll be expanding the curated selection over time. It also assures owners it&#x27;ll remain possible to sideload and purchase Playdate games and apps from other storefronts such as Itch.io and Gumroad.

                              <span>Twitch has addressed the livestreaming of explicit deepfake content on its platform in a new safety blog post.



It follows an incident in January in which explicit fake content of female streamers was live streamed on Twitch. 


&quot;This moment caused immense distress to those whose images were used without their consent, and set off a wave of conversations about the dangers that AI-generated explicit imagery can pose,&quot; reads the blog post from Twitch.

As well as these little titbits, there was also accompanying media of a Battle Pass character, that fans have stated is likely named Thunder.

That&#x27;s based on physical retail sales, per data from GfK courtesy of the Entertainment Retailer&#x27;s Association Yearbook (thanks GamesIndustry.biz). For digital downloads, the average selling price was £15.19, a rise of 7.3 percent over last year (from data firm Omdia).



Since 2017, the average selling price of games has risen by 12 percent.

However, not content with just booting the offending parties out of their games, the Escape from Tarkov team has taken things one step further and compiled a spreadsheet of all the cheaters it has booted out. It has then shared this document with the public (if you want to scroll through it for yourself, here it is).


As reported by TechCrunch (via PC Gamer), Battlestate Games said it recently banned 6700 cheaters and added all of their nicknames to this document.

                              <span>Microsoft has promised more &quot;consistency&quot; with Halo Infinite seasonal updates, as its third season launches today.


As shared on Xbox Wire, 343 Industries&#x27; head of live performance Sean Baron discussed the future of seasonal updates.



&quot;In our preview of Season 3, I said that this is the beginning of what seasonality is for Halo Infinite. But &#x27;seasonality&#x27; is restrictive. To me, seasonality is really about consistency - we need to be consistent in everything. I feel very confident with where we&#x27;ve gone with Season 3, and I have very strong confidence that we&#x27;re going to be able to keep improving that consistency, and avoid, completely, the long seasons of the past,&quot; he said.

An ARG is an augmented reality game, and this one in particular covers the events just before Resident Evil 4 begins. It serves as a little bite size prequel, if you will. 


Known as &quot;Baby Eagle Is Missing&quot;, this ARG tasks players with solving a handful of puzzles that will help locate the US President&#x27;s daughter, Ashley Graham (who is codenamed &quot;Baby Eagle&quot;).

                              <span>Rovio could reverse its decision to de-list Angry Birds from the Google Play store.


At the end of February, the mobile publisher removed the original Angry Birds game from the store due to its business &quot;impact&quot; on the publisher&#x27;s other games. On iOS, the game was renamed to Red&#x27;s First Flight.


Now, in a statement to Axios from a senior executive at the publisher, Rovio could reverse its decision to remove the game - or if the change is successful it could remove it from iOS too.

                              <span>There was a bit of confusion last week, when it was announced that The Super Mario Bros. Movie would be released two days earlier than previously expected in the US and &quot;60 other markets&quot;. At this point, it was unclear whether the UK fell into the &quot;other markets&quot; category.


Now, however, Universal has cleared that up, and stated The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be released on 5th April in the UK. This is the same as in the US.


If you&#x27;ve been struggling to keep track of when The Super Mario Bros. Movie is due to arrive, you are not alone. After all, Universal has shunted its release date around the calendar on numerous occasions.

                              <span>A bug in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is causing players to lose their save files, thanks to the latest patch.


It&#x27;s unclear exactly what the cause is, but many fans on reddit (thanks Kotaku) are reporting the error after connecting to the Pokémon Go app or downloading the DLC.


The reddit thread is full of players losing hundreds of hours of gameplay and shiny Pokémon, some from merely purchasing the DLC.

                              <span>The most recent episode of The Last of Us broke another viewership record for the series.


As reported by HBO, episode eight was watched by 8.1 million viewers on its debut across &quot;HBO Max and linear telecasts&quot;.


For those keeping track, that is a 74 percent increase from the show&#x27;s pilot episode.

                              <span>Microsoft has claimed the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority has significantly overcounted the potential impact of Call of Duty going exclusive to Xbox and PC.


The CMA has been sceptical about Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn bid to purchase Activision Blizzard, most recently stating it could harm UK gamers, resulting in &quot;higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation&quot;. It believes players would abandon PlayStation for Xbox.



However, based on a YouGov survey commissioned by Microsoft back in January and shared with Axios, just three percent of all PlayStation users would switch to Xbox if Call of Duty became exclusive.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is - can you believe it? - five years old this month, and to celebrate its half-decade anniversary, developer Rare is ushering in a new quality-of-life-focused season all about reinvigorating the piratical multiplayer adventure&#x27;s core sandbox.


Sea of Thieves&#x27; Season 9 - which launches next Thursday, 16th March, just ahead of the game&#x27;s 20th March anniversary - is somewhat unusual in that it isn&#x27;t really built around one single flagship new feature. Instead, it&#x27;s tweaking, finessing, and refreshing the game as a whole in a bid to create a more coherent, enjoyable experience after five years of disparate updates.


For starters, come the new update, all World Events - from ship battles to Ashen Lords - will dynamically scale to match different crew sizes. Additionally, emergent event - the kraken, megaladon, fog, and ship wrecks - have been adjusted to make them a more common occurrence after having all become increasingly seldom seen as updates have continued.

Little has been shared about Life By You beyond a brief teaser trailer, but it&#x27;s being developed by Paradox Tectonic, the Humble-run studio unveiled back in 2019.


At the time of Paradox Tectonic&#x27;s establishment, Humble said the studio would focus on creating &quot;open, fun, beautiful games which respect the players&#x27; intelligence and enables their creativity, freedom, emotion, and sharing&quot;, and we&#x27;ve now got our first look - albeit brief - of what the team has been working on since then.

                              <span>As part of today&#x27;s announcement bonanza, Paradox Interactive has officially unveiled its long-awaited city builder sequel Cities: Skylines 2, which is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 at some point &quot;later this year&quot;.


Cities: Skylines 2 is being developed by Colossal Order and promises a &quot;revolutionary&quot; spin on the studio&#x27;s acclaimed 2015 original, giving players the tools to &quot;build any kind of city they can imagine and follow its growth from a humble village to a bustling metropolis&quot;.


How Cities: Skylines 2 will differ from its predecessor in more specific terms, beyond a shiny new facade, is currently unclear, but Paradox says the game - which it calls the &quot;most open-ended city-building sandbox on the planet&quot; - will enable players to &quot;create and maintain cities that come to life like never before.&quot;

As its name suggests, Tours and Tournaments has something of a focus on outdoor pursuits, and will, for intsance, let players host grand demonstrations of feats of arms around the map - an activity that&#x27;ll attract nearby nobles and wandering knights, and potentially boost social standing or military prowess along the way.


Players&#x27; best knights can also be honoured with special titles and accolades that grant bonuses to both them and the armies they lead.

As part of a recent Discord Q&amp;A, which was subsequently shared on Steam, the developer was asked if Redfall would support crossplay between Steam and its Game Pass version. 


The answer was a yes. &quot;You&#x27;ll definitely be able to play with your friends on Steam,&quot; Arkane replied.

                              <span>Harebrained Schemes, the studio behind the acclaimed likes of Shadowrun and Battletech, has announced The Lamplighters League, a pulp-inspired tactical turn-based strategy game heading to PC and Xbox Series X/S in 2023.


The Lamplighters League - or rather, The Lamplighters League and the Tower at the End of the World to give it its full name - is described as a original pulp adventure set in an alternate 1930s. It&#x27;ll pit players against a nefarious global cult, the Banished Court, out for global domination.


&quot;For millennia,&quot; Harebrained explains, &quot;all that stood between this sinister cabal and their plans was a band of heroic scholars known as the Lamplighters League. Unfortunately, the best of the best are all gone, so now it&#x27;s up to the best of the worst.&quot;

                              <span>This is a good survey on prompt injection attacks on large language models (like ChatGPT).
Abstract: We are currently witnessing dramatic advances in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). They are already being adopted in practice and integrated into many systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and search engines. The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting. Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed filtering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following. So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM...</span>

                              <span>Kerbal Space Program 2 has had a rocky launch. 


On the space-flight simulator&#x27;s release in Early Access, many found the game unplayable due to a collection of bugs and frame-rate issues. At this time, many reviewers on Steam suggested players stick to the original Kerbal Space Program game until the developer irons out some of the kinks plaguing its sequel. 


And, well, it looks like many are doing just that, with Kerbal Space Program 2&#x27;s player count already dropping below its predecessor&#x27;s numbers in recent days.

Those shoes are worn by Faith, the protagonist of Mirror&#x27;s Edge.

After last week&#x27;s episode further established Ellie&#x27;s motivations, episode eight - &quot;When We Are In Need&quot; - brings us back to the present day, and Joel and Ellie&#x27;s ongoing plight to find the Fireflies. 


This episode stays remarkably faithful to its source material while continuing to put a spotlight on character development, and as always leaves plenty to discuss. Without further ado, let&#x27;s crack on.

There are several different versions to consider, although the pricing structure is a touch convoluted – here&#x27;s how it breaks down…

                              <span>Get set, Counter-Strike fans – it looks like a new version of CS:GO – possibly called Counter-Strike 2 – could be on the way.

As there&#x27;s been no formal word from Valve, Steam, or anyone else for that matter, all we can do right now is chalk this up to either a mistake, a hoax, or a hilarious misunderstanding. If a recent NVIDIA leak is correct, however, and executable files called &quot;cs2&quot; and &quot;csgo2&quot; have indeed been discovered, a beta could launch as soon as later this month. 

Alongside a curious tweet from noted Counter-Strike leaker @gabefollower, which unveiled the curious additions to the NVIDIA driver update, journalist Richard Lewis has also stepped up to confirm that &quot;a new version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive [is] on its way&quot; and reckons it is &quot;almost certainly set to be released under the working title of Counter-Strike 2&quot;.

It’s one thing to say that we need to secure our cloud infrastructure, and another to detail what the means technically, who pays for it, and who verifies that it’s been done.

                              <span>PlayStation has been ordered to refund Austrian FIFA players after a court ruled that FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) packs are a form of gambling.

As reported by Games Wirtschaft and spotted by VGC, a court in Hermagor ruled that the football game&#x27;s FUT packs violated the country&#x27;s gambling laws. 

According to lawyer Ulrich Salburg, the plaintiffs - which include one minor - had allegedly &quot;gambled away&quot; hundreds of euros on FUT packs when the uncertain monetary value of the packs purportedly violated the Austrian Gaming Act. Consequently, the court alleged that the controversial loot boxes could be classified as &quot;illegal gambling&quot;.

The free-to-play football game is celebrating the milestone by offering a &quot;commemorative campaign&quot;, as well as giving away Neymar Jr and some in-game currency to anyone who logs in between now and 30th March.

Log in every day, however, and you can receive up to 10 coins a day, up to a total of 280 eFootball coins. Score a goal with Neymar Jr in the next fortnight – from now until 16th March – and you&#x27;ll get more coins, Game Points, and XP, and the same applies if you score with Lionel Messi between 16th and 30th March.

According to a Reddit Q&amp;A session as spotted and transcribed by PC Gamer, the team has &quot;big plans&quot; for Kelvin, including expanding the tasks he can complete - including fortifying the base. Endnight also intends to develop Virginia&#x27;s AI so that she&#x27;ll take on intruders with &quot;more bravery&quot; if you were altruistic enough to hand over one of your firearms.

&quot;We have big plans to keep adding tasks Kelvin can complete, some ideas in progress are having are having him help construct a wall around your base, or fortify/repair the base when needed,&quot; the team said.

As spotted by GyoJvbfr and XboxSquad.fr (thanks, Windows Central), it looks as though the toaster is set to release later this year, but is currently available to pre-order for residents of France and Belgium.

Schaefer will take on the position of chief creative officer alongside industry stalwarts, Peter Hu and Phil Shenk, where he&#x27;ll be &quot;leading the creative direction&quot; of the studio&#x27;s unannounced action-RPG.

Schaefer has established four studios in his time – Blizzard North, Flagship Studios, Runic Games, and Double Damage Games – and co-created the first two Diablo games alongside other critically-acclaimed games like Torchlight and Rebel Galaxy.

                              <span>Ubisoft is reportedly &quot;working on a strategic reorganisation of its European business subsidiaries&quot; that may include shuttering some of its European offices.

Unsubstantiated reports first surfaced on ResetEra, where a poster shared part of an email that purportedly detailed plans to &quot;close a number of subsidiaries&quot;, including the closure of Ubisoft Benelux. 

Eurogamer understands this reorganisation relates to Ubisoft&#x27;s business offices rather than game development studios. In a statement to NME, Ubisoft refused to &quot;share&quot; any more details given that the &quot;process is ongoing&quot;, but did say: &quot;Ubisoft’s publishing group is working on a strategic reorganisation of its European business subsidiaries&quot;.

                              <span>Less than a year after Meta ramped the price of its Meta Quest 2 VR headset up by $100, the company is slashing prices back down - albeit only on the 256GB model and only by $70 - starting this Sunday, 5th March. It&#x27;s also discounted its pricey Meta Quest Pro by $500.


At the time of last year&#x27;s price hike, Meta insisted the increase was necessary as &quot;the costs to make and ship our products [have] been on the rise&quot;. Now, though, it&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s dropping the price of Meta Quest 2&#x27;s 256GB model from $499.99 USD to $429.99 in order to &quot;let even more people feel the joy of fully immersive games and experiences&quot;.


The price drop goes into effect this Sunday in a select number of territories - specifically, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, and the US - and will mean there&#x27;s now only $40 price difference between the 128GB and 256GB models. Meta hasn&#x27;t shared the updated prices in local currencies as yet.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s ambitious The Duviri Paradox expansion - which was originally slated to arrive last year before getting delayed into 2023 - is finally almost upon us, with developer Digital Extremes having now confirmed it&#x27;ll be launching this April. And while you&#x27;ve got your diary out, it&#x27;s also announced a date for this year&#x27;s TennoCon so you might as well jot that down too.


The Duviri Paradox, if you&#x27;ve not been keeping up with the news, introduces Warframe&#x27;s fourth open-world area - following the Plains of Eidolon, Orb Vallis, and the Cambrian Drift - and plunges players into the fantasy-western-themed world of Duviri, most notable for the fact it exists inside the mind of the expansion&#x27;s new big bad, Dominus Thrax.


Beyond its distinctive setting, The Duviri Paradox also features a striking stark black and white aesthetic (with the world slowly blooming into full colour over time), a new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees Digital Extremes &quot;flirting with rogue-like elements&quot;, and, for good measure, a fancy skeletal horse steed.

                              <span>If you had high hopes of hunkering down for a spot of Wii U Mario Kart 8 or Splatoon multiplayer this weekend, there&#x27;s some bad news: Nintendo has pulled both games offline while it addresses a security vulnerability, with no hint as to when servers may return.


Nintendo took both games offline at 4.30am this morning in the UK, and confirmed the downtime on its server status page, explaining, &quot;This network service is currently unavailable due to urgent maintenance required to fix a vulnerability related to online play.&quot;


As noted by VGC, Nintendo dataminer OatmealDome has suggested the security issue affecting Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon is likely to be ENLBufferPwn - a vulnerability common to network code present in a number of first-party Nintendo games that makes it possible for a hacker to connect to another player&#x27;s device and remotely execute code.

                              <span>Team Ninja has released a statement addressing issues PC players are facing with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.
The hotly-anticipated action game released earlier today and had garnered plenty of interest with its demo. Alan Wen gave the game a recommended badge in his review on PlayStation 5, but performance on PC seems to be hit-and-miss.
At time of writing, Wo Long is in the top five best-sellers on Steam. The game peaked at 75,906 concurrent players on the platform earlier today (as recorded by SteamDB), making it one of Team Ninja&#x27;s most popular games on PC.

We&#x27;ve already been introduced to protagonists Liko and Roy, as well as Captain Pikachu and his partner Friede.

As well as the protagonists, we also get a glimpse of a new character, and which other Pokémon we can expect to see in the series.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a new first-person mod for the original Dead Space, which raises the classic sci-fi survival horror&#x27;s scares to a whole new level. 


When I initially saw this mod, I questioned its value. Dead Space has one of the cleanest HUDs of any game, and its ability to view Isaac Clarke&#x27;s health and Stasis module via the back of his suit remains inspired.


That said, a first-person view - where you are unable to see enemies approach from behind and have to mentally keep track of damage - is surely even scarier.

Jack Black, the voice of Bowser, may have promoted a little more than he had anticipated in a recent appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show - and ended up having his crotch blurred.


Black appeared with co-stars Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, and Keegan Michael-Key in a series of videos uploaded to YouTube by the official channel for The Kelly Clarkson Show. The others showed up in smart casual fashion, whilst Black was &quot;tricked&quot; by the others into dressing up as his Mario movie counterpart.

As with all GBA games, you&#x27;ll need to be a subscriber of the Nintendo Switch Online service&#x27;s pricier Expansion Pack tier to be able to play it.


Developed internally by Nintendo, Metroid Fusion is beloved for its classic side-scrolling Metroid gameplay. Upon its launch back in 2007, Eurogamer&#x27;s editor at the time Tom Bramwell described it as his &quot;favourite 2D Metroid yet&quot;.

                              <span>Square Enix plans to replace its current CEO Yosuke Matsuda, with a motion on his departure set to be voted on by shareholders in June.


Matsuda has served as CEO for decade, during which time the company has seen a mix of fortunes. Square Enix&#x27;s western studios have been sold off, its high-profile Marvel&#x27;s Avengers project failed to find success, and most recently its Japan-made blockbuster Forspoken flopped.


The company has lined up Takashi Kiryu, a young exec who joined Square Enix in 2020, as Matsuda&#x27;s replacement.

                              <span>Ubisoft is aiming to drum up some additional interest in last year&#x27;s excellent Mario + Rabbids sequel Sparks of Hope with a new two-hour demo, available now on Switch.


Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope was well-recieved by critics when it launched at the end of last year, drawing praise for a solid evolution of its wonderfully engaging 2017 predecessor, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, that melded exemplary XCOM-like strategy action with expanded puzzles and more open-ended exploration.


Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan liked Sparks of Hope enough to slap it with a Recommended badge in his review, calling it &quot;knockabout XCOM fun in a galaxy-hopping adventure&quot;.

Mojang says it&#x27;s chosen the name as it &quot;represents the journey that Minecraft takes us on, and the unique stories that each of us bring back&quot;, and because its additions are all about &quot;self expression through representation, story telling, and world building.&quot;


But while Trails &amp; Tales&#x27; name might be new, details of the features it&#x27;ll bring are not, with Mojang having already delved into the update&#x27;s various additions in some significant detail.

                              <span>Long-in-the-works open-world zombie shooter Dead Island 2 is finally - after eight years and multiple delays - almost upon us, and in anticipation of its 21st April arrival, publisher Deep Silver has just shared 14 new minutes of combat-focused gameplay.


This latest airing follows Dead Island 2&#x27;s slightly odd showcase in December - which buried a few juicy snippets of gameplay amid a heap of largely uninformative live-action sequences - but the focus this time is on gameplay from beginning to end.


Deep Silver&#x27;s latest gameplay reveal picks up in Bel Air, just a few hours into the game, as players - having selected Dani as their Slayer of choice - attempt to navigate LA&#x27;s sun-kissed (and zombie-infested) streets in search of the Halperin Hotel evacuation point.

Call of the Sea - which originally released toward the tail-end of 2020 - whisks players back to 1934, as protagonist Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One&#x27;s Cissy Jones) investigates a beautiful South Pacific island in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a captivating, often ingenious blend of story, exploration, and puzzling that successfully that manages to hits some powerful emotional beats, even as it tips into cosmic weirdness. Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese described Call of the Sea as a &quot;dazzlingly different debut with a haunting sense of place and adventure&quot; in his Recommended review.

The project is being developed in conjunction with Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour Interactive and Atomic Monster (the production company run by prominent horror director James Wan), with the latter calling the game&#x27;s &quot;incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains...perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation&quot;.


There&#x27;s no writer or director attached to the adaptation yet - the companies are &quot;commencing their search&quot; for both - but Blumhouse says it&#x27;s &quot;imperative we find someone who appreciates and loves the world as much as we do, to help us bring the game to the big screen&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal looks set to pass EU regulators, news agency Reuters has now reported. 


Citing sources familiar with the deal, the report claims that Microsoft has won over the European Commission with its show of concessions last week, when it announced deals to ensure Call of Duty would be made available on Nintendo platforms and Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce Now streaming service.


The EU is set to publicly state its final judgement on the case before 25th April.

Unfortunately, some other pretty good games will be leaving to make room for the anticipated release.

                              <span>Frontier Developments is making its F1 racing management sim - the aptly F1 Manager 2022 - free to try this weekend on Steam.


F1 Manager 2022 - the first of four games planned for release under Frontier&#x27;s F1 licensing deal - launched last August, putting players in the role of a team principal and challenging them to lead their &quot;drivers, engineers and fans to glory in the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Drivers&#x27; World Championship and FIA Formula 1 Constructors&#x27; World Championship&quot;.


While it adequately filled enough of a niche to draw a positive response at launch, players quickly began to criticise the game for its shallow, undercooked features and a significant number of bugs - but any hopes of major improvement were quickly quashed when Frontier announced it was ending support for the game less than two months after launch.

                              <span>Yuji Naka, the former boss of Sega&#x27;s Sonic Team, has reportedly admitted a charge of insider trading over the ownership of shares worth around £865k.


In December last year, Naka was accused of violating financial laws after it was reported that he had purchased a large number of shares in Japanese mobile developer ATeam while employed at Square Enix.


It was alleged that Naka had done so in the knowledge ATeam was working with Square Enix on mobile game Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier - a fact which had not been made public.

The presentation, which was shared with The Verge, contained details on Quest 3 as well as two more headsets and Meta&#x27;s AR development projects.


Speculation of a Quest 3 release sometime soon was fuelled recently by the news that Meta is ending support for its original Quest VR headset, with the company continuing to deliver security patches until 2024.

The collaboration is the first in a series called PlayStation Playmakers, which PlayStation&#x27;s head of global marketing Eric Lempel described as a partnership with &quot;passionate PlayStation fans who also happen to be some of the most exciting creators, atheletes, actors, artists, gamers, and entertainers in pop culture today&quot;.


Lempel described James as a &quot;natural fit&quot; for PlayStation Playmakers, and recalled James&#x27; appearance with his son Bronny in that one God of War trailer with Ben Stiller as Kratos.

Sony has emerged as the acquisition&#x27;s key opponent, and Microsoft is hoping this ruling will allow it to gain leverage with the US regulator ahead of its own judgement. 


A judge has now ruled that  Microsoft can view Sony&#x27;s communications with regulators about the Activision deal, as well as details of Sony&#x27;s own exclusivity agreements with game publishers since 2019.

The sequel was discussed before the release of the first game and, should it perform well, a third game would be likely, Asmussen told IGN.

The Wolf Among Us 2 - the sequel to Telltale&#x27;s acclaimed 2013 narrative adventure based on Bill Willingham&#x27;s Fables comic books - has had an eventful development. It was first announced in 2017, but progress halted after the studio shut its doors the following year. It was then unexpectedly re-announced in 2019, after Telltale was resurrected under new management.


This new version - which is being co-developed by AdHoc Studio, co-founded by original Wolf Among Us co-director Nick Herman, and made up of almost 50-percent former Telltale employees - was initially expected to launch in 2023, but Telltale has now pushed the game&#x27;s release into next year, as detailed in a statement shared on Twitter.

                              <span>Developer Sloclap&#x27;s acclaimed martial arts adventure Sifu will - after a year of PlayStation and Epic Games Store exclusivity - be making its way to Xbox and Steam on 28th March.


Sifu, if you&#x27;ve not yet had the pleasure, is a third-person, single-player action game - focused on intense hand-to-hand combat - that charts a young Kung Fu student&#x27;s quest for revenge following the murder of his family. It also features a magic pendant capable of resurrecting the protagonist on defeat, but he&#x27;ll grow older with each revival, making its uses finite - but at least you get to keep any unlocked skills for another attempt.


Sifu was extremely well-received when it launched last February, but some players found its extremely tough challenge a little too much to handle. Pleasingly, though, Sloclap took feedback on board and added new difficulty options several months in - and has continued updating the experience with new modifiers, systems, and outfits since.
