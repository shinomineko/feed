                              <span>Viking survival game Valheim now has difficulty options, so you can make the experience a little easier - or more difficult, if you prefer. 


Developer Iron Gate Studio has said it hopes these options will encourage potential players previously put off by Valheim&#x27;s sometimes unforgiving nature to give the game a go. 


As you&#x27;d expect, hard mode buffs enemy HP and damage output. Easy mode, as Iron Gate puts it, caters to those seeking &quot;a lighter, more accomodating adventure ideal for the pacifists and builders&quot;.

From indie developer Brightrock Games, Galacticare is a management game that tasks players with running a hospital in space teeming with alien life - and alien afflictions.


As announced a couple of months back, the game is set for release this year on PC (Steam and GOG), PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles, plus it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass.

This means a delay of around a year from Flintlock&#x27;s previously-expected &quot;early 2023&quot; arrival.


Set to release for PC, PlayStation and Xbox, this &quot;magic meets gunpowder technology&quot; fantasy action RPG made an impression when it was shown at the Xbox Games Showcase 2022. (Chalk this up as another title not to make that showcase&#x27;s &#x27;released in the next 12 months&#x27; promise).

Mod team member Isatris has now created a mod that adds Hunter weapons and armour from Bloodborne into the demo of the pinocchio Soulslike (thanks PCGamesN). The integration, visually at least, is a harmonious blend.


It&#x27;s not quite Bloodborne on PC, though, as much as fans might be thirsting for it. The mod only changes outfits so Lies of P gameplay remains intact - don&#x27;t expect any guns!

Speaking to Axios, Xbox Game Studios chief Matt Booty said Arkane would remain open. &quot;That is the plan right now,&quot; he said.


&quot;They are hard at work on updates and continued content for Redfall,&quot; Booty continued, saying he wanted to &quot;support them to be able to keep working to deliver the game they had in mind&quot;.

Partner Plus is a benefit for existing Partners, offering the 70 percent revenue split on subscriptions that many streamers have been requesting for a long time but Twitch itself has denied.



The response from streamers to this news, however, has been mostly negative.

Speaking to The Wrap, Chris Meledandri - who founded Illumination back in 2007 - said he didn&#x27;t know where this Legend of Zelda report came from.

Often simply referred to as Fire Emblem, this was an important entry in Nintendo&#x27;s long-running RPG series - the very first to be released in the West. 


Originally launched in Japan back in April 2003, it finally reached European shores in July 2004, and began the franchise&#x27;s journey to becoming a household name on these shores.

                              <span>Moving Out, the knockabout co-op removals game from developer SMG Studio, is getting a sequel - complete with the likes of online cross-play multiplayer for the first time - and it&#x27;ll be launching on 15th August for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.


The original Moving Out arrived back in 2020, reimagining the process of furniture removals in much the same chaotic way Overcooked reimagined culinary creation. And while the end result wasn&#x27;t &quot;quite as good&quot; as its obvious inspiration, as Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan suggested in his review at the time, it was &quot;still very special&quot;.


A extremely solid foundation, then, for more to come, and Moving Out 2 builds on the original by whisking the Furniture Arrangement and Relocation Technicians (F.A.R.Ts) &quot;beyond the realms of their dimension&quot; and into a succession of &quot;wildly different&quot; universes.

                              <span>Rockstar Games co-founder and creative director Dan Houser, who parted ways with the Grand Theft Auto developer in 2020, has formally unveiled Absurd Ventures, a media company established to create new IP across &quot;all platforms and formats&quot;.


Not much has been heard from Houser since his departure from Rockstar following an &quot;extended break&quot;, but rumblings of a return emerged last year when it was discovered he&#x27;d registered companies Absurd Ventures and Absurd Ventures in Games in both the US and UK.


And now, Houser&#x27;s new project has been officially revealed, with Absurd Ventures being described as a media company with a focus on &quot;building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium&quot;.

                              <span>Two and a half years after the launch of its Xbox Series X/S consoles, Microsoft has officially said goodbye the previous generation, with Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty now confirming no internal development team is working on new titles for Xbox One.


Booty shared the news in conversation with Axios, revealing all 23 of Microsoft&#x27;s internal Xbox studios - aside from those specifically working on support for ongoing games like Minecraft and Sea of Thieves - have now &quot;moved on to Gen 9&quot;. 


Despite that shift in focus, Booty says the company still plans to &quot;maintain support&quot; for Xbox One by making its Gen 9 titles - that is, games designed specifically for Xbox Series X/S - playable on the older platform via its cloud streaming technology.

                              <span>Fans of flamboyant fisticuffs are in for a bit of a treat over on the Epic Games Store this week; developer Drinkbox Studios&#x27; acclaimed Metroidvania-style twosome Guacamelee 1 &amp; 2 are currently free to download and keep.


The first Guacamelee (technically styled Guacamelee!, but the exclamation mark is a bit much), released in 2013, serving up a colourful mix of wrestling-inspired brawling and non-linear exploratory action, in which protagonist Juan Aguacate, suddenly infused with luchador powers, set out across a fantasy world inspired traditional Mexican culture and folklore to rescue El Presidente&#x27;s kidnapped daughter.


&quot;Like the best luchadores in the business,&quot; Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan wrote at the time of its release, &quot;Guacamelee has real heart and a blazing desire to put on a good show.&quot;

                              <span>A logo seemingly pointing to an unannounced remaster of Square Enix&#x27;s sci-fi action-RPG sequel Star Ocean: The Second Story has been discovered on the publisher&#x27;s website.


The unassuming asset in question, found squirrelled away on Square Enix&#x27;s support site (and which you can peruse at your leisure over on RPGSite), features a logo for a presumably unannounced title going by the name Star Ocean: The Second Story R.


While Square is yet to utter the name publicly, it&#x27;s not hard to conclude it references an unannounced remaster, given it uses the same naming convention as Star Ocean: First Departure R. That game, which released for Switch and PlayStation in 2019, was a remaster of 1998 PlayStation Portable game Star Ocean: First Departure (itself a remaster of the 1996 Super Famicom original), introducing the likes of difficulty rebalancing and new character art.

The game is from German indie developer Tiny Roar and will be published by Daedalic, with an Early Access release on PC sometime this year.


Wanderful is a builder-explorer game players take at their own pace, with a bright and squidgy art style. Check out the demo trailer below.

These editions were previously announced for Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console back in October 2021 as part of the series&#x27; 25th anniversary, but were quietly delayed at the end of last year. 


The two games now come together, as The Lara Croft Collection. Anyone interested in taking to the tombs with her ladyship can pre-order the game now via the Nintendo eShop. The collection will cost £20, $25 or €25, depending on where you are.

Its latest hotfix, from 12th June, makes &quot;further adjustments to elite monster density in dungeons&quot;.


A developer note adds: &quot;We are standardising the density of elite monsters that spawn in dungeons to ensure that no particular dungeon is clearly more efficient to run through than others.&quot;

                              <span>Ever since Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released, players have been flexing their creative muscles by building a host of weird and wacky designs. This has included mechs, trucks, tanks and Korok torture devices. Someone even built a pilotable T-rex, because why not.


A month on, however, these in-game designs have evolved even further, and we are seeing Zonai-crafted orchestras and functioning calculators turn up in the game. 


As a quick reminder, Link&#x27;s new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects to create something completely new and unique.

                              <span>You thought the summer conference season was over? Nope, it&#x27;s still going - and early this morning included a presentation from No More Heroes developer Grasshopper Manufacturer. 


Aired at 5am UK time, the 11-minute video offers little in the way of actual updates amongst its silliness. We get another trailer for the upcoming Shadows of the Damned Remastered and, right at the end, the sneakiest of peeks at what&#x27;s next from renowned game maker Suda51.


Looking closely at the gameplay footage (which Suda51 pretends to block to stop us seeing more), there&#x27;s a UI which shows health, blood and &quot;emerald flowsion&quot;. One of the weapons equipped is named &quot;Brynhildr&quot;.

                              <span>The New York Times is beta testing a game called Connections which has gained attention for its similarities to a round featured in BBC2 quiz show Only Connect.


In both games, players are shown 16 clues which must be categorised into four groups of four. Once a category is correctly identified, the clues are grouped together at the top of the board and asasigned a colour.


The only notable difference is that Connections refreshes each day and players can only make four mistakes (akin to Wordle), whilst in the Connecting Wall (as it&#x27;s known on Only Connect) players must solve the wall in two and a half minutes. Connecting Wall players have unlimited guesses until they&#x27;ve found two categories, after which they are only given three incorrect attempts.

                              <span>Steam has now officially added a host of handy new features to its client, following earlier beta testing.


This update sees the arrival of a redesigned in-game overlay, complete with new features, a notes function, pinnable in-game windows and improvements to notifications.


The ability to pin windows from the overlay means they appear on top of a game while you are still playing. This feature, the company has said, is available for Notes, Guides, Discussions, Achievements, and the web browser, so  is ideal for those &quot;multi-tasking maniacs who love to have a movie on in the background while they game&quot;.

It&#x27;s used the terminology of Closed Network Test previously, with Elden Ring for instance, but for Tekken 8 it&#x27;s created a logo with CNT on it.


It&#x27;s certainly raised some eyebrows among fans.

Speaking with Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation&#x27;s head of subscriptions Nick Maguire said putting games on to the service &quot;a bit later in the life cycle&quot; is working for Sony. Therefore, this will &quot;continue to be [its] strategy moving forward.&quot;


&quot;We&#x27;re happy with our strategy,&quot; Maguire told the publication. &quot;Putting games in a bit later in the life cycle has meant that we can reach more customers 12, 18, 24 months after they have released.&quot;

                              <span>Yakuza developer RGG Studio has released a statement to clear up confusion over the title of the next mainline game in the series.

When Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth was revealed at last week&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, many (myself included) believed it was a completely new game being announced in the series, and not the sequel to 2020&#x27;s Yakuza: Like a Dragon. 

However, following subtle rewording of its marketing for the game, RGG Studio and publisher Sega explained that Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is actually the title for Like a Dragon 8, which was initially announced under that name in September last year.

More specifically, Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s online stress test - which NetherRealm says is designed to &quot;deliberately stress our online infrastructure and identify potential issues&quot; ahead of launch - will run from Friday, 23rd June at 4pm BST/8am PDT through Monday, 26th June at the same time.


The test is open to Xbox Series X/S and PS5 players in North America, Latin America, Brazil, and Europe, but places are limited. Participants will be chosen at random from those who&#x27;ve registered on the Warner Bros. website, and registration is still open if you want to get involved.

                              <span>Well, here&#x27;s a surprise! Just when it looked like it would be all hands on deck until the arrival of Sea of Thieves&#x27; hugely anticipated (by me, I am the huge anticipant) Monkey Island crossover, developer Rare has announced it&#x27;ll be reviving the multiplayer pirate game&#x27;s limited-time Adventure series next week after a three-month absence.


Sea of Thieves&#x27; Adventures were introduced early last year in an effort to create meatier, more interesting monthly content drops, with the idea being each would form a playable instalment in an ongoing narrative. It&#x27;s been fun following along, even if their quality has varied wildly (and even if they resulted in the sacrifice of moustachioed seahunk Arthur Pendragon, which is a crime I will never forgive), but then Rare suddenly announced it would be temporarily &quot;hitting the pause button&quot; on Adventures back in March.


Whatever the reason for the pause (presumably the impending arrival of a certain G-brush), Rare is finally ready to resume monthly Adventures, starting with next week&#x27;s A Dark Deception, which runs from Thursday, 22nd June to Thursday, 6th July.

                              <span>People Can Fly, the studio behind Bullestorm and Ourtriders, has formally signed a work-for-hire agreement with Microsoft to develop a new project based on one of the Xbox maker&#x27;s IP.


The announcement come via a statement posted to Polish financial site Interia Biznes, in which People Can Fly notes the game, which has been given the codename Project Maverick, will be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m.


As to what the mystery project could be, the most obvious guess would be some form of new entry in the Gears of War series given the studio&#x27;s previous connections with the franchise - it co-developed Gears of War: Judgment alongside its previous owner Epic Games in 2013, and was responsible for the Windows port of the original Gears of War prior to that.

                              <span>Dead Cells - the superb rogue-like action-platformer from Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire - is being turned into an 10-episode animated series for release next year.


The series is the work of Paris-based animation studio Bobbypills - the team behind Dead Cells&#x27; animated trailers, as well as Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon spinoff, Captain Laserhawk - and whisks viewers away to a cursed island ravaged by a strange plague. 


&quot;After the island&#x27;s foolish king develops a remedy that ends up turning the population into monstrous creatures,&quot; the official announcement explains, &quot;prophecies depicting a flame-headed hero begin to appear. As it so happens this beheaded hero is real, but saving a kingdom isn&#x27;t on his schedule and he just wants to be left alone.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a year since Sony relaunched its PlayStation Plus subscription service with multiple tiers, and today there&#x27;s word of an upcoming new feature: PS5 game streaming.


There&#x27;s no release date as yet, just word that Sony is &quot;testing&quot; the technology for select PS5 titles, including those in the subscription&#x27;s game catalogue, and others you may own. 


And to be clear, this will be a Premium tier benefit - so you won&#x27;t get it if you&#x27;re on regular old PlayStation Plus Essential or Extra.

                              <span>I liked the look of Last Train Home when it got its unveiling this week during not-E3. It&#x27;s a wintery period piece from Czech studio Ashborne Games, based on real events following World War 1. 


With the Great War over, you command a legion of Czech soldiers on a train bound for home via the Trans-Siberian railway. Their aim is to get back to the newly-created republic, but along the way there&#x27;s trouble - the Russian Civil War.


Real-time battles are interspersed with management of your soldiers while aboard the train - which can of course be upgraded as you journey through Siberia - making sure your units are in good health and well fed.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida previously told Eurogamer that Game of Thrones was a major influence on the upcoming game - something that&#x27;s now apparent from the many references to the series already obvious from the game&#x27;s freshly-released demo.
&quot;We wanted to create something that really resonated with a lot of people,&quot; Yoshida said previously. &quot;And when we saw how Game of Thrones, and before that the Song of Ice and Fire series, has really resonated with players, we knew that this was something that we wanted to do as well.&quot;


The development team were required to watch the Game of Thrones Blu-ray boxset in order to keep the series&#x27; style front-of-mind - something that is now apparent more than ever. Did George RR Martin secretly pop over to the Square Enix office while writing lore sheets for Elden Ring?

                              <span>Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver have given us a peek at Dead Island 2&#x27;s upcoming content.


In a new update, the team has unveiled two upcoming expansions. The first of these, known as Haus, will be released in Q4 of this year. 


&quot;How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?&quot; the Dead Island 2 team asks. Why, with a &quot;techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore&quot;, of course.

                              <span>Ready yourselves. Goosebump-inducing ghost hunting sim Phasmophobia is headed to PlayStation 5, including VR2, and Xbox Series X/S. 


The game will release across consoles in early access this August, although a specific date has not yet been announced. Developer Kinetic Games has, however, teased some of what console players can expect.


A new trailer gives a look at the various ghost hunting tools that will be in our arsenal, including ouija boards, crucifixes and those blacklight glow stick things that I am sure have a proper name but I can&#x27;t think of it right now. It is all suitably spooky, as you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>Diablo 4 players are adamant there&#x27;s a secret cow level in the game, even though Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson has denied its existence.


In an interview with Kinda Funny from May, Fergusson said people should not spend time looking for a secret level that wasn&#x27;t there. &quot;We really wanted to ground [Diablo 4] as much as possible,&quot; he said.  
&quot;We&#x27;ve had some fun, but we wanted to make sure it felt authentic to the gothic, dark themes we had. And because of that, there&#x27;s no secret level in Diablo 4 that people might be looking for, as per previous games.&quot;

                              <span>2K&#x27;s unannounced Lego football game has popped up on the Korean game ratings website. 


It&#x27;s called Lego 2K Goooal! (with three O&#x27;s). 


The game&#x27;s existence was first leaked last year by VGC, which reported the title as being developed by UK studio Sumo Digital, of Sonic Racing and LittleBigPlanet 3 fame. Now, the game has leaked again, via the ever-reliable Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea (thanks, Gematsu).

Sea of Stars was previously revealed to be coming to Xbox consoles in August this year (in addition to Switch, PC and PlayStation). Now it&#x27;s confirmed to be coming to Game Pass on day one too.



Then there&#x27;s Aggro Crab&#x27;s Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure, which is headed to all Xbox consoles and PC via Game Pass (alongside Switch and PC) when it releases in early 2024.

Speaking with The Burnettwork, former Titanfall designer Mohammad Alavi shared the story of this &quot;crazy cut&quot; in his career. 


&quot;Titanfall 2 came out, did what it did, and we were like &#x27;OK, we&#x27;re going to make Titanfall 3&#x27;. And, we worked on Titanfall 3 for 10 months in earnest. We had the tech for it, and multiple missions going,&quot; Alavi revealed.

Word of the FTC&#x27;s intent to file an injunction first broke on Monday this week. The development blocks Microsoft from making any kind of move on Activision Blizzard, and brings the matter to a federal court. 


The FTC had previously set its own date for the deal to be debated by an internal administrative judge on 2nd August - after Microsoft&#x27;s own deadline to complete the merger on 18th July expires.

Gabe Amatangelo, game director and VP of the studio, further confirmed at which point the expansion unlocks and revealed there will be a new ending of the base game.


&quot;No, this takes place in the midst of [Cyberpunk 2077],&quot; Amatangelo told WCCFTech. &quot;You get to a certain point in the game and this unlocks, but of course, we let you skip right to it much like it was done in The Witcher 3&#x27;s expansions.&quot;

Summer Game Fest is currently in its fourth consecutive year - having initially started amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as a response to major in-person gaming events being shut down - and 2023&#x27;s offering has been bigger than ever.


It was, of course, originally expected to have some competition from the returning E3 this year, but after that show&#x27;s cancellation, Summer Game Fest swelled to fill the gap, hoovering up a number of publisher showcases and events under the Summer Game Fest banner.

                              <span>It&#x27;s finally almost time to ready your nozzles and prepare for a trip to the briny depths: PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s SpongeBob SquarePants DLC has a release date, and is launching for Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 29th June.


PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack was announced back in May but, beyond its Bikini Bottom setting, developer FuturLab didn&#x27;t give much away.


Now, though, with a release in sight, the studio is finally ready to share more, confirming its Spongebob DLC will feature a mini campaign split across six new maps: Conch Street, The Bikini Bottom Bus, The Krusty Krab, The Patty Wagon, The Invisible Boatmobile, and The Mermalair.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait for developer Slow Bros&#x27; gorgeous stop-motion-style space adventure Harold Halibut - but now, some seven years after its initial reveal, an end is in almost sight, with its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC release set for &quot;early&quot; next year.


Harold Halibut tells the story of a young lab assistant (the Harold of the title) forced to live his life onboard the Fedora, a city sized spaceship still submerged beneath an alien ocean 250 years after it fled Earth to preserve the human race.


While some of its inhabitants have reconciled themselves to a life on the sunken ship, others still works tirelessly to find a way to leave the planet and reach a new, dryer home. Harold&#x27;s story lies somewhere between all that, told in absolutely sumptuous style, part fully voiced stop-motion movie, part narrative-driven adventure.

                              <span>Shadowrun and Battletech studio Harebrained Schemes&#x27; extremely promising pulp-inspired tactical turn-based strategy adventure, The Lamplighters League, now has a release date, and is launching for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass on 3rd October.


The Lamplighters League unfolds in an alternative version of the 1930s, where players - taking control of the titular organisation&#x27;s gang of misfits and scoundrels - travel the world in an effort to thwart the Banished Court cult&#x27;s nefarious schemes.


It&#x27;s an adventure that&#x27;ll swoop from dockyards and other urban corners to far more exotic locales, including deserts and jungles. Here, players must battle the Banished Court&#x27;s army using a mix of real-time infiltration, stealth, turn-based tactical combat, and team management.

                              <span>Tango Gameworks&#x27; sublime rhythm-action adventure Hi-Fi Rush is getting a great bit dollop of free new content on 5th July, including two new modes, new photo mode features, and more.


Everything included in Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s new Arcade Challenge update (as it&#x27;s officially known) will only be available after beating the base game. Once that&#x27;s done, a new arcade cabinet is added to the hideout, unlocking the new BPM Rush and Power up! Tower up! modes.


BPM Rush presents players with a series of encounters where the beat gets faster and faster as enemies are defeated, gradually rising all the way up to 200BPM. Tango notes that while this new addition is really designed for players in search of a tougher challenge, it&#x27;ll actually feature an Easy and Casual difficulty setting too so everyone can give it a try.

                              <span>Acclaimed heavy metal rhythm shooter Metal: Hellsinger is taking a tilt toward pop in its new Essential Hits Pack DLC, which launches today on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s FPS action, if you&#x27;ve not yet made its acquaintance, sees players traversing eight musically infused Hells, armed with a blade and an appropriately devastating assortment of guns. The twist, though, is enemies take way more damage when an attack lands on the beat, turning its demon slaughter into wonderfully satisfying dance of bullets and steel.


To date, all music in Metal: Hellsinger and its earlier DLC has been firmly in the realm of heavy metal and written specifically for the game. However, its newly revealed Essential Hits Pack DLC sets its sights on a different crowd, taking things in a poppier direction with eight licensed tracks that can replace the base game&#x27;s existing tunes.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re back to wrap up the end of a tiring but intriguing week of Summer Game Fest and not-E3 announcements, which offered us the usual mixed bag of presentations, CG trailers, and the occaisonal musical interlude.

What were our favourites? There was a real variety of things on offer, from Dont Nod&#x27;s Jusant and Compulsion&#x27;s stylish-looking South of Midnight to blockbusters like Star Wars Outlaws and Fable. And then, of course, there was the inescapable Starfield - which after nearly a full hour deep dive I still feel like we&#x27;ve only seen a small portion.
Microsoft did well, I thought. Ubisoft did pretty good. Capcom... put in an appearance to delay Pragmata. But what were our favourite games on offer, and how convinced were we by Todd Howard&#x27;s marketing spiel? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

Silicon Valley has produced no small number of moral disappointments. Google retired its “don’t be evil” pledge before firing its star ethicist.

But while Nix is adorable and I&#x27;ve taken to calling him my land axolotl, the character that really caught the internet&#x27;s attention was a certain droid commando, ND-5. Twitter, Tumblr, I&#x27;ve seen you.
The reactions to ND-5 I&#x27;ve seen are mostly &quot;friends, please don&#x27;t be horny for the Star Wars droid&quot; or &quot;friends, I am horny for the Star Wars droid&quot;. You either get it or you don&#x27;t. So please, let me at least try to explain why the internet is horny for the Star Wars droid.

                              <span>Video game mega publisher Embracer, which this morning announced a &quot;comprehensive restructuring plan&quot;, says it must now &quot;exploit&quot; the fact it owns the rights to Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit &quot;in a very signficant fashion&quot;. 


Speaking via an investor call held in the wake of today&#x27;s announcement that it would restructure the company, Embracer&#x27;s newly-promoted interim exec Matthew Karch said the business must now prioritise pumping out Lord of the Rings projects ahead of other game ideas which might not perform as well. 


&quot;We own Lord of the Rings, and we know we need to be exploiting Lord of the Rings in a very significant fashion and turning that into one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world,&quot; Karch said. &quot;And that&#x27;s obviously something we&#x27;re going to be doing.

                              <span>Netflix is yet to air the first episode of its Tomb Raider animation, but it already looks to have renewed the series for a second season.


Additionally, it appears that Ncuti Gatwa - star of Sex Education and the upcoming Fifteenth Doctor in Doctor Who - will join the cast.


As reported by What&#x27;s on Netflix, Gatwa will voice Eshu, a new character for the franchise. Gatwa&#x27;s Spotlight profile has been updated to include this role under the casting site&#x27;s &#x27;further&#x27; section.

                              <span>Microsoft Game Studios head Matt Booty has said Starfield, at present, has fewer bugs than any other Bethesda game at launch.


Booty appeared on the Giant Bomb podcast with Xbox boss Phil Spencer to discuss the Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct.


&quot;We have an awful lot of people internally playing it,&quot; said Booty. &quot;Working with Todd and the team, I see bug counts and just by the numbers, if it shipped today, this would have the fewest bugs that any game from Bethesda has ever shipped with.&quot;

                              <span>BioWare has removed a bizarre statue of Mass Effect&#x27;s dying Commander Shepard from its online store, following fan confusion and upset.
The statue appeared on the BioWare Gear Store yesterday, and features (yes, you guessed it) the dead female body of Commander Shepard floating around in space as seen in the opening to Mass Effect 2. The statue was priced at $135 and its store page stated only 2000 would be available worldwide.
Needless to say, a statue suddenly being sold that depicts a dying character is a bit odd to begin with. The posing of FemShep is also a bit much - why the slightly arched back? Out of context, it looks a bit like Shepard&#x27;s death is being sexualised and fetishised. And why only FemShep? What about if I want a statue of male Shepard limply floating about?

                              <span>Blizzard has laid out more of its plans for Overwatch 2&#x27;s Invasion update, which is due to arrive this August. This includes a paid-for add-on that includes &quot;permanent access&quot; to three story missions, which will cost $15.


As a quick recap, Blizzard has promised &quot;new Story Missions, an all-new PVP core game mode, new ways to build on your skills with your favourite heroes... and a new Support hero&quot; for Overwatch 2: Invasion. 


These story missions will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Gothenburg, with each location featuring &quot;massive maps&quot; and &quot;complex objectives&quot;. Players will find themselves taking on the series&#x27; Null Sector group, with the story set to continue in future seasons of the game.

                              <span>Embracer has announced a &quot;comprehensive restructuring program&quot; which will result in studio closures, project cancellations and job losses.


The Swedish umbrella company has grown enormously through acquisitions over the past five years, and now owns a swathe of studios such as Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics, Borderlands maker Gearbox, rights to franchises such as The Lord of the Rings, and an array of other publishers such as Plaion, Saber and THQ Nordic.


But while amassing its empire, Embracer is yet to see a big return. Last year&#x27;s big bet, its Saints Row reboot, was a critical and commercial failure. More recently, the company suffered a body blow when a major unannounced $2bn deal fell through, prompting its shares to plummet by an eye-watering 40 percent.

Ghost Trick, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, comes from Ace Attorney designer Shu Takumi and follows the adventures of Sissel, a sharp-dressing amnesiac who&#x27;s surprised to wake up extremely and unequivocally dead at the start of the game.


On the plus side, Sissel&#x27;s quickly learns his newfound spirit form grants him the ability to possess inanimate objects, enabling him to influence events and, in gameplay terms, progress to the next portion of Ghost Trick&#x27;s wonderfully told story.

Much like Phoenix Attorney: Ace Attorney Trilogy, the Apollo Justice Trilogy will also feature an updated UI and hi-resolution artwork.

The mysterious project was first announced with a bizarre teaser back in 2020, when it was set for a futuristic-sounding 2022 launch. A year later, that release date was pushed back to 2023. And now, in 2023, it has been further delayed - this time, to a year unknown.


Tonight, during the Capcom Showcase, the publisher confirmed we&#x27;d need to wait longer once more - though we did get another teaser beforehand. You can watch that below:

                              <span>Arkane Austin has released a first major patch for its widely derided co-op vampire shooter Redfall, promising &quot;incremental improvements&quot; across a range of areas including gameplay, combat, and AI - but its promised 60fps mode for Xbox Series X is still nowhere to be seen.


Redfall released to a less-than-stellar reception back in May, with Digital Foundry calling the Xbox version a &quot;sad tale of unfulfilled potential and profound technical issues&quot;, while its PC counterpart was so hampered by poor performance, technical problems, and bugs, Digital Foundry&#x27;s Alex Battaglia said there was the sense it &quot;just isn&#x27;t finished&quot;.


Launch was bad enough that Xbox boss Phil Spencer took the step of apologising to players, admitting, &quot;We let a lot of people down this week&quot;, leaving many to wonder how - and if - Arkane Austin could turn things around.

                              <span>US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly set to file an injunction with a federal court in an effort to temporarily halt Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


The FTC sued to block Microsoft&#x27;s proposed deal back in December, claiming it would allow the company to suppress its games industry competition. The hearing for that case - which will be deliberated by the FTC&#x27;s own internal administrative law judge - is set for 2nd August, after Microsoft&#x27;s 18th July merger deadline expires.


As reported by CNBC, citing a source familiar with the matter, the FTC is now taking steps to prevent Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard deal from going ahead before its internal hearing can take place, by filing for an injunction with a US District Court.

                              <span>XDefiant, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Tom-Clancy-inspired free-to-play shooter, is holding its first Open Session test later this month on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.


XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division - was initially announced as Tom Clancy&#x27;s XDefiant back in 2021, but Ubisoft chose to drop the Tom Clancy branding after criticism from fans that felt its flamboyant action strayed too far from the franchise&#x27;s more serious military themes and formula.


Development has quietly continued since then, with Ubisoft occasionally opening XDefiant up to registered &quot;insiders&quot; to canvas feedback, and a recent closed beta finally brought the game into the hands of a much broader audience, with over 1m players ultimately getting to spend some time with its first-person shooting action.

Now that the Ubisoft Forward presentation has come to a close, it&#x27;s time to go over everything that was shown during this trailer-filled summer showcase. It included a variety of updates for upcoming games and a selection of reveals - all of which you can find below with their accompanying trailer. 
Below you&#x27;ll be able to take a look at Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, among many other titles, ending with our first glimpse at gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws.
Ubisoft Forward began with the trailer for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, which will be released on 7th December 2023:

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward has given us a closer look at the trio of Assassin&#x27;s Creed titles set to launch in 2023, including the Baghdad-set Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, VR title Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus and smartphone entry Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Jade.


We began with a look at Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus, which is due to launch for Meta Quest 2. Tonight provided our first real detail of the game, including the fact it will star three of the series&#x27; best-loved protagonists: Ezio, Kassandra and Connor.


Nexus will boast a &quot;full single-player campaign&quot;, Ubisoft said, with an Abstergo-set modern day threat revolving around the evil tech company trying to use people&#x27;s memories to sway their behaviour - and even their voting preferences. It&#x27;s perhaps a bold choice of narrative for a game set to be played on Mark Zuckerburg-branded hardware.

                              <span>Almost exactly two years to the day of its original announced, Netflix&#x27;s exuberant animated Far Cry adaptation, Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, has received its first trailer.


Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix comes from series creator and writer Adi Shankar - who helped bring Netflix&#x27;s acclaimed Castlevania adaptation to life - and is described as a &quot;love letter from the 90s&quot;. 


Unless its story has changed dramatically since its unveiling in 2021, it all takes place in parallel version of Earth where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data. Enter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier, who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before sailing off into the sunset with his boyfriend Alex.

Accompanying this news, Ubisoft shared a gameplay overview trailer for the upcoming release. It transports us to the franchise&#x27;s never-before-seen Western Frontier, and covers things such as skill upgrades, mounts (you will be able to tame your own banshee) and introduces some of the game&#x27;s new Na&#x27;vi clans. 


It all looks rather Far Cry (our Na&#x27;vi has weapons training) with a dash of Horizon Forbidden West, if you ask me, but I will let you judge for yourself below.

Pay attention to the techniques:
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing...</span>

                              <span>Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, the fantastical stealth-strategy pirate adventure from Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blade of the Shogun studio Mimimi Games, is launching for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 17th August.


Shadow Gambit&#x27;s top-down tactical action - which should be immediately familiar to fans of Mimimi Games&#x27; previous titles - unfolds in a &quot;dynamic, immersive sandbox&quot; given an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. It sees players climbing board their living ghost ship, The Red Marley, to explore the Caribbean in an alternative version of the Golden Age of Piracy.


As they set out in search of the legendary Captain Mordechai&#x27;s lost treasure, with the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden in pursuit, they&#x27;ll gradually acquire a crew of cursed pirates with supernatural powers that can be assembled into teams for use in missions around the world.

                              <span>There&#x27;s light at the end of the not-E3 Summer Games Fest 2023 conference tunnel, but still enough time for Uncle Yves to uncork his content pipe and provide us with an update on everything Ubisoft.


We likely know the full schedule for tonight, with two just-revealed titles set to get a more thorough showing. Those, of course, are Star Wars Outlaws from Division studio Massive, unveiled last night at Xbox Games Showcase, and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which we got a glimpse of at Summer Game Fest. 


It&#x27;s a Ubisoft show, so there&#x27;ll be some Assassin&#x27;s Creed. We&#x27;re looking forward to seeing more of the upcoming back-to-basics Mirage, and potentially some of VR game Nexus and Ancient China-set mobile entry Jade. Then there&#x27;s likely to be Forza Horizon-like The Crew Motorfest, plus the latest release date for Skull and Bones.

                              <span>Last night, developer Compulsion unveiled its new game South of Midnight, and introduced us to its heroine, Hazel. 


Hazel is a Weaver, a &quot;magical mender of broken bonds and spirits&quot;. Compulsion has described her as &quot;outwardly confident, wisecracking, and actively on the hunt&quot;. Hazel is also Black, something that narrative producer and creative specialist James Lewis lamented is &quot;unfortunately... still pretty unique for video games&quot;. 


Thankfully, the South of Midnight developer has ensured its Black heroine was created by Black women and women of colour, calling this inclusion &quot;key for understanding and writing Hazel&#x27;s voice.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft and developer Asobo have moved to assure Microsoft Flight Simulator players the current 2020 release will continue to receive updates after yesterday&#x27;s announcement of a &quot;standalone sequel&quot; shed doubt the companies would continue their long-standing pledge to provide 10 years&#x27; worth of support for the current game.


Microsoft Flight Simulator head Jorg Neumann initially spoke of the studio&#x27;s plans to support the 2020 version of the sim for a decade back in 2019, a year prior to its release, and it&#x27;s a stance that&#x27;s been reiterated intermittently ever since. As such, there was much confusion among fans following last night&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase reveal of a standalone sequel for 2024 - particularly as Neumann had already hinted at some of its flagship new features, including cargo delivery jobs, in relation to the current sim.


Now though, in an effort to quell confusion and de-escalate mounting controversy, Neumann has offered clarification on continued support for the 2020 release in a FAQ posted on the Flight Simulator website, beginning with the reiteration that Flight Simulator 2024 is a &quot;standalone simulator and the next-generation sequel&quot; and not an update for the existing game.

The reveal sparked immediate comparisons to BioShock Infinite from many viewers, thanks to its setting, combat, characters, enemy designs...

The similarities did not escape the eye of Twitter user Butmac, who said they produced the trailers for BioShock Infinite which were released in the run-up to the game&#x27;s launch in 2013.

                              <span>Everyone knows the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol is the Muppets version - and there&#x27;s no way this can be beaten. Still, if you&#x27;re looking for another oddball take on Ebenezer Scrooge, there&#x27;s a new adventure for the Victorian miser now on the horizon. 


Ebenezer Scrooge and the Invisible World is a side-scrolling platform adventure with something of a Doctor Who Christmas special to it, while the art style gives me vibes of Forgotton Anne. 


Scrooge - acting here as the protagonist and good guy - must jump and fight his way across London to fight wealthy industrialist Caspar Malthus, a press release reveals, using &quot;a team of spectral allies&quot; to fight Malthus&#x27; own private guard.

                              <span>Capcom has made a selection of its retro games playable in-browser to celebrate the company&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

The games can be found by visiting Capcom Town, a website set up specifically for the anniversary and which was first teased back in March.

The site acts as a hub for all the different franchises Capcom owns, and you can hover over all the pins to find links to websites for each. There&#x27;s also plenty of Capcom&#x27;s most famous characters dotted around - I&#x27;m particularly enjoying watching Jill Valentine strolling around in horror as she&#x27;s followed by Nemesis and his huge rocket launcher.

Persona 3 was re-released as Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable: the former included a new playable epilogue, while the latter included a new female protagonist, the ability to directly control party members, and other major changes.


However, this won&#x27;t be included in Reload as the development team focus on &quot;recreating the Persona 3 experience&quot;.

                              <span>A free and extensive update for Vampire Survivors is available today. Developer Poncle shared this news during the PC Gaming Show last night, revealing update 1.5 will introduce players to a new stage known as Astral Stair. 


The team has dubbed this stage as &quot;chaotic&quot;, and I can understand why. This level will see players coming face to face with &quot;seemingly endless corridors, flying paintings&quot; and, my personal favourite, &quot;a gameshow-like spinning wheel that triggers random events&quot;. 


There is also a new pick up known as GoldFinger, and if you didn&#x27;t read that and immediately start singing Shirley Bassey then, I am sorry, but I am not sure we can remain friends. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.

                              <span>The Banner Saga trilogy developer Stoic has announced Towerborne, a side-scrolling co-op action adventure for PC and Xbox, coming next year. 


This is the project previously referred to internally as Project Belfry, and was revealed in the Xbox Games Showcase last night as coming from both Stoic and Xbox Game Studios. The suggestion is it won&#x27;t be coming to other consoles. 


After some new apocalypse razes humanity&#x27;s cities, survivors accumulate in the Belfry, a towering windmill that looks like something from the Moomins.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 will be available to play today in demo form, Square Enix has confirmed. 


The highly-anticipated demo will go live for PlayStation 5 in the UK at 9am - that&#x27;s 4am Eastern time or 1am Pacific.


The demo will contain &quot;two lengthy sections&quot; showcasing Final Fantasy 16, beginning with the game&#x27;s opening prologue. A PlayStation blog update states this will likely last you around two and a half hours, and will give you a look at main character Clive&#x27;s backstory.

On Xbox Series X, it will run at 4K resolution. On Xbox Series S, it will run at 1440p. 


Speaking to IGN, Howard said Starfield sometimes ran at 60fps in development on console, but that Bethesda had taken the decision to lock its framerate because &quot;we prefer the consistency&quot;.


&quot;I think it&#x27;ll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,&quot; Howard said. &quot;Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen.&quot;

In a post-event roundtable in Los Angeles attended by Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell, Booty said that Microsoft&#x27;s output was entering a new era.


&quot;We had some gaps last year, but I think we&#x27;ve turned the corner coming into 2023,&quot; Booty said. &quot;[I] feel very good about launching Hi-Fi Rush, we have Minecraft Legends out there which is doing well, we have Age of Empires continuing to come to console... and then as we saw today, this fall we have Forza Motorsport and Starfield.&quot;

Things are a little bit different this time around, with Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector introducing a brand-new - and steadily declining - Sleeper android protagonist, alongside a new setting where players will need to build themselves a life among the starts.


This particular Sleeper has been hiding out in the Starward Belt at the edge of the Helion System, and, having rewritten their own code in an effort to escape servitude, is now on the run with a malfunctioning body, a bounty on their head, and no memory of their past.

Though a sequel to the popular, icy city-builder was announced back in August 2021, an official release window was never announced.

There were the steampunk machines, the gleaming statues and overhead skyrails, the alternate history Americana. The first-person visuals and chunky golden guns didn&#x27;t help things either. 


But no, this is the completely legally distinct Clockwork Revolution, from Wasteland 3 developer InXile Entertainment, and this &quot;vibrant steam-powered metropolis&quot; is named Avalon.

                              <span>Colossal Order&#x27;s eagerly awaited city building sequel Cities: Skylines 2 has had a big news day! Not only has the developer shared a first gameplay trailer, it&#x27;s announced a 24th October release date on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


Publisher Paradox Interactive officially unveiled the sequel back in March, calling it a &quot;revolutionary&quot; spin on the acclaimed 2015 original and the &quot;most open-ended city-building sandbox on the planet&quot;. Other than talk of a &quot;fully-realised transport and economy systems&quot;, however, specifics remained pretty thin.


Courtesy of tonight&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, though, we&#x27;ve now had our first proper look at Cities: Skylines 2 in action, with Colossal Order showing off a sequel that notably ramps up the realism, in terms of visuals at least.

                              <span>The Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct 2023 has come and gone! Over the course of nearly two hours, we saw a huge variety of Xbox titles, including new reveals and updates for ones already on the slate, and, most importantly, we also got a detailed look at Starfield.
Outside of Starfield, highlights included South of Midnight, Star Wars Outlaws, Avowed, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and a new trailer for Fable (though still no release date). Many of the games shown will also be available from Game Pass from day one.
The show began with the Fable trailer narrated by Richard Ayoade, AKA Dave - a giant-sized vegetable enthusiast. While a release date and final name are yet to be annouced, this upcoming addition to the Fable series will of course be available on Game Pass from day one:

In Phantom Liberty, players will be travel to Dog Town, an &quot;all new district&quot; of Night City, where they have to rescue the president of the New United Stated of America. CDPR describes Phantom Liberty as a &quot;spy-thriller&quot;, with Reeves telling us to expect &quot;twists, secrets and plenty of stuff to do&quot;.

                              <span>Atlus and the creators of the Persona series revealed its next game at the Xbox Games Showcase: Metaphor ReFantazio.


The game features an anime style familiar to fans of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, but an all-new setting and characters.


It&#x27;s more dramatic, however, with a seemingly sprawling map. Check out the trailer below.

In Still Wakes the Deep, players take on the role of an off-shore oil rig worker - stationed on the Beira D oil rig off the Scottish coast circa 1975 - who finds himself &quot;fighting for his life through a vicious storm, perilous surroundings, and the dark, freezing North Sea waters.&quot;


All communications with the outside world have been severed, all the exits are gone, and, worse, there&#x27;s something terrible onboard.

                              <span>One of the most promising micro-trends at this years&#x27; summer showcases is everyone discovering that climbing is rad, and climbing videogames are double rad because if you fall you don&#x27;t die. Anyway, continuing this theme, Life is Strange developer Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s new Jusant looks absolutely stellar.


It&#x27;s a sci-fi climbing game, by the looks of it, in which a young hero climbs endless mountain walls with a funny little creature for company. There looks to be puzzling, interaction with mountain communities, a range of surfaces to climb on, and a sprinkling of futuristic stuff. And at one point you ride a mushroom.


The sense of place - and the lighting, cor - is just wonderful. And the game&#x27;s due out in 2023. Cannot wait for this one.

                              <span>Fallout 76&#x27;s next expansion will take Bethesda&#x27;s game to Atlantic City, the spiritual home of Monopoly, according to a nifty animated trailer that dropped during Xbox&#x27;s summer showcase.


The video announced that after Appalachia had welcomed 15 million dwellers, Atlantic City beckons. New Jersey&#x27;s pleasure city was invoked with a lot of gambling imagery and a neat riff on one of Springsteen&#x27;s greatest songs, which I enjoyed at least.


Not much else to say at the moment, but the game is &quot;coming soon&quot;. If you get a chance, do dust off Nebraska, which is one of the Boss&#x27; finest.

                              <span>Xbox has confirmed that Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 will arrive in 2024. A new trailer was also shared as part of this evening&#x27;s Xbox Showcase. 


It is all rather chilling, with Xbox proclaiming that viewers will be able to &quot;Sink deep into the next chapter of Senua&#x27;s story&quot; thanks to the trailer&#x27;s &quot;cinematic immersion,  beautifully realised visuals and encapsulating sound from the team at Ninja Theory&quot;. 


It really is quite something, I have to say.  The footage for this trailer, which you can see below, was captured on Xbox Series X.

                              <span>A new Like a Dragon game has just been announced at Xbox Games Showcase. This time, starring Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga called Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening, neither is Ichiban, but the trailer and title of the game are exactly the kind of frivolous fun we&#x27;ve come to expect from the Like a Dragon series. The trailer shows a very naked Ichiban waking up on a beach somewhere in America. I don&#x27;t know either, pals.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is slated for an early 2024 release on Xbox and PC.

Now we can finally see gameplay of its vibrant world and first-person magical combat. Check it out below.

                              <span>Two years of furiously willing it into existence has paid off! Monkey Island is finally FINALLY coming to Sea of Thieves in a major story crossover starting on 20th July this year.


It&#x27;s not a complete surprise, of course; Rare first teased a Monkey Island crossover for Sea of Thieves back in 2021, tucked in a tiny corner of the game&#x27;s Pirates of the Caribbean adventure. And now self-proclaimed mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood and friends will be getting similar treatment across three brand-new Tall Tales.


Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island - as the crossover is officially known - begins on Mêlée Island, where Threepwood is inexplicably receiving adulation from his peers. What follows is a &quot;love-letter to the classic adventure game&quot; that&#x27;ll feature a host of familiar faces, including Murray, LeChuck, and more.

It&#x27;s like Asobo sat down and brainstormed every use for a plane that&#x27;s not just flying from A to B, and worked to put it in Microsoft Flight Sim. The list is frankly astonishing, and includes:


Aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulance, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, VIP charter service, air racing, glider pilot, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, executive transport service, airship tours and hot air balloon trips. Phew.

                              <span>At Xbox&#x27;s 2023 showcase today we just got out first glimpse of Thunder Lotus&#x27; new game. The developer behind Spiritfarer and Sundered has been working on 33 Immortals, a top-down action-RPG roguelite with a delicate hand-painted art style and co-op for 33 players. What?!


It looks like a fascinating piece of work, with a delicate, rather serious tone, sonorous choral music, and delicate animation. But also: 33 players in an action-RPG! Based on a bit of gameplay, 33 Immortals won&#x27;t scrimp when it comes to throwing loads of enemies your way, and there was a lovely bullet hell element to some of the spells going off.


33 Immortals will be released in 2024 for Xbox X/S, and will appear day one on Game Pass.

It is described as a &quot;fantastical&quot; and &quot;macabre third-person action-adventure&quot;, which is set in the American Deep South. Here is a little trailer for it.

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s Xbox Showcase gave us our first quick look at Star Wars Outlaws, from Ubisoft Massive, developer of The Division. It&#x27;s coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2024.


A CGI trailer showed a bounty hunter-stuffed trailer starring a smuggler character named Kay. What we saw offered just a glimpse, but it was very, very Star Wars.

                              <span>Richard Ayoade will star in Fable, as revealed in a new teaser trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase.


The UK comedian narrates the trailer as &#x27;Dave, vegetable enthusiast&#x27;, injecting a healthy dose of British humour the series is known for.


At least, until he&#x27;s actually an in-game giant.

                              <span>New research suggests that AIs can produce perfectly secure steganographic images:
Abstract: Steganography is the practice of encoding secret information into innocuous content in such a manner that an adversarial third party would not realize that there is hidden meaning. While this problem has classically been studied in security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure is perfectly secure under Cachin (1998)’s information theoretic-model of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency; additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines—arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping—using GPT-2, WaveRNN, and Image Transformer as communication channels. We find that the minimum entropy coupling-based approach achieves superior encoding efficiency, despite its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of minimum entropy coupling...</span>

This, remember, is a show broken into two halves and it all begins at 6pm UK time (BST) or 7pm CEST / 1pm EDT / 10am PDT. I&#x27;ll replace the image above with a live stream embed when they&#x27;re available. It&#x27;s showing on Twitch and YouTube, if you&#x27;re wondering.
I&#x27;ll be keeping tabs of everything that happens right here in a live report, while also chatting with you and pulling in your keen observations and witty remarks. We&#x27;ll play guess the game! It&#x27;s going to be so much fun you won&#x27;t even believe it.

                              <span>Talking to Eurogamer at Summer Games Fest today, Sonic Team vice president of product development Takashi Iizuka has clarified the question of the newly unveiled Sonic Superstars&#x27; main developer: it&#x27;s being led by Arzest, the Japanese studio which recently co-developed Fantasian and the troubled Balan Wonderworld - and that&#x27;s headed up by Sonic&#x27;s original creator Naoto Ohshima.
&quot;This is a brand new classic Sonic Game that&#x27;s been developed,&quot; Iizuka-san said, via translator, &quot;and in order to recreate that classic Sonic gameplay, we needed someone who understands the classic Sonic series and understands that gameplay format, in order to really execute well on the final product.&quot;
&quot;And so we&#x27;re working together, with Naoto Ohshima-san, who is the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog and was there at Sonic 1, creating and developing the game. We&#x27;re working with Ooshima-san and his team at Arzest, they&#x27;re leading development on the title and they&#x27;re doing a great job of making a brand new classic Sonic game.&quot;

Wallace and Gromit in the Grand Getaway was announced tonight via a quick teaser trailer at the Future Game Show. In it, we see a return of the duo&#x27;s spaceship from 1989 adventure A Grand Day Out, which Wallace has apparently piloted to an alien world. 


Where have Wallace and Gromit got to? Judging by the purple ringed planet in the sky and the sci-fi mountains nearby, this isn&#x27;t anywhere nearby. Let&#x27;s take a look:

                              <span>Mario voice actor Chris Pratt has discussed the inevitable sequel to the box office-breaking Super Mario Bros. Movie, and said that news on what comes next should be coming &quot;soon&quot;. 


Exactly how soon, however, seems to depend on the ongoing writer&#x27;s strike which has shutdown much of Hollywood.


&quot;We&#x27;re in the midst of this writers&#x27; strike, and so everything has been paused and on hold for the right reasons,&quot; Pratt told Entertainment Tonight.

                              <span>Yakuza fans are struggling to find out if there will be physical copies of upcoming spin-off Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name available to buy in the West.


The game&#x27;s official website confirms there will be a disc-based version in Asia - though only for PlayStation consoles, allowing PS4 copies to be played on PS5 consoles with disc drives. For the game&#x27;s PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S formats, &quot;no physical edition will be released&quot;. 


Outside of Asia, the situation is less clear. Local versions of the official website for the UK and USA omit any mention of a physical release, and simply point to digital storefronts for the game on all formats - PC, PlayStation and Xbox.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage sees Ubisoft&#x27;s historical stabathon series return to its roots with more grounded combat and abilities, a map focused entirely around one city, and a return to the Middle East - where the franchise began. 


Now, Ubisoft has revealed a further option that nods all the way back to Assassin&#x27;s Creed 1 (which, I&#x27;m slightly alarmed to acknowledge, is now nearing its 16th birthday).


Where Mirage&#x27;s colour palette is all golden sunrays and splashes of crimson, the original AC1 had a much bluer filter. To me, it pointed to the fact your historical adventures were all just a simulation - similar to the green palette employed in The Matrix films.

Starfield will (hopefully) launch on 6th September and we&#x27;ll get a much better look at it this Sunday 11th June, as part of Microsoft&#x27;s summer announcement show. It there&#x27;s we expect to see these leaked retail versions of the game  officially announced.


For now, reliable Dealabs leaker billbil-kun, has detailed that Starfield will launch with a standard version of the game (€70 on PC, €80 on Xbox Series X/S), a Premium Edition (around €105 on PC, €115 on Xbox Series X/S) and the hulking €300 Constellation Edition, which is the same price for either format.

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has said it will act to improve the game&#x27;s quality levels, after a recent snafu left players spending time and money hunting rare Shiny Pokémon with far lower-than-expected odds. 


The bug, which Niantic previously told Eurogamer was an &quot;unfortunate technical error&quot;, was eventually fixed by the developer only after fans worked to crowdsource data and diagnose the problem for themselves.


It was the latest in a string of issues which seem to regularly affect the hugely-successful mobile app, with the  release of Pokémon and the launch of in-game events frequently marred by some problem or other - particularly in early timezones such as New Zealand and Australia, where it is now a running joke in the game&#x27;s community that players act as unofficial beta testers.

Like its enormously enjoyable predecessor, Blasphemous 2 is part Metroidvania, part Souls-like, marrying a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling imagery.


Blasphemous 2 sees the return of pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One in an adventure set across a unfamiliar land - a labyrinthine new kingdom promising a &quot;series of enchantingly grotesque landscapes&quot;, and ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

Released all the way back in 2013, Payday 2 sees teams of up to four players turning to a life of crime, embarking on a career of increasingly outlandish heists across Washington DC.


Payday 2&#x27;s development officially ceased at the end of 2018, amid financial difficulties for Overkill&#x27;s parent company Starbreeze, but the game recieved a surprise resurrection the following year, and updates of various sizes have continued to release since then.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to last night&#x27;s Summer Game Fest opening livestream, which offered us a first look at new Sonic and Prince of Persia games, plus a mouth-watering glimpse at Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth.

What didn&#x27;t we see? A little oddly, Square Enix decided not to showcase Final Fantasy 16 - the one which actually goes on sale in a couple of weeks. Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty was also missing, as was host Geoff Keighley&#x27;s best pal Hideo Kojima. Once the conference concluded, discussion online focused on the lack of any women on stage, following appearances by a string of male developers - and also Nic Cage.
On the upside, no one unexpectedly walked on stage and got arrested. So, how do we feel about all that, and how would we rate the conference overall? Was it a satisfying alternative to E3? Or are we hoping for more now from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom over the coming days? Joining me to discuss all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>At the Devolver Direct showcase, the publisher announced brand new game Baby Steps, from the developer behind Ape Out and Getting Over It.


It is, quite literally, a walking simulator and features adult man-baby Nate (not of the Drake variety) learning how to walk.


Nate, you see, is unemployed and lives with his parents, spending his time nestled in front of the television until he&#x27;s sucked into a fantasy world inside the screen.

According to well-informed film critic Jeff Sneider, Universal and Illumination are close to closing a &quot;big deal&quot; with Nintendo to adapt the Legend of Zelda. 


Stating he doesn&#x27;t believe this news to be a huge surprise, Sneider told The Hot Mic Podcast &quot;Zelda is looking like the next big Illumination x Nintendo franchise&quot;.

The skin is no longer available to buy in both Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone.


Nickmercs&#x27; comment was in response to a video shared by esports caster Chris Puckett in which pro-LGBT+ demonstrators were attacked outside of a school in California. &quot;Americans are in a sad place right now,&quot; said Puckett. &quot;Let people love who they love and live your own life.&quot;

As for the Lara Croft bean skin, it is taking inspiration from the classic Lara of old, complete with short shorts, tank top, dinky backpack and braided hair.

But those that stuck around post-Keighley were, as is fast becoming tradition, rewarded with another batch of intriguing indie titles, courtesy of this year&#x27;s Day of the Devs stream - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below.

Beastieball

Beastieball is a new RPG from Wishes Unlimited, the studio behind the acclaimed Wondersong and Chicory. This time around, the team is turning its attention to what looks something like Pokémon with its combat replaced by a strategic, turn-based take on volleyball. It sees players, in the role of a coach, touring the world and signing up Beasties they encounter to join their team and take on rivals in bouts of Beastieball. Loads of Beasties are promised, and they can all form friendships that&#x27;ll create unique combos for use in matches. This one might still be a little way off, though - a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign launches soon.

                              <span>PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 cult action adventure Shadows of the Damned is getting a remaster, developer Grasshopper Manufacture has announced. 


More details on the project - and further reveals - will come next week in a dedicated Grasshopper Direct livestream. Yes, another one. 


If you missed Shadows of the Damned at the time, it&#x27;s a slightly silly demon shooter written by Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda, back from around the same time as Lollipop Chainsaw (a remaster of which was previously confirmed for launch this year).

                              <span>Amid the hubbub of the Summer Geoffs, Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have given a fresh look at Warhammer: Space Marine 2, showing of a slice of co-op campaign gameplay ahead of its arrival this &quot;winter&quot;.


Announced during last year&#x27;s The Game Awards, Space Marine 2 expands on the third-person shoot-and-slash template of the Relic Entertainment developed original, which released all the way back in 2011. It sees the return of the first game&#x27;s protagonist, Captain Titus (albeit with a new voice actor), and a new threat in the form of the Tyranids.


One of Space Marine 2&#x27;s big new features, not previously revealed, is the ability to play its main campaign either solo or in three-player co-op mode either with two friends of AI. And we&#x27;ve not been given a glimpse of that courtesy of its newly revealed Summer Game Fest trailer.

                              <span>Hello! The Summer Game Fest 2023 opening livestream has ended. The two hour show brought us a variety of new trailers for upcoming games, along with annoucements for ones which have already been released.
Don&#x27;t worry if you missed it, below you&#x27;ll find everything announced during the Summer Game Fest 2023 opening event, as it happened. (Be prepared - there&#x27;s quite a lot.)
It all began with a reveal for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown from Ubisoft, which will be released on 18th January 2024:

                              <span>Horror movie legend John Carpenter is teaming up with Saber Interactive for Toxic Commando, a co-op FPS promising &#x27;80&#x27;s vibes, action, humour, and horror&#x27; when it launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime next year.


Toxic Commando&#x27;s action unfolds somewhere in the &quot;near future&quot;, in a world where a failed experiment to harness the power of the Earth&#x27;s core has unleashed an Eldritch abomination known as the Sludge God, intent on &quot;turning soil to scum and the living to undead monsters&quot;.


Enter the Toxic Commandos, or, more specifically, up to four players, who&#x27;ll each need to select a class to suit their playstyle. From there, it&#x27;s a case of grabbing a weapon (firearms, grenades, even a katana), then tackling the mutant hordes on-foot or from behind the wheel of a vehicle.

                              <span>As one online game announcement livestream ends, so another is confirmed. Tonight, during Summer Games Fest 2023, indie megapublisher Annapurna Interactive revealed it had its own dedicated show on the way. 


Set to be broadcast on 29th June at 8pm UK time (3pm Eastern, 12pm Pacific) this showcase will reveal what&#x27;s next for the publisher of top indie games such as Outer Wilds and What Remains of Edith Finch.


Indeed, a sneaky teaser pointed to some of what we might expect, which you can watch below. The teaser concludes with a promise of &quot;one of our biggest announcements yet&quot;.

The game is so big, it will be on two discs and is a PlayStation 5 exclusive.


Square Enix has been teasing a reveal all week with developer comments of varying detail - today was day seven, resulting in the trailer below.

                              <span>As part of Summer Game Fest, we were given a fresh look at the upcoming Twisted Metal TV series. 


Will Arnett, who is voicing Sweet Tooth in this adaptation, introduced the new trailer, which sees Anthony Mackie squaring off with the series&#x27; clown-faced killer in an arcade. Actually, maybe those are slot machines. 


It&#x27;s all pretty awkward, if I am honest. Sweet Tooth pushes Mackie&#x27;s John Doe up against a cabinet and makes him sing along with him as the two share back and forth quips. But, it is what it is, as you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>Summer Games Fest 2023 just dropped the cinematic trailer for Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3: Wilds, which kicks off tomorrow.


The trailer is typically charming. The centre of the island has collapsed revealing a jungle. A bunch of heroes investigate an ancient temple, Fishstick does the Lara Croft emote roll, there are vines that are also grind rails and rideable velociraptor mounts. It&#x27;s basically everything you could want.


Then Optimus Prime turns up, things go wrong, and at the very end the big reveal is... Slone is back! SLONE IS BACK!

                              <span>Second Dinner&#x27;s chief development officer Ben Brode&#x27;s just taken the stage at Summer Game Fest to announce that Marvel Snap&#x27;s getting its &quot;biggest update ever&quot; next week, and it will contain a new mode.


Brode described Conquest mode as &quot;a great way to get a super competitive experience&quot;. The mode was announced recently, and seems to hinge on competing against the same opponent multiple times, draining their health with each win. It won&#x27;t replace the standard game mode, but will provide another option.


Marvel Snap&#x27;s a brilliant collectible card game for smartphones and PC. It&#x27;s got some genuinely brilliant cards in it and loads of fascinating design ideas. Do check it out.

Ahead of the reveal, Remedy&#x27;s Sam Lake shared some extra detail, including the game will feature two playable characters that players can swap between. The game is split evenly between both, with each narrative taking place in different worlds.


Lake also reiterated this is Remedy&#x27;s first survival horror. The gameplay footage features new character Saga, who appears to be living a narrative that Wake has written.

Ever Crisis is the remake of the original game for mobile platforms that was announced a few years back but is still yet to be released. Fans can sign up for a closed beta test on Android from 8th June - 29th June.


This isn&#x27;t just a remake, though. Not only does it feature new character models and flashy battles, it reimagines the whole Final Fantasy 7 saga - including Crisis Core - with extra narrative.

                              <span>Summer Games Fest is underway and Bandai Namco has just revealed a new third-person action game from Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball. It&#x27;s called Sand Land, and its based on Toriyama&#x27;s manga from 2000.


Sand Land&#x27;s set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply. When lawlessness breaks out over rising water costs, a sheriff approaches some local demons to strike a bargain.


What this means from the game&#x27;s reveal is an action game set in what looks like a large open world. Players explore in everything from hoverbikes to tanks and even on the backs of dinosaurs. There&#x27;s elaborate futuristic weaponry and fast third-person combat. It&#x27;s enlivened by lovely comic visual design and an art style that recalls things like Borderlands, with visible pen lines on characters and the landscape.

                              <span>If it&#x27;s weird crossovers you want, how about Street Fighter obots smashing against killer dinos? Because that&#x27;s what Capcom&#x27;s offering in its newly announced Exoprimal collaboration.


Exoprimal is, of course, Capcom&#x27;s new squad-based multiplayer shooter, in which teams of five, adorned in ridiculously over-the-top mech-style armour known as Exosuits, take on hordes of dinosaurs, from swarming raptors to marauding T. rexes.


And that&#x27;s where Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 collaboration comes in, with a bunch of familiar faces from the long-running franchise dropping into Exoprimal in the form of stylised Exosuits.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest has kicked off. Literally. 


Along with the newly announced Prince of Persia game, we were swiftly treated to a look at Mortal Kombat 1. This included gameplay, so expect plenty of blood and gore. I am talking about decapitations, saws to the face, spinal cord removal. You know, kind of what you&#x27;d expect from the famously brutal fighter series. 


Here is that trailer. Maybe put any food you were eating to one side before diving in.

                              <span>Gun Interactive has announced an end for Friday the 13th: The Game, confirming the asymmetrical multiplayer horror will be pulled from stores on 31st December this year, the same day its Friday the 13th licence officially expires.


Friday the 13th: The Game has been around since 2017, and, despite a rocky start, proved to be a solidly entertaining - and commercially successful - horror experience. Unfortunately, its development was forced to end prematurely in 2018 amid a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the Friday the 13th licence, and 2020 bought the news Gun would be decommissioning the game&#x27;s dedicated servers, reverting to the peer-to-peer networking favoured at launch.


Since then, with no new content in development, Friday the 13th: The Game has largely remained out of the spotlight, but, now, Gun has confirmed - in a statement shared on Twitter - the game&#x27;ll no longer be available to purchase, either digitally or physically, once its licence expires on 31st December 2023. There&#x27;s some small solace for owners, however, in that the developer says the game will remain playable through &quot;at least&quot; 31st December 2024.

Mobile device backups contain a partial copy of the filesystem, including some of the user data and service databases. The timestamps of the files, folders and the database records allow to roughly reconstruct the events happening to the device. The mvt-ios utility produces a sorted timeline of events into a file called “timeline.csv,” similar to a super-timeline used by conventional digital forensic tools.
Using this timeline, we were able to identify specific artifacts that indicate the compromise. This allowed to move the research forward, and to reconstruct the general infection sequence:...</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s the most wonderful time of the year. No, not the silly festive season but June, when all the big games companies come out to play and show us what they&#x27;ve got. And the centrepoint of it all will be today&#x27;s Opening Showcase of Summer Game Fest.
It begins at 8pm UK time (9pm CEST / 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT) and you can watch the stream here while we report live on what we see. I&#x27;m sure you know the drill by now, but this is a chance for us to follow the announcements together and talk about whether we&#x27;re impressed by them. Will we be?
What is on the cards for tonight, then - what should we expect? Well, Geoff Keighley, obviously, because it&#x27;s his show. But in terms of head-turning games: Ed Boon will be there to show Mortal Kombat 1, the franchise reboot, and Remedy&#x27;s Sam Lake will be there to show more of Alan Wake 2.

                              <span>Yesterday, legendary actress Whoopi Goldberg took to Instagram to blast Blizzard for not releasing Diablo 4 for Apple.

In a minute-long video, Goldberg explained how excited she was to play Diablo 4, which she called her &quot;favourite game&quot; series, on her Apple computer, which she called her &quot;favourite gaming system&quot;. 

&quot;I know there&#x27;s a lot of terrible things happening in the world, but what I&#x27;m about to tell you is not on any scale like that,&quot; Goldberg said. Indeed, it&#x27;s not quite as grim as seeing Diablo 4&#x27;s billboard advert against the backdrop of wildfires, or Activision Blizzard CCO Lulu Cheng Meservey assuring us the company has &quot;no affiliation or partnership&quot; with said natural disaster. But you know what they say - an Apple a day keeps the demons away. Or something like that.

                              <span>A lengthy list of details for upcoming Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name has leaked, presumably ahead of a formal announcement at one of this year&#x27;s not-E3 livestreams, or developer RGG Studio&#x27;s own showcase next week. 

Gaiden was first announced in September last year, when it was described as a more compact return to the action gameplay of previous games in the series. Plot-wise, the game will follow series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and explain what happened to him in the gap between Yakuza 6 and Like a Dragon 8.

Back in September, Gaiden was teased with a release date at some point this year. Now, it seems the game will launch in November, according to data scraped by website PS Deals (thanks, Gematsu).

That&#x27;s according to cryptic teases laid out by Ubisoft itself which have now been cracked by the series&#x27; enterprising community. 


Data strings written in binary programming language found on a promotional image for Nexus appear to correspond to the birth dates of three Assassin&#x27;s Creed characters.

Amongst the additions for Season 4 are new maps, new operators, and limited time launch modes.
Vondel, the recently-leaked new map, looks to be inspired by Amsterdam and its canal system. Players will be able to dive into the canals or drive across them to move around Vondel. In size, Vondel is somewhere between Al Mazrah and Ashika Island.

                              <span>PlayStation and Kojima Productions have released a new trailer for their Hideo Kojima documentary, which is said to promise a &quot;creative journey into the mind of a video games icon&quot;.  


Known as Connecting Worlds, this documentary will provide us with a &quot;rare insight&quot; into Kojima&#x27;s creative process, with the likes of Norman Reedus - currently working with Kojima on Death Stranding&#x27;s sequel DS2 - and filmmaker Guillermo del Toro contributing to the upcoming production.


In a short trailer, which you can see below, Reedus likens working with Kojima to &quot;stepping into Willy Wonka&#x27;s Chocolate Factory with Willy Wonka&quot;.  Meanwhile, on screen text proclaims Kojima as being &quot;widely regarded as the first auteur of video games&quot;. From what I can tell, this documentary will cover Kojima&#x27;s experience founding Kojima Productions as well as his creative process.

Appropriately titled Season&#x27;s Greetings, this DLC will act as a prequel taking place nine months before the main story of Lake. This time, players will take on the role of Thomas Weiss, father of Lake&#x27;s protagonist Meredith Weiss, as he goes about his days delivering mail to the residents of Providence Oaks, while readying himself for a visit from his daughter. 


Lake developer Gamious promises more of the same cosy and relaxing gameplay in Season&#x27;s Greetings, with the addition of new characters as well as some familiar faces. There will also be the chance to find answers to some of those lingering questions players still have from the main game - though the developer stopped short of spoiling any specifics. You can see a short trailer for Season&#x27;s Greetings below.

                              <span>World of Horror, the Junji-Ito-inspired roguelike RPG from developer Paweł Koźmiński, leaves PC early access on 19th October and releases for PlayStation and Switch on the same day.


World of Horror initially launched into PC early access a little over three years ago, and its deliciously nasty tale of a seaside town beseiged by malevolent cosmic forces - which players must investigate over the course of five randomly selected mysteries each playthrough - has slowly expanded with new stories, events, and features since then.


If you&#x27;ve not yet hopped onboard World of Horror&#x27;s early access, the whole thing plays out something like a 1-bit version of the board game Arkham Horror, albeit with Lovecraftian overtones traded for something closer to Junji Ito&#x27;s distinct brand of the mundane run amok - so think high school terror, haunted bulletin board systems, and so on.

As its name suggests, Dr. Fetus&#x27; Mean Meat Machine turns the spotlight on Super meat Boy villain Dr. Fetus who, this time around, is aiming to create the perfect clone of Meat Boy - a process requiring him to eliminate all the rubbish clones first.


And so enter the Mean Meat Machine, a terrifying contraption that sees malformed clones dropping in at the top and then falling en masse to the bottom, wending their way past an array of deadly devices as they go, including chainsaws, missiles, and lasers.

                              <span>ThroughLine Games, the studio behind the acclaimed Forgotton Anne, has unveiled Forgotlings, an equally gorgeous &quot;spiritual sequel&quot; that&#x27;s just launched a Kickstarter campaign.


Forgotlings, like its predecessor, takes place in a &quot;magical realm inhabited by things we have lost and forgotten&quot;, where sentient creatures - the Forgotlings - live in search of a purpose.


However, despite its shared universe, Forgotlings looks to be something of a new beginning in both story and gameplay terms. It casts players as Fig, a &quot;gifted posing doll&quot;, thrust into a world caught in a conflict between five mighty tribes. Fig will need to unite each tribe to save the world from destruction at the hands of an &quot;enigmatic Beast&quot;.

American approval, even if indirect, has been at the heart of Paragon’s strategy. The company sought a list of allied nations that the US wouldn’t object to seeing deploy Graphite.

Dimension Shellshock promises to bring fans an &quot;all-new adventure&quot; introducing the Ninja Turtles&#x27; occasional ally Miyamoto Usagi, who originally made the jump from his own Usagi Yojimbo comicbook series into the turtles&#x27; world back in 1987.


Alongside its new playable character (the announcement trailer teases new playable &quot;characters&quot; but doesn&#x27;t elaborate further), Dimension Shellshock also includes a mysterious new game mode, alternative colour palette options, plus new music composed by Tee Lopes.

                              <span>The first major Counter-Strike 2 update has arrived since the game launched as a limited test in March, bringing with it a radical new loadout system, new buy mechanics and - finally! - a new map for testing purposes, Mirage. 
The loadout system has the potential to be the most disruptive change, as you can now choose five each of pistols, rifles and &quot;mid-tier&quot; (SMG/shotgun) weapons to take into a match. Previously, weapons like the silenced and unsilenced M4 were assigned to the same category, so you would have to go without one of them - but here, you could sacrifice one of the less-used rifles to have both options available. This change has been requested by players for a long time, and would also make it easier for developers Valve to add new weapons in the future, so it&#x27;s a big win in my book. 
When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first appeared more than a decade ago, it sported a radial buy menu designed to mesh nicely to gamepad controls - after all, the game was originally intended to buy a console-focused iteration of the franchise. That menu has been replaced in the new Counter-Strike 2 update, in favour of a simpler grid-based buy menu that shows your teammate&#x27;s purchases. Crucially, it&#x27;s now possible to refund unused weapons, armour and grenades before buy time expires at the start of each round, saving you from the ignoble fate of spending all your hard-earned cash on a weapon you bought accidentally - always a pain given the importance of Counter-Strike&#x27;s round-to-round economy system.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive is offering refunds to those who have pre-ordered Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, following multiple delays.


In an blog update today, the publisher acknowledged it had been a while since many pre-orders had been placed. Three years later, Bloodlines 2 still does not have a release date.


Paradox said it was still &quot;dedicated to delivering&quot; a great game, but that it was now updating its various editions and bonus content. &quot;With the bonus content being updated, the prior physical edition offered items that are no longer representative of the game,&quot; it explained. As such, the publisher said it was offering refunds in order to &quot;provide the best value&quot;.

Yet here we are. Winnie&#x27;s Hole, as it&#x27;s known, is an actual real video game you can wishlist on Steam.

                              <span>Two years after the launch of Monster Hunter Rise and a little under a year since the arrival of its mighty Sunbreak expansion, Capcom is ready to release its last-ever content update for Sunbreak players, bringing one final monster to Switch and Steam tomorrow, 8th June.


While elder dragon Amatsu was originally supposed to bring Sunbreak&#x27;s story to a close in April&#x27;s Ver. 15 update, Capcom says it decided to squeeze one last surprise in for players after it identified a few additional features it wanted to include.


As such, Sunbreak owners will face a final, formidable challenge when tomorrow&#x27;s free Title Update 6 (AKA Ver. 16) arrives, bringing the expansion&#x27;s story to a close with a battle against the Primordial Malzeno, revealing more on its relationship with the Kingdom. The fight - which features new moves compared to the original version of Malzeno - will be available to hunters at Master Rank 10 and above, and includes materials needed to craft new weapons and armour.

                              <span>Fntastic, the developer behind upcoming zombie MMO The Day Before, has addressed the rather unusual trademark dispute that led to the game being delayed.


As a quick reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release on PC back in March. However, in a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game&#x27;s name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam.


Talking to WellPlayed, Fntastic has now provided a small update on this trademark debacle, stating it believes &quot;power is in the truth&quot;.

Expeditions, for those unfamiliar with No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s ways, are something like Hello Games&#x27; stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim&#x27;s various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges with some nifty rewards.


Its latest expedition, Singularity, which launches today, continues the story started in April&#x27;s Interceptor update (the one with weird, corrupted worlds and strange Sentinel oddities), asking players to investigate curious robot heads delivering cryptic clues across the galaxy. Its events are said to be part of a longer narrative that&#x27;ll play out as the year goes on.

The release date for Starbreeze&#x27;s heist shooter sequel was spotted by Aggiornamenti Lumia, a Twitter account which regularly surfaces listings on the Microsoft Store before they are publicly visible. 


It&#x27;s interesting timing for a Payday 3 launch date to appear - just a day before Summer Games Fest 2023 kicks off in earnest with an announcement-filled livestream. Other events from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom are also set to follow in the coming days.

This may seem obvious - after all, our own planet is of course a sphere (sorry Flat Earthers) - but when so many games present a flat map, it&#x27;s easy to misinterpret.


Harrison Pink, senior quest designer on the game, shared this &quot;tiny lore nugget&quot; on Twitter.

                              <span>Twitch has apologised for updates made to its branded content policy which have upset streamers across the platform.


Yesterday, the company updated its Branded Content Guidelines that detail what is and isn&#x27;t allowed on the platform in terms of branded and sponsored streams, a major way streamers generate extra revenue.


The new rules were met with anger by large swathes of the streaming community, forcing Twitch to apologise and rewrite its guidelines.

                              <span>Amazon and Rovio have announced a new animated TV series based on the popular mobile game Angry Birds. 


Angry Birds: Mystery Island will follow the escapades of three new hatchlings - Mia, Rosie, and Buddy. There is also a new foreign-exchange piglet, and his name is the rather brilliant Hamylton. 


According to a press release, these four &quot;rambunctious tweens&quot; receive an all expenses paid island getaway, but of course things are not going to go to plan. Rather than landing where they intended, they instead get unceremoniously catapulted onto an &quot;uncharted island&quot; (where I assume they will meet Nathan Drake).

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has apologised for a &quot;technical issue&quot; discovered by players this week which affected the odds of encountering the game&#x27;s much-coveted Shiny Pokémon when battling bosses using a Remote Raid Pass. 

Niantic will now return any Remote Raid Pass used on these bosses, and hold an additional &quot;special event&quot; to make up for the error.
Remote Raid Passes were recently nerfed by Niantic to make them less attractive for players to use, with a limit on the number of times they can be used per day and a more expensive price tag. The discovery that Remote Raid Passes were giving lower-than-expected Shiny odds left fans wondering whether this was yet another change by Niantic.

                              <span>EA has confirmed reports it&#x27;s in talks to move the development of BioWare&#x27;s long-running free-to-play MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic to a third-party so the studio can focus on its upcoming new Mass Effect and Dragon Age instalments.


News of EA&#x27;s plans were first reported by IGN, who claimed the publisher was currently considering shifting The Old Republic&#x27;s development to Broadsword Online Games, a company run by former BioWare vice president and Mythic Entertainment co-founder Rob Denton, who previously worked on the Star Wars title in its early days.


Broadsword is no stranger to MMOs, of course - its other projects include ongoing work on Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot - and IGN reported EA had already signed a letter of intent with the studio, which would see The Old Republic deal finalised &quot;as soon as this month&quot;.

The big news this time around is that the Forgotten Lands&#x27; mysterious pumpkin house, which has sat vacant amid gloomy woods since launch, will finally have an occupant as part of what Gameloft is calling Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s &quot;biggest story update yet&quot;.


To the surprise of no-one with at least a passing interest in Disney, its new occupant will be Cinderella&#x27;s Fairy Godmother - who comes complete with her own set of Friendship Quests - with her arrival seemingly signalling a conclusion for Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s first major story arc.

Planet Zoo&#x27;s Arid Animal Pack marks the game&#x27;s 15th DLC expansion since its launch at the end of 2019, and - as with all Animal Packs - is predominantly focused on expanding the game&#x27;s wildlife roster, this time with eight new creature additions.


Purchasers get access to the single-humped dromedary camel, the African crested porcupine, the black rhino, the addax (today I learned what an addax is!), the Somali wild ass, the sand cat, the dama gazelle, and the desert horned viper, which appears as an exhibit animal.

Career Rank is described as a &quot;larger progression system&quot; that reflects players&#x27; time across the entirety of Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer modes, and is said to be similar to the progression systems found in Halo: Reach and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.


According to 343, Career Rank is tied to a player&#x27;s Personal Score, meaning that while all multiplayer matches will help players rank up, better match performance means faster progress through its various tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Onyx.

                              <span>I originally had a throwaway joke on Twitter that became an article: 17 Ways to Run Containers on AWS. That was all well and good, and because I don&#x27;t know when to leave well enough alone, a few months later I wrote 17 More Ways to Run Containers on AWS. And now, since I don&#x27;t know when to leave well enough alone and stop beating the greasy smear on the sidewalk where the horse used to be, I want to introduce the third article in this series.
The post 17 Final Ways to Run Containers appeared first on Last Week in AWS.</span>

                              <span>New paper: “Lessons Lost: Incident Response in the Age of Cyber Insurance and Breach Attorneys“:
Abstract: Incident Response (IR) allows victim firms to detect, contain, and recover from security incidents. It should also help the wider community avoid similar attacks in the future. In pursuit of these goals, technical practitioners are increasingly influenced by stakeholders like cyber insurers and lawyers. This paper explores these impacts via a multi-stage, mixed methods research design that involved 69 expert interviews, data on commercial relationships, and an online validation workshop. The first stage of our study established 11 stylized facts that describe how cyber insurance sends work to a small numbers of IR firms, drives down the fee paid, and appoints lawyers to direct technical investigators. The second stage showed that lawyers when directing incident response often: introduce legalistic contractual and communication steps that slow-down incident response; advise IR practitioners not to write down remediation steps or to produce formal reports; and restrict access to any documents produced...</span>

                              <span>Blizzard seems pretty chuffed with the response to Diablo 4, and is now trumpeting the fact that, not only have players cumulatively already racked up over 10,000 years of play time, Diablo 4 is also the company&#x27;s &quot;fastest-selling game of all time&quot;.


Blizzard is calculating those impressive-sounding play time figures based on the number of in-game hours players have accrued since 1st June, the date when Diablo 4 entered &quot;early access&quot; for those willing to pay extra for the privilege.


The company reckons over 93m hours of Diablo 4 have been played across the first four days, equating to over 10,000 years (actually more like 10,616 hours according to my calculator, but who am I to quibble maths?) - or, as Blizzard puts it, the equivalent of one person &quot;playing 24 hours a day since the beginning of human civilisation&quot;.

The upcoming animated film was announced in February. It&#x27;s a big deal for fans, as it&#x27;ll mark the first time favourite characters such as Leon Kennedy and Jill Valentine are on-screen together. 


The pair, as well as returning protagonists Rebecca Chambers, Chris and Claire Redfield, are brought together when investigating a number of bioweapon-related cases.

The fine is in response to the collection of personal information from children via Xbox without parents being notified or giving consent, as well as the illegal retention of that information, the FTC has said.



As a result, Microsoft is required to make a number of changes to improve privacy protection for children on Xbox.

Fergusson was interviewed by Kinda Funny Games and discussed the live-service format for the game and how it allows for substantial updates.


&quot;As I sit here we&#x27;re about to launch the main game, we&#x27;re finishing up season one, we&#x27;re working on season two, we&#x27;re working on expansion one, we&#x27;re kicking off expansion two,&quot; said Fergusson. &quot;All that&#x27;s happening right now and we haven&#x27;t even launched the game yet.&quot;

The livestream will run for &quot;roughly 36 minutes&quot;, Capcom has said, and features &quot;news and updates on our latest games&quot;. 


No specific titles are mentioned, but it seems likely we&#x27;ll see more of dinosaur shooting game Exoprimal (which is out next month) and perhaps a bit of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 (which we got a glimpse of last month at Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase).

Kojima broke the news during Apple&#x27;s WWDC 2023 keynote presentation, beaming onto Apple&#x27;s expansive digital set to express his enthusiasm for the company&#x27;s products. &quot;I have been a die-hard Apple fan since I bought my first Mac back in 1994,&quot; Kojima explained. &quot;It has been a dream of mine to see my team&#x27;s best work come to life on the Mac.&quot;


To that end, Kojima said his studio&#x27;s support for Mac would begin &quot;later this year&quot;, with the launch of its expanded package-delivery-in-a-damp-valley extravaganza, Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut. &quot;This is just the beginning,&quot; Kojima added, &quot;and we are actively working to bring our future titles to Apple platforms&quot;.

                              <span>With just days to go until the launch of Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 4 Season 3 on 9th June, Epic is steadily ramping up its teases for some of the things the new season will bring, including the apparent confirmation of a previously rumoured new jungle biome.


Word that Epic might be preparing to bring a jungle biome to the latest iteration of Fortnite&#x27;s map first came via leakers back in April. And a couple of recent official social media asset updates - including some art of a city bordered by vines - lent further credence to those reports.


But now, thanks to a new 8-second teaser shared on the official Fortnite Twitter feed, a jungle biome is a good as confirmed. Peer closely betwixt the lettering and a brisk flyover awaits, skiming over raging waters and lush, mist-shrouded tropical foliage before the camera comes to a halt in view of some squat stone ruins perched atop a cliffside.

                              <span>After years of rumour and speculation, Apple has unveiled its long-in-the-works augmented reality headset, Vision Pro, which is due to release &quot;early next year&quot; for $3,499 USD.


Vision Pro - which Apple is insisting on referring to as a &quot;spatial computer&quot; - is designed around the idea of staying &quot;present and connected to others&quot;, whether at home or at work. Which, in more practical terms, means its entire 3D interface is built around experiencing apps and other media directly within a user&#x27;s immediate environment, as viewed through its internal display.


Apps can been relocated and resized in the physical space using Apple&#x27;s new VisionOS 3D interface, which is primarily controlled through a mix of voice commands, eye tracking, and hand tracking - although traditional keyboards and trackpads are compatible.

                              <span>Extensive gameplay of Ubisoft&#x27;s open-world racer The Crew Motorfest has appeared online just a week ahead of its planned appearance at the publisher&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase.


Ubisoft unveiled The Crew Motorfest for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC back in January with a 49-second trailer featuring a handful of &quot;in-engine&quot; cinematics. It&#x27;s a live-service game themed around a &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; motoring festival, promising &quot;tailor-made races, themed events, and other unique challenges&quot;, all taking place on the scenic Hawaiian island of O&#x27;ahu.


Since that official announcement, Ubisoft has hosted several &quot;insider programme&quot; closed testing sessions for registered players, with the fourth phase currently underway. It&#x27;s this latest closed test that appears to have generated the spate of new gameplay videos Ubisoft is currently playing copyright-strike whack-a-mole with online.

I wrote the essay below in September 2013. The New Yorker agreed to publish it, but the Guardian asked me not to. It was scared of UK law enforcement, and worried that this essay would reflect badly on it. And given that the UK police would raid its offices in July 2014, it had legitimate cause to be worried.
Now, ten years later, I offer this as a time capsule of what those early months of Snowden were like...</span>

                              <span>Capcom has been hitting it out of the park recently with its Resident Evil remakes, but what would it look like if the publisher decided to take its games in the opposite direction?

Well, you don&#x27;t have to wonder any longer, thanks to a group of modders creating a Resident Evil 0 demake. The game was originally released in 2002 for the GameCube, and looks and plays similar to the HD Resident Evil remaster.

This demake for 0 does the opposite, however, and turns the game into a Resident Evil experience like that of the first three games on PlayStation 1. Footage of the project in action can be seen below, via El Rincon del Lobezno&#x27;s YouTube channel, who is one of the modders involved in its creation.

Beginning at the end of last week, Square Enix has issued fresh comments on the game each day - thankfully remembering the project still exists, after nearly a year of no news.



The first comment confirmed a release date was being considered, while subsequent comments have noted that the game will have a &quot;multifaceted world with a high degree of freedom&quot; - which some fans are interpreting to mean &quot;open world&quot;. Lastly, Square Enix has  clarified that yes, this game will in fact contain a story and characters. Who&#x27;d have thought?

It also remains regularly updated - and today, we heard word that Dead Cells would continue getting further updates for at least another two years, until 2025. Gosh, that sounds like the future!

Ahead of the game&#x27;s early release on Friday, Blizzard announced a &quot;race event&quot; where the first 1000 players to reach level 100 on hardcore difficulty will be &quot;immortalised on a statue of Lilith&quot;. Now we know the first.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a sequel to 2017&#x27;s Breath of the Wild, and even before the game was released we knew some time had passed between the two. 


How much time? That remains something of a mystery - and something Nintendo itself has shied away from providing any official timeline for.


However, I - and other fans - think we may have sussed it. Please note, there are some minor Tears of the Kingdom spoilers below.

                              <span>Developer S-Game has stated that its upcoming game Phantom Blade Zero will have no gacha mechanics or microtransactions, and will focus on being &quot;approachable&quot; whilst incorporating some Souls-like elements.

Phantom Blade Zero was officially announced a couple of weeks ago at Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase, where it gained attention for its slick wuxia-influenced combat and Souls-esque vibes.

The plot follows Soul, an elite assassin for an organisation known as The Order, as he attempts to track the person who framed him for killing the The Order&#x27;s patriarch on limited time. S-Game made the comments on what players can expect in its Discord server through a series of developer Q&amp;As.

When fans on Resetera noted the footage wasn&#x27;t in the recent PlayStation Showcase trailer, Stevenson replied: &quot;It is new&quot;.

The newest of these discoveries are two unused paraglider fabrics, found by dataminers.

Fabrics can be taken to the dye shop in Hateno Village, where you can customise your glider with different designs. While some fabrics can be gained by completing side quests, others are (annoyingly) locked behind scanning Amiibo.

Sony will study &quot;various options&quot; around streaming games, even using its AI agent GT Sophy to enhance cloud gaming, said Yoshida in an interview with the Financial Times.


&quot;I think cloud itself is an amazing business model, but when it comes to games, the technical difficulties are high,&quot; said Yoshida. &quot;So there will be challenges to cloud gaming, but we want to take on those challenges.&quot;

Responding to Xbox fans via Twitter, Greenberg said that &quot;none of our first-party games in the show are full CG trailers&quot;. There will also be &quot;no movie or TV show trailers in our games show,&quot; he added.


Sony was criticised by some fans for using CG footage in its recent PlayStation Showcase. That event also included a trailer for Sony&#x27;s upcoming Gran Turismo movie.

                              <span>Developers are starting to talk about the software-defined car.
For decades, features have accumulated like cruft in new vehicles: a box here to control the antilock brakes, a module there to run the cruise control radar, and so on. Now engineers and designers are rationalizing the way they go about building new models, taking advantage of much more powerful hardware to consolidate all those discrete functions into a small number of domain controllers.
The behavior of new cars is increasingly defined by software, too. This is merely the progression of a trend that began at the end of the 1970s with the introduction of the first electronic engine control units; today, code controls a car’s engine and transmission (or its electric motors and battery pack), the steering, brakes, suspension, interior and exterior lighting, and more, depending on how new (and how expensive) it is. And those systems are being leveraged for convenience or safety features like adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, remote parking, and so on...</span>

Ascension was one of the more mysterious projects announced alongside the news that Bloober Team was remaking Silent Hill 2, and there&#x27;s not been much else said about it since, despite the release date originally pointing to early 2023.

Now, however, we&#x27;ve got an &quot;official trailer&quot; – which is more than we had last time – and confirmation that it&#x27;s still on track to release at some point later this year.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly considering withdrawing Activision from the UK in a bid to bypass the country&#x27;s merger block.

According to a new Bloomberg (£) and spotted by VGC, Microsoft president Brad Smith plans to meet UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to discuss firsthand the company&#x27;s frustration at the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) decision to block the $69bn acquisition.

Though in the UK for a talk about regulating AI, Smith also hopes to hold private discussions with the Chancellor, including, according to a spokesperson, &quot;the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard as we remain committed to finding creative and constructive ways to address remaining regulatory concerns&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft has allegedly stepped in and deleted an Xbox achievement after players complained that it was unobtainable.

Casual farming sim Homestead Arcana came to Xbox Game Pass in April, complete with the usual 30+ achievements that reward working your way through the game&#x27;s story and various activities.

However, it didn&#x27;t take long for players to realise that one of the achievements – called &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Too Prepared&quot; – was proving difficult to complete, as it requires players to craft every item in the game at least once.

In a new survey circulated to Resident Evil fans, Capcom first polls your thoughts on its social media channels and gauges how much you use and appreciate its community efforts. 

But right at the end, once you&#x27;ve fed back on its various channels and websites, it asks two more questions: &quot;Please let us know any opinions/comments you may have about the activities on the various [Resident Evil websites]&quot; and &quot;Let us know if there are any other Resident Evil games you want remade&quot;.

The update comes a decade after the game first debuted back in 2013, and means you no longer bruise your thumb as you spam the run button, tearing through Los Santos.

As spotted by TheGamer, that&#x27;s not the only quality-of-life improvement making its debut, either. Rather than claim all of your destroyed vehicles from Mors Mutal Insurance individually, you&#x27;ll now find an option to get it all over with at once. You can also add custom description tags in your garages to &quot;help quickly locate your favourite rides&quot;, and believe it or not, snow is also making its long-awaited debut in Creator.

Patch 1.0.2d is now live across all platforms and ushers in &quot;balance adjustments&quot; to classes.

&quot;We’ve made some balance adjustments to Classes and want to provide our reasoning behind them,&quot; Blizzard explains in the patch notes. &quot;Overall, we&#x27;re quite happy with the performance of our Classes, but we know there is always room for improvement. Our goal behind these changes is to create a better balanced and enjoyable experience across the board.

                              <span>One of the original programmers who was part of the volunteer effort to bring the Restored Content mod to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 – The Sith Lords says Aspyr Media &quot;did nothing wrong&quot; when it cancelled the DLC for Switch.

Aspyr Media revealed on Friday that Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 – The Sith Lords&#x27; highly-anticipated DLC, Restored Content, would now not be coming to Nintendo Switch after all. The team did not explain why the DLC would &quot;not be moving forward&quot;, and would not offer refunds either, instead choosing to offer a complimentary key for one of seven other Star Wars games.

As fans responded to the news, modder zbyl2 – who helped bring the Restored Content mod to PC in the first place – popped up in a comment on the KOTOR subreddit, saying: &quot;Aspyr did nothing wrong. Quote me on that. Shame it ended the way it did&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard is still investigating a problem that&#x27;s preventing players from logging into Diablo 4 on PS5 because of a &quot;valid license&quot; error.

It follows overnight woes with server authentication issues that froze the game after the character selection screen, locking players out for several hours regardless of the platform they were playing on.

&quot;We&#x27;re still looking into reports of folks getting this error,&quot; the Blizzard customer service team is currently telling players on social media. &quot;The Diablo community manager asked players to submit a ticket with their PSN IDs.&quot;

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 players are struggling to access their deluxe edition on PS5… while others are struggling to play at all.

Just hours after the game released, players flocked to the game&#x27;s subreddit and social media channels, reporting that despite having forked out for the fighter&#x27;s pricier editions, the game was stubbornly locking them out of the deluxe edition&#x27;s DLC and extras.

&quot;There seems to be some kind of ongoing problem with either the PS5 deluxe and ultimate editions or DLC in general,&quot; posits one Reddit mod, linking to a possible workaround&quot;.

                              <span>Remember last week when Team17 revealed a mysterious new game without telling us anything about it? Well, now we know it&#x27;s an all-new turn-based tactics war game called Classified: France &#x27;44.

Team17 Digital and Absolutely Games says the game is inspired by &quot;the untold story&quot; of the Jedburghs, &quot;a group of heroic Allied special forces dropped behind enemy lines&quot;, and the &quot;disparate brave Resistance groups&quot; working across France in the lead-up to the Normandy Landings on D-Day.

Here, check out this new teaser:

                              <span>Tender Claws has dropped an all-new trailer for its upcoming Stranger Things VR game, called – predictably enough – Stranger Things VR.

The stylised game sees you play the part of villain Vecna as you battle monsters, &quot;conquer minds&quot;, and exact your revenge. You can check it out in the teaser below:

The game&#x27;s premise is simple enough: &quot;Players will invade the dreams and memories of fan-favourite characters and harness telekinetic powers to possess minds and battle creatures, as Henry Creel’s transformation into Vecna and his influence on the events of prior seasons is revealed.&quot;

As well as the usual unspecified stability and crash fixes, a second hotfix released later that same day has also &quot;reduced the drop rate of the Elixir of Death Evasion recipe after it&#x27;s already learned&quot;, fixed items &quot;inheriting Junk status from gems socketed into them&quot;, and addressed an issue where &quot;Sorcerers could teleport underground in Serpent’s Passage&quot;.

The changes – which have been detailed on the official forums and the community subreddit – are live now. Here&#x27;s what you can expect when you boot up today:

                              <span>Blaze Entertainment has apologised after it was forced to acknowledge that artwork accompanying the announcement of a Duke Nukem collection – shown above – for Evercade was generated by AI.

In a brief statement, CEO Andrew Byatt insisted that the studio had commissioned an artist &quot;to produce a lead image for the new Duke Nukem 1+2 Remastered&quot; game, but &quot;because of &quot;the artists&#x27; use of AI in the process&quot;, it had &quot;fallen below the expectation and standards demanded by fans&quot;. 

Fans and professional artists were immediately suspicious when the artwork was first revealed, with some providing a breakdown of why the image – reportedly designed by &quot;professional hybrid concept artist&quot; Oskar Manuel – looked as though it had been machine-generated.

                              <span>The director of upcoming The Texas Chain Saw Massacre game wants us to know that Hollywood licensing is &quot;a total mess&quot; so Gun Interactive probably can&#x27;t add your favourite Texas Chain Saw character into the game.

CEO Wes Keltner broke the news on Twitter, offering a &quot;friendly reminder&quot; to players that despite their demands, Gun can&#x27;t add just any character or location from the movie series&#x27; considerable back catalogue because it doesn&#x27;t &quot;have those rights&quot;. 

&quot;Friendly reminder. We have the interactive rights to the 1974 film. We can&#x27;t put characters or locations in from other [Texas Chain Saw] films because we don&#x27;t have those rights,&quot; Keltner explained. &quot;Demanding we add them is not how Hollywood works. Licensing in general is usually a total mess.&quot;

Whilst the team confirmed that the DLC plans would &quot;not be moving forward&quot;, it did not offer an explanation as to why the content – which started out as a fan-made mod to restore content to the original game – had been scrapped. 

After thanking the KOTOR community for its &quot;immense passion and support for the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series&quot;, Aspyr said: &quot;Sadly, today we are announcing that the Restored Content DLC for the Nintendo Switch version of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 – The Sith Lords will not be moving forward for release&quot;.&quot;

                              <span>The Epic Games Store has booted Fallout: New Vegas up the bum and off its freebie list, making room for another free weekly title - which this time looks an awful lot like Midnight Ghost Hunt.


Midnight Ghost Hunt, from developer 
Vaulted Sky Games, is described as a &quot;chaotic multiplayer hide-and-seek game&quot; that casts one team of four as fearless Ghost Hunters and the other as naughty spirits intent on causing the former harm.


Ghost Hunters get the cool gadgets, as you might imagine, including a Spectrophone, Radar and Pathfinder for the spook detection bit, plus traps and vacuums to capture them, and a heap of more direct spectre-slaying tools, including sledgehammers, harpoons, and a cannon.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is off to a roaring start on Steam, having more than doubled the all-time record for concurrent players set by its nearest fighting game rival in less that 24 hours of release.


As flagged by Steam analyst Benji-Sales on Twitter, Street Fighter 6 has already secured a significant all-time concurrent peak on Valve&#x27;s storefront, recorded at 66,317 players by SteamCharts at the time of writing. The figure is more than twice that of its nearest fighting competitor, Mortal Kombat 11, which currently enjoys an all-time peak of 27,301 players.


Street Fighter 6&#x27;s concurrent peak is also leagues ahead of its direct predecessor, Street Fighter 5, which reached an all-time high of 13,807 players on Steam, and it&#x27;s also managed to outshine the likes of Tekken 7, whose all-time peak sits at 18,766 players

                              <span>As part of its Pride Month festivities, Microsoft has made developer Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s well-received queer mystery adventure Tell Me Why free to download and keep in its entirety on Xbox and PC, in what&#x27;s becoming a bit of a Pride tradition.


Tell Me Why, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the Alaskan town of Delos Crossing.


Their troubled past begins to resurface, though, and the slick mystery thriller gains a distinctly supernatural tinge (this is very definitely a spiritual sibling to Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s Life is Strange 1 &amp; 2), but Tell Me Why never loses sight of the beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists, even if it doesn&#x27;t quite reach the memorable highs of its forebears.

In a statement issued via Twitter today, Rebirth producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed development is progressing smoothly and a firm release date is now being considered. So that&#x27;s nice.


Square Enix has Rebirth listed for a &quot;winter 2023&quot; release. Up next from the publisher is the all-new Final Fantasy 16, which is released later this month.

Blizzard scribe Eric Covington says he wrote jokes &quot;lampooning generic corporate gree&quot; for the game&#x27;s Loot Specialist loot goblin, a character working for the in-game Venture Company.


However, Covington claims Blizzard leadership then &quot;saw a reflection&quot; in his words, and he was swiftly fired after nine years of service.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 fans have spotted its demo on the PlayStation Store, though it&#x27;s not available to download yet.


The listing, shared on reddit, suggests the demo is on the PSN and ready to go, but has only been seen by those who have pre-ordered the game in advance and when browsing on mobile. I&#x27;ve seen no mention of a demo on the console PSN myself.


Square Enix stated a demo was on the way, but no release date was given. So when might it arrive?

                              <span>Nintendo looks to be evoking the colour palette of the upcoming Barbie movie with a series of stylish pastel Switch Joy-Con colours. 


The four new looks will come as two new pairs: Pastel Pink/Pastel Yellow and Pastel Purple/Pastel Green. 


Both sets will launch on 30th June - which if you haven&#x27;t already seen, is also the release date of Nintendo&#x27;s quickly-announced 1-2-Switch sequel.

Everybody 1-2-Switch will cost just £25 - less than half the price of Zelda - and launch later this month on 30th June as  a physical and digital release. Pre-orders are open now.


Artwork for the game shows you&#x27;ll be able to play its mini-games using your Joy-Con controller or your smartphone. But details are thin on the ground as to what these mini-games will actually be.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 almost didn&#x27;t include moogles due to the game&#x27;s realistic style.


Not only was the team concerned the cute characters wouldn&#x27;t fit in the world, they also impacted the game&#x27;s performance mode.


&quot;Probably the greatest challenge, on a fundamental level, was the moogle,&quot; said producer Naoki Yoshida, in a new interview on the Square Enix blog.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve squeezed every last drop of spade-based fun from developer Vine and Yacht Club Games&#x27; Shovel Knight spin-off Pocket Dungeon, help is at hand! The extremely enjoyable adventure is poised to receive its &quot;gigantic&quot; free Puzzler&#x27;s Pack DLC next Tuesday, 6th June.


Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, sees the titular spade-wielding hero try his hand at block-falling puzzle-action. Across a procession of single-screen dungeons, players must dodge perpetually tumbling enemies and obstacles then smack chains of them into oblivion, keeping things clear long enough to eventually escape. It&#x27;s a lot more nuanced than that, though, and clever enough that Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan slapped its &quot;lovely balance of precision and chaos&quot; with a Recommended badge in 2022.

Anyway, the already surprisingly ample package is set to expand again on Tuesday, when Pocket Dungeon&#x27;s Puzzler&#x27;s Pack DLC arrives on PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile via Netflix. It adds Puzzle Knight and Mona as playable chracters - the first able to rotate surrounding foes clockwise to create new combos, the latter armed with alchemist abilities that can explode nearby potions - plus new battles, boons, bosses, feats, and a &quot;ton&quot; of relics.

                              <span>Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has asked fans not to share an early test build of Stalker 2, stolen and leaked online by Russian hackers as part of what it calls a &quot;year and a half&quot; attack.


GSC Game World - which relocated from Kyiv to Prague last year following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine - first confirmed it was the target of Russian hackers back in March, when it revealed an employee&#x27;s accounts was hacked and that the studio had been threatened with blackmail.


&quot;We are a Ukrainian company,&quot; it wrote at the time, &quot;and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile&quot;.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good day for VR fans eager for something new to shove in their goggles. Meta has aired its latest Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, featuring a whole bunch of announcements for VR games heading to Meta Quest 2 and the Meta Quest Pro in the coming months - including some very nice surprises. FuturLab&#x27;s splendid PowerWash Simulator is getting the VR treatment, for instance, as are a whole bunch of other familiar favourites, including Samba de Amigo, Bulletstorm, and even cult-classic CD-ROM puzzler The 7th Guest.


For a full rundown of everything revealed during tonight&#x27;s Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, along with a couple of promising additions that popped up during its pre-show, read on.

                              <span>As we teeter on the edge of Summer Game Fest and the Season of Big Announcements, Ubisoft is revving up for June&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase with a new trailer highlighting at least some of the games that&#x27;ll feature - and one vague tease that may or may not be Star Wars.


Ubisoft Forward, which is being broadcast live from Los Angeles - as good an excuse as any to resurrect that old Just Dance dance number, if you ask me - takes place on Monday, 12th June, at 6pm BST/10am PDT. A pre-show of undisclosed content will begin a quarter of an hour earlier.


The main event will feature a closer look at the publisher&#x27;s upcoming slate of releases, with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and The Crew Motorfest all now confirmed for a showing. We&#x27;ll probably also get at least some updates on Ubisoft&#x27;s raft of other lingering titles, including its free-to-play games and the perpetually delayed Skull and Bones - but not, as we recently heard, the now-rebooted Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.

                              <span>Following a swirl of reports earlier this year, Meta has made its latest consumer VR headset official; the Meta Quest 3 will launch this autumn, starting at a $499.99 USD price point.


Meta describes the Meta Quest 3 - which will be fully compatible with the existing Meta Quest 2 library - as the &quot;first mainstream headset with high-res colour mixed reality&quot;, and promises &quot;better displays and resolution&quot;, greater comfort, a 40 percent slimmer optic profile, and twice the graphics performance using &quot;next-gen Qualcomm chipset&quot;.


Its mixed reality feature set includes &quot;dual 4MP RGB colour cameras, a depth sensor for a more accurate representation of your play space, and 10x more pixels in Passthrough compared to Quest 2&quot;. Additionally, Meta has &quot;completely redesigned&quot; Quest 3&#x27;s Touch Plus controllers, dropping the outer tracking rings and adding &quot;TruTouch haptics&quot;.

                              <span>Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima almost cancelled Metal Gear Solid 2 and resigned from developer Konami following the events of the September 11th 2001 terrorist attack.


Kojima&#x27;s comments come from a recently-translated interview with magazine Weekly Toyo Keizai (thanks Games Radar), in which he states the game required 300 revisions following 9/11, leaving his team in &quot;crisis mode&quot;.



The end of the game has Arsenal Gear (a giant military fortress) crashing into Manhattan, but the final release shows only the before and after, with the rest left to the player&#x27;s imagination.

                              <span>Last week, Insomniac Games showed off Spider-Man 2&#x27;s seamless transitions between Peter Parker and fellow web-slinger Miles Morales. 


These moments in the sequel&#x27;s gameplay reveal were impressive, invoking memories of similar fluidity from Insomniac&#x27;s fellow PS5 exclusive Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. But I still had questions. Can we only switch characters at certain story points or will we be able to switch between them freely? 


It turns out, the answer is a little bit of both.

That&#x27;s according to a new report by Bloomberg, speaking to over a dozen anonymous developers who worked on the game.


Microsoft had billed Redfall as its next big exclusive game, but it ultimately proved a critical and commercial failure.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 on PC will include the controversial Denuvo DRM software.
The game&#x27;s Steam page was quietly updated on 30th May, three days ahead of the game&#x27;s release tomorrow, with mention of Denuvo Anti-Tamper. The change can be seen listed on SteamDB.
Denuvo&#x27;s software is known for its tendency to affect performance of games on PC. One of the most recent cases of this was Resident Evil Village, also developed by Capcom. Denuvo was finally patched out of Village in April this year.

No Man&#x27;s Sky for Mac machines was announced just under a year ago during Apple&#x27;s WWDC 2022 keynote, where it took centrestage as a bit of a poster child for the tech giant&#x27;s new Metal 3 API. At the time, it was expected to release before the end of the year (as was a version for iPad) but that ultimately slipped into 2023.


And now, a year and one ambitious Switch release later, Hello Games has confirmed No Man&#x27;s Sky arrives for Mac computers today, &quot;built from the ground up with a new rendering pipeline to take full advantage of Metal and Apple silicon&quot;.

                              <span>The fate of Disco Elysium 2 is currently up in the air, the boss of its development studio has stated, as part of a fresh report delving behind the scenes of the troubled company.


ZA/UM boss Ilmar Kompus made the statement in an interview with People Make Games, in which he was questioned on his buyout of shares in the company and whether or not Kompus illegally used company money to do so. The interview forms part of a longer documentary on the recent events surrounding Disco Elysium.


&quot;The status of this sequel is something that has been jeopardised by this PR campaign as such, and the conflict as such,&quot; Kompus said, referring to the publicity ZA/UM has faced from former employees in the past couple of years. Although the lawsuit filed by former executive producer Kaur Kender was dropped, the company is still in the midst of another legal battle against writer Robert Kurvitz, who claims he was, along with Aleksander Rostov and Helen Hindpere, fired &quot;under false premises&quot;.

It turns out this is due to a secret levelling system in the game that isn&#x27;t explicitly revealed.


YouTuber Austin John Plays has released a new video that dives into some of the details of this system (thanks for spotting, IGN).

                              <span>Activision Blizzard received 114 reports of harassment, discrimination or retaliation by its employees last year, with 29 of these being substantiated by investigators. 


In the company&#x27;s recently released transparency report, which was released into public domain following a request from stockholders (via Axios), Activision Blizzard stated it had taken over three dozen corrective actions as a result of these reports. 


These corrective measures included terminating workers for a variety of offences such as using discriminatory language, engaging in physical assault, misgendering others, unwanted advances, retaliation. It also included two cases of non-consensual touching.

                              <span>Konami has confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, its remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, will indeed reuse the original voices.

Previous information on the game had implied this, but was a little unclear. The initial press release stated the remake would &quot;star the original voice characters&quot;, while the official Metal Gear Twitter account said: &quot;The story and character voices in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remain the same from the original game&quot;.



Now Konami has stated the original voices will be used without changes.

                              <span>Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka has been sentenced to prison for insider trading.


Naka pleaded guilty in March and has now been sentenced to serve two and a half years in jail. In addition, Naka has been fined twice for ¥2.5m and ¥170m (just under £1m total).


However, his defence is seeking a suspended sentence and to lower the fines, claiming Naka &quot;accidentally saw information that was extremely unrelated to [his] work&quot;.

                              <span>The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red will lay off around 30 employees, as development on its card game spin-off Gwent winds down.


In a recent blog post, the developer reaffirmed its plan to place Gwent&#x27;s future into the hands of its community. 


&quot;The community has always been core to making the game what it is. That&#x27;s why we had the confidence to move ahead with GWENTfinity in the first place: there isn&#x27;t really anyone better to take charge of Gwent and see it move into a new era than you,&quot; CDPR wrote.

The layoffs occurred yesterday according to a report by Axios, with a representative for Firaxis publisher 2K Games telling the website the cuts were made due to a &quot;sharpening of focus, enhancements of efficiencies, and an alignment of our talent against our highest priorities&quot;.


These latest job cuts mark the second round of layoffs at the publisher this year. Back in March, Take-Two confirmed it was cutting jobs at Private Division - the publishing label behind OlliOlli World and Kerbal Space Program - alongside other unspecified parts of the company.

Grassetti joined Santa Monica Studio in 2013, following stints at BioWare as a character artist and at PlayStation as an art supervisor on a number of first-party games, eventually moving to a principal artist role on 2018&#x27;s God of War and, later, art director on its acclaimed sequel.


Grassetti confirmed his departure from Santa Monica Studio earlier this month, promising to reveal his next role soon. That day has now arrived, with Grassetti announcing he&#x27;s joined Netflix Games to work on a new AAA title alongside Staten (who left Microsoft in April), former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny, and ex-Coalition technical director Jerry Edsall.

                              <span>Sony has revealed June&#x27;s line-up of PlayStation Plus Essential titles, which this time around look an awful lot like Jurassic World Evolution 2, Trek to Yomi, and NBA 2K23.


Starting with Jurassic World Evolution 2 (PS4, PS5), it&#x27;s the sequel to Frontier Development&#x27;s decent if unremarkable 2018 theme park management sim, in which the genre&#x27;s usual selection of rides and amusements are switched out in favour of rather more deadly attractions. It&#x27;s a bit of an underwhelming follow-up, but it does offer a couple of improvements, including larger maps, more diverse biomes, and a new Chaos Theory mode revisiting key movie moments.


Trek to Yomi (PS4, PS5), meanwhile, comes from Shadow Warrior studio Flying Wild Hog, and takes players on an striking black-and-white adventure inspired by cinema&#x27;s classic samurai tales. In more practical terms, it blends side-scrolling platforming with sword combat - a mixture that didn&#x27;t quite grab Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese when he took a look last year.

                              <span>Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has stated the company has never had a &quot;systemic issue with harassment&quot; in a new interview with Variety.


His comments are in response to a lawsuit against the company by the State of California in 2021, claiming it had a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture. In the years since, a number of sexual harassment lawsuits have been filed and Kotick himself has been accused of turning a blind eye.


&quot;We&#x27;ve had every possible form of investigation done. And we did not have a systemic issue with harassment - ever. We didn&#x27;t have any of what were mischaracterisations reported in the media,&quot; Kotick told Variety. &quot;But what we did have was a very aggressive labour movement working hard to try and destabilise the company.&quot;

                              <span>Controversial military shooter Six Days in Fallujah will be released in Steam Early Access on 22nd June.


The game was previously delayed in 2021 into 2022, but now will launch with four co-operative four-player missions specifically focusing on &quot;the experiences of US Marine fireteams on the first day of the battle&quot;.



The game has been controversial since its first announcement due to its focus on realistically depicting the battle of Fallujah, one of the bloodiest battles in the US-led invasion of Iraq.

Players have speculated on the sexual orientation of these characters for years, but in a new short story comic Baptiste is confirmed as bisexual and Pharah is a lesbian.


The comic has been written by Jen Stacey, senior narrative designer for the game. Baptiste and Pharah join Tracer, Soldier: 76, and Lifeweaver as LGBT+ characters in the game.

                              <span>A new item duplication glitch has been discovered in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

Numerous glitches have been found in the game that allow players to duplicate any item, though these were patched out in the latest update.




Now, since the update, a new glitch has been discovered in version 1.1.2, though it&#x27;s a bit more long-winded.

                              <span>It looks like Microsoft and PlayGround Games are getting ready to give us a fresh glimpse at Fable.


A new post on the console&#x27;s official Twitter account showed an Xbox controller covered in glitter. Curious. 


From the controller, a trail, still in glitter, leads along the floor, over the kitchen sink, up the stairs and across a desk all the way up to a monitor displaying the Xbox Games Showcase home screen.  While this is all going on, nostalgic music tinkers along in the background.

                              <span>Konami has confirmed that Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima is not involved in the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, Delta.


Kojima and Konami had a public fallout before the developer launched his own studio, Kojima Productions, so this news doesn&#x27;t come as a huge surprise.


Speaking to IGN, a Konami spokesperson confirmed Kojima Productions is not involved, but the developer of the remake is Virtuos who worked on Dark Souls Remastered and Uncharted 4.

First up is Grunge Revival Kit, which, as its name suggests, whisks players back to the 90s, for a clothing-focused pack themed around &quot;the unpolished, the imperfect, and the free-spirited&quot;.


EA is yet to detail the DLC&#x27;s exact contents, but expect &quot;worn textures, layered options, and bold accessories&quot;, ranging from old band tees and baggie hoodies to faded jeans.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re keen for a nose around Mortal Kombat 1 - and to play a part, however small, in making sure the whole thing doesn&#x27;t immediately fall over on launch day - you might be interested to know registrations for the fighter&#x27;s upcoming online stress test are now open.


Mortal Kombat 1 finally got its proper unveiling in May, with NetherRealm confirming it to be a reboot of sorts set in a &quot;reborn&quot; universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang.


The full game is scheduled to release on 19th September but, before then, NetherRealm and publisher Warner Bros. are giving players a couple of opportunities to put a limited build through its paces; those who pre-order Mortal Kombat 1 can participate in a beta test happening in August, and there&#x27;s also a newly announced &quot;online stress test&quot; on the way.

The CMA made the shock decision to block Microsoft proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard in April, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;.


And now, following the recent publication of Microsoft&#x27;s summary of application to appeal the CMA&#x27;s decision - in which it accused the UK regulator of making &quot;fundamental errors in its assessment&quot; - the UK&#x27;s Competition Appeal Tribunal has held a case management conference to iron out preliminary details of the hearing between Microsoft and the CMA.

                              <span>A design for an airbike in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has become hugely popular for its simplicity and ease of use.

Traversing the vast space of Hyrule (and the Depths) can be a bit of a slog on foot or horse, but one vehicle has easily solved this problem.

The airbike, as demonstrated by YouTuber Uncle Dane, only requires two fans and one steering stick, which can be easily gotten from Zonai Device Dispensers or found scattered about.

In a new blog post on Steam, the Iron Gate team noted it&#x27;s been receiving &quot;a lot of questions regarding mods&quot; and addressed some issues around the modding scene.


The game doesn&#x27;t have any official mod support, but the team is flattered and &quot;definitely happy to see that people are engaging with our game&quot;.

                              <span>Link&#x27;s Ascend ability in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a particularly useful addition, but have you ever wondered exactly how it works?


When ascending, Link is transported through rock via, seemingly, a loading screen of darkness and green swirls.


Thanks to a new video from YouTube channel Boundary Break, we can see what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes.

Developer CD Projekt Red announced this latest milestone during its recent earnings call. Here, CDPR exec Adam Kicinski also revealed the Witcher trilogy combined has now sold in excess of 75m copies. 


&quot;This clearly shows the strength of the franchise and we are excited looking forward to our next projects within the Witcher universe,&quot; he said on these latest figures.

                              <span>CD Projekt, developer of The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077, has dismissed speculation it will be bought by Sony. 


Online reports had suggested the maker of PlayStation was interested in snapping up CD Projekt for itself, apparently based on a rumour spread by a well-known Destiny leaker. 


CD Projekt has previously insisted the studio wished to remain independent. And now, in an investor call, CD Projekt boss Adam Kicinski has ruled out the developer being available to buy.

                              <span>It’s neither hard nor expensive:
Unlike password authentication, which requires a direct match between what is inputted and what’s stored in a database, fingerprint authentication determines a match using a reference threshold. As a result, a successful fingerprint brute-force attack requires only that an inputted image provides an acceptable approximation of an image in the fingerprint database. BrutePrint manipulates the false acceptance rate (FAR) to increase the threshold so fewer approximate images are accepted.
BrutePrint acts as an adversary in the middle between the fingerprint sensor and the trusted execution environment and exploits vulnerabilities that allow for unlimited guesses...</span>

That&#x27;s according to a new leak that backs up the report with what&#x27;s claimed to be a screenshot of a loading screen proving that a Transformer crossover event is on the way.

It&#x27;s just one of a slew of rumours that are currently circulating, though, and gives credence to prior leaks that Chapter 4 Season 3 may include a tropical biome courtesy of the jungle-esque backdrop included in the screenshot.

                              <span>Team17 has unveiled a mysterious new project, Redacted.

Whether that&#x27;s the game&#x27;s final name or a placeholder we have no idea, as the press release itself is almost entirely redacted too, telling us only that someone – or something – in the game is &quot;preparing for deployment&quot;.

Thankfully, the accompanying cinematic video – albeit also entitled Redacted – gives us a little more information, intimating that the game is set during war time when the platoon was &quot;out-manned and out-gunned&quot;.

                              <span>THQ Nordic has reached out to Remedy and offered to partner up to make Alan Wake 2 available as a physical release.

Reminding the developer that it had facilitated physical versions &quot;back in the day&quot; for the original game, THQ Nordic said it would &quot;love to go at it again&quot;.

Remedy anticipated questions about its digital-only release, it seems, as it included the decision in an FAQ shared earlier this week.

&quot;Players will be able to show their loyalty to the Emperor with the Lieutenant Titus trinket, whilst traitors and heretics will be able to show their Xenos leanings with the Hormangaunt Tyranid trinket,&quot; the team explains.

Whilst that hasn&#x27;t been explicitly confirmed by developer Gameloft, a new social media post shows an abandoned wand sitting on an ornate &quot;artisanal&quot; stone bench, leading many players to speculate that it may belong to... and a lot of &quot;bibbidi bobbidi boo&quot; messages and memes. 

&quot;New items are coming to a Valley near you with Update 5. For instance, no wooded path is truly complete without an artisanal bench,&quot; the team tweeted over the weekend.

Of the 4000 female gamers surveyed by Sky Broadband, 49 per cent report having been abused or harrassed when streaming or playing online, although this rises to 75 per cent for women aged 18-24. 

80 per cent of those affected by online abuse confirmed that the messages and comments were sexual in nature, and 35 per cent was violent.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s all-new Riot Mode is now available.

Designed to allow players &quot;test their mettle and compete for high scores&quot;, the sci-fi horror&#x27;s third DLC, The Riot Bundle also includes The Prospector Skin Collection and 11 new enemy death animations.

Riot Mode sees Jacob in &quot;an isolated corner of the prison, just three rooms and connecting hallways that contain loot crates full of health gel packs, health injectors, GRP batteries, and ammuniton&quot;, the team explains. Equipped with a stun baton, a hand cannon, a riot gun, and your handy GRP, you&#x27;ll need to survive &quot;endless waves of biophage enemies who vary in strength and composition&quot;.

&quot;I don&#x27;t know the exact date for everything,&quot; they explained in messages posted to The Snitch&#x27;s Discord channel,&quot; but I&#x27;ll just say there&#x27;s a new SH2R, Townhall [sic] &amp; Ascension trailer ready to be revealed at last.&quot;

It&#x27;s also teased a new &quot;brand-new single-player experience&quot; currently in the works.


Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us multiplayer project was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but the studio announced it was separating the two halves in 2019. Since then, updates on the multiplayer game have been sparse, with Naughty Dog popping up to confirm &quot;we&#x27;re working on it&quot; in 2021 and then, last year, promising more would be revealed in 2023.


Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann reiterated the studio&#x27;s intention to share more about the game &quot;later this year&quot; back in January, but a new statement from the developer suggests its plans for a more substantial reveal in 2023 may currently be on hold.

Roots of Pacha, which launched to an extremely positive reception back in April, was pulled from Valve&#x27;s storefront by publisher Crytivo earlier this month - a move developer Soda Den claimed had occurred &quot;&quot;without [its] knowledge or consent&quot;.


&quot;We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally,&quot; it said at the time. &quot;Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorised them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam&quot;. Crytivo, meanwhile, claimed Soda Den had unexpectedly moved to &quot;unilaterally rescind the contract we had worked under for three years&quot;.

                              <span>Just as it said it would, Microsoft has appealed the CMA&#x27;s decision to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and its summary of arguments is now available for scrutiny.

                              <span>Daedalic Entertainment, the studio behind the recently released and critically lambasted The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, has reportedly received funding from the German government to develop a second Lord of the Rings title.


As spotted by German website Wirtschaft (thanks Gamesradar), Daedalic has been awarded a €2m grant - approximately £1.7m - by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs to work on what appears to be a second game in J. R. R. Tolkein&#x27;s beloved fantasy universe.


The project, which is currently listed under the codename &quot;It&#x27;s magic&quot; on the Ministry of Economic Affairs&#x27; website, is described (via Google Translate) as a game that will transport players to a &quot;lush world full of mythical creatures and magic&quot; and tell a &quot;story from a character&#x27;s perspective that has never been told before.&quot;

                              <span>Minecraft&#x27;s long-awaited Trails and Tales Update will launch for all platforms on Wednesday, 7th June. 


This is the update which adds bamboo and cherry trees, the latter of which can be found in a new, rare Overworld biome: The Cherry Grove. 


Two new mobs are also joining Minecraft in this update, including camels (large enough to seat two players at once) and Sniffers.

                              <span>With the season of announcements almost upon us, we&#x27;re starting to get a much clearer idea of the whats, whos, and, equally importantly, whens, of when the whos will be showing their whats. And in that spirit, developer Turn 10 has now revealed its latest Forza Motorsport game, bound for Xbox Series X/S and PC, will be getting two showings in June.


Forza Motorsport&#x27;s first appearance will occur almost exactly a year after its official unveiling, during Microsoft&#x27;s big Xbox Games Showcase for 2023, which kicks off on 11th June at 6pm BST. Here, Turn 10 will, as detailed on Twitter, be giving onlookers an &quot;up-close look at the cars&quot; they&#x27;ll be a-whizzing in when launch day finally arrives.


Then, with that presumably comparatively swift segment out the way, Turn 10 will be going it alone with its own Forza Monthly showcase on 13th June. Here, it&#x27;ll be serving up a &quot;full walkthrough of [Forza Motorsports&#x27;s] single-player career gameplay&quot;.

                              <span>Movie star Dolph Lundgren has let slip he&#x27;s set to star in a Witcher spin-off TV show.


Lundgren, perhaps most famous for playing boxer Ivan Drago in Rocky 4, told Swedish publication Aftonbladet he&#x27;s in South Africa shooting a spinoff series of The Witcher, which Collider speculates is the upcoming show about the Rats.


The Rats are a group of young Nilfgaardian thieves introduced in Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s Time of Contempt
novel. The third season of The Witcher (the last starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia), adapts this book, and so the expectation is the Rats will be introduced to fans of the show before their spin-off hits the screen.

If you answered yes to that question, well I have some good news. The officially-licenced Mega Man slippers will be available this summer (23rd June, to be precise). 


Clothing and costume store Fun has unveiled this new pair of Mega Man slippers, which have been designed to resemble Mega Man&#x27;s classic series look. They have a stitched Mega Man on the side, and red emblems on the sole. Surely, a much more comfortable option for lounging around the house in than Mega Man&#x27;s own, robotic booties.

This collection will include the first three Metal Gear Solid games - Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (both HD Collection versions), and will launch in the autumn.


However, the Konami website for the collection includes a blank space with &quot;stay tuned for more information&quot;, which the PlayStation Store has revealed will be Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.

                              <span>The boss of the European Commission has explained in detail why her agency approved Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal - and why she thinks the UK was wrong to block it.


In a speech given yesterday, European Commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager laid out the regulator&#x27;s own &quot;call of duty&quot; to only block buyouts when really necessary.


&quot;Merger control is by nature a forward-looking exercise,&quot; Vestager said. &quot;But that power comes with challenges... And to make things even more complicated, for global deals many authorities are predicting the future, at the same time. Of course we cooperate, but disagreements sometimes happen. No less recently than last week, we cleared the Microsoft/Activision deal, while the CMA decided to block it.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has released a new patch for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that appears to remove item duplication glitches.


The patch notes themselves are minimal, stating some audio bug fixes, a fix to the quest &#x27;Camera Work in the Depths&#x27;, and &quot;several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience&quot;.


It&#x27;s this last point that presumably covers the duplication glitches that seem to have been removed.

Yes, it&#x27;s a board game based on the Space Marine video game, which itself is based on Games Workshop&#x27;s famous tabletop game.


The video below shows the Space Marine board game box as well as some miniatures, including a slightly awkward-looking Lieutenant Titus, star of the Space Marine video games.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve not heard much from THQ Nordic&#x27;s Alone in the Dark reboot since its surprise unveiling last year, but now the promising project is back with a 25th October release date and - for the impatient among us - a playable prologue that&#x27;s available now.


The original Alone in the Dark, for those too young to remember, released in 1992 and offered a genuinely groundbreaking journey into the unknown. It&#x27;s widely considered to be the granddaddy of the survival horror genre, pioneering the fixed-camera spook-house formula that would go on to influence the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.


THQ Nordic&#x27;s reimagined version of Alone in the Dark - which is being handled by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive with Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent writer Mikael Hedberg at the helm - takes the basic premise of the 1992 original, in which private detective Edward Carnby helps Emily Hartwood investigate her uncle&#x27;s suicide at the gloomy Derceto Mansion, and cranks up the Southern Gothic as it attempts to filter the originals&#x27; blend of exploration, combat, puzzles, and story through a more modern lens.

                              <span>Gearbox has announced a significant delay for Homeworld 3, moving the long-in-the-works real-time strategy sequel&#x27;s launch out of the &quot;first half of 2023&quot; and into February 2024.


Homeworld 3 is being developed by Blackbird Interactive and marks the first new numbered game in the series since Relic Entertainment&#x27;s Homeworld 2 in 2003. However, news of its progress has been erratic following its official unveiling by publisher Gearbox in August 2019.


After an extended silence, the tail-end of 2021 bought a Q4 2022 launch window, but that then slipped to the &quot;first half of 2023&quot; so Blackbird could deliver the game &quot;at the highest quality&quot;. Now, however, with time to hit its most recent release target rapidly running out, Gearbox has announced another delay, this time shifting Homeworld 3&#x27;s release into early next year.

                              <span>Developer The Gentlebros&#x27; adorable quick-fire action-RPG series Cat Quest is back for a third open-world adventure, this time taking to the high seas in Cat Quest: Pirates of the Purribean, which is set to release on PC and consoles sometime next year.


The original Cat Quest released in 2017, sending players, in the role of a brave feline warrior, on a quest to save their kidnapped sister. It was a wonderfully refreshing thing, taking everything you&#x27;d expect from an action-RPG - real-time combat, dungeon crawling, and equipment progression - and turning it into a breezy, super-streamlined, pick-up-and-play package. It also had more cat puns than is probably legal.


A sequel arrived two years later, offering a slightly evolved take on the original&#x27;s formula - most notably introducing dogs (and, yes, dog puns) - and now The Gentlebros is getting ready to do it all over again in Cat Quest: Pirates of the Purribean.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase event, and offer our thoughts on everything that was shown - and not shown - last night.

We got an extended look at Spider-Man 2, and announcements of the much-rumoured Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, Bungie&#x27;s next game Marathon, Haven&#x27;s first title Fairgame$, and something called Concord. Actual gameplay and firm release dates were thin on the ground, however. And many of the games shown during PlayStation&#x27;s event will also be available on Xbox.  
Was this a good games event, even if it wasn&#x27;t a great PlayStation one? How do we feel about Sony&#x27;s game roadmap now? Joining me to discuss all of that and much more are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Consider this your last-minute reminder that the annual Summer Games Done Quick is back this weekend, bringing another seven days of charity speedrunning action.


Things kick of this Sunday, 28th May, at 5.30pm BST for a bit of pre-show pre-amble, with the main speedrunning event getting underway half an hour later, beginning with AlphaDolphin&#x27;s Any% run of Sonic Frontiers. From there, things continue onward throughout the week until proceedings wind down at around 9.25am on Sunday, 4th June.


As ever, Summer Games Done Quick&#x27;s full speedrunning schedule is an eclectic thing, covering retro classics, indie favourites, and triple-A blockbusters, with a few welcome oddities thrown in.

                              <span>If all this bright blue sky and golden sunshine is getting you down, why not retreat into the murky brown post-apocalypse, courtesy of developer Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s acclaimed Fallout: New Vegas, which is currently free on the Epic Games Store?


Fallout: New Vegas is, of course, sensibly considered something of a classic, with Obsidian&#x27;s open-world RPG refining and enriching the series&#x27; first trek into 3D - as seen in Bethesda Softworks&#x27; Fallout 3 - into an experience Eurogamer called &quot;huge and sprawling, sometimes gaudy, even downright ugly at times – but always effortlessly, shamelessly entertaining&quot;.


&quot;Obsidian has created a totally compelling world,&quot; contributor Dan Whitehead wrote in his 9/10 review back in 2010, &quot;and its frustrations pale into insignificance compared to the immersive, obsessive experience on offer.

In China, chicken fans are getting something a bit funkier: Tetris. A chicken nugget shaped McDonald&#x27;s toy which runs Tetris, to be precise.


The promotion was spotted by Retro Dodo, and McDonald&#x27;s Chinese website has more details on where people can get one (and why Tetris).

                              <span>Blizzard has explained why it took the decision not to extend the Diablo 4 campaign story with its post-launch seasons.


Speaking to Eurogamer in a recent interview, associate game director Joe Piepiora outlined how story will work as part of Diablo 4&#x27;s quarterly seasonal releases, which are separate from the planned release of traditional Diablo expansions.

Unlike Diablo 3, Diablo 4 seasons include self-contained storylines that expand the world of Sanctuary, rather than continue the main campaign. The continuation of the story is reserved for expansions.

However, this game is set in 1919 and features animals and humans together. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Last night&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase brought us plenty of teasers for upcoming games - even if many of them were CGI. Among them was the briefest of announcements for Concord, the debut game from FireWalk Studios.


Clocking in at just 50 seconds, Concord&#x27;s reveal trailer gives little away. An accompanying blog post offers only a little more detail. 


Concord will be a PVP first-person shooter set in space, headed to PS4 and PS5 in 2024.

                              <span>An official reveal of The Talos Principle 2 was one of the many announcements during last night&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase.


The Talos Principle first came out in 2014 on PC, and was followed up with DLC called Road to Gehenna and ports to Xbox One, PS4, Switch and mobile.


The sequel was first announced in 2016, developer Alen Ladavac sneakily slipped the news in at the end of his talk at that year&#x27;s Nordic Game conference.

                              <span>There were plenty of announcements during Sony&#x27;s Playstation Showcase last night, but the one that stood out most to me was Phantom Blade Zero. This quickfire action RPG looks brilliant and oh so slick. It blends Chinese martial arts and punk together, to create a new direction its developer has dubbed &quot;Kungfupunk&quot;.


In Phantom Blade Zero, you take on the role of Soul. According to Soulframe Liang, founder of the game&#x27;s developer S-Game, Soul is &quot;an elite assassin serving an elusive but powerful organisation known simply as &#x27;The Order&#x27;.&quot; Soul was framed for the murder of this organisation&#x27;s patriarch, and was then wounded in the &quot;manhunt that ensued&quot;. Thankfully, he was saved from death by a &quot;mystic healer&quot;. 


This all sounds enticing enough already, in my opinion, but there is more. While Soul may have been saved by this healer, there is a catch - the cure only lasts for 66 days, and Soul needs to find out who framed him for killing The Order&#x27;s patriarch before time runs out. Of course, this will not be an easy job, and Soul will have to fight against &quot;powerful foes and inhuman monstrosities&quot; on his journey. You can see how it all looks in the trailer below.

                              <span>Beat Saber is finally available now on Sony&#x27;s PS VR2 headset.


The game was announced for the platform at the start of the year, but missed out on February&#x27;s launch.



Then, at last night&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase, the game was made immediately available alongside a new pack of Queen songs.

                              <span>Microsoft has cheekily pointed to the fact that many of tonight&#x27;s big PlayStation Showcase announcements were also games you can play on Xbox Series X/S.


MGS3 remake Metal Gear Solid Delta, Bungie&#x27;s new Marathon project, Alan Wake 2, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage and Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 might not have featured Xbox logos in their trailers during Sony&#x27;s show - but they are all coming to Xbox, as noted by tweet from Microsoft.


That tweet - posted right after Sony&#x27;s show finished - is clearly meant as a bit of fun. But it does also highlight just how much of tonight&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase will be available elsewhere.

                              <span>Bungie has released a teaser trailer for Destiny 2: The Final Shape, the &quot;final chapter of the Light &amp; Darkness Saga&quot;.


It sees the surprise return of Cayde-6, one of Destiny&#x27;s most popular characters. It&#x27;s been four expansions since Destiny players waved farewell to Cayde, the wise-cracking Hunter originally played by Nathan Fillion who was shot dead by Uldren Sov. He even got a touching memorial players can visit in Destiny 2&#x27;s Tower hub.


The CGI trailer begins with Warlock chief Ikora Rey staring into a campfire, talking to Cayde as if he&#x27;s still alive. &quot;You&#x27;ve missed so much,&quot; she says, sadly. &quot;I wish you could have been there.&quot;

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s hotly-anticipated PlayStation Showcase is over, and we now have a clearer idea of what PlayStation 5 and PSVR2 owners can expect to hit their hardware over the next year. We got a lot of what we expected (Spider-Man 2, Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, Final Fantasy 16) and more than a few surprises.
In case you missed it, or if you just fancy a recap, here&#x27;s everything announced during the show, including all the trailers, reveals and release dates. There&#x27;s a lot to get through, so let&#x27;s begin!


PlayStation Showcase kicked off with a cinematic trailer for Haven&#x27;s PlayStation exclusive Fairgame$. It&#x27;s described as a &quot;competitive modern heist game where you team up to break into exotic locations and steal the cargo&quot;.

The release date remains autumn 2023, but the trailer showed both Miles Morales and Peter Parker as playable characters and the ability to switch between them.


Both characters have plenty of new abilities too, which you can check out in the set piece-heavy trailer below.

                              <span>Well! Bungie has finally unveiled its next project, and it&#x27;s quite a surprise, whisking the developer back to its 90s roots for a revival of its classic first-person shooter series Marathon, reimagined as a PvP shooter for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


The original Marathon released in 1994 and went on to spawn two sequels, at which point Microsoft swooped in to purchase Bungie and the Halo franchise was born. Since then, Bungie has been on a quite the journey, working its way through multiple Halo sequels and two Destiny games, the latter of which have kept the studio busy for over a decade. So it&#x27;s kind of fascinating to see it cast its gaze backward for its first new project as a Sony-owned studio.


The new Marathon is described as a &quot;sci-fi PvP extraction shooter&quot; featuring &quot;evolving, persistent zones&quot; that, while not a direct sequel to the earlier games, is set in the same universe. &quot;PvP&quot; is the key here, too with Bungie confirming it won&#x27;t have a single-player campaign. It will, however, support cross-play and cross-save between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

                              <span>UPDATE: In a FAQ shared following tonight&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 release date news, Remedy has announced the long-awaited horror sequel will be a digital-only release on all platforms and that there are &quot;currently no plans to release Alan Wake 2 on disc&quot;.


&quot;There are many reasons for this,&quot; the developer explained. &quot;For one, a large number of have shifted to digital only. You can buy a Sony PlayStation 5 without a disc drive and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Series S is a digital only console. It is not uncommon to release modern games as digital-only.&quot; It also argued &quot;not releasing a disc helps keep the price of the game at $59.99/€59.99 and the PC version at $49.99/€49.99&quot;, and insisted it &quot;did not want to ship a disc product and have it require a download for the game&quot;.


Alan Wake 2 will be available in two versions at launch: a standard edition costing £39.99/€49.99/$49.99 USD on PC and £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 on consoles, plus a deluxe edition priced at £54.99/€69.99/$69.99 on PC and £64.99/€79.99/$79.99 on consoles.

                              <span>If you enjoyed ThatGameCompany&#x27;s seminal Journey, and you loved Giant Squid Studios&#x27; Abzû, then you might very well like the latter developer&#x27;s newly announced Sword of the Sea, which looks like both of those games lovingly squished together into a brand-new whole.


Sword of the Sea is Giant Squid&#x27;s third release - following on from 2016&#x27;s deep sea adventure Abzû and 2020&#x27;s The Pathless - and its announcement trailer, aired during Sony&#x27;s latest PlayStation Showcase, focuses on a lone explorer, known as The Wraith, sand-surfing their way through a strikingly rendered desert, all undulanting sands and ancient temples, that suddenly gives way to roaring waves and flying marine life.


Giant Squid&#x27;s creative director Matt Nava (who served as art director on Journey, in case you&#x27;re wondering why the art style looks familiar) calls Sword of the Sea the studio&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious game to date&quot; on the PlayStation Blog, noting its &quot;Hoversword&quot; traversal sytem - a mix of &quot;snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one&quot; - is core to the experience.

                              <span>The creator of sad indie Gris, Nomada Studio, has revealed its next game: Neva.


Revealed at Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase, the game has a gorgeous artstyle and - as you might expect - has a particularly melancholic and ethereal tone.


Though no gameplay was shown, the trailer features a young woman and her giant pet wolf who battles an incoming horde of demons.

The answer to all of that is called Fairgame$, yes, with a dollar sign in its name. 


Fairgame$ looks to be a heist shooter starring a plucky group of youths seeking to steal riches from the, er, rich. Said group have a bunch of cool gadgets, and bright pink smoke bombs. Watch its cinematic reveal trailer just below:

                              <span>Three and a half years after its announcement, numerous delays, and a new developer later, Ubisoft&#x27;s beleaguered Price of Persia: Sands of Time remake is still in the &quot;conception&quot; phase.


Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;fully-fledged&quot; Sands of Time remake was officially revealed in September 2020, with an anticipated release date of January the following year. However, its troubled development saw the publisher twice delay its release, before finally shifting control of the project from Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.


Following that major upheaval in May 2022, Ubisoft would only say its Sands of Time remake would release &quot;when it&#x27;s ready&quot;. However, a new development update on the Ubisoft website now suggests that &quot;ready&quot; may still be some considerable way off.

                              <span>As Netflix&#x27;s live-action The Witcher adaptation prepares for its return on 29th June, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich has shared a little more on Henry Cavill&#x27;s decision to hang up his shoulder-length Geralt wig after season 3, admitting the team &#x27;had the choice to end the show&#x27; after Cavill&#x27;s departure, but felt there were &quot;just too many stories left to tell&quot;.


Netflix revealed The Witcher&#x27;s third season would be Cavill&#x27;s last in October 2022, much to the disappointment of fans - Cavill has, afterall, been one of the few genuinely bright spots in a deeply uneven adaptation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the show&#x27;s popularity, Netflix confirmed that instead of winding the series down it had instead recast the lead role, with Liam Hemsworth stepping into Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s shoes for season 4 onward.


Now, however, in an interview with Total Film (thanks Games Radar), showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich has confirmed the team was given the option to wrap the series up with Cavill&#x27;s departure, but instead opted to press on. &quot;I mean, we had the choice to have Geralt exit and to end the show,&quot; Hissirch explained, &quot;[but] that&#x27;s not something that we were willing to do. There&#x27;s just too many stories left to tell.&quot;

                              <span>Stealthy Japanese retailers appear to have outed the release date of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage - the upcoming Baghdad-set entry in Ubisoft&#x27;s historical stabathon series.


A series of Japanese stores now have Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage available to pre-order, with a release date set for 12th October. Ubisoft is yet to officially name a date for the game, though this would line up with previous Assassin&#x27;s Creed launches. 


Japanese gaming website Gematsu noted on Twitter this afternoon that retailers in the country do not typically list titles with placeholder dates. The same day being listed across various major retailer chains also points to the date being legitimate.

                              <span>It&#x27;s sort of summertime which means it&#x27;s sort of press conference time which means Sony&#x27;s doing a PlayStation Showcase tonight, and you can watch it right here with us from 9pm UK time. That&#x27;s 10pm CEST or 1pm PDT / 4pm EDT.
The show will be an hour long, apparently, and I&#x27;ll be live reporting everything going on while chatting with you in the comments, because I have four hands.
So what can we expect? Well, Final Fantasy 16 will no doubt feature highly, what with it being a timed exclusive for PlaySation 5 and all, and with it being due next month. Will we get a demo date, perhaps? I&#x27;d also expect a solid look at Insomniac&#x27;s new Spider-Man 2 game, due this autumn, which we still haven&#x27;t seen a great deal of.

Ryan did however say that cloud gaming would be &quot;fundamental&quot; to allow Sony to &quot;exploit that trend of mobility&quot;.

While Berry&#x27;s part is not yet set in stone (be that cuboid or otherwise), should these negotiations follow through, the actor will be joining Aquaman and Fast X&#x27;s Jason Momoa on the big, blocky, screen.


Last year, it was revealed this upcoming Minecraft film had also landed Napoleon Dynamite&#x27;s Jared Hess as its director. Meanwhile, Dune producer Mary Parent will produce the film, alongside Roy Lee.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has confirmed there are no plans to release DLC.


In an interview with Game Informer, Yoshida stated the game is a one-off - though there&#x27;s always potential for more if players fall in love with the world of Valisthea.



The lack of DLC proves the development team&#x27;s commitment to delivering a complete story with this game, following criticisms of previous series entries.

A Metal Gear Solid 3 remake was first rumoured in October 2021, when it was claimed Virtuos, a studio primarily known for its porting work, had been handed the development reins by Konami. The project has popped up intermittently since then, albeit never officially confirmed, and now Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden says he&#x27;s been able to &quot;hard-confirm&quot; it&#x27;s real.


Corden also lends credence to a recent report by Insider Gaming, which claimed the remake would be a multi-platform release, contrary to speculation Sony might have snaffled it up as a PlayStation exclusive. According to Corden, the remake will indeed be coming to Xbox and PC alongside PlayStation, &quot;despite a marketing deal&quot;.

Netflix has been threatening a crackdown on password sharing as a means of shoring up is stagnating subscriber numbers for some time now, and it began rolling out a related series of measures built around the notion of a designated &quot;primary location&quot; in February, albeit initially only in a limited number of countries.


Since then, Netflix&#x27;s measures have continued to spread around the globe, and, as of today, are live in the UK. The streaming service says it has started emailing members that share their accounts with users outside their household, telling them they&#x27;ll need to cough up an additional £4.99 a month if they want to continue doing so.

&quot;Relic Entertainment and Sega Europe want to share the difficult news that our studio has been impacted by layoffs, affecting 121 employees,&quot; Relic wrote. &quot;This comes at a time when external factors are challenging our industry more than ever, and we made this decision to restructure our organisation to ensure maximum focus is placed on our core franchises.&quot;

                              <span>Destiny 2&#x27;s latest season arrives today, and alongside the usual Destiny stuff, Bungie is finally leaning into its Sony acquisition with a bunch of new PlayStation-inspired premium cosmetics, including some Cordyceps business and Kratos-inspired armour.


As far as the Destiny specific stuff goes, Season of the Deep (as today&#x27;s update is known) is themed around Saturn&#x27;s moon of Titan, where an uncharted ocean awaits. It introduces weekly Deep Dive missions, the Salvage seasonal activity, and fishing for Season Pass purchasers, while Lightfall + Annual Pass or Lightfall Dungeon Key owners gain access to a mysterious new dungeon - the first of two due this year - starting this Friday, 26th May.


As for Destiny 2&#x27;s PlayStation collaboration, that&#x27;s happening over on the premium store, where Bungie has shoved a bunch of cosmetics inspired by Sony&#x27;s biggest games. With interest still high after its barnstorming TV adaptation, The Last of Us gets the most representation here, with a three-item Cordyceps Bundle featuring everyone&#x27;s favourite fungi to be with. Specifically, there&#x27;s the Clicker (Ghost), Blooming Terror (Ship), and Quarantine Runner (Sparrow).

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) makes managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles within Kubernetes easier than ever. It allows cluster
administrators to define the profiles in a predefined custom resource YAML,
which then gets distributed by the SPO into the whole cluster. Modification and
removal of the security profiles are managed by the operator in the same way,
but that’s a small subset of its capabilities.
Another core feature of the SPO is being able to stack seccomp profiles. This
means that users can define a baseProfileName in the YAML specification, which
then gets automatically resolved by the operator and combines the syscall rules.

                              <span>Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka has said Niantic is now considering measures to address &quot;many of the valid concerns&quot; surrounding its recent decisions to adjust the game.


The app recently introduced sweeping changes to its remote raiding feature, with players limited to using five remote raid passes a day, and each pass also now priced higher. Niantic said it had made these changes with the future of Pokémon Go in mind, and to ensure the game was still focused on its core pillars of exploration and social interaction.


But alongside criticism of Niantic&#x27;s decision - which Steranka told Eurogamer last week in an interview that he had fully expected - the company&#x27;s employees have also been targeted with personal abuse. Today, Steranka took to Twitter to highlight one such example.

It has additionally fined Plaion the same sum for omitting to tell the ratings board its Limited Bounty Hunter Edition of Hunt: Showdown also contained paid random items. 


&quot;Since this amounts to a violation of the rules described in the PEGI Code of Conduct, the PEGI Enforcement Committee sanctioned both companies with a fine of 5000€,&quot; PEGI has stated.

Two Spider-Men join Fortnite today, including fan-favourite Miles Morales in his Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse guise. Joining him is Spider-Man 2099 - aka Irish-Mexican Spidey-person Miguel O&#x27;Hara. 


Both Spider-Men are, of course, stars of Sony&#x27;s upcoming animated movie sequel (out next month) - which this latest Fortnite crossover is designed to promote.

                              <span>Nintendo fans, get your maracas at the ready. The classic rhythm-action game Samba de Amigo will be sashaying its way onto the Switch on 29th August. 


This Switch version of the game is known as Samba de Amigo: Party Central. It sees players shaking their joy-con remotes around as though they are maracas, while simultaneously following on-screen prompts to pose and dance their way through a collection of infectious tunes. 


It also adds in a range of new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress, so you will be quite literally kept on your toes.

                              <span>Square Enix has released a new patch for fantasy adventure Forspoken, ahead of the release of its In Tanta We Trust DLC on Friday.


One feature is an adjustment to the frequency and &quot;content&quot; of the &quot;banter&quot; between Frey and Cuff during open world activities. The game already has an option to amend the amount of Cuff chatter, but as players criticised the game&#x27;s dialogue, it seems Square Enix has continued to make tweaks.


Another interesting change is to the Tanta&#x27;s Familiars: cat creatures Frey can find on her journey and who inhabit the game&#x27;s rest spots. Now they will follow Frey around to collect mana and items - I&#x27;m picturing Frey accompanied by an army of cute cats, which sounds adorable.

The audio pack has been out for some time, but the latest update is a major overhaul that improves the sound quality, has smoother sound transitions, and makes environmental sounds clearer for an improved ambient experience.


The pack is available at extra cost, but has a 30 percent discount until 21st June to celebrate the launch of Patch 6.4. For more information and to purchase the pack, visit the official website. It&#x27;s priced at £15 (£11 with the discount) and there&#x27;s a 30 day free trial available.

                              <span>Blizzard&#x27;s chief design officer Allen Adham has reportedly told staff to &quot;prepare to be amazed&quot; by the company&#x27;s AI technology. 


An email seen by the New York Times  regarding &#x27;Blizzard Diffusion&#x27; was sent to employees earlier this year. Blizzard Diffusion is the company&#x27;s internal AI tool, which has allegedly been trained as an image generator on Blizzard&#x27;s own titles (its name is a play on Stable Diffusion, another AI image generation platform). 


Reportedly, this tool was being used &quot;to help generate concept art for game environments as well as characters and their outfits&quot;. Adham also made mention of possible tools for &quot;autonomous, intelligent, in-game NPCs,&quot; &quot;procedurally assisted level design&quot; and AI-assisted &quot;voice cloning,&quot; &quot;game coding&quot; and &quot;anti-toxicity&quot; in his email.

                              <span>Mario Kart Tour maker Nintendo is facing a lawsuit over the smartphone app&#x27;s now-removed randomised reward mechanic, lodged by a boy who racked up $170 (£137) in-game using his father&#x27;s credit card.


The class action suit was lodged this month by an unidentified minor - albeit via his legal guardian (thanks, Axios). The suit claims that Nintendo&#x27;s gacha-style rewards system in Mario Kart Tour violated consumer protection and business profession laws.


Specifically, the boy is seeking compensation for Mario Kart Tour&#x27;s Spotlight Pipes, which let you pay real-world money for in-game Ruby currency, and spend them on chances for randomised rewards.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has discussed the possibility of dropping numbers from future games in the series.


Each game in the Final Fantasy series is individual - only a couple have had direct sequels - but Yoshida admitted this can be tough for marketing as some players approach the latest game wondering if the story continues from previous games.


&quot;A lot of players are going to come in and they&#x27;re going to look at it like a comic book where you have to read from the beginning to know what&#x27;s going on now,&quot; Yoshida told GQ in an interview.

                              <span>Charmander is arriving in Las Vegas&#x27; neighbourhood, baby, but perhaps not in the way you expect. Rather, this is thanks to a new Nevada housing development and its wholesome approach to street names. 


Located in Henderson, roughly 16 miles southeast of downtown Las Vegas, housing project Serenity Place includes street names inspired by Pokémon. This includes Charmander Lane, Charizard Lane, Jigglypuff Place, Snorlax Lane and Squirtle Lane. Yes, really.


Naming streets in the Vegas neighbourhood isn&#x27;t an easy job, project construction manager Andrea Miller told local news station KLAS 8 News Now (via Polygon). However, Miller was inspired to use the above names as her sons are &quot;obsessed&quot; with Pokémon.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom voice actress Patricia Summersett has issued a statement meant to &quot;clarify&quot; her previous comments on Link and Zelda being &quot;in a relationship&quot;.


Summersett previously discussed the dynamic between Link and Zelda in an interview with The Gamer, in which she stated: &quot;I know that they are in a relationship with each other, it&#x27;s active, there&#x27;s a lot of care and a lot of listening, and I just love that about it.&quot;


The quote was notable for going further than Nintendo itself has officially gone in defining the bond between The Legend of Zelda&#x27;s two main characters, and while it was simply Summersett&#x27;s own opinion, as voice actress for the series&#x27; namesake, it was pounced upon by fans.

                              <span>Amid records losses and a raft of cancelled games, Ubisoft is reportedly aiming to release Massive Entertainment&#x27;s long-awaited open-world Star Wars game in &quot;early 2024&quot;.


Announced back in 2021, little is known about The Division developer Massive Entertainment&#x27;s open-world Star Wars game, beyond the fact it&#x27;s being helmed by The Division 2 director Julian Gerighty and will utilise the studio&#x27;s Snowdrop engine.


With so little information currently out in the wild, many had assumed Massive&#x27;s Star Wars project was still some considerable way off, but Kotaku is now reporting the title is, in fact, the mysterious &quot;another large game&quot; Ubisoft has previously confirmed to be launching during its 2023-24 fiscal year, with the publisher said to be targeting an &quot;early 2024&quot; launch.

                              <span>Insomniac has dismissed growing reports its upcoming Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will feature co-op, confirming it&#x27;s an &quot;epic single-player adventure&quot;.


Some publications began reporting potential co-op support in Spider-Man 2 earlier this week after fans unearthed comments made by Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter last September. When asked if Spider-Man 2 would feature co-op during a SacAnime Summer 2022 Q&amp;A, Jeter replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been announced or not, but I think so.&quot;


Co-op speculation has followed Spider-Man 2 ever since Insomniac announced Peter Parker and Miles Morales would both play a prominent role in the sequel, but the studio has now shot down co-op chatter once and for all. After a fan tweeted to ask if co-op was on the cards, it replied wrote, &quot;Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!&quot;.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest is almost upon us, kicking off with a live showcase before splintering into a &quot;season&quot; of disparate publisher events in the absence of E3. But first that showcase, which is now confirmed to be two hours in length, and featuring at least a couple of &quot;pretty big&quot; things.


Summer Game Fest gets underway on 8th June, with a live show consisting of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements. That&#x27;s pretty much as far as details went in previous teases, but now, in an interview on the Epic Games Store, show host and producer Geoff Keighley has now shared a little more about what to expect from the format.


Alongside its now confirmed two-hour duration, Keighley suggests Summer Game Fest live will be a little more laidback compared to the bombastic Game Awards, offering a &quot;chance to talk to the developers and showcase games and give a little bit more context around games&quot;. While the exact line-up still appears to be in flux, Keighley does say he expects the Summer Game Fest live show to feature three or four things that are &quot;pretty big for this audience.&quot;

                              <span>Lars Gustavsson, former creative director on DICE&#x27;s long-running Battlefield series, has unveiled his new studio TTK Games, which is currently developing an online shooter.


Gustavsson departed DICE last September after more than 20 years at the studio, having - as EA wrote in its announcement - &quot;decided he is ready for a new adventure&quot;. Gustavsson offered no suggestion of what that new adventure might be at the time, but all has now been revealed.


Gustavsson&#x27;s new studio, the Stockholm-based TTK Games, has been co-founded by four former members of DICE; Gustavsson will serve as CEO and creative director, while Daniel Berlin (previously lead world designer and design director on Battlefield) is senior design director. They&#x27;re joined by chief technical officer and technical director Vidar Nygren (technical director on Battlefield), plus art director Peter Hoyles, who served as studio art director at DICE LA.

                              <span>Yuke&#x27;s, the renowned Japanese developer responsible for nearly two decades of popular WWE games, marks its return to the wrestling genre next month, when AEW: Fight Forever launches fo Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 29th June.


Yuke&#x27;s has been associated wrestling ever since its inception in 1995, and the studio&#x27;s long association with WWE began in 2000, with the launch of WWF SmackDown. It continued to work on the WWE licence until 2018&#x27;s WWE 2K19, when publisher 2K decided to hand the reins exclusively to the US-based Visual Concepts, which had co-developed the series with Yuke&#x27;s since 2013. Unfortunately, Visual Concepts&#x27; solo debut proved so disastrous 2K made the unprecedented move of skipping the long-running series&#x27; annual release for two years in a row, only bringing it back in 2022.


So with WWE 2K temporarily out of commision, wrestling fans were quite intrigued when, in 2020, it was announced Yuke&#x27;s would be returning to the genre with a game for WWE rival AEW, under the watch of publisher THQ Nordic. And we&#x27;ll finally get a chance to see what the developer&#x27;s been up when AEW: Fight Forever launches this June.

                              <span>Lego&#x27;s previously rumoured Pac-Man arcade machine model is the real deal. 


Set to launch on 1st June for Lego VIP members, or 4th June for the rest of us, this new model will cost you a pretty penny. Its recommended retail price is £229.99, or $269.99 / €269.99 for those outside the UK. 


The set is a collaboration between Bandai Namco and the Lego Group, released to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of Pac-Man. It features the upper half of a Pac-Man cabinet. Along with the cabinet half itself, which is interactive, there are also Lego models of Pac-Man and two of its ghosts - Blinky and Clyde, to be precise.

                              <span>There&#x27;s plenty of iconic music in the Final Fantasy series, but perhaps no jingle is as memorable as the battle fanfare.


Its style - instrumentation, arrangement - differs across the series, reflecting the world and characters of each game.


In Final Fantasy 16, the battle fanfare has (for the first time outside Final Fantasy 14) lyrics and is sung by a choir. Not only are those lyrics in Ancient Greek, they&#x27;re a major plot spoiler for the game.

Matthew Porretta, who also plays Control&#x27;s Dr. Casper Darling, appeared on YouTube podcast Monsters, Madness, and Magic over the weekend. There, he casually revealed Alan Wake 2 is &quot;supposed to come out in October&quot;.


&quot;I&#x27;ve been working on it,&quot; Porretta said, when the topic turned to Remedy&#x27;s nightmarish &#x27;my manuscript has come to life and everything is trying to kill me&#x27; thriller sequel. &quot;That&#x27;s supposed to come out in October. We&#x27;re in the middle of working on it now.&quot;

                              <span>PlayStation head Jim Ryan believes Sony&#x27;s current strategy of releasing games on PC several years after their console launch is working well, and fans find the extra wait for a PC port &quot;acceptable&quot;.


Chatting to Famitsu (via IGN), Ryan said Sony understood &quot;the importance of PS5 exclusive titles&quot; such as last year&#x27;s God of War Ragnarök, and as such dismissed the idea of launching games on PC at the same time as their console counterparts. &quot;PlayStation Studios&#x27; main responsibility is to make games for the latest PlayStation hardware that players will enjoy,&quot; Ryan explained. He went on to state the company is increasing its PS5 exclusives and &quot;staggering the release of the PC versions&quot;. 


This comment from Ryan echoes those of PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, who previously stated that the company&#x27;s first-party releases will likely take &quot;at least a year&quot; to launch on PC, with the possible exception of live-service games.

This is by no means the first duplication glitch found in the game - and Nintendo is yet to patch them out.


This new glitch, shared on reddit, allowed the poster to get 20 diamonds in under 30 seconds, so it&#x27;s real game-breaking stuff.

Speaking in his latest YouTube video on game development, Sakurai discussed the addition of online play to the series in Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii. In it, he lined out why he believed the series was better suited for local competition - for both philosophical and technical reasons.


Indeed, Sakurai addressed Nintendo&#x27;s often shaky online servers, saying that &quot;network lag tends to make the game a pretty choppy experience&quot;. Ultimately, though, it sounds like adding online play was something he had to do: &quot;when it comes to technical issues, it doesn&#x27;t really matter what I personally think,&quot; he said. &quot;If my job is to do it, I&#x27;ll do it.&quot;

The most recent numbered game in the series was Mortal Kombat 11, so some fans are confused by the return to Mortal Kombat 1.


While this new game is a reboot of the series, it&#x27;s not a remake of the 1992 original.

                              <span>Google has backtracked on its plan to delete inactive YouTube videos—at least for now. Of course, it could change its mind anytime it wants.
It would be nice if this would get people to think about the vulnerabilities inherent in letting a for-profit monopoly decide what of human creativity is worth saving.</span>

That&#x27;s right. Despite there being no formal or programmed way to physically pet Link&#x27;s canine companion, players have developed strange and wonderful ways to do it anyway.

Take QuillerKween. Taking &quot;you cannot pet the dog in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&quot; as a threat, they set out to show us that you can. Well. Kinda.

The Merciless Monstrosity event will roll out next months, June 2023, and ushers in new quests, cosmetics, and a completely new zone and class, too.

&quot;The creation of Sanctuary by Inarius and Lilith is a storied tale; its impact can still be felt today,&quot; Blizzard teases. &quot;The Merciless Monstrosity event, Children of Lilith Battle Pass, and Hatred’s Heritage Phantom Market will be experienceable expressions of Sanctuary’s matriarch. Your opportunity to let sin flow freely will arrive in early June.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;ve just noticed something cool,&quot; McDonald said, referencing images uploaded to Bloodborne&#x27;s Fandom wiki.

The studio has also confirmed that the game will now also be coming to current-gen consoles – so not PS4 or Xbox One – and feature reworked co-op.

&quot;System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition was created with the goal of reverse engineering the original code to port SS2 to the KEX Engine and made available on next-generation consoles for the first time,&quot; explains the video&#x27;s description.

The comments came during a recent Take-Two earnings call, in which Zelnick was asked how AI could impact Take-Two&#x27;s game development.

&quot;As you know I&#x27;m usually a sceptic when others engage in hyperbole, [but] in the case of AI I&#x27;m pretty enthusiastic,&quot; Zelnick told investors (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Elden Ring has won the Nebula Award for Best Game Writing.

Elden Ring beat off competition from Pentiment, Journeys through the Radiant Citadel, Stray, Vampire: The Masquerade – Sins of the Sires, and Horizon Forbidden West to secure the highly regarded accolade.

The Nebulas are awarded by the Science Fictions &amp; Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) to celebrate the genre&#x27;s best writing across a range of media, including short stories, novels, movies, video games, although the latter category was only introduced in 2018.

                              <span>Brace yourself, Spartans – Infection mode is finally coming to Halo Infinite.

&quot;Infection returns in Season 4,&quot; 343 Industries announced via a simple tweet posted to the official Halo social media channels. &quot;The fight to survive starts on June 20.&quot;

Infection – a zombie PvP mode that sees infected Spartans seek out and infect their healthy comrades – has long been a Spartan staple but was notably missing from Infinite when it launched back in 2021.

                              <span>A studio has posted a warning to fellow indie developers after it was unable to claim its own username on Discord. 

In a Twitter thread, indie team Rusty Lake detailed the trouble it has experienced securing its own username for its 240K+ member Discord community. 

Discord announced plans to change its usernames earlier this month. At present, usernames are case sensitive and have a four-digit identifier, called a discriminator, appended to create a unique username, but the new changes remove the need for the discriminator, meaning you don&#x27;t have to remember the random number combination when trying to add friends.

With plans to &quot;pull out all the stops - gameplay mechanics, visual tricks, and audio scares&quot;, director Tymon Smektała says the new &quot;tense experience&quot; will ensure that horror remains a big part of Dying Light&#x27;s DNA &quot;moving forward&quot;.

&quot;Horror became a huge part of Dying Light’s DNA so we’ll keep it as a part of the experience moving forward,&quot; Smektała told TheGamer.

In a tweet, Yamauchi confirmed that the update would drop &quot;next week&quot; and shared the now customary shadowy screenshot of the new arrivals. 

Whilst the vehicles won&#x27;t be confirmed until next week, it looks as though the new line-up includes the Nissan Skyline (R32) GT-R Nismo and a couple of retro cars – a 1960s Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GT and the Greening Auto Company 1971 Ford Maverick (thanks, Traxion.gg).

                              <span>The Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund a new rogue-lite board game inspired by Dead Cells hit its target within 13 minutes, raising almost £400,000 more than its £29,764 target.

The board game - which can be played solo or with up to four players - was first unveiled back in March, and has been backed by over 5500 people. 

&quot;We can tell that the designers had played Dead Cells and that they weren&#x27;t interested in simply doing a carbon copy,&quot; The Motion Twin team and Arthur Décamp, Dead Cells Game Director says of the project. &quot;They had thought deeply about how to best adapt Dead Cells into board game format. The overarching principles of the game have been preserved (the energy, the visceral nature of combats, and the build options) without altering the experience expected for a modern board game.

                              <span>Pokémon has apologised for putting &quot;the cart before the Mudsdale&quot; and walked back an announcement that had confirmed Pokémon Home version 3.0.0. – which connect the latest Pokémon games to the service – would be available from 24th May 2023.

Earlier this week, we reported that the latest Pokémon games for Nintendo Switch will finally connect to cloud service Pokémon Home following an update due next Wednesday, 24th May. Now, however, the official Pokémon website says that &quot;the actual release date is yet to be announced&quot;. 

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet first arrived in November last year, and until now have been unable to connect to Pokémon Home, the service which lets you transfer creatures to and from other Pokémon games.

                              <span>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now Japan&#x27;s seventh biggest game launch of all time.

According to Game Data Library – self-described as &quot;the largest collection of Japanese games sales on the internet&quot; – it has surpassed the launches of huge games across all platforms, including Final Fantasy 7, Pokémon Sun/Moon, and Monster Hunter: World. 

Only Pokémon Scarlet/Violet – which holds the top spot – Splatoon 3, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokémon Black/White, Final Fantasy 8, and Dragon Quest 9 have shifted more copies in Japan at launch (thanks, mynintendonews).

                              <span>Crypt of the NecroDancer studio Brace Yourself Games has confirmed it has laid off half its staff.

As spotted by Game Developer, senior producer Crystal Savin posted a notice to Twitter stating that the workforce had been cut by &quot;50 per cent&quot;. Studio founder Ryan Clare and director of communications Madeline Gray later retweeted Savin&#x27;s tweet, essentially confirming the layoffs.

&quot;Yesterday, senior management at Brace Yourself Games made the incredibly difficult decision to lay off a portion of the company’s staff,&quot; Brace Yourself Games told PC Gamer. &quot;This decision was not made lightly, as we deeply value our talented and dedicated employees.

                              <span>The Wonderful 101: Remastered&#x27;s After School Hero DLC - which was promised as a Kickstarter stretch goal back in 2020 - has now arrived, and it&#x27;s free to download on PlayStation and PC.


After School Hero was one of several stretch goals detailed when developer PlatinumGames opted to take a remastered version of Wii U cult classic The Wonderful 101 to Kickstarter back on 2020, and promised a side-scrolling adventure focused on a &quot;young hero&quot; named Luka.


The Wonderful 101: Remastered&#x27;s other DLC stretch goal, a Time Attack mode, launched back in 2021, so it&#x27;s been a bit of a wait for the DLC originally referred to as &quot;Luka&#x27;s First Mission&quot;.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 is finally official after several weeks of teases, but a few mysteries still remain. And it looks like Amazon might have inadvertently solved one of those ahead of schedule by leaking the characters included in the game&#x27;s Kombat Pack DLC.


Mortal Kombat 1 - which, as rumoured, will be a reboot of sorts, taking place in a &quot;reborn&quot; universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang - is set to release on 19th September, and it&#x27;ll be accompanied by a Kombat Pack providing early access to six additional playable characters and five assist characters known as Kameo Fighters.


At the time of Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s announcement, publisher Warner Bros. confirmed the Kombat Pack would be included in Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s Premium and Kollector&#x27;s Editions, but neglected to tell prospective purchasers what additional characters they&#x27;d get in return for their money.

                              <span>If your ears, like mine, find Sonic CD&#x27;s Sonic Boom or Sonic the Hedgehog 3&#x27;s Ice Cap Zone Act 1 theme to be like soothing lullabies whispered from a distant past, then you might be interested in the Sonic Symphony World Tour, which is turning some of the series&#x27; best-loved tunes into a live concert starting at London&#x27;s Barbican in September.


Described as an &quot;immersive live experience that celebrates more than three decades of music from Sega&#x27;s iconic mascot&quot;, Sonic Symphony promises a &quot;musical tour&quot; through the series&#x27; history. It&#x27;ll feature &quot;classic 8-bit and 16-bit tunes to rock and EDM songs&quot;, all played by a full symphony orchestra and rock band - and accompanied by on-screen Sonic footage for the benefit of those requiring eye stimulation along with the amusement to their ears.


Sega and show organiser MGP Live have announced two dates for the Sonic Symphony World Tour so far, beginning with a performance at London&#x27;s Barbican Hall on 16th September this year. After that, it&#x27;ll depart the UK and head over to the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, for a second show on 30th September.

Many publishers have adopted this $70 price point as standard, including the likes of Sony, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Earlier this week, Sega also suggested it could adopt a similar approach for its future releases, and stated it was &quot;keeping an eye on market conditions&quot;.


As for those who have already increased prices to this higher point, Zelnick claimed he hasn&#x27;t seen any real resistance from players so far.

During the events of Burning Shores, Aloy meets Seyka, an &quot;ambitious marine of the Quen tribe who has stepped up to help her people survive&quot;. Ahead of the DLC&#x27;s release, Seyka was touted as a character that would be Aloy&#x27;s equal, with actress Ashly Burch even saying &quot;Aloy may have met her match&quot;.

                              <span>Legendary game developer John Carmack has defended his decision to attend a science fiction and fantasy convention for &quot;non-leftist&quot; writers, following social media criticism.


Carmack announced he would attend BasedCon this week via Twitter, prompting displeasure from followers upset at the event&#x27;s description as an alternative to the &quot;publishing industry&#x27;s hostility to authors who are critical of progressive dogma&quot;. 


The event&#x27;s name stems from the internet slang &quot;based&quot;, which BasedCon&#x27;s own About page describes as &quot;the opposite of social justice activism&quot; and identified by &quot;based beliefs&quot; such as &quot;discriminating against white people is racism&quot;, &quot;men cannot give birth&quot;, and also &quot;guns don&#x27;t kill people, people kill people&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard has detailed the accessibility features that have been implemented in the forthcoming Diablo 4.


A new blog post lists the major features relating to dexterity assistance, text assistance, and vision assistance.



Said lead accessibility designer Drew McCrory: &quot;The only limitation to adventuring in Sanctuary should be interest, not capability.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has released the first patch to Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but the game&#x27;s duplication glitches remain.


The patch itself is minimal, fixing &quot;several issues&quot; to &quot;improve the gameplay experience&quot;, as well as an issue with the main quest &#x27;The Closed Door&#x27; that prevented players from completing it (I am not that far, but if you know, you know).


More interesting is that the game&#x27;s item duplication glitches remain intact.

Nintendo has typically left Link and Zelda&#x27;s relationship up to players&#x27; own interpretations, and gives the series&#x27; two main characters only a limited amount of screentime together. 


Now, voice actress Patricia Summersett has discussed her take on the character, after voicing Zelda in Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom and spin-off Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.

                              <span>Nintendo has announced the next batch of Game Boy Advance titles for its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service. 


On 26th May, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will get their hands on Super Mario Advance, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2, and Yoshi&#x27;s Island: Super Mario Advance 3. 


In Super Mario Advance, players are tasked with launching a load of vegetables and other items at their enemies, in order to reign victorious. This is the Game Boy Advance version of Super Mario Bros. 2 - the game that introduced the world to Nintendo&#x27;s pink, bow wearing, anthropomorphic dinosaur, Birdo. Birdo is a bit of a favourite here at Eurogamer, and you can find out more about her in our article dedicated to the Nintendo icon here.

                              <span>Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to Adeline Software&#x27;s much-loved Little Big Adventure series, recently announced it was working on a ground-up &quot;remaster&quot; of both titles, and we&#x27;ve now been given a tiny glimpse of the Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up in action.


The original Little Big Adventure, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, released back in 1994 and delivered a memorable blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock. A sequel then followed three years later.


2.21 first discussed its plans to remaster Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 back in March, explaining it was taking on the projects while it continued discussions with publishers to make its previously announced Little Big Adventure reboot a reality.

When Sonic Prime was announced back in February 2021, Netflix described it as a 24-episode animated series that would send Sonic on a &quot;journey of self-discovery and redemption&quot; in which the &quot;fate of a strange new multiverse&quot; was in his hands.


Sonic Prime&#x27;s initial batch of episodes saw Sonic traversing the Shatterverse - a collection of alternative dimensions formed after Dr. Eggman&#x27;s Paradox Prism was destroyed in battle - in a quest to restore the universe, all with a little help from different versions of his familiar friends.

                              <span>Maquette, the striking &quot;recursive&quot; first-person puzzle adventure from developer Graceful Decay and publisher Annapurna Interactive, is making its way to Switch next week, on 25th May.


Originally released for PlayStation and PC back in 2021, Maquette builds an ingenious series of spatial challenges inspired by the small-scale sculptors&#x27; models that give the game its name.


Maquettes are sculptures crafted before embarking on a full-scale project, and in Graceful Decay&#x27;s puzzler, that&#x27;s reflected in environments that contain smaller versions of themselves. Crucially in Maquette, changes made to one environment affect the other - so if you were to, say, place a cube in a tiny courtyard in front of you, it would then materialise in the full-size courtyard you stand in, giving you a means to progress to the next area - and on it goes.

Details on PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack are slim at present, but a teaser video announcing the crossover does offer a glimpse of a player taking in the sights of an unusually mucky Bikini Bottom, nozzle in hand.


Although PowerWash Simulator has recieved a couple of free crossovers previously - whisking players to Tomb Raider&#x27;s Croft Manor and Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s Midgar - SpongeBob will be the first in a series of paid Special Pack DLC crossovers, which were announced as part of developer FuturLab&#x27;s 2023 content roadmap back in April.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima&#x27;s Death Stranding is the latest free game available to claim via the Epic Game Store. 


The open-world sci-fi delivery simulator, sorry, &quot;Strand&quot; game, typically costs £24, so this is a decent saving. Nab it for yourself via this Epic Game Store link, until 25th May at 4pm UK time.


Before you do that, it&#x27;s worth flagging a few other Epic Game Store bits which have been announced today, including a five percent credit on purchases made through the Store.

&quot;We talk a lot about Game Pass because subscription is the latest option that we scaled: you have pay-to-play, then there was free-to-play, and then we introduced Game Pass,&quot; Sarah Bond, corporate vice president for game creator experience and ecosystem at Xbox, told Rolling Stone UK.

&quot;We&#x27;ve talked about how we&#x27;re experimenting with other models, like what does it mean for advertising in games which is more prevalent in mobile – are there models of that that work well in PC and console? Are there other models where you might have timed slices of games and stuff like that?

                              <span>Activision has shut down a Call of Duty fan-project almost two years in the making. 


SM2, as this project was known, was a Call of Duty client based off the Modern Warfare 2 engine, complete with maps and weapons from across the series. 


However, despite the evident dedication from all involved with SM2, the team has been forced to &quot;[shut] down operations permanently&quot;, after it received a cease and desist letter from Call of Duty publisher, Activision.

                              <span>The latest Pokémon games for Nintendo Switch will finally connect to cloud service Pokémon Home following an update due next Wednesday, 24th May. 


Pokémon Scarlet and Violet first arrived in November last year, and until now have been unable to connect to Pokémon Home, the service which lets you transfer creatures to and from other Pokémon games. 


That all changes next week, when Scarlet and Violet will gain Home compatibility. This means being able to import any supported creature from any of the mainline games supported by Home at present, alongside the previous storage service Pokémon Bank, and also Pokémon Go.

                              <span>Acclaimed puzzle game The Case of the Golden Idol is coming to Nintendo Switch. After a period of PC exclusivity, the murder mystery head scratcher will be making its console debut next Thursday 25th May. 


On its release, Switch players will be able to experience all of the game&#x27;s redacted and perplexing scenarios in a whole new way, thanks to touchscreen controls. For those who don&#x27;t want to get their screens all mucky, however, there is also a custom developed controller layout option for gathering up evidence. This Switch release also boasts an overhauled UI, for the &quot;best user experience&quot; when playing the game in either docked or handheld mode. 


As well as the base game, Switch owners will also have the opportunity to get their hands on Golden Idol&#x27;s first expansion - The Spider of Lanka. This DLC kicks off a year before The Case of the Golden Idol&#x27;s first scenario, and follows the story of Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller as they make their maiden voyage to the Kingdom of Lanka.

The update was revealed in a blog post by developer Iron Galaxy yesterday, along with information on what players can expect as the migration takes place.
&quot;It has become more challenging to deal with issues that crop up due to [Killer Instinct]&#x27;s reliance on legacy services,&quot; the developer said.

As expected, Mortal Kombat 1 is a reboot of sorts (developer NetherRealm has rebooted Mortal Kombat a number of times over the years), set in a &quot;reborn&quot; universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang who ended up victorious at the end of Mortal Kombat 11.


Mortal Kombat 1 has a brand new story featuring familiar characters, NetherRealm said. The debut trailer is below (be warned, things get very gory):

                              <span>Nvidia has officially unveiled its first mid-range Ada Lovelace graphics card, the RTX 4060 Ti, with both 8GB and 16GB variants at $399/£389 and $499 respectively. The 8GB card is the first to be released, with sales beginning on May 24th, while the 16GB variant debuts in July. The firm also detailed its mainstream RTX 4060 GPU, also coming in July, to debut at $299. 
All three models ought to offer a reasonable boost in performance over their predecessors, while also adding DLSS 3 frame generation - which is perhaps more impactful on mid-range hardware than it is on the likes of the RTX 4090 which is powerful enough without it. That should allow the 4060 family to be a reasonable choice for gaming at 1080p with maxed settings (including RT / DLSS), or at 1440p with some settings reductions. 
On average, Nvidia is claiming the 4060 Ti is 1.15x faster than the 3060 Ti and 1.6x faster than the 2060 Super (1.7x and 2.6x faster with DLSS 3). Similarly, the RTX 4060 is 1.2x faster than RTX 3060 and 1.6x faster than RTX 2060 (1.7x and 2.3x with DLSS 3).

Originally slated for the first half of 2023, early access will now begin this autumn.


&quot;The reason for the release shift is simple: the playtest process is working,&quot; said Flynn in a new developer update video detailing the delay (see below).

But, of course, this isn&#x27;t the only Lord of the Rings MMO out there. Word of Amazon&#x27;s plans inevitably sparked questions around what might happen to the already existing and well-established MMO The Lord of the Rings Online from Middle-earth Enterprises and Standing Stone Games.

Will the two struggle to co-exist? No, says Amazon Games&#x27; vice president Christoph Hartmann.

                              <span>UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt has called upon the country&#x27;s regulator to understand its &quot;wider responsibilities&quot; to promote economic growth, following its recent block of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout.


The remarks, reported by The Telegraph, follow questions from MPs this week directed at bosses of the Competition and Markets Authority regarding the decision which has scuppered Microsoft&#x27;s ambitions here in the UK - and potentially worldwide.


Both Microsoft and Activision have criticised the UK for disrupting the deal, and have labelled the country as being &quot;bad for business&quot; post-Brexit. The remarks come in stark contrast to the vision for the UK&#x27;s tech industry previously set out by Hunt and UK prime minister Rishi Sunak to become the &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; of Europe.

                              <span>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom players have discovered multiple glitches to duplicate items.


One involves fusing an item using the bow, while another allows players to duplicate weapons and shields. Both involve exiting and entering the pause menu at high speed.


Both methods potentially allow for infinite copies of certain items, whether you&#x27;re seeking powerful ammo and weapons, or want to sell items for extra Rupees.

iTunes has listed the film as being able to own from 22nd May here in the UK. 


Currently, iTunes appears to be the only place listing a purchase date for those of us in Blighty. I checked elsewhere and YouTube and Amazon Prime both have the film available to pre-order, but no release date. Netflix just sends you to its Sonic Prime animated series.

Blizzard&#x27;s upcoming action RPG guides the player through its various zones as they make progress on the campaign, and here it should feel like you&#x27;re a little more powerful than the creatures you face.

&quot;We don&#x27;t want a part of the game to ever become utterly trivial, such that there&#x27;s no reason to return to that place,&quot; associate game director Joe Piepiora explained to Eurogamer in an interview.
