                    <span>Mario Party Superstars is poised to delve into the series&#x27; past to deliver some classic board-and-minigame action on Switch later this month, starting 29th October, and Nintendo has offered a closer look at both ahead of its launch.
Drawing on over two decades of releases, Mario Party Superstars features five boards taken from the series&#x27; N64 era - Yoshi&#x27;s Tropical Island, Space Land, Peach&#x27;s Birthday Cake, Woody Woods, and Horror Land - all redesigned for Switch and featuring their own unique events, while its minigames have been selected from all across previous Mario Party instalments.

                    <span>Quake&#x27;s 25th anniversary enhanced edition, which released for PC and consoles back in August, has just received a free &quot;next-gen&quot; upgrade for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
The original enhanced edition - which bundles together Quake, its two official expansions, plus two additional expansions by Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games - was already an extremely solid brush-up of the quarter-century-old FPS classic, but the newly released &quot;next-gen&quot; upgrade adds a little extra oomph for Xbox Series X/S and PS5 owners.

On the face of it, Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo delivers pretty much exactly what you&#x27;d expect from a zoo tycoon, tasking players with importing and breeding animals (from a list of over 500), managing staff, and fashioning an appealing park using scenery items, shops, and amenities in order to keep guests happy and the money rolling in.

                    <span>There&#x27;s some potentially disappointing news for Monster Hunter Rise players; Capcom has revealed that it will be &quot;unable to implement&quot; cross-saves and cross-play between the original Switch version and its upcoming PC port.
Following Capcom&#x27;s recent confirmation that Monster Hunter Rise would launch for PC on 12th January next year, players immediately began questioning how both versions might interact with each other. Some players wondered if they&#x27;d be able to team up with friends playing on a different platform, while others, eager to take advantage of the increased graphical fidelity on PC, asked if Capcom might provide a way to transfer potentially hundreds of hours of time investment from Nintendo&#x27;s console to PC - particularly after an official questionnaire seemed to suggest cross-play and cross-saves were features the publisher was considering.

Riders Republic, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, takes the open-world winter sports action of Steep and expands it out to feature a broader range of activities, encompassing skiing, snowboarding, biking, and wing suits (of the vanilla and jet-powered varieties) in both solo and competitive play - which, in the latter case, includes large-scale competitions for upward of 50 players.

                    <span>&#x27;Tis the season to  be spooky, and Rainbow Six Siege is getting into the spirit of things tomorrow, 12th October, with the return of its Doktor&#x27;s Curse limited-time Halloween event.
Doktor&#x27;s Curse first emerged as a seasonal treat for Rainbow Six Siege players back in Year 4, but its 5v5 hide-and-seek-style Monster Hunt mode - set across a suitably sinister Frankenstein-themed version of the Theme Park map - has, according to Ubisoft, seen a few tweaks for 2021.

                    <span>Microsoft is re-considering its approach to right-to-repair following pressure from shareholders.
As reported by Grist (via VG247), the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow filed a report in June urging Microsoft to analyse the &quot;environmental and social benefits&quot; of making device repair easier, so that consumers can repair their own tech.

                    <span>UK owners of Far Cry 6 on PlayStation 4 are saying they can&#x27;t upgrade their boxed copies to PS5. 
The issue appears to lie in the version of the game they have been sent, as fans in the UK and elsewhere report receiving a Russian version. While this doesn&#x27;t affect the gameplay experience, it does mean the game is incompatible with the UK PS5 upgrade offered to UK PSN account owners.

Even more impressive is the fact this is all just boxed sales - not digital, which Nintendo does not disclose and was not a concern when Prime 3 launched for the Wii. Dread will have sold many more copies via download versions not counted here.

                    <span>It’s not actually banned in the EU yet — the legislative process is much more complicated than that — but it’s a step: a total ban on biometric mass surveillance.
To respect “privacy and human dignity,” MEPs said that EU lawmakers should pass a permanent ban on the automated recognition of individuals in public spaces, saying citizens should only be monitored when suspected of a crime.
The parliament has also called for a ban on the use of private facial recognition databases — such as the controversial AI system created by U.S. startup Clearview...</span>

The Cluster API community is happy to announce the implementation of ClusterClass and Managed Topologies, a new feature that will greatly simplify how you can provision, upgrade, and operate multiple Kubernetes clusters in a declarative way.
A little bit of context…
Before getting into the details, let&#x27;s take a step back and look at the history of Cluster API.
The Cluster API project started three years ago, and the first releases focused on extensibility and implementing a declarative API that allows a seamless experience across infrastructure providers. This was a success with many cloud providers: AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, GCP, Metal3, vSphere and still counting.
With extensibility addressed, the focus shifted to features, like automatic control plane …</span>

                    <span>Following this week&#x27;s massive Twitch data breach - in which everything from site source code to streamer payouts were apparently leaked - a new report has accused the company of fostering a culture that values &quot;speed and profit over the safety of its users and security of its data.&quot;
That&#x27;s the claim made by The Verge, whose sources suggest this week&#x27;s data breach &quot;seemed inevitable&quot; based on their time working at Twitch, alleging a company culture &quot;where employees were very concerned about safety but management less so.&quot;

                    <span>California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing has filed an objection to a recent settlement between Activision Blizzard and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming it would cause &quot;irreparable harm&quot; to its ongoing legal proceedings.
The settlement, announced in September, saw Activision Blizzard agreeing to set aside $18m USD for affected employees after an EEOC investigation stemming back to 2018 found staff at the video game publisher had been sexually harassed, discriminated against for becoming pregnant, and had suffered retaliation by the company after complaining about the behaviour.

Starting in autumn, Grand Theft Auto Online will introduce a &quot;cavalcade&quot; of special in-game gear to celebrate GTA 3&#x27;s 20th anniversary - including commemorative clothing and liveries - all set to be made available as part of a series of still-to-be-announced events.

                    <span>Rockstar has finally made its much-rumoured, occasionally leaked Grand Theft Auto Trilogy remaster official and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch later this year.
Word of an updated trilogy release - focussing on remasters of Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas - first surfaced over the summer, but its existence became considerably more tangible after a Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy listing was spotted on the South Korea&#x27;s game rating board website at the end of September.

That&#x27;s a &quot;sold-in&quot; figure - not &quot;sold-through&quot; to customers. But it&#x27;s an impressive milestone for Capcom&#x27;s 2017 horror title, which is credited with rejuvenating the long-running series.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve known for a while that One Punch Man director Chikara Sakurai and producer Yu Suzuki were working together to bring us a Shenmue anime, and now we&#x27;ve got our first look at the Cruncyroll/Adult Swim production in action - and it looks pretty decent!
With an understandable focus on the action of the series rather than its more ponderous moments where star Ryo Hazuki feeds a kitten or goes for a long walk at night across town so he can play Hang-On, it&#x27;s a high energy look at the world of Shenmue as established in the first three games. Indeed, there are several memorable moments such as Ryo&#x27;s encounter with Lan Di as well as his arrival in Hong Kong, as seen at the start of Shenmue 2.

                    <span>We&#x27;re just a few months away from the first batch of Steam Decks shipping, and, in the run-up to release, Valve has ripped open its handheld gaming PC to give those curious sorts in the audience a quick peek at its decidedly compact innards.
&quot;One of the most frequently asked questions we&#x27;ve received about Steam Deck,&quot; Valve&#x27;s explains over on Steam, &quot;is about the components inside it, and whether they&#x27;re replaceable or upgradable. The answer is a bit more complicated than just a yes or no, so we&#x27;ve made a video to explain all the details.&quot;

                    <span>Have you ever loved something so much you wanted to put your feet in it? If you answered yes and the something you love is Xbox, then there&#x27;s good news: Microsoft has teamed up with Adidas to launch a range of official Xbox shoes.
The foot-focussed collaboration, part of Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing celebrations to mark 20 years since the launch of the original Xbox, begins with the arrival of the Xbox 20th Forum Tech - a pair of trainers sporting &quot;translucent green details&quot; said to be inspired by the Halo: Combat Evolved special edition Xbox, released back in 2001.

                    <span>Sony may have given the PlayStation 3 and Vita stores a last minute reprieve earlier this year following a consumer backlash, but its plans to rein in its legacy services continue, with the company now announcing it&#x27;ll soon be removing the option to pay for items using credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal on its older consoles.
Writing on its Discontinued PlayStation apps, features and services page, Sony says customers will no longer be able to use the aforementioned payment options to either purchase digital content or to add funds to their wallets directly from their PS3 or Vita starting on 27th October.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been just under 11 months since Obsidian launched inch-high garden survival adventure Grounded into early access for Xbox and PC, and as its one-year anniversary approaches, the team is readying Hot and Hazy, its &quot;largest update yet&quot;, for a 20th October release.
Since Grounded&#x27;s stellar launch last year - it attracted a million players within two days and 5 million within four months - the team, still relatively small at only 20 people, has continued to expand on its appealingly diminutive premise.

We don’t have specifics as to edge case pricing dimensions, but Cloudflare’s blog post goes into some detail about how it works. First, it charges a rate […]

A company that is a critical part of the global telecommunications infrastructure used by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and several others around the world such as Vodafone and China Mobile, quietly disclosed that hackers were inside its systems for years, impacting more than 200 of its clients and potentially millions of cellphone users worldwide.

I’ve never heard of the company.
No details about the hack. It could be nothing. It could be a national intelligence service looking for information.</span>

…at approximately 11:39 a.m. ET today (15:39 UTC), someone at Facebook caused an update to be made to the company’s Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) records. BGP is a mechanism by which Internet service providers of the world share information about which providers are responsible for routing Internet traffic to which specific groups of Internet addresses.
In simpler terms, sometime this morning Facebook took away the map telling the world’s computers how to find its various online properties. As a result, when one types Facebook.com into a web browser, the browser has no idea where to find Facebook.com, and so returns an error page...</span>

                    <span>Netflix has a new series called Squid Game, about people competing in a deadly game for money. It has nothing to do with actual squid.
As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>The Wall Street Journal is reporting on a baby’s death at an Alabama hospital in 2019, which they argue was a direct result of the ransomware attack the hospital was undergoing.
Amid the hack, fewer eyes were on the heart monitors — normally tracked on a large screen at the nurses’ station, in addition to inside the delivery room. Attending obstetrician Katelyn Parnell texted the nurse manager that she would have delivered the baby by caesarean section had she seen the monitor readout. “I need u to help me understand why I was not notified.” In another text, Dr. Parnell wrote: “This was preventable.”...</span>

Why Duplicate Data?
It’s convenient to create a copy of your application with a copy of its state for each team.
For example, you might want a separate database copy to test some significant schema changes
or develop other disruptive operations like bulk insert/delete/update...
Duplicating data takes a lot of time. That’s because you need first to download
all the data from a source block storage provider to compute and then send
it back to a storage provider again. There’s a lot of network traffic and CPU/RAM used in this process.
Hardware acceleration by offloading certain expensive operations to dedicated hardware is
always a huge performance boost. It reduces the time required to complete an operation by orders
of magnitude.

                    <span>Everyone says that the next million cloud customers are coming from enterprise IT. It’s the narrative that all of the major cloud platforms have been saying for a while — to the point that I started accepting it uncritically. I even recently wrote about those next million enterprise IT customers. Oof. No! That’s not how […]

Introduction
In Kubernetes, a Node is a representation of a single machine in your cluster. SIG Node owns that very important Node component and supports various subprojects such as Kubelet, Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and more to support how the pods and host resources interact. In this blog, we have summarized our conversation with Elana Hashman (EH) &amp; Sergey Kanzhelev (SK), who walk us through the various aspects of being a part of the SIG and share some insights about how others can get involved.
A summary of our conversation
Could you tell us a little about what SIG Node does?

I vividly remember spending nights restoring crashed servers […]
