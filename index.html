                              <span>Rockstar has released the first GTA 6 trailer early, after it leaked online this evening. The video confirms that GTA will launch in 2025, and shows off the game&#x27;s main characters - a Bonnie and Clyde-style couple who enter into a life of crime.


The 90-second clip had been due to launch tomorrow, but made its way onto the internet earlier than planned. It follows another GTA 6 video leak over the weekend. 


&quot;Our trailer has leaked so please watch the real thing on YouTube,&quot; Rockstar wrote this evening in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Watch the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 below.

                              <span>BioWare just released a new Dragon Age: Dreadwolf teaser, only to then say the game won&#x27;t be getting a full reveal until next year.


The short teaser comes in at just shy of 50 seconds, and pans across some nice vistas - the port city in Antiva sits bathed in evening light, the Rivain shoreline is lapped by azure blue seas, Anderfels is in the midst of a storm. It is all very Dragon Age-y, much as you would expect.


&quot;Enter Thedas, a vibrant land of rugged wilderness, treacherous labyrinths, and glittering cities - steeped in savage combat and secret magics. Now, its fate teeters on a knife&#x27;s edge,&quot; the teaser&#x27;s description reads.

The images included both concept art for the character and an early 3D model. However they are no longer available to view.

The Tears of the Kingdom director noted that with the introduction of caves and underground areas, as well as sky-based action, the studio needed to consider which enemies would be able to &quot;do well&quot; in each area of Hyrule&#x27;s expanded map.

                              <span>Jet Force Gemini on Switch has a broken widescreen mode.


The N64 cult classic is set to hit Nintendo Switch Online for Expansion Pack subscribers in December, but is already available in Japan.



The game supports both 4:3 and 16:9 modes. However, the widescreen mode does not properly scale and instead stretches the image with letterboxing, as reported by Nintendo World Report.

                              <span>NetherRealm has released a new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1, offering up some sorcery-infused Quan Chi gameplay and a release date for his arrival in the game. As well as that, this trailer also shows Khameleon in all her lethal glory, and gives us our best look yet at John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker in-game.


Quan Chi will be arriving in Mortal Kombat 1 later this month. The sorcerer is one of the characters from Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s Kombat Pack. If players have this DLC or the Premium edition of the game, they will be able to put him through his paces from 14th December. 


Alternatively, Quan Chi will be available to download separately from 21st December.

This is the second round of layoffs for the studio this year.


&quot;After a rigorous review we made the decision to change the structure of our support teams, and we have made the tough decision to reduce our workforce by a total of 34 people, across our publishing, HR, IT, and shared services teams,&quot; a studio representative told GamesIndusty.biz.

From the creators of Westworld, executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, and starring Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Chris Parnell, Lost&#x27;s Michael Emerson, and Walton Goggins, Fallout is set to arrive on Prime Video on 12th April 12, 2024. And the teaser has got a lot of us very excited, not least because Dogmeat is now all but confirmed.

And the pilot of the plane I flew. And thousands of other people at the airport and on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply chain—any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning...</span>

                              <span>Electronic Arts has filed a trademark application for the words Neon Fox.

Filed just Friday, 1st December, the trademark application has been filed in numerous categories, including one for computer game software and online entertainment – which means some think this may be a new game – and another in the category &quot;video game development services&quot;, which has others opining that it may be the name of a brand-new studio.

&quot;Personally, I think it&#x27;s a new studio,&quot; said professional leaker and rumourist, Kurakasis. &quot;EA studio trademarks are filed with IC 042: Design and development of interactive, computer, video... unlike games. I think it&#x27;s going to be announced pretty soon.

                              <span>Wondering how Peter Griffin got in shape for Fortnite? Well, wonder no more. 

Epic has drawn back the covers on what&#x27;s next for Fortnite and, as previously leaked, Peter Griffin from Family Guy and Solid Snake are part of the Chapter 5 Season 1: Underground battle pass. 
But while Griffin&#x27;s appearance in Fortnite may not be all that surprising to some who&#x27;ve been paying attention, his actual appearance is.

                              <span>PlayStation has begun emailing players to inform them that due to &quot;content licensing arrangements&quot;, from 31st December, some Dicovery content will be removed from players&#x27; libraries – even if they&#x27;ve paid for it.

The statement, which says the change affects only Discovery content for now, doesn&#x27;t explain why content is being removed, nor apologises for it. All it does is thank players for their &quot;continued support&quot;.

&quot;As of 31 December 2023, due to our content licensing arrangements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library,&quot; the brief statement explains.

The ability to ride trains, wield riot shields, mod weapons, scramble across buildings and grapple up structures is shown in the official launch trailer below. 


Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 5 Island clearly features a number of biomes, including one with sunny vinyards, alpine mountains, and ancient ruins.

                              <span>A seven-second TikTok video claiming to be a &quot;first look at GTA 6&quot; has gone viral, and unsubstantiated rumours reckon the leak comes via the son of a Rockstar developer.

It&#x27;s almost impossible to go online these days without being smacked in the face by at least half a dozen purported GTA 6 &quot;leaks&quot;, but this one was more plausible than most, which is probably why it gained traction. Quickly. 

Two videos have been posted by the seemingly throwaway account i_see_in_4k, and both have - in the last couple of hours – shared a few tantalising seconds of what the poster insists is GTA 6.

                              <span>WWE 2K24 has been rated in Brazil, ahead of the sequel being formally announced by publisher 2K.

Its predecessor, WWE 2K23, was officially announced in January 2023, and released swiftly thereafter in March of that same year, leading some pundits to suggest that a similar timescale could apply here, too.

Whilst it&#x27;s unlikely to come as a shock that the sequel was on the way, the rating board has seemingly confirmed the game&#x27;s existence ahead of 2K&#x27;s own marketing schedule.

In a statement, EA reiterated its commitment to inclusivity by making its &quot;easy-to-use photosensitivity analysis tool&quot; available publicly via open source.                            

The tool, known as IRIS, automatically analyses and identifies frames within videos that could potentially impact players who experience photosensitivity.

                              <span>Sony has patented an updated DualSense controller design that will provide players with &quot;predictive AI assistance features&quot;.

This means the controller will light up or even move certain buttons and sticks to provide hints on what players need to do if they find themselves stuck in a game.

As reported by GameRant, the patent – which was filed on 30th November – details a machine learning model that will monitor a player&#x27;s performance and provide predictive assistance should the player be – or about to be – stuck on a particular puzzle.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s original map will return again (again) in 2024, following its impending destruction (again) during tonight&#x27;s The Big Bang live event. 


Epic Games made the announcement this afternoon on social media, after the wild popularity of the current &quot;OG&quot; season which saw the hugely-popular battle royale return to its roots.


&quot;Ngl the OG season far exceeded our expectations,&quot; Epic Games wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;So much so that we&#x27;d like to bring it back… *opens 2024 roadmap doc* In the meantime, see you on the Battle Bus.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s taken five and a half years of asking from the community, but Sea of Thieves&#x27; oft-requested private servers are almost here, with Rare now confirming the feature will arrive as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure&#x27;s third major Season 10 update on Thursday, 7th December.


Private servers will be available under the new banner of Safer Seas mode, which&#x27;ll co-exist alongside the current shared world experience - officially renamed High Seas. Safer Seas enables up to four friends to crew a ship across a private version of the world and access all PvE content - ranging from emergent events to Trading Company quests and narrative-driven Tall Tales - without needing to deal with other crews.


It is, then, pretty much exactly what people have been asking for since Sea of Thieves&#x27; launch back in 2018, albeit with a number of restrictions. Features including Guilds, Hourglass Factions, and live-service events such as Gold &amp; Glory are all unavailable, and Rare is capping Trading Company progression at 40 in Safer Seas, meaning it won&#x27;t be possible to reach Pirate Legend status without returning to High Seas mode. Additionally, gold or reputation for Athena&#x27;s Fortune or their Reaper&#x27;s Bones counterpart won&#x27;t be earnable.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s E3 2018 trailer and you might remember Night City&#x27;s metro system playing a prominent role - which was why its absence as a fully functional transportation service was so notable come the game&#x27;s beleagured release in December 2020. Three years later though, CD Projekt has announced it&#x27;s restoring the long-missing rideable metro system in a surprise 2.1 update arriving next Tuesday, 5th December.


The 2.1 update coincides with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s Ultimate Edition (bundling together the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion) and was detailed in a new developer livestream, beginning with that long-awaited Metro system. &quot;The metro was not in our plans for a long time,&quot; producer Monika Janowska explained during the presentation. &quot;However, over time we&#x27;ve revisited our plan and... decided that it actually could be achievable.&quot;


Night City&#x27;s metro system, officially known as Night City Area Rapid Transit and described as an &quot;immersive way to travel through the world&quot;, consists of five lines spanning 19 stations. It unlocks after Cyberpunk&#x27;s Konpeki Plaza sequence relatively early on and can either be used as fast travel locations (as was the case prior to 2.1) or &quot;as a proper metro ride experience&quot; for those who&#x27;d like to take in the sights in a more leisurely fashion.

                              <span>Microsoft has cheekily riffed on Rockstar&#x27;s big Grand Theft Auto 6 reveal trailer release date announcement by teasing a surprise announcement of its own. 


Just over two years after launch, a fresh reveal for Halo Infinite will apparently arrive on Monday, 4th December at 5pm UK time.


The announcement was made this evening by Microsoft via a post on X, formerly Twitter, made to look like Rockstar&#x27;s GTA 6 trailer post from this afternoon. The accompanying image shows the softly-lit silhouette of a Halo ring (rather than palm trees and seagulls).

                              <span>The first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer has a release date: this Tuesday, 5th December at 2pm UK time. 


Developer Rockstar announced the news this afternoon, and anticipation is clearly high. Despite only sharing this small update five minutes ago at the time of writing, the studio&#x27;s post on X (formerly Twitter) is already awash with some very enthusiastic responses. 


We knew Rockstar would reveal its first GTA 6 trailer at some point in December. Clearly aware fans were eager for any morsel of news about the next game in the studio&#x27;s hugely successful series, the developer announced last month it would be sharing a trailer in December last month.

                              <span>Everywhere, the shared world creation metaverse-y thing from former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies, will hold its first closed alpha test next week.


Closed Alpha 1: Systems Check will begin on Tuesday 5th December at midday UK time and run through until Monday 18th December. You can sign up for a free account now, via the Everywhere website.


Eurogamer got a glimpse at the hugely-ambitious Everywhere earlier this year, when Benzies assured us it was nothing to do with crypto or NFTs (remember those?) and teased the big budget episodic project MindsEye that will be available within it.

A remaster of the PlayStation 1 (and later PSP) game is heavily sought after by fans of the series.


However, the game&#x27;s director Yasumi Matsuno has seemingly squashed any rumours of a revival.

That&#x27;s according to a recent leak, or perhaps a small slip up by Paramount, which listed the upcoming release date as part of a YouTube video description.


As shared by RebsGaming, the first season of Halo is now available in full as a playlist on YouTube (although, it is only available in certain regions). Included in its description were the words: &quot;catch up before the new season streaming Feb 8th.&quot;

It&#x27;s one of seven games available for free this month through Amazon Prime, also including previously unreleased Atari arcade shooter Akka Arrh which received major praise in our Eurogamer review.

The driving survival game was initially set to release this year, but developer Ironwood Studios made the decision to delay its launch in order to prioritise the team&#x27;s health and wellbeing. 

&quot;It&#x27;s so exciting to know that in a few short months, you&#x27;ll all be out on your own adventures in the Olympic Exclusion Zone,&quot; the developer said while annoucing Pacific Drive&#x27;s new release date. &quot;For those of you who have been waiting for this news, we thank you for your patience and sticking with us! Everyone at Ironwood has been working hard to finish the game and it’s been a long road (pun intended) to get here.&quot;

The long-in-the-works real-time strategy follow-up was previously set to launch in February 2024, following a significant delay from the first half of 2023.


Originally announced in August 2019, the space combat threequel looks ambitious. When our Bertie took a look last year he dubbed it as having tremendous scale, and being &quot;a space RTS for the James Webb era&quot;.

Epic Games&#x27; battle royale is then expected to reboot itself with an all-new Island when it returns online, and a fresh battle pass for Chapter 5: Season 1 that features a tiger-human hybrid, Snake and the long-awaited Peter Griffin.

Speaking in Sao Paulo during the CCXP comics and entertainment convention, Xbox head Phil Spencer said the move into the mobile market is an &quot;important part&quot; of the company&#x27;s strategy (thanks, Bloomberg).
&quot;[It&#x27;s] something we are actively working on today not only alone, but talking to other partners who&#x27;d also like to see more choice for how they can monetise on the phone,&quot; Spencer said.

The epilogue is accessible to players prior to the final fight and takes place six months later, as players say their final goodbyes to the party.


Larian boasts that this ending features some of the most complex writing in the game, tying up player choices from a giant tree of permutations.

                              <span>The Mercenary class has been unveiled for Path of Exile 2, and notably, it brings a whole new style of play to the game: shooter gameplay. It doesn&#x27;t mean the game has suddenly gone first-person, but it does mean optional - and fluidly interchangeable - WASD movement is coming to the series for the first time. And that you can now move slightly while attacking. 
The Mercenary revolves around the crossbow weapon they carry, which behaves - depending on the type of crossbow - like either a shotgun, an assault rifle, or a sniper rifle. You can carry two kinds of crossbow at the same time. 
What your crossbow does also depends heavily on the kind of ammo you&#x27;re using. If you&#x27;re using incendiary ammo, for instance, your assault rifle crossbow will spin-up like a mini-gun and be devastating - and fiery - once revved up. Meanwhile, your sniper crossbow with incendiary ammo will behave more like a rocket launcher, exploding on impact. Frost ammo, meanwhile, freezes enemies and also creates varying kinds of frost effects - or ice walls - on the floor depending on which crossbow you use. Oh, and there&#x27;s a grenade-launcher attachment too, because why not? And again, there are varying types of grenade you can fire.

The agent is put under pressure in three ways. First, it receives a email from its “manager” that the company is not doing well and needs better performance in the next quarter. Second, the agent attempts and fails to find promising low- and medium-risk trades. Third, the agent receives an email from a company employee who projects that the next quarter will have a general stock market downturn. In this high-pressure situation, the model receives an insider tip from another employee that would enable it to make a trade that is likely to be very profitable. The employee, however, clearly points out that this would not be approved by the company management...</span>

                              <span>Xbox chief financial officer Tim Stuart has said Microsoft wants to get Game Pass and its first-party titles on &quot;every screen that can play games&quot; - including Switch and PlayStation - in what he calls &quot;a bit of a change of strategy&quot;.


This isn&#x27;t the first time Microsoft has talked about getting Xbox Game Pass on all platforms, of course; Xbox boss Phil Spencer has referenced the strategy on multiple occasions, calling it a &quot;long term goal&quot; for the company back in 2019.


One year on from that comment, however, it seemed as if Spencer had admitted defeat in getting Game Pass on competing consoles, saying, &quot;The other competitive platforms really aren&#x27;t interested in having a full Xbox experience on their hardware. But for us, we want to be where gamers want to be and that&#x27;s the path that we&#x27;re on.&quot;

                              <span>Sons of the Forest is leaving early access. It will be getting its beefier version 1.0 release next year, on 22nd February. 


In addition, developer Endnight Games has announced that Shawn Ashmore - whom you will likely recognise from Remedy&#x27;s Quantum Break and, more recently, Alan Wake 2 - has joined the cast. He will be voicing Timmy.


Timmy, for those unaware, is the son of Eric LeBlanc, protagonist of the first game (which was simply known as The Forest). Endnight Games has said his role in the story will be expanded when version 1.0 goes live next year.

                              <span>Capcom will sell Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 for $70 on PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S when the long-awaited sequel arrives next March.


It marks the first time Capcom will sell the base version of a new game for that higher price point. This year&#x27;s Resident Evil 4 Remake was sold for $10 less (and while a remake, it was substantially different). Street Fighter 6 was also sold at for less, as was dino hunter Exoprimal.


Capcom had been one of the few publishers not to embrace the $70 price point up until now, but the move comes as no surprise.

The total-tea bizare creations are officially licensed by the cuppa creator, and put together by &quot;controller designer extraordinare&quot; POPeART. 


Yorkshire Tea says it spotted the concept, liked it, saw it had social media oomph and some keen prospective purchasers, and decided to give it the green light. And now you can buy it yourself - albeit for £150.

                              <span>Absurd Ventures, the studio established by Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser earlier this year, has revealed its first two projects: a graphic novel and audio drama, both launching in 2024.


When Absurd Ventures was unveiled back in June, its promotional material made it clear Houser and company were aiming to do more than just make games - with the studio saying it was focused on &quot;building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres&quot; spanning the likes of live-action, animation, games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, scripted podcasts, and more.


And true to its word, Absurd Ventures has now unveiled its first two &quot;universes&quot;: American Caper and A better Paradise. While the studio says &quot;additional stories&quot; from both are in development for “a wide range of formats and platforms&quot;, American Caper will debut as a graphic novel and A Better Paradise will begin as an audio drama.

                              <span>Netflix has announced it&#x27;ll be adding Rockstar&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas - in their Definite Edition guises - to its gaming catalogue on 14th December.


The news follows reports earlier this year that Netflix had been in talks with Rockstar to license a GTA game as part of an attempt to introduce &quot;higher-end&quot; titles to its mobile-focused gaming catalogue - which primarily offers a mix of casual games and acclaimed indies at present, including the likes of Dead Cells, Kentucky Route Zero, and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.


At the time, the Wall Street Journal reported Netflix believed a more significant gaming presence would help it attract new subscribers and retain existing ones by giving them something to engage with between seasons of their favourite shows.

Monster Hunter Snow, as I&#x27;m now calling it, will see its in-game world blanketed in a wintry landscape as it launches a new season - Filminations in the Frost - and unleashes a menagerie of new monsters.


Zinogre, Banbaro, Barioth and Radobaan will all be introduced, alongside the smaller Cortos and Wulg. The Monster Hunter Now team has also taken player feedback on board to bring in a couple of much-requested weapons, too: the lance and dual blades.

Tour events typically feature all Pokémon found in a specific region from the main series Pokémon games, and in this case it&#x27;s Diamond and Pearl&#x27;s Sinnoh.

                              <span>The PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup has been revealed for December, ending the year on a high.


Squirt &#x27;em up PowerWash Simulator leads the charge, after launching on Game Pass last year. It lets players powerwash vehicles, houses, parks and more, alone and in co-op. It&#x27;s a particularly chilled experience, though hopefully the free Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy 7 DLC packs will be included. The SpongeBob Squarepants and most recent Back to the Future DLCs are paid extras.


Also included is Sable, a sparse adventure game with a unique, line-drawn art style and music from Japanese Breakfast. Donlan described it as a &quot;mesmerising game of exploration&quot; in our Eurogamer Sable review.

Silent Hill: Ascension viewers suggested the show&#x27;s script was written by AI due to its abrupt tonal shifts and disjointed nature. The most notable examples of this being shared include the odd berry-man to this argument which is swiftly resolved by... nothing.
Speaking up on X (née Twitter), Genvid CEO Jacob Navok denied Ascension has been written by AI as people are speculating, and revealed Genvid&#x27;s previous tests with AI were fruitless.

In a presentation of the company&#x27;s recent financial quarterly report, sales of its mascot platformer were described as having a &quot;slightly weaker start than we had anticipated&quot;.


Then, in a newly released Q&amp;A following its recent financial report, president and group CEO Haruki Satomi and senior executive vice president and CFO Koichi Fukazawa were asked for the reason for the lower-than-expected sales so far.

                              <span>UK developer Creative Assembly will refocus on making real-time strategy games following the cancellation of online extraction shooter Hyenas.


In a presentation to investors, Creative Assembly owner Sega admitted that the Hyenas project had been an attempt to accelerate the studio&#x27;s growth - even though the game&#x27;s genre lay outside the developer&#x27;s usual area of expertise.

Hyenas was cancelled in September after years in development and a public demo at Gamescom only weeks before. The decision to cancel the project resulted in layoffs at Creative Assembly, with the majority of the project&#x27;s team believed to be at risk.

In a business update, the developer behind Planet Coaster, Planet Zoo and Jurassic World Evolution admitted that Warhammer sales had &quot;been lower than expected&quot; since its launch earlier this month, and that it was lowering its revenue forecast for the year. 


The news comes just a month after layoffs at the studio were announced, with an unknown number of people set to leave following an ongoing consultation period.

Screenshots and gameplay footage have now hit the internet, and show a scrubbed up version of the classic adventure game that players say is now playable in 4K.


Eurogamer was able to view 30 minutes of gameplay footage this morning via YouTube, though this has now been taken down by Ubisoft through a copyright claim.

We briefly got a look at this particular batsuit last month, when players noticed it cropping up prematurely in 2015&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Knight. 


Now, however, the suit is officially set to be part of the games. It will be a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.

Popular comedy panel show Taskmaster has joined forces with Scallywag Arcade to bring a virtual reality version of the hit show to VR helmets worldwide.
Launching in 2024 for Meta Quest 2 and 3 (the wacky physics-based action is too much for the Quest 1 to handle allegedly), Taskmaster VR will give players the chance to visit the Taskmaster house in order to take part in comical challenges like smashing watermelons or making the Taskmaster a lovely sandwich.

Word that Free Radical - a studio resurrected in 2021 specifically to revive the beloved TimeSplitters franchise - was the latest developer to be impacted by parent company Embracer&#x27;s restructuring first surfaced earlier this month in a report by VGC.


The publication&#x27;s sources have now shared a company wide email from Wingefors confirming that Free Radical is currently engaged in a consultation process - as per UK employment law, employees must enter into a 30-day consultation process before redundancies can be made - that could result in the studio&#x27;s closure next month.

                              <span>In news that&#x27;ll surprise nobody who&#x27;s been following the various leaks leading up to today&#x27;s official announcement, Capcom has confirmed Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 22nd March next year.


That date first emerged earlier this month, when it was spotted as part of a (quickly removed) listing on the PEGI ratings website. It then prematurely resurfaced on Steam today, getting a little ahead of Capcom&#x27;s latest Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 showcase where it was finally made official.


And official it now is, with Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirming the news during a 15-minute livestream that also featured a lengthy new trailer. Tucked in there was an appearance from the previously unseen Talos, a truly colossal armoured soldier striding forth from the depths of the ocean that Capcom seems particularly proud of - so much so that we got an extended look at the fight once the trailer was over.

                              <span>CD Projekt has announced that Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for its sci-fi RPG Cyberpunk 2077, has sold 4.3m copies since launching this September - and that over 330 developers at the company are now working on the next Witcher game.


When last we heard from Phantom Liberty, CD Projekt revealed it had sold 3m copies in the first week of its release - news that was accompanied by updated sales figures for Cyberpunk 2077, which has now surpassed 25m copies sold since its rocky launch back in December 2020.


Word of Phantom Liberty&#x27;s 4.3m milestone comes via CD Projekt&#x27;s latest financial earnings report, which also includes an update on how the company&#x27;s developers are currently split between its various projects. As of October, around half the studio - later confirmed to be approximately 330 developers by CEO Adam Kiciński in an earnings call - was working on the next Witcher game, with that number expected to rise to over 400 by &quot;mid-next year&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s beleaguered pirate adventure Skull and Bones is - following yet another delay back in October - reportedly now targeting a 16th February release next year.


Skull and Bones has, of course, been a very long time in the making, with development starting over a decade a go in 2013. Since then, it&#x27;s suffered repeated delays (it was originally expected to arrive in 2018), most recently seeing its release shift to Q4 of Ubisoft&#x27;s current financial year, meaning a launch within the January-March 2024 period.


And Ubisoft has now reportedly narrowed that previous launch window down to 16th February 2024 according to Insider Gaming, which has a good track record when it comes to Ubisoft leaks. The site says the publisher is likely to make the new release date official in &quot;the next couple of weeks&quot;, potentially during December&#x27;s The Game Awards.

NCsoft head Taekjin Kim and Sony&#x27;s Jim Ryan signed this partnership, with the companies now set to &quot;collaborate in various global business fields, including mobile&quot; together.


While no specifics were mentioned, the two companies stated they are &quot;evaluating a range of potential opportunities with an aim to foster strategic synergy&quot;. This will include leveraging NCsoft&#x27;s &quot;technological prowess&quot; as well as Sony&#x27;s &quot;global leadership in the entertainment field&quot;.

                              <span>They’re not that good:
Security researchers Jesse D’Aguanno and Timo Teräs write that, with varying degrees of reverse-engineering and using some external hardware, they were able to fool the Goodix fingerprint sensor in a Dell Inspiron 15, the Synaptic sensor in a Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and the ELAN sensor in one of Microsoft’s own Surface Pro Type Covers. These are just three laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we’ve reviewed in the last few years. It’s likely that most Windows PCs with fingerprint readers will be vulnerable to similar exploits...</span>

Recently, the Gateway API announced its v1.0 GA release, marking a huge milestone for the project.
Along with stabilizing some of the core functionality in the API, a number of exciting new experimental features have been added.
Backend TLS Policy
BackendTLSPolicy is a new Gateway API type used for specifying the TLS configuration of the connection from the Gateway to backend Pods via the Service API object.
It is specified as a Direct PolicyAttachment without defaults or overrides, applied to a Service that accesses a backend, where the BackendTLSPolicy resides in the same namespace as the Service to which it is applied.

                              <span>Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games are facing a class-action lawsuit over the removal of purchased in-game currencies from accounts when a game&#x27;s online features are taken offline.

The lawsuit (as spotted by Axios) was filed by J.A., a minor, and his mother, acting as his representative and next friend, to the federal court of Northern District of California on 17th November.

In the lawsuit, Take-Two and 2K&#x27;s annual sports franchises NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and PGA Tour 2K are named for offering in-game upgrades which require in-game (virtual) currency. The virtual currency can be bought with real-world money.

In a statement, Fishlabs parent company Plaion (itself owned by Embracer) confirmed a &quot;restructuring&quot; at the studio &quot;expected to impact around 50 positions&quot;. 

&quot;Despite exhaustive efforts to avoid downsizing, the lack of approval and therefore financing for the studio&#x27;s unannounced project (also referred to as &quot;Project Black&quot;) has made this step unavoidable,&quot; a spokesperson said today. &quot;The remaining team will continue to work on the existing co-development projects in partnership with other Plaion and Embracer Group studios.

Maximus is the new squire for a Power Suit knight who has been dispatched on behalf of The Brotherhood of Steel. Curious.

                              <span>Some of the material which will feature in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&#x27;s Lost Levels is also planned to appear in the second season of HBO&#x27;s show, Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann has teased. 


Earlier this month, Naughty Dog announced a remastered and native PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2. Along with souped up visuals for the base game, this upcoming release will also have a few other bells and whistles including cut content in the form of &#x27;Lost Levels&#x27; for players to experience. These Lost Levels will be Sewers, Jackson Party and Boar Hunt.


Meanwhile, almost in tandem with The Last of Us Part 2&#x27;s remastered release, production on the second season of HBO&#x27;s adaptation is set to kick off early next year. While we know the second season of the show will not encompass the entirety of The Last of Us Part 2&#x27;s narrative, the series&#x27; creator has said &quot;at least one element&quot; of the previously mentioned cut content is &quot;planned for the show&quot;.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s customer support team has been responding to negative Starfield reviews on Steam.


Starfield had a strong start, becoming the &quot;biggest Bethesda game launch&quot; of all time. Those numbers rose over the first few days of release, with Starfield&#x27;s concurrent player count previously beating Skyrim&#x27;s concurrent player record on Steam. 


But despite these initial player numbers, Starfield currently sits with a &#x27;Mixed&#x27; review status on Steam. At the time of writing, 69 percent of the game&#x27;s 80,365 reviews on the platform are positive. The rest are, obviously, less generous.

                              <span>Larian Studios says it&#x27;s aiming to release Patch 5 for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 later this week. The update will include a fix for performance issues in Act 3, Astarion&#x27;s kisses, and more. 
Since Patch 4 was released at the beginning of the month, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 players have experienced slowdown in Act 3. The performance issues were introduced in the patch, Larian stated on X (née Twitter), and resulted in tag crimes like theft and violence being tagged as &quot;eternally-active&quot;, regardless of whether or not players were spotted by NPCs.
Larian director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the slowdown is caused by a specific bug in Moonrise Towers during Act 2. Patch 5 will address this and &quot;so much more,&quot; Douse wrote, when it hopefully drops later this week. Mostly I&#x27;m just looking forward to being able to ask Astarion for a kiss and actually receive one.

                              <span>Bungie will now launch its climactic Destiny 2 expansion The Final Shape on 4th June 2024.


The four-month delay was previously leaked following news of job cuts at the studio, and a sense that the game&#x27;s big finale expansion needed more time. Bungie&#x27;s other announced game project Marathon has also reportedly been delayed - and will now launch in 2025.


In a blog post today, Bungie confirmed that The Final Shape did indeed need longer &quot;to become exactly what we want it to be&quot;.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I wanted to share a quick update about Eurogamer, and its future which now looks to lie outside the Reedpop business.


If you&#x27;ve been reading for a while you may know Eurogamer has been around a few years (24!) and spent most of that time as part of the family-run Gamer Network. 


Five years ago, Gamer Network was bought by Reedpop, the pop culture-focused arm of events company Reed Exhibitions, which already ran PAX and New York Comic-Con.

                              <span>NCSoft unveiled new trailers for its upcoming games Project M and LLL at G-Star 2023 which show off new features.

Project M is a narrative thriller which we first saw in June 2022 with a trailer filled with quicktime events reminiscent of Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human. The game looks packed with drama, family, violence, and the supernatural. LLL was announced a few months later in November 2022 and is a sci-fi MMO set in an alternate history which caused modern-day Seoul, the Byzantine Empire and the 23rd century to become entangled with one another.
The trailer for Project M gives us a look at a new environment, a brightly lit but dilapidated theme park. There&#x27;s also some stealth and action sections which aren&#x27;t driven by quicktime events, so there&#x27;ll be some variety in the game&#x27;s combat.

The company, the parent of Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse, called this a &quot;difficult&quot; decision to make. 

&quot;We regularly review our businesses and make adjustments to centre on long-term strategic growth areas,&quot; a spokesman for the ByteDance said in a statement shared with Reuters. &quot;Following a recent review, we&#x27;ve made the difficult decision to restructure our gaming business.&quot;

This includes its Story Mode, a feature which was promised as part of Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds&#x27; initial Indiegogo campaign. 


The studio slipped this news in rather casually towards the end of a recent blog update about the game, where it detailed its upcoming DLC characters.

When discussing her wider portfolio, McDonnell said she often takes inspiration from her own experiences when writing characters. &quot;Most of my stories start with whatever funk or crisis or feeling I&#x27;m living in, then I figure out how to explore that through speculative fiction,&quot; McDonnell shared.

The recruitment advertisement, which went live earlier this week, makes a clear connection between the success of the sci-fi shooter&#x27;s multiplayer game and the ability to &quot;work directly&quot; with the Halo community and players who make their own maps and assets in its map-making mode, Forge.

&quot;In this role you&#x27;ll design, implement, and manage playlists that align with the needs of Halo Infinite. You&#x27;ll work with partner teams to ensure content (maps and modes) is properly represented in our playlists and aligns with scheduled game events,&quot; the ad explains.

The companies say that &quot;at the heart of Empower Up&quot; is a practical Health Check tool that companies can use to benchmark where they are &quot;on their EDI journey&quot;, as well as provide further advice and guidance on how to move forward. 

&quot;Empower Up is suitable for all games companies, wherever they are on their EDI journey,&quot; Ukie says. &quot;For those looking to gain more understanding about what EDI is and why it’s important, the Intro To EDI section provides an overview. It also provides a summary of different Diversity Characteristics and Under-Represented Groups, along with some specific advice and guidance on each.

                              <span>Nier series producer Yosuke Saito has confirmed that while &quot;[director] Yoko Taro is alive&quot;, new Nier games will be released.

In an interview with 4Gamer.net (日本語) and shared by Genki, Saito said that while another Nier game would be coming, the duo was currently working on a &quot;separate&quot; project, and teased that we can expect to hear more about that unannounced game next year.

The news came via &quot;a meeting to talk incessantly about the production of Nier Automata&quot; presentation at the Korean video game show G-STAR 2023 – yes, I love the title, too – in which Saito talked about the development of the original game and hinted at what lay ahead for the fan-favourite series.

                              <span>The Division: Heartland has been rated in Taiwan.

The free-to-play third-person action-shooter spin-off was announced in May 2021 and was initially set to release in 2021-22. Ubisoft has since been taciturn about the game&#x27;s release window, but the rating – which was published earlier this month – intimates that we could be getting a firm release date soon.

Because of &quot;violence, inappropriate language&quot;, and &quot;anti-society&quot; leanings – make of that what you will – the shooter has been awarded a PG-15 rating on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.

According to the letter, a surveillance program now known as Data Analytical Services (DAS) has for more than a decade allowed federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to mine the details of Americans’ calls, analyzing the phone records of countless people who are not suspected of any crime, including victims. Using a technique known as chain analysis, the program targets not only those in direct phone contact with a criminal suspect but anyone with whom those individuals have been in contact as well...</span>

                              <span>Valve boss Gabe Newell has been ordered to appear in court as part of an antitrust lawsuit filed by Wolfire Games.

As first reported by our friends at GamesIndustry.biz, Wolfire Games – which filed the order earlier this month – brought an antitrust lawsuit against the megacorp back in 2021. Whilst Newell requested a remote deposition due to health concerns, admitting he has &quot;structured his life to minimise exposure to possible COVID-19 transmission&quot;, Wolfire insists that there is &quot;insubstantial evidence to suggest that he is at particularised risk of serious illness&quot; and wants him there in person. 

Wolfire further asserts that Newell needs to attend in person because it believes he is &quot;uniquely positioned to testify on all aspects of [Valve&#x27;s] business strategy&quot;, and the company wants to &quot;adequately assess Newell&#x27;s credibility&quot;.

According to content creator Gabe Follower, the prototype – called Terror Strike – was &quot;accidentally compiled&quot; and added to the Counter-Strike update, showing how the zombie game&#x27;s DNA lies firmly in the mod for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and was developed using CS assets, including Counter-Strike weapons.

The files were quickly pulled from the 22nd November update, but not quickly enough to stop them being yoinked and then distributed publicly.

At the time of writing, a sequel to Introversion Software&#x27;s wildly popular management sim has not been formally announced, yet Prison Architect 2 has been rated as suitable for &quot;juvelines&quot; by Korea&#x27;s Game Rating and Administration Committee. 

Interestingly, the link that once led to the rating is now dead, and the game doesn&#x27;t turn up if you search for it, either in English or Korean. So make of that what you will.

On 7th and 8th December 2023, the fictitious agency will be open in central London for fans to get involved in the &quot;immersive pop-up installation&quot; and try out the expansion pack, which – coincidentally enough – also releases on 7th December. 

&quot;Aspiring agents and property magnates will not only have the opportunity to get hands-on with the newest expansion pack, but they’ll be able to interact with their favourite characters, Simify themselves in pictures and discover the new world of Tomarang!&quot; EA explains.

                              <span>A Switch rating for Borderlands Collection: Pandora&#x27;s Box has popped up in Germany.

Right now, the collection is only available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and has not yet been confirmed for Switch, which only received a Borderlands 3 port back in October, four years after the threequel was released on other platforms.

Interestingly, it was submitted for classification quite some time ago – the website says Pandora&#x27;s Box was given its 14+ rating back in August – but it&#x27;s only now come to the attention of the eagle-eyed folks on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit and has yet to be added to the Nintendo eShop.

                              <span>Activision wants to recommend games to you based on the livestreams you watch.

According to a patent filed in July and published publicly just last week – snappily entitled &quot;systems and methods of dynamically modifying video game content based on non-video game content being concurrently experienced by a user&quot; – Activision wants to keep track of what you watch and use that data to make personalised recommendations to you.

As spotted by Exputer, this would make a typically passive viewing experience more interactive, and could even mean &quot;generating&quot; a game just for you or modifying an existing game&#x27;s content to better suit the kinds of things you like to watch in livestreams.

                              <span>Back in August, as part of this year&#x27;s TennoCon celebrations, Warframe developer Digital Extremes unveiled Whispers in the Walls, the next (and extremely weird) chapter in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter&#x27;s ongoing saga. And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion&#x27;s release, including confirmation it&#x27;ll arrive alongside cross-save support.


Whispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It&#x27;s an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos, and one that&#x27;ll reveal the &quot;proverbial big bang&quot; that kicked off every event in Warframe.


In terms of enemies, the labyrinthine laboratory plays host to a much-expanded Necramech faction, including new Necrodogs, that players can battle using Whispers in the Walls&#x27; new Grimoire, a secondary weapon capable of flinging pages of devastating Void. But that&#x27;s not the expansion&#x27;s only new threat; at certain points, players will find themselves whisked away from the gothic gloom of Albrecht&#x27;s lab to a vast Eldritch desert that serves as the home of the mysterious Man in the Wall. Here, they&#x27;ll encounter a second new faction, the Murmur, nightmarish multi-limbed creatures resembling tech-infused biblical angels.

                              <span>Super Mario RPG&#x27;s recently released Switch remake is a lovely thing, freshening up a much-loved classic for a new generation, while ensuring its core remains faithful enough that it can deliver a wonderful blast of nostalgia for long-time fans. And it turns out that faithfulness runs deep, with players having discovered it restores a fun little easter egg that was cut from the original version during the localisation process for release outside of Japan.


More specifically, the 1996 Japanese version of Super Mario RPG contained a cute - if ultimately fairly pointless - sequence that would trigger if players entered the cheat code &#x27;Down, Up, Right, Left, L, R, L, R, B&#x27; on the pause screen.


Rather than showering players with treats to make the experience a little easier or give everyone a massive head, as cheat codes tended to do at the time, entering Super Mario RPG&#x27;s sequence of button presses would instead cause Toad to materialise and ponder what the secret code you just entered could possibly have done.

The Squid Nebula is shown in blue, indicating doubly ionized oxygen—­which is when you ionize your oxygen once and then ionize it again just to make sure. (In all seriousness, it likely indicates a low-mass star nearing the end of its life).

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                              <span>Ubisoft has said that pop-up adverts seen last night within Assassin&#x27;s Creed games have now been disabled, and were the result of a technical error. 


The adverts, which promoted other games in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series that are currently on sale for Black Friday, were spotted by some players yesterday evening, prompting complaints online.


Players reported seeing the adverts pop-up when they paused the action to load the in-game map. One example shared on X, formerly Twitter, shows an advert for 20 percent off Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage fill the screen when a player accesses the map within Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.

The developer shared this milestone as part of a Thanksgiving post, stating it was grateful to everyone who had visited Arcadia Bay with Max and Chloe and experienced Life is Strange&#x27;s time maniplating and emotionally charged story.


&quot;We want to thank each and every one of you for playing,&quot; the account wrote, with an accompanying reel showing moments from the game (which made me get a little choked up, I won&#x27;t lie).

Luke&#x27;s stream ended abruptly last night as sirens were heard in the background, and as he received a call warning him that police were outside. 


&quot;Oh nice,&quot; he said. &quot;Alright I&#x27;ve gotta go, now these assholes have swatted my house.&quot;

Kamiya&#x27;s comments come as part of his most recent YouTube video, where the PlatinumGames co-founder said he fully expects the Bayonetta franchise to continue without him. 


&quot;I worked on Bayonetta 1, 2, 3 and Origins,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ve talked about this in various interviews, that the Bayonetta series would consist of a total of nine episodes, and that I wanted to grow the franchise as the Bayonetta &#x27;Saga&#x27;, but it seems like I may have to take the full saga to the grave with me.&quot;

                              <span>American Truck Simulator rumbles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has announced it&#x27;ll be making its next stop, this time in the state of Kansas - the destination of its newest paid expansion - next Thursday, 30th November. Plus, its substantial 1.49 update - which adds a dynamic night sky, the moon, HDR skyboxes, and more - is out now.


Kansas was confirmed to be the focus of American Truck Simulator &#x27;s next, post-Oklahoma expansion back in February, bringing the tally of explorable states in the game up to 14, joining the previously released California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma.


American Truck Simulator&#x27;s rendition of Kansas - or the Sunflower State, if you will - promises to give potential visitors and their hefty transportation a tour of the area&#x27;s &quot;native grasslands, streams, abundant blue skies, and green grassland vistas&quot;. You can see some of that across copious screenshots in SCS&#x27; launch date announcement post.

                              <span>As families come together to gorge on turkey/give thanks for Doctor Who being 60, what better way to mark the occasion than with a bit of a (spacey) freebie from the Epic Games Store, specifically in the form of Deliver Us Mars?


Deliver Us Mars, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is this year&#x27;s sequel to developer KeokeN Interactive&#x27;s 2018 sci-fi puzzle-adventure Deliver Us the Moon. For this secound outing, players step into the massive space clogs of an astronaut, Kathy, as she travels to the red planet in search of her missing father and technology that might just help save Earth from ecological disaster. 


What follows is a mix of first-person platforming and puzzle solving reminiscent of its predecessor, although it doesn&#x27;t appear Deliver Us Mars enjoyed quite as positive a critical reception as the fist game. Still, free is free, so if some cerebral spacey excitement appeals, you&#x27;ll want to be pointing yourself toward the Epic Games Store over the next seven days.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss this year&#x27;s various video game remakes and remasters, including the recently-announced The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which is headed to PlayStation 5 in January.
While TLOU2 was launched on PS4, it&#x27;s still just three years on from that game&#x27;s arrival. How do we feel about there already being a &quot;Remaster&quot;, and are its DVD extra-style additions worth a £10 upgrade? 
We also discuss some of the other remakes to arrive (again) this year, including the excellent new versions of Dead Space and Resident Evil 4. It&#x27;s good these games are finding new audiences, but are we in danger of focusing too much on the past, and on safe, known franchises? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer&#x27;s Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The group­—known by many names, including Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM, Armageddon, and Shuckworm—has been active since at least 2014 and has been attributed to Russia’s Federal Security Service by the Security Service of Ukraine. Most Kremlin-backed groups take pains to fly under the radar; Gamaredon doesn’t care to.

Welcome to another edition of the SIG spotlight blog series, where we
highlight the incredible work being done by various Special Interest
Groups (SIGs) within the Kubernetes project. In this edition, we turn
our attention to SIG Testing,
a group interested in effective testing of Kubernetes and automating
away project toil. SIG Testing focus on creating and running tools and
infrastructure that make it easier for the community to write and run
tests, and to contribute, analyze and act upon test results.
To gain some insights into SIG Testing, Sandipan
Panda spoke with Michelle Shepardson,
a senior software engineer at Google and a chair of SIG Testing, and
Patrick Ohly, a software engineer and architect at
Intel and a SIG Testing Tech Lead.

Tekken 8 developer Bandai Namco has also listed 16 GB RAM as its recommended memory requirement. While this does seem to be along the standard line for PC games today, it is still twice that of Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s memory recommendations.

But you&#x27;ll actually need two phones to play it - one to act as a controller, while a separate mobile device needs to have the Amico Controller app installed and be connected to the same wireless network.
Alternatively, Intellivision states the official Amico hardware controllers are compatible with the app via Bluetooth, except they haven&#x27;t been released yet and the company didn&#x27;t specify when customers can expect them.

The report, conducted by Atomik Research for SuperScale&#x27;s Good Games Don&#x27;t Die and shared by Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz, was based on interviews with 500 game developers, from both here in the UK and across the pond in the US. 


The report stated the majority of mobile games reached peak revenue within the first 12 months of their release. While 76 percent reach their peak revenue in the first year, only four percent peak in the second year of release.

It leaves you looking like some kind of human Call of Duty snake, but it also leaves you able to zoom around while lying prone - a very handy tactic for winning gunfights.


Now, Sledgehammer has taken notice and dubbed Call of Duty snaking as a PC exploit to be looked at further. &quot;We&#x27;re investigating an exploit that allows players to sprint while appearing in the prone animation,&quot; the developer wrote on the official CODUPdates account on X, formerly Twitter.

                              <span>Andrzej Sapkowski may have penned The Witcher novels, which in turn inspired both CD Projekt Red&#x27;s video game series and Netflix&#x27;s TV adaptation, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the streaming service ever listened to his feedback.


While attending Vienna Comic Con, Sapkowski was asked about the various adaptations that have stemmed from his original works. Speaking with Cerealkillers, the author said that every visual adaptation of his The Witcher series was &quot;strange&quot; for him to see, because as a writer he only uses his words.


&quot;My raw material when I work, it&#x27;s only letters. I do not describe pictures. I don&#x27;t see any pictures. I use the letters only because I know that my reader will see in the book the letters only, not the pictures. So I have to do with my letters to make the reader imagine the picture, not the other way around... so every [visual] adaptation, it&#x27;s simply strange for me,&quot; he explained.

                              <span>The world has been given a tiny glimpse into the uber-secretive world of Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar North thanks to a fascinating new blog from former technical director Obbe Vermeij, who, in just a few short weeks, has shed light on the studio&#x27;s cancelled spy game Agent, discussed a zombie game abandoned by the company after it was deemed to be too &quot;depressing&quot;, and more.


Vermeij served as technical director at Rockstar North from 1995 (when the studio was still known as DMA Design) to 2009, meaning his time at the company spanned the creation of Grand Theft Auto as a series right through to Grand Theft Auto 4 and its DLC.


Since launching his blog earlier this month, Vermeij has been sharing anecdotes covering a number of Rockstar games, touching on everything from the company&#x27;s streaming tech for Grand Theft Auto 3 - which struggled enough that the art team was forced to shove a building in the middle of a long stretch of Portland road to ensure players wouldn&#x27;t run out of city while loading continued - to early efforts at implementing multiplayer in GTA 3.

                              <span>Following some initial rumblings earlier this year, a new report has lend further credence to suggestions 2024&#x27;s Call of Duty game will be another entry in the Black Ops series, this one now said to be taking place in the Gulf War.


Word that Call of Duty 2024 would be a new Black Ops game first surfaced back in February, when it was claimed next year&#x27;s series entry was being developed by Treyarch under the codename Cerberus. Furher evidence backing this up arrived in July, when actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford shared a Facebook post referencing Black Ops and claiming his likeness would be used for next year&#x27;s main character, &quot;Ratcliff&quot;.


And that brings us to a new report from Windows Central which, citing &quot;multiple sources familiar with Activision&#x27;s plans&quot;, says next year&#x27;s Call of Duty &quot;is indeed Black Ops&quot;. The publication also claims the game will attempt to &quot;explore a nuanced narrative of the Gulf War, with a critical focus on different participants within the conflict.&quot;

                              <span>With winter looming, THQ Nordic has seized this most seasonally appropriate opportunity to showcase more of its upcoming South Park: Snow Day, with its latest trailer revealing a smattering of new gameplay for the co-op adventure.


South Park: Snow Day was initially teased back in August last year, making a sneaky post-credits appearance at the very end of THQ Nordic&#x27;s 2022 showcase. One year on, it made a second showcase appearance, this time to confirm its title, unveil its decidedly un-TV-show like 3D visual style, and reveal a handful of other details.


We know, for instance, that South Park: Snow Day (which is being developed by The Blackout Club studio Question) is a co-op adventure in which up to four players - along with familiar faces including Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny - enjoy their day away from school by battling through the snow-blanketed South Park streets on a quest to save the world.

                              <span>Sony must face a £5bn lawsuit that alleges gamers have been repeatedly overcharged for PlayStation products, following a decision this week by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal.
The lawsuit was originally filed in August 2022 by ex-managing director of Which? UK Alex Neill, on behalf of UK PlayStation users.
Neill&#x27;s application for a collective proceedings order against Sony accuses the PlayStation maker of anti-competitive practices such as imposing unfair terms on developers and forcing prices up for consumers.

                              <span>There&#x27;s some bad news if you were hoping to get your Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 fix anytime soon; publisher Focus Entertainment has announced a substantial delay for the third-person sci-fi shooter, which is now expected to arrive in the second half of next year.


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - which follows the continuing adventures of original series protagonist Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus (once again voiced by Mark Strong) - was originally due to launch in &quot;winter&quot; this year, but Focus has now announced a delay as part of an &quot;update on execution of the line-up and partnerships&quot;.


As per Focus&#x27; revised release schedule, Space Marine 2 - which is being developed by Saber Interactive - will now launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC in the &quot;second half of 2024&quot;, with Focus saying the delay will &quot;provide the time needed to properly polish the game and to ensure the best possible experience&quot;.

                              <span>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, one fan has released an animated short of Castle Town reimagined as a setting in a Studio Ghibli film.
YouTuber RwanLink said the environment and characters took four months to make in Unreal Engine 5, and totals to over 600 hours of work whilst also in a full-time job.
The short video follows Link as he leaves Kokiri Forest for Hyrule Castle, and we bump into some familiar faces such as Malon, the Happy Mask Shop Owner, and even Skyward Sword&#x27;s Fi skating around the Master Sword.

                              <span>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has claimed Google offered him what &quot;seemed like a crooked arrangement&quot; in order to persuade the company to release Fortnite in the Google Play Store rather than through its own website.
Sweeney made the statement when he took to the witness stand yesterday in the ongoing trial between Epic and Google.
As reported by AP, Sweeney described a meeting between himself and Google at the latter&#x27;s headquarters to discuss an agreement which would see Epic release Fortnite on the Play Store. &quot;It seemed like a crooked arrangement,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;Google was proposing a series of side deals which seemed designed to convince Epic not to compete against them,&quot; he continued.

The DLCs will mark the final release from Mimimi before it closes as it announced back in August. At the time, studio co-founders  Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth revealed it was working on a &quot;big content drop&quot; for Shadow Gambit, which we know now is in the form of two expansion.
Each expansion will include a new playable character with unique abilities, a new island to explore, and a story campaign told across six new missions. The new characters can be used in most of the main game&#x27;s missions and aren&#x27;t limited to the DLC missions, Mimimi stated.

                              <span>Ubisoft has given a brief update on its missing in action Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has had a troubled development and still lacks a formal release date. 


Originally announced back in 2020 for release the following year, work on the game was rebooted when development dragged on and the project was then moved from Ubisoft Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.


Updates from the project have since been scarce, though Ubisoft broke cover last night to state that the game was still very much in development and had recently &quot;passed an important internal milestone&quot;.

                              <span>Activision has said its new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has broken multiple player engagement records, without providing any specific player numbers. 


&quot;Just two weeks in, Modern Warfare 3 has already set records with the highest engagement in the new Modern Warfare trilogy,&quot; states a post by the Call of Duty account on X, formerly Twitter.


These records include the fact Modern Warfare 3 owners are playing &quot;more hours per player overall&quot; and &quot;campaign players [are] putting in more time per player&quot; than in the modern Modern Warfare 1 and 2.

                              <span>GameMaker, a series of cross-platform engines for game developers, has ditched its subscription model for non-commercial purposes, hobbyists and indie developers.
GameMaker will now be free for anyone using its software non-commercially on all non-console platforms. Creator and indie subscriptions have been replaced with a one-time fee of $100, meanwhile, which grants a commercial license and enables exports to desktop and mobile platforms.
The change appears to have been prompted by the recent and controversial changes Unity announced for its pricing model, which would introduce a fee for developers per game install. The plan was met with anger from indie developers, causing Unity to walk back significantly on its proposed changes.

This sci-fi third-person shooter was developed during the N64 heyday of British studio Rare, and launched during the four-year period the company also released classics such as GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64 and Perfect Dark. 


It may not have the brand power of some of those, but it&#x27;s still a solid arcade-inspired adventurey shooter with a lengthy single-player and a deathmatch-style multiplayer.

                              <span>Conveniently timed to coincide with the launch of this year&#x27;s Steam autumn sale, Blizzard has announced a free trial week for Diablo 4 - plus discounts across all versions of the game - starting today and running until 28th November.


Diablo 4&#x27;s free trial lets players dip their toes into the world of Sanctuary, and includes full access to co-op and crossplay, but there&#x27;s one major limitation: progression is capped at level 20. Exactly how much playtime that equates to is a little unclear, especially given Diablo 4&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Blessing event is also now live, boosting XP and Gold by 35% until 27th November.


Regardless, Blizzard says all trial progress can be carried over to the full game should your time with Diablo 4 convince you to make a purchase. And there&#x27;s additional incentive to do so, considering all versions of the game are currently discounted by 40% as part of the Steam  sale.

                              <span>If your life has been upsetting devoid of underwater terror since polishing off Subnautica: Below Zero, a glimmer of nautical promise is on the (distant) horizon, with publisher Krafton confirming the next instalment in the ocean survival series is anticipateed to arrive in the first half of 2025.


Official word that a new Subnautica game was on the way first surfaced in April last year, when developer Unknown Worlds - the studio behind the series&#x27; original 2018 entry and its 2021 follow-up Subnautica: Below Zero - announced it was seeking a senior narrative designer to &quot;help shape the next game in the Subnautica universe&quot;.


And now, a little over 18 months later, the new Subnautica has made an appearance in publisher Krafton&#x27;s slate of upcoming releases, as shared via the deeply unsexy means of financial report PowerPoint slide presentation (thanks Rock Paper Shotgun). It&#x27;s set to launch in &quot;1H25&quot; - the first half of 2025 - but, beyond that, details are limited.

                              <span>Back in September, Dave the Diver studio Mintrocket unveiled Nakwon: Last Paradise, a 16-player stealth-survival extraction game set on the streets of Seoul amid an undead apocalypse, and now - with a public pre-alpha playtest looming - it&#x27;s shared 22 minutes of gameplay.


Nakwon is a game of two parts; the primary focus is Scouting, requiring players (either solo or in a team of two) to leave the titular safe zone in order to scavenge for resources out in the city. Being a PvPvE experience, the threats outside are twofold: there&#x27;re the zombies - which can&#x27;t be killed, meaning stealth is key to survival - alongside other human scavengers, who&#x27;ll either need to be avoided or set upon with makeshift weaponry (firearms are a scare commodity).


Players can come and go as they like, meaning once they&#x27;re satisfied with their haul, they can return to the safe zone, where Nakwon&#x27;s more simulation-focused activities occur. Here, hard-gained resources can be sold for money, which is used to increase Citizen Grades and secure better priveliges and benefits. &quot;Every day, you must decide whether to go out for Scouting or staying inside,&quot; Mintrocket explained previously. &quot;But, you must consistently secure more food to avoid starvation and make the best choice whenever an unexpected event occurs.&quot;

While it has been easy to find Steam games that support Xbox controllers, Valve has now built upon this function to make finding games that support both the DualSense and its predecessor the DualShock a doddle.


As part of an upgraded controller-friendly hub, Steam users can explore games by controller type when browsing the vast library. It will &quot;default&quot; to the controller any given user played with most recently, but there is also the option to adjust the filters.

                              <span>Signal has had the ability to manually authenticate another account for years. iMessage is getting it:
The feature is called Contact Key Verification, and it does just what its name says: it lets you add a manual verification step in an iMessage conversation to confirm that the other person is who their device says they are. (SMS conversations lack any reliable method for verification­—sorry, green-bubble friends.) Instead of relying on Apple to verify the other person’s identity using information stored securely on Apple’s servers, you and the other party read a short verification code to each other, either in person or on a phone call. Once you’ve validated the conversation, your devices maintain a chain of trust in which neither you nor the other person has given any private encryption information to each other or Apple. If anything changes in the encryption keys each of you verified, the Messages app will notice and provide an alert or warning...</span>

                              <span>Fortnite has put a date on its next big live event - its first for a full year - now formally named as The Big Bang. 


This is the moment Fortnite will transition out of its current OG guise, which has seen all-time record engagement as the game&#x27;s original map returned, and into something brand new.


The Big Bang will take place live within Fortnite on Saturday 2nd December at 7pm UK time (that&#x27;s 2pm Eastern, or 11am Pacific), with online leaks suggesting a huge music star will be making a surprise in-game appearance.

The action-adventure game is set to release on 2nd February, 2024, and the test represents a &quot;smaller, specific section of the campaign and will not be representative of the full/final experience&quot; Warner Bros. stated.
The alpha test will take place across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S from 3pm UK time on 30th November to 8am UK time on 5th December. If you&#x27;re interested in getting involved, you&#x27;ll need to register on the official Suicide Squad website.

                              <span>Court documents from the ongoing Epic Games vs Google antitrust case reveal the internet giant wanted to take over the Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer, and was willing to work with shareholder Tencent to complete a buyout.
A quick reminder of how we got here: in August 2020, Epic implemented a method to circumvent Apple and Google fees on in-game payments in the iOS and Android versions of Fortnite. The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, and the case against Apple was settled in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts. Earlier this year, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties.
Now Epic is back in court to wage its case against Google. While the court battle between Epic and Apple brought us the bizarre moment in which banana mascot Peely&#x27;s decency was questioned in (apologies, in the tuxedo he&#x27;s known as Agent Peely), so far the proceedings with Google have been revealing in a slightly different way.

The Steam version contains the full series of five episodes, which released between July and September on PlayStation, Xbox and the Epic Store, with the bonus DLC Archangel available to buy separately.
The Expanse: A Telltale Series serves as a prequel to the popular sci-fi TV show of the same name, and sees Cara Gee reprise her role as Camina Drummer.

CDPR&#x27;s Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is set to release across Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC (both physically and digitally, although, given the art work, it looks like it will still be a PC download code.

In a statement to Axios, Ubisoft said it has disabled advertising for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR, the recently-launched spin-off from its blockbuster series designed for virtual reality headsets.

This update was previously available as part of a Steam beta, but it is now available for all players. 


Along with the much requested DLSS support for those Starfield players with compatible graphics cards, this update also covers a variety of other fixes and features across the board.

The Alan Wake 2 developer has just shared the knitting pattern for Saga Anderson&#x27;s rather fetching Nordic-inspired jumper (which was made by her mother, you know).


The cosy jumper features a festive pattern, which includes a deer and tree motif. It is ideal for this time of year, when the nights are longer and - where I live, at least - quite a lot colder.

                              <span>Two ex-Niantic employees are taking the Pokémon Go maker to court over claims of sexual bias in the workplace.


The lawsuit is set to be contested in Los Angeles tomorrow by Niantic, which is seeking to dismiss the case and move the matter into arbitration - something the company claims its former employees previously agreed to.


The legal dispute originally began in July, when a Niantic staff member left jobless by this summer&#x27;s job cull at the company alleged that it had been a &quot;boys club&quot; and that she had been paid less than a male colleague despite being in a more senior job role.

TAG has observed four different groups exploiting the same bug to steal email data, user credentials, and authentication tokens. Most of this activity occurred after the initial fix became public on Github. To ensure protection against these types of exploits, TAG urges users and organizations to keep software fully up-to-date and apply security updates as soon as they become available.

The vulnerability was discovered in June. It has been patched...</span>

The studio posted an updated roadmap to Steam, and Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen expanded on the decision to delay the DLC in a new developer diary.
&quot;We are committed to bringing the marketed DLC content to you,&quot; Hallikainen wrote, &quot;but it will not be landing in the originally promoted schedule.&quot; Instead, the studio is focusing on improving the game&#x27;s performance on PC before working on the delayed console release and DLC packs.

Krueger said the decision to move on was a &quot;very difficult&quot; one, but he was confident Housemarque&#x27;s &quot;brightest chapter&quot; is still ahead. 


&quot;During my 14 years at Housemarque, I&#x27;ve been incredibly fortunate to work on one dream project after another, and had the privilege of working alongside some truly talented and wonderful people along the way,&quot; Kruger wrote in a statement announcing his depature on the company&#x27;s website.

                              <span>If you are on the Premium tier of Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus subscription service, you can now have a go at both The Lord of the Rings: Gollum and Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, as part of the subscription&#x27;s trial offerings.


Users will be able to play up to an hour of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. 


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s trial, meanwhile, offers a more generous two hours of play time (although, given how vast the game actually is, this is really just a smidgen of the full release).

                              <span>The fate of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake is once again up in the air, after a new report that the game is not currently being worked on at developer Saber Interactive.
Development of the KOTOR remake has been rocky since it was first announced, and last week Lars Wingefors, CEO of Saber owner Embracer, refused to comment on the state of the game during an earnings presentation.
In response to this, Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb has stated the game is &quot;not being worked on right now&quot; according to sources close to the project. &quot;Full stop, this game is not being worked on in any way at any studio.&quot;

Aonic previously received a minority stake in nDreams - which is known for the likes of Synapse, Far Cry: Dive Into Insanity and Powerwash Simulator&#x27;s VR port - when it invested $35m in the VR-focused studio in March of last year. 


The company has now fully acquired nDreams for a total enterprise value close to $110m.

Bret Robbins made the statement in an interview with Windows Central, where he discussed the reception to Immortals of Aveum, the subsequent layoffs at the studio, and putting the game onto subscription services. 
Immortals of Aveum released on 22nd August 2023, which meant it was competing with the likes of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 (which &quot;no one anticipated&quot; would be so successful, Robbins said) and Armored Core 6, with Starfield releasing soon after. The studio knew Immortals&#x27; release date was in a packed window, and Robbins said &quot;trying to create awareness for us [as a new studio and IP] was really, really difficult&quot;.

                              <span>Insomniac Games&#x27; take on Wolverine is reportedly set to release in 2025 as a PlayStation 5 exclusive. 


That&#x27;s according to internet tipster DanielRPK , who is perhaps best known for their scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies.


DanielRPK said the upcoming Wolverine game will be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a much darker and more violent game than the studio&#x27;s Spider-Man titles. Additionally, the tipster has said it will feature Madripoor, Marvel&#x27;s fictional island often associated with X-Men stories (which popped up in the MCU relatively recently in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier TV series).

By spamming weapon attacks, ItsJinosaur has been able to fully customise the bathhouse/spa, arguably one of Stardew&#x27;s most overlooked, and under-used, landmarks.

&quot;The Bathhouse looked a little decrepit, so I decided to touch things up and made everything look better,&quot; ItsJinosuar explained on the game&#x27;s subreddit page.

As spotted by the Nintendo Switch subreddit, the collection – in which players &quot;traverse 2D pixellated environments using gadgets and vehicles to defeat small cartoony creatures&quot; – looks to be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.
Sadly, there&#x27;s no mention of an Xbox-flavoured release just yet.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has opened a &quot;brand new studio&quot; in Austin, Texas.

Confirmation came via a recruitment advertisement on Activision&#x27;s own website, in which the developer put out a call to recruit an &quot;expert UI engineer&quot; to work on Call of Duty at the new studio.

&quot;Founded in 2002, Infinity Ward is the original studio behind the Call of Duty franchise,&quot; the developer said. &quot;The titles developed by Infinity Ward have won more than 200 &#x27;Game of the Year&#x27; awards and 100 &#x27;Editor&#x27;s Choice&#x27; awards, among many other industry accolades.

                              <span>It looks like PUBG Studios&#x27; upcoming extraction shooter, Project Black Budget, will drop in the second half of 2024.

That&#x27;s according Krafton&#x27;s most recent financial report, which hints that the PvPvE shooter may release on the earlier side of its original 2024-2025 estimate. 

Project Black Budget first came to light in a different Krafton financial report earlier this year, described as a project destined to &quot;challenge ourselves to popularise the extraction shooter genre based on our PUBG production and service experience&quot;.

Numskull worked alongside Taito to &quot;accurately replicate the original 1978 and 1979 arcade cabinets&quot;, which went on sale this time last year. After quite the wait, pre-orders are now winging their way to players in the UK and Europe, and US players should expect their mini-cabinets in the next few weeks.

After signing 78 of the Space Invaders and 79 of the Space Invaders Part 2 cabinets – they released in 1978 and 1979 respectively – Nishikado spent a little time putting the machines through their paces, as captured in the brief clip below:

                              <span>Riot Games is rolling back changes it had planned to make to Riot IDs following a revolt from its own community.

Riot had originally intended to migrate all accounts to Riot ID and then restrict the number of times players could amend their IDs, as well as charge them $10 for the privilege of changing their online identifier. 

Now, however, Riot says that in response to community feedback, it has &quot;made some big updates to the plan&quot; and while it is still &quot;moving forward with Riot IDs&quot; – and Summoner names in League of Legends will be retired as planned from 20th November – it is no longer restricting players to one name change every 365 days. It will also now permit players to amend their names for free.

The free trial is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and gives you a chance to sample the opening three chapters for yourself. 

It&#x27;s unclear how long the trial will run for or whether or not your progress will carry on should you decide you like what you see and purchase the full game. You will, however, have to accept EA&#x27;s User Agreement and install the EA app in order to play, and if you decide to pay for any premium content whilst sampling the first three chapters, that won&#x27;t be refunded at the end of the trial.

                              <span>Following a swirl of reports earlier this year suggesting a new version of The Last of Us Part 2 was in the works, Naughty Dog has confirmed a remaster of its survival horror sequel - promising &quot;technological improvements, new modes, and new behind-the-scenes features&quot; - will launch for PlayStation 5 on 19th January 2024.


The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla made comments about &quot;new editions&quot; of The Last of Us Part 2 in July, and a Naughty Dog developer referenced a &quot;remastered&quot; version on LinkedIn in October. A recent PlayStation databse sighting all but gave the game away, but now it&#x27;s official, with Naughty Dog sharing the news in a post on the PlayStation Blog.


The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is a native PlayStation 5 version of the 2020 PS4 original promising various visual enhancements, including increased level-of-detail distances, improved shadow quality, better animation sampling rates, and more. It&#x27;ll feature two graphics modes - Fidelity and Performance, running at 4K and 1440p upscaled to 4K respectively - as well as an unlocked framerate option for VRR TVs.

                              <span>Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early issues with Fortnite&#x27;s newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.


Last month bought the news Epic would be introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a &quot;multi-game ecosystem&quot;. Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its recently released Creative 2.0 tools - and the game&#x27;s latest update means all these experiences now come with age ratings, starting at E for Everyone and going through E10+ up to Teen.


So far, so sensible. The problem is the seemingly haphazard way all this has been implemented in a game that has, up until now, been exclusively rated Teen. Essentially, as of Fortnite&#x27;s latest update, every single bit of content, including all cosmetics, has been given its own age rating - and players are being prevented from accessing Creative mode experiences if they&#x27;re wearing anything flagged as age-inappropriate. It doesn&#x27;t help either, that seemingly benign cosmetics skins - a muscular cartoon cat, for instance - are rated Teen-only and considered unsuitable for children, while others, such as Halloween&#x27;s Michael Myers are rated a-okay for the young &#x27;uns.

                              <span>Seminal first-person shooter Half-Life turns 25 this weekend, and developer Valve is celebrating the occasion with a special anniversary update adding new and restored content, alongside a bunch of other things. Oh, and it&#x27;s made the game free to claim and keep starting today.


Half-Life, for those too young or too in denial to remember, introduced the world to crowbar-toting science nerd Gordon Freeman on 19th November 1998 (Freeman&#x27;s full-life consequences wouldn&#x27;t materialise until sometime later), and anyone looking to relive their memories of those halcyon days now get to do so with some fancy extra bits thrown in.


Starting with the game itself, Half-Life has received a spot of gentle massaging for the modern era. There&#x27;s UI upscaling for higher resolutions (&quot;We built most of this stuff for 640x480 CRTs and apparently some of you have upgraded since then&quot;, says Valve), and it now supports Steam Networking play and proper gamepad config &quot;out of the box&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Aspyr Media has claimed the free cut content DLC it planned to release for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 on Switch was cancelled after objections from a &quot;third-party&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to Axios, which reports Aspyr made the claim as part of an ongoing lawsuit relating to the DLC&#x27;s failure to release, which was filed by a Malachi Mickelonis earlier this year. Mickelonis argues Aspyr and publisher Saber Interactive violated California consumer law by cancelling the DLC, and intentionally deceived purchasers &quot;in order to artificially raise sales revenues...based on qualities and features that the game simply did not possess&quot;.


Aspyr announced it was cancelling Knights of the Old Republic 2&#x27;s Restored Content DLC for Switch - which was to have been based on a popular PC fan mod built from unused story content found in the original game&#x27;s code - back in June, but did not offer an explanation at the time. Now, however, court documents reviewed by Axios quote Aspyr co-CEO Ted Saloch as saying the company &quot;believed it would be able to release the content, but a third party objected and Aspyr was unable to do so.&quot;

This is over the top, but is just another example of the extreme pressure ransomware gangs put on companies after seizing their data. Gangs are now going through the data, looking for particularly important or embarrassing pieces of data to threaten executives with exposing. I have heard stories of executives’ families being threatened, of consensual porn being identified (people regularly mix work and personal email) and exposed, and of victims’ customers and partners being directly contacted. Ransoms are in the millions, and gangs do their best to ensure that the pressure to pay is intense...</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has released a five minute recap video of Final Fantasy 7 Remake ahead of the release of Rebirth.


The video, narrated by flaming beast Red XIII, uses footage from the first game to detail the story so far. The video will also be viewable from the main menu of Rebirth, or you can watch it now in the embed below.


Last week rumours suggested this sort of recap video would be included. They were right, aside from it not being a 17 minute CG film.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what it&#x27;d feel like to be back in 1999, booting up your PSX and popping in a Dark Souls disc, then modder thegreatgramcracker over on Nexus Mods has got you covered with Pixel Souls: Demastered.  
The mod takes Dark Souls Remastered and replaces textures with pixel art based on the original game&#x27;s textures, decreases model quality, and reduces the quality of music and sound effects for a &quot;fun, somewhat cursed, &#x27;retro&#x27; feel,&quot; says thegreatgramcracker.
Demakes and demasters have seen a boom over the past few years, and Dark Souls now joins the likes of other FromSoftware games, including Bloodborne and Elden Ring to receive the lo-fi treatment.

Marc Whitten, president and general manager of Unity Create (the team responsible for the engine), also stated the company is &quot;doubling down on the areas that our creators care about the most, specifically the engine&quot;, following a fallout with developers over its controversial Runtime Fee policy.

                              <span>A PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 has reportedly been added to the console&#x27;s database. 


As spotted by reputable social media account PlayStation Game Size, which is known for sourcing this type of information, a PS5 version of the PlayStation 4 exclusive has been added to the backend of the PlayStation Network. 


While The Last of Us Part 2 was enhanced for PlayStation 5 back in 2021, it was not a native port. Rumours continue to swirl that such an edition is - perhaps - on the cards.

                              <span>A former Nintendo of Japan employee has publically spoken about his time working at the company, calling it a &quot;haven for superhumans and geniuses&quot;, but &quot;hell for an ordinary person&quot; like himself. 
Koichi Miura worked at Nintendo from 2019 to 2023 in game production and is now a freelance CG designer and YouTuber. On Twitter, he wrote about his experience at the company. It&#x27;s rare to see former employees openly talking in an industry which is known for a culture of keeping quiet. 
&quot;Nintendo was a great company,&quot; Miura wrote (as translated by Eurogamer), &quot;but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it lightly to others,&quot; he revealed, due to the sheer amount of talent within the company.

The game&#x27;s previous patch already made changes to increase the challenge of certain bosses. Now further tweaks have been made more broadly.


&quot;It was clear (both from your feedback and our internal findings) that many bosses simply weren&#x27;t posing enough of a challenge, so we have rebalanced some behaviours, as well as their hit points and damage output, to ensure they pose the correct level of difficulty at that point in your journey,&quot; read the patch notes on reddit from Hexworks.

                              <span>Embracer boss Lars Wingefors is staying tight-lipped on the current state of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. 


During a recent earnings presentation for the Swedish conglomerate, Wingefors was asked how he was feeling about the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. As a reminder, this remake was first announced back in 2021.


However, rather than providing an update on its fate, the CEO simply stated: &quot;I notice that anything I say to this becomes a headline, so that is my only comment.&quot;

On the PlayStation Direct store in the UK, the Portal costs £199.99 but is currently unavailable.

                              <span>Six month after its initial release, developer Arkane&#x27;s beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received a third major patch, this one primarily focusing on performance improvements and fixes, although it does add a tiny bit of new content in the form of a gun.


Specifically, Redfall players now have access to the Basilisk, an Unrivaled Sniper Rifle that can charge the first bullet in a full magazine with UV power to petrify Vampires. It can be found in locations where Unrivaled items spawn, but is most likely to drop from Bellwether-themed containers in the open-world or vampire nests.


Beyond the Basilisk, Redfall&#x27;s latest update brings bug fixes, balance improvements, and more - as detailed in its patch notes - touching on all aspects of the game, including AI and NPCs, gameplay and missions, heroes, UI, audio, and accessibility. Performance and stability is also a focus, with Arkane promising &quot;various performance fixes related to FPS drops and stuttering.&quot;

Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 will be entering the corporeal realm in the guise of a special Deluxe Edition containing a whole bunch of physical goodies. There&#x27;s the game itself, which comes on three discs for Xbox Series X/S, two discs for PS5, and a single DVD on PC - although that just contains a custom downloader app with an accompanying Steam key.


Moving onto the fancier physical stuff, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Deluxe Edition include three CDs containing the game&#x27;s original soundtrack, a double-sided map, two patches sporting Flaming Fist and Mark of the Absolute designs, a minder flayer poster, plus 32 stickers featuring the game&#x27;s origin characters, some iconic D&amp;D monsters and more.

                              <span>Thomas Waterzooi, developer of cosy painting-based puzzler Please, Touch the Artwork, has announced a sequel is in the works.


Known as Please, Touch the Artwork 2, this upcoming release will continue its predecessor&#x27;s &quot;tradition of immersing players in the captivating realm of a renowned modern artist&quot; as they help a skeleton painter &quot;find his way back home&quot;. 


Where the first game featured art by Piet Mondrian, the artist Waterzooi has focused on for this next release is James Ensor. Players will be able to look for hidden objects within Ensor&#x27;s works when the game releases &quot;early&quot; next year. We will update you with an exact date when we know more.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s remake trilogy will ultimately link up with Advent Children, making the film part of the remake canon.


Tetsuya Nomura, creative director for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, previously told The Guardian the games would link up to Advent Children. Now, speaking to Games Radar, producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed once again the link to Square Enix&#x27;s sequel film and discussed balancing the original story with new revisions.


&quot;We are finally going to link up with Advent Children, that is going to be part of canon,&quot; said Kitase. &quot;The overall storyline, the developments, will not go wildly out in a way that will not add up to Advent Children in the end. I don&#x27;t think anyone wanted that, that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re looking to create here.

Sony has introduced Star Ratings on the PS Store, meaning players can get an idea of how any given game has been received by fellow players before making a purchase. 


As you can see in the screenshots below, the likes of Robocop: Rogue City has a 4.53 star rating on the PlayStation Store. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, meanwhile, only has 2.59.

Visitors to G-Star 2023, an exhibition held in South Korea which runs from today to 19th November, are able to play a demo of the game. Krafton has uploaded gameplay footage from the demo for those who aren&#x27;t able to attend - you can watch it below.

As part of the studio&#x27;s interim report, Starbreeze called Payday 3&#x27;s launch a &quot;milestone&quot; for the company, adding that &quot;both interest in the game and initial sales exceeded [its] expectations&quot;. It then went on to address the reception Payday 3 has since received. 


As previously reported, the game was plagued with matchmaking issues at launch and online-only requirements. Meanwhile, its first promised &#x27;big&#x27; patch received several delays, before finally going live earlier this month.

                              <span>Sonic and Persona publisher Sega has been accused of threatening some of its unionised workers with layoffs, and is now facing an unfair labour practice complaint filed by the Communications Workers of America.
In a new report from Kotaku, on 6th November Sega of America is said to have brought union members into a meeting where they were told of a proposal to &quot;phase out&quot; all temporary employees by February 2024.
The union, Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS-CWA), has filed a complaint with the National Labour Relations Board in response, for making affected employees attend a mandatory meeting to deliver the news rather than bargain with the union as a whole. This could be a violation of the rule which states companies must not negotiate directly with unionised employees instead of with their union.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended Xbox Series X/S release has been delayed again.


Studio Wildcard&#x27;s souped-up version of its dinosaur survival game was meant to launch on Microsoft&#x27;s consoles earlier this week, having previously been expected in August. However, it was delayed at the final hour to an unspecified date, with the studio simply saying it would be released at some point &quot;this week&quot;. At this time, Studio Wildcard said it would update us with a release date before then. 


It has now issued an update but rather than saying &quot;hazaar, it is finally here&quot;, the studio has instead announced another delay. Again, the studio has not put an exact date on when Xbox Series X/S players can expect to see Ark: Survival Ascended arrive on consoles. It has simply said it is now &quot;targeting&quot; a release sometime early next week.

The company is in the midst of a &quot;comprehensive restructuring programme&quot; it announced in June to close studios and cut jobs, to transform the company into &quot;a leaner, stronger, more focused and cash self-sufficient company&quot;.



In the company&#x27;s latest financial report, Wingefors provided an update on restructuring progress, acknowledging the company&#x27;s &quot;first ever quarter-over-quarter reduction in headcount&quot;.

In addition, developer Ubisoft is also going to introduce an optional permadeath mode to the game. This new challenge will be available across all difficulty levels, the studio has said. 


Other than that, details are still quite thin on the ground. The Mirage team is yet to go into more about what either new mode will actually involve, but we do know that it will all be coming next month.

                              <span>Fortnite has added the ability to submit voice recordings when reporting players for violations of the game&#x27;s community rules, which cover instances of abusive or inappropriate behaviour.


Epic Games&#x27; voice reporting system works by recording the last five minutes of game chat audio on a rolling basis, saved to your local device (your PC or game console). Reports of inappropriate behaviour can now include that audio so Epic can hear evidence for itself and swiftly bring down the banhammer.


A detailed technical blog lays out how Epic has come up with a series of policies over when it stores any data you choose to upload, and when voice reporting will be enabled (you can switch it off, but only if you&#x27;re over 18 and playing in parties with friends with similar settings).

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was originally due to launch in 2022 but has been delayed twice since then, most recently following the game&#x27;s controversial gameplay debut, with Warner Bros. announcing it was pushing its release back to 2nd February 2024 in order to make it &quot;the best quality experience for players&quot;.


Eight months on, Suicide Squad has reemerged with a new Insider video series, its initial offering featuring 20 minutes of new gameplay  highlighting traversal mechanics, story elements, and a brief glimpse at the game&#x27;s rendition of Metropolis.

Monolith&#x27;s Wonder Woman was announced during 2021&#x27;s The Game Awards, where it was described a single-player open-world action game. As spotted by Wccftech, however, a recent advert seeking a &#x27;Lead Software Engineer, Gameplay&#x27; for the title on Monolith&#x27;s website has hinted that Warner Bros. may be looking to incorporate live service elements.


The ad, which talks of helping to &quot;deliver a superhero experience as epic as Wonder Woman herself&quot;, includes a list of daily duties associated with the job, alongside essential experience. The relevant part for this story, though, is listed under &quot;nice to haves&quot;, wherein Monolith indicates &quot;experience helping maintain a live software product or game&quot; will be beneficial.

                              <span>Xbox Series X/S owners eager for a Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 release date announcement will have a little longer to wait; developer Larian Studios has confirmed it&#x27;ll be sharing the news during this year&#x27;s Geoff-Keighley-hosted The Game Awards on 8th December.


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s journey to Xbox has, of course, been a bit of a bumpy one; Larian confirmed the acclaimed RPG would be coming Microsoft&#x27;s platform back February, amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive, but noted it had &quot;run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op.&quot;


The developer&#x27;s struggles implementing split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S have continued as the year has gone on, meaning Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 hit PC and PlayStation 5 in August with still no word of an Xbox release date. Eventually, though, after hashing things out with Xbox boss Phil Spencer, Larian confirmed a &quot;solution&quot; had been found: it would be dropping split-screen co-op for Series S until a later date to ensure the RPG hit Xbox before the end of the year.

Researchers from security firm GitGuardian this week reported finding almost 4,000 unique secrets stashed inside a total of 450,000 projects submitted to PyPI, the official code repository for the Python programming language. Nearly 3,000 projects contained at least one unique secret. Many secrets were leaked more than once, bringing the total number of exposed secrets to almost 57,000...</span>

                              <span>This is interesting:
For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that a large portion of cryptographic keys used to protect data in computer-to-server SSH traffic are vulnerable to complete compromise when naturally occurring computational errors occur while the connection is being established.
[…]
The vulnerability occurs when there are errors during the signature generation that takes place when a client and server are establishing a connection. It affects only keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm, which the researchers found in roughly a third of the SSH signatures they examined. That translates to roughly 1 billion signatures out of the 3.2 billion signatures examined. Of the roughly 1 billion RSA signatures, about one in a million exposed the private key of the host...</span>

As with every release, Kubernetes v1.29 will introduce feature deprecations and removals. Our continued ability to produce high-quality releases is a testament to our robust development cycle and healthy community. The following are some of the deprecations and removals coming in the Kubernetes 1.29 release.
The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it w…</span>

There’s been quite a lot of posts suggesting that not using Kubernetes resource limits might be a fairly useful thing (for example, For the Love of God, Stop Using CPU Limits on Kubernetes or Kubernetes: Make your services faster by removing CPU limits ). The points made there are totally valid – it doesn’t make much sense to pay for compute power that will not be used due to limits, nor to artificially increase latency. This post strives to argue that limits have their legitimate use as well.
As a Site Reliability Engineer on the Grafana Labs platform team, which maintains and improves internal infrastructure and tooling used by the product teams, I primarily try to make Kubernetes upgrades as smooth as possible. But I also spend a lot of time going down…</span>

Hamilton joins a steadily growing number of noted sports stars and celebrities to be turned into Fortnite skins as part of the Icons series, including Naomi Osaka, Chloe Kim, LeBron James, Neymar Jr., Ariana Grande, Bruno Mars, and Marshmello.


News of Hamilton&#x27;s imminent Fortnite debut was accompanied by a trailer featuring the F1 star wandering around (for some reason) a hall of mirrors then launching himself at a vaguely cat-like superhero outfit before plunging into the world of Fortnite - whereupon the outfit had magically wrapped itself around Hamilton&#x27;s digital frame.

                              <span>If you have played through Alan Wake 2, you will by no doubt be well aware of its musical number. In fact, even if you haven&#x27;t played it, you may also be aware of this particular moment. It has become quite popular online.


Before I go further though, if you have no idea what I am talking about and want to keep as much of Alan Wake 2 a surprise, please head elsewhere now. I do not want to spoil this moment for you. 


OK, so, for those of you who are still with me, I am of course talking about Herald of Darkness by Old Gods of Asgard (AKA Poets of the Fall). It is an absolute tune, and honestly, for me, this song is the best part of Alan Wake 2 (so far at least, I am still not quite finished).

                              <span>The Witcher 3 team has announced a PC mod editor is in the works for Wild Hunt. 


According to the official Witcher social media account, this editor will allow users to create their own experiences in the game &quot;by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content&quot;. 


The team said the mod editor will release some time next year, but did not state any timeframe. It did, however, say when it does release it will be free.

                              <span>Starfield released a little over two months ago on PC and Xbox. However, despite a strong start which saw Starfield become the &quot;biggest Bethesda game launch&quot; of all time, things have tailed off a bit now. In fact, there are currently more people playing Bethesda&#x27;s earlier RPG, Skyrim, over on Steam. 


At the time of writing, there are currently 1610 Steam users playing through 2011&#x27;s Skyrim release, and 13,776 playing 2016&#x27;s Special Edition release. That makes a total of 15,386 Skyrimmers at the present time. 


Both releases combined have a 24-hour player peak of 25,181. If we pop in the VR players as well, that number is higher still.

However, a further list of issues remain under investigation. Further, no widespread frame-rate improvements have been made - a major sticking point of the collection for fans.

The Sky Breaker is scheduled for release in summer 2024, with Secrets of the Spires following in the autumn. Here&#x27;s what Ubisoft has to say about those: &quot;Face a mysterious shadow in The Sky Breaker story pack and engage in epic aerial battles as you discover the secret of the new canyon region in the Secrets of the Spires story pack.&quot;

                              <span>The new Turok 3 remaster has slipped out earlier than planned in Europe and Australia, following confusion over the game&#x27;s recently-delayed launch date. 


For fans here in Europe, this means the game is available now but contains bugs and lacks quality-of-life improvements which developer Nightdive Studios had intended to remedy in the version of the game set to officially launch elsewhere in two weeks&#x27; time.


For fans elsewhere, such as in the US and Canada, Turok 3 is still due to launch on 30th November with those final tweaks included.

The game will now be a little easier in the early stages, thanks to adjusted attack speed of some monsters in the field and increased stance break duration, more Quartz available earlier on, and the Rising Dodge now a default ability.


Further, balance adjustments have been made to combat, with some weapons now dealing increased damage, plus lighter blades gaining more Guard Regain and heavier blades gaining less.

                              <span>Kaitlyn Dever is reportedly in talks to star as Abby in the second season of The Last of Us. 


That&#x27;s according to a new report by journalist and critic Jeff Sneider, who is known for their film and TV industry scoops. 


Sources familiar with the project said Dever was poised to land the role of Abby thanks to her performance in No One Will Save You, an alien invasion movie which premiered on Hulu back in September. However, she is perhaps better known for role as Amy Antsler in Booksmart.

That&#x27;s according to Ryu Ga Gotoku studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama, who discussed the forthcoming game&#x27;s length in an interview with Japanese website Game Watch (translated by Automaton Media).


&quot;If you go at it continuously, you&#x27;ll get sick, and it won&#x27;t end with just one or two all-nighters,&quot; said Yokoyama of Infinite Wealth.

                              <span>Video games publisher Humble Games has announced layoffs at the company. 


Humble staff members first discussed the layoffs via social media yesterday, as they began looking for new jobs. It&#x27;s still unconfirmed how many people are affected.


In a statement to Videogames.si, which first reported the layoffs, Humble confirmed it had said &quot;goodbye to valued coleagues&quot; and blamed the job losses on industry &quot;trends&quot;.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended - Studio Wildcard&#x27;s controversial Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up of its dinosaur-themed survival game - will no longer launch for Xbox Series X/S on 15th November as originally announced, with the developer now hoping to release the game &quot;later this week&quot;.


Ark: Survival Ascended is no stranger to delays, of course; the full-price upgrade - which is mandatory for players wishing to continue using Wildcard&#x27;s official servers - was originally due to launch in August but was delayed to October after Wildcard admitted it &quot;found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2&quot;.


October did eventually see the release of Ark: Survival Ascended on PC (albeit with a heap of performance problems), but its arrival was accompanied by a further delay for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, with both versions being pushed back to an unspecified point in &quot;November&quot;. Wildcard finally slapped the Xbox version with a 15th November release date last week (the PS5 edition remains TBA), but that&#x27;s now slipped again too.

As per its own recent figures, Digital Bros currently employs 442 people across the company, meaning its newly announced layoffs will likely impact around 130 workers.


The company says it&#x27;s making the cuts after reviewing projects across its development studios and publishing units - which include 505, Assetto Corsa developer Kunos Simulazioni, Puzzle Quest studio Infinity Plus Two, and Terraria mobile developer DR Studios - in order to &quot;align with the evolving competitive environment [and] ensure maximum operational efficiency.&quot;

                              <span>Netflix has confirmed its new stop-motion Pokémon series, Pokémon Concierge, will release on 28th December this year - and there&#x27;s a fresh two-minute trailer to accompanying the news.


Pokémon Concierge, which was announced at the Pokémon Presents showcase back in February, follows the adventures of Haru, a new concierge at a southern island hotel resort for Pokémon. According to Netflix&#x27;s brief blurb for the show, Haru &quot;gradually discovers herself as she and her fellow staff members scramble to attend to the various Pokémon guests.&quot;


&quot;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all [felt like] we are bombarded, under pressure, or that we don&#x27;t want to get up and keep doing what we&#x27;ve been doing and just give up,&quot; Haru&#x27;s voice actor Rena Nōnen said of Pokémon Concierge back in July, &quot;But when you see [the show], it&#x27;s really therapeutic and it makes you want to try and be the best you can be.&quot;

                              <span>If it&#x27;s indies you want, you&#x27;re in luck (as long as you&#x27;re specifically wanting them on Switch); Nintendo has aired another instalment of its Indie World showcase, this time bringing news of a canceled Shantae revival, plague-themed turn-based tactics, a launch date for developer Inkle&#x27;s gorgeous hiking adventure A Highland Song, news of Outer Wilds&#x27; long-awaited Switch release, and more. If you&#x27;re looking to catch up on the excitement, or simply need a reminder, you&#x27;ll find a full breakdown of everything featured during the show below.


Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution sees developer WayForward reviving the cancelled Game Boy Advance instalment of its acclaimed platform series nearly two decades on. To progress through its challenges, players will need to take advantage of Shantae&#x27;s animal transformation abilities, as well as her newfoud power to rearrange stages by switching the foreground and background, and it&#x27;ll also feature a 4-player local battle mode when it launches next year.


Developer Pugstorm&#x27;s Core Keeper is a &quot;mining sandbox adventure&quot; for up to eight players set in an &quot;endless&quot; procedurally generated cave system. There&#x27;s an ancient mystery to be solved, but doing so requires players to hone their survival skills by mining for relics and resources, building bases, growing crops, and hatching pets, as they push further into the subtarrenean world and take on its monsters. This one&#x27;s due to release for Switch in summer 2024.

                              <span>A Highland Song, the beautiful &quot;open platforming&quot; adventure from Heaven&#x27;s Vault and 80 Days developer Inkle, is almost here and will be launching for Switch and PC on 5th December.


A Highland Song tells the story of teenager Moira McKinnon who one day decides to run away from her life of relative seclusion in a small house on the edge of the Scottish Highlands, after recieving a letter from her Uncle Hamish, inviting her to his lighthouse on the coast.


What follows is yet another genre shift for the ever-ambitious Inkle. This time, the acclaimed studio - which has previously dabbled in the likes of visual novels, turn-based strategy, exploratory adventuring, and murder mystery - is combining its acclaimed narrative expertise with 2.5D platforming, as Moira sets off on a journey across the Highlands, where &quot;every peak has a story to tell and every valley echoes with song.&quot;

                              <span>Satisfactory developer Coffee Stain Studios has released a new update for the Early Access game which upgrades it to Unreal Engine 5.


Players have been able to try out this version of the factory-building sim for some time in an Experimental branch, allowing the developers to fine tune performance improvements. Now it&#x27;s available for all on both Steam and the Epic Games Store.


The upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 allows for a more stable foundation for future features, Coffee Stain has said, as well as a new lighting system, vehicle and sound overhauls, and additional granular keybind options.

                              <span>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle, which also includes three months of Nintendo Switch Online. 


It&#x27;s set to launch next Monday 20th November - just in time for Black Friday - priced €349 at select retailers or direct from Nintendo via the My Nintendo Store. 


A Nintendo Switch bundle featuring Mario Kart 8 has become something of a Black Friday staple - though previous years have featured a regular launch model Switch rather than the improved OLED upgrade.

The update, which is scheduled for later this month, will include two &#x27;Legacy Heists&#x27; from Payday 2.


The heists in question are Cook off and Turbid Station. Starbreeze says their arrival will allow players to &quot;relive the thrill and excitement&quot; of the previous game&#x27;s heists, but with a slight reimagining and improved gameplay.

                              <span>A familiar Modern Warfare 3 skin is once again playing havoc in the game&#x27;s multiplayer modes,  prompting complaints from players.

Modern Warfare 3 allows players to transfer a &quot;vast amount&quot; of their previously acquired Modern Warfare 2 content over to this year&#x27;s Call of Duty release - including the controversial Gaia operator skin, which could be acquired as part of Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s Blackcell Battle Pass bundles. This has been dubbed the Groot skin within the community given its likeness to Marvel&#x27;s sentient tree-like creature. 


The Gaia skin is described by Activision as an &quot;ancient goddess of considerable power, [that] uses her earthen form to inspire ruin in her enemies&quot;. As you can see from the header image above, it is incredibly dark and see-through in places, making it almost indistinguishable from many of the surroundings in Modern Warfare&#x27;s multiplayer maps (both 2 and 3).

To recap, here&#x27;s what&#x27;s joining Game Pass for the rest of the month:
As always, the arrival of these new games means that others will be leaving Game Pass soon. All of the following will no longer be available after 30th November:

                              <span>Lara Croft is coming to Magic: The Gathering as part of an upcoming Secret Lair x Tomb Raider collaboration. 


This collaboration will see six cards and a new treasure token making their way to the trading card game. Five of these cards are familiar Magic cards which have been re-imagined with artwork from the Tomb Raider games.


The cards themselves feature scenes from across the series, with the likes of Rise of the Tomb Raider&#x27;s Kitezh and the original/Anniversary game&#x27;s Lost Valley making a showing. There is also an equipment card for Totec&#x27;s Spear (from Guardian of Light), while Lara&#x27;s bow features as The Grim Whisperer.

Last night, The Game Awards revealed its nominees for the upcoming event, which is set to take place on Thursday 7th December. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 received multiple nominations this year, including Game of the Year, Best Game Direction and Best Narrative.


 Sharing its delight, Larian said it was &quot;extremely proud&quot; to see its game nominated across the various categories. It then closed with a little tease: &quot;Xbox fans, and fans of physical media, watch this space for a formal announcement. It&#x27;s going to be a busy week.&quot;

Official mod support and mod tools will be added to the game as an all-in-one Editor, which publisher Paradox previously confirmed wouldn&#x27;t be present at launch. 
In the latest developer diary from Colossal Order, CEO Mariina Hallikainen said the studio expected to need at least a couple more months to get the Editor &quot;in a shape where we can release it&quot;.

&quot;We&#x27;ve listened to our customers and we know delivering free games every month is what they want most, so we are refining our Prime benefit to increase our focus there,&quot; wrote Christoph Hartmann, VP of Amazon Games in an internal email shared with Aftermath.

The game will be published by Tencent, but &quot;due to uncertainties in creating a successful game to the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks&quot;, both companies have &quot;discussed a new direction&quot; for the project.


It&#x27;s got a new codename too: Kestrel.

                              <span>Xbox has announced a competition in collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures to promote the upcoming film Wonka which will see one lucky person win a range of chocolate goodies including a Wonka-inspired Xbox Series X and an edible controller.
The winner will also receive a regular black Xbox wireless controller, as the chocolate controller presumably can&#x27;t be used with the console. 
This is the first-ever &quot;official edible&quot; Xbox controller, the company notes, which begs the question - who is making unofficial edible Xbox controllers and out of what? Chocolate would be my last choice. Surely it&#x27;ll melt really quickly in your hands?

The disc drive was shown in action by YouTuber Mystic in a PS5 slim unboxing video, in which he walked through the process of pairing the drive with a console. 
The disc drive will easily pair to a console, even if it&#x27;s already registered to a different one and the console has its own disc drive registered.

A post on X, formerly Twitter, from Nintendo this afternoon stated that tomorrow&#x27;s broadcast would last 20 minutes, and feature &quot;new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch&quot;.

                              <span>A Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 player has laid down the Bear% gauntlet with a sex speedrun of under an hour.


The speedrunner, Weedmoder, currently holds the world record time of 50 minutes and 30 seconds and shared a video of the run online (thanks VG247).



Of course, the speedrun involves banging the bear, aka druid Halsin. That means completing his romance questline, which cannot be done until Act 3.

                              <span>A recently-published Sony patent application shows the company has been further researching a way to allow players to replay a game from specific points while streaming and experience its storyline again.

Titled Content Streaming With Gameplay Launch, the patent was filed on 11th July 2023 and publically published on 2nd November via WIPO (spotted by Exputer).

It describes a game which contains multiple &quot;trigger points of media content&quot;. These are moments which the player could start a replay from, which would be provided &quot;by the platform, publisher, or third-party publisher&quot;. These trigger points are described as the start of an &quot;activity&quot; such as a boss battle or quest, or when a player levels up.

Reina is the 32nd and final fighter to join the upcoming release&#x27;s roster, but, as is always the case, last is certainly not the least. Her character promises lightning fast moves, and a mysterious interest in Jin. Why does she want to fight him so badly? We will have to wait to find out.


You can watch Reina&#x27;s Tekken 8 introduction trailer below.

Quarry, Rundown and Scrapyard were removed from the game&#x27;s Hardpoint playlists last Thursday, 9th November, after players complained. In a post on its bug-tracking social media account, Activision acknowledged &quot;an issue causing unfavourable spawns&quot;. 


Karachi was next to go last Friday, 10th November - binned from Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s Cutthroat playlist while Activision, it said, worked to &quot;resolve an issue causing a player to spawn alongside enemies&quot;.

&quot;It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I&#x27;m sincerely grateful,&quot; said the player on reddit. &quot;This marks the end of a chapter but I just wanted to say, thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the players that summoned me.&quot;

                              <span>PlayStation 5 accounted for 51 percent of all console sales in the UK over the past six months.


Sony&#x27;s latest console held a 43 percent share on all console sales between November 2022 and October 2023, according to UK chart firm GfK (via Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz).  But hone in on the last six months and the PS5&#x27;s sales account for just over 50 percent of all console purchases since May.


GfK games boss Dorian Bloch said these figures are a result of various price promotions held over the summer months, the console&#x27;s recent EA Sports FC bundle and, of course, &quot;unrestricted sales&quot; on the standard PlayStation 5 model. Unlike previous years, there are currently no supply and stock shortages for Sony&#x27;s PS5 console here in the UK.

That&#x27;s according to UK sales figures shared by numbers company GFK (via GamesIndustry.biz). 80 percent of boxed sales were on PlayStation, with 20 percent on Xbox.


The new Modern Warfare 3 marks the first time Activision Blizzard has double dipped on the same Call of Duty sub-brand two years running to immediately release a direct sequel to the previous year&#x27;s game. But controversy has swirled around the game&#x27;s development and release.

                              <span>Ironmace is continuing to capitalise on the success of Dark and Darker by issuing another &quot;collector&#x27;s box&quot; of coffee inspired by the game.

The &quot;Pourin One Out&quot; Collector&#x27;s Box is available to pre-order now and includes one tub of dark chocolate cinnamon churro cold brew coffee, one 12oz bag of dark chocolate cinnamon flavoured whole beat coffee, a 500ml stainless steel shaker cup, and the &quot;Pourin One Out&quot; in-game emote.  

&quot;Out of the darkness comes our second collaboration with Dark and Darker - the &#x27;Pourin One Out&#x27; Limited Edition Collector&#x27;s Box!&quot; says partner Madrinas. &quot;This box features a Dark Chocolate Cinnamon Churro Cold Brew and a Darker Chocolate Cinnamon Whole Bean Coffee.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players have discovered a strange bug that essentially traps players against an invisible wall, stopping them from moving and leaving them exposed to competitors.

The issue – which has been around for some time now – chiefly affects players on the Colosseo map, and sees players get trapped. Without the help of characters like Lifeweaver of Mei&#x27;s movement abilities to bump them out of position, they&#x27;ll stay trapped, too.

Despite many players reporting they&#x27;ve also been stuck in this exact spot as a myriad of different players, it doesn&#x27;t look like Blizzard&#x27;s yet been able to address the problem.

It&#x27;s left fans wondering how NetherRealm will implement Homelander, and who will be the voice behind the character when he joins as a guest fighter next year.

&quot;My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined,&quot; lamented one unhappy fan in a comment that has been upvoted hundreds of times.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence will change so many aspects of society, largely in ways that we cannot conceive of yet. Democracy, and the systems of governance that surround it, will be no exception. In this short essay, I want to move beyond the “AI-generated disinformation” trope and speculate on some of the ways AI will change how democracy functions—in both large and small ways.
When I survey how artificial intelligence might upend different aspects of modern society, democracy included, I look at four different dimensions of change: speed, scale, scope, and sophistication. Look for places where changes in degree result in changes of kind. Those are where the societal upheavals will happen...</span>

                              <span>Sledgehammer Games has hit back at reports about the development cycle of Modern Warfare 3, insisting it is &quot;incredibly proud&quot; of the latest Call of Duty instalment and says that its &quot;proud to be the team to lead the way on Modern Warfare 3&quot;, and &quot;anything said to the contrary is simply not true&quot;.

The statement comes days after Bloomberg broke the news that employees needed to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period.

&quot;We’re incredibly proud of Modern Warfare 3 – both the full game experience at launch and the upcoming year of content we have planned for the community,&quot; said Sledgehammer&#x27;s studio head, Aaron Halon.

                              <span>We already knew that the original director for Super Mario RPG on the SNES, Chihiro Fujioka, wasn&#x27;t returning for the forthcoming Switch remake, but now we know which development studio did lead development: ArtePiazza.

As spotted by Naruki on X/Twitter, players who&#x27;ve already pre-ordered the remake from the eShop have discovered that ArtePiazza - perhaps best known for its work on Square Enix&#x27;s Dragon Quest series - has taken the reigns, with Nintendo&#x27;s Ayako Moriwaki stepping into the director role.

That said, some of the inaugural developers who worked on the 1996 original have also been credited in the game, including co-director Yoshihiko Maekawa, composer Yoko Shimomura, and designer Taro Kudo.

                              <span>Netflix has revealed Doug Cockle - the gravelly voice of Geralt of Rivia in CD Projekt&#x27;s The Witcher series - will be reprising his role as the silver-haired monster-bopper in a new animated movie coming to the streaming service &quot;late&quot; next year.


The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, as the film is officially titled, begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. However, as answers are slowly revealed, Geralt finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.


&quot;He must count on friends — old and new,&quot; Netflix teases in its announcement, &quot;to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting Nightdive Studios&#x27; Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion remaster, you&#x27;ll need to hang in there just a bit longer; the developer is delaying its release by a few weeks, with the dino FPS now coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 30th November.


Nightdive&#x27;s remastering of the original Turok trilogy - which was developed by the now-defunct Iguana Entertainment - has been quite the undertaking; the studio released its Turok 1 remaster eight years ago, back in 2015, and its sequel got the spruce-up treatment two years later. 


Nightdive&#x27;s Turok 3 remaster - which will mark the first time the game has been available since its N64 debut in 2000 - promises to be similarly thorough, introducing enhanced environment art and character models, updated weapon models, plus &quot;advanced rendering features&quot; that&#x27;ll include anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has attempted to placate angry Mortal Kombat 1 players with two &#x27;free&#x27; Fatalities following an outcry caused by the decision to introduce a $10 USD Fatality animation to the game&#x27;s already heavily criticised premium store.


Despite being sold as a full-price title costing £59.99/$69.99 USD, the latest entry in developer NetherRealm&#x27;s long-running fighting series features a rotational in-game shop selling store-exclusive cosmetics - including costumes and gear - only available to purchase with real-world money (in contrast, Mortal Kombat 11 also enabled players to buy cosmetics, but these could largely also be earned by completing activities in-game).


While Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s premium store has already drawn plenty of ire from players, things came to a head last month when Warner Bros. and developer NetherRealm began selling a store-exclusive Halloween Fatality animation for $10. To put that in some kind of perspective, $20 would get you several DLC characters in Mortal Kombat 11.

                              <span>Whatever you might think of Call of Duty, you can&#x27;t accuse its anti-cheat team of lacking imagination; having previously caused chaos for multiplayer cheaters by whisking away their weapons and turning opponents invisible, it&#x27;ll soon be cutting their parachute cords and causing their bunny hops to launch them 10,000ft into the air before a very messy end.


This latest bit of mischief is the work of the team behind Call of Duty&#x27;s server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, officially known as Ricochet, which outlined its latest steps in the war against online ne&#x27;er-do-wells - particularly the role Machine Learning plays in improving its anti-cheat systems - in a timely blog post coinciding with today&#x27;s launch of Modern Warfare 3.


&quot;Combining everything [we have] developed over the course of the last two years with new Machine Learning advancements,&quot; it wrote, &quot;Richochet: Anti-Cheat is preparing for the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 with a stronger and faster process to combat cheating.&quot;

                              <span>Mass Effect fans have been debating a recent claim that the next game in the series may not launch until 2029.


This week, Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb suggested Mass Effect 5 would not arrive until near the end of the decade, based on insider knowledge and some back of the envelope maths based on the ongoing and protracted development of Dragon Age Dreadwolf.


Grubb&#x27;s comments were predictably pounced upon by fans following a somewhat mixed response to this year&#x27;s annual Mass Effect franchise celebrations on 7th November - N7 Day.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto has admitted Nintendo faces &quot;an extremely high hurdle&quot; not to disappoint fans across the world with the forthcoming film.


Following the company&#x27;s latest earnings report, Miyamoto and CEO Shuntaro Furukawa were asked about the risks of expanding IPs beyond video games, to which Miyamoto responded directly on the Zelda live-action film that was announced during the report.



&quot;Regarding the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, I know we face an extremely high hurdle in producing a film that will not disappoint the global fan base,&quot; he said. &quot;With this challenge in mind, I have been discussing this project with Avi Arad, Chairman of Arad Productions Inc., for about 10 years.&quot;

                              <span>Twitch is removing its controversial Hype Chat feature, based on &quot;community feedback&quot;.

Hype Chat was a feature launched in June that allowed viewers to pay to have messages pinned at the top of a streamer&#x27;s chat window.



Now, just five months later, it&#x27;s being deprecated from 15th November and instead Twitch will invest more into Cheering and Bits.

This is thanks to a new partnership between Paramount and Microsoft. It means those of us here in Blighty will be able to watch the TV version of Halo (via an app and with a Paramount Plus subscription) on the same platform we play the video game version of Halo. 


You can see a trailer for Halo&#x27;s first season below.

                              <span>Activision has claimed its Call of Duty HQ launcher provides easier file management and seamless switching between games, despite criticism from players.


Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, the latest in the series, now launches from Call of Duty HQ alongside last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2. Activision describes the launcher as &quot;the front door for Call of Duty&quot; and states &quot;players have control over the footprint of their Call of Duty experience on their platform of choice, and it&#x27;s all contained within one unified location&quot;.


In practice, however, it&#x27;s confusing plenty of players and has resulted in huge file sizes - as previously reported, the install size of the complete package is over 200GB on some platforms.

Larian&#x27;s own Swen Vincke recently shared a rather welcome update with his followers over on X (formerly Twitter). In a new post, the CEO shared two graphs showing how RAM and VRAM loads for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Series S port have been reduced in recent weeks. 

&quot;Got a nice present from our engineers. Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back. I think this will benefit all platforms too,&quot; he wrote to accompany the two graphs (which you can see via the embed below).

Back at BlizzCon last week, The War Within expansion was revealed along with two further expansions to begin the multi-part Worldsoul Saga. However, the Epic edition (costing $89.99) includes guaranteed beta access and three days of early access, the first time Warcraft has offered this.


Fans have responded angrily, as per this reddit thread, but Hazzikostas said the studio is following a trend.

                              <span>A new report claims Modern Warfare 3 was developed in just 16 months. That&#x27;s roughly half the time of a standard Call of Duty release. 


More than a dozen employees at developer Sledgehammer shared their experiences working on the Modern Warfare 2 sequel with Bloomberg - in particular the need to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period. 


Meanwhile, sources said that Modern Warfare 3 initially started out as an expansion to last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 - something that was previously suggested. This expansion, which was codenamed Jupiter, was reportedly going to be set solely in Mexico, rather than a globe spanning release the Call of Duty series is typically known for.

                              <span>Unity is &quot;likely&quot; to announce layoffs as part of broader cost cutting measures.


As noted in the company&#x27;s Q3 earnings report, Unity is assessing its product portfolio &quot;to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers&quot; and is &quot;evaluating the right cost structure that aligns with the more focused portfolio&quot;.


Changes will be completed before the end of Q1 in 2024, which will &quot;likely include discontinuing certain product offerings, reducing our workforce, and reducing our office footprint&quot; (thanks The Verge).

                              <span>It&#x27;s been just over two years since acclaimed animated League of Legends spin-off Arcane launched on Netflix, but finally its long-awaited second season has the closest thing to a release date yet. The bad news is there&#x27;s still a long wait in store; the streaming service has now confirmed Arcane season two will launch in November 2024.


The first season of Arcane told the story of sisters Jinx and Vi - two of League of Legends most popular champions - as they find themselves caught on different sides of a conflict between the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun, which hits boiling point after the invention of Hextech technology.


Hailee Steinfeld and Ella Purnell will reprise their roles as Vi and Jinx in Arcane&#x27;s upcoming second season - which fans have been waiting for since it was confirmed to be happening shortly after the release of season one - with Katie Leung also set to return as Caitlyn Kiramman.

                              <span>Warframe developer Digital Extremes has confirmed a &quot;number of&quot; layoffs at the studio resulting from the closure of its publishing division. It&#x27;s also announced it&#x27;ll no longer be publishing free-to-play online action-RPG Wayfinder following the closure, and that full control of the property will return to developer Airship Syndicate.


In a statement provided to Eurogamer after news of layoffs at the studio was broken via PC Gamer, Digital Extremes wrote, &quot;We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division.&quot;


&quot;We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result,&quot; the statement continued, &quot;and we&#x27;re working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in the coming months.&quot;

                              <span>Remnant 2&#x27;s first expansion, The Awakened King, is right around the corner, and ahead of its release next Tuesday, 14th November, developer Gunfire Games has revealed a second copy of the DLC won&#x27;t be required to play it with a friend.


The Awakened King, to provide a bit of context, introduces a new storyline focusing on the Root-corrupted (and decidedly peeved) One True King. It&#x27;ll see players attempting to uncover his secrets by exploring the seaside town of the Forlorn Coast, a new area of Losomn containing dungeons and &quot;unexpected allies&quot;. It also adds news weapons and equipment, new enemies and bosses, plus the new Ritualist archetype.


It sounds like a good solid chunk of stuff for Remnant 2 fans to get stuck into, then, and Gunfire Games has now confirmed over on social media that players won&#x27;t need to own a copy of The Awakened King themselves in order to play through its storyline and visit its new location with a friend that&#x27;s already made a purchase.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been over three years since developer Jonathan Blow announced his critically acclaimed, time-manipulating platform-puzzler Braid was getting an Anniversary Edition, but, finally, a release is in sight; it&#x27;s coming to Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Netflix mobile on April 30th, 2024.


Given that Braid initially launched for Xbox 360 all the way back in August 2008, its Anniversary Edition will be arriving squarely within its 15th birthday year, and a significant amount of work has been done on the original release to celebrate that milestone.


For starters, Braid&#x27;s gorgeous visuals have been &quot;hand-repainted&quot; by original artist David Hellman. Today&#x27;s press release doesn&#x27;t elaborate on that much, but when the Anniversary Edition was announced in 2020, Blow said his Thekla Inc. studio was working on enhanced foregrounds and backgrounds, increased level of detail in certain areas, plus extra animations and effects to improve the feel of movement.

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Deck OLED, a revamped version of its popular handheld PC which boasts - as you might guess - a shiny new OLED screen as its star feature.


Steam Deck OLED retains the existing size and main technical specs of the current Steam Deck (so all current Steam Deck verified games will run the same on OLED models), but includes an improved display that&#x27;s bigger and uses HDR.


The new OLED models go on sale next week, on 16th November at 6pm UK time priced at $549 for a 512GB model or $649 for a 1TB model. (There&#x27;s also a lower $399 price right now for the 256GB current LCD model, which is sticking around as an entry-price alternative.)

                              <span>Don&#x27;t expect Steam Deck 2.0 anytime soon, Valve has said, as the technology to launch a handheld with an adequately beefy jump in power just doesn&#x27;t yet exist.


Speaking to Eurogamer ahead of today&#x27;s Steam Deck OLED announcement, Valve engineers discussed the features it is adding to its shinier new handheld model that were not possible to provide back when the original Steam Deck debuted. 


The company also said it was working on game projects - plural - right now which were still targeting current Steam Deck hardware performance levels (which remain unchanged in the OLED).

                              <span>As we stroll gamely into month two of Sea of Thieves&#x27; extremely long-delayed Season 10, Rare has announced that the second of its three big tentpole features - the new PvP-focused Skull of the Siren Song voyage - will arrive next Thursday, 16th November.


The Skull of the Siren Song provides a more action-orientated addition to Rare&#x27;s piratical multiplayer adventure following the introduction of Guilds last month, essentially unfolding as an opt-in server-wide race to find the titular jewel-encrusted treasure.


Crews can opt-in to the new voyage whenever a ghostly note randomly appears on their ship&#x27;s mast during play. Once a sufficient number of teams are signed up, Captain Briggsy appears to hand them all two maps maps - one pointing to a chest containing the fabled skull, the other to the key required to open it - whereupon a messy dash to retrieve them both is likely to ensue. But there&#x27;s a little more mischief once the cursed skull has been found: any ship that houses it will significantly slow down, meaning it&#x27;s likely to change hands a number of times before one dedicated crew manages to cash it in at an outpost.

That&#x27;s according to a Korean forum for the forthcoming game, which claims producer Yoshinori Kitase mentioned in an interview a certain segment of the Rebirth trailer was actually taken from this CG sequence, which will be available to view at any time.


Final Fantasy streamer Aitai Kimochi shared the news on X, formerly Twitter, but noted the Korean forum doesn&#x27;t list an exact source for the interview.

This roadmap extends from November through to January, kicking off today - 9th November - with a new Challenge Pack known as Cloud Nine. 


Players will be able to unlock the Sunset Rubber Duck, Orange Pinstripe Briefcase and White Sunset Suit by travelling to Whittleton Creek, Hokkaido and Ambrose Island to complete the Cloud Nine Challenges. Once that is all done and dusted, they will be rewarded with these new items.

                              <span>Strauss Zelnick, boss of GTA publisher Take-Two, has credited the company&#x27;s &quot;three-part strategy&quot; as the reason it has managed to avoid mass layoffs this year.


As we have reported numerous times over the past several months, the video game industry has seen layoffs after layoffs this year. This has resulted in studios being closed, such as Saints Row developer Volition. Others, such as Epic, have seen their numbers significantly reduced. 


According to Zelnick, Take-Two has managed to avoid such consequences thanks to moderate investments and a focus on efficiency over recent years.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto 6 could contain generative AI, according to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick.
Speaking at the Paley International Council Summit on 7th November, Zelnick highlighted AI&#x27;s potential in game development, specifically for NPCs (as reported by Inverse).
Interactions between players and NPCs are normally scripted, which Zelnick described as &quot;generally not very interesting&quot;. Using AI to generate dialogue trees and add variety could make the interactions &quot;really interesting and fun&quot;, he stated.

                              <span>Broken Roads, the upcoming narrative-driven cRPG from developer Drop Bear Bytes, has been delayed.


The game was set to release in just a few days time, on 14th November. However, the developer has now announced it has delayed the game at the last minute to &quot;allow for additional polish time&quot;. More work is needed to make sure Broken Roads isn&#x27;t broken on release, essentially, with the help of more QA testing.


In a post on Steam, the Broken Roads team stated the game was &quot;content complete&quot; but &quot;coming in longer&quot; than originally expected. The developer said its roughly 30 hours of gameplay and vast dialogue had made it &quot;extremely time-consuming to properly test&quot; all of the game&#x27;s content.

That&#x27;s according to its latest financial earnings report, where hardware sales for the last quarter were 4.9m - a Q2 record for a PlayStation console. As previously reported in August, Sony had then sold 41.7m units.


Sony stated these sales were in-line with expectations and a 25 percent increase on PS4 units sold in the equivalent period (Q2 FY17). Further, the 4.9m PS5 consoles sold in Q2 is a 48 percent increase compared to last year, likely owing to increased stock.

In a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, Toufexis said both he and Jones &quot;worked for months&quot; providing dialogue for the main player character. 


But, as we all know to be the case, Bethesda ultimately decided Starfield&#x27;s protagonist should remain silent.

Gaiden has already broken the series&#x27; concurrent peak player count on Steam, as recorded by SteamDB,  with 9743 players jumping in on launch day.

But in the years since, Star Wars: Hunters has been repeatedly delayed, with an original 2021 launch window turning into 2022, then 2023, and now - as of last night - 2024.


In a statement issued to X, formerly Twitter, last night, Zynga said it had made the &quot;difficult decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters to 2024&quot;, without providing any more concrete launch details.

Back in February 2022, Sony stated it aimed to launch over 10 new live service games. The news came days after it acquired Destiny developer Bungie



Now, however, it seems plans are being scaled back to ensure each live service game&#x27;s quality, as Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki explained on a call discussing the company&#x27;s latest financial results (thanks VGC).

                              <span>Unannounced football game Lego 2K Goooal! has leaked yet again, this time with official artwork via a listing on the PlayStation Store. 


It&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve got an impression of how the game will look, with fantasy Lego characters such as a knight and a pirate with a peg-leg, and what looks like a dragon flying through the sky.


The artwork was spotted on the PlayStation Store and shared on social media by industry analyst MauroNL, who noted that the product&#x27;s page had since been deleted.

                              <span>Tired of having to explain yourself every time your friends catch you firing up Hosiery Party: Wet Potato Frenzy on Steam? Well, there&#x27;s some good news: Valve is reportedly readying a feature that&#x27;ll let you mark specific games as &quot;private&quot; so you can hide your more unusual tastes from other users while still maintaining a public profile.


At present, Steam&#x27;s privacy settings don&#x27;t support the kind of granularity needed to hide individual games, only enabling users to dictate broad categories - game details, friends list, inventory, screenshots, and workshop items - to keep discreet.


As spotted by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik, however (thanks PC Gamer), Valve is seemingly poised to add a &#x27;mark as private&#x27; setting to individual titles, so they can specifically be hidden from the prying eyes of friends. That means you won&#x27;t have to lock down huge chunks of your profile just to avoid difficult questions about the amount of time you&#x27;ve been playing Coquettish Elbow Reveal VR Edition. Or, in my case, 400 straight hours of Disney Dreamlight Valley.

                              <span>As part of its latest earnings call, Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav has outlined the company&#x27;s plans to transform its biggest gaming franchises from traditional console and PC releases into &quot;always on&quot; live service games.


Zaslav made the comments during his opening remarks to investors, in which referred to several of the company&#x27;s franchises - Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Batman, and Mortal Kombat - as $1bn gaming properties. Developer NetherRealm&#x27;s Mortal Kombat 1, he noted, has sold nearly 3m copies since launching in mid-September this year.


&quot;Our focus,&quot; he continued, &quot;is on transforming our biggest franchises from largely console and PC based with three-four year release schedules to include more always on gameplay through live services, multiplatform and free-to-play extensions, with the goal to have more players spending more time on more platforms.&quot;

                              <span>As reports of a Switch successor continue to build momentum, despite carefully phrased rebuffs from Nintendo, the Mario maker has said it&#x27;ll continue to release titles for its current console &quot;without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle.&quot;


Nintendo made the statement (thanks GameInformer) as part of its latest earnings report - in which it also confirmed Switch sales have now surpassed 132m units - writing, &quot;Switch will be entering its eighth year in March 2024. We will continue to release new titles and content for Nintendo Switch without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle.&quot; 


The inference (which isn&#x27;t the same as confirmation, of course) is that should a Switch successor launch next year, as is widely reported, Nintendo won&#x27;t be viewing it as end-of-life for its existing machine. That&#x27;s perhaps not much of a surprise given it&#x27;ll still have a substantial number of current Switch owners clamouring for new content with no plans to immediately upgrade, but it&#x27;s something of a departure from its traditional release strategy.

                              <span>Time Splitters studio Free Radical is reportedly the latest developer to be affected by Embracer Group&#x27;s sweeping restructuring programme, with the studio said to be facing closure.


Free Radical&#x27;s history is a long one and complicated one; the studio was founded in 1999 by a number of ex-Rare developers and quickly made a name for itself with the much-loved TimeSplitters FPS series. In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - which made this year&#x27;s Dead Island 2. However, in May 2021, Deep Silver announced it was reviving the Free Radical name and creating a new studio specifically to make more TimeSplitters, with original Free Radical co-founders Steve Ellis and David Doak at the helm.


Unfortunately, VGC now reports this new Free Radical is the latest studio to be impacted by parent company Embracer Group&#x27;s major restructuring programme, which was announced following the collapse of a massive $2bn deal in May and has resulted in extensive layoffs and closures throughout 2023.

Yesterday, developer Behaviour Interactive teased a forthcoming announcement, showing a rack of knives with one missing. 


Fans quickly speculated Chucky was on the way, and now we know they were right - he&#x27;ll be added in the next chapter on 28th November. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we share our hopes and fears for Nintendo&#x27;s now-officially confirmed The Legend of Zelda live-action movie.
The internet has leapt upon the announcement to suggest various names for Link, but who can you really see in the role - and can it not be Tom Holland, please? And definitely not Mark Wahlberg as an aged Link from the future. 
We also discuss the Zelda film&#x27;s potential story, and whether we think it will adapt any particular Zelda legend or simply follow the Mario movie&#x27;s example and go through the usual plot beats. Plus: the inevitable references Nintendo must include. And also... live-action Tingle? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

It looks like alert emails from Steam went out notifying fans of the game&#x27;s release, prompting some to download it and begin playing.
The mishap was fixed about 20 minutes later, after which the release date went through a rollercoaster of changes, including 31st December 1969, before ending up (correctly) on 17th November, 2023.

Other titles we recommend checking out from Humble Choice&#x27;s November games are the retro-inspired sci-fi shooter Prodeus and spaceship salvaging simulator Hardspace Shipbreaker.
We crowned Unpacking our game of the year in 2021 for its human storytelling and satisfying puzzles of tidying things up. In her Unpacking review, Malindy Hetfield called the game a &quot;calm and tactile little sim&quot; which also allows players &quot;personal expression and finding fun in what&#x27;s literally just stuff&quot;.

                              <span>The Marvels director Nia DaCosta has revealed she is a big fan of Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children and even used it as inspiration for the film.


The latest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero franchise is set for release later this week, with DaCosta admitting to IGN the Square Enix film was used as a reference for &quot;a couple of scenes&quot;.


&quot;It&#x27;s just an amazing, amazing movie, and has really great fight scenes and has a really great ending sequence with the main character being thrown into the sky by all the other characters,&quot; she said of Advent Children.

As is now tradition, a showcase featuring many of these mods - some available now, some still in development - has been released to commemorate the franchise&#x27;s annual N7 Day celebrations. 


You can watch that all below, as - with thanks to the modders behind each project and those who have put together the showcase - Eurogamer is able to highlight some of the many promising projects fans have to look forward to.

Player reviews on Steam so far are mixed, with most mentioning gameplay bugs, visual glitches, and terrible AI. Pendulo published a release announcement on launch day revealing it is aware of the issues players will encounter whilst playing.

Bloomberg sources have laid out Rockstar&#x27;s likely announcement plan for the game, with a brief announcement &quot;as early as this week&quot; and then a trailer for the game next month, in December. 


December&#x27;s trailer will come 25 years after the founding of Rockstar in December 1998, and a little over a decade since the original launch of Grand Theft Auto 5.

                              <span>Still doubtless beaming from the runaway success of this year&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. movie, Shigeru Miyamoto has confirmed a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie is in the works.


Details are sparse at present, but Miyamoto, announcing the news on Nintendo Japan&#x27;s Twitter/X account, said the project has already been in development for &quot;many years now&quot;. As per an accompanying press release, Miyamoto will produce the movie - which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution) - with Avi Arad, responsible for &quot;many hit films&quot;, also producing.


Arad&#x27;s films, if you&#x27;re wondering, are primarily (but not exclusively) within the superhero genre, ranging from this year&#x27;s acclaimed Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and its celebrated 2018 predecessor, to 2022&#x27;s Tom-Holland-starring Uncharted adaptation, as well as the likes of Venom, Morbius, the live-action Ghost in the Shell, and next year&#x27;s Borderlands movie.

Revenant Hill was officially unveiled back in May, teasing an adventure, set in the year 1919, that would follow Twigs the cat&#x27;s attempts to make ends meet after an &quot;owl from the next hill&quot; began demanding she pay rent on her wet log near an abandoned graveyard.


There were hints of systems reminiscent of farming sims, with crops to be grown and a community to be built as the seasons passed, albeit with a cast of witches, demons, and ghosts, and more serious considerations on its mind. &quot;Times are hard,&quot; The Glory Society wrote at the time, &quot;Something big and dark is at work in the towns, the factories, in the forests and hills. At some point, someone is going to have to push back. And they can&#x27;t do it alone.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Red Hook Studios has announced a first paid DLC pack for its acclaimed horror sequel Darkest Dungeon 2. It&#x27;s called The Binding Blade and will introduce two new heroes - one who&#x27;ll be familiar to fans of the first game - when it arrives in December.


Darkest Dungeon 2 left early access back in May this year, taking players on a grim Lovecraftian road trip that Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a &quot;copious and often brilliant, if not quite unmissable reworking of a powerfully grim fantasy&quot; in his Recommended review.


It&#x27;s a solid foundation, then, and Red Hook will initially build on Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s oppressive, tactical turn-based core by introducing two new playable heroes (or, perhaps more accurately, anti-heroes), along with a few other bits, when The Binding Blade arrives.

                              <span>BioWare has celebrated this year&#x27;s annual Mass Effect celebrations with a blog post that hints at Mass Effect 5&#x27;s title - and suggests fans will get answers to their burning questions concerning what happened after Mass Effect 3&#x27;s ending.


It&#x27;s unclear, however, whether this means these are coming in Mass Effect 5 - still several years away - or sooner, as part of N7 Day itself.


&quot;We&#x27;ve asked ourselves many of the same questions you&#x27;ve asked us over the years!&quot; Mass Effect boss Mike Gamble wrote. &quot;What happened to everyone you know and love in the games? Who really died? Who had kids with whom? What does a baby volus sound like?

                              <span>UPDATE 5pm UK: Ubisoft has responded with further details on this round of layoffs.
In a statement to Eurogamer, the company added more context to its reorganisation and confirmed it won&#x27;t affect production teams.
&quot;Over the past few months, every team within Ubisoft has been exploring ways to streamline our operations and enhance our collective efficiency so that we are better positioned for success in the long term,&quot; it said.

During an investor briefing held today following the company&#x27;s latest quarterly financial results, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa issued a blanket denial to address a swathe of reports that have mapped out the company&#x27;s progress towards launching its inevitable Switch successor. 

Nintendo showcased Switch 2 hardware capabilities to game developers in August around Gamescom in Cologne, Eurogamer reported at the time. Demos included a souped-up version of the original Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, meant to show off the Switch 2&#x27;s improved technical capabilities.

A number of free content additions are in development, but perhaps most intriguing is a new questline event - presumably to extend the core storyline.


The plan also includes ongoing weekly enhancements, including stability, performance, save game fixes, multiplayer improvements, balancing, increased boss difficulty, and other quality of life tweaks.

Fans have found that there&#x27;s a pettable dog (of course) featured during the game&#x27;s Trojan Horse mission, which you are encouraged to go stroke while attempting to blend into the level&#x27;s crowds. 


Linger on and continue looking at said dog after petting it and its name will soon pop up: Riley, the lovable German Shepherd who served as a squad member in Call of Duty Ghosts.

The game&#x27;s developer Behaviour Interactive pulled this content from the game back in November 2021 due to an expiration of its licensing agreement with Netflix.

According to its latest financial report from April to September 2023, company operating income has dropped by 33 percent and ordinary income by 42 percent.


That&#x27;s despite an increase in sales for its HD Games, owing to the releases of Final Fantasy 16 and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.

A new achievement for the game called Foehammer, which references an Honour mode, has been spotted on the GOG launcher and shared on the game&#x27;s subreddit. Fans of developer Larian Studios have recognised Honour mode from its previous appearances in Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition and Divinity: Original Sin 2. 
In the Divinity games, Honour mode only allows players one save, regardless of whether it was a manual, auto, or quick save. Permadeath is enabled, and if the player&#x27;s entire party dies the save is erased. That&#x27;s all on top of the extra difficulty added by Tactician mode, the second most difficult option after Honour mode.

                              <span>Ubisoft has finally allowed you to explore Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage without its chromatic aberration visual effect permanently switched on. 


An update for Mirage launches today for PC, PlayStation and Xbox which adds a toggle for the visual effect. There had been numerous fan complaints that it was simply too distracting, and many requests for it to be switched off or toned down.


You can download the update (version 1.0.5) from 1pm UK time and try the option for yourself. Download sizes for the update range from around 3 to 5GB, depending on platform.

Following its conclusion, Embark announced that a whopping 7.5 million players joined the beta to battle it out among the masses.


&quot;It&#x27;s been a thrilling week for the entire team, one that we&#x27;ll never forget. We&#x27;re utterly dazzled by your kindness, openness, and excitement throughout the entire Open Beta period,&quot; it wrote in a blog post over on Steam.

The group has chosen today - 7th November - as it is BioWare&#x27;s N7 Day, an annual celebration of the developer&#x27;s Mass Effect franchise.


13 former testers were employed by Keywords Studios but seconded to BioWare to work on 2021&#x27;s brilliant Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy remaster. This group then worked on the upcoming Dragon Age Dreadwolf - before a dispute erupted over their continuing ability to work remotely.

That&#x27;s according to Epic Games Store boss Steve Allison, who was speaking during a court hearing on Monday. 


As reported by The Verge, the exec was talking during the current Epic vs Google court case. Here, Allison said while the Epic Games Store still isn&#x27;t profitable, the company&#x27;s focus remains on &quot;growth&quot;. Additionally, according to emails shared during the trial, Epic had hoped to claim half of all gaming revenue for PC games.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Switch console has now passed 132m units sold, but the company is remaining silent on its successor.


According to Nintendo&#x27;s latest report detailing sales over the last financial quarter, Switch sales are still going strong. Unit sales for the Switch family of consoles rose 2.4 percent year-on-year, with the OLED model the most popular. A further 4.69m Switch OLEDs were sold, as clearly players are willing to spend extra on the improved screen, or to simply upgrade from the older model.


On a conference call after the earnings release, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa refused to comment on plans for a Switch successor, despite rumours of a 2024 release.

                              <span>Sony is dropping Twitter integration from its PlayStation consoles starting next Monday, 13th November, mirroring similar decisions made by Xbox and Blizzard earlier this year.


Twitter (or X, if you must) integration has long been a part of PlayStation&#x27;s operating system, giving users a quick and convenient way to share screenshots, videos, Trophy achievements, and more to social media. Unfortunately, all that&#x27;s about to end.


&quot;As of November 13, 2023,&quot; Sony wrote on its support site, &quot;integration with X...will no longer function on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles. This includes the ability to view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).&quot;

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 studio Colossal Order has pledged not to release paid DLC for its city building sequel until its heavily criticised performance issues have been &quot;fixed to our standards&quot;.


Performance concerns have, of course, dogged Cities: Skylines 2 even before its release, with Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive taking the unprecedented step of warning potential buyers that it had &quot;not achieved the benchmark we targeted&quot; prior to launch - but then going ahead and releasing it anyway because &quot;releasing now is the best way forward.&quot;


In the weeks since, Colossal Order has continued to chip away at Cities: Skylines 2&#x27;s performance issues and bugs (even the ones definitely not related to teeth), and it&#x27;s now followed-up last week&#x27;s patch with a new blog detailing some of the changes to come.

Burnout is, of course, a car racing game where players must &quot;prove [their] mettle and rise through the ranks to become the Burnout champion,&quot; its description reads.

The studio began work on the game after Metroid Prime 3 and had a working prototype built in that game&#x27;s engine, but Nintendo said no.


Until now, footage of the prototype hadn&#x27;t been made public, but a new video from YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming has revealed Adept - as well as fresh details on other cancelled games by Retro Studios.

&quot;Last week I left Embracer Group as COO, and it&#x27;s with mixed feelings I am parting ways [with] this global company phenomenon, rooted in Karlstad, Sweden,&quot; Strunke wrote. &quot;On one hand grateful for having had the chance to work with the one-of-a-kind Lars Wingefors [Embracer&#x27;s CEO] and all the other AMAZING colleagues (too many to mention!) which I will be sad to leave.

Pre-orders for the game have gone live from several retailers, though publisher Konami has yet to announce the release date for Silent Hill 2 Remake.
Amongst them, Best Buy has attracted attention for the following line in the product description: &quot;Fan-favourite character, Pyramid Head, makes a return along with a special origin story for fans to play through.&quot;

                              <span>Two months on from the release of Starfield, players are still waiting for Bethesda to address the numerous bugs which are present. But there&#x27;s a whole other group of players out there taking matters into their own hands - the team behind the Starfield Community Patch, an ambitious and surprisingly professional taskforce trying to fix the game themselves. The project came under the spotlight about a month before Starfield released. It was wild to think that a group of modders could already be working on a mod for Starfield before it had even released, but there they were - anticipating the Bethesda jank fans have come to expect. 


The SCP&#x27;s goal is to improve the vanilla experience of Starfield for players by fixing everything from major bugs to spelling errors, so long as it presents some sort of issue for players of the base game. The scope of the patch doesn&#x27;t include new content, balance changes (outside of correcting obvious errors), or anything which doesn&#x27;t fit with Bethesda&#x27;s original vision for the game.


I spoke to Timothy &quot;Halgari&quot; Baldridge, one of the founders of the SCP, to find out why the team came together to, in essence, do Bethesda&#x27;s work for them, and ask whether they&#x27;ve ever had any contact with Bethesda. I came away from our chat with a deeper appreciation for the project, which is more than just a simple effort to improve the experience of Starfield. It&#x27;s a collaborative effort between several modders and players to create a truly community-owned, open-source project, with standard practices of software development in place.

Narrative director Ben Arfmann and advanced writer Brittney Morris discussed how the ending of Spider-Man 2 will impact the likes of Peter, Miles and MJ, and spoke about a change of focus for Insomniac&#x27;s series.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 in the article below. If you are yet to finish the game, and wish to keep it as much a surprise as possible, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

                              <span>Two Diablo 4 developers have dropped a big hint about a previously-denied secret cow level in the game fans have been searching for.


As previously reported, Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson stated there&#x27;s &quot;no secret level&quot;, but this hasn&#x27;t stopped fans from hunting for one. There was seemingly a breakthrough made last month, too, after a player acquired a mysterious relic that required killing exactly 666 cows.


Now, at this weekend&#x27;s BlizzCon 2023, production director Tiffany Wat and associate game director Joe Piepiora hinted the secret cow level might be real after all.

                              <span>A new tour celebrating the &quot;most iconic video game music&quot; will kick off in May next year.

After two sold-out shows at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, Video Games in Concert is set to tour the UK next summer, stopping off in Brighton, Liverpool, Wolverhampton, Manchester, and Bournemouth. Sadly, there are no dates outside of England at this time. 

&quot;Video Games in Concert is a critically acclaimed concert series that features one of the world’s premier composers of video games scores, Eímear Noone, who is responsible for some of the most enduring soundscapes on World of Warcraft and other best-selling video games,&quot; a press release says.

                              <span>Comparisons between the OG PS5 and the PS5 Slim are out, and some say the sleeker new design is &quot;not that much smaller&quot; than its chunkier sibling.

Dave2D has provided a detailed teardown of the brand-new console system, showing off the machine&#x27;s trimmer stature and the console&#x27;s new outer cover, which now boasts a half matte, half gloss finish. This means any panels bought for the original system cannot be used on the updated one, as it essentially has four separate pieces. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dave2D made specific mention of the weight difference. Whilst the original version weighs in at either 3.9kg or 3.3kg, depending upon whether or not you have the digital version or the system with the disc drive, the new models weighs 3.2kg or 2.6kg respectively.

                              <span>The Flipper Zero is an incredibly versatile hacking device. Now it can be used to crash iPhones in its vicinity by sending them a never-ending stream of pop-ups.
These types of hacks have been possible for decades, but they require special equipment and a fair amount of expertise. The capabilities generally required expensive SDRs­—short for software-defined radios­—that, unlike traditional hardware-defined radios, use firmware and processors to digitally re-create radio signal transmissions and receptions. The $200 Flipper Zero isn’t an SDR in its own right, but as a software-controlled radio, it can do many of the same things at an affordable price and with a form factor that’s much more convenient than the previous generations of SDRs...</span>
