We’re now learning that the CIA is still “using an irresponsibly secured system for asset communication.”
Citizen Lab did the research:
Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used these sites for covert communication...</span>

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing the failure of Stadia, and why Google&#x27;s cloud gaming gamble struggled from the start.


The announcement of Stadia&#x27;s demise came as a shock to some - including many developers with titles only weeks from launch - yet still feels like it was on the cards for some time. After a rocky launch and the closure of Google&#x27;s internal game development studios, what future did Stadia have left? Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson weighed in earlier today with his thoughts.

Could Stadia have been a success? What does this all mean for game preservation? And if Google failed, with all of its billions, what future does cloud gaming have elsewhere? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, and Liv Ngan share their thoughts.

                              <span>A lifelong Nintendo fan has decided to make a realistic Super Mario Bros remake, and posted a movie-style trailer on YouTube to document their most recent update.

The YouTuber, who has uploaded their videos to the channel Re-Imagined Games, started work on the remake over two months ago.

In order to create the game, they&#x27;ve had to learn Unreal Engine 5 with zero experience in video game development.

                              <span>Google reportedly turned down a Stadia exclusive follow-up to Hideo Kojima&#x27;s Death Stranding.


According to a new report from 9to5google, the project received initial approval but as it was intended to be a strictly single-player experience (instead of the asynchronous multiplayer in Death Stranding), the Kojima collaboration was cancelled as Google believed there was no longer a market for solo games.



Despite reaching the early stages of development, the project was reportedly cancelled by Stadia&#x27;s general manager Phil Harrison in mid 2020 following the first mockups.

These tidbits are not meant to tease any particular storyline from Dreadwolf, but are included in a blog post detailing how BioWare&#x27;s writing team works together to build Dragon Age&#x27;s expansive world. 


The first codex entry presented here comes from a character&#x27;s diary - someone who, if we had to guess, is likely one of your new companions.

Quality assurance tester Mackenzie Clifton has spoken publicly to Axios about their departure from Nintendo of America, and revealed both the question on unionisation they asked, as well as the &quot;confidential information&quot; they were accused of leaking. 


During a January company Q&amp;A with Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser, Clifton says they submitted the following question: &quot;What does NoA think about the unionisation trend in QA in the games industry as of late?&quot;

                              <span>A little over six months after its big reveal, World of Warcraft&#x27;s Dragonflight expansion has been given a release date, with its launch now officially scheduled for 28th November this year.


As detailed back in April, Dragonflight&#x27;s first major addition is a new location known as the Dragon Isles, the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind. This, in turn, brings four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, the expansive Ohn&#x27;ahran Plains, the frozen Azure Span, and the majestic Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also introduces a new playable race-class hybrid (a first for WoW) known as the Dracthyr Evokers, which can switch between human and draconic forms. Depending on a player&#x27;s chosen class specialisations, its focus is either damage dealing or healing.

                              <span>Google is shutting down Stadia, with the beleaguered cloud gaming service set to remain live for players until 18th January 2023.


Stadia&#x27;s misfortunes are, of course, well-documented; despite initial praise for the service&#x27;s streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia&#x27;s failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.


And while Google continued to insist Stadia was &quot;alive and well&quot; as 2021 progressed, reports claimed it had &quot;deprioritised&quot; the consumer-facing side of its game streaming platform, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services&#x27; underlying technology to third-parties.

The highlight of this new investment package is 50bn riyals (£12bn) earmarked for the acquisition of &quot;a leading game publisher to become a strategic development partner,&quot; according to the state&#x27;s press agency.  


Another 70 billion riyals (£16bn) is pegged for minority stakes in other companies, while the rest will be spent targeting industry disruptors and mature industry partners to enhance Savvy&#x27;s portfolio.

                              <span>Shenmue: The Animation, which got its debut season in February, has been cancelled. 


The anime adaptation of the cult classic Sega game was first announced back in September 2020, before being broadcasted and available to stream on Adult Swim and Crunchyroll respectively.  


A second season was reportedly in the works before the cancellation, which is likely a part of the wider purge by Warner Discovery of its properties following the merger of the two media conglomerates in April this year.

The apps we downloaded from Google Play also showed differences based on country in their security and privacy capabilities. One hundred twenty-seven apps varied in what the apps were allowed to access on users’ mobile phones, 49 of which had additional permissions deemed “dangerous” by Google. Apps in Bahrain, Tunisia and Canada requested the most additional dangerous permissions.
Three VPN apps enable clear text communication in some countries, which allows unauthorized access to users’ communications. One hundred and eighteen apps varied in the number of ad trackers included in an app in some countries, with the categories Games, Entertainment and Social, with Iran and Ukraine having the most increases in the number of ad trackers compared to the baseline number common to all countries...</span>

Immutable fields can be found in a few places in the built-in Kubernetes types.
For example, you can&#x27;t change the .metadata.name of an object. Specific objects
have fields where changes to existing objects are constrained; for example, the
.spec.selector of a Deployment.
Aside from simple immutability, there are other common design patterns such as
lists which are append-only, or a map with mutable values and immutable keys.
Until recently the best way to restrict field mutability for CustomResourceDefinitions
has been to create a validating
admission webhook:
this means a lot of complexity for the common case of making a field immutable.
Beta since Kubernetes 1.25, CEL Validation Rules allow CRD authors to express
validation constraints on their fields…</span>

In a Twitter thread, developer Gameloft said it expected the update to launch &quot;in around three weeks&quot;, and fix several priority bugs such as issues with lost progress, missing founder&#x27;s pack rewards, and general console crashes.


October&#x27;s update will also add new features, such as an improved photo mode and new poses for your character avatar.

An advert for one game, Refantasia: Charm and Conquer, is described as having featured an &quot;anime-style image of a young woman in a cage&quot; in shackles and with torn clothing, which was singled out for particular criticism. 


Captions referenced &quot;my master&quot; and were accompanied by text which described the person as a &quot;little girl&quot;. The ASA judged the character as being someone under 18 represented in a sexual manner.

That story will now explain how players got to be so Honey I Shrunk The Kids small, Obsidian says, and potentially also allow you to &quot;go big and go home&quot; once all is said and done. 


Before that, though, there&#x27;s plenty of new things to experience in version 1.0. A new area of the garden, the Eastern Upper Yard, has been opened up to players. It features a new tunnel system, more towering manmade items and fresh &quot;angry bugs&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m just going to do what I&#x27;m going to do,&quot; he said. &quot;[Artemis is] this thing that we want to create, and it&#x27;s going to give people a lot of fun, a lot of pleasure, and a lot of meaningful things to do. But it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s called the metaverse. I don&#x27;t care what people want to call it.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret we&#x27;re big fans of PowerWash Simulator here at Eurogamer which, for me, makes this hour-long development deep dive video something of a must-watch. 


I&#x27;ve often wondered while playing whether certain objects auto-complete faster than others. If you&#x27;re yet to try PowerWash yourself, it&#x27;s worth knowing the game will, after you clean a certain amount of surface area, auto-complete the rest of the object in question. (This also provides a nice &#x27;ding&#x27; sound.)


This subject is one of many covered in the developer video, which is ostensibly about how levels in the game are created but also delves into thoughts on dirt design, parkour, and the game&#x27;s lack of fall damage.

Custom-made trombones? Check. An actual brass trombone? Check.

Microsoft says this controller is inspired by &quot;geode crystals&quot;, and that it &quot;finds the perfect balance between striking and subdued.&quot;

However, the teen did plead guilty to breaching bail conditions, Eurogamer understands. 


In a statement to Eurogamer this afternoon, the City of London Police&#x27;s Cyber Crime Unit acknowledged the individual had appeared in court over the weekend - and was now being held at a youth detention centre.

                              <span>Yves Guillemot, boss and co-founder of Ubisoft, has raised eyebrows for his comments on the need for &quot;a little friction&quot; in game development. 


Discussing his company&#x27;s troubles with harassment and workplace toxicity, as highlighted by a number of employees since the summer of 2020, Guillemot told La Presse that Ubisoft had been &quot;progressing at a good pace&quot; in dealing with its issues - but that &quot;creating a video game is not easy&quot; and sometimes created &quot;a lot of tension&quot;. 


&quot;Techniques must be put in place to ensure that everyone succeeds in finding their place,&quot; Guillemot continued, now discussing the games industry in general. &quot;To create, you need a little friction, because everyone has to succeed in getting their idea across. It&#x27;s a job that brings a lot of rewards when you succeed, but it&#x27;s difficult.&quot;

                              <span>It looks like Team Ninja&#x27;s Nioh games won&#x27;t be heading to Xbox anytime soon.


Both Nioh games were originally released on PS4 and PC, but never on Microsoft&#x27;s console.


Speaking to VGC, Nioh director Fumihiko Yasuda downplayed any possibility of the game coming to Xbox.

                              <span>Yesterday, as part of The Last of Us day, we were treated to the first full trailer for the franchise&#x27;s upcoming HBO adaptation, starring Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This trailer didn&#x27;t have any real dialogue between the characters (there were plenty of tense looks and some furtive Shh-ing), but it still offered an evocative picture of the world that HBO has created for its TV audience. You can see this trailer for yourself below. 


Right off the bat, it is clear HBO has taken this adaptation seriously, with several scenes looking like they have been pulled straight from Naughty Dog&#x27;s video game series. There is a lot to unpack in the minute and half or so of footage, so let&#x27;s dive on in.

                              <span>One GTA Online player has become a billionaire in-game, nine years after the game released.

Reddit user jamcar70 shared their impressive milestone on the game&#x27;s subreddit, to a stunned response.

The feat took jamcar70 two years, 34 days and four hours of playtime to achieve, as shown on their screenshot to prove their in-game savings.

The Altar of Hope update adds a new type of reward - Candles of Hope - which you can earn and then spend on various attributes which should make future missions safer for your party.


As you&#x27;d expect, the bigger the danger, the bigger reward in terms of Candles bagged at the end. Missions will offer more Candles the further you manage to progress, but suffer a wipe and you&#x27;ll see your Candle hoard penalised.

Speaking to IGN, Kato admitted he likes the style but the 2D pixel art of the original has been retained instead.


&quot;No, we didn&#x27;t think about making it HD-2D,&quot; he said. &quot;We kind of played with the idea of making it 3D, but what we were really thinking about was, &#x27;What are the major parts about this game that are really appealing to everybody?&#x27; And in the 2D original, it was really well done pixel art, so we realised that we couldn&#x27;t have a Tactics Ogre game without this really high-quality, awesome looking 2D pixel art. So to bring that sort of resolution and that sort of fidelity to new hardware and new technology was a lot of effort. But yeah, I think we did it.&quot;

One nice to have but unexpected new feature is the ability to disable critical commentary. Here&#x27;s the option in the main game settings:


Checking this box means the commentators won&#x27;t point out how bad you&#x27;re doing during gameplay, but will say all the other normal stuff they say during a match.

                              <span>Following on in his grandson&#x27;s footsteps, Rick from Rick and Morty is making his way into Warner Bros. Smash-like brawler MultiVersus today as part of its new 1.03 update.


Along with this news, we also have a breakdown of his moveset. 


This will include fart bombs (of course) and a move called &quot;Meeseeks and Destroys&quot; which summons a meeseek that will then attack by running forward and deploying an uppercut or by wielding a golfclub. Lastly, Rick will be able to aim and place two portals thanks to his &quot;Basrick Portal Theory&quot; move.

The news comes alongside the release of the soundtrack to JRPG Tales of Arise, available from today.


That follows the release of Elden Ring&#x27;s soundtrack, which was made available on streaming services earlier this month.

                              <span>Take-Two Interactive, publisher of GTA and Borderlands, has pulled out of a development and publishing agreement with People Can Fly, the company behind Outriders and Gears of War Judgment.


A financial update from People Can Fly states that Take-Two is ditching the project after two years of work - but that development will still continue. 


Codenamed Project Dagger, the game is said to be a new action adventure IP, which People Can Fly now retains the rights to. It sounds like Take-Two had the option to purchase these rights - which it has not exercised.

The report recommends that regulators should 1) enforce minimum security standards for manufacturers of IoT devices, 2) incentivize higher levels of security through public contracting, and 3) try to align IoT standards internationally (for example, international guidance on handling connected devices that stop receiving security updates)...</span>

                              <span>Today is The Last of Us day, an annual occasion formerly known as Outbreak Day that marks the in-universe date in which the Cordyceps infection spread throughout humanity. 


This year, to celebrate the occasion, Naughty Dog and HBO have released a new trailer for their upcoming TV adaptation, which stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This new trailer gives us all a closer look at Ellie and Joel in action as they make their way across America. Along with seeing more of the two protagonists, we now also have a better, but still brief look at the series&#x27; infected Clickers - complete with their unmistakable and haunting noises. Other characters such as Ellie&#x27;s friend Riley also make a showing. You can see the trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>Battlefield 2042 Season 2 continues today with the arrival of update 2.1, which most notably reworks the (appropriately named) map Renewal. 


DICE has taken the decision &quot;to competely remove certain sections of the map&quot; which it has decided broke the game&#x27;s &quot;flow&quot; or were simply &quot;too far away&quot;. 


Getting around the game will be quicker too - as Battlefield adds the Polaris RZR buggy as an in-world vehicle. To my eyes, it looks like a cross between a tank and a golf cart. Why not?

The new studio will be based in Helsinki and led by Marko Lastikka as director, formerly of Zynga and EA.


The studio will create &quot;world class&quot; original games without ads or in-app purchases, reports Engadget.

Their latest mod is Trombone Champ, the surprise Steam hit of last week.

Raicuparta shared a video of himself attempting Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony in VR. The display inside the headset shows a first-person view of the titular Trombone Champ and the gameplay screen is projected in front of you. The game is played with motion controls, meaning you have to extend and retract your arm instead of moving a mouse back and forth for the correct notes.

The LA-based show will open its doors for the first time since 2019 at its usual home of the Los Angeles Convention Centre, following mixed success as an online event in the interim. 


Next year will see the LACC&#x27;s two main halls divided into separate spaces for industry attendees and those attending as fans - similar to how the various halls are separated at Gamescom.

                              <span>A Mario fan has used Super Mario Maker 2 to create a whole game inspired by the classic Mario games.

Twitter user MetroidMike64 spent seven years working on his Super World, which he has unofficially named Super Mario Bros. 5, and uploaded the finished product online yesterday.
MetroidMike64 began creating levels in 2015 using Super Mario Maker on the Wii U, and had always intended for them to be part of a larger game.

                              <span>The ever-expanding world of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will receive one of its final major updates tomorrow, as it adds a final set of puzzle tombs via patch 1.6.1. 


This activity was originally added to the game earlier this year, and adds a new storyline expanding upon the series&#x27; mysterious precursor Isu race, doled out by exploring a string of fun puzzle dungeons. 


It also allows for Eivor to come face-to-face with a series of British figures from history before her time - such as the ancient queen of the Iceni, Boudicca. Fans have some interesting theories on who may pop up in this concluding set of dungeons (including someone perhaps more from Assassin&#x27;s Creed lore than actual history itself).

Sable: Design Works will be the first instalment from publisher Lost in Cult&#x27;s new series of indie-focussed art books. This particular release, which is due to launch in the second quarter of 2023, will feature interviews from those at developer Shedworks, as well as a &quot;region-by-region insight&quot; into the world of Midden and its art.


The book itself will be split into two different sections, one that &quot;charts the development of Sable from its early concept and prototype, through its production, to launch&quot; and one that focuses exclusively on the artwork and visuals.

The developer - which has assisted with work on the Halo series from as far back as Halo 2 - was reported to be working on a new battle royale mode back in January. The following month, it issued a statement to confirm it was &quot;deepening&quot; its relationship with franchise holder 343 Industries. 


Now, Certain Affinity exec Paul Sams has said the studio&#x27;s still-technically-unannounced project had been in the works for more than two years, with almost 100 staff working on it.

Marvel exec Bill Rosemann set the record straight as part of a GamesIndustry.biz interview, which comes after a succession of announcements for upcoming Iron Man, Black Panther and Wolverine  games.


&quot;The world is, amazingly, very familiar and accepting of the multiverse,&quot; Rosemann said. &quot;We have all these different realities. Now they&#x27;re all real, and we want to give everyone the freedom to tell their story.

The unamed teen has been charged with two counts of computer misuse, as well as two counts of breaching bail conditions. 


These latter charges likely refer to the teen&#x27;s previous run-in with police over hacking charges - when they were suspected of breaching both Microsoft and Samsung earlier in the year.

But what if you were to throw a load of zombie-like monsters into this experience, and then proceed to turn out the lights, leaving the exit near impossible to find? Well, one developer has decided to answer that question in its upcoming game: The Store is closed.


The Store is Closed is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games&#x27; The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy (thanks, PCGamesN).

                              <span>There&#x27;s an Onimusha anime in the works for Netflix, Capcom has announced.


This adaptation of Capcom&#x27;s dormant samurai action series is produced by Sublimation Inc., the same company that handled the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma series that was streamed on Netflix in 2020, and is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer, 13 Assassins).


Details are scarce, but Capcom said the anime has &quot;3DCG&quot; animated characters with hand-drawn backgrounds. Protagonist Miyamoto Musashi is modeled on Toshihiro Mifune, the Japanese actor famous for appearing in multiple Akira Kurosawa films who died 25 years ago.

Since then, SIG Storage and other Kubernetes special interest groups are working to ensure feature stability and compatibility in preparation for CSI Migration feature to go GA.
SIG Storage is excited to announce that the core CSI Migration feature is generally available in Kubernetes v1.25 release!
SIG Storage wrote a blog post in v1.23 for CSI Migration status update which discussed the CSI migration status for each storage driver. It has been a while and this article is intended to give a latest status update on each storage driver for their CSI Migration status in Ku…</span>

Describing screen culture as &quot;young, dynamic and expanding&quot;, the BFI says &quot;it presents a wider screen landscape that encompasses film, television, digital media, extended reality (XR) and video games&quot; and says &quot;it has become the dominant means of communication, information and storytelling for Gen Z and beyond&quot;.

                              <span>A new PC mod is replacing the face and voice of a Judgment character whose original likeness was unceremoniously pulled several years ago following a drugs arrest.

Originally, the character model and voice for Judgement character Kyohei Hamura was based upon Japanese musician and actor Pierre Taki. Shortly after his drugs arrest, however, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios scrambled to replace him with the voice and likeness of Japanese actor Miou Tanaka instead.

Modder Timo 654, however, has brought Taki back to life - so to speak - by meticulously restoring the original voice lines and likeness.

Whilst we&#x27;ve yet to hear of a definitive date, creator Yoko Taro was at least able to confirm the release window during Aniplex Online Fest, which took place over the weekend.

Interestingly, Taro also revealed that due to the differences between storytelling via games and traditional mediums - and despite Aniplex&#x27;s hopes of a faithful retelling of the game - the anime&#x27;s story will differ.

                              <span>The Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 beta has hit a new concurrent peak of nearly 170,000 players on PC, making it one of the most played games on Steam right now.

According to SteamDB, the beta is currently sporting more concurrent players than Team Fortress 2, Destiny 2, GTA 5, and even Cyberpunk 2077, which has seen a boost in its own player numbers recently, too. 

With an all-time concurrent peak of 168,330 players (at the time of writing, anyway; it&#x27;s been increasing steadily all weekend), that means it&#x27;s already beaten the concurrent records for games like Left 4 Dead 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, The Division, FIFA 22, and Borderlands 2.

Twitterer Shinobi602 - a games industry brand manager - found themselves intrigued enough by the sci-fi horror&#x27;s most recent promotional video that they texted the number that pops up in the latest trailer.

After texting the number, Shinobi received a mysterious video response. The secretive teaser flashes words like &quot;secrets, answers, ARCAS, lies&quot; and ends with a date: 29th September.

We also discovered that spin-off The Witcher: Blood Origin will premier &quot;this December&quot;, which is set to star Minnie Driver as the Narrator.

Bandai Namco was originally forced to shutter the PC PvP servers for all Dark Souls games back in January following &quot;reports of an issue with online servers&quot;. Although the publisher described the situation as &quot;temporary&quot;, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3&#x27;s servers finally coming back online at the end of August… and going down again earlier this week.

On 21st September, Bandai Namco said &quot;there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls 3 online play via the Steam platform&quot; and revealed that it was &quot;investigating the source of the problem&quot;, but the servers remained offline for several days.

                              <span>It&#x27;s weekend two of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 beta - and now PC, PlayStation and Xbox players are all getting stuck in, cheaters have entered the battlefield.

And, in response, console players are disabling crossplay in a bid to avoid matching up with those on PC - the platform believed to have the most trouble with hackers.


If it sounds like you&#x27;ve read this story before, it&#x27;s because the same thing happened with the beta for last year&#x27;s Call of Duty Vanguard and 2020&#x27;s Black Ops Cold War.

Knight&#x27;s departure from Twitch means the firm has lost its chief content officer, chief operating officer, and Knight&#x27;s position in the last year alone (thanks, Bloomberg).

In a joint statement, the partnership said that despite 1.3 billion women and girls making up half of the global game&#x27;s community – 60 per cent of whom started gaming before turning 13 – 60 per cent of &quot;girl gamers&quot; polled by Dove &quot;feel misrepresented and recognise a lock of diversity as a key issue in video games&quot;.

35 per cent of young girls also reported that their &quot;self-esteen is negatively impacted after seeing a lack of diversity in characters and avatars&quot;.

Ninja Theory was named by GLHF as a company that utilises the services of Altered AI, a tech firm that supports studios in creating &quot;compelling, professional voice performances&quot; via AI rather than professional – and real – voice actors. 

The report stopped short of revealing the minutiae of the arrangement, however, stating that &quot;the details of their partnership are under wraps&quot;.

                              <span>The Outsiders and Funcon have released a behind-the-scenes (BTS) video showcasing how the rhythm FPS came to be. 

Exploring the &quot;origins of the game, including exclusive interviews with the game&#x27;s creators, music composers, and some of its amazing voice talent&quot;, the BTS documentary also includes conversations with the soundtrack creators, Elvira Björkman and Nicklas Hjertberg of Two Feathers.

You can check out the 15-minute video – which includes a sneaky peek at Two Feathers&#x27; &quot;huge live concert&quot; at Gamescom – below:

                              <span>PUBG Mobile has released a new anti-cheat system that it says has already cut cheating by half.

Developer Krafton says the system, called Fog of War, &quot;helps mask the movements of other players from cheaters using x-ray vision/wall hacks&quot;, and states that during the testing period, cheating fell by 62 per cent in &quot;certain regions&quot;.  

&quot;The first of its kind in mobile gaming, Fog of War is an advanced anti-cheat system that limits the game information a player receives, reducing their ability to see players out of their field of view or through walls and objects,&quot; Krafton explains.

Our models and experimental results in a controlled lab setting show it is possible to reconstruct and recognize with over 75 percent accuracy on-screen texts that have heights as small as 10 mm with a 720p webcam.” That corresponds to 28 pt, a font size commonly used for headings and small headlines.
[…]
Being able to read reflected headline-size text isn’t quite the privacy and security problem of being able to read smaller 9 to 12 pt fonts. But this technique is expected to provide access to smaller font sizes as high-resolution webcams become more common...</span>

This range consists of a Sly plushy (seen in the header image), a print of some anniversary artwork by the original Sly Cooper&#x27;s art director Dev Madan and an anniversary T-shirt.


The artwork is certainly an impressive collection of nostalgia for Sly Cooper fans. Madan has rammed it full of references and Easter eggs from the last 20 years.

                              <span>A fresh batch of freebies has arrived on the Epic Games Store, with this week&#x27;s offerings coming in the form of dinosaur survival adventure Ark: Survival Evolved and the video game adaptation of acclaimed board game Gloomhaven.


This isn&#x27;t Ark: Survival Evolved&#x27;s first outing as an Epic freebie - it was given away in June 2020 - but if you&#x27;re a survival fan who hasn&#x27;t yet given it a look, it&#x27;s still probably worth checking out.


Released back in August 2017 after several years in early access, Ark&#x27;s base game offers a broadly compelling (if rather rickety) blend of dinosaur taming and breeding, base building, and survival meter management, all in service of massive-scale tribal warfare - unless you opt to join a PvE server, in which case your most terrifying foe is usually a pillar. Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic&#x27;s freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game&#x27;s rhythms, you might find more to your taste.

                              <span>In a turn up for the books, all characters in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope will have voices, something Ubisoft had previously said could not happen.


Creative director Davide Soliani was initially told Rabbids were not to speak by Ubisoft. However, thanks to some creative manipulation of the rules and a successful bid by Soliani to &quot;gain trust&quot; from Ubisoft, Mario and his Rabbid companions will now talk during their upcoming escapades (thanks, IGN).


Let&#x27;s rewind back to the start to understand how this all came about.

&quot;Recently, we have seen increased harassment of our development team,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We welcome community input, however, the line between constructive feedback and the harassment of our dev team cannot be crossed.&quot;


&quot;We want to remind our players that we have a zero tolerance policy for threats and the harassment of our developers,&quot; the statement continued. &quot;We will take appropriate action to ensure the healthy and safety of our team&quot;.

Last night, I finished Return to Monkey Island. It was an amazing moment for me, and as I sat watching the credits roll with my heart feeling pleasantly full I saw a name make its way up the screen that I did not expect to see there - Neil Druckmann.


&quot;Neil Druckmann?&quot; my mind tried to compute, as my lips verbalised my amazement. Surely not the Neil Druckmann whose Ellie and Joel can be heard cussing left, right and centre in a game that is definitely not for children.

As you may have surmised from the headline already, this page sees all of Steam&#x27;s top games bundled together in one place. It will replace the usual Steam Stats many of you may be familiar with.


&quot;Today we&#x27;re launching Steam Charts, a new section of Steam that is dedicated to showing the most-played and top-selling games on Steam. Including numbers in real time,&quot; Valve said in a statement (thanks, Kotaku).

                              <span>Seven new patent filings from Destiny developer Bungie have been unearthed, predominantly all linked to virtual controls on touch-enabled devices, lending further credence to reports earlier this year that it had a Destiny mobile game in the works.


Those reports first surfaced back in July, when The Game Post, citing a source with knowledge of Chinese mobile developer NetEase&#x27;s plans, claimed the company was collaborating with Bungie to bring a completely new instalment in the Destiny series to mobile - a project said to have already been in development for several years.


It&#x27;s in this context that the seven newly unearthed Bungie patents (as spotted by The Game Post) prove particularly interesting. Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an &#x27;isometric/top-down&#x27; perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.

                              <span>Google&#x27;s Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.


Known as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico&#x27;s National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. 


This clearly can&#x27;t be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do &quot;love exploring&quot;. The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza.

The initial leaker is known as Teapot and used the account @teapotuberhacker, but the forum believes another user, with the moniker Lily, also had access to this account.


It’s unclear whether this second user has access to any hacked material, though the forum believes this is not the case.

In Kubernetes 1.25, Validation rules for CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) have graduated to Beta!
Validation rules make it possible to declare how custom resources are validated using the Common Expression Language (CEL). For example:
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
 ...
 openAPIV3Schema:
 type: object
 properties:
 spec:
 type: object
 x-kubernetes-validations:
 - rule: &quot;self.minReplicas &lt;&#x3D; self.replicas &amp;&amp; self.replicas &lt;&#x3D; self.maxReplicas&quot;
 message: &quot;replicas should be in the range minReplicas..maxReplicas.&quot;
 properties:
 replicas:
 type: integer

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing video game leaks, following last weekend&#x27;s devastating hack of Rockstar Games which saw almost an hour of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage spilled onto the internet and promptly dissected by the masses.


The sheer fact Rockstar had been hacked in this manner was itself shocking - but the damage felt worse due to the negative comments this work-in-progress content then received. The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.

After that, we turn our attention to the YouTuber who accidentally outed themselves as being behind an &quot;insider&quot; Twitter account after posting under-wraps information they had been given by Ubisoft.

                              <span>As Microsoft starts to feel more heat from regulatory bodies over its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, CEO Satya Nadella has said he&#x27;s &quot;very confident” the deal will go through.


Governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition has grown in recent weeks, with the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority announcing it was moving to a more in-depth &quot;phase 2&quot; of its investigation, having determined the acquisition would give rise to the &quot;realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


Sony, too, has grown increasingly vocal over the proposed deal, particularly as it pertains to potential console exclusivity around the likes of Call of Duty. Early this month, for instance, PlayStation head Jim Ryan called Microsoft&#x27;s reassurances that the hugely popular shooter would remain on PS5 post-acquisition &quot;inadequate&quot;.

                              <span>One of the most integral parts to any good FIFA game, aside from the football, is the soundtrack.


A running theme around the FIFA community is that every new game introduced players to their next favourite tune. And as the years go by, the tracks serve as a nostalgia trip to playing FIFA after a long day of school or work. 


Now EA has revealed the full track list for FIFA 23, and you can stream it all now in a dedicated Spotify playlist.

Bloody Ties - the first of two bits of story DLC currently confirmed as part of Dying Light 2&#x27;s five year journey of post-launch support - takes players to The Carnage Hall, an old opera house said to be the &quot;epicentre of death, wealth and absolute splendour&quot;. Here, they&#x27;ll find &quot;challenges and quests, surprising new weapon types, character interactions, and discoveries to uncover.&quot;


This initial bit of story DLC was originally expected to launch in June but was delayed to September for additional development. That date then slipped again, with Techland announcing a 13th October release date as August came to an end.

This time around, the collaboration will be in Sheeran&#x27;s area of expertise.

Grand Theft Auto IV - Definitive Edition is a project which complied a number of mods which aimed to enhance and update the game to run on modern PCs (thanks, PC Gamer). 


The game was last updated by Rockstar in 2020, when the developer removed the archaic Games for Windows Live DRM after it was shut down by Microsoft. However, this also had the unfortunate effect of disabling access to online multiplayer and leaderboards, which were run through the GFWL backend.

This listing (spotted by PSU) is for a scriptwriter and reads: &quot;Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience&quot;.


The post goes on to state that Ubisoft intends to &quot;keep the spirit and themes of the original game&quot; with this remake while &quot;exploring [its] characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable.&quot;

If you&#x27;re yet to try it, Spiritfarer is a memorable and moving adventure game where you shepard a crew of lost souls into the after life, while slowly upgrading your boat.


In a nutshell, it&#x27;s a &quot;cosy management game about dying&quot;, and one of my favourite games from 2020. If this news means more people get to play it - all the better!

                              <span>Nintendo preservation site Forest of Illusion, in collaboration with Render Archive and NintendoWarden, have uncovered what appears to be a cut stage from Super Mario 64. 


The screenshot reel from a pre-release build of the game was found in the long-sought after 1996 Nintendo Company Report. 


The report, which has been carefully scanned and uploaded here, includes the standard yearly company round-up, plus some accompanying images of Nintendo&#x27;s star roster and various consoles including the Nintendo 64 and the destined for failure Virtual Boy.

                              <span>Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth has been delayed until December.


Lenneth is an enhanced version of the original 1999 PS1 RPG Valkyrie Profile that was released on PSP in 2007 - its first release in the PAL region.


It was set for a re-release alongside the forthcoming action-RPG Valkyrie Elysium, available both separately and included in the deluxe edition, but now will arrive a little later.

                              <span>Return to Monkey Island has just come out, and the reception to it has been overwhelmingly positive. This reception has, of course, not been missed by those at Lucasfilm Games, or more specifically, Craig Derrick who worked with Ron Gilbert and co to get the game released. 


Now, Derrick has shared his delight at all the positive feedback for Return to Monkey Island in a heartfelt Twitter thread. 


This alone is nice but not especially newsworthy. However, at the end of his thread, Derrick wrote some simple words that have caught the world&#x27;s eye: &quot;I&#x27;ll be standing by when it&#x27;s time to go BACK TO THE MANSION!&quot;

                              <span>The adorable fox-themed Tunic is making the leap to PlayStation and Switch soon. Ahead of these releases, its developer has shared some behind the scenes titbits about the game&#x27;s manual, including how a real one was made to ensure authenticity within the game


Sharing on the PlayStation Blog, Tunic&#x27;s lead developer Andrew Shouldice expressed his love for old-school game&#x27;s manuals. &quot;The more I thought about it though, the more I realised that my love for this kind of mystery came not just from the games, but from the manuals they were packaged with,&quot; Shouldice wrote, stating he would &quot;pore over these documents endlessly&quot;.


Such was Shouldice&#x27;s love for these manuals, he decided to incorporate one into Tunic&#x27;s gameplay. In this case, the player picks up pages for the manual as they make their way through the game&#x27;s mysterious word. These are then pieced together, allowing the player to uncover more of Tunic&#x27;s many (many) secrets.

                              <span>The Grand Theft Auto community has started to map out the game world of the next GTA game using leaks as their source. 


We know very little about the next game from official channels, but the huge leak on Monday gave us our biggest (albeit unfinished) look at the title. 


Moreover, with various reports reporting on the game&#x27;s location, characters and gameplay elements, there appears to be enough to go on to start the mapping process.

Yet nestled in the patch notes is a social update to add a &quot;disruptive gameplay-based behaviour indicator&quot;.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Nvidia announced its next series of GeForce RTX cards - and raised eyebrows at how much some of them will cost.


At the top end, the RTX 4090 will cost an eye-watering $1599. The RTX 4080 16GB will cost $1199, while the RTX 4080 12GB will cost $899.


Many had hoped for lower prices - but, according to Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, these costs reflect a world where Moore&#x27;s law - where performance is doubled for half the price every two years - is now &quot;dead&quot;.

What we&#x27;re getting is a DLC package known as the Winters Expansion, which will include a third-person mode for the base game, a rework of the Mercenaries Mode which will introduce new playable characters such as Lady Dimitrescu, and the new story-based chapter known as Shadows of Rose.


Shadows of Rose will put Ethan Winters&#x27; daughter into the spotlight as she makes her way through the  consciousness of the Megamycete. This, Capcom has said, will conclude the Winters family story. However, Rose was not always going to be the focus of this story DLC. Instead, Capcom also had ideas for a Chris Redfield focused expansion.

Thankfully, Microsoft has heard your calls - over the noise of their own Xbox consoles, presumably - and is implementing an option to mute startup sounds entirely. Yes, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that Xbox swoosh to shoosh.


The choice of a silent startup is available now to those in Microsoft&#x27;s Alpha test ring for Xbox system software, meaning everyone else will likely follow suit within the next month.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s head of PlayStation Indies Shuhei Yoshida has said PS Plus should be used by publishers to manage the lifecycle of a game.


Speaking at GI Live: London (thanks GamesIndustry.biz), Yoshida discussed Sony&#x27;s approach to a subscription service, reiterating that the company still believes in the &quot;premium release of a title at launch&quot;.



Yet with PS Plus, Sony is offering a different approach as added value to developers and publishers.

                              <span>Developer Asobo has released its latest Sim Update for the majestic Microsoft Flight Simulator, this one bringing, among other things, long-awaited DLSS support for PC.


Alongside DLSS anti-aliasing and upscaling, Asobo says Sim Update 10 should deliver &quot;stability, performance, and memory usage&quot; improvements for those using Flight Simulator&#x27;s in-development Direct X12 support - although it notes the new memory allocator will only be activated once Nvidia&#x27;s next GPU driver is released.


Elsewhere in today&#x27;s update, moving boats in the world now have a wake effect on PC, there&#x27;s a new cloud layer system - said to provide &quot;more vertical precision at low altitudes to better reflect the various cloud altitudes and thickness close to the ground&quot; - plus a number of quality of life features for Flight Simulator&#x27;s VFR map.

                              <span>Developer Jupiter has unveiled an eighth mainline instalment for its mighty Picross puzzle series on Switch, its big new addition being multiplayer support for up to four player when it launches next week. Furthermore, multiplayer and touchscreen support are reportedly being added to all previous Switch instalments at the same time.


Picross S8, as this newest entry is known, follows the same familiar formula as its predecessors - each stage requiring players to complete a picture on a grid by solving numerical clues indicating which squares must be filled in - but adds a bit of spice to proceedings by letting four players put their heads together to tackle each challenge.


According to the official Picross website, it&#x27;s local multiplayer only (the trailer suggests there&#x27;s a score-based component despite everyone working co-operatively to complete the same puzzle), and each player will need their own controller to participate.

                              <span>Gearbox has called the release of Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands a &quot;great victory&quot; for the studio, saying its success means it &quot;now clearly [has] a new franchise on its hands&quot;, with more &quot;experiences&quot; already in development.


Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands released back in March, taking the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2&#x27;s much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep and building it out into a full-length game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


It was generally well-received by critics on release - Eurogamer called it &quot;endearing&quot; despite its &quot;hodgepodge design&quot; - and it&#x27;s apparently been enough of a commercial success that Gearbox is now eager to do more.

                              <span>A month after Dark Souls 3&#x27;s Steam servers were finally bought online following more than seven months of downtime, they&#x27;re offline again, with publisher Bandai Namco confirming it&#x27;s currently &quot;investigating&quot; the issue.


The Dark Souls server woes began in January, when Bandai Namco was forced to disable servers for all Dark Souls games following reports of serious security concerns. Although the publisher described the situation as &#x27;temporary&#x27; at the time, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3&#x27;s servers finally coming back online at the end of August.


Unfortunately, the celebrations have been short-lived, and the game&#x27;s PvP servers are, as of yesterday, once again unavailable, preventing players from accessing any of its online features.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve long felt miffed by the Xbox Elite controller&#x27;s lack of chameleon-like powers, you&#x27;re (sort of) in luck; among other things, September&#x27;s newly released Xbox update gives Elite owners the option to imbue its central button with the glowing LED colour of their dreams.


Customisation options for the Elite Wireless Controller Series 2&#x27;s Xbox button can be found in the latest version of the Xbox Accessories app on console and PC while a controller is connected. Here, users can visit the Colour tab to tinker with the Xbox button&#x27;s brightness, or use the menu sliders to pick one out of a possible 16 million hues.


In addition to button customisation, September&#x27;s Xbox update brings a revamp to the &#x27;My games and apps&#x27; Full library view on consoles, streamlining access to all games available to install and play. Furthermore, &#x27;All games&#x27; now displays every title a user has access to, including those on Game Pass, EA Access, and those claimed via Games with Gold.

                              <span>A cheat seller being sued by Bungie has launched a remarkable countersuit which claims Bungie hacked it.


The claim follows months of legal back and forth between cheat seller AimJunkies and Destiny developer Bungie, which has seen the former accused of both trademark and copyright infringement. 


AimJunkies has previously attempted to shrug off these claims, but has now gone one further. As reported by Torrentfreak, the cheat seller has now launched a countersuit which alleges Bungie accessed its computers for anti-cheat purposes via &quot;clandestine surveillance&quot; - effectively, that Bungie hacked it.

Call of the Sea - which initially launched for PC and consoles at the tail-end of 2020 - tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One&#x27;s Cissy Jones), as she investigates a beautiful South Pacific island, circa 1934, in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a captivating, often ingenious blend of story, exploration, and puzzling that successfully hits some powerful emotional beats even as it tips gently into cosmic weirdness.

                              <span>Tooting up a storm on the internet is the recently released Trombone Champ.

It&#x27;s a music rhythm game where you play a trombone. Sounds simple, right?

You&#x27;d be wrong. Even though there&#x27;s some of the most famous classical pieces included, like Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony and Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, and even the national anthem, no amount of music knowledge will save you here.

                              <span>Embracer co-founder Lars Wingefors has spoken to investors about the release of Saints Row, admitting he had hoped the game would have received a &quot;greater reception&quot;.


Wingefors, whose company owns Saints Row developer Volition, acknowledged that views on the series&#x27; reboot had been &quot;polarised&quot; following its bug-laced release - in Eurogamer&#x27;s Saints Row review, Vikki Blake noted that its &#x27;Unto the Breach&#x27; mission was unplayable for her.


&quot;There are a lot of things that could be said and details around it. I&#x27;m happy to see a lot of gamers and fans happy. At the same time I&#x27;m a bit sad to see fans also not happy,&quot; Lars told investors (via Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo).

                              <span>Afghanistan has become the latest in a string of countries to ban PUBG, with the game now expected to be made unplayable in the country within the next 90 days. 


Writing on Twitter, the director of the ruling Taliban government&#x27;s media and information centre stated that the game would be blocked, alongside social app TikTok, for its effects on young people (thanks, PCGamesN). 


India, Pakistan, China and Jordan have also previously banned PUBG, whose mobile version specifically became particularly popular in these countries.

For the first time ever, it offers a new perspective: players can explore the worlds as animals such as a penguin, bumblebee, and polar bear.


Players are tasked with documenting key animal behaviour to inform environmental research, mimicking that of natural history film-making researchers.

                              <span>Nvidia is releasing Portal with RTX, which will see the game&#x27;s graphics reimagined &quot;with full ray tracing and entirely new art evocative of the original.&quot;


In a detailed blog post, Nvidia stated that &quot;full ray tracing&quot; will mean every level will be transformed. Light will now bounce around the settings, and &quot;be affected by the scene&#x27;s geometry and materials&quot;. Meanwhile, where shadows are being cast, these will be &quot;pixel perfect&quot;.


&quot;Portal&#x27;s unique selling point is the ability to take anything through a portal, and see through them, something that hadn&#x27;t been done before its release,&quot; Nvidia elaborated. &quot;With ray tracing, light can pass through portals, too. Even the light from the moving High Energy Pellets will cast through portals, causing shadows to shift in step.&quot; You can see a little preview of Portal with RTX below.

                              <span>UPDATE: Warner Bros. Games has responded to Eurogamer with a statement in response to previous investigations into sexual harassment at the studio. Below in full: 
&quot;Investigations found there was no evidence substantiating the allegations of this former employee who resigned in 2019. We stand against all forms of harassment and take any allegation extremely seriously. We support those who have concerns they wish to raise. We therefore took the necessary time to thoroughly investigate allegations at Rocksteady Studios with the utmost integrity. 
&quot;An external, independent law firm conducted a full and thorough investigation, including interviewing current and former employees, not only researching past allegations, but also examining the current culture of the studio. Furthermore, a Warner Bros. Discovery (then Warner Media) People Relations team, independent of the games division, diligently researched and investigated any allegations raised.

                              <span>New footage filmed on the show floor of E3 1999 has been posted on YouTube, and gives us one of the closest looks yet at the cut &quot;Perfect Head&quot; feature from N64 gem Perfect Dark.

Perfect Head would have allowed players to scan a face into the game using the camera on a Game Boy, which could then be mapped onto a multiplayer character&#x27;s head. The feature was complete and functional, but was removed from the game for its release. 

In an 2020 interview conducted by our own Wesley Yin-Poole, several of the developers revealed it had been removed at Nintendo&#x27;s request due to the recent Columbine High School massacre and concerns over the feature&#x27;s potential uses.

                              <span>A new and detailed report by Bloomberg has highlighted the numbers of children who stream on Twitch, and the number of accounts linked to adult predators who follow and interact with them.


Research includes various examples of children being asked by adult users to engage in explicit or inappropriate activities and perform dances or &quot;dares&quot; while live-streaming. After said streams have ended, the recordings are often viewed by hundreds of other accounts - far more than expected for small channels their size.


The report suggests this is due to &quot;hundreds&quot; of accounts believed to be used by predators, which have collated follower lists each with &quot;more than 1000 kids on their following lists&quot;.

                              <span>An artist has taken some of the most popular games today, including God of War, Resident Evil Village and Uncharted 4, and mocked them up to have PlayStation 1 inspired covers.


This series of images was shared on Reddit by user M_S_1.


M_S_1 said they took inspiration from the featured games&#x27; concept art for their covers, calling it &quot;a bit more timeless&quot; to work from. &quot;A character render with modern graphics would look pretty jarring for the era,&quot; they explained.

                              <span>Twitch has declined to change the revenue split for streamers, despite over 22k votes on its UserVoice platform.


The revenue split between Twitch and streamers has long been an issue, with many claiming the current 50/50 split is stifling the growth of smaller channels.


The UserVoice post, begun by streamer SaltyWyvern in 2020, became the most voted issue on the platform as it requested Twitch change the revenue split to 70/30 (like main rival YouTube). This has now been closed by Twitch.

The highlight here is Infinity Ward&#x27;s explanation for Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s divisive mini-map, which has come under fire from some players for failing to provide enough information on enemy players.


Unlike some previous Call of Duty games, Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s mini-map only shows enemy player dots when a UAV is active. This means it does not display red dots when enemy players sprint or fire their weapons.

Vlambeer co-founder Rami Ismail was among those who spoke out about the game, and who shared a detailed thread of criticism posted on ResetEra.


&quot;Why don&#x27;t you for once just hire some Arabs [and] locals to ensure the places you seem to insist you gotta blow us up in would at least pass the critical gaze of say, a three-year-old,&quot; Ismail wrote on Twitter. &quot;This is embarrassing to game development as a whole.&quot;

                              <span>Co-operative time-travel puzzler The Past Within - the latest entry in developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s wonderfully sinister puzzle-adventure series - finally has a release date and will be coming to PC, Mac, iOS, and Android on 2nd November.


Developer Rusty Lake has released 14 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner to date - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - each delivering a deliciously surreal, narratively interconnected slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant.


The Past Within is Rusty Lake&#x27;s first attempt at a co-operative adventure, expanding the series&#x27; familiar formula, both spacially and temporally, as two players work together across different timelines - one located in the past, the other in the future - to solve the mysteries surrounding recurring series character Albert Vanderboom.

                              <span>Over the weekend, Rockstar faced a massive leak that saw numerous screenshots and videos taken from GTA 6&#x27;s development show up online with missing assets and features.


On seeing this leaked footage, some corners of the internet decided to use it as ammunition to criticise Rockstar&#x27;s unfinished work.


&quot;If you knew how game development goes, you&#x27;d know that visuals are one of the first things done. This game is four years into planning and development. What you see is almost exactly what you will get. The next year is mission coding and debugging. All backend stuff. It does look ass,&quot; claimed one Twitter user.

The new policy prohibits streaming of gambling sites that include slots, roulette, or dice games that aren&#x27;t licensed in the US or &quot;other jurisdictions that provide sufficient consumer protection&quot; from 18th October.


This follows strike threats from some of the biggest Twitch streamers after former Team Liquid member ItsSliker admitted to have scammed viewers and fellow streamers out of $200k to fund his gambling addiction.

Allen gained brief internet fame by leaking details of Ubisoft&#x27;s various Assassin&#x27;s Creed announcements - details which he had been given by Ubisoft itself to prepare content while under embargo.


But his identity as &quot;TheRealInsider&quot; was exposed over the weekend, when Allen replied to a tweet from a fan from his main account instead. Allen then swiftly deleted the tweet, the insider account, and subsequently issued a brief Twitter statement saying sorry.

                              <span>This is a fascinating glimpse of the future of automatic cheating detection in sports:
Maybe you heard about the truly insane false-start controversy in track and field? Devon Allen—a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles—was disqualified from the 110-meter hurdles at the World Athletics Championships a few weeks ago for a false start.
Here’s the problem: You can’t see the false start. Nobody can see the false start. By sight, Allen most definitely does not leave before the gun.
But here’s the thing: World Athletics has determined that it is not possible for someone to push off the block within a tenth of a second of the gun without false starting. They have science that shows it is beyond human capabilities to react that fast. Of course there are those (I’m among them) who would tell you that’s nonsense, that’s pseudoscience, there’s no way that they can limit human capabilities like that. There is science that shows it is humanly impossible to hit a fastball. There was once science that showed human beings could not run a four-minute mile...</span>

Kubernetes v1.25, released earlier this month, introduced a new feature
that lets your cluster expand storage volumes, even when access to those
volumes requires a secret (for example: a credential for accessing a SAN fabric)
to perform node expand operation. This new behavior is in alpha and you
must enable a feature gate (CSINodeExpandSecret) to make use of it.
You must also be using CSI
storage; this change isn&#x27;t relevant to storage drivers that are built in to Kubernetes.
To turn on this new, alpha feature, you enable the CSINodeExpandSecret feature
gate for the kube-apiserver and kubelet, which turns on a mechanism to send secretRef
configuration as part of NodeExpansion by the CSI drivers thus make use of
the same to perfor…</span>

                              <span>Star Citizen, the controversial space sim from developer Cloud Imperium Games, has now raised more than half a billion dollars in funding from backers.


Star Citizen&#x27;s exceedingly lengthy development is well-documented, with the game still in alpha over a decade after production began. And while it&#x27;s attracted some private funding in that time, the overwhelming bulk has come via crowdfunding, beginning with a successful $2m USD Kickstarter in 2012 and ballooning from there.


As of today, Star Citizen has amassed $500,075,150 USD in crowdfunding from a total of 4,096,384 backers, according to the official Roberts Space Industries website. Its previous major milestone of $400m USD raised was reached last November, meaning it&#x27;s taken a further ten months to accrue an additional $100m.

                              <span>Apple has announced it will be raising its App Store prices in multiple territories - including every country that uses the euro, but excluding the UK at present - starting on 5th October.


As per an update shared with developers, which did not provide an explanation for the impending price hike, Apple said the move will impact all tiers of its App Store pricing chart in the following areas: Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Vietnam, and all territories that use the euro currency. 


When the pricing changes come into effect on 5th October, App Store items previously priced at €0.99 will, for instance, increase to €1.19, while apps formerly costing €9.99 will rise to €11.99. App Store developers who offer subscriptions will, however, have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.

                              <span>If FIFA 23&#x27;s 700+ plus real-life football clubs somehow aren&#x27;t enough to be getting on with, it looks like you&#x27;ll soon be able to sling a decidedly more imaginary one onto the pile, with all signs pointing to an appearance from Ted Lasso&#x27;s AFC Richmond in this year&#x27;s game.


Hints of an impending crossover with the award-winning Apple TV+ comedy series first emerged last week, when a listing for AFC Richmond - the fictional London team managed by Ted Lasso in the show - briefly appeared on EA&#x27;s FIFA ratings database  before being removed.


That might have been the end of it, but now the official Ted Lasso Twitter account has shared an image showing what appears to be Ted Lasso actor Jason Sudeikis, albeit from behind, ensconced in the FIFA team&#x27;s facial capture rig - used to digitise the real-world likeness of players (and, for the first time this year, managers) for use in-game.

                              <span>Earlier today, Nvidia finally revealed the new RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 video cards, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. We&#x27;ve been hands-on with the RTX 4090 for the last few days and we&#x27;re hard at work on content focusing on the firm&#x27;s latest AI-based frame generation technology - DLSS 3.
First impressions on the RTX 4090 itself though? It&#x27;s easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we&#x27;ve seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you&#x27;re one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.
We were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we&#x27;re not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we&#x27;ve put together a teaser video showing some of the work we&#x27;ve already done.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s new season is now underway, after kicking off on Sunday with a fresh cinematic that finally unmasks Brie Larson as a key character. 


For several months now, Larson has been voicing the role of Paradigm, one of the game&#x27;s heroic Seven. The Captain Marvel actress debuted as Paradigm in Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 3 Season 2 live event, where she commanded players as they took control of the game&#x27;s infamous bear mech. 


Larson has regularly popped up since, voicing audio logs and mission chatter for Fortnite&#x27;s weekly tasks through the recently-concluded Chapter 3 Season 3. Now, with the launch of Season 4, we&#x27;ve seen her with her helmet off for the first time.

Nintendo Minute was a weekly series which ended in December 2021. The show was hosted by former PR managers for Nintendo of America Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang. Since Nintendo Minute ended, the pair both left Nintendo and went on to create their own podcast.

In episode 31 of Kit and Krysta Podcast, when responding to questions submitted through Patreon, Ellis and Yang recalled a time when they had brought up the idea of a Nuzlocke run to The Pokémon Company.

This trailer sees everyone&#x27;s favourite blue blur being incredibly blue and blurry as he makes his way through the world. Oh, and Shadow and Doctor Eggman are also hot on his heels. 


Along with this teaser, which you can see below, Sega has assured us that Sonic will &quot;shatter&quot; our worlds when Sonic Prime airs this winter on Netflix. And yes, I feel quite agitated writing about a Netflix show with the word &#x27;Prime&#x27; in its title.

                              <span>Nvidia has announced its latest generation of GeForce RTX graphics cards at its GTC AI conference. The Nvidia RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are the first GPUs from the &#x27;Ada Lovelace&#x27; series, and they should be up to twice as fast as their last-gen counterparts in rasterised games - and up to four times as fast in ray-traced games.  
The RTX 4090 24GB will be available on October 12th and costs $1599/£1679, while the RTX 4080 16GB arrives in November and costs $1199/£1269. There&#x27;s also an RTX 4080 12GB model that costs $899/£949. The 4090 and 4080 are reportedly two to four times faster than their Ampere equivalents, which are the 3090 Ti and the 3080 Ti, respectively. 
Note that Nvidia RTX 30-series cards will remain on sale for the moment, filling in the bottom part of the market until lower-tier RTX 40-series GPUs arrive.

                              <span>EA has confirmed it is developing a single-player third-person action adventure Iron Man game as part of a new collaboration between it and Marvel for &quot;several&quot; new projects.


The game - which is yet to be titled - is in the works at Star Wars Squadrons studio Motive, which is also developing the upcoming Dead Space remake.


The project still seems some way off, and EA lists it as in pre-production. As with other recent early announcements, the confirmation appears to have been made to spur recuitment on the game (and also follows earlier whispers of its existence).

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man made its way to PC earlier in the year, and along with it a multitude of mods have swung onto the scene. 


Now, one such mod has given the game a literal face lift, by replacing the new model of Peter Parker with that of the game&#x27;s original PlayStation 4 one. 


This mod was uploaded to Nexus mods by DaigronCDM. Known as the &#x27;John Bubniak - PS4 face restoration mod&#x27;, it does exactly as you&#x27;d expect. It makes Peter Parker look more like John Bubniak, Spidey&#x27;s original face model before the character was redesigned to look more like actor Yuri Lowenthal.

                              <span>Microsoft has ditched its online checks for Xbox One discs when playing on an Xbox Series X.
The online requirements for Xbox games have previously come under fire for being unclear and rendering downloaded and offline games unplayable during service outages. 

Microsoft has recently made a quiet change to the checks made when launching games on Xbox Series X. For anyone making good use of the Series X&#x27;s backwards compatibility, there are now no online DRM checks for Xbox One discs. (Of course, this was not an issue on the disc-less Series S.)

This mechanic, spotted by VGC, now offers players the opportunity to switch game regions from 50Hz PAL (a notably slower standard) to NTSC 60Hz through Syphon Filter 2&#x27;s settings menu.


You can see how this process looks in the image below.

Of course, this batch is undoubtedly headlined by the long-awaited arrival of Deathloop, the full version of Grounded, and indie hit Valheim on PC.


Parents and the young at heart may also be pleased to see new release Paw Patrol Grand Prix is also part of this latest update. The popular pups&#x27; take on Mario Kart joins Game Pass next week.

&quot;There are also reports over the weekend that this same actor breached video game maker Rockstar Games,&quot; Uber wrote in a newly-updated blog. &quot;We are in close coordination with the FBI and US Department of Justice on this matter and will continue to support their efforts.&quot;

Valve has announced it has &quot;beaten [its] own estimates yet again&quot; thanks to &quot;increased production&quot;. 


As a result, it has now sent out all its emails to those in the Q3 bracket of reservations, and is now getting a headstart on those in Q4.

Butterfly Soup 2 is due to launch on 29th October, and will follow the four main characters a few months after the original story.

We&#x27;ve previously featured Butterfly Soup in a piece by Natalie Flores on the humanisation of queer women through humour in games, and Butterfly Soup has this in spades.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s Shadows of Rose DLC will serve as Capcom&#x27;s final act for the Winters family, the publisher has said.


Talking to IGN, Director Kento Kinoshita stated Capcom is &quot;creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga.&quot;


This means any future entries to the series will likely introduce us to a new set of characters or bring back some older faces from the previous generations of games - though Capcom itself is tight-lipped on any further details.

                              <span>EA boss Andrew Wilson has suggested the ongoing drama surrounding the future of Call of Duty is &quot;a tremendous opportunity&quot; for his company&#x27;s beleagured Battlefield franchise.


Wilson issued the comment at a financial event organised by Goldman Sachs (transcribed by Seeking Alpha), where he contrasted Call of Duty&#x27;s situation with that of Battlefield - the latter of which, he boasted, was &quot;platform agnostic&quot;.


&quot;In a world where there may be questions over the future of Call of Duty and what platforms that might be on or might not be on, being platform agnostic and completely cross-platform with Battlefield, I think is a tremendous opportunity,&quot; Wilson said.

                              <span>More leaked footage from Diablo 4 has found its way onto the internet, adding to the blizzard being faced by Blizzard.


As with previous leaks from August, this footage appears to have originated from the ongoing Friend and Family beta version of the game - something that is labelled as a &quot;private test build&quot;. 


The latest leaks were uploaded to reddit and show a total of 43 minutes of gameplay footage. This  work-in-progress  footage includes the map, various cosmetic options and a variety of attacks - though is all subject to change before the release of the full game.

The report, by Insider Gaming, suggests the console will otherwise have near-identical hardware to current PS5 models, with the only difference being the removable drive itself, and an extra USB-C port for it to plug in.


There&#x27;s also the suggestion this new console will be sold both on its own and with the detachable disc drive included.

Allen recently gathered some online clout around the fact he had posted, under the alias The Real Insider, details of the various Assassin&#x27;s Creed games Ubisoft was set to announce during its event last week. 


How did Allen know these details? He had been pre-briefed by Ubisoft itself on the contents of its presentation under embargo - which he then promptly ignored and wrote anonymously about on the internet.

                              <span>Rockstar has acknowledged the enormous Grand Theft Auto 6 leak of work-in-progress development materials that took place over the weekend.
In a statement published this afternoon on Twitter, as the company returned to work, Rockstar admitted it had suffered a &quot;network intrusion&quot; - a hack - from which the early development footage of GTA 6 had been taken.
Rockstar said it hoped the hack would have no impact on its live services - such as GTA Online - and insisted the leak would not impact the development of the game long-term. Still, Rockstar acknowleged it was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; at what had happened.

                              <span>The Washington Post is reporting that the US Customs and Border Protection agency is seizing and copying cell phone, tablet, and computer data from “as many as” 10,000 phones per year, including an unspecified number of American citizens. This is done without a warrant, because “…courts have long granted an exception to border authorities, allowing them to search people’s devices without a warrant or suspicion of a crime.”
CBP’s inspection of people’s phones, laptops, tablets and other electronic devices as they enter the country has long been a controversial practice that the agency has defended as a low-impact way to pursue possible security threats and determine an individual’s “intentions upon entry” into the U.S. But the revelation that thousands of agents have access to a searchable database without public oversight is a new development in what privacy advocates and some lawmakers warn could be an infringement of Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures...</span>

Local ephemeral storage capacity isolation was introduced as a alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.7 and it went beta in 1.9. With Kubernetes 1.25 we are excited to announce general availability(GA) of this feature.
Pods use ephemeral local storage for scratch space, caching, and logs. The lifetime of local ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the individual pod. It is exposed to pods using the container’s writable layer, logs directory, and EmptyDir volumes. Before this feature was introduced, there were issues related to the lack of local storage accounting and isolation, such as Pods not knowing how much local storage is available and being unable to request guaranteed local storage.

                              <span>343 Industries has confirmed its withdrawing the dedicated playlist for Halo Infinite mode Land Grab.

In a brief statement about it on Halo Waypoint, 343i said that whilst it knew &quot;many players have enjoyed this new mode&quot;, it had been &quot;steadily declining&quot; and &quot;starting to fall short of the quality bar&quot;. Consequently, the dedicated playlist will be &quot;rotated out&quot; and will instead &quot;roll into Quick Play&quot; at the beginning of November.

&quot;On Tuesday, Sept. 20, the dedicated Land Grab playlist will be rotated out of matchmaking,&quot; the blog post reveals. &quot;While we know many players have enjoyed this new mode introduced in Season 2, at this stage it’s been steadily declining and starting to fall short of the quality bar for a positive player experience.

This means that new games coming to what would&#x27;ve been the &quot;Yakuza&quot; series will carry the &quot;Like a Dragon&quot; name instead.

Confirmation comes by way of Sega, which confirmed to Kotaku that as the Like a Dragon branding is &quot;more closely align with the Japanese name&quot;, it is formally dropping the Yakuza name from every new title going forward.

&quot;Wizard101 servers have been temporarily shut down due to an unexpected issue,&quot; the company tweeted yesterday. &quot;We will keep everyone updated on when they will be back up. Thank you for your patience.&quot;

Though not set in stone, of course, producer/director Naoki Yoshida spoke at Tokyo Games Show and teased that Square Enix will &quot;probably release the trailer next month&quot;.

“I haven’t gotten a chance to talk to the marketing or public relations teams at all, so I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say, but I think we’ll probably be able to release the next trailer next month or so,&quot; Yoshida said (thanks, Gematsu).

Steamforged Games - the team behind the Horizon Zero Dawn, Resident Evil, and Dark Souls tabletop games - will be launching a Kickstarter campaign &quot;soon&quot; to bring the officially-sanctioned board game adaptation to fruition. 

&quot;Like the video game, the Elden Ring board game will immerse players in the forsaken Lands Between,&quot; explains a press release from the company. &quot;In a vast, sprawling world of decaying grandeur that unfolds through their exploration, 1-4 ‘Tarnished’ players will embark on a huge and varied adventure, visiting iconic locations and crossing paths with familiar enemies and characters.&quot;

                              <span>90+ screenshots and videos reportedly taken from GTA 6 have leaked online.

Whilst there&#x27;s no way of authenticating them, the initially hostile response on the GTA Forums eventually softened as posters began to believe that the leaked assets were genuine.

Whilst, naturally, the unfinished game has missing assets and features, the videos give a rudimentary peek at the protagonists, the open world, and even the shooter&#x27;s combat, totalling over seven minutes&#x27; worth of unsanctioned footage.

It&#x27;s been three years since Spencer first mentioned plans to bring Square Enix&#x27;s fan-favourite MMO to Xbox and while there&#x27;s been no movement, Spencer gave &quot;a commitment&quot; that the company was still trying to make it happen.

&quot;Hahaha, I did say that,&quot; he laughed when asked by Game Watch if he remembered talking about it way back in 2019.

                              <span>Valve is showing off Steam Deck&#x27;s unreleased dock at Tokyo Game Show.

Though the Steam Deck Steam page mentions the dock and still invites interested players to wishlist the item, we&#x27;ve not seen nor heard much about it since Valve began shipping its sought-after handheld system.

As spotted by NME, Valve has the dock on display at Tokyo Game Show, giving fans a chance to check out the new kit and count - and argue about - those all-important ports on the back, which crucially  seem to show just one USB-C port, which is for the power cable.

                              <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn has nerfed the Heat Sink skin iron sights and says it is &quot;improving the competitive integrity of iron sights now and in the future&quot;.

In an update posted to the game&#x27;s official website (via Reddit), Respawn responded to players&#x27; reports that some of the battle royale&#x27;s weapon skins offered an unfair competitive advantage when aiming down sights.

&quot;Competitive integrity is and will always be a core pillar for Apex Legends,&quot; Respawn said. &quot;As part of that, our default iron sights are designed to push players to loot for better optics. We also believe that skins shouldn&#x27;t be a factor in the sights functionality as well.

“No, [Western players] don’t really watch subtitled content,&quot; Yokoyama acknowledged in the interview (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;Especially in English speaking countries. That’s why they prefer to have voice overs.

The new &quot;special collaboration&quot; with McLaren will run until 1st November for PC players and 9th for those PUBG-ing on console, and introduce a load of McLaren flavoured goodies, including a McLaren GT Standard - Onyx Black vehicle skin, costume, gear, emote, and &quot;more via in-game McLaren Loot Caches&quot;.

Players can also tart up the Coupe RB with McLaren skins &quot;through the new vehicle interaction feature&quot; although fair warning: the skins &quot;do not affect the performance of the vehicle&quot;. Sorry.

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment head and Battlefield franchise boss Vince Zampella has spoken about the reception - and failure - of the series&#x27; most recent entry, Battlefield 2042, suggesting it &quot;strayed too far from&quot; its roots.


Battlefield 2042 was dogged by technical issues and controversial design decisions when it launched last year, quickly attracting overwhelmingly negative reviews from players on Steam.


Since then, developer DICE has continued to tweak and expand on Battlefield 2042&#x27;s wobbly base, but it&#x27;s often felt like too little, too late - with publisher EA admitting the game&#x27;s sales &quot;did not meet expectations&quot;, saying, &quot;Some of the design choices we made...did not resonate with everyone in our community&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has revealed its upcoming PSVR2 headset for PlayStation 5 won&#x27;t be compatible with games for the original PSVR.


That&#x27;s according to PlayStation&#x27;s SVP of platform experience, Hideaki Nishino, speaking in the latest episode of the Official PlayStation Podcast (jump to the 29:10 mark). &quot;PSVR games are not compatible with PSVR2,&quot; he explained in answer to a question from the host, &quot;because PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next-generation VR experience&quot;. 


Elaborating further, Nishino claimed the new elements of the PVSR2 hardware - inside-out tracking and eye-tracking, 3D audio, a 4K HDR display, and its controller with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback - meant &quot;developing games for PSVR2 requires a whole different approach than the original PSVR.&quot;

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 closed beta announcement, Capcom has now revealed the full 18-strong character roster coming to the fighting series&#x27; latest instalment on launch day.


Previously, Capcom had confirmed 11 of the characters set to be playable in Street Fighter 6, offering a mix of familiar faces and brand-new additions. The iconic likes of Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, and Guile were all confirmed to be in, alongside more recent additions Juri and Luke. And as for newcomers, &quot;self-styled Chinatown peacekeeper&quot; Jamie and &quot;devoted student to Bushinryu&quot; Kimberly were both confirmed to be along for the ride.


As of today, though, that earlier 11-strong line-up has seen seven more additions, with Capcom having now announced Street Fighter 6&#x27;s full launch day roster. Series stalwarts Zangief, Cammy, and Dee Jay are all present and correct, and the list of newcomers is complete with Manon, Marisa, Lily, and JP.

                              <span>There&#x27;s good news for PlayStation-owning fans of developer Team Cherry&#x27;s sublime Metroidvania, Hollow Knight. Its feverishly anticipated sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, has finally been confirmed for release on PS4 and PS5.


Hollow Knight: Silksong has, of course, been a long time coming, with Team Cherry first announcing the game all the way back in February 2019. Even now, some three and a half years later, specifics around Silksong remain limited, but we do at least know it&#x27;ll offer a twist on its predecessor&#x27;s non-linear exploration, platforming, and combat thanks to a new protagonist, Hornet, with her own distinct abilities.


Given how very excellent the original Hollow Knight was, that&#x27;s still more than enough to warrant excitement, and Switch, Xbox, and PC players have been able to rest easy knowing Silksong would - eventually, at least - be available on their system to play.

                              <span>After nearly eight years in development, an ambitious VR mod for Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter Half-Life 2 finally launches on Steam today as a public beta.


Created by a group of modders going by the name of Source VR Mod Team, Half-Life 2: VR Mod has had a bit of a bumpy journey to release. Eurogamer first reported on the project back in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra in 2013. Some time after, it disappeared into what the team recently called &quot;its own kind of development hell&quot;, almost being abandoned, but eventually re-emerged in 2021.


The wait continued until last month, when Source VR Mod Team announced that, thanks to a &quot;new influx of team members [that] revitalised&quot; development, the Half-Life 2: VR project was poised to release, and that day is now here.

                              <span>The hype around the recently announced Like a Dragon: Ishin! remake is very real, and two new trailers from Sega show off the upgraded graphics, plus what new content has been added by developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.

There are two new trailers for us to digest, so let&#x27;s get into it!

A gameplay trailer, posted on the Japanese Like a Dragon YouTube channel, focuses on Ryoma Sakamoto&#x27;s (or Kazuma Kiryu&#x27;s historical counterpart) fighting styles (embedded below).

                              <span>Nintendo finally confirmed the title of its Breath of the Wild sequel this week - after previously saying it was keeping the name secret as it was too much of a spoiler. 


The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was named on screen during the latest Nintendo Direct - but many fans still had questions.


Namely, was that &quot;tears&quot; as in crying? Or &quot;tears&quot; as in something being torn up?

                              <span>We learned this week that brilliant GameCube role-playing game Tales of Symphonia was getting a re-release on modern consoles - but fans have now expressed disappointment at the fact it will run at a locked 30fps. 


The detail, listed on the game&#x27;s new Japanese website, has raised eyebrows since Symphonia on GameCube was presented in largely 60fps (with 30fps only for the world map).


Instead, this new remaster features a blanket 1080p 30fps across all three platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a blockbuster week thanks to Tokyo Game Show 2022 and showcases from the likes of Nintendo and Sony.

With so many announcements, it&#x27;s easy to get lost in what&#x27;s already out and what&#x27;s available when. 

Here&#x27;s a quick reminder of everything new that was announced for Game Pass this week.

                              <span>A mod for Cyberpunk 2077 enables Night City&#x27;s vehicles to take to the skies.


The mod in question comes from Jack Humbert on Nexus Mods (via PC Gamer). Named &#x27;Let there be flight&#x27;, this mod &quot;enables a configurable flight system for all vehicles with custom thruster models, visual &amp; sound effects, and animations.&quot;


This adds something to Cyberpunk 2077 that many had hoped would have been included on the game&#x27;s initial release almost two years ago.

Speaking overnight to CNBC, Spencer noted the current economic issues many were facing, and said Xbox didn&#x27;t think it &quot;was the right move for us at this point&quot; to follow suit.


&quot;In a time when our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right move for us at this point to be raising prices on our consoles,&quot; Spencer said.

                              <span>Indie tycoon game Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo will be making its way to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox via Game Pass on 29th September.


&quot;It&#x27;s time to Build a Zoo,&quot; reads the press release. &quot;Construct and decorate enclosures, buy and breed animals, hire zookeepers and vets... then try your hand at DNA splicing, and stitch together over 500,000 different types of animal. This can only go smoothly...&quot;


Splicing, did you say? Well, yes, yes I did! In Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, players can quite literally mix things up during any given playthrough. On its console release, new players will be able to exhibit a whole myriad of unusual beings. After all, who wouldn&#x27;t want to see a crocoduck if the opportunity presented itself.

                              <span>As the spat intensifies between Sony and Microsoft over the latter&#x27;s impending Activision Blizzard buyout, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has given his thoughts on the matter to US TV.


Spencer appeared on CNBC overnight and was questioned over Sony&#x27;s recent comments on the deal - including pushback from PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who previously branded Microsoft&#x27;s reassurances around the future of Call of Duty as &quot;inadequate&quot;. 


When asked whether Microsoft was prepared to go further than its recently-stated pledge - to keep COD on PlayStation for several more years - and perhaps promise it would remain on PlayStation in perpetuity, Spencer said his expectation was that Xbox would &quot;continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation and other places&quot;.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 has been doing better on Steam recently, with a steady increase in player count now making it one of the most played single-player games on the platform. 

It feels a bit wild to be making this statement nearly two years after the game came out.

According to SteamDB, yesterday the number concurrent players in Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam peaked at 37,000, beating out Elden Ring on 31,000 and mostly topped by titles with a huge multiplayer base such as Grand Theft Auto 5 and Destiny 2.

Speaking to IGN about the upcoming game, de Fondaumiere shared that, while with each new title the studio does &quot;try to innovate&quot; and &quot;explore new ground&quot;, Quantic Dream will always retain various aspects of their games in future releases.


&quot;With Star Wars Eclipse we&#x27;re certainly going to keep the fundamental elements of a Quantic Dream game,&quot; he explained.

And they are: Earthworm Jim, Alisia Dragoon, and The Story of Thor (known as Beyond Oasis in the US).


Earthworm Jim is the most well known of these, a 90s character platformer about a humanoid worm in a space suit (look, it was the &#x27;90s...), but don&#x27;t sleep on those other two.

French publisher Microids announced the imminent release of Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission, officially licensed by Taito and due out on consoles this autumn. It&#x27;s also coming to VR in 2023.


All we have on this new game for now is a handful of screenshots, below, which show a new cartooney art style compared to the cult classic late-&#x27;80s arcade shooter. I&#x27;m sure this one&#x27;s going to prove divisive.

                              <span>Outer Wilds, the stellar time loop adventure - and Eurogamer Game of the Year 2019 - from developer Mobius Digital, has just received a next-gen upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Outer Wilds, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, casts players as tentative space explorers, slinging them into a miniature solar system of bizarre planets, absolutely stuffed with secrets. There&#x27;s little direction, only a breadcrumb trail of clues hinting at a much larger mystery, and it all gradually opens out into glorious puzzle box, as ingenious as it is hauntig. And that&#x27;s even before you start to grapple with the ramifications of the solar system resetting itself every 20 minutes.


It&#x27;s great, then, but while Outer Wilds has technically been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S before now via backward compatibility, &quot;playing...was not recommended because players could run into sections that weren’t optimised for the next-gen consoles, and encounter other backwards compatibility issues such as controller input lag&quot; - as Mobius explains in a new post.

                              <span>Capcom has shared more details on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s next free Title Update, which will introduce the likes of the Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos when it comes to Switch and PC on 29th September.


When Capcom previously discussed Title Update 2 at the end of last month, it confirmed that monster variant Flaming Espinas would be one ofits new additions. It&#x27;s now announced two additional variants for the release - the aforementioned Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos - both appering in its latest update trailer.


There&#x27;s not much information about the Violet Mizutsune just yet, but the Risen Chameleos is described as an Elder Dragon that has &quot;overcome the affliction by achieving symbiosis with the Qurio, gaining great strength and new abilities&quot;. As such, it &quot;poses an even greater danger than when they were still under the influence of the affliction&quot; - so tread carefully.

                              <span>Saturnalia - the striking multi-character survival horror from acclaimed developer Santa Ragione - finally has a release date, and will be inviting PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC players into its ever-shifting labyrinth on 27th October.


We&#x27;re big fans of Santa Ragione&#x27;s previous work, which includes MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, around these parts, and Saturnalia sounds just as intriguing. It&#x27;s a survival horror adventure, of sorts - one heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - that sees players guiding four different characters through a mysterious ancient village steeped in murky rituals.


The goal of Saturnalia is to investigate, and ultimately solve, the mystery of village, but there are shadowy things in the night determined to stop you. Should you get captured as one character, you can switch to another and attempt a rescue - but once all four characters are dead, the village gets to reassert itself, its labyrinthine layout physically reconfiguring for another attempt. Narrative and puzzle progress, however, is retained across game-overs.

                              <span>Following tonight&#x27;s big Call of Duty blowout we finally have a release date for the much-anticipated Warzone 2.0 - plus we&#x27;ve plenty more details on what to expect. 


Warzone 2.0 is set to launch on 16th November, some two weeks after the launch of Modern Warfare 2 on 28th October. The pair will share the same engine, a first for the Call of Duty franchise and one that should ensure parity and a more consistent feature set - all of which makes this feel like something of a new dawn for the series. Warzone 2.0 introduces the new desert map of Al Mazrah, plus some of its own twists on the battle royale formula such as multiple circles appearing in certain end-game scenarios. It&#x27;ll also feature a new AI faction, with Strong Holds harbouring loot patrolled by NPCs, and a tweaked Gulag system. There will also be a new sandbox mode called DMZ, and while details remain slim it does indeed sound like Warzone&#x27;s take on Escape from Tarkov. 


Like other popular battle royale titles it will also feature a third-person view - something entirely new for Warzone 2.0, and an addition that will likely be the subject of some debate. Third-person playlists will also be available in Modern Warfare 2, harking back to the third-person mode that was available in the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009.

                              <span>Lego Bricktales, the beautiful diorama-based puzzler from developer ClockStone, finally has a release date and will be coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 12th October.


Announced back in March, Lego Bricktales sees players traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they, with the assistant of a cute robot pal, embark on a quest to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


The ensuing adventure offers a blend of puzzling and questing based around Lego Bricktales&#x27; brick-by-brick building mechanic, challenging players to come up with a solution to a particular task at hand by building something from a limited number of bricks - a bridge to cross a river, for instance, or a flyable, physics-based gyrocopter.

                              <span>Norco, the acclaimed southern gothic adventure from developer Geography of Robots, will be making the jump from PC to PlayStation and Xbox next month, arriving on 20th October.


Norco unfolds in the &quot;sinking suburbs and verdant industrial swamps&quot; of a surreal, future South Louisiana, where players - in the role of a rebellious teenage girl - embark on a quest to find their brother, Blake, missing after the death of their mother.


What follows is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure, but one that aims in all sorts of directions, with Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell somewhat futilely summing it up as a &quot;text-adventure, turn-based party battler, boat-navigating... poem... puzzler?&quot; in his review.

                              <span>Capcom just announced the dates for Street Fighter 6&#x27;s upcoming closed beta test.

The dates were shown as part of Capcom&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show livestream event earlier today, which also included a new look at parts of the game and some returning fighters.

Series veterans Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim and E. Honda were all confirmed as returning characters to the roster. Footage of the Battle Hub showed a game centre full of arcade cabinets for players to compete against one another.

                              <span>We&#x27;re back again this week for another Eurogamer Newscast, focusing on the recent Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play, plus the week&#x27;s big news on the Yakuza franchise and what&#x27;s next from Xbox Game Pass. It&#x27;s been a busy week - full of Zelda, Pikmin, God of War and Yakuza 8 - but some corners of the internet are disappointed.


True, we didn&#x27;t see some of the things we had expected might materialise. This week was not when we saw Wind Waker on Switch, Silent Hill on PlayStation, or got some kind of assurance Nintendo remembered what Metroid even was. But that&#x27;s not to say there isn&#x27;t plenty to look forward to.

Join Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan for our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom theories, thoughts on new Switch hardware, and our expert opinion on where to start with Yakuza.

Along with this news, we also have a new trailer (see below) and more details about the game&#x27;s graphical adjustments and customisation options, among others.

                              <span>UPDATE 5pm UK: In a statement to Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson has addressed Sony&#x27;s statement: &quot;It makes zero business sense for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty from PlayStation given its market leading console position.&quot;

ORIGINAL STORY 4.45pm UK: 
Sony says it &quot;welcomes the announcement&quot; by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority that it will further investigate Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In a statement to GamesIndustry.Biz, the platform holder said that &quot;by giving Microsoft control of Activision games like Call of Duty, this deal would have major negative implications for gamers and the future of the gaming industry&quot;.

                              <span>At the conclusion of Resident Evil Village, it was teased that Ethan Winters&#x27; now teenage daughter could wield some impressive powers. What exactly these powers were was never disclosed, with Rose revealing that &quot;even Chris&quot; didn&#x27;t know the full extent of what she could do thanks to her brush with the megamycete. 


However, a new trailer for Village&#x27;s The Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC has shown off more from its new story, Shadows of Rose, including what these powers are.


Shared as part of Capcom&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show presentation, this trailer reveals that Rose is actually able to freeze her enemies. So, very name appropriate.

Back in June, 343 discussed the idea of introducing Spartan Points, a premium currency to unlock items within the game.


The idea was that given there are over 1000 customisation items in MCC which were added over the years, it could be overwhelming for new players or those who only hop into the game occasionally.

                              <span>Capcom has announced a last-gen PlayStation 4 version of its upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake - but will still skip the Xbox One. 


The long-rumoured Resi 4 remake was finally unveiled back in June, and was initially announced for just PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Today, during a Tokyo Games Show livestream, Capcom said it had been working on securing a last-gen version of the game as well - and it had done so, but only for PS4.

This new feature will allow users to create &quot;dedicated spaces for each new topic of discussion,&quot; Discord explains.


&quot;You&#x27;ll be able to see everything people are chatting about before you jump in, allowing you to engage in an existing discussion - or start a new one - without worrying about breaking up or getting in the way of other ongoing conversations.&quot;

                              <span>A new update for the Xbox app on PC has added official integration of website HowLongToBeat.

If you haven&#x27;t used it before, HowLongToBeat is a community run website where people can log how long it took them to beat a certain game. The times are then averaged to provide a rough estimate of the game&#x27;s expected length.

It&#x27;s by no means sound scientifically, but it&#x27;s a nifty way of ballparking how much time you might need to finish a game&#x27;s story before you commit to playing (or buying) it.

Gunsmith was first introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) as a replacement of the attachment system used in preceding titles, and it&#x27;s been used in every game since. 


The system allows players to customise their weapons in greater detail, with multiple attachments, optics and of course, skins.

Meanwhile, developer Shedworks has said, thanks to the PS5&#x27;s DualSense controller, riding over the game&#x27;s sand dunes will be &quot;as immersive as ever&quot; with this release.

The beta, which is set to go live tomorrow evening, is available to preload now for those who have pre-ordered the game. 


The most notable finding has been the option to adjust the &quot;3rd Person Field of View,&quot; which implies that the game will feature a third-person game mode, as well as an FOV slider on console.

Indeed, a Switch port of anything Yakuza is unlikely to happen, according to Ryu Ga Gotoku Sydido head Masayoshi Yokoyama.

Yokoyama made the statement in an interview with GameSpot yesterday and explained why the studio was reluctant to put Yakuza on Switch.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima is at it again.


The creator has recently set up a website, presumably for a new game, which features nothing more than a shadowy visage with the words &quot;Who Am I?&quot; written across the image.


Clicking on this image then gives you the option to share said picture across various social media feeds, something that Geoff Keighly has done. As such, the internet now expects whatever this new project of Kojima&#x27;s is to be fully unveiled at The Game Awards this December.

                              <span>The last day of Overwatch 1 will be 2nd October, Blizzard told me during an Overwatch 2 roundtable interview last night. (Note: this is from a Pacific Time point of view. With time differences, it could be 3rd October elsewhere in the world.) Overwatch 2 will then launch 4th October and be the only Overwatch game in operation.
&quot;So roughly a day before Overwatch 2 launches, we&#x27;re going to be taking down the Overwatch 1 servers,&quot; commercial lead Jon Spector explained to me. &quot;So that means, as a practical point, that October 2nd really is the last day to go in and play Overwatch 1. And then it&#x27;s a 27-hour downtime that we&#x27;re planning in order to get the Overwatch 2 server stood up and running. 
&quot;We&#x27;ll give current Overwatch players the ability to download Overwatch 2 a little bit ahead of when we launch, if they want to pre-download. There&#x27;s also a couple of things that we&#x27;ll be asking players to do, to get ready for Overwatch 2. We&#x27;ll share a kind of launch checklist with players ahead of things so that they have a smooth experience getting in on 4th October, when we launch.

The reveal came during an unusually packed Tokyo Game Show livestream from Xbox, which also included Game Pass confirmations of the Ni No Kuni series, and an Xbox release date for Deathloop.


Odyssey is the Assassin&#x27;s Creed game set in Ancient Greece, and its deepest dive into the RPG genre. It&#x27;s a warm, enjoyable and expansive experience - and one of the highlights of the whole series.

Radio relay attacks are technically complicated to execute, but conceptually easy to understand: attackers simply extend the range of your existing key using what is essentially a high-tech walkie-talkie. One thief stands near you while you’re in the grocery store, intercepting your key’s transmitted signal with a radio transceiver. Another stands near your car, with another transceiver, taking the signal from their friend and passing it on to the car. Since the car and the key can now talk, through the thieves’ range extenders, the car has no reason to suspect the key isn’t inside—and fires right up...</span>

This blog describes the two features namely minReadySeconds for StatefulSets and maxSurge for DaemonSets that SIG Apps is happy to graduate to stable in Kubernetes 1.25.
Specifying minReadySeconds slows down a rollout of a StatefulSet, when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field, by waiting for each pod for a desired time.
This time can be used for initializing the pod (e.g. warming up the cache) or as a delay before acknowledging the pod.
maxSurge allows a DaemonSet workload to run multiple instances of the same pod on a node during a rollout when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field.
This helps to minimize the downtime of the DaemonSet for consumers.
These features …</span>

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Gran Turismo movie continues to progress, with Stranger Things star David Harbour having now joined the cast.


Sony&#x27;s live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Harbour is the first member of the cast to be officially revealed (thanks The Hollywood Reporter) and he&#x27;ll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who&#x27;s helming the project.


Blomkamp will be directing from a script by Jason Hall (American Sniper) and Zach Baylin (King Richard), which dramatises an apparently true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver.

                              <span>&#x27;Tis the week of showcases, it seems, and following Nintendo and Sony&#x27;s efforts last night, Microsoft has taken its own turn today with another one of its predominantly indie-focused ID@Xbox digital showcase events. And if you missed its typically meandering reveals, you can check out everything that put in an appearance, considerably more succinctly, below.

Eville


Eville is a multiplayer social deduction game from developer VestGames that&#x27;s coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 11th October. It sees up to 13 players working together - or otherwise - in order to unmask Conspirators hiding in a village beset by murders. Those cast as Villagers must weed out the suspects by day, while those in the role of Conspirators can decide who should be bumped off next by night.

                              <span>Cities Skylines&#x27; 11th major expansion, Plazas and Promenades, has skipped the release date announcement pre-amble to surprise-launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC today.


Plazas and Promenades, which was announced back in August, brings a new pedestrianisation focus to developer Colossal Order&#x27;s acclaimed city builder, giving players the tools needed to add pedestrian-only streets, pedestrian zones, and zone-specific policies.


Pedestrian Streets can be placed like any other road to create green city centres largely free of vehicles and pollution. These work in tandem with new pedestrian zones which can be augmented with new policies, such as Slow Driving (reducing the speed limit for all vehicles in the area to 20km an hour), and Street Music, which boosts happiness in pedestrianised commercial zones at the expense of noise pollution.

This latest Marvel character to join Fortnite is one of four new skins teased today via a series of promotional images - each of which simply shows a hand reaching out of a puddle of gloop.


Fortnite&#x27;s next season is set to begin this Sunday, 18th September, as its peaceful summer party gets consumed by chrome-coloured goo.

                              <span>Eight years after its initial launch, EA&#x27;s is making its enormously popular life sim The Sims 4 permanently free-to-play, beginning Tuesday, 18th October.


From that point onward, The Sims 4&#x27;s base game (which is currently priced at £17.99/£19.99 USD) will be available to download at no cost across all platforms - that is, PC, Mac, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. There&#x27;s no talk of pricing changes for the game&#x27;s extensive DLC catalogue - which totals 12 Expansion Packs, 12 Game Packs, 18 Stuff Packs, and 15 Kit Packs at present - so it appears to be business as usual on that front for now.


In a post announcing today&#x27;s news, EA said it will &quot;continue to develop and release packs, kits and Sims Delivery Express drops into the foreseeable future&quot; following The Sims 4 base game&#x27;s transition to free-to-play, with more on its future plans set to be shared in a special developer livestream airing on 18th October at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT.

According to the official Nintendo website, you&#x27;ll play as Alear &quot;who awakens a thousand years after the war [between Elyos and the Fell Dragon] with no memory of their past&quot;. 

Perhaps that&#x27;s the in-game explanation for the odd fashion choices for Alear, then.

                              <span>Ahead of Return to Monkey Island&#x27;s release next week, I sat down with series creator Ron Gilbert, co-writer Dave Grossman and art director Rex Crowle to discuss the series&#x27; surprise revival. It&#x27;s a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years (two years!) before its April Fool&#x27;s Day announcement a few months ago. 
Speaking via video call, it was clear the trio had a great passion for what they do - and also an oversized Stan S. Stanman cutout, which loomed over Gilbert&#x27;s shoulder. (This turned out to be a prop from a recent PAX trip liberated by Gilbert, thanks to the series&#x27; iconic distraction of &quot;Look! A three-headed monkey&quot;. Apparently, this move works &quot;every time&quot;.)
In addition to sharing more about Return to Monkey Island, including details of its under-wraps hint system, we spoke about the future of the series, scrapped plans to break up Guybrush and Elaine, and even ideas for Elaine Marley to lead her own game - as well as some Monty Python influences thrown in for good measure.

Kimura plays private investigator Takayuki Yagami, the main character of the Judgment games.

The practice was previously commonplace pre-Covid, and frequently prompted outpourings of excitement at major Nintendo game reveals. 


Well, as we know, yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct had plenty of those - and the assembled group of fans reacted as well as you might expect to word of Pikmin 4, Fire Emblem Engage, and the name for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

He then launches head first through the air into the boss, followed by the game&#x27;s logo.

                              <span>Yesterday, we were all treated to a new trailer announcing the name for Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming Legend of Zelda sequel. 
Along with finally getting its name revealed - Tears of the Kingdom - we also got some new footage. And where there is new footage, you can be sure that Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and I will not be far behind with our theories about what it all means for the next instalment in the Zelda series.
So, we have teamed up to bring you our thoughts on this new trailer below - and to discuss the little things you  may have missed on a first pass. Without further ado, let&#x27;s get stuck in.

                              <span>343 Industries, the developer behind Xbox&#x27;s blockbuster Halo series, has reportedly lost another high-profile figure.


David Berger, who served as lead developer on Infinite&#x27;s ambitious Slipspace Engine technology, will leave the studio - according to reports by Windows Central and Lords of Gaming.


News of the departure comes just days after 343&#x27;s boss Bonnie Ross announced her own exit from the company after 15 years, to attend to a family medical issue.

                              <span>Yakuza fans have it pretty good right now. Like a Dragon 8 and a Kiryu spin-off just got announced, but most importantly of all, Ishin is getting not just a localisation, but a full remake and worldwide release.

For non-Yakuza fans, it looks a bit confusing. Why are we so excited about an eight year old PS3/4 game being playable in English?

To explain, we need to look back on the Yakuza series as a whole.

Titled as Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, this game will follow the story of former gangster Kiryu Kazuma from the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life up until Like a Dragon 8.

A trailer was released, showing Kiryu being disciplined at a monastery, having seemingly renounced all of his former life, before it&#x27;s revealed that Kiryu is in fact still involved with the Daidoji family from Yakuza 6.

                              <span>This year has given us a fresh bounty of farming sims to harvest.

Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct alone gave us five forthcoming farming sims: Harvestella (which now has a demo), Rune Factory 3 Special, another new Rune Factory, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, and Fae Farm. Plus Japanese Switch Online subscribers are getting N64 game Harvest Moon 64.





That&#x27;s on top of recent additions like Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Island Sanctuary mode, the quirky Ooblets, and the just-released in early access Disney Dreamlight Valley.

This is the first official reveal of Like a Dragon 8, following the brief glimpse seen in July thanks to a video from inside Sega&#x27;s offices.

The turn-based strategy game - believed to be complete and ready to launch - was pulled from release schedules earlier this year due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


Fans had hoped to see Advance Wars 1+2 reannounced during last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, though the company made no mention of it at all.

An advert for the game now appears on the Xbox dashboard with the option to pre-order now.


However, selecting the advert takes users to a blank screen as it&#x27;s not yet available on the store itself.

                              <span>Mobile tech company AppLovin has scrapped its plans to buy video game engine Unity, following a failed - and unsolicited - bid last month worth $17.5bn.


AppLovin announced it was backing off in a statement last night (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), saying it had instead decided to remain on &quot;its path as the independent market leader&quot;.


Unity rejected AppLovin&#x27;s bid within a week of it being made, and stated at the time it was &quot;not in the best interests of Unity shareholders&quot;.

Kubernetes 1.25 introduces Alpha support for a new kubelet-managed pod condition
in the status field of a pod: PodHasNetwork. The kubelet, for a worker node,
will use the PodHasNetwork condition to accurately surface the initialization
state of a pod from the perspective of pod sandbox creation and network
configuration by a container runtime (typically in coordination with CNI
plugins). The kubelet starts to pull container images and start individual
containers (including init containers) after the status of the PodHasNetwork
condition is set to True. Metrics collection services that report latency of
pod initialization from a cluster infrastructural perspective (i.e. agnostic of
per container characteristics like image size or payload) can utilize the
PodHasNe…</span>

We also got word on when we&#x27;d see the programme launch - beginning in &quot;some regions in Asia&quot; from late September onwards. America and Europe will then see Stars arrive &quot;in the weeks that follow&quot;.


Collectibles shown included 3D models of Ape Escape, Sony&#x27;s bizarre ChordMachine boombox, a PlayStation 3, Sony&#x27;s feline mascot Toro, the PocketStation peripheral.

Closing out tonight&#x27;s State of Play, we were invited to &quot;set out on an epic and unflinching journey as Kratos and Atreus struggle with holding on and letting go&quot; in a new story trailer. We can see the towing Tyr (the other god of war) in more detail in this new tease, as well as swelling music and heart pounding scenes - I mean, of course.

Like a Dragon: Ishin originally released for PS3 and PS4 in Japan (under the name Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!) back in 2014, transplanting the chaotic Yakuza formula to the Late Edo Period for a historical slice of samurai action.


It follows protagonist Sakamoto Ryōma as he returns to his home in Tosa where, after a run-in with a high-ranking samurai, he&#x27;s sentenced to be executed.

This new teaser shows Kazuya and Jin Kazama facing off against each other on a suitably atmospheric backdrop wearing inappropriate clothing. The mother in me wants to get them both a jacket. But I digress.

                              <span>Following a similar move by Activision Blizzard last year, EA has unveiled EA AntiCheat (EAAC), a new internally developed kernel-level anti-cheat system that&#x27;ll initially be rolling out with the launch of FIFA 23 on PC this autumn.


Announcing EAAC - which is officially described as a &quot;kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution&quot; - in a new blog post, the publisher explained, &quot;PC cheat developers have increasingly moved into the kernel, so we need to have kernel-mode protections to ensure fair play and tackle PC cheat developers on an even playing field.&quot;


EAAC&#x27;s arrival will coincide with the release of FIFA 23, which brings cross-play across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation to the series for the first time. &quot;In addition to EAAC protecting our PC players from cheaters,&quot; EA notes, &quot;our console players who match with PC opponents will also be protected from cheaters operating on PC platforms.&quot;

Announced back in June 2021, The Pitt - which is inspired by the Fallout 3 add-on of the same name - takes players to a city built on the remains of post-nuclear Pittsburgh, which can explore by embarking on Expeditions, a brand-new feature introduced in today&#x27;s update.


Expeditions are essentially repeatable missions for up to four players that feature new NPCs and new foes to battle, with participants able to earn various in-game rewards for their endeavours. Bethesda says anyone can take part in these new activities but recommends that players be level 50+ &quot;for the best experience&quot;.

                              <span>Following a period of Xbox Insider testing announced earlier this year, Microsoft has officially launched Discord voice chat support for all Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S users.


As of today, anyone on either console will be able to connect directly to Discord Voice chats in order to talk with their friends, wherever they may be. The actual process required to do so, though, is a little convoluted, and first demands that users link their Xbox account to their Discord account - a process that&#x27;ll need to be redone if done previously, so new permissions needed for voice chat on Xbox can be confirmed.


With that step complete, you&#x27;ll next need to make sure you have the Xbox mobile app installed on your phone, and that you console is linked to the app. That done, fire up Discord on either your mobile device or desktop and join the Voice call you want to transfer to Xbox. From here, select the transfer call option, which will automatically open the Xbox mobile app.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct did not disappoint, with a brand new look at The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel, the newly-titled Tears of the Kingdom, plus surprise announcements for Pikmin 4, GoldenEye 007 and a new Fire Emblem game. 
Nintendo finally confirmed Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s name and a release date: 12th May 2023 - plus new details on what to expect from Link&#x27;s next adventure, which will apparently take him &quot;to the vast lands of Hyrule... up into the skies and [into] an expanded world that goes beyond that.&quot;
Originally confirmed to Eurogamer by Shigeru Miyamoto in 2015, Nintendo finally gave us an official first teaser for Pikmin 4. I can&#x27;t quite believe it&#x27;s still in development, but it is, and it is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2023.

                              <span>A new gameplay trailer for Bayonetta 3 shows off plenty of the titular witch in action, as well as new character Viola.


As revealed in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta will be up against man-made bioweapons called Homunculi. She&#x27;ll be joined by series favourites Luka, Jeanne, and new ally Viola.


Perhaps the biggest addition (literally) to combat this time are the infernal demons.

                              <span>Wube Software&#x27;s much-loved construction and management sim Factorio will be making its way to Switch on 28th October.


Factorio, which has garnered a seemingly endless procession of rave reviews since entering Steam early access all the way back in 2016 (it got its full release in 2020), casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation.


Ultimately, the goal is to build a rocket ship and escape the planet you&#x27;ve crash-landed on - a process that begins by farming natural resources to create basic machines which, in turn, open up more and more construction possibilities the further you travel along the tech tree. Eventually, with the planet&#x27;s hostile local wildlife dead and conveyor belts stretching as far as the eye can see, freedom should, hopefully, be yours.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct revealed a lot of surprises - including, of course, the long overdue re-reveal of Pikmin 4 seven whole years after Miyamoto first told us about it - but one of the biggest shocks didn&#x27;t even get a place in the western broadcast. It turns out that Clap Hanz just quietly released its latest golf game on the eShop, rebranded as Easy Come, Easy Golf. 


It&#x27;s effectively a re-release of Clap Hanz Golf, which we first saw on Apple Arcade last April, and which was the developer&#x27;s first non-PlayStation foray. On PlayStation, Clap Hanz was behind the brilliant Everybody&#x27;s Golf series, games we&#x27;ve been championing on Eurogamer for some time. Clap Hanz Golf was essentially more Everybody&#x27;s Golf on a different platform - so to see it reborn on the Switch where it can be played with traditional controls is a very welcome thing indeed. 


You can find Easy Come Easy Golf on the Switch right now, where it currently costs £17.59.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming fantasy farming game Harvestella is getting a Switch eShop demo today, ahead of its 4th November release.


Harvestella - a sort of blend of Final Fantasy, Harvest Moon, and Rune Factory - casts players as an amnesiac who wakes up in a world where the seasons are governed by four giant crystals known as Seaslight. Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.


What follows is a familiar blend of farming, socialising, and adventuring that sees players growing crops to raise the money needed to buy new farming and adventuring equipment - the latter helping players gradually push deeper into Harvestella&#x27;s dungeon-like regions where they&#x27;ll encounter enemies and bosses, and gather resources required elsewhere.

Village, of course, is the direct sequel to 2017&#x27;s Resident Evil 7 and follows that game&#x27;s protagonist, Ethan Winters, as he travels to a mysterious village filled with mutant creatures - and some exceptionally tall ladies - in order to find his kidnapped daughter.


There&#x27;s a demo version out today on Switch&#x27;s eShop, and Capcom says it&#x27;ll also be releasing Village&#x27;s previously announced Winters&#x27; Expansion - promising the likes of new story content and a new third-person mode - for Switch on 2nd December.

Tunic was previously only available on Xbox consoles, PC and Mac, and was also a day one Xbox Game Pass title.
If you&#x27;re not familiar with Tunic, it&#x27;s an indie game primarily developed by just one person, Andrew Shouldice, who was inspired by early Zelda games and their detailed manuals, particularly Zelda II - but don&#x27;t let that put you off.

                              <span>Octopath Traveler 2 was announced during this afternoon&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, and will launch on Switch 24th February 2023. The Square Enix Japan OT2 trailer also notes Steam, PS4 and PS5 releases for the game (thanks, commenter TinyKaiju! Great name, too).
The sequel takes place in a new era and involves eight new characters whose adventures you&#x27;ll get to individually play. The era appears to be more modern and reminds me of a kind of 18th/19th Century. There are huge, ocean-going ships but also trains of a kind, probably steam. And it looks as deliciously dinky and delicate as Octopath Traveler did before it.
Characters will also apparently now have different path actions at day and night, and there&#x27;s specific mention of their stories intertwining in this game.

Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto first confirmed Pikmin 4 to me as part of an interview with Eurogamer back in 2015. It&#x27;s fair to say we&#x27;ve been waiting on this one for a while.


In 2017, I asked Miyamoto about the project again - and heard from the Nintendo legend that it was still progressing. I never gave up hope.

This Switch port, annouced as part of today&#x27;s Direct, will offer local wireless play via a Friends Pass which lends this version of It Takes Two its own edge.

The twosome must work together to complete multiple tests presented to them by It Takes Two&#x27;s relationship therapist, Dr. Hakim... The Book of Love.

                              <span>Steam users beware: there&#x27;s a new browser-in-the-browser phishing scam technique that&#x27;s baiting players with the promise of tournament play.

                              <span>Facebook parent company Meta is yet to reveal its long-awaited high-end VR headset - but photos and videos of a prototype are now available online. 


An early sample of the device, apparently left behind by accident, was recently discovered by hotel worker Ramiro Cardenas - after he responded to complaints of a pile of rubbish left in a bag in a corridor.


Cardenas, a VR fan, quickly realised what the device actually was - and promptly posted a series of photos and videos on the internet.

                              <span>Square Enix and PlatinumGames are binning off their beleagured live service game Babylon&#x27;s Fall. 


Future updates planned for the game have been scrapped, and its servers will go dark on 28th February next year. After that, you will no longer be able to log in and play.


Babylon&#x27;s Fall only launched in March this year, but has struggled to attract players from the get-go. Square Enix confirmed it was pulling the plug this morning, and said it would run a final season of content from November until the game goes dark.

Michał Nowakowski, CD Projekt&#x27;s vice president of business development, confirmed the news during a recent earnings call (thanks IGN).



&quot;We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,&quot; said Nowakowski. &quot;Having said that, we&#x27;re totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion.

It&#x27;s described as an original intellectual property, and a &quot;truly AAA experience&quot; based in fantasy feudal Japan. More information will be announced later this month, EA added. Concept art is below:

The Axie Infinity recovery represents a shift in law enforcement’s ability to trace funds through a web of so-called crypto addresses, the virtual accounts where cryptocurrencies are stored. These addresses can be created quickly without them being linked to a cryptocurrency company that could freeze the funds.
In its effort to mask the stolen crypto, Lazarus Group used more than 12,000 different addresses, according to Chainalysis. Unlike bank transactions that happen through private networks, movement between crypto accounts is visible to the world on the blockchain...</span>

                              <span>Sony has announced it&#x27;ll be airing a new instalment of its State of Play digital showcase tomorrow, 13th September, highlighting a range of PS5, PS4, and PSVR2 games.


It&#x27;s a late one for those of us in the UK, alas, kicking off at 11pm BST/3pm PT/6pm ET, but it should be decently eventful too, promising around 20 minutes of reveals, updates, and gameplay for a total of 10 games.


What those games are remains a mystery, but Sony does tease &quot;great updates from our amazing Japanese partners, along with a few other surprises from developers all around the world&quot;.

                              <span>New comments by Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot suggest the publisher will be adopting the increasingly industry standard $70 USD price point for its &quot;big AAA&quot; titles in the future.


It&#x27;s a price point that&#x27;s already been adopted by many publishers - including the likes of Sony, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox - on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but Ubisoft, for its part, insisted it had &quot;not made any decision yet&quot; when asked about bumping its prices up during an investor call last year.


However, it seemed like the publisher might finally have made its mind up when, back in July, it announced its upcoming pirate adventure Skull and Bones would cost $70/£70 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S - and now CEO Guillemot has indicated this will be the norm going forward.

Ross, who also serves as Microsoft corporate vice president, has been the head of 343 Industries for 15 years, having established the studio - specifically to take over development of the Halo franchise from Bungie - back in 2007.


Announcing her departure from 343 in a statement shared on Twitter, Ross explained, &quot;While I had hoped to stay with Halo until we released the Winter Update, I am letting you know I will be leaving 343 and attending a family medical issue&quot;.

Free for Life is, according to Paradox, focussed on implementing the Prison Architect community&#x27;s most requested features so &quot;players can spend more time managing their compound rather than navigating menus&quot;.


To that end, it brings a range of enhancements, including an improved scheduler and prison log - the latter enabling players to more easily check inmates&#x27; activities, as well as &quot;uncover misconducts ahead of time and keep track of who gets released, reformed, or reoffended&quot;.

Outside of the Animus, this past weekend was also a major moment for Ubisoft itself, as it emerged from a period of relative silence following a bruising few years of scandal, takeover rumours, and further discontent surrounding its NFT plans. If you missed it, I spoke with Ubisoft boss Yves Guillmot about all of that.
Ubisoft Forward seemed aptly named, with a look over the horizon to a brighter future for the company. But questions remain - as Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

                              <span>Ubisoft has reassured fans concerned over listings for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage which stated it would include &quot;Real Gambling&quot;, as part of &quot;Adults Only&quot; and &quot;18+&quot; ratings for the title. 


At the time of writing, a US Xbox store listing still warns that Mirage contains &quot;Intense Violence, Blood and Gore, Sexual Themes, Partial Nudity, Real Gambling&quot;, and lists it as having received the rare Adults Only 18+ label from the ESRB, the US&#x27; ratings board.


A UK listing similarly mentions &quot;Real Gambling&quot;, alongside &quot;Extreme Violence&quot;, and lists it with a PEGI 18+ rating.

Season one was called Free For All, and was (obviously) related to the free-to-play soft relaunch Fall Guys had back in June.

Season two is titled Satellite Scramble, and is all about (you guessed it) space!

This has included small changes within the cinematics to the various interactive props found throughout the game&#x27;s post-apocalyptic setting.


Now, however, one player has shared what seems to be none other than Dunder Mifflin from NBC&#x27;s mockumentary The Office tucked away in Part 1. 


As shown in the clip below, you can see Joel taking shelter from his enemies in a seemingly ordinary office. However, on closer inspection, there is something familiar about its layout.

                              <span>A new 40-minute Nintendo Direct presentation will be broadcast tomorrow, Tuesday 13th September, at 3pm UK time.


We&#x27;ve been waiting a while for an update from Nintendo on the company&#x27;s end of 2022 plans - as well as a sneak peek into 2023. Over the summer, we&#x27;ve heard various updates on new projects in a rather piecemeal fashion. And now the autumn&#x27;s first big launch - Splatoon 3 - has arrived. 


So, what do we expect? Well, the Direct is well-timed to coincide with Tokyo Games Show later this week, where third-party publishers will be in attendance to demo upcoming Switch games. We&#x27;re also hoping to hear more about Nintendo&#x27;s own plans. Rumours abound of an update on Zelda and Metroid.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s Forspoken has been doing the rounds for a while - the second game built on the Luminous Engine that made its debut with Final Fantasy 15, it was at the forefront of the PlayStation 5&#x27;s reveal when it was known as Project Athia and has had various public showings ahead of its release early next year, but perhaps its most impactful came after a trailer was posted on social media last month and was met with a rough response online, the dialogue becoming the butt of internet jokes.


&quot;It was unexpected to see the reactions to the social media post,&quot; Forspoken&#x27;s creative producer Raio Mitsuo told us after a recent opportunity to go hands-on with the game. &quot;Basically, we used existing footage from previous trailers and put something together as a social media post. And yeah, it went kind of viral in a way - that&#x27;s not the direction that we thought it was going to go! But I have to admit, some of the memes are actually pretty funny, so I got a good laugh out of it. 


&quot;But, you know, for us, it&#x27;s not something that we&#x27;re concerned with. We&#x27;re obviously leaving a lot of information on the table, because we&#x27;re taking dialogue and scenes out of context. Forspoken is a very narrative driven game. It&#x27;s a very story based game. We don&#x27;t want to ruin the experience in our marketing campaign. We&#x27;re being very selective about what to use to generate interest and sometimes without that information about what led up to that moment, or what was the character&#x27;s state of mind, we&#x27;re leaving the audience the full freedom to interpret lines in any way they want. It&#x27;s just one of those challenges that come naturally when trying to find ways to show the game without telling the full story, because we definitely don&#x27;t want to reveal that.&quot;

                              <span>Niantic, the maker of Pokémon Go, has announced Marvel World of Heroes - a new smartphone AR game set to launch globally in 2023.


World of Heroes looks to be the latest in a line of games from Niantic with the company&#x27;s usual focus on outdoor play - and another big license for it to adapt.

The malware was dubbed “Shikitega” for its extensive use of the popular Shikata Ga Nai polymorphic encoder, which allows the malware to “mutate” its code to avoid detection. Shikitega alters its code each time it runs through one of several decoding loops that AT&amp;T said each deliver multiple attacks, beginning with an ELF file that’s just 370 bytes.
Shikitega also downloads Mettle, a Metasploit interpreter that gives the attacker the ability to control attached webcams and includes a sniffer, multiple reverse shells, process control, shell command execution and additional abilities to control the affected system...</span>

                              <span>As part of last night&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, Ubisoft has revealed the first gameplay trailer for its upcoming The Division game, The Division Heartland.

A standalone, free-to-play addition to the The Division series, Heartland is a survival-action multiplayer shooter &quot;set in small-town America within the Division universe&quot;. While initially it was expected to release in &quot;2021-22&quot;, we&#x27;re now looking at 2022-2023 on PC, consoles, and cloud.

&quot;This standalone free-to-play The Division game introduces new playable characters in a rural setting, far from the events in New York and Washington D.C.,&quot; Ubisoft explains, confirming that Red Storm – a &quot;veteran team who has worked on the franchise since the first The Division game&quot; – is developing the shooter.

As just one of the many announcements to have come out of last night&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward, Ubisoft is offering players the chance to &quot;play your favourite franchises, challenge yourself and your friends or create new worlds on PC with Ubisoft+, including new releases on day one and premium editions DLC&quot;.

There are two tiers; you can either limit your access to PC, where you get 30 days to try its library, premium editions, and 100+ games, or you can go for &quot;multi access&quot; which offers the same but also the option to play on Google Stadia via cloud gaming, too.

                              <span>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has refuted claims that its game has been further delayed after Xbox began issuing refunds for pre-orders. 

Earlier this week, those who pre-ordered Stalker 2 began receiving messages informing them that their orders had been cancelled due to the fact that Stalker 2&#x27;s release date has been pushed back to an &quot;unconfirmed date in the future&quot;. At the same time, the pre-order option on the Xbox store was disabled.

Following Putin&#x27;s illegal and barbaric invasion of Ukraine, the studio&#x27;s home, GSC Game World initially put Stalker 2&#x27;s development on hold, picking it up again once the studio was later relocated to Prague. Though originally slated to release in April this year, it was pushed to the first half of 2023 and the fact there&#x27;s no solid date is reportedly why Xbox is offering refunds.

As confirmed at The Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, Empty Clip will be taking on the 27-year-old platformer and updating it to join &quot;revived classics like The Jungle Book, Aladdin, and The Lion King&quot; with &quot;updated visuals and controls&quot; and will be coming to unspecified &quot;modern consoles&quot; and PC.

Described as a &quot;fan-favourite that&#x27;s sure to have you screaming like a Viking yeeted by Goliath&quot;, Disney was keen to stress that we &quot;have to wait to climb back into the world of Gargoyles Remastered&quot;, so we probably shouldn&#x27;t expect it any time soon (thanks, PC Gamer).

Whilst keen to stress that the mobile devices in &quot;this test do not represent the final list of devices for launch&quot; and that &quot;content and quality of the game are still a work-in-progress&quot;, the developer/publisher says a closed beta will go live tomorrow, 12th September, in select countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, Singapore, and India.

Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t look like any Europeans or players with Apple devices can get involved just yet.

                              <span>The talk right now may be all about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, but it&#x27;s not quite all over for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla fans – a final story expansion is coming later this year.

Subtitled The Last Chapter – because, of course, it&#x27;s the last chapter – Valhalla&#x27;s final expansion is expected to launch &quot;in a few months time&quot; and sees Eivor &quot;say goodbye&quot; to their people and set forth for &quot;distant shores and new adventures&quot;. 

The free quest arc will &quot;nicely tie up some of the storylines established throughout the game&quot; and see Eivor reunite with some key characters... &quot;including some influential historical ones&quot;, according to Ubisoft.

                              <span>Ubisoft has laid down a roadmap for the future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, featuring two major new games coming beyond 2023&#x27;s Baghdad-set Mirage.


Set in feudal Japan, Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Project Red will arrive at some point after 2023. It&#x27;s described as an open-world RPG, a chance for fans to live out their powerful shinobi fantasy, and is in development by the talented Quebec-based team behind Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.


Sometime after that, Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Project Hexe will be next to launch. Details are extremely thin, but it looks to be a mysterious, witchcraft-inspired entry, and is being worked on by the Valhalla team at Ubisoft Montreal.

                              <span>In tonight&#x27;s flurry of announcements surrounding the future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Ubisoft has announced the series&#x27; first open-world game for mobile devices.


It&#x27;s currently named Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Jade, and is described as &quot;coming soon&quot;.


Jade will be set in ancient China, and let you parkour all over the country&#x27;s Great Wall as a player-created character. (So, no, you&#x27;re not playing as fan-favourite Shao Jun. But perhaps she&#x27;ll appear?)

                              <span>At a press event designed to set out the future of Ubisoft, its boss Yves Guillemot briefly touched upon its workplace crisis, which began in 2020. 


Numerous reports of sexual misconduct sparked a round of departures from the company, but Ubisoft has remained under pressure ever since - and even this week - from staff who feel the publisher has not done enough. 


On Thursday, in Paris, at a briefing attended by Eurogamer, Guillemot described the moment as a &quot;stumble&quot; which the company had since acknowledged and learned from.

Speaking this week in Paris, Assassin&#x27;s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté revealed a presentation slide for Invictus full of artwork showing past Assassin&#x27;s Creed protagonists, as well as enemies such as Odyssey&#x27;s minotaur. 


&quot;Codename Invictus is being designed to be a standalone game on the Infinity hub, alongside Codename Red and Codename Hexe,&quot; Coté announced.

                              <span>Speaking to Eurogamer this week at Ubisoft&#x27;s headquarters in Paris, Assassin&#x27;s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has exenstively detailed what the franchise&#x27;s mysterious new Infinity platform will look like, and offer fans.
Infinity appears to be the brainchild of Coté, whose new role as head of Ubisoft&#x27;s biggest franchise sees him looking to revamp the series into a series of blockbuster single-player games, a standalone multiplayer portion and smaller free experiences for fans - all of which will be accessible from Infinity. 
The platform will also serve as the new, dedicated home to Assassin&#x27;s Creed&#x27;s modern day story, which will progress separately to upcoming games Codename Red, set in feudal Japan, and Codename Hexe, which looks to be set in 16th century Europe.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward event has revealed a first glimpse at Mirage, next year&#x27;s new Assassin&#x27;s Creed adventure - although we&#x27;re still waiting for a look at gameplay, and there&#x27;s still no firmer release date than &quot;2023&quot;. 

Still, we now know much more about Mirage than we did through this year&#x27;s drip-feed of leaks from around the internet - and from Ubisoft itself. And this week, I sat down with several of the game&#x27;s Bordeaux-based development team for a deeper dive into what was shown publicly today. Read on for details of djinn, a popular rumour seemingly being denied, and more details on that Prince of Persia crossover.

Mirage is set in Baghdad and begins in the year 861, when the city enjoyed a golden age where it was a commercial and cultural crossroads. It was home to all manner of faces from all parts of the known world - a perfect cast for an Assassin&#x27;s Creed game - and also, of course, future Master Assassin himself, Basim Ibn Ishaq. When the game begins, we meet Basim several decades before his journey to England and arrival in the story of 2020&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. Here, on the streets of Baghdad, Basim begins as a petty thief, who catches the eye of the Hidden Ones.

We&#x27;d expect to see all of those franchises represented this evening, when the livestream begins at 8pm UK time. There&#x27;s also a pre-show event for keen beans, beginning at 7.35pm UK time.


Ubisoft has promised this show will reveal the &quot;future&quot; of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, beginning with next year&#x27;s Baghdad-set stealth game Mirage. But we&#x27;re hoping and expecting much more as well - including a look, and hopefully some concrete details, on the company&#x27;s ambitious-sounding Infinity platform for the future of the franchise.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley has revealed an all-new Toy Story realm.

Showcased at the recent Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, the realm looks exactly as you just may expect, including a recreation of Andy&#x27;s bedroom where you&#x27;ll get to hang out with your favourite Toy Story characters.

Admittedly, we didn&#x27;t learn much else - the trailer doesn&#x27;t even last two minutes and the description simply says &quot;discover the brand-new Toy Story adventure coming this fall in Dreamlight Valley&quot; – but we did learned that you&#x27;ll be able to partner up with &quot;Woody and Buzz&quot; for a &quot;brand-new Toy Story adventure&quot; where you&#x27;ll also be able to bring your friends from other Disney valleys, too.

                              <span>Steam Deck repair centres are now open.

Valve says that should you &quot;encounter an issue&quot; with its new handheld system, you can send your Steam Deck for repair or replacement via one of its repair centres, where the team will &quot;diagnose the device, repair if needed, then ship the fixed unit back to you&quot;.

Whilst in-warranty repairs will be carried out free of charge, Valve does remind players that &quot;if your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty&quot;, although repair centres will repair accidental damage &quot;for a fee&quot;. Otherwise, Steam Deck owners are invited to &quot;fix things yourself&quot; with repair kits, replacement parts, and guides all available at iFixit.

The new 2D adventure has been built upon a cancelled 2016 project by Dlala Studios and will feature Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, and Goofy, inspired by the Mickey Mouse cartoon shorts. You can check it out in the trailer below:

&quot;Join Mickey &amp; Friends on a quest to save a mysterious world from disaster!&quot; teases the game&#x27;s description on YouTube. &quot;In this brand-new 1-4 player cooperative adventure platformer, you’ll navigate as Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy through a beautifully hand-crafted world as you run, swim, swing, and jump to recover three magical books to save the world.&quot;

                              <span>A now-deleted Epic Games Store graphic suggests Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is coming to PC next month.

Though the store page was almost instantly pulled down and amended, it wasn&#x27;t quick enough to fool the internet, which managed to catch a proposed release date of 19th October, 2022.

Looks like there&#x27;ll be a Fortnite-flavoured pre-order bonus, too; a &quot;snazzy new Fortnite glider in the shape of Sully&#x27;s seaplane&quot;.

2K confirmed the news earlier this week, saying it will be an &quot;authentic mobile experience for the NBA 2K basketball game&quot; that includes the &quot;all-new exclusive mode&quot;, The Greatest, which features 20 of the Greatest of All-Time NBA players from the current NBA season at launch, including cover athlete Devin Booker, and NBA legends like Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

&quot;Players will also enjoy a more immersive and realistic NBA gameplay experience with commentary from NBA play-by-play announcers and colour analysts, such as Kevin Harlan, Brian Anderson, Greg Anthony, Grant Hill, and Doris Burke for the first time,&quot; the developer says.

To date, developer TT Games has graced The Skywalker Saga with seven DLC Character Packs - Solo, Rogue One, The Bad Batch, Trooper, The Mandalorian&#x27;s first and second seasons, plus a Classic Character Pack - pushing the game&#x27;s playable character roster well over the 400 mark.


Come the release of November&#x27;s Galactic Edition, however, that line-up will be expanded further with characters including Cassian Andor, Captain Rex, and Reva. These will arrive as part of six new Character Packs, named as The Clone Wars, The Book of Boba Fett, Rebels, Summer Vacation, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Andor.

                              <span>As promised, Disney has shared a first official tease for Amy Hennig&#x27;s now marginally less mysterious Marvel project - although solid details, including a name, still remain elusive.


Announced last October, few official details have so-far been shared about the project - currently in development at Skydance New Media, the studio Hennig set up in 2019 - beyond the fact it&#x27;ll be a &quot;narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure&quot; set in the Marvel universe.


And while solid details are still hard to come by, today&#x27;s teaser trailer does appear to confirm rumours circling yesterday - understood to be true by Eurogamer - that Hennig&#x27;s game would be set in WW2, and see Captain America and Black Panther battling the forces of Hydra.

                              <span>Firaxis&#x27; Marvel-themed tactical RPG Midnight Suns will, following a number of earlier delays, finally launch for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 - but the previously announced Xbox One, PS4, and Switch versions are still missing in action.


Announced last August, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns - which draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s - is superhero strategy game that follows a roster of familiar faces on an adventure blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building.


Midnight Suns was originally due to launch in March this year but was delayed last November in order to add &quot;more story, cinematics and overall polish&quot;. Unfortunately, as its revised 7th October approached, publisher 2K and Firaxis made the decision to delay it once more to deliver the best possible experience for everyone.&quot;

The original Little Nightmares debuted for PC and consoles back in 2017, telling the deliciously unsettling tale of yellow-raincoated moppet Six, as she attempted to escape The Maw - a strange underwater vessel inhabited by a multitude of bizarre residents.


The adventure was warmly received on release, with Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a &quot;masterpiece of meat and malice&quot; in his Recommended review.

                              <span>Former Call of Duty director and Treyarch co-head Jason Blundell has departed Deviation Games, the studio he co-founded with fellow Call of Duty alumni Dave Anthony - and which is currently working on its first, PlayStation-exclusive project.


Deviation Games&#x27; partnership with Sony was made public in June 2021, with the announcement only going as far as to say the 100-person studio was currently working on a &quot;brand-new original IP&quot;, said to have already been in development for a year at the time.


Blundell&#x27;s departure from Deviation - which comes even before the studio&#x27;s first title has been officially revealed - was announced in a statement shared on Twitter. It did not elaborate further on Blundell&#x27;s leaving, only saying,&quot; We appreciate the contributions Jason has made and we wish him the best in his future endeavours&quot;.

                              <span>There are lots of very good things about From Software&#x27;s majestic Elden Ring, but one of the very best good things - as is the case with much of the developer&#x27;s games - is its sublime soundtrack. And now publisher Bandai Namco has made the entire thing officially available to listen to across a wide range of music streaming services.


The newly released digital soundtrack runs a total of 34 tracks, variously composed by Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Yuka Kitamura, Yoshimi Kudo, and Tai Tomisawa - many of whom are long-time From Software collaborators, having worked on the likes of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Bloodborne.


Their cumulative expertise on Elden Ring, though, has created a belter of a soundtrack, and now users of Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, the iTunes Store, YouTube Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and Deezer can relive their adventures in the Lands Between through the power of sonic reminiscence. Full links can be found here.

                              <span>Today, Splatoon 3 was released for the Nintendo Switch.
As such, many dedicated fans have taken to Splatoon 2 to say their farewells to the beloved game, leaving Inkopolis Square awash with truly heartwarming messages.
Martin recently awarded Splatoon 3 a Recommended badge, remarking that while there are &quot;few surprises to be found in Splatoon 3&#x27;s multiplayer or campaign&quot; it is still the &quot;best Nintendo&#x27;s spectacular series has been to date&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m Here&quot; is the name of the intro song, sung by vocalist Merry Kirk-Holmes a.k.a To Octavia. The ending song, meanwhile, is &quot;Vandalize&quot; by Japanese rock band One OK Rock.


Both songs have teaser videos featuring footage from the game.

You can also grab a free skin bundle for Realm Royale, but Hundred Days is certainly the bigger pull of the two.

Bertie and Donlan called Hundred Days charming and bright in their preview piece last year, and it&#x27;s a game I would personally recommend too.

The interviews were conducted by the ACSisterhood group, a movement that began in response to those misconduct and abuse allegations.

Sony previously shared a taster of the various offerings that will be available in its Norse epic, but Ragnarök&#x27;s lead UX designer Mila Pavlin has now highlighted even more of them, including things such as puzzle modifications and auto-sprinting down muddy roads.


Speaking to Game Informer, Pavlin said that the team focused on four main components when it came to accessibility: Vision, hearing, motor skills, and cognitive understanding.

Last week, Ninja tweeted &quot;I just need a break... I don&#x27;t know when I will be back, or where&quot;, removed his profile pictures across all platforms, and changed his display names to &quot;User Not Found&quot;.


Many assumed his actions were signs of burnout and a mental health crisis, but in fact it was just a disgusting ruse before his big return.

                              <span>Blizzard vice president Jon Spector has shed more light on the upcoming release of Overwatch 2 and its Battle Pass heroes.


Following on from rumours claiming Overwatch 2 heroes would need to be unlocked in the Battle Pass via a paid style similar to Fortnite (which sees characters put into the paid battle pass, while the free track simply offers a few rewards), Spector had the following to say:

A report from XGP (via VGC), reveals that those who had pre-ordered the game have been receiving messages informing them that their orders have now been cancelled. 


The message goes on to state this is due to the fact that Stalker 2&#x27;s release date has been pushed back to an &quot;unconfirmed date in the future&quot;. Meanwhile, the pre-order option on the Xbox store appears to have been disabled.

                              <span>Stewart Baker discusses why the industry-norm responsible disclosure for software vulnerabilities fails for cryptocurrency software.
Why can’t the cryptocurrency industry solve the problem the way the software and hardware industries do, by patching and updating security as flaws are found? Two reasons: First, many customers don’t have an ongoing relationship with the hardware and software providers that protect their funds­—nor do they have an incentive to update security on a regular basis. Turning to a new security provider or using updated software creates risks; leaving everything the way it was feels safer. So users won’t be rushing to pay for and install new security patches...</span>

                              <span>Ahead of its official unveiling at tomorrow&#x27;s Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, new rumours have emerged surrounding Skydance Media and Amy Hennig&#x27;s upcoming Marvel title.


Announced last October, few official details have so-far been shared on the project beyond the fact it&#x27;ll be a &quot;narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure&quot; set in the Marvel universe.


However, Marvel rumour collator MCU Status is now reporting that Hennig&#x27;s game takes place during World War 2, and will see Captain America and Black Panther taking on the forces of Hydra. Eurogamer understands this to be correct.

&quot;We know the Xbox homepage is where our gamers spend a lot of their time, and it&#x27;s a space that&#x27;s very personal,&quot; senior product manager lead Ivy Krislov explained in a new Xbox Wire post. &quot;We also know we can always be listening and learning how we can do better here while keeping your experience fast and familiar.&quot;


To that end, Microsoft is this week launching what it calls a &quot;multi-month series of experiments to learn how to create a more personalised home screen experience and address some of the top trends and fan requests.&quot;

                              <span>Lars Gustavsson, creative director on the Battlefield series, is leaving its developer DICE after more than 20 years at the studio.


News of Gustavsson&#x27;s departure from Battlefield, DICE, and indeed EA as a whole, was announced by Battlefield general manager Byron Beede in a blog post detailing the future of the long-running first-person shooter series.


&quot;Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since the beginning and is affectionately known as Mr Battlefield, has decided he is ready for a new adventure,&quot; Beede wrote. &quot;Lars has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to Battlefield and is proud to have helped shape the franchise into what it is today. He is excited to pass the baton to the next generation of Battlefield creators at DICE, Ripple Effect, Industrial Toys, and Ridgeline Games.&quot;

                              <span>Just days after releasing an updated early access roadmap for Phasmophobia, developer Kinetic Games has announced the ghost hunting sim&#x27;s next big patch - known as the Apocalypse Update - will be arriving on 27th September.


There&#x27;s a lot going on in Phasmophobia&#x27;s Apocalypse Update, starting with the arrival of the new Sunny Meadows Mental Institution map - an entirely reworked, more visually interesting, and, crucially, more compact version of the game&#x27;s previously released Asylum map.


A recent poll suggested smaller maps were high on the list of players&#x27; wants, and - intentionally or otherwise - the Apocalypse Update seems to be delivering on that front. Not only is a smaller Sunny Meadows variant known as &#x27;Restricted&#x27; included - offering &quot;5 small maps in 1&quot; - it also adds Camp Woodwind, a miniature variant of the Maple Lodge Campsite map.

                              <span>PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has spoken out against Microsoft&#x27;s offer to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for &quot;at least several more years&quot; beyond Sony&#x27;s existing agreement with publisher Activision Blizzard, calling the deal &quot;inadequate on many levels&quot; - despite Microsoft&#x27;s insistence it went &quot;well beyond typical gaming industry agreements&quot;.


It&#x27;s the latest shot fired in an increasingly public back and forth between the two companies as governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard grows, particularly in relation to its impact on other gaming platforms. The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, for instance, recently said the deal would give rise to the &quot;realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


It&#x27;s in this climate that Xbox boss Phil Spencer last week attempted to placate concerns it might be looking to make the hugely popular Call of Duty series - which the CMA called &quot;important and capable of making a material difference to the success of rivals&#x27; gaming platforms&quot; - an Xbox exclusive if the acquisition gained approval, insisting that it had &quot;provided a signed agreement to Sony [in January] to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract&quot;.

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably not much of a surprise given CD Projekt&#x27;s previous assertion that its currently in-development new Witcher game would mark the start of a &quot;new saga for the franchise&quot;, but the studio has now explicitly confirmed it&#x27;s already &quot;thinking about&quot; new instalments beyond that.


Asked to elaborate on the company&#x27;s use of the word &quot;saga&quot; during CD Projekt&#x27;s latest earnings call, president and joint CEO Adam Kiciński clarified that &quot;like the first saga was three games...we are in pre-production of the first game from the second Witcher saga.&quot; As such, the studio is  already &quot;thinking about more than one game&quot;.


Hardly a shocking revelation, admittedly, but additional clarity is always welcome.

                              <span>Developer Amplitude Studios has unveiled Together We Rule, the first major expansion for its historical 4X strategy game Humankind - one that&#x27;ll bring new diplomacy and espionage focused additions when it launches some time this autumn.


&quot;In Humankind,&quot; Amplitude explains in its announcement,&quot; we’ve always wanted there to be more ways to win than simple military domination. And while the game’s unified victory condition, Fame, was a first step towards that, we’re now ready to take things much further&quot;.


To that end, Together We Rule (which follows several smaller culture-focused DLC packs) will introduce new features - including the Congress of Humankind, Embassies, and Agents - that are intended to &quot;help players see the world in a new light and resolve conflicts differently&quot;.

                              <span>Corecell has hit back at publisher PQube, disputing its defence over withheld funds.


Last week, PQube was under fire once again from a developer (Corecell) releasing a damning statement against the publisher. It followed earlier accusations from Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions that left the team &quot;feeling manipulated and exploited&quot;.




With regards to its game AeternoBlade 2, Corecell claimed that PQube &quot;only paid a small part of the minimum guarantee of the signing milestone by the time we sent them the game and they never paid the remaining milestones&quot;, among other issues over publishing control.

In anticipation of his arrival, the team has shared more about Gizmo&#x27;s moveset and confirmed that he will be a support character, much like the likes of Scooby-Doo&#x27;s Velma.


The small card shared on the MultiVersus Twitter feed states that Gizmo will have a move called &quot;Gizmo-A-Go-Go&quot;. This will see Gizmo attaching himself onto the back of his allies. He will also be able to &quot;sing and spawn musical note projectiles&quot; that will damage nearby enemies thanks to a move called Song of the Mogwai.

This bundle, known as the Hazel Bundle, will allow players to &quot;suit up&quot; as Umbrella Acadamy&#x27;s other time travelling assassin Hazel (the clue was in the name there), thanks to the new legendary operative skin. It comes with the pink dog head and all, and is available now.


&quot;Everything happens like it&#x27;s supposed to... including your enemies getting eliminated,&quot; reads the teaser for this latest Call of Duty collaboration, which you can see for yourself below.

The DDoS attack last weekend that put a temporary stop to leaking Entrust data was seen as an opportunity to explore the triple extortion tactic to apply more pressure on victims to pay a ransom.
LockBitSupp said that the ransomware operator is now looking to add DDoS as an extortion tactic on top of encrypting data and leaking it.
“I am looking for dudosers [DDoSers] in the team, most likely now we will attack targets and provide triple extortion, encryption + date leak + dudos, because I have felt the power of dudos and how it invigorates and makes life more interesting,” LockBitSupp wrote in a post on a hacker forum...</span>

Some Kubernetes components (such as kubelet and kube-proxy) create
iptables chains and rules as part of their operation. These chains
were never intended to be part of any Kubernetes API/ABI guarantees,
but some external components nonetheless make use of some of them (in
particular, using KUBE-MARK-MASQ to mark packets as needing to be
masqueraded).
As a part of the v1.25 release, SIG Network made this declaration
explicit: that (with one exception), the iptables chains that
Kubernetes creates are intended only for Kubernetes’s own internal
use, and third-party components should not assume that Kubernetes will
create any specific iptables chains, or that those chains will contain
any specific rules if they do exist.
Then, in future releases, as part of KEP-31…</span>

                              <span>Stray Fawn&#x27;s The Wandering Village - a city building sim set on the back of a giant, roaming creature - will be launching into Steam early access next Wednesday, 14th September.


Announced last August, The Wandering Village tasks players with constructing a safe haven for a group of survivors in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world. Its city building aspects might be familiar, but those are combined with resource management, rogue-like elements, and survival, all connected to the ever-moving creature, known as Onbu, the survivors now call home.


&quot;Forging a relationship between the villagers and Onbu might be challenging at times, as their interests often don’t align,&quot; Stray Fawn explains. &quot;As a living creature, its unique body poses its own challenges for your village design. There&#x27;s every chance a spike may have grown where villagers intended to place their kitchen, while a failed harvest may cause desperation and tempt villagers to draw blood from the creature for food.&quot;

                              <span>PowerWash Simulator - developer FuturLab&#x27;s wildly compelling dirt-busting squirt &#x27;em up - is currently celebrating 3m million players having hoisted nozzles since the game&#x27;s launch on Xbox and PC back in May. And that milestone coincides with the opening of nominations for the next filth-encrusted edifice to be added to the game.


There&#x27;s not much more to say on the 3m players front, which Futurlab announced on Twitter earlier today, other than to say its success is thoroughly well-deserved. Eurgamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese - who wrote about the serene pleasures of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s sedate busywork in July - is far from the only member of the editorial team to have fallen in love with its daffy charms and compulsive rhythms.


And if, like me, you&#x27;ve reached the end of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s gloriously ludicrous campaign and urgently require more things to blast back into the realms of cleanliness, the good news is FuturLab is currently working on new additions - with the developer currently taking suggestions for what should come next.

                              <span>Ahead of this weekend&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward digital showcase, a new report has claimed the event will offer a look at three previously unannounced Assassin&#x27;s Creed titles - one set in Japan, another in 16th century Europe, and a third in China.


Earlier this week, Ubisoft confirmed it would be &#x27;unveiling the future&#x27; of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise during this Saturday&#x27;s digital showcase, but stopped short of providing specifics. A look at the recently recently confirmed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage seemed a certainty, but a new report has suggested the publisher might in fact have a lot more its ready to share.


According to relentlessly leaky (and usually reliable) journalist Tom Henderson, writing for Try Hard Guides, Ubisoft Forward&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed portion will indeed begin with a &quot;deep dive&quot; into Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage.

                              <span>With God of War Ragnarök inching ever closer to its 9th November release on PlayStation, the pre-launch pre-amble keeps on coming, this time with a closer look at the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim in a new video.


Svartalfheim is, of course, one of the Nine Realms at the heart of God of War&#x27;s current Norse-themed saga, and one of three - alongside Vanaheim and Asgard - that were unreachable in the first game. Players will finally be able to complete the set in Ragnarök, though, as well as getting a chance to return to previously visited realms to explore new locations.


Svartalfheim, like other realms, can be accessed via the gateway located at the centre of the Lake of Nine (frozen over in Ragnarök thanks to the onset of Fimbulwinter) and - as detailed in a new GameInformer video - will present players with plenty of dwarven ingenuity to explore, including mine pits, artificial water channels, and sprawling cities.

These images show a planned storyline similar to one seen in Angelina Jolie&#x27;s debut turn as Lara Croft, with Croft Manor being attacked by masked assailants.


Shared by artist Jake Lunt Davies, the images show Lara&#x27;s home on an atmospherically dark and stormy night. Meanwhile, in the grounds, several shady looking characters are depicted planning their infiltration of the manor.

                              <span>Mario Kart Tour has made Nintendo an estimated $293m globally to become the company&#x27;s second highest grossing mobile game.


That&#x27;s according to data from reliable app store analytics company Sensor Tower, from across both the App Store and Google Play store.


The estimates follow the recent news that Nintendo will remove gacha elements from Mario Kart Tour, which allow players to spend money on randomised rewards. This will be replaced by a rotating item shop.

In a series of tweets on his Japanese account, he shared some background information on the game celebrating the 35th anniversary of the series (thanks SiliconEra).


Kojima wanted to push the realism of his fictional story using real war footage and, of course, the PlayStation console was able to play compressed film so this wasn&#x27;t a technical limitation.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is getting in the spirit of Talk Like a Pirate Day with a week of celebrations that&#x27;ll include the swashbuckling multiplayer adventure&#x27;s latest XP-boosting community event.


The general festivities begin on Thursday, 15th September (running until Tuesday, 20th September),  bringing a free Arrrgh! emote for anyone that logs in during the event, plus special Merchant Alliance fireworks, and discounts in the premium Pirate Emporium store. Additionally, players will be able to pick up a second free emote - Ranting Rogue - from the Pirate Emporium.


The main event, though, is Season Seven&#x27;s Community Day, running for 24 hours from 10am UTC on Sunday, 17th September. A &quot;generous&quot; Renown XP boost will be applied to all in-game activities for the duration, helping players work through this season&#x27;s progression track more easily, and it&#x27;ll be accompanied by a set of additional player-driven boosts via Twitter.

                              <span>Kinetic Games has released an updated development roadmap for its deliciously spooky ghost hunting sim Phasmophobia, with the game&#x27;s custom difficulty feature now set to release this month with plenty more on the way.


As Kinetic explains in a new Steam post, the team has now revised its early access roadmap for 2022 and beyond to &quot;more accurately represents what we achieved this year, and what we plan to do moving forwards&quot; following a longer-than-expected development period for Phasmophobia&#x27;s VR rework, which eventually arrived in April.


Kinetic has released some smaller updates since then to keep players appropriately terrified but it&#x27;s all go in September with the advent of Phasmophobia&#x27;s Custom Difficulty update, which the developers says is &quot;a big one&quot;.

                              <span>The Torchlight series is returning - although this time as a free-to-play game for PC, iPhone and Android devices.


An early Steam version of the game is available to download now, as part of a closed beta test before a full launch next month, some time in October. (You can request access via its Steam page.)


There&#x27;s a whiff of Diablo Immortal to Torchlight Infinite, which has numerous ways to spend money within the game. Monetisation will include a season pass, monthly pass, auction house and premium currency bundles. Spending and progress will be reset at the end of the current beta, though the amount you spend will then be granted back when the game fully arrives.

Created by SpaceDasher, the mod lets you choose between Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello or Michelangelo to swing around as. Or maybe that should be swim around as?

One such discussion taking place focuses on a potential new IP from Naughty Dog, that many believe will have a fantasy theme. This all started after several posters with fantasy-like elements were spotted adorning the game&#x27;s walls.


The posters in question, which can be seen below, show images of a Pegasus-like horse, a dragon, and a female warrior:

                              <span>The Lord of the Rings&#x27; primary antagonist Sauron has come to Elden Ring thanks to a new armour mod. 


The mod comes from MaxTheMiracle, and reskins the player with Sauron&#x27;s black armour and  humanoid figure seen in the likes of Peter Jackson&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings film adaptations (but without that imposing height).


This mod is still in its early days, but has been released to coincide with Amazon&#x27;s Rings of Power series. As such, the current weapon moveset used within this mod is borrowed from another mod, as work on it continues behind the scenes.

Speaking at PAX West last week, Booty discussed the increased prevalence of multiple developers working together on new games.


&quot;How we make games is evolving,&quot; said Booty. &quot;The idea of a single team under one roof really doesn&#x27;t happen that often anymore.&quot;

Crash&#x27;N&#x27;Dance is being developed by indie dev Fierce the Bandit, who posted a short video of their current progress.

The fan-made project is a rhythm game where players must hit button prompts in time to the music. Fake Crash will pop up on the screen sporadically in an attempt to distract you, but if you&#x27;re successful, Crash will perform his signature boogie and get a shiny crystal.

This update went live over the weekend, and also added an in-game account linking option.
However, despite being labelled as a &quot;quality of life&quot; update, this move by publisher 2K has left some fans unhappy, with several stating the game is now broken.

Among those details includes the fact that Baghdad will be divided into four separate zones, each with a boss to defeat, but also be surrounded by a desert area, oases and rivers.

American adult-oriented nighttime cable television channel Adult Swim shared the new ad on its Rick and Morty social feeds. The clip shows eccentric scientist Rick shaving his head and branding himself with Kratos&#x27; iconic red facial tattoo. He then proceeds to hand his grandson Morty a toy bow and arrow, before shoving him through a portal to the Nine Realms.
Here, Rick gets his hands on Kratos&#x27; Leviathan Axe and &quot;other unannounced upgrades&quot; as Morty tries to fend for himself (rather unsuccessfully) in the hostile world he suddenly finds himself in. It ends with Rick finding a boat, informing the overpowered Morty that he will have to row as Rick doesn&#x27;t want to get his new axe wet. You can watch it for yourself below.

                              <span>A new Elden Ring manga reimagines the game as a comedy.


Or maybe your playthrough was a comedy all along? There&#x27;s certainly a farcical element to all the constant dying.


The manga comes courtesy of Kadokawa - FromSoftware&#x27;s parent company and a huge publisher of manga.

                              <span>Konami&#x27;s much-talked about &quot;unannounced game&quot; could be a new Suikoden title.

A renewed trademark for the game – filed back in July, but only recently spotted – has popped up in Mexico, leading some to speculate that if Konami&#x27;s upcoming TGS spot doesn&#x27;t involve Castlevania, Metal Geat Solid, or Silent Hill, then it just may be about a new installment of the classic RPG series.

The filing – spotted by posters on Reddit and shared at ResetEra – tells us that the filing was made at the end of July and… well, not much else, actually. But it&#x27;s certainly coincidental timing, isn&#x27;t it, particularly as the last main Suikoden title released way back in 2006.

                              <span>Earlier this week, 343 Industries confirmed that split-screen local co-op in Halo Infinite has been cancelled outright - so players are now doing it themselves. 

&quot;In order to improve and accelerate ongoing live service development - and to better address player feedback and quality of life updates - we have reallocated studio resources and are no longer working on local campaign split-screen co-op,&quot; 343 said at the time, dashing the hopes of players who&#x27;d been patiently waiting to couch co-op the campaign with pals.

Now, however, it seems that players have found a menu glitch that permits them to add up to three additional local co-op players to their system; all you need is an Xbox Series S or X and a pal online, and this helpful walkthrough.

                              <span>Fan-favourite League of Legends animated spin-off Arcane has won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.

The show beat The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, What If…?, and Bob&#x27;s Burgers to secure the award. It is the first streaming series to win in that category.

&quot;Honoured doesn’t even begin to describe how we feel about winning the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program,&quot; the show&#x27;s official Twitter account posted earlier today.

                              <span>The Mortuary Assistant is the latest video game to be getting the silver screen treatment. 

The indie horror - which has been a huge hit since it launched at the beginning of August - was reportedly plucked for an adaptation before the full game released earlier this month. 

Director Jeremiah Kipp says the film will be a &quot;companion piece&quot; to the game, and Kipp hopes to &quot;retain the minimalist setting in and around the mortuary, the fascination with the process of embalming, and the nerve-shredding terror of the gameplay&quot;.

                              <span>Another day, another alleged Silent Hill leak. This one purports to be of Bloober Team&#x27;s alleged Silent Hill 2 remake.  

They&#x27;re incredibly small and incredibly bad quality, which means they&#x27;re impossible to confirm either way with any credible veracity, but the poster shared the images with the legend: &quot;First leaked image of Silent Hill 2 Remake supposedly developed by Bloober Team&quot;.

As for what they show? We seem to be looking at a third-person POV with the camera behind the left shoulder rather than a fixed angle. The third is the most compelling - it appears to be a bubble head nurse and reminds me of Brookhaven Hospital, when the nurse jumps out from near the elevator - whereas the top is reminiscent of the leaked concept art images we saw a few months back.

While currently only available to pre-order in Japan – sorry; we&#x27;ll let you know if and when it becomes available in Europe and beyond – the collection is currently up for sale on Amazon.co.jp, with each book priced at ¥4400 - that&#x27;s approximately £27 or £55 for the pair.

According to Famitsu (thanks, PC Gamer), a collector&#x27;s edition which includes both books and a framed Godfrey print is also available for ¥17,600, which is £108. It all comes in a &quot;special three-sided box&quot;.

A tweet posted by the official Gearbox account links to a week-long auction which currently features 47 lots. At the time of writing, all have active bids on them, although it&#x27;s impossible how much for, as every one is a &quot;blind bid&quot;.

&quot;Gearbox fans may have noticed the loud shirts worn by our head honcho over the years,&quot; Gearbox tweeted. &quot;Now these shirts can be yours!

                              <span>Apex Legends has set another record, setting a new minimum daily peak count of 329,041 players on Steam last month.

As that only reflects the number of players on Steam and doesn&#x27;t account for the thousands of players hot-dropping on console, too, it&#x27;s a significant milestone for Respawn&#x27;s fan-favourite battle royale, and is further bolstered by the shooter&#x27;s recently revised concurrent player peak, which was also broken earlier this month.

As evidenced on SteamDB and spotted by PCGN, in July, the minimum daily peak was 311,275, but in August jumped to 329,041 players.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal players who purchased Eternal Orbs via third-party sellers with real money have had their purchases revoked, leaving them with in-game debts.

As one of the key currencies in the game, Eternal Orbs are crucial to progression, and are bought with real money. However, players who have forked out for Eternal Orbs via third-party sellers - no doubt in a bid to try and save a bit of money; in-game, they cost £0.89 GBP ($0.99 USD) for 60 all the way up to £89.99 GBP ($99.99 USD) for 7200 - have had their Orbs revoked.

While there&#x27;s little doubt that the Eternal Orbs were sold contrary to Blizzard&#x27;s ToS and most players likely knew that going in, it&#x27;s had a devastating impact on some players and led to significant deficits that will prevent them from fully participating in the game until the &quot;debt&quot; is cleared.

In a tweet posted earlier today, Schofield - whose team is currently working on the upcoming sci-fi horror, The Callisto Protocol - talked about working 12-15 hours a day, six-seven days a week, and working over lunch and dinner, justifying it by saying &quot;you do it because you love it&quot;.

&quot;I only talk about the game during an event,&quot; Schofield said in the since deleted tweet. &quot;We [are] working six-seven days a week, nobody&#x27;s forcing us.

                              <span>The Quarry developer Supermassive has confirmed it&#x27;s already commenced work on its next game and yes, it&#x27;s going to be the &quot;same sort of horror&quot; as its predecessors.

In an interview with our friends at VGC, studio director Will Byles said that while he wasn&#x27;t sure &quot;how far [the team] could stretch the teen horror thing out further&quot;, another horror is on the way in either 2025 or 2026, and it will be the equivalent size of The Quarry rather than follow the episodic format of its anthology series, Dark Pictures.

“We’ve started working on [the next game],” studio director Will Byles told VGC. &quot;I can’t really tell you very much at all about it, but we have started. Again, it’s the same sort of horror genre, we’re sticking to that. It’s equivalent in size to The Quarry… and that’s about as much as I can say without giving too much away.

                              <span>University sim Two Point Campus has clocked up one million players in just a fortnight. 

Publisher Sega said its &quot;bags of charm and tongue-in-cheek comedy&quot; means the hit management sim has &quot;surpassed the milestone even faster than its much-loved predecessor, Two Point Hospital&quot;.

&quot;Two Point Campus was such a thrill to create so we’re ecstatic to see so many people enjoying the game as much as they do!&quot; said studio director, Mark Webley. &quot;We had high hopes that we had created something that fans would love, but the response has exceeded all expectations! We’d like to send a massive thank you to all of the players out there who are showing support by building their wild and wonderful campuses – we can’t wait to see what more you’ll create.&quot;

                              <span>In the run up to New Tales from the Borderlands&#x27; release on 21st October, developer Gearbox has shared 18 minutes of new gameplay footage, offering the best look yet at this long-awaited follow-up to Telltale Games&#x27; acclaimed original.


New Tales from the Borderlands follows the same choice-driven &quot;interactive fiction&quot; template as its predecessor - indeed, Gearbox has hired &quot;key alumni&quot; of the original Telltale Games narrative team for the project - but features three new protagonists in an all-new adventure. 


This time around, all eyes are on Fran Miscowicz - out for revenge after a Maliwan laser hits her frogurt shop - altruistic scientist Anuradha Dahr, and her ambitious &quot;streetwise&quot; brother Octavio Wallace-Dahr, who&#x27;s looking to make his own mark on the metropolis of Promethea.

                              <span>As governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of publisher Activision Blizzard grows - particularly in relation to its impact on PlayStation - Microsoft has revealed a commitment to keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms for &quot;at least several more years&quot; beyond Sony&#x27;s existing marketing contract.


That&#x27;s according to The Verge, which says the commitment was made in a letter from Xbox boss Phil Spencer to PlayStation head Jim Ryan earlier this year.


&quot;In January,&quot; Spencer told the publication in a statement, &quot;we provided a signed agreement to Sony to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract, an offer that goes well beyond typical gaming industry agreements&quot;.

                              <span>Developer 1047 Games has announced it will be &quot;ending feature development&quot; on its acclaimed free-to-play sci-fi shooter Splitgate in order to shift its focus to creating a new game in the same universe.


Splitgate - which has been described as &quot;Halo meets Portal&quot; in some quarters - made quite the splash last year. Despite having been around on PC since May 2019, an open crossplay beta for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC proved so popular that 1047 Games elected to delay the game&#x27;s multi-platform early access launch in order to better accommodate its unexpected surge in popularity.


1047 Games has continued to build on that success in the months since, most recently launching Splitgate&#x27;s beta season two in July. However, the developer has now said it will be &quot;ending feature development&quot; on the game as a result of what it seemingly considers to be insurmountable legacy issues.

                              <span>If your thirst for God of War Ragnarök news remains unsated, you might be interested in a brief new look at the game&#x27;s combat, which has been shared - bows a-twanging and axes a-bonking - in the run up to release on 9th November.


The 100-second clip comes courtesy of GameInformer, and features a bit of ultraviolence against new bipedal lizard foes known as Grims.


While a lot of it appears to be business as usual for God of War (Kratos still has his Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos, and Atreus retains his beloved bow and arrow), an accompanying write-up details some new combat additions, including Weapon Signature Moves.

Evercade&#x27;s new retro game handheld was announced earlier this year by Blaze Entertainment, and builds on past hardware by adding a better screen, built-in Wi-Fi, and a new pair of triggers. 


Today, we learned that it would also come with 14 Capcom arcade games and four more home console titles packed in, including Street Fighter 2: Hyper Fighting, Mega Man and Breath of Fire.

This tribute recognises the work of Visual Arts producer Daniel Kinnard, who passed away during the game&#x27;s production.


His image can be seen immortalised within the game, where the developer has been reimagined as a pro baseball player for the Denver Skulls on a poster adorning the walls of the farmhouse players search when looking for Ellie.

GoldenEye 007 has been given a Mario-inspired makeover, which sees a multitude of Koopas patrolling through a custom-made version of Nintendo 64&#x27;s Bomb-omb Battlefield with KF7 Soviet rifles and hand grenades.
Of course, the turtle-like foot soldiers and their Bob-omb comrades do not stand a chance against this Bond-like Mario protagonist and his own weaponary.

Riley and Rochelle from Sheinman Games will take players on a deductive journey, following the lives of two singers from two different backgrounds who fall in love... and also fall apart.


Players will create their own documentary about the two stars as they &quot;take a nuanced yet insider look at the pop culture world&quot; of the &#x27;90s. Diary entries, along with a catalogue of Riley and Rochelle&#x27;s older records, will work as a framework for the narrative, with the developer stating &quot;the player will choose how they want the film to end, and who gets to come out on top.&quot; Here&#x27;s a trailer:

Developer Nicholas John Leonhard Groissen took it upon himself to use his game as a platform to spout these comments in a recent &#x27;update&#x27; announcing Domina&#x27;s new name - Dominus.

Nintendo&#x27;s smartphone version of Mario Kart currently allows you to dump currency into an in-game warp pipe in exchange for randomised rewards, such as characters and karts. 


This will soon be replaced by a Fortnite-style rotating item shop, where you can exchange currency for items directly.

                              <span>G2 Esports has announced a brand new all-female League of Legends team, one of the first of its kind.


The team, called Hel, is named after Norse mythology&#x27;s goddess of death and includes the elite players Olivia &quot;Olizia&quot; Nnenna Calistus, Agnė &quot;Karina&quot; Ivaškevičiūtė, Alena &quot;TIFA&quot; Maurer, Maya &quot;Caltys&quot; Henckel and Ève &quot;Colomblbl&quot; Monvoisin.


It follows the similarly all-female Valorant team G2 Gozen formed last year and proves G2&#x27;s commitment to boosting the visibility of women in esports and to eventually empower men and women to compete together in future.

This article introduces the Container Object Storage Interface (COSI), a standard for provisioning and consuming object storage in Kubernetes. It is an alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.25.
File and block storage are treated as first class citizens in the Kubernetes ecosystem via Container Storage Interface (CSI). Workloads using CSI volumes enjoy the benefits of portability across vendors and across Kubernetes clusters without the need to change application manifests. An equivalent standard does not exist for Object storage.
Object storage has been rising in popularity in recent years as an alternative form of storage to filesystems and block devices. Object storage paradigm promotes disaggregation of compute and storage. This is done by making data avail…</span>

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s acclaimed Medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is set to make its historical tapestry a little richer next Thursday, 8th September, with the arrival of the Friends and Foes Event Pack DLC, promising over a hundred new events.


These new player-driven stories, which can be encountered throughout ordinary play, all have relationships at their heart, but not necessarily the positive kind. One the one hand, players can &quot;uncover novel ways to become pals with those [they] hold dear or even achieve the coveted best friend status&quot;, but on the other, Paradox says players should &quot;be prepared for ever more dangerous rivals, sharpening their vengeful knives to get back at you.&quot;


Stories are at the heart of Crusader Kings 3, so more narrative options are always welcome, but those uninterested in laying down cash for the Friends &amp; Foes Event Pack will also have something to look forward to - a number of additional free features and changes will be arriving simultaneously as part of the new 1.7 Bastion Update.

                              <span>It&#x27;s fair to say that eyebrows were both raised and furrowed when Sega first shared footage of Sonic Frontiers back in June, but its latest trailer - a three-minute overview video breaking down the various features and gameplay flow of Sonic&#x27;s latest adventure - offers the clearest explanation yet of how things will unfold come its launch on 8th November if you&#x27;re still a little puzzled by the whole thing.


Granted, Sega&#x27;s plentiful, if scattershot, drip-feed of information over the last few months means none of the information in today&#x27;s trailer is particularly new, but it&#x27;s certainly more digestible - and understandable - than trying to mentally scoop together a picture of Sonic Frontiers from countless previews and reveals.


The gist, then, is that having somehow found his way into a strange dimension known as Cyber Space, Sonic escapes to Kronos - one of the Starfall Islands where players will be able to embark on Frontiers&#x27; non-linear &quot;open zone&quot; gameplay. Here, high-speed exploration and puzzling are the order of the day, with successful puzzling unlocking items that&#x27;ll increase Sonic&#x27;s power and defence and revealing new parts of each map.

                              <span>Warner Bros. is teasing the imminent arrival of Gremlins&#x27; adorable mogwai Gizmo to its free-to-play crossover fighter MultiVersus, with the company&#x27;s announcement pointing to a release next Tuesday, 6th September.


Although Warner Bros. is yet to officially namecheck Gizmo, a teaser trailer released today on Twitter shows a pair of very Gizmo-like hands and eyes popping out of the distinctive box used to transport the character in Gremlins and Gremlins 2: The New Batch.


What makes the Gizmo tease particularly interesting is that (despite his inclusion in the playable roster having been leaked earlier this year) the only Gremlins character so for officially confirmed for MultiVersus is Gizmo&#x27;s arch-nemesis Stripe.
