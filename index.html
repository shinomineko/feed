                              <span>Pokémon has apologised for putting &quot;the cart before the Mudsdale&quot; and walked back an announcement that had confirmed Pokémon Home version 3.0.0. – which connect the latest Pokémon games to the service – would be available from 24th May 2023.

Earlier this week, we reported that the latest Pokémon games for Nintendo Switch will finally connect to cloud service Pokémon Home following an update due next Wednesday, 24th May. Now, however, the official Pokémon website says that &quot;the actual release date is yet to be announced&quot;. 

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet first arrived in November last year, and until now have been unable to connect to Pokémon Home, the service which lets you transfer creatures to and from other Pokémon games.

                              <span>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now Japan&#x27;s seventh biggest game launch of all time.

According to Game Data Library – self-described as &quot;the largest collection of Japanese games sales on the internet&quot; – it has surpassed the launches of huge games across all platforms, including Final Fantasy 7, Pokémon Sun/Moon, and Monster Hunter: World. 

Only Pokémon Scarlet/Violet – which holds the top spot – Splatoon 3, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokémon Black/White, Final Fantasy 8, and Dragon Quest 9 have shifted more copies in Japan at launch (thanks, mynintendonews).

                              <span>Crypt of the NecroDancer studio Brace Yourself Games has confirmed it has laid off half its staff.

As spotted by Game Developer, senior producer Crystal Savin posted a notice to Twitter stating that the workforce had been cut by &quot;50 per cent&quot;. Studio founder Ryan Clare and director of communications Madeline Gray later retweeted Savin&#x27;s tweet, essentially confirming the layoffs.

&quot;Yesterday, senior management at Brace Yourself Games made the incredibly difficult decision to lay off a portion of the company’s staff,&quot; Brace Yourself Games told PC Gamer. &quot;This decision was not made lightly, as we deeply value our talented and dedicated employees.

                              <span>The Wonderful 101: Remastered&#x27;s After School Hero DLC - which was promised as a Kickstarter stretch goal back in 2020 - has now arrived, and it&#x27;s free to download on PlayStation and PC.


After School Hero was one of several stretch goals detailed when developer PlatinumGames opted to take a remastered version of Wii U cult classic The Wonderful 101 to Kickstarter back on 2020, and promised a side-scrolling adventure focused on a &quot;young hero&quot; named Luka.


The Wonderful 101: Remastered&#x27;s other DLC stretch goal, a Time Attack mode, launched back in 2021, so it&#x27;s been a bit of a wait for the DLC originally referred to as &quot;Luka&#x27;s First Mission&quot;.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 is finally official after several weeks of teases, but a few mysteries still remain. And it looks like Amazon might have inadvertently solved one of those ahead of schedule by leaking the characters included in the game&#x27;s Kombat Pack DLC.


Mortal Kombat 1 - which, as rumoured, will be a reboot of sorts, taking place in a &quot;reborn&quot; universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang - is set to release on 19th September, and it&#x27;ll be accompanied by a Kombat Pack providing early access to six additional playable characters and five assist characters known as Kameo Fighters.


At the time of Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s announcement, publisher Warner Bros. confirmed the Kombat Pack would be included in Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s Premium and Kollector&#x27;s Editions, but neglected to tell prospective purchasers what additional characters they&#x27;d get in return for their money.

                              <span>If your ears, like mine, find Sonic CD&#x27;s Sonic Boom or Sonic the Hedgehog 3&#x27;s Ice Cap Zone Act 1 theme to be like soothing lullabies whispered from a distant past, then you might be interested in the Sonic Symphony World Tour, which is turning some of the series&#x27; best-loved tunes into a live concert starting at London&#x27;s Barbican in September.


Described as an &quot;immersive live experience that celebrates more than three decades of music from Sega&#x27;s iconic mascot&quot;, Sonic Symphony promises a &quot;musical tour&quot; through the series&#x27; history. It&#x27;ll feature &quot;classic 8-bit and 16-bit tunes to rock and EDM songs&quot;, all played by a full symphony orchestra and rock band - and accompanied by on-screen Sonic footage for the benefit of those requiring eye stimulation along with the amusement to their ears.


Sega and show organiser MGP Live have announced two dates for the Sonic Symphony World Tour so far, beginning with a performance at London&#x27;s Barbican Hall on 16th September this year. After that, it&#x27;ll depart the UK and head over to the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, for a second show on 30th September.

Many publishers have adopted this $70 price point as standard, including the likes of Sony, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Earlier this week, Sega also suggested it could adopt a similar approach for its future releases, and stated it was &quot;keeping an eye on market conditions&quot;.


As for those who have already increased prices to this higher point, Zelnick claimed he hasn&#x27;t seen any real resistance from players so far.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below.



During the events of Burning Shores, Aloy meets Seyka, an &quot;ambitious marine of the Quen tribe who has stepped up to help her people survive&quot;. Ahead of the DLC&#x27;s release, Seyka was touted as a character that would be Aloy&#x27;s equal, with actress Ashly Burch even saying &quot;Aloy may have met her match&quot;.

                              <span>Legendary game developer John Carmack has defended his decision to attend a science fiction and fantasy convention for &quot;non-leftist&quot; writers, following social media criticism.


Carmack announced he would attend BasedCon this week via Twitter, prompting displeasure from followers upset at the event&#x27;s description as an alternative to the &quot;publishing industry&#x27;s hostility to authors who are critical of progressive dogma&quot;. 


The event&#x27;s name stems from the internet slang &quot;based&quot;, which BasedCon&#x27;s own About page describes as &quot;the opposite of social justice activism&quot; and identified by &quot;based beliefs&quot; such as &quot;discriminating against white people is racism&quot;, &quot;men cannot give birth&quot;, and also &quot;guns don&#x27;t kill people, people kill people&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard has detailed the accessibility features that have been implemented in the forthcoming Diablo 4.


A new blog post lists the major features relating to dexterity assistance, text assistance, and vision assistance.



Said lead accessibility designer Drew McCrory: &quot;The only limitation to adventuring in Sanctuary should be interest, not capability.&quot;

The patch itself is minimal, fixing &quot;several issues&quot; to &quot;improve the gameplay experience&quot;, as well as an issue with the main quest &#x27;The Closed Door&#x27; that prevented players from completing it (I am not that far, but if you know, you know).


More interesting is that the game&#x27;s item duplication glitches remain intact.

Nintendo has typically left Link and Zelda&#x27;s relationship up to players&#x27; own interpretations, and gives the series&#x27; two main characters only a limited amount of screentime together. 


Now, voice actress Patricia Summersett has discussed her take on the character, after voicing Zelda in Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom and spin-off Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.

                              <span>Nintendo has announced the next batch of Game Boy Advance titles for its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service. 


On 26th May, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will get their hands on Super Mario Advance, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2, and Yoshi&#x27;s Island: Super Mario Advance 3. 


In Super Mario Advance, players are tasked with launching a load of vegetables and other items at their enemies, in order to reign victorious. This is the Game Boy Advance version of Super Mario Bros. 2 - the game that introduced the world to Nintendo&#x27;s pink, bow wearing, anthropomorphic dinosaur, Birdo. Birdo is a bit of a favourite here at Eurogamer, and you can find out more about her in our article dedicated to the Nintendo icon here.

                              <span>Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to Adeline Software&#x27;s much-loved Little Big Adventure series, recently announced it was working on a ground-up &quot;remaster&quot; of both titles, and we&#x27;ve now been given a tiny glimpse of the Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up in action.


The original Little Big Adventure, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, released back in 1994 and delivered a memorable blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock. A sequel then followed three years later.


2.21 first discussed its plans to remaster Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 back in March, explaining it was taking on the projects while it continued discussions with publishers to make its previously announced Little Big Adventure reboot a reality.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been gripped to your seat in agonised anticipation since blasting through the first eight episodes of Sonic Prime back in December, you&#x27;ll no doubt be thrilled to hear the next lot is coming to Netflix on 13th July.


When Sonic Prime was announced back in February 2021, Netflix described it as a 24-episode animated series that would send Sonic on a &quot;journey of self-discovery and redemption&quot; in which the &quot;fate of a strange new multiverse&quot; was in his hands.


Sonic Prime&#x27;s initial batch of episodes saw Sonic traversing the Shatterverse - a collection of alternative dimensions formed after Dr. Eggman&#x27;s Paradox Prism was destroyed in battle - in a quest to restore the universe, all with a little help from different versions of his familiar friends.

                              <span>Maquette, the striking &quot;recursive&quot; first-person puzzle adventure from developer Graceful Decay and publisher Annapurna Interactive, is making its way to Switch next week, on 25th May.


Originally released for PlayStation and PC back in 2021, Maquette builds an ingenious series of spatial challenges inspired by the small-scale sculptors&#x27; models that give the game its name.


Maquettes are sculptures crafted before embarking on a full-scale project, and in Graceful Decay&#x27;s puzzler, that&#x27;s reflected in environments that contain smaller versions of themselves. Crucially in Maquette, changes made to one environment affect the other - so if you were to, say, place a cube in a tiny courtyard in front of you, it would then materialise in the full-size courtyard you stand in, giving you a means to progress to the next area - and on it goes.

                              <span>PowerWash Simulator is about to get a whole lot wetter as the wonderful hose-&#x27;em-up heads to the depths of the ocean as part of a new SpongeBob crossover DLC, arriving this &quot;summer&quot;.


Details on PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s SpongeBob SquarePants Special Pack are slim at present, but a teaser video announcing the crossover does offer a glimpse of a player taking in the sights of an unusually mucky Bikini Bottom, nozzle in hand.


Although PowerWash Simulator has recieved a couple of free crossovers previously - whisking players to Tomb Raider&#x27;s Croft Manor and Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s Midgar - SpongeBob will be the first in a series of paid Special Pack DLC crossovers, which were announced as part of developer FuturLab&#x27;s 2023 content roadmap back in April.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima&#x27;s Death Stranding is the latest free game available to claim via the Epic Game Store. 


The open-world sci-fi delivery simulator, sorry, &quot;Strand&quot; game, typically costs £24, so this is a decent saving. Nab it for yourself via this Epic Game Store link, until 25th May at 4pm UK time.


Before you do that, it&#x27;s worth flagging a few other Epic Game Store bits which have been announced today, including a five percent credit on purchases made through the Store.

Similarly to Hypnospace Outlaw, Slayers X is aiming to capture the 1990s but this time as a first-person shooter. You can take a look in the reveal video below.

&quot;We talk a lot about Game Pass because subscription is the latest option that we scaled: you have pay-to-play, then there was free-to-play, and then we introduced Game Pass,&quot; Sarah Bond, corporate vice president for game creator experience and ecosystem at Xbox, told Rolling Stone UK.

&quot;We&#x27;ve talked about how we&#x27;re experimenting with other models, like what does it mean for advertising in games which is more prevalent in mobile – are there models of that that work well in PC and console? Are there other models where you might have timed slices of games and stuff like that?

SM2, as this project was known, was a Call of Duty client based off the Modern Warfare 2 engine, complete with maps and weapons from across the series. 


However, despite the evident dedication from all involved with SM2, the team has been forced to &quot;[shut] down operations permanently&quot;, after it received a cease and desist letter from Call of Duty publisher, Activision.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet first arrived in November last year, and until now have been unable to connect to Pokémon Home, the service which lets you transfer creatures to and from other Pokémon games. 


That all changes next week, when Scarlet and Violet will gain Home compatibility. This means being able to import any supported creature from any of the mainline games supported by Home at present, alongside the previous storage service Pokémon Bank, and also Pokémon Go.

                              <span>Acclaimed puzzle game The Case of the Golden Idol is coming to Nintendo Switch. After a period of PC exclusivity, the murder mystery head scratcher will be making its console debut next Thursday 25th May. 


On its release, Switch players will be able to experience all of the game&#x27;s redacted and perplexing scenarios in a whole new way, thanks to touchscreen controls. For those who don&#x27;t want to get their screens all mucky, however, there is also a custom developed controller layout option for gathering up evidence. This Switch release also boasts an overhauled UI, for the &quot;best user experience&quot; when playing the game in either docked or handheld mode. 


As well as the base game, Switch owners will also have the opportunity to get their hands on Golden Idol&#x27;s first expansion - The Spider of Lanka. This DLC kicks off a year before The Case of the Golden Idol&#x27;s first scenario, and follows the story of Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller as they make their maiden voyage to the Kingdom of Lanka.

                              <span>Killer Instinct, the 2013 soft reboot for the fighting series, is receiving an update - as the game&#x27;s servers undergo a legacy migration.  
The update was revealed in a blog post by developer Iron Galaxy yesterday, along with information on what players can expect as the migration takes place.
&quot;It has become more challenging to deal with issues that crop up due to [Killer Instinct]&#x27;s reliance on legacy services,&quot; the developer said.

As expected, Mortal Kombat 1 is a reboot of sorts (developer NetherRealm has rebooted Mortal Kombat a number of times over the years), set in a &quot;reborn&quot; universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang who ended up victorious at the end of Mortal Kombat 11.


Mortal Kombat 1 has a brand new story featuring familiar characters, NetherRealm said. The debut trailer is below (be warned, things get very gory):

                              <span>Nvidia has officially unveiled its first mid-range Ada Lovelace graphics card, the RTX 4060 Ti, with both 8GB and 16GB variants at $399/£389 and $499 respectively. The 8GB card is the first to be released, with sales beginning on May 24th, while the 16GB variant debuts in July. The firm also detailed its mainstream RTX 4060 GPU, also coming in July, to debut at $299. 
All three models ought to offer a reasonable boost in performance over their predecessors, while also adding DLSS 3 frame generation - which is perhaps more impactful on mid-range hardware than it is on the likes of the RTX 4090 which is powerful enough without it. That should allow the 4060 family to be a reasonable choice for gaming at 1080p with maxed settings (including RT / DLSS), or at 1440p with some settings reductions. 
On average, Nvidia is claiming the 4060 Ti is 1.15x faster than the 3060 Ti and 1.6x faster than the 2060 Super (1.7x and 2.6x faster with DLSS 3). Similarly, the RTX 4060 is 1.2x faster than RTX 3060 and 1.6x faster than RTX 2060 (1.7x and 2.3x with DLSS 3).

Originally slated for the first half of 2023, early access will now begin this autumn.


&quot;The reason for the release shift is simple: the playtest process is working,&quot; said Flynn in a new developer update video detailing the delay (see below).

But, of course, this isn&#x27;t the only Lord of the Rings MMO out there. Word of Amazon&#x27;s plans inevitably sparked questions around what might happen to the already existing and well-established MMO The Lord of the Rings Online from Middle-earth Enterprises and Standing Stone Games.

Will the two struggle to co-exist? No, says Amazon Games&#x27; vice president Christoph Hartmann.

                              <span>UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt has called upon the country&#x27;s regulator to understand its &quot;wider responsibilities&quot; to promote economic growth, following its recent block of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout.


The remarks, reported by The Telegraph, follow questions from MPs this week directed at bosses of the Competition and Markets Authority regarding the decision which has scuppered Microsoft&#x27;s ambitions here in the UK - and potentially worldwide.


Both Microsoft and Activision have criticised the UK for disrupting the deal, and have labelled the country as being &quot;bad for business&quot; post-Brexit. The remarks come in stark contrast to the vision for the UK&#x27;s tech industry previously set out by Hunt and UK prime minister Rishi Sunak to become the &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; of Europe.

                              <span>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom players have discovered multiple glitches to duplicate items.


One involves fusing an item using the bow, while another allows players to duplicate weapons and shields. Both involve exiting and entering the pause menu at high speed.


Both methods potentially allow for infinite copies of certain items, whether you&#x27;re seeking powerful ammo and weapons, or want to sell items for extra Rupees.

                              <span>Nvidia has announced the first Xbox PC games to hit GeForce Now, its cloud gaming service.
The addition of Xbox titles to GeForce is just one of the many deals Microsoft has struck during its campaign to acquire Activision Blizzard.
In February, Microsoft president Brad Smith announced the 10-year partnership with Nvidia after a hearing at the European Commission.

iTunes has listed the film as being able to own from 22nd May here in the UK. 


Currently, iTunes appears to be the only place listing a purchase date for those of us in Blighty. I checked elsewhere and YouTube and Amazon Prime both have the film available to pre-order, but no release date. Netflix just sends you to its Sonic Prime animated series.

Blizzard&#x27;s upcoming action RPG guides the player through its various zones as they make progress on the campaign, and here it should feel like you&#x27;re a little more powerful than the creatures you face.

&quot;We don&#x27;t want a part of the game to ever become utterly trivial, such that there&#x27;s no reason to return to that place,&quot; associate game director Joe Piepiora explained to Eurogamer in an interview.

As spotted by IGN, publisher Take-Two is predicting it will generate an absolutely staggering $8B in net bookings for its 2025 fiscal year (beginning April 2024), as it launches &quot;several groundbreaking titles&quot;. That&#x27;s a significant jump up from the $5.3B it&#x27;s just reported for its financial year 2023, and an even bigger leap from the $3.5B it reported in the year prior, suggesting something major is due between next April and March 2025.


&quot;For the last several years, we have been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success,&quot; Take-Two wrote in its earnings report.

First released for iOS in 2019 - and later for Android, Switch, and PlayStation - Sky: Children of the Light is a bit of an unusual thing, blending all sorts of elements to create a delicate adventure spanning the seven realms of a beautiful kingdom located among the clouds.


There are puzzley-platformy bits, story vignettes, as well as live-service staples like a season pass, and it&#x27;s all build around a gently collaborative multiplayer core, designed to encourage &quot;compassion, friendship, and altruism&quot;.

                              <span>BlizzCon is back this November, with its first in-person event since 2019 following several years of digital-only events and no-shows as Blizzard navigated a pandemic and workplace controversy.


As announced on the Blizzard website, BlizzCon 2023 will take place from 3rd-4th November at California&#x27;s Anaheim Convention Center. Beyond that, details are fairly non-existent at present, but the studio says it&#x27;ll have news on &quot;ticketing information, cosplay and other competition details, and more&quot; next month.


BlizzCon 2023 will mark the show&#x27;s first in-person event in four years, following two highly controversial showings in 2018 and 2019 - the first playing host to Blizzard&#x27;s infamously bungled reveal of free-to-play mobile game Diablo Immortal and the second featuring a limp non-apology from then-CEO J. Allen Brack, who failed to offer much in the way of a convincing response after Blizzard suspended a Hearthstone player for expressing pro-Hong Kong views.

                              <span>Twitch is today launching a new Alerts feature, to help creators personalise their streams.


Most streamers will have alerts for new followers, subscribers, and more, but these are usually created using third-party apps like Streamlabs.


Twitch&#x27;s Alerts feature will allow streamers to create and edit alerts directly within Twitch, to acknowledge key interactions including hype trains, goals, raids, charity donations, and more.

                              <span>After a month of teases, it looks like tomorrow&#x27;s the day the next Mortal Kombat game - not Mortal Kombat 12, according to reports - will get its official reveal.


Series developer NetherRealm has now released a short video teasing some unspecified announcement tomorrow, 18th May, at 2pm BST/6am PT. And given its title - &quot;Tomorrow is a new dawn&quot; - and its arrival after a bunch of teases hinting at a reveal for the next Mortal Kombat, it doesn&#x27;t seem too farfetched to assume that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;ll get.


As you&#x27;ll no doubt have noticed if you&#x27;ve been riding the hype train so far, NetherRealm&#x27;s latest video features the same time-based imagery seen in its previous trailers - the most recent of which saw a ticking clock gradually approach &#x27;12&#x27; before leapfrogging it entirely to land on &#x27;1&#x27;.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) is a feature-rich
operator for Kubernetes to make managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles easier than ever. Recording those profiles from scratch is one
of the key features of this operator, which usually involves the integration
into large CI/CD systems. Being able to test the recording capabilities of the
operator in edge cases is one of the recent development efforts of the SPO and
makes it excitingly easy to play around with seccomp profiles.
Recording seccomp profiles with spoc record
The v0.8.0 release of the Security Profiles Operator shipped a new
command line interface called spoc, a little helper tool for recording and
replaying seccomp profiles among various other things that are out of scope of
this blog post.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been an extremely long wait for Jagged Alliance 3 - series fans have been patiently twiddling their thumbs for almost 20 years at this point - but finally, the turn-based tactical RPG threequel has a release date and will be launching for PC on 14th July.


Jagged Alliance 3 was initially announced all the way back in 2004, when televisions still had dials and text messages were conveyed by pigeons. At the time, Russian studio MiST Land South was attached as its developer, but after that arrangement failed to reach fruition, original publisher Strategy First went through a succession of studios with similarly unsuccessful results before the Jagged Alliance rights changed hands in 2010.


Five years later, the rights pinballed again, this time to Nordic Games, and six years after that, THQ Nordic revealed that finally, finally, development on a third entry in the Jagged Alliance series would resume, this time under the watch of Tropico developer Haemimont Games.

Following the launch of this first episode, the game&#x27;s following four episodes will then be released every two weeks, with the developer promising an Expanse experience &quot;like never before&quot;.


The Expanse: A Telltale Series has been developed by Telltale and Deck Nine (Life is Strange: True Colors) and serves as a prequel to the popular sci-fi TV show. It features Camina Drummer as the main protagonist. Drummer works on The Artemis spaceship and, as you&#x27;d expect from a Telltale game, players will be tasked with making some tough decisions as she and her scavenger crew negotiate their way through the edges of The Belt.

Earlier this year, a court in Hermagor ruled that the football game&#x27;s FUT packs violated the country&#x27;s gambling laws. At this time, lawyer Ulrich Salburg stated the plaintiffs - which included one minor - had allegedly &quot;gambled away&quot; hundreds of euros on FUT packs when the uncertain monetary value of the packs purportedly violated the Austrian Gaming Act.


Consequently, the court alleged that the controversial loot boxes could be classified as &quot;illegal gambling&quot;.

Accessible via the Dead Space remake&#x27;s Steam page, the new 90-minute trial version requires players to first install the full game then hit the &quot;play now&quot; button to begin their free trial period, whereupon a timer will keep track of the minutes still remaining.


There doesn&#x27;t appear to be a progression cap on the trial, meaning players are free to continue as far as they can before their hour and a half expires.

                              <span>Blizzard has cancelled Overwatch 2&#x27;s much-trumpeted but long-delayed PvE mode, admitting development &quot;hasn&#x27;t made the progress we would have hoped.&quot;


PvE was presented as a flagship feature of Overwatch 2 when the team-based shooter sequel was unveiled in 2019, but, as development dragged on and 2022 arrived, Blizzard announced it would be &quot;decoupling&quot; PvE from PvP in order to get the game into players&#x27; hands sooner.


To that end, a fully PvP-focused version of Overwatch 2 finally launched last October, and little has been heard about its once-key PvE component in the months since. Now though, in a newly aired developer livestream, Overwatch 2 executive producer Jared Neuss has confirmed the game&#x27;s PvE mode is officially dead.

                              <span>Ubisoft has detailed plans expand its Assassin&#x27;s Creed team by 40% &quot;over the coming years&quot; as it seeks to focus its resources on &quot;big brands and long-lasting Live games&quot;.


The news comes as part of the publisher&#x27;s Financial Year 2023 earnings report, the first earnings report since its disappointing quarterly update in January, in which it announced an &quot;increased cautiousness over the coming years&quot; and the cancellation of three unannounced projects.


In today&#x27;s end-of-year report, Ubisoft recorded net bookings of €1.74B, marking an 18% year-on-year decrease for the publisher, but there were some notable wins for its biggest franchises, including a record number of active users for the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise over the last year, coming it at 44% higher than Origins and 19% higher than Odyssey.

The BlackLotus bootkit is the first-known real-world malware that can bypass Secure Boot protections, allowing for the execution of malicious code before your PC begins loading Windows and its many security protections. Secure Boot has been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet the software’s system requirements.
Microsoft says that the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with either physical access to a system or administrator rights on a system. It can affect physical PCs and virtual machines with Secure Boot enabled...</span>

                              <span>Blizzard has said it&#x27;s feeling &quot;really confident&quot; Diablo 4 will enjoy a smooth launch following a series of server stress tests.


The developer held a &quot;Server Slam&quot; event over the weekend to test the upcoming action role-playing game&#x27;s servers one final time ahead of launch in June. The event seemed to go smoothly, with most players reporting little to no queue time and, when in-game, improved performance compared to that seen in previous tests.


Speaking to Eurogamer in an interview in London today, Diablo 4 art director John Mueller and associate game director Joe Piepiora said Blizzard is feeling good about the launch because it had learned so much from the various tests.

                              <span>Saudi Arabia&#x27;s controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF) has increased its stake in FIFA publisher EA.


According to Seeking Alpha (via Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz), a new filing regarding the fund was published yesterday (15th May). This filing was for the three months that ended on 31st March, and reveals the PIF purchased more shares in EA during Q4 2022.


Prior to this quarter, the PIF held 16.01m shares in EA. It has since increased this stake by 55 percent, and now holds 24.81m shares as of the end of Q1 2023.

These coveted items are typically held by players of mainline Pokémon games for the rarest of creatures. In Pokémon Go, what you use your Master Ball on will be up to you. 


Pokémon Go players will receive a Master Ball as part of this season&#x27;s ongoing story quest, with its final part set to debut next week on 22nd May at 10am local time.

CMA bosses Marcus Bokkerink and Sarah Cardell faced repeated questions from the UK government&#x27;s Business and Trade Committee this morning relating to the decision, just a day after the European Commission voted to approve the deal in the EU.


MPs asked the CMA to explain why it had reached a different decision on the deal to its European counterpart, and repeatedly questioned whether the CMA had considered the effects of blocking a deal like this on the UK&#x27;s international reputation.

                              <span>Shipment from Modern Warfare is one of Call of Duty&#x27;s most famous maps. So famous, it actually got a revamp for the likes of Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2 (where it was set on a ship).


Its somewhat simple design, which sees a collection of vacant containers for players to shoot their way around, is a mainstay of the series. However, the original map nearly didn&#x27;t make its way into Call of Duty at all. As hard as it is to imagine now, Shipment&#x27;s inclusion in 2007&#x27;s Modern Warfare was &quot;truly an accident&quot;.


Speaking to Dexerto, Infinity Ward multiplayer design director Geoff Smith shared more backstory on Shipment&#x27;s genesis.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lets you dress Link in a whole wardrobe of costumes and armour - but none so unsettling as his Link&#x27;s Awakening outfit.


The blank, unblinking eyes, the polished sheen of his mask&#x27;s surface - it all leads to Link looking like a serial killer. (And considering what some of you are doing to those poor Koroks, perhaps this isn&#x27;t too far off.)


This is, of course, Link&#x27;s design from the recent Nintendo Switch remake of classic Game Boy adventure The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening. Except there, it was part of the game&#x27;s cute toy diarama aesthetic. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link&#x27;s longer body and glassy-eyed expression give off a very different vibe.

                              <span>Stray, last year&#x27;s adorable game where you play as a cat in a cyberpunk world, looks to be pawing its way onto Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in the near future.


The game - currently a PlayStation console exclusive - has now received a new Xbox rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). 


As spotted by Twitter user @MACOS380, Stray has been rated as E for Everyone 10+, with the ESRB noting the game features animated blood and fantasy violence. &quot;Players sometimes encounter parasitic blobs/mice-like bots that can attack and kill the cat. Players can access a UV light to defeat the mice-like bots, causing them to explode and emit splashes of coloured liquid,&quot; the rating summary explains.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good long while since we first laid eyes on dreamy Ecuadorian football adventure Despelote, but now, after several years away from the spotlight, it&#x27;s resurfaced with a publisher and a planned 2024 release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.


Created by Julián Cordero and Sebastian Valbuena, Despelote is described as a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life adventure about &quot;childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001&quot;. It&#x27;s set during a period when the country&#x27;s football team was on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time, helping instil a sense of hope in a population still reeling from a major financial crisis. 


That translates to &quot;bittersweet and sometimes dreamy&quot; game of kick-abouts and conversations, in which sees players - viewing the world through the eyes and ears of eight-year-old Julián - explore a dense corner of Quito, &quot;full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to&quot;.

                              <span>Five years after free-to-play multiplayer mech shooter Hawken was pulled offline following a tumultuous development, the brand is being revived by 505 Games as the PvE-focused, and initially single-player, Hawken Reborn.


The original Hawken burst onto the scene back in 2011 with an eye-catching work-in-progress trailer, but it struggled to find an audience once out in the real world. A failed early access attempt in 2014 saw development stall until a &quot;relaunch&quot; in 2017, but even that wasn&#x27;t enough to get bums in mechs, and the game&#x27;s PC servers were yanked for good the following year.


Which does make Hawken something of an odd choice for a revival, but here we are, five years later, with the free-to-play Hawken Reborn now listed on Steam and poised to launch into early access as a &quot;genuinely early-in-development&quot; title this Wednesday, 17th May.

                              <span>Just 12 months after its full launch, development is ending on free-to-play battle royale game Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodhunt, with its developer Sharkmob blaming the title&#x27;s failure &quot;reach the critical mass needed&quot; to continue support.


Bloodhunt was announced toward the end of 2020 and, following a limited Steam early access release, recieved its full launch on PlayStation and PC last April. It offered players a vampiric spin on the well-worn battle royale formula, setting them loose across the rain-soaked, moon-drenched streets and rooftops of Prague, armed with supernatural parkour abilities and other clan-specific powers - plus, rather more boringly, guns.


It made for an interesting twist on a familiar genre - even if Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese didn&#x27;t much like the whole shooty thing when he played it back in early access - but that clearly wasn&#x27;t enough to attact and retain the kind of player base Bloodhunt needed.

                              <span>The Molasses Flood, the CD-Projekt-owned studio currently working on The Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, has been hit by layoffs following the game&#x27;s recent reboot.


Development on Project Sirius - previously described as a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience - was confirmed to have stalled back in March, after CD Projekt re-evaluated the &quot;scope and commercial potential of the original concept&quot;. At the time, the company told investors it was &quot;formulating a new framework&quot; for the game that was better &quot;aligned with [its] strategy&quot;.


Last week, CD Projekt shared an update on Project Sirius, announcing its &quot;work on defining a new framework&quot; was now complete. But that news was followed by growing reports of layoffs at the Boston-based The Molasses Flood, which was acquired by CD Projekt in 2021, with the studio&#x27;s technical narrative designer Robert Bailey, environment artist Eleanore Falck, senior environment artist and world builder Gannon Jasper, and art producer Caryn M. Boehm, all revealing they had lost their jobs in tweets shared since last week.

                              <span>Having left us a vague &quot;June&quot; launch window for its Layers of Fear remake over the last few months, developer Bloober Team is finally ready to talk specifics, confirming its &quot;psychedelic horror chronicle&quot; will be releasing for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 15th June.


Layers of Fear is a bit of an unusual proposition, taking Bloober Team&#x27;s two previous Layers of Fear titles (as well as the first game&#x27;s Inheritance DLC), then reimagining it all as a single, interlinking narrative, featuring striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals, new gameplay elements - including a lantern to ward off shadowy terrors - and expanded plot lines.


This time around, the familiar unravellings of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece and a legendary actor making one final movie on a labyrinthine ocean liner - as featured in Layers of Fear 1 and 2 respectively - are accompanied by a new &quot;story chapter&quot; following the painter&#x27;s rarely seen wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer, tying the whole thing together.

With Kubernetes 1.27, we (SIG Auth) are moving Key Management Service (KMS) v2 API to beta.
What is KMS?
One of the first things to consider when securing a Kubernetes cluster is encrypting etcd data at
rest. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to

                              <span>Amazon has announced fresh plans to adapt The Lord of the Rings into a new MMO &quot;adventure&quot;, developed in-house by the studio behind New World, for PC and consoles.


The project will feature &quot;the beloved stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings&quot;, adapted from Tolkien&#x27;s original books, as licensed by rights owner Embracer. (Don&#x27;t expect this to tie-in specifically with the Peter Jackson movie trilogy, or even Amazon&#x27;s own Rings of Power show, set a thousand years before.)


&quot;Bringing players a fresh take on The Lord of the Rings has long been an aspiration for our team, and we&#x27;re honoured and grateful that Middle-earth Enterprises is entrusting us with this iconic world,&quot; Amazon Games boss Christoph Harmann said. &quot;We&#x27;re also pleased to be expanding our relationship with Embracer Group following our Tomb Raider deal last year, as they&#x27;ve proven to be excellent collaborators.&quot;

                              <span>Water features a lot in video games - Bertie even ran a Five of the Best supporter&#x27;s piece on it earlier this year. But how do developers actually make it look so, well, water-like?


According to 3D artist Thomas of Twitter account Stylized Station, there is a lot involved to get it just right. It takes &quot;a ton of smoke and mirrors in the background, without anyone ever realising it,&quot; they explained in a very thorough Twitter thread, noting &quot;creating real-time simulated water is still really hard to do&quot;.


Thomas stated that most developers use a variety of &quot;cheats&quot; and techniques that see things such as textures, VFX sprites, normal maps, and basic geometry &quot;smashed together&quot; in order to give the &quot;illusion of flowing water&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s stalled Activision Blizzard buyout received some positive news today, as the EU offered its approval. 


The European Commission had been one of three major regulators standing in the way of the deal, alongside the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - the latter of which dramatically blocked the deal last month, dealing a sizable blow to it succeeding overall. Microsoft is now set to appeal that decision.


In Brussels, however, it&#x27;s better news for Microsoft - after a couple of concessions ended up winning over EU regulators.

Not only that, Diablo YouTuber and streamer wudijo beat the boss with a hardcore character on the veteran difficulty.


Let&#x27;s put this achievement into context: Ashava is a raid-style boss meant to offer a group of 12 players a stiff challenge that must be completed within a 15-minute time limit. wudijo downed Ashava on his own.

                              <span>It is not just Koroks that are getting transported around Hyrule in a myriad of unusual ways thanks to Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s new Ultrahand ability. Link is also making his merry way through Hyrule&#x27;s many regions and camps in a range of eclectic creations, from mechs to trucks and tanks.


As a reminder, Link&#x27;s new Ultrahand ability allows players to pick up, move, and rotate objects. These objects can then be fused to other objects, and with a bit of creativity players can conjure up their own vehicles and such to beetle across Hyrule. 


While I have been happy enough to just place a fan on the back of my timber board to make it go, others clearly have a much better imagination (and a lot more patience, I won&#x27;t lie, I am still finding Ultrahand quite fiddly to get the hang of) than I do. As a result, there have been some truly remarkable Ultrahand designs making the rounds online.

                              <span>Koroks are back in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. As with its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, Link can search the lands of Hyrule to find these woodland spirits, and return the seeds to Hestu. As in Breath of the Wild, Hestu will then add these seeds to his prized maracas, do a little shimmy, and grant you a new weapon slot. It&#x27;s all very wholesome. 


Or, at least it was in Breath of the Wild. However, Tears of the Kingdom has upped the ante when it comes to Korok puzzles. This time around, Link often has to reunite two separated Korok companions. This sounds innocent enough - who doesn&#x27;t want to see two long lost friends reunited? Well, apparently many Tears of the Kingdom players, that&#x27;s who. 


Thanks to the sequel&#x27;s new Ultrahand ability, which allows Link to pick up, move, and rotate objects (including Koroks), many players out there have taken to fusing these poor blighters to homemade crucifixes, rockets and even spit roasting the innocent spirits.

In an interview with Game Informer, Aonuma was asked if the open world design would be the foundation for the next several games, just as Ocarina of Time previously established the 3D format.


Aonuma agreed Ocarina of Time did create a format but it was ultimately restrictive for the designers, while Breath of the Wild offered a new type of play.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the biggest boxed video game launch of the year so far in the UK.

According to our sister site GamesIndustry.biz, that makes it the series&#x27; biggest ever launch week in the UK, surpassing the launches of even early games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time which were only available physically at the time. 

According to GI and the GfK charts, Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s instant pole position pushes Hogwarts Legacy from its top spot, and moves Star Wars Jedi: Survivor into third place.

                              <span>Metacritic has finally opened The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom open to user reviews, and over three hundred players have left mixed or negative feedback.

Although The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now the highest-rated game of the year thus far on Metacritic - and the highest-rated game of all time on OpenCritic – and industry analysts are opining that Nintendo&#x27;s all-new adventure will impact the charts not just for the next few months, but &quot;years&quot;, some fans are making their disappointment more than clear, and whilst the critic score sits at a lofty 96, the user score aggregated from over 1600 reviewers is 8.5.

Yes, admittedly, some people are devastated that you cannot pet the dog, but that doesn&#x27;t account for the hundreds of reviews that cite the sequel hasn&#x27;t address the purported issues of its predecessor, calls the gameplay &quot;boring&quot;, or reports ongoing performance issues.

                              <span>Micro-Star International—aka MSI—had its UEFI signing key stolen last month.
This raises the possibility that the leaked key could push out updates that would infect a computer’s most nether regions without triggering a warning. To make matters worse, Matrosov said, MSI doesn’t have an automated patching process the way Dell, HP, and many larger hardware makers do. Consequently, MSI doesn’t provide the same kind of key revocation capabilities.

Delivering a signed payload isn’t as easy as all that. “Gaining the kind of control required to compromise a software build system is generally a non-trivial event that requires a great deal of skill and possibly some luck.” But it just got a whole lot easier...</span>

How can Pod start-up be accelerated on nodes in large clusters? This is a common issue that
cluster administrators may face.
This blog post focuses on methods to speed up pod start-up from the kubelet side. It does not
involve the creation time of pods by controller-manager through kube-apiserver, nor does it
include scheduling time for pods or webhooks executed on it.
We have mentioned some important factors here to consider from the kubelet&#x27;s perspective, but
this is not an exhaustive list. As Kubernetes v1.27 is released, this blog highlights
significant changes in v1.27 that aid in speeding up pod start-up.

Developer Soda Den took to social media over the weekend to claim that the game was removed &quot;without [its] knowledge or consent&quot; following &quot;issues&quot; with publisher Crytivo.

&quot;As you may have noticed, the Roots of Pache Steam page is temporarily offline,&quot; the statement begins. &quot;We are sad to report that we have been engaged in a dispute with Crytivo over the rights to Roots of Pacha. We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally. Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorised them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam without our knowledge or consent.

&quot;Definitely hearing the feedback on the Necro nerfs,&quot; he tweeted over the weekend. &quot;I&#x27;m feeling &#x27;em too. Remember, balance is a journey, not a destination - it takes tweaking to get it right.&quot;

&quot;PSA - We&#x27;re in the process of rolling out a server side hotfix buff to Necro skellies,&quot; he added earlier today (thanks, GamesRadar+).

That&#x27;s according to industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who took to Twitter to reflect on Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s legacy both in relation to its predecessor Breath of the Wild, and the charts more generally. 

&quot;Sometimes I wonder if a game can last a few months on the top 20 best-seller charts,&quot; he tweeted ahead of the game&#x27;s release earlier this week.

                              <span>PlayStation-backed Deviation Games has reportedly laid off as many as 90 employees.

That&#x27;s according to VGC &quot;sources&quot; and personal announcements shared on LinkedIn which describe a &quot;difficult situation&quot; that &quot;forced&quot; the layoffs.

&quot;A bunch of my colleagues and friends were laid off from Deviation Games today,&quot; wrote Christopher Berry, while software engineer Kyle Perras added: &quot;my studio recently ran into a difficult situation and was forced to make a number of layoffs which I was a part of&quot;.

                              <span>The world and his dog may be ignoring the sunshine this weekend and shutting themselves away in favour of playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of a Kingdom, but what happens when you can&#x27;t even pet the dog? 

That&#x27;s my clumsy segue into confirming the devastating news that no, you cannot pet the dog in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. And no, fans are not happy about it.

                              <span>Brace yourself, Fortnite fans, but it looks like ranked mode is on the way.

Epic Games stopped short of confirming it outright, of course, but instead dropped a mysterious tweet and a 20-second video teaser that declares that &quot;a new way to grab the Victory Royale is coming&quot;, inviting you to &quot;rise through the ranks&quot;.

The real clue, however, is in that accompanying video; whilst short, it seems to take us through eight different ranks, seemingly starting at bronze and progressing through silver, gold and more until it goes all the way to… I don&#x27;t know, super-duper-platinum or something.

And it&#x27;s not just the fans, either. In a recent interview with Polygon, Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s producer  and director respectively, confirmed that they are also &quot;interested&quot; in the idea, too.

Asked if the recent success of the Mario movie had them excited for the prospect of a Zelda adaptation, Aonuma said: &quot;I have to say, I am interested. For sure.

That&#x27;s according to a recent Bandai Namco investor report (via ResetEra), which confirmed that the publisher has sold 20.5 million units of From Software&#x27;s seminal adventure since it launched back in February 2022.

&quot;Repeat sales of existing titles such as Elden Ring were strong, especially overseas, worldwide sales reaching 20.5 million,&quot; the report said. &quot;New worldwide titles got off to slow starts, but smaller more medium-sized products moved steadily.

                              <span>If it feels like the world and his dog can&#x27;t stop playing, talking, or thinking about The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, you&#x27;re not wrong – and even producers of games on other high-profile games aren&#x27;t immune, either.

As spotted by GamesRadar+, famed Final Fantasy producer Naoki Yoshida started his monthly livestream yesterday with his Tears of the Kingdom-themed Nintendo Switch firmly in his hands.

&quot;Yoshi-P walking into today&#x27;s [Final Fantasy 14 Live Letter from the Producer] show and Murouchi saying &#x27;seems like his heart&#x27;s not in it today…&#x27; because he&#x27;s playing Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. LOL, I&#x27;m crying,&quot; one fan tweeted, providing a helpful translation.

                              <span>EA is dabbling in a spot of democracy by throwing caution to the wind and letting The Sims 4 players decide what they want to see in some upcoming DLC.


Perhaps thankfully (I say this as someone who spends a lot of time on The Sims 4 subreddits), this isn&#x27;t a free-for-all, and voters must operate within some extremely rigid parameters.


EA is specifically canvassing players to decide on the themes of two upcoming Kit packs, one focused around Create-a-Sim fashion and the other around building.

                              <span>Steve Gaynor, the controversial co-founder of Gone Home and Tacoma developer Fullbright, is now going it alone under the Fullbright name following accusations of toxic workplace behaviour in August 2021.


Gaynor made headlines at the time after an exodus of 15 staff at Fullbright was, in part, blamed on his behaviour towards fellow workers. An investigation by Polygon claimed Gaynor was &quot;controlling&quot;, and that staff, particularly women, frequently felt &quot;undermined and demeaned&quot;, disparaged and discredited.


Soon after, Gaynor publicly acknowledged his &quot;leadership style was hurtful to people that worked at Fullbright&quot;, and announced he would be stepping back from the day-to-day development of the studio&#x27;s latest game, Open Roads. A separate statement from Fullbright confirmed Gaynor would also be vacating his role as the studio&#x27;s creative lead and manager.

                              <span>Developer Frictional Games has announced another short delay for its intriguing &quot;unscripted&quot; WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker, but it&#x27;s also releasing a little something to tide fans over between now and its new 6th June arrival date in the form of a demo soon coming to Steam.


Amnesia: The Bunker - the fourth game in the Amnesia series, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and Rebirth - has seen a number of delays this year as Frictional puts the finishing touches to the experience, and the developer has now made the decision to push its release back another two weeks, from 23rd May to 6th June.


In a short statement announcing the news, Frictional attributed the latest delay to &quot;unforeseen certification issues&quot;. The decision, it said, was &quot;crucial to ensure we do not ship the game with these issues&quot;, adding the extra time afforded by the delay will allow it to &quot;rectify the problem and ensure the best possible gameplay experience on release&quot;.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom officially launched today, and the race to speedrun the game as quickly as possible has already begun. 


An eye-catching run from YouTuber gymnast86, posted this morning, shows the game beaten in just 94 minutes. This is an any% speedrun with no assists from amiibo.


What&#x27;s interesting here is nearly half of the run covers the game&#x27;s opening portion without any major shortcuts. Even with knowledge of where to go and how to do it, this takes over 40 minutes.

                              <span>In case you weren&#x27;t aware, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released today. Along with the sequel&#x27;s new-look Hyrule, Link also has a range of new abilities that can help him on his journey to once again rid the kingdom of the many evils that have made their home there. 


One such ability is Ascend, which allows Link to pass through solid objects above him. This is a game changer when it comes to traversal, as Link no longer has to necessarily negotiate the weather and his stamina to make his way up cliffs and the like. Now, he can find some kind of overhang and pop up and through to create seemingly impossible shortcuts. 


However, this useful new ability wasn&#x27;t always going to make it into Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s final release. In fact, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma and game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi revealed it actually started off as a debug cheat function not intended for the game.

The ocean moon of Saturn was cruelly cut from Destiny 2 alongside several other destinations back in 2020, as developer Bungie sought to trim the amount of content it had to keep up to date. It was an unpopular decision, and one it has now ceased.


Some of that content has since been re-added, with Titan looking set to make a reappearance in the upcoming Season of the Deep. Here&#x27;s a quick teaser:

                              <span>My copy of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is currently &quot;out for delivery&quot;, and expected to arrive sometime this afternoon. It is now afternoon, and there&#x27;s still no sign of it. To save myself from twiddling my thumbs while staring mindlessly at the wall, I decided to check out Flappy Souls.

Flappy Souls is a new, free release on Steam. It is marketed as being &quot;a mix of Flappy Bird and Dark Souls&quot;, hence the name. The premise is remarkably simple - you have to fly around as a baseball cap-wearing bird while dodging obstacles. Smattered through these obstacles are souls that you have to collect, and as you progress you level up. And that&#x27;s it. Easy, right? No, not right. This game is HARD! 


Now, before I get too into it, let me ask - are you the kind of person who ducks a little when you go under a low bridge in a car? I am. For some reason, I have it hardwired into my brain that physically ducking will somehow ensure safer passage. Logically, of course, I know it makes absolutely no sense. If my car isn&#x27;t going to fit, me ducking, or breathing in when I pass another vehicle on a slightly narrower stretch of road, isn&#x27;t going to change that. And yet, I still do it.

                              <span>Hot off the heels of his turn as Bowser in the Super Mario Bros. Movie, Jack Black has given his likeness to a host of other video game characters, and the results are everything I could have wanted and more. 


This eclectic menagerie of characters all come from Tenacious D&#x27;s latest music video, for a song aptly named &quot;Video Games&quot;. Animated versions of Black and Kyle Gass begin the promo in a fairly normal way. The duo are in a studio, with Black singing into his mic while Gass strums on his animated guitar. Soon, however, things become chaoticly brilliant.


It starts with Gass getting squashed by God of War&#x27;s Dauði Kaupmaðr, and Black fleeing the scene only to find himself in the middle of Fallout 4 (as one does). The rest of the video then sees the duo becoming Sonic and Tails, Red Dead cowboys and more. As I have said, it is brilliant, as you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>It may be Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launch day, but Nintendo is already thinking about the future - and the possibility of a Legend of Zelda game where Zelda could finally be the star.


Fans have long called for Zelda to take on more of an active role in the series she gives her name to. And more recently, Zelda has indeed been playable in spin-offs such as Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Age of Calamity.


But the main Zelda series has remained steadfast at always casting Link as the hero, and Zelda herself as someone kept largely off-screen. (And that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ll say here, where there shall be no Tears of the Kingdom spoilers.)

The game is pitched as a &quot;fully-fledged sequel&quot; to last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2, with development led by Vanguard maker Sledgehammer Games and support provided by Activision&#x27;s many Call of Duty studios.


Apparently all the modes you&#x27;d expect from a full-blown Call of Duty game are included, such as campaign, multiplayer and zombies (&quot;essentially an Outbreak 2.0&quot; that may or may not be free-to-play). There&#x27;s a new Warzone 2 map planned for later in the year based on the Las Almas map from the Modern Warfare 2 campaign.

The showrunners were making casting preparations for The Last of Us&#x27; second season up until earlier this week, when it was put on hold, Variety reports.


According to sources familiar with the matter, up until this point the casting team had been asking actors to read sides taken &quot;directly&quot; from The Last of Us Part 2, PlayStation&#x27;s 2020 release that the second season will be based on, during auditions, as there are currently no scripts for the show itself.

Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said Switch will remain at its current price point despite entering its seventh year on sale, due to inflation and foreign exchange rates. 


As for the potential of a price rise - as Sony did for PlayStation 5 last summer - Nintendo did not entirely rule it out.

Bloober&#x27;s updated version of Layers of Fear, which was initially announced under the name Layers of Fears, is being co-developed with Anshar Studios. It sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 all rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and reimagined as a single, generations-spanning &quot;psychedelic horror chronicle&quot;.


Both previously released games - which respectively chart the gradual unravellings of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece and a legendary actor making one final movie on a labyrinthine ocean liner - get some striking new visuals in the reboot, alongside new gameplay and expanded plot lines. And there&#x27;s a new framing device tying the whole lot together, focusing on a new lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.

                              <span>Following suggestions in March that CD Projekt&#x27;s The Witcher spin-off Project Sirius had been rebooted from scratch, the studio has confirmed its development is back on track, with &quot;work on defining a new framework&quot; now complete.


Project Sirius - a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio Molasses Flood - was announced last October as part of CD Projekt&#x27;s ambitious studio roadmap, which included a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, a new IP, the next Witcher trilogy, and a remake of the first Witcher game.


However, March brought the news work on Project Sirius had stalled after CD Projekt had re-evaluated the &quot;scope and commercial potential of the original concept&quot;. At the time, the company told investors it was in the process of &quot;formulating a new framework&quot; for the game that was better &quot;aligned with [its] strategy&quot;.

                              <span>We&#x27;re less than a month away from the start of this year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest &quot;season&quot; and host Geoff Keighley is starting to crank the hype handle, revealing this year&#x27;s event will feature &quot;updates from 40+ partners&quot; including PlayStation and Xbox.


Summer Game Fest officially begins on 8th June with a live showcase promising a mix of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements, but it&#x27;ll continue on well after that, with various other industry events and showcases - including those previously announced by Xbox and Ubisoft - set to fall under the Summer Game Fest banner throughout the season.


That&#x27;s about as much detail as we&#x27;d heard previously, but the official Summer Game Fest Twitter account has now revealed a sizeable list of game companies confirmed to be taking part in some capacity, including big names like PlayStation, Xbox, Capcom, Sega, CD Projekt, Bandai Namco, EA, Epic Games, Netflix, Activision, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros.

                              <span>Asus has announced final details for the Asus ROG Ally, its Steam-Deck-style handheld gaming PC, confirming the device will launch on 13th June priced at £699/$699 USD.


We first caught a glimpse of the ROG Ally on 1st April this year, but Asus was quick to confirm the device was not, in fact, a weirdly elaborate April Fool&#x27;s Day prank, but rather an actual real thing it was planning to release.


A few weeks later, Asus was ready to talk specs, confirming the ROG Ally would include an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor, a seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen, a UHS-2 Micro SD card slot, plus Windows 11 support, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It also promised &quot;up to&quot; 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode and storage of &quot;up to&quot; 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD, although it offered little word on other planned configurations.

                              <span>Goodbye Volcano High, the &quot;hybrid cinematic narrative/rhythm game/coming of age/interactive movie experience&quot; from developer KO_OP has been delayed again, this time by two and a half months to 29th August.


Announced back in 2020, Goodbye Volcano High - which follows the adventures of a group of teen dinosaurs as they learn to live and love in a world teetering on the bring of destruction - was originally expected to launch in 2021, but a narrative reboot and the global pandemic saw KO_OP shift its release into 2023.


Earlier this year, it seemed an end was finally in sight when KO_OP slapped it with a 15th June release date, but the studio has now opted to push the game&#x27;s launch back by another ten weeks &quot;after assessing its production schedule&quot;.

                              <span>Ted Chiang has an excellent essay in the New Yorker: “Will A.I. Become the New McKinsey?”
The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you’ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans­—one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn’t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has...</span>

If you have deployed Kubernetes pods with CPU and/or memory resources
specified, you may have noticed that changing the resource values involves
restarting the pod. This has been a disruptive operation for running
workloads... until now.
In Kubernetes v1.27, we have added a new alpha feature that allows users
to resize CPU/memory resources allocated to pods without restarting the
containers. To facilitate this, the resources field in a pod&#x27;s containers
now allow mutation for cpu and memory resources. They can be changed
simply by patching the running pod spec.
This also means that resources field in the pod spec can no longer be
relied upon as an indicator of the pod&#x27;s actual resources. Monitoring tools
and other such applications must now look at n…</span>

                              <span>Tim Cain, one of the creators of the Fallout series, has &quot;set the record straight&quot; on the true, original purpose of the series&#x27; famous vaults.


In a video posted to his YouTube channel, embedded below, Cain revealed the idea behind the vaults and their various dastardly experiments was to help scientists figure out how humans might survive interstellar travel - an idea he conveived after Fallout 1 came out in 1997.


Deciding there would be &quot;no earth to come back to&quot; in the event of a nuclear war, the head of the Enclave and the US government hatched a plan to build a starship that would take &quot;our best and brightest&quot; to a distant solar system in the hope of colonising a suitable planet.

                              <span>Nintendo has sent out a teasing fan survey, detailing the long-awaited Pikmin 4.


In it, Nintendo asks respondees to rate their knowledge of the Pikmin series so far (fairly strong), their impressions of Pikmin 4&#x27;s recent marketing (it&#x27;s been OK), and what they&#x27;d be keen to hear more about as its 21st July release date nears.


This last part is most interesting to me, as it touches on a few features Nintendo has only hinted at so far. This includes &quot;delving into puzzle-filled caves, and carefully managing your resources until you escape&quot; plus &quot;embarking on night-time missions that feature new and intense gameplay&quot;.

In October - when Google confirmed plans to shutter its cloud gaming service Stadia - developer Tequila Works announced its Stadia-exclusive horror game would go multiplatform, as other Stadia-exclusive games have done this year.


&quot;While playing it safe and a tad predictable, Tequila Works carefully layers on new gimmicks and mechanics as you progress through Gylt, allowing you to organically build on your knowledge and start experimenting,&quot; Vikki wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Gylt review.

                              <span>An image of an unannounced new map for Warzone 2 has popped up online.


The image emerged yesterday on the @BKTOOR4 Twitter account, apparently from a datamine. It didn&#x27;t take long for Activision to haul the tweet offline, but of course the internet noticed.


According to Charlie Intel, this new Resurgence map is called Vondel and is set in The Netherlands, which should make for a welcome palette-cleanser following the sandy Al Mazrah map and the current Ashika Island Resurgence map.

                              <span>Insomniac Games is yet to announce a firm release date for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, but if you are itching for more web-centric content in your life, you can at least now have a read of the game&#x27;s prequel comic.


This comic was announced last week, along with the standalone PlayStation 5 version of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered. After a brief time of being available in US comic book stores, the entire thing is now online for free. 


I have had a read of the comic myself, and it is a nice, pretty condensed, standalone story that should help fill some of the void between now and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&#x27;s eventual debut (don&#x27;t worry, I am not going to spoil anything here). If you are interested in having a read of what Peter Parker and co. have been getting up to ahead of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&#x27;s release, you can check out the online version of the comic here.

                              <span>First-person shooter Mouse has gathered quite the excitement in the last 24 hours, thanks to its... distinct art style and protagonist.


The game will see you play as John Mouston, a private detective sniffing out corruption and rogue rodents. Inspired by rubber hose animation, John Mouston bears some resemblance to Walt Disney&#x27;s beloved Mickey Mouse. Indeed, he has the long snout(is that correct terminology?) with a round nose, the big ears and the white gloves. But he also has a revolver and cigars, so he&#x27;s definitely not Mickey Mouse.


The gameplay we&#x27;ve seen so far gives me Doom vibes, whilst the vending machines remind me a lot of BioShock. I&#x27;d be lying if I said it doesn&#x27;t look fun to play.

While details of the showcase have not been revealed, its announcement perhaps contains some hints as to what we can expect.

                              <span>Bella Ramsey, perhaps best known on this site for playing Ellie in HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation, has briefly hung up her shivs and bricks to take Gran Turismo 7 for a test drive. 


Ramsey, who has previously spoken about her repeated attempts to get a driving licence, is now promoting Sony&#x27;s racing sim on the PSVR2. &quot;I am about to take my fifth driving test,&quot; the actor begins, before admitting she is a bit nervous about the whole ordeal. It should all be ok, right? Because, after all, Ramsey has a nice PSVR2 set and Gran Turismo 7, so she&#x27;ll get plenty of practice.


Cut to Ramsey tearing her way round Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s race tracks in her new VR wheels, with an appropriate amount of whooping and mock road rage. But alas, these new found tactics and moves do not work in the real world, and Ramsey does not pass her driving test. &quot;You were doing 80 in a 30,&quot; her driving instructor explains. It&#x27;s a really fun advert, so do check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>Blizzard has revealed its plan for Diablo 4 post-launch, detailing its approach to seasons, battle passes and the shop.


In a post on Blizzard.com, the developer said Diablo 4 will get a new season each quarter, and each will add questlines, battle passes, new legendary items, class balance changes and other tweaks.


Season 1 begins in mid to late July (Diablo 4 launches early June). To access it you have to complete the campaign.

                              <span>NetherRealm Studios has released yet another video teasing the next entry in its long-running Mortal Kombat series - and there&#x27;s mounting speculation it could be hinting at a reboot.


NetherRealm shared a first teaser at the start of this month, appended to a video celebrating Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30th anniversary. It showed sands steadily trickling through an hourglass before a sudden camera zoom focused in on the very last grain, which then exploded.


It&#x27;s now been four years since the launch of Mortal Kombat 11, and news-starved fans immediately began speculating NetherRealm&#x27;s mysterious video was in some way teasing an imminent reveal for Mortal Kombat 12 - with one theory suggesting Kronika&#x27;s time-and-space-altering hourglass, which featured prominently in the previous game, may have gone awry, somehow resetting the universe.

                              <span>Dordogne, developer Un Je Ne Sais Quoi&#x27;s gorgeously presented narrative adventure about long-forgotten childhood summers, finally has a release date and is coming to PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 on 13th June.


First revealed back in 2020, Dordogne casts players as 32-year-old Mimi who, at the start of the game, returns to the home of her recently deceased grandmother in the titular French province, where she begins to reflect on the summers of her youth.


From there, the adventure splits across two timelines; in one, present-day Mimi explores her grandmother&#x27;s home, rifling through souvenirs and solving puzzles, while ten-year-old Mimi faces her own challenges, from forest walks and climbing to kayaking and cave explorations.

In Kubernetes, a Service can be used to provide a unified traffic endpoint for
applications running on a set of Pods. Clients can use the virtual IP address (or VIP) provided
by the Service for access, and Kubernetes provides load balancing for traffic accessing
different back-end Pods, but a ClusterIP type of Service is limited to providing access to
nodes within the cluster, while traffic from outside the cluster cannot be routed.
One way to solve this problem is to use a type: NodePort Service, which sets up a mapping
to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, thus redirecting traffic from the
outside to the inside of the cluster.
How Kubernetes allocates node ports to Services?
When a type: NodePort Service is created, its corresponding port(s) are al…</span>

Here in the UK, Ubisoft operates a Customer Relation Centre (CRC) in Newscastle. In the US, it runs a similar team based in Cary, North Carolina. 


One developer writing on Twitter said they had been &quot;laid off today with no notice&quot; and were now desperately seeking work.

                              <span>Good, great, so if you clicked on this article, I&#x27;m going to assume you&#x27;re not fussed about spoilers and that we can now continue unimpeded, no longer having to wiggle around the issue at hand. Dungeons! Mitherflipping dungeons are returning in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom!


More specifically - according to Nintendo&#x27;s Hidemaro Fujibayashi, speaking in a new Ask the Developer interview - &quot;huge&quot;, &quot;traditional&quot; dungeons are making their return to the Legend of Zelda series in Tears of the Kingdom after their conspicuous absence in Breath of the Wild.


Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s predecessor saw Nintendo shake up the traditional Zelda formula in a big way, not just in its sprawling open-world, but by replacing lengthy, elaborate dungeons - which have been part of the Zelda series since its inception in 1986 - with micro-dungeon-like Shrines and more expansive, although largely forgettable, Divine Beasts.

I didn&#x27;t know this (I&#x27;m on the Inquisition&#x27;s blacklist, apprently). I just realised this afternoon while watching the latest gameplay trailer for Auroch Digital&#x27;s upcoming boomer shooter - aka old-school Doom in a Warhammer 40,000 skin.


Near the end of the video, below, we hear the player character, an Ultramarine Sternguard Veteran hell bent on ripping the forces of Chaos to shreds, declare through his vox: &quot;I will finish the work Captain Titus started.&quot;

                              <span>The European Commission - the EU&#x27;s antitrust regulator - is reportedly set to approve Microsoft&#x27;s proposed Activision Blizzard deal.


According to Reuters, the regulator is set to approve the deal sometime next week. Sources familiar with the matter said 15th May (next Monday) is the likeliest date for this, however the EC&#x27;s own deadline for its decision on Microsoft&#x27;s proposed deal is still set for 22nd May.


The regulator had previously announced a provisional deadline of 25th April for its decision on the potential takeover, but that date shifted to May after Microsoft submitted remedies in its efforts to gain approval from regulatory bodies.

                              <span>Hey again, Tom here. I&#x27;m really excited to announce today that Eurogamer reviews are changing. Here&#x27;s a bit about how, and the thinking behind why.


In short, Eurogamer is moving to a five-star review rating system, beginning this week.  


For years now, I&#x27;ve felt our existing review badges weren&#x27;t working hard enough for us, or for you. We ended up recommending a lot of games, or not giving a badge at all to many others - which meant readers not acquainted with our odd four-point scale had nothing to go on. We rarely used Avoid, because it always felt a bit mean.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem&#x27;s performance mode is now live, which means the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions have a 60fps mode.


The 60fps option scales the resolution down - you can pick the default resolution mode if you want to enjoy the visuals at their best.


Asobo Studio&#x27;s well-received rat-infested sequel also now has enhanced graphics for PC, with a Nintendo Switch cloud version due out next week. Meanwhile, all platforms get several bug fixes.

                              <span>EA has added a rather unique warning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor players who try to bypass its story elements. 


Many out there enjoy the challenge of exploiting games in such a way that will allow them to progress through a story quicker. Speedrunning communities exist to share tricks and glitches that sometimes see entire areas skipped - because someone managed to crouch next to that one specific bit of wall while holding that one specific sword in their left hand (or something like that).


EA is clearly aware of this, and has implemented an in-game message that triggers if a player reaches an area that should be, in theory, unreachable at that point in the game. Should this happen, a warning will pop up on the player&#x27;s screen stating &quot;an unexpected error&quot; has occurred.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a new advert for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and on my first watch through I had my video game news reporter hat on, looking closely at the gameplay moments for fresh clues. 


My efforts didn&#x27;t really bring up much new. I now know that for your Ultrahand-made raft to not topple over in the water, you need to make sure it is balanced by some support logs on either side. But that really is about it in terms of gameplay analysis. 


Then I watched it again, and this time my mind was drawn not to Link gadabouting through the sky, but to the real life, &quot;everyday&quot; man the advert actually focuses on. It is quite clear what (or who) Nintendo is trying to paint a picture of here.

Team Cherry had planned to launch Silksong before July this year. Spokesperson Matthew Griffin last night admitted via Twitter that development was &quot;still continuing&quot; and the team wanted to &quot;take the time to make the game as good as we can&quot;.


Another reason for the delay? Silksong has also now &quot;gotten quite big&quot;, Griffin said.

FIFA 23 has done remarkably well for EA, with financial fourth quarter revenue just for the FIFA franchise up 31 percent year-on-year.

                              <span>EA has announced its latest financial earning, confirming record net bookings of $1.95B for its most recent quarter - and, alas, the news that BioWare&#x27;s highly anticipated Dragon Age: Dreadwolf won&#x27;t be out until at least April next year.


Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which has been in some form of development since at least 2017, has never been given an official release date, but reports last year suggested BioWare was targeting a late 2023 launch for the long-awaited title.


Hopes for a 2023 release among fans remained unabated when, last October, the studio confirmed Dreadwolf had reached the alpha stage of development and was playable &quot;to the very end&quot; - but those hopes have now been dashed through omission, via EA&#x27;s newly revealed release schedule for the current financial year.

                              <span>Pokémon developer Game Freak has signed a deal with Private Division, the indie-focused publishing arm of Take-Two, to publish a new &quot;action-adventure IP&quot; codenamed Project Bloom.


Details of the title are limited, but the companies have shared an unexpectedly moody bit of concept art to accompany today&#x27;s news, showcasing a character adorned in something like traditional Japanese garb amid a forest of towering trees.


&quot;We&#x27;re thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work,&quot; Game Freak director Kota Furushima said in a statement. &quot;From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise give us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can&#x27;t wait to share more about in the future.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Ironmace Games has delayed the early access release of its mediaeval extraction looter Dark and Darker as it remains embroiled in a legal dispute with Korean game publisher Nexon over &quot;copyright infringement&quot;.


Dark and Darker received a hugely positive reception when it made a Steam Next Fest appearance earlier this year, but things went quickly awry.


In March, Nexon accused Ironmace of &quot;using materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at Nexon to create Dark and Darker, soon after issuing a cease and desist demand which resulted in the game&#x27;s removal from Steam. This has forced the developer to get creative as it continues to release new playtest builds to players.

                              <span>Bungie&#x27;s winning streak against Destiny 2 cheat sellers continues with the news it&#x27;s now been awarded $6.7m USD in damages following a ruling in its lawsuit against LaviCheats.


Bungie filed its claim against LaviCheats owner Kunal Bansal back in 2021, alongside lawsuits against two other cheat sellers: Elite Tech Boss and VeteranCheats. Elite Boss Tech agreed to settle last July, paying $13.5m in damages, and a court ruled against VeteranCheats earlier this month, ordering it to pay Bungie $12m USD in damages.


That just left the developer&#x27;s case against LaviCheats and (as spotted by TorrentFreak) a federal court in Washington has now issued a default judgment against the India-based Bansal - as requested in a motion filed by Bungie earlier this year - after he failed to appear in court.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has reportedly hired high-profile UK lawyer Lord David Pannick KC - whose client list has included Queen Elizabeth II and Boris Johnson - to help lead its appeal against the Competition and Merger Authority&#x27;s recent ruling against its proposed merger with Microsoft.


The CMA recently made the shock decision to block Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn acquisition of Activision following its months-long investigation, citing concerns over the deal&#x27;s impact on the cloud gaming sector, which it said risked &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;.


In response, Microsoft announced it would be appealing the CMA&#x27;s decision, while Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick told staff the move would &quot;stifle investment, competition, and job creation throughout the UK gaming industry&quot;, insisting &quot;it is far from the final word on this deal&quot;.

The headline says that the FBI “sabotaged” the malware, which seems to be wrong.

                              <span>HBO&#x27;s TV adaptation of The Last of Us may have concluded in March, but the show is clearly still doing the numbers for the network. 


In its recent financial report, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed The Last of Us is now averaging nearly 32 million cross-platform viewers per episode in the States. 


In addition to this, the company stated The Last of Us is the &quot;most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in both Europe and Latin America&quot;. This data is all based on figures from market measurement firm Nielsen, as well as first-party data.

                              <span>Horizon Forbidden West has sold 8.4m copies, Sony has announced.


In a PlayStation Blog post celebrating developer Guerrilla&#x27;s 20th birthday, studio director and studio art and animation director Jan-Bart van Beek confirmed the sales milestone for Sony&#x27;s flagship exclusive was achieved 14 months after it launched in February 2022.


As of 16th April 2023, the Horizon franchise sold more than 32.7m units, van Beek said. Those sales are described as &quot;sold through&quot;, which means genuine sales to customers. &quot;Millions more&quot; have played a Horizon game via PlayStation&#x27;s subscription services and other offers, including PlayStation Plus and Play at Home, Sony&#x27;s 2020 free games offer to help entertain people during Covid lockdowns.

This bundle is available now, and can be scooped up for as little as $10 (the platform says the bundle is valued at over $750, so quite the deal). 


Titles in this bundle include puzzle game A Good Snowman is Hard to Build, roguelike stealth furniture eating simulator Not the Robots and eco-adventure Gibbon: Beyond the Trees (pictured above), to name but a few. Here&#x27;s the link to the whole lot.

That&#x27;s according to Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, who spoke with investors this morning following the company&#x27;s most recent financial results (via Bloomberg). 


The Switch has now passed its hardware sales peak, with console sales down 22 percent over the past 12 months. Nintendo forecasts a further fall over the coming year.

That&#x27;s according to GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s Chris Dring, who revealed Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s digital downloads accounted for almost double the amount Fallen Order managed.


Dring noted that even though Survivor&#x27;s physical sales were down on Fallen Order&#x27;s, overall sales were markedly up from EA&#x27;s 2019 release.

                              <span>Starfield, following in the footsteps of the Fallout games, has cheesy post-sex pillow talk.


Confirmation comes from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which in its Starfield rating summary spilled the beans that Bethesda&#x27;s next game not only lets players have sex, but splutter lines of dialogue after the deed.


This &quot;suggestive material&quot;, as the ESRB puts it, includes moral panic-inducing lines such as &quot;Life is a sexually transmitted disease that&#x27;s a hundred percent fatal&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m all for getting a little wild, but next time let&#x27;s try it without the jetpacks&quot;; and &quot;Talk about seeing stars, whew... that was amazing&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch console sales dropped by almost a quarter over the 12 months ending 31st March, though game sales remain strong. 


Nintendo painted a mixed picture in its latest financial results, with hardware sales now definitively past the console&#x27;s peak as the Switch enters its seventh year of life. 


That said, game sales remain strong - down only slightly on the console&#x27;s last two years in terms of first-party software like Pokémon and Splatoon, and still well up on 2020 and everything before that.

                              <span>After years of anticipation, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s release is now only a few days away. In order to make sure everyone is up to speed on what happened across Hyrule ahead of the sequel&#x27;s debut, Nintendo has released a video recapping Breath of the Wild&#x27;s story.


If you have a spare six-and-a-bit minutes, this video is a nice digestible way to relive the game&#x27;s plot. After all, Breath of the Wild did release six years ago, so a little refresher perhaps wouldn&#x27;t go amiss.  


As you would expect, Nintendo&#x27;s video covers everything from the four champions, some of the various enemies that Ganon has doing his bidding, and Zelda helping Link out in Breath of the Wild&#x27;s final confrontation. But that&#x27;s enough from me. Go and make yourself a quick brew and have a watch of Nintendo&#x27;s Breath of the Wild recap for yourself below.

                              <span>Hi-Fi Rush just got its fourth update, and it&#x27;s clear developer Tango Gameworks is having fun with the patch notes.


While the update is light on improvements, we do have a few standouts, such as &quot;adjusted couch pillow softness in the hideout to better refresh Chai when relaxing in between missions&quot;.


Hi-Fi Rush players will be familiar with Chai&#x27;s couch, on which he can snuggle robot cat 808, have a snooze or have a little chat with himself as he decompresses from the action-packed missions.

                              <span>Following a fairly glitchy release - particularly on PC, with Digital Foundry going so far as to call Star Wars Jedi: Survivor &quot;the worst triple-A PC port of 2023 so far&quot; - and an initial day one update, EA is continuing its efforts to fix Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.


This week sees the arrival of the game&#x27;s fourth patch, which addresses a variety of issues, both platform specific and across all versions of the game. 


With this patch in play, PC users can expect to see updated occlusion behaviour for raytracing, which will reduce idle time stalls. EA has also updated its PC streaming budgets, something the developer says will help alleviate traversal hitching. The team has also implemented general performance improvements for &quot;some VFX&quot; (this update will also be coming &quot;soon&quot; to console versions of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor). Lastly on the PC specific updates (for today, at least), EA has updated the data handling when toggling raytracing, improving non-raytraced performance.

Declarative configuration management with the kubectl apply command is the gold standard approach
to creating or modifying Kubernetes resources. However, one challenge it presents is the deletion
of resources that are no longer needed. In Kubernetes version 1.5, the --prune flag was
introduced to address this issue, allowing kubectl apply to automatically clean up previously
applied resources removed from the current configuration.
Unfortunately, that existing implementation of --prune has design flaws that diminish its
performance and can result in unexpected behaviors. The main issue stems from the lack of explicit
encoding of the previously applied set by the preceding apply operation, necessitating

                              <span>Minimalist traffic management sim Mini Motorways and its subterranean predecessor Mini Metro are getting &quot;one of the series&#x27; biggest updates ever&quot; on 24th July, as part of developer Dinosaur Polo Club&#x27;s tenth &quot;Miniversary&quot; celebrations.


More specifically, Dinosaur Polo Club is marking ten years since the studio first hit upon the idea for Mini Metro during a Ludum Dare Game Jam, creating an early iteration of the game that would go on to make a major splash the following year.


Since then we&#x27;ve seen a successor in 2019&#x27;s majestic Mini Motorways, and Dinosaur Polo Club is now preparing the mother of all crossovers, announcing it&#x27;ll be bringing three Mini Metro maps into Mini Motorways, with three maps also going the other way in its big July update.

Volume group snapshot is introduced as an Alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.27.
This feature introduces a Kubernetes API that allows users to take crash consistent
snapshots for multiple volumes together. It uses a label selector to group multiple
PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting.
This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers.
An overview of volume group snapshots
Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of
multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents “copies” from multiple volumes that
are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate
new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to
a previous state (represented by the snapshots).

According to Axios and a recent court filing, 1548 women have received a payment of between $2500 and $5000 (£1977 - £3950) at Riot, whilst hundreds of Activision employees are also receiving payouts for a separate, but similar, settlement.

                              <span>A trailer for the upcoming Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s movie has leaked online.

Whilst there have been efforts to contain the leak – including a fairly successful community boycott and takedown notices from NBC Universal – the teaser is still available if you&#x27;re prepared to look.

&quot;I got emails about this early in the day but was at an amusement park with my kids and was unable to see what had happened,&quot; series creator Scott Cawthon said in response to a thread added to the Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s subreddit.

                              <span>Bohemia Interactive has revealed that its upcoming sci-fi FPS/RTS hybrid, Silica, is now available as an early access title.

Developed through Bohemia&#x27;s Incubator initiative, Silica is &quot;a crossover of FPS and RTS&quot; where up to three factions battle for control over the planet Baltarus. 

&quot;Lead from above as commander, or experience the action first-hand, either alone, or with friends. Join one of two human armies, or hunt them down as the territorial aliens,&quot; the blurb teases. You can see it in action in the trailer below:

                              <span>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has once again smashed its all-time concurrent PC user peak.

According to SteamDB, CS:GO topped 1.8m concurrent users over the weekend, smashing not only its own simultaneous user record, but cementing itself as one of Steam&#x27;s biggest-ever games.

With 1,818,773 CS:GO players online at once yesterday, that means only PUBG: Battlegrounds now sports a higher concurrent count – no other game ever released on Steam comes close.

                              <span>An asymmetrical horror game that &quot;previously vanished from the market&quot; has returned to sale on Steam after its original developer shut down.

Last Year – which was originally developed by Elastic Games and &quot;amassed a passionate player base and hundreds of thousands of downloads since it first launched as a Discord exclusive in 2018&quot; – has been &quot;reborn&quot; by new developer Undaunted Games and returned to Steam as a free-to-play title.

&quot;We&#x27;ve always believed in the potential of this title,&quot; says Undaunted Games studio head and producer, Matthew Itovitch. &quot;When we did the marketing for the game at PAX East and West in 2018, we saw the reactions from players, and also what this game could be. Last Year definitely deserves another shot at realising that, and bringing back the game is the first step.&quot;

&quot;Slayer proudly takes her place as one of the most powerful warriors,&quot; Amazon Games teases. &quot;Leverage her speciality Bloodlust skill to decimate hordes of demon warriors. Then find your way to Wisdom Isle. You&#x27;ll need the knowledge you&#x27;ve gathered from previous quests to put the pieces together and uncover the path to the final piece of the ark.

The studio states that by using a website that &quot;looks identical&quot; to the real one and using a &quot;very similar domain&quot;, scammers have fooled players into signing up to the bogus site to download a fake beta.

&quot;Mimimi Games is currently being targeted by a phishing campaign,&quot; the studio explains. &quot;Someone is sending out suspicious e-mails with a link to a website that looks identical to the real Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew website and is using a very similar domain, claiming there’s a free Beta download available.

Destiny 2&#x27;s annual Guardian Games month-long event kicked off earlier this week, ushering in a little more &quot;friendly competition&quot; between the three classes, Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks. So it came as quite a surprise when Bungie deployed an in-game message to all players that declared Warlocks had won.

&quot;Warlocks won Guardian Games 2023!&quot; the message stated. &quot;Warlocks win! Warlocks earned the most medallions and won this year&#x27;s Games! Visit the Tower for the Closing Ceremony.&quot;

                              <span>Amnesia: The Bunker, the new &quot;unscripted&quot; WW1 horror from SOMA developer Frictional Games, is almost upon us following a number of delays, and with its 23rd May release date looming, the studio has shared 10 new minutes of gameplay to ponder.


The Bunker, for a bit of context, is the fourth game in Frictional&#x27;s Amnesia series, which began with 2010&#x27;s acclaimed The Dark Descent. Since then we&#x27;ve seen a Chinese-Room-developed successor in 2013&#x27;s A Machine for Pigs, and Frictional returned to the series in 2021 with its ambitious Amnesia: Rebirth, set in the Algerian desert. 


Frictional&#x27;s latest, Amnesia: The Bunker, marks a notable departure for the series, trading traditionally linear tales of horror for &quot;unscripted&quot; scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world as players - in the role of French solider Henri Clément - attempt to flee a relentless, &quot;adaptive&quot; otherworldly creature through the claustrophobic confines of the titular subterranean space.

                              <span>Saturnalia, the acclaimed - and previously Epic Games Store exclusive - survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is making its way to Steam with a first-person mode and other new features later this year.


Saturnalia originally released last October, taking players on a journey through the ancient, ever-shifting town of the title in adventure heavily inspired by Sardinia folklore.


The gist is players - switching between four different characters at will - must explore, avoid the things in the shadows, and solve the mystery of Saturnalia in order to earn their freedom. Only, should all four characters die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

                              <span>PixelOpus, the PlayStation Studios developer behind Concrete Genie, is shutting down.


Based in San Mateo, California, PixelOpus was established with the express purpose of giving young developers a start in the industry, and was formally announced as a new internal Sony studio in 2014. It would go on to release its first game, the striking Entwined, that same year.


While PixelOpus&#x27; initial outing received a mixed critical reception, its follow-up title, Concrete Genie, fared much better in 2019. It was nominated for a BAFTA Artistic Achievement award, and Eurogamer called it a &quot;small, perfectly formed adventure&quot; in our Recommended review.

Destiny 2 first added a battle-pass-style Season Pass as part of its third year of content, back in 2019. Since then, each three-month-long Season Pass has been priced at 1,000 Silver (approximately £9/$10 USD depending on premium currency bundle), making this the first price bump since their introduction.


Bungie&#x27;s newly announced 20% price increase - which won&#x27;t affect the Lightfall standard edition season pass or Lightfall and Annual Pass edition - means each new Season Pass will now cost 1,200 Silver. Additionally, Destiny 2&#x27;s Season Pass + 10 Ranks Bundle will cost 2,200 Silver instead of 2,000.

                              <span>Fortnite has been named as a late addition to the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s latest stab at esports.


Back in March, the IOC announced the Olympic Esports Series, a competition set to feature nine virtual sports, represented by a range of video games such as Just Dance and Gran Turismo. Today brings word that Fortnite will also now be included, as part of a 10th discipline: &quot;sport shooting&quot;. 


The whole thing will also be part of a crossover in Fortnite (because of course), with a specially-designed island in Fortnite designed to promote the Olympics&#x27; Esports event.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we discuss the latest headache for Microsoft - Redfall&#x27;s negative launch reaction -  and the eye-opening comments made by Xbox boss Phil Spencer as he subsequently discussed what went wrong. 

We also look beyond Redfall at the pressure now on Microsoft to deliver with Starfield, following various first-party delays and disappointments over the past few years. As Xbox takes stock of its progress this console generation, big questions remain over how it competes in the years to come - with some potentially gloomy (for Microsoft) answers. 
Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>As the fallout from Redfall&#x27;s release continues, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has raised eyebrows with his claim that Microsoft expected the game to score much better in critics&#x27; reviews. 


During a wide-ranging interview with Kinda Funny, Spencer said Xbox had planned for Redfall to land with an average review score &quot;double digits&quot; higher than the one it actually got.


&quot;We do mock reviews for every game we launch, and this is double digits lower than we thought we would be with this game,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;That&#x27;s one of the disappointing things. We would never strive to launch a game that we thought was going to review in the low-60s. It&#x27;s not part of our goals.&quot;

Space World, which ran until 2001, was essentially a precursor to the digital-only Direct showcases, where Nintendo would reveal its new games and hardware. The 2000 show was infamous for revealing both the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance.


Consolevariations&#x27; Donny Fillerup was recently alerted to a strange prototype GameCube, Kotaku reported, which turned out to be one of the original machines shown at Space World 2000.

                              <span>Dredd and The Boys star Karl Urban is reportedly in-line to play Johnny Cage in Mortal Kombat 2.


According to IGN, the Hollywood movie star is in final negotiations to play the video game movie star in the sequel to 2021&#x27;s popular Mortal Kombat film.


For me, Urban is an odd pick for Johnny Cage. In the Mortal Kombat games Cage is a clean cut, quick-witted action movie star whose vanity is matched only by his star-studded smile. When I think of Karl Urban, I think of all his gruff, beardy roles, such as Judge Dredd in the wonderful Dredd movie, the superhero hating Billy Butcher, and the hairy rider of Rohan, Éomer in The Lord of the Rings. For Cage, I&#x27;m thinking Ryan Gosling&#x27;s Ken or Ryan Reynolds&#x27; Deadpool, without the suit.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has insisted making great games won&#x27;t help Microsoft catch up to Sony and Nintendo in the console race.


Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Series X and S currently lag behind Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch, with sales struggling.


And after the disastrous launch of Redfall - something Spencer has personally apologised for - Microsoft faces increasingly tough questions over Microsoft&#x27;s ability to regularly release high quality triple-A games, and the future growth of subscription service Game Pass.

                              <span>This is just a quick reminder that Sony will be dropping its PlayStation Plus Collection next week. So, this is your last chance to get your hands on some PS4 classics such as Bloodborne, Until Dawn, The Last of Us Remastered and Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End before the collection is disbanded for good. 


The PlayStation Plus Collection was introduced back in 2020 as a curated selection of great PS4 games that PlayStation 5 owners would be able to download and play on their new generation consoles. 


However, on 9th May, the following 19 PS4 games will be removed from PS Plus, as Sony is removing the collection from its service.

                              <span>Upcoming open-world racer Lego 2K Drive will be kept updated with four season passes over the next year, though you can unlock their rewards without time limits. 


Each season pass also has a free and premium track, so you have fresh goals to aim for and cosmetics to unlock whether you pay, or not. And if you start off free, you can always upgrade later to instantly get all premium rewards up to that point.


Season 1 will begin in June, with a second to follow in autumn, a third in winter and a fourth in spring 2024. Each will host 100 levels.

Sea of Thieves&#x27; first Mystery, which ran from May to September last year, was a lovely idea in principle, weaving a web of devious clues - both in and out of the game - that would eventually reveal the culprit behind the murder of prominent character DeMarco Singh.


It certainly had its moments - the magical in-game lantern given to players at the start of the Mystery, revealing clues wherever its light shone in the world, was a lovely bit of clue-hunting paraphernalia - but, unfortunately, the whole thing just ended up lurching awkwardly to its less-than-stellar conclusion, hindered by a clumsy, immersion-shattering insistence on gating progress behind social media engagement targets.

                              <span>For the King 2 - the sequel to IronOak Games&#x27; wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure - is getting a closed beta next week, and registration is now open.


IronOak&#x27;s follow-up - which pits players against the kingdom of Fahrul&#x27;s tyrannical queen 20 years after the end of the first game - is, from what&#x27;s been shown so far, less a bold new direction for the series and more a deepening of the original&#x27;s already hugely entertaining core.


That means another light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure blending familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat story generation through randomised narrative events.

Kubernetes v1.27, released in April 2023, introduced changes to
Memory QoS (alpha) to improve memory management capabilites in Linux nodes.
Support for Memory QoS was initially added in Kubernetes v1.22, and later some
limitations
around the formula for calculating memory.high were identified. These limitations are
addressed in Kubernetes v1.27.
Background
Kubernetes allows you to optionally specify how much of each resources a container needs
in the Pod specification. The most common resources to specify are CPU and Memory.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has personally apologised for the failure of Arkane&#x27;s Redfall, which was widely panned this week.


The triple-A first-party shooter has suffered a disastrous launch, with players and reviewers criticising everything from the blandness of its world to the many bugs, its uninspired looter shooter mechanics to performance issues. It is Arkane&#x27;s worst-reviewed game, and has a &quot;mostly negative&quot; user review rating on Steam.


The failure of Redfall has also brought into question Microsoft&#x27;s ability to launch high-quality games with any regularity after a string of high-profile flops, and has caused some to cancel their Game Pass subscription between now and the upcoming launch of Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield in September.

                              <span>The Competition and Markets Authority is launching an investigation into AI foundation models, following the emergence of AI within several industries. 

AI is very much a topic of concern for the games industry right now. Recent releases, such as High On Life and the upcoming System Shock remake, have both used AI during development and its use has raised eyebrows among players. 
There was a mix of concerns and excitement regarding AI among developers at GDC in March, Chris Tapsell reported. Following the UK government&#x27;s white paper on AI which was published in March, the CMA is now assessing potential effects of the technology on markets and consumers.

On its release, it will boast touch screen controls, but will also support &quot;a wide array of third party gamepads&quot; developer Young Horses says. 
Other than that, news on this upcoming release is fairly barren, but the developer has promised more details (I presume such as a firm release date rather than the broad release window we have now) in the future.

                              <span>Korean studio Npixel has revealed fresh gameplay footage of its forthcoming MMORPG Chrono Odyssey.


The game is being built on Unreal Engine 5 and this second trailer for the game really shows off the power of the engine.


The setting is a western-style fantasy world of magic and dragons, but the pretty graphics are certainly eye-catching. Check out the trailer for yourself below.

F1 23 brings back the series&#x27; story mode, Braking Point, which was first introduced in F1 21 but was absent from F1 22 last year.


Take a look at the trailer below, which includes protagonists Aidan Jackson, Devon Butler, and new kid on the block Callie Mayer (who is also Devon&#x27;s sister), plus some glimpses of two new circuits.

The claim, by third-party app store analytics firm AppMagic, initially reported by MobileGamer.biz, suggested Pokémon Go&#x27;s revenue had taken a big hit last month - to its lowest monthly total since February 2018, over five years ago.


Responding to Eurogamer today, Niantic said the estimate was wrong, and that Pokémon Go&#x27;s 2023 revenue to date was up on the same period in 2022.

The newspaper created a map in CS:GO to distribute &quot;independent journalism&quot;, which launched yesterday on World Press Freedom Day.


The map (pictured), based on a war-torn Slavic city, includes a secret room that shows uncensored footage of the Ukraine invasion in Russian.

                              <span>Former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has seen those Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom leaks and the people boasting about having acquired the game early, and he is not happy about it. In fact, the whole situation has made him embrace his inner Liam Neeson.


In response to one Twitter user sharing an image of their Switch home screen, which had Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lined up and ready to play (presumably obtained by illegitimate means, but I can&#x27;t say for sure), the Nintendo of America alum decided to flex his muscle by quoting from the Neeson-fronted action film Taken.


&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you want. What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you,&quot; Fils-Aimé wrote.

                              <span>Discord has announced changes to usernames, after taking feedback on their format.
At present, usernames are case sensitive and have a four digit identifier, called a discriminator, appended to create a unique username.
The new changes will remove the need for the discriminator, meaning you don&#x27;t have to remember the random number combination when trying to add friends.

                              <span>Nightdive, the studio behind the System Shock remake, recently boasted about using AI to create artwork of its game&#x27;s own evil AI. And, well, things slightly backfired on the developer.


Nightdive used AI software Midjourney to create a picture of Shodan, and then proceeded to share the image on its social media feeds. 


&quot;Look at you, hacker: a pathetic creature of meat and bone. Your body, weak, fragile. How can you challenge a perfect machine? Imagine, how would my immortal body look like? Designed by an immortal machine for an immortal machine,&quot; the studio wrote, with the accompanying picture of System Shock&#x27;s antagonist.

The news comes from a tweet by the country&#x27;s Public Authority for Media, which gives age classifications of video games.


According to the tweet, the game will not be released &quot;due to the publisher&#x27;s unwillingness to make the necessary modifications&quot; (translated by Google).

                              <span>Former BioWare veteran David Gaider has criticised his former studio for its evolving approach to video game narrative, up until his departure from the studio in 2016, amidst the troubled development of multiplayer shooter Anthem.


In a string of posts on Twitter, Gaider said video game writing was &quot;constantly undervalued&quot; - even so at BioWare, which in Gaider&#x27;s words &quot;built its success on a reputation for good stories and characters&quot;.


&quot;[It] slowly turned from a company that vocally valued its writers to one where we were... quietly resented, with a reliance on expensive narrative seen as the &#x27;albatross&#x27; holding the company back,&quot; Gaider wrote.

The conversation this time around will focus on Diablo 4&#x27;s heavy heap of, somewhat contentious, live-service elements, including its seasons model, optional battle pass, and cosmetics.

                              <span>Bungie has secured another legal win against a Destiny 2 cheat-seller, with a court this time ordering the defendant to pay $12m USD in damages.


Bungie filed a lawsuit against Romanian cheat-seller Mihai Claudiu-Florentin - who it claimed was behind Destiny 2 cheating software VeteranCheats - last year, alleging (thanks TheGamePost) copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), and intentional interference with contractual relations.


Bungie had been seeking $11,696,000 in damages, a figure based on the $2,000 Claudiu-Florentin would make from each sale of VeteranCheats across a total of 5,848 downloads. The Washington Western District Court has now granted Bungie&#x27;s request, deeming the studio to have sufficiently proven its claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract, but not of the CPA violation.

                              <span>Unity Software - the company behind the widely used Unity game engine - has announced its third round of layoffs in under 12 months, this time affecting 600 jobs, equating to approximately 8% of its total workforce.


Today&#x27;s job losses were confirmed in a company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with Unity only saying the move would affect &quot;specific teams&quot; as it continues to &quot;position itself for long-term and profitable growth&quot;.


According to the Wall Street Journal (paywalled), this latest round of layoffs will leave Unity with approximately 7,000 employees, and comes ahead of the San Francisco-based company&#x27;s plans to reduce its current global network of offices from 58 to fewer than 30.

                              <span>Earlier this week, the Republican National Committee released a video that it claims was “built entirely with AI imagery.” The content of the ad isn’t especially novel—a dystopian vision of America under a second term with President Joe Biden—but the deliberate emphasis on the technology used to create it stands out: It’s a “Daisy” moment for the 2020s.
We should expect more of this kind of thing. The applications of AI to political advertising have not escaped campaigners, who are already “pressure testing” possible uses for the technology. In the 2024 presidential election campaign, you can bank on the appearance of AI-generated personalized fundraising emails, text messages from chatbots urging you to vote, and maybe even some deepfaked campaign ...</span>

Kubernetes v1.27 graduated to beta a new policy mechanism for
StatefulSets that controls the lifetime of
their PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). The new PVC
retention policy lets users specify if the PVCs generated from the StatefulSet spec template should
be automatically deleted or retrained when the StatefulSet is deleted or replicas in the StatefulSet
are scaled down.
What problem does this solve?
A StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the
Kubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior
before the PVC retention policy was that the control plane never cleaned up the PVCs created for
StatefulSets - this was left up to the cluster administrator, or to some add-on …</span>

                              <span>Pokémon TCG Live, the official free-to-play smartphone and desktop adaptation of the venerable trading card game, finally has a released day, and will be launching on 8th June.


The Pokémon Company announced Pokémon TCG Live all the way back in 2021, with the expectation it would get a soft launch in Canada that same year. Not long after, however, both the mobile soft launch and global open beta for desktop were formally delayed to 2022 to create a &quot;more polished experience&quot;.


With TCG Live&#x27;s current beta period now nearing its end, The Pokémon Company is finally ready to share a launch date, and all versions - that is the iOS and Android app, alongside a desktop release for Mac and Windows - will arrive at 6pm BST/10am PDT on 8th June.

                              <span>Hang onto your spiderwebs, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered will be getting a standalone PlayStation 5 release later this month.


Previously, this remastered version of Spider-Man&#x27;s PS4 outing was reserved for those who decided to splash out on Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition.


Those who already own any of the original PS4 versions of the game will be able to upgrade to the remastered PS5 version for $10. Meanwhile, If you are buying the game for the first time, it will set you back $49.99. There is no word on UK pricing for now, but Eurogamer has asked Sony for clarification. A quick PSA, those PlayStation Plus members who claimed any edition of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man via their subscription are not eligible for the PS5 upgrade.

This new Double Dragon is developed by Secret Base, the studio behind well-received multiplayer horror beat&#x27;em up Streets of Red: Devil&#x27;s Dare Deluxe. It stars Double Dragon&#x27;s famous duo Billy and Jimmy Lee as well as new playable characters in what&#x27;s described as a &quot;modernised celebration&quot; of the beat &#x27;em-up genre.


There&#x27;s co-op (couch co-op for launch, online co-op later this year), 13 playable characters, and pixel art visuals. The trailer is below:

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a bumpy old ride for THQ Nordic&#x27;s Saints Row reboot, but, now, after several months focused on bug fixes and improvements, developer Volition has confirmed the game&#x27;s first bit of paid story DLC, The Heist and The Hazardous, will arrive next Tuesday, 9th May.


The Heist and The Hazardous, which was unveiled as part of Saints Row&#x27;s updated roadmap back in March, is the first of three promised content drops for the open-world crime caper&#x27;s paid Expansion Pass, bringing new story missions, events, cosmetics, and more.


THQ Nordic still hasn&#x27;t shared much in the way of specifics beyond that, but we do now know it&#x27;ll see the Saints embarking on an adventure to exact &quot;sweet revenge&quot; after obnoxious movie star Chris Hardy double-crosses the Boss on a successful assassination hit.

                              <span>Convergence: A League of Legends Story - the time-manipulating parkour platformer (and, yes, League of Legends spin-off) from developer Double Stallion and Riot Games publishing arm Riot Forge - launches for Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 23rd May.


Convergence (or CONV/RGENCE, if you really must) is the third entry in Riot Forge&#x27;s genre-hopping, externally developed A League of Legends Story series, which takes familiar faces from Riot Games&#x27; wildly popular MOBA and deposits them in their own standalone adventures. 


So far, the series has featured a turn-based RPG from developer Airship Syndicate, titled Ruined King: A League of Legends Story, as well as Choice Provisions&#x27; puzzler Hextech Mayhem, and last month&#x27;s action-RPG The Mageseeker, created by Digital Sun. It&#x27;s all change again for Convergence, which shines a spotlight on League of Legends&#x27; dimension-hopping, time-manipualiting Ekko, and brings yet another a new genre focus.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns&#x27; long-delayed PS4 and Xbox One versions will finally launch next Thursday, 11th May - but the previously announced Switch release is now officially cancelled.


Midnight Suns - which blends card-battling turn-based combat and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building into a superb superhero strategy whole - had a bit of a bumpy road to release, getting two delays before it finally launched for PC, Series X/S, and PS5 last December.


At the time of its second delay, 2K made the surprise announcement it was postponing Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Switch indefinitely, only saying those versions would launch at &quot;a later date&quot; - and we&#x27;ve had no further updates until today.

                              <span>Fall Guys is back with a new season of stuff next Wednesday, 10th May, but there&#x27;s a major new addition this time around, with developer Mediatonic having just unveiled a build-it-yourself Creative mode, giving players the tools to construct and share their own levels.


Creative mode functions pretty much as you&#x27;d expect, offering what looks to be an intuitive, fully featured construction toolkit available directly in-game. Mediatonic demoed the new mode in today&#x27;s reveal livestream, explaining that, at launch, players will be able to build Races levels using either Fall Guys&#x27; original or new digital themes - with additional themes, round types, obstacles, and music set to be added in future updates.


After budding builders have selected their round type and theme, Creative mode then whisks them into a new building view, where they can call up a list of available objects, grouped by category, including obstacles, decorations, and more.

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper is being adapted into a tabletop RPG named Cycles of the Eye.


Like the video game, it&#x27;s a solo game broken down into turns called cycles with your energy represented by dice. However, Cycles of the Eye is driven by a tarot deck of cards to represent challenges, resources, characters and more.


Citizen Sleeper was inspired by TTRPGs so this adaptation certainly makes sense.

                              <span>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can now refer a friend to PC Game Pass, and gift them 14 days of free subscription time. 


Invited friends must be new to Game Pass to redeem the trial, and you&#x27;re limited to doing this with five people. Also, to be clear, this is just for the PC portion of Game Pass. 


Still, two weeks&#x27; of free game time is nothing to be sniffed at, and this membership of course includes access to new first-party Xbox games - such as Redfall - and the included access to EA Play and Riot Games libraries.

                              <span>Square Enix has shown our first look at gameplay from Forspoken DLC - In Tanta We Trust.


Releasing on 26th May across PlayStation 5 and PC, it&#x27;s a prequel to the main game as protagonist Frey is launched back in time. 


While gameplay is more of the same, Frey will be joined on her adventure by Tanta Cinta lending her abilities during combat and exploration. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Sony has released the debut trailer for the Gran Turismo movie.


The video, below, gives us a good idea of what to expect from the film, which is directed by District 9&#x27;s Neill Blomkamp and stars the sad cop from Stranger Things and the elf who notices they&#x27;re taking the hobbits to Isengard in Lord of the Rings. 


The Gran Turismo movie is about a Gran Turismo fan who enters a competition to become a professional racer. It&#x27;s based on a true story about Jann Mardenborough, who did just that in real-life.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered what Zelda&#x27;s Adventure would be like on Game Boy? Well, wonder no more, as one intrepid fan has taken one of the series&#x27; least well-received games and turned it into something that actually looks pretty great. 


Admittedly, Zelda&#x27;s Adventure is not exactly canon in the series&#x27; timeline. Developed by Viridis Corporation, it was published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i back in 1996. 


Despite featuring a playable Zelda (in Zelda&#x27;s Adventure, it is Link who has been whisked away by Ganon), the game was pretty poorly received by, well, everyone. Everything from its graphics to its acting came under fire, and even some of the most die hard Zelda fans have generally avoided it.

                              <span>The people behind Skywind have released an impressive new gameplay video.


Skywind is the ambitious mod project that rebuilds Bethesda&#x27;s much-loved 2002 role-playing game The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind in the Skyrim engine.


Work on Skywind has gone on for years now, but this latest video, below, shows the project is coming along nicely. It shows 20 minutes of new footage, including new world spaces, creatures, environment assets, voice lines, item descriptions, user interface improvements and spells, and revolves around a quest from the original game called Necromancer in Mawia.

                              <span>Dredge, the sinister fishing game from Black Salt Games and publisher Team 17, is about to get a lot less sinister (only for those who want it to, of course).


Thanks to an upcoming passive mode, those who simply want to take to the seas and bob around on the beautiful blue without having to worry about the denizens of the deep interrupting their serenity will be able to do just that. In short, when this free update goes live, &quot;monsters that usually attack fishing boats will no longer be aggressive&quot;. 


As well as this new feature, Dredge players can also expect a new photo mode (that comes with a new in-game character) and the addition of map markers in the future.

                              <span>Fortnite has launched a major new Star Wars crossover event timed to coincide with the franchise&#x27;s annual May 4th celebrations. 


The event focuses on the Star Wars saga&#x27;s Prequel trilogy, and features numerous free and paid-for skins to let you play as Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala, Darth Maul and a battalion of Clone Troopers.


This collaboration also sees Fortnite debut a premium mini battle pass for the first time, offering access to some of the above skins as rewards for completing in-game challenges.

                              <span>EA has started releasing the first of its many promised post-launch patches for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. 


Following a fairly glitchy release - particularly on PC - and an initial day one update, EA is now in the process of fixing its game. (Digital Foundry went so far as to call Star Wars Jedi: Survivor  &quot;the worst triple-A PC port of 2023 so far&quot;.)  PC players will likely have already noticed a new patch, while those on consoles can expect to see this wave of fixes going live at some point today (2nd May).


 EA says this particular patch will fix multiple crashes, including those tied to skipping cinematics. It will also address various collision issues within the game, and enemy AI should no longer T-pose when players take a spin with Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s photo mode.

                              <span>NetherRealm has released what looks like the first tease for the upcoming Mortal Kombat 12.


At the end of a video, below, in which Mortal Kombat developers thank fans for their support over the past 30 years, is a brief clip showing what looks like grains of sand falling from an hourglass. One of these grains of sand, perhaps the last, explodes.


What does it mean? As you&#x27;d expect, Mortal Kombat fans are having their say. The consensus is the tease relates to Kronika&#x27;s Hourglass. Kronika, the antagonist of Mortal Kombat 11 and the self-styled Keeper of Time and Architect of History, used the Hourglass to alter time and space, which led to the fun interactions between young and old versions of the same character in Mortal Kombat 11.

The update is available already to Xbox owners in the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead test rings, and will filter out to everyone else in the coming days. 


I have the new version myself, and it&#x27;s a real upgrade. Not only is there more room to see your background, the number of game and app tiles immediately available has also been increased.

The list includes indie action hit My Friend Pedro and cosy tile-based city-builder Before We Leave, as well as popular high school murder adventure series Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair Anniversary Edition. Goodbye despair, indeed.


First-person photography game Umurangi Generation is also getting the chop, so enjoy its retro future while you can.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch blockbuster The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been ripped and uploaded to the internet, with pirated copies now passed around, and extensive sections of footage streamed and uploaded.


Yesterday, Twitch and Discord streams showing footage of the game were available to view, two weeks ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch date, before eventually being pulled offline.


It&#x27;s unclar where the leak originated, or how many copies have been made available. But while a small number of physical copies appearing in the wild may be a headache for Nintendo, the fact the game has been pirated to share and play on PC is much more of a nightmare.

                              <span>NIST has release a draft of Special Publication1800-38A: Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography: Preparation for Considering the Implementation and Adoption of Quantum Safe Cryptography.” It’s only four pages long, and it doesn’t have a lot of detail—more “volumes” are coming, with more information—but it’s well worth reading.
We are going to need to migrate to quantum-resistant public-key algorithms, and the sooner we implement key agility the easier it will be to do so.

Kubernetes 1.20 introduced the ContainerResource type metric
in HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA).
In Kubernetes 1.27, this feature moves to beta and the corresponding feature gate (HPAContainerMetrics) gets enabled by default.
What is the ContainerResource type metric
The ContainerResource type metric allows us to configure the autoscaling based on resource usage of individual containers.
In the following example, the HPA controller scales the target
so that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is around 60%.
(See the algorithm details
to know how the desired replica number is calculated exactly)
type: ContainerResource
containerResource:
 name: cpu
 container: application
 target:
 type: Utilization

                              <span>Apex Legends: Arsenal, the 17th season of the ever popular battle royale, will land on Tuesday, 9th May. Alongside map changes, a new mastery system, and evac towers, we&#x27;re being treated to a brand new Legend to kick this season off with a bang.
August &quot;Ballistic&quot; Brinkman is a veteran of the Thunderdome Games, the predecessor to the Apex Games we know today.  After a tragedy, Ballistic retired and disappeared from public view. Until now, that is, with Ballistic back and ready to show the younger generation of Legends just how it&#x27;s done.
Ballistic&#x27;s abilities are well suited to both ranged and close quarters combat in any mode you choose to play. However, he truly shines at singling out a target and taking them out in a stylish manner. His passive &#x27;The Sling&#x27; allows him to carry a third weapon but only with its base statistics. This means no attachments or upgrades, if you put a purple tier weapon in, it will instantly become its base tier. His tactical &#x27;Whistler&#x27; can overheat enemy weapons, and his ultimate &#x27;Tempest&#x27; buffs not only him but his entire team with infinite ammunition for a period of time.

The main event gets underway at 6pm in the UK/10am PT on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and, inevitably, Horizon Worlds, but Meta is also holding a pre-show starting 15 minutes earlier that, it says, will feature &quot;game updates and debut trailers&quot;.


Once the pre-amble is out the way, Oculus Studios executive producer Ruth Bram will take the stage to present Meta Quest&#x27;s big announcements, and that&#x27;ll be followed by a post-show developer roundtable, promising a &quot;deep-dive conversation around some upcoming games&quot;.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor players have encountered another irritating bug – and this one steals your XP.

Many of you may have already come across the enemy Mogu, a big space troll thing that packs a punch. Trouble is, it turns out that the troll hits so hard, in some cases it smashes your XP clean off – or into – the map so that you can&#x27;t recover it.  

In a reddit post entitled &quot;don&#x27;t die to this troll, he eats your XP&quot;, u/slaymaker1907 reports that there &quot;seems to be a bug where if you die to this very particular troll, you can&#x27;t get your XP back&quot;.

Wudijo captured their first impressions when they recorded the unboxing – which was delivered in a box clearly marked &quot;do not ship before 1 June 2023&quot; – and shared it on their YouTube channel.

                              <span>PC Call of Duty players have set up a petition in a bid to convince Activision and Infinity Ward to &quot;resolve the issues introduced by season three&quot;.

Issues first began to pop up shortly after the update was rolled out, and despite tweets and messages from developer Infinity Ward assuring players that it was &quot;investigating&quot;, the problems still persist for some.

The issue has primarily been affecting players with AMD Vega GPUs and other Vega hardware, resulting in almost immediate crashes for PC players trying to access either Modern Warfare 2 or Warzone 2.0.

The team says that &quot;the Lumen, Ray Tracing, and Niagara effects&quot; help &quot;create visuals and effects that are beyond words and feel lifelike&quot;.

The new trailer follows an 11-minute video that dropped last month which also showed off the gameplay changes and new visuals.

We already knew the Super Mario Bros. Movie was doing alright for itself, and that it&#x27;s now officially the highest grossing film of 2023 so far and the biggest video game adaptation of all time, but if it does hit that milestone later today, it will only be the 10th animated movie to do so.

That&#x27;s according to The Hollywood Reporter, which says the North American projected weekend gross for the movie is $37.5 million for a domestic tally of $487.5 million through Sunday.

                              <span>A Star Wars Jedi: Survivor player is warning others of a &quot;major game-breaking bug&quot; that can prevent progress.

If you pass a certain point early in the game – usually within the first two to three hours, although this depends upon how quickly you&#x27;re trying to get through the story, of course – and die before you save, you risk respawning into a trapped location, effectively blocking your progress.

Like the OP, it&#x27;s not possible to warn you of the issue without at least spoiling a couple of non-story things, so proceed with caution if you&#x27;re anxious to play without any spoilers whatsoever.

&quot;It has come to our attention that some users have been accessing the Street Fighter 6 Closed Beta Test (CBT) software and playing the game outside of the designated period,&quot; the statement begins.

                              <span>US ratings board ESRB has revealed a new Tomb Raider collection is on the way to Switch.

Whilst the games included in the collection have not been named, it&#x27;s likely they are spin-offs Guardian of Light and Temple of Osiris, as the Switch port for those titles was quietly delayed at the end of last year.

&quot;This is a collection of two action-adventure games in which players help Lara Croft and her allies search for artifacts to stop ancient gods from destroying the world,&quot; the rating&#x27;s description explains, again without specifically confirming what the two games are called.

In an interview Barron&#x27;s and spotted by PC Gamer, Zampella acknowledged that whilst the studio didn&#x27;t have &quot;exact dedicated plans&quot; and was not &quot;working on anything currently&quot; connected to a new Titanfall game, &quot;it&#x27;s such a beloved franchise for the gams and also for [Respawn developers]&quot;.

&quot;I hate to say yes, then people latch onto that, and then skewer you when it doesn&#x27;t come,&quot; Zampella said. &quot;But I would love to see it happen is the real answer.

                              <span>As Star Wars Jedi: Survivor continues to rack up negative reviews on Steam for its PC performance issues, EA has released a statement to purchasers saying it&#x27;s &quot;aware [the game] isn&#x27;t performing to our standards&quot; and insisting it&#x27;s &quot;committed to fixing these issues&quot;.


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor recieved a favourable critical reception earlier this week - Eurogamer called it &quot;really fun&quot; despite a &quot;lack of focus&quot; - but reports of serious PC performance problems soon emerged following today&#x27;s launch. Currently, the game has a &quot;mostly negative&quot; rating on Steam, with users highlighting poor frame rates, crashes, and more.


Prior to launch, EA had already promised players it would be deploying patches over the next few weeks to fix bugs, improve performance, and expand on accessibility features - hardly an encouraging start for customers expected to pay up to £70 for the game - but now the publisher has addressed Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s reported PC flaws in more direct terms.

More accurately, today&#x27;s first look is being described as an &quot;official teaser&quot;, which probably does a better job of managing your expectations. It&#x27;s short on action - and pretty much anything at all you might think of when you hear the words &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; - but it does introduce Anthony Mackie in his starring role.


Mackie, you might recall, plays a &quot;motor-mouthed outsider&quot; who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life, as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland. We don&#x27;t get to see much of that in today&#x27;s teaser, but there is a vaguely amusing musical bait-and-switch, a bit of aerial footage, and thankfully - given the video game series&#x27; vehicular combat roots - at least one shot of a car with some guns stuck to the front.

                              <span>Lego has unveiled four Donkey Kong sets heading to its Lego Super Mario range this August.


Today&#x27;s reveal follows the tease earlier this week that Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong, and Funky Kong would all be getting the Lego treatment, with Lego now confirming three of those characters will receive their own sets.


First up is the £57.99/€64.99/$59.99 USD Donkey Kong&#x27;s Tree House Expansion Set, weighing in at 555 pieces. Alongside a Lego DK figure and his iconic homestead, this set features palm trees, a buildable TV, radio, and secret compartment, plus a Cranky Kong figure.

                              <span>A Vampire Survivors animated TV series is in the works.

Deadline reports the indie hit is set for a TV adaptation courtesy of Story Kitchen, which is working with Vampire Survivors creator Luca &quot;Poncle&quot; Galante.


In Vampire Survivors you move a pixelly character around a simple top-downish environment that steadily fills with enemies. Your character attacks automatically so you just wander around, avoiding directly connecting with enemies while putting them within damage range. Enemies drop experience orbs when they die for you to collect, and when you level up you get to spend your experience on a random choice of new attacks or perks or buffs.

Australian twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou are in final negotiations to direct the live-action adaptation of the famous fighting game franchise, according to Hollywood Reporter.


We don&#x27;t know anything about the movie yet, although Hollywood Reporter speculates that if the up-and-coming Philippous are being hired off the back of Talk to Me (trailer below), &quot;tension and gore may be on the agenda.&quot; Perhaps we&#x27;ll see Ryu split Sagat&#x27;s chest open with a Dragon Punch?

It&#x27;s a question Xbox boss Phil Spencer reportedly answered to staff at an all-hands meeting on Thursday, according to Bloomberg (paywall).


According to Bloomberg, Spencer stressed Microsoft remains committed to getting the deal over the line while acknowledging the damaging impact of this week&#x27;s events. The company, alongside Activision Blizzard, plans to appeal.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor released today, but so far things are not looking too good for Cal Kestis&#x27; latest outing on PC. 


Over on Steam, the game currently sits with a &quot;mostly negative&quot; reception, with many lamenting its poor performance. At the time of writing, only 34 percent of Steam reviews for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor are positive. 


&quot;Runs like my ass after Taco Bell,&quot; wrote one player, and they are far from alone with this sentiment (although, so far at least, alone with that particular wording).

(A good dream? Absolutely. Though also one where you check everything&#x27;s still on before standing in front of the class.)


Needless to say, everything about this feels a huge honour and oppurtunity. After 13 years here writing puns and making sure everyone puts the accent on Pokémon, there&#x27;s little else other than Eurogamer I care about so deeply.

                              <span>Valve has released a new update for its Steam Client Beta. 


This update adds a swathe of pretty nifty features and improvements, including the ability to pin windows from the overlay, so they appear on top of the game while in-game. This means that, in Valve&#x27;s words, &quot;yes, you can watch movies while you play games if you really want to&quot; (although, I think it really meant this feature to be more for things like guides and notes). 


As for those notes, this update adds a Notes app. The app does pretty much everything you would expect it to. It lets you take down notes about your game, and comes with &quot;rich text formatting, the ability to have multiple notes per game, and can even be used in offline mode&quot;. Your notes will be saved per game, and are then synced to other PCs that you are logged into.

&quot;The most accessible Forza Motorsport ever,&quot; reads a tweet shared by Xbox, including a video of accessibility consultant Brandon Cole using the new assists.


&quot;This is bringing the AAA racing genre to the blind community to the fullest,&quot; said Cole in the video.

                              <span>Honkai: Star Rail, the latest game from Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse, has already been downloaded more than 20m times.


Needless to say, this is an enormously impressive figure considering the game only came out two days ago, even if it is free to download.


The game has broken records by reaching the number one spot on the iOS game download chart in more countries than any game that has come before, as noted by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad.

UK retailer GAME is offering pre-registration for purchasers, with others sure to follow.

That&#x27;s a record high for this specific quarter for sales of any console in history. The equivalent sales of the console last year were 2m units. By further comparison, the PS4&#x27;s biggest Q4 sales were 3m units.


Added to last quarter&#x27;s 7.1m units and it&#x27;s clear that PlayStation 5 sales are very much on an upward trajectory following stock shortages since launch.

Earlier this week, the UK stopped Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn effort to buy Activision in its tracks, prompting a furious response from Smith, who branded the move as &quot;bad for Britain&quot;.


&quot;Those sorts of claims are not borne out by the facts,&quot; a spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said last night (via Reuters).

                              <span>In its ongoing bid to acquire Activision Blizzard - something that saw a major set back earlier this week, after UK regulators dramatically blocked the deal -  Microsoft has announced yet another 10-year commitment. 


This latest deal is with cloud gaming platform Nware. Sharing the news on Twitter, Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote: &quot;Microsoft and European cloud gaming platform Nware have signed a 10-year agreement to stream PC games built by Xbox on its platform, as well as Activision Blizzard titles after the acquisition closes. 


&quot;While it&#x27;s still early for the emerging cloud segment in gaming, this new partnership combined with our other recent commitments will make more popular games available on more cloud game streaming services than they are today.&quot;

                              <span>Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition is readying to reach even further into the series&#x27; past with the announcement of its Return of Rome DLC, a &quot;new form&quot; of the original Age of Empires&#x27; Rise of Rome expansion that&#x27;s coming to PC and consoles on 16th May.


There&#x27;s quite a lot going on in Rise of Rome - which purchasers will need to switch to from the main screen in order to access its new stuff - but the most notable addition for series fans is arguably the return of all 16 civilisations from the original Age of Empires and Rise of Rome.


That means the Assyrians, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Choson, Egyptians, Greeks, Hittites, Macedonians, Minoans, Palmyrans, Persians, Phoenicians, Romans, Shang, Sumerians, and Yamato will all be playable in Rise of Rome, with the Romans being unique in that they&#x27;ll also be available to play in Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition&#x27;s base game.

                              <span>Arkane&#x27;s co-op vampire shooter Redfall is just a week away now, and as the clock ticks down to release, Microsoft has shared a bunch of new info, including a new trailer, details on its accessibility options, and its PC system requirements - the latter being particularly intriguing in light of the recently announced 30fps limit on consoles.


Starting with Redfall&#x27;s accessibility options, these have now been shared as part of a full &quot;settings&quot; breakdown over on Arkane&#x27;s blog. Accessbility options, specifically, include the likes of text-to-speech and speech-to-text support, screen narration, subtitles and closed captioning, font scaling, a colour blindness filter, notification duration settings, and an optional &quot;accessibility reticule&quot; for anyone that would benefit from a permanent fixation point on-screen.


Arkane has also provided an extensive list of more general settings, highlighting things like toggleable head bob and camera shake, optional object highlights, and four difficulty settings - three of which are available when first starting the game. It&#x27;s well worth checking out the full article for the considerably more expanded breakdown.

                              <span>Warner Bros&#x27; co-op action-adventure Gotham Knights has just received another update, this one bringing fixes, accessibility improvements, and a surprise new 15-floor Heroic Assault raid.


Gotham Knights, of course, recieved a lukewarm reception when it launched last October, with particularly stern words being saved for its myriad technical issues. Since then, developer Warner Bros Montreal has been tinkering under the hood to improve the experience - with notable success, as Digital Foundry noted recently - making today&#x27;s update the latest in a long line of patches.


With most of the game&#x27;s glaring technical issues seemingly now resolved, its latest update - which notably features accessibility improvements such as controller remapping, improved screen-reader support, and button press toggles, as detailed in the accompanying patch notes - is less about fixes and more about new content.

                              <span>A little over two years after first details emerged, the Twisted Metal live-action TV series has a US air date, with its premiere now set for 27th July.


This 10 half-hour-long episode adaptation of the primarily PlayStation-exclusive vehicular combat series - which, slightly alarmingly, is now approaching its 30th anniversary - tells the story of a motor-mouthed outsider (played by Anthony Mackie) who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life, as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland.


Sony first touted turning Twisted Metal into a television show back in 2019, but it wasn&#x27;t until 2021 that the wheels officially got in motion. Since then, US subscription service Peacock has placed an order for the action comedy, while Cobra Kai&#x27;s Michael Jonathan Smith has signed up as showrunner and to pen the scripts - which are based on a concept by Zombieland and Deadpool writing duo Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.

                              <span>Point and click puzzle game The Case of the Golden Idol will receive a new expansion next month. 


On 4th May, players will be able to head into the game&#x27;s The Spider of Lanka expansion, in a bid to puzzle out just what exactly is going on across three new scenarios. This expansion will be in a completely new setting. In fact, so new, it is all taking place &quot;thousands of miles from the rainy hills of Blackfield.&quot;


The Spider of Lanka kicks off a year before The Case of the Golden Idol&#x27;s first scenario, and follows the story of Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller as they make their maiden voyage to the Kingdom of Lanka. Here, they will visit... actually, I can&#x27;t tell you that. In the true spirit of The Case of the Golden Idol, that information has been redacted. I can share this trailer with you though, so please do sit back and enjoy.

Kubernetes v1.26 introduced a new, alpha-level feature for
StatefulSets that controls
the ordinal numbering of Pod replicas. As of Kubernetes v1.27, this feature is
now beta. Ordinals can start from arbitrary
non-negative numbers. This blog post will discuss how this feature can be
used.
Background
StatefulSets ordinals provide sequential identities for pod replicas. When using
OrderedReady Pod management
Pods are created from ordinal index 0 up to N-1.
With Kubernetes today, orchestrating a StatefulSet migration across clusters is
challenging. Backup and restore solutions exist, but these require the
application to be scaled down to zero replicas prior to migration. In today&#x27;s
fully connected world, even planned application downtime may not allow you to

They&#x27;re everywhere in the Soulsborne games: loved by Miyazaki and hated by players. We even rated them all.

                              <span>The Competition and Markets Authority has refuted Microsoft&#x27;s claim the Nintendo Switch is capable of running a Call of Duty game similar to those seen on Xbox and PlayStation.


In its 415-page final report detailing its shock decision to block Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover, the UK regulator addressed Microsoft&#x27;s insistence it could get Call of Duty in its current form up and running on Nintendo consoles should the deal be approved.

&quot;COD is currently available on two gaming consoles - Xbox and PlayStation,&quot; reads the CMA&#x27;s report.

                              <span>Sega of America is currently &quot;investigating and considering the options available&quot; to the company, following the news earlier this week that a &quot;supermajority&quot; of its employees were planning to unionise.


As Matt reported on Monday, this union - which calls itself the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega, or AEGIS-CWA for short - aims to secure higher base pay, improved benefits, and a number of other goals.


In response, Sega of America&#x27;s president and COO Ian Curran wrote a letter to all employees, addressing the formation of AEGIS.

However, one of his more recent posts has caused quite a stir from his followers. Earlier today, the Metal Gear creator shared a picture of himself standing beside Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud (there was also a Kojima Productions mascot there).


For a bit of background, Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud is president of the Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS) and the Arab eSports Federation. He is also vice president of the Global Esports Federation.

                              <span>The number of people playing Activision Blizzard games each month has dropped back down to levels previously seen last summer, before a brief boost bestowed by big releases such as Overwatch 2 and Call of Duty in the back half of last year.


Monthly active users for Activision games - primarily its Call of Duty series - fell to 98 million as of the 31st March, down from 111 million at the end of December 2022. 


It&#x27;s a figure roughly equal to that seen at the end of September last year, before the arrival of Modern Warfare 2 and the big 2.0 relaunch of live service Warzone in November.

&quot;It does more than shake our confidence in the future of the opportunity to grow a technology business in Britain than we&#x27;ve ever confronted before.&quot;

Along with a now customary day one patch, the team at EA has additionally stated it will be releasing several more patches for the game in the &quot;weeks ahead&quot;, begging the question - is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor actually ready for launch? 


In a brief update, EA said players can expect patches that will fix bugs, improve the game&#x27;s performance and add more accessibility features in the weeks following Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s launch.


The language used by EA and early reports from some reviewers have left some fans wondering whether the game needed longer before launch, rather than arriving with issues that need to be subsequently ironed out.

However, outside of Japan there&#x27;s simply a bundle with the game, minus the fancy themed hardware.

Ehreth - who also served as campaign designer on Halo 4 and 5 - will be joined by head of operations Pere Torrents, as well as &quot;colleagues with decades of combined experience in the industry&quot; and credits on Halo, Ghost of Tsushima, Red Dead Redemption 2, and The Division.  


Anchor Point, which will have offices in Barcelona and Seattle, is currently hiring &quot;up to 100 people across Europe and North America&quot; - with roles including developers, technical artists, and designers - to work either on-site, remotely, or in a hybrid capacity.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has released a fourth update for its widely lambasted PC port of The Last of Us Part 1, promising &quot;framerate optimisation&quot; and more among its various bug fixes and tweaks.


As you may recall, The Last of Us Part 1 finally launched for PC at the end of March after a 25-day delay designed to ensure it would debut &quot;in the best shape possible.&quot; Unfortunately, the reality of the release didn&#x27;t live up to that promise, and PC purchasers on Steam quickly began reporting a host of technical issues, including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - earning the port a Mostly Negative rating.


Since then, Naughty Dog has released three patches aimed at addressing the PC port&#x27;s various problems, and those fixes have slowly helped nudge The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s Steam rating up to a marginally less disastrous Mixed. And today&#x27;s 1.0.4 update aims to improve matters further, bringing an extensive list of changes focused around &quot;framerate optimisation, graphical and texture fidelity, crash fixes, and more&quot;.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bunch of activity going on around developer Amplitude&#x27;s sprawling historical 4X strategy game Humankind right now, and as part of all that, its newly released Para Bellum Wonder Pack DLC is currently free to claim and keep, but only for a limited time.


The Para Bellum Wonder Pack adds a total of six new cultural wonders, one for each of the game&#x27;s successive eras. The Stables of Pi-Ramesses are available first in Era 1 and are followed by the Colosseum, the Citadel of Alamut, the Hôtel des Invalides, Whilelmshaven Werft, and, as we step into the modern era, the Pentagon.


As you might imagine, each Wonder brings various benefits to the empires that build them, ranging from increased land movement speed and reduced cavalry/land vehicle upkeep for the Stables of Pi-Ramesses through to increased district fortication and bombardment benefits via the Pentagon. A full breakdown of these bonuses can be found in Amplitude&#x27;s announcement.

                              <span>Pokémon Go will hold its first-ever Go Fest event in the UK this summer, with a three-day bonanza centred in London&#x27;s Brockwell Park.


Go Fest 2023 in London will run from Friday 4th to Sunday 6th August, with early bird tickets on sale now (for £27). As with last year&#x27;s Seattle Go Fest, each day will be split with a half-day in the park, and the rest of the day spent exploring the local area - this time, with bonuses available throughout Greater London.


A version based in Osaka, Japan will run over the same dates, while New York has been chosen to host the event&#x27;s USA leg on 18th to 20th August.

                              <span>Stanford and Georgetown have a new report on the security risks of AI—particularly adversarial machine learning—based on a workshop they held on the topic.
Jim Dempsey, one of the workshop organizers, wrote a  blog post on the report:
As a first step, our report recommends the inclusion of AI security concerns within the cybersecurity programs of developers and users. The understanding of how to secure AI systems, we concluded, lags far behind their widespread adoption. Many AI products are deployed without institutions fully understanding the security risks they pose. Organizations building or deploying AI models should incorporate AI concerns into their cybersecurity functions using a risk management framework that addresses security throughout the AI system life cycle. It will be necessary to grapple with the ways in which AI vulnerabilities are different from traditional cybersecurity bugs, but the starting point is to assume that AI security is a subset of cybersecurity and to begin applying vulnerability management practices to AI-based features.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we discuss the fallout from today&#x27;s dramatic decision by the UK to block Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal, and whether an appeal could still turn things around. 

With the UK regulator issuing a stern warning over how it sees the deal impacting competitiveness among cloud gaming companies, it remains to be seen how much more Microsoft could do to reassure the UK without structurally changing the deal. Or does, perhaps, Microsoft say the UK should not have given up on this so easily, by saying a block on the deal was simply the most straightforward option?
So, do we think an appeal could still succeed? And what will it take? Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been seven months since the last instalment of developer Jupiter&#x27;s mighty Picross puzzle series on Switch, meaning there are probably a fair few fans in need of a fresh fix right about now. Luckily, help is on the way, with Picross S9 officially launching tomorrow, 27th April.


This ninth mainline series entry on Switch introduces a grand total of 485 new puzzles, so plenty of fresh deductive, dot-plopping column action to be getting on with. 300 of those are Picross and Mega Picross puzzles, 150 are Clip Picross, 30 are Colour Picross, and the remaining five are Extra puzzles - three of which will require you to link play data from Picross S6, S7, and S8.


Additionally, the local co-op mode introduced in Picross&#x27; previous instalment makes a return in S9, meaning up to four players can work together to solve its new conundrums.

Continuing the push for Donkey Kong seen in Nintendo&#x27;s theme parks (and, rumours suggest, perhaps also next on the big screen) are a range of Lego Super Mario sets featuring the ape and his many pals. 


Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong and Funky Kong all pop up in a quick teaser posted by Lego to Twitter this afternoon. It remains to be seen how many extra sets you&#x27;ll need to buy to collect them all.

                              <span>Trombone Champ developer Holy Wow has added a brand new, incredibly difficult track: Flight of the Bumblebee.


The piece, for you music nerds, was composed by Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov as an interlude for his opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan (composed from 1899-1900). It&#x27;s a notoriously tricky piece full of fast, buzzing melodies.


Thankfully, this latest update to the game also adds in a Practice Mode so players can reduce the speed by up to 50 percent. Phew!

                              <span>Nintendo will attend Gamescom this year, event organisers have announced. It&#x27;ll be the first time Nintendo has shown up at the German mega-show since 2019.


Nintendo&#x27;s appearance at Gamescom suggests it will have something meaningful to show there. But what? The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4 will both have been released by the time Gamescom opens in late August. Could Nintendo have something hardware related to unveil to the world?


With the all-conquering Nintendo Switch in its sixth year of life, it certainly feels about time the Japanese company at least talked about what&#x27;s next.

                              <span>Microsoft has said it will appeal today&#x27;s shock decision by UK regulators to block its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition - but how will this work, and could it still be a success?


Appealing today&#x27;s decision will be a lengthy process for Microsoft, and hamper any chance of the deal being approved globally for months - and that&#x27;s without the separate decisions still due from the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU&#x27;s European Commission, both of which are still scrutinising the deal for themselves.


&quot;According to the Competition Appeal Tribunal site, straightforward cases are aimed to be dealt with within nine months,&quot; games industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told Eurogamer today. &quot;If the appeal is successful it is then returned to the CMA to review. This again will take some time.

In an internal email, published publicly, Kotick stated the result &quot;isn&#x27;t the news we wanted - but it is far from the final word on this deal&quot;.


He also confirmed that the decision will be contested, alongside Microsoft. &quot;We&#x27;re confident in our case because the facts are on our side: this deal is good for competition,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Indie game developer Young Horses has released four of its games for free, each of which is available on Steam right now.  


Young horses is perhaps best known for Bugsnax, a game that tasks players with finding and capturing the eponymous half-bug-half-snack creatures on a mysterious island, and Octodad, which sees players taking on the role of an octopus posing as a human man with a normal, human family (something that is easier said than done!).


You can expect more of the teams&#x27; eclectic flair in this latest offering of new and older games. Young Horses has released IndependANT, Antbassador, Snakedate and Octodad: Student Edition under its &quot;Free Range initiative&quot;. While the developer calls these releases &quot;smaller side projects&quot;, each of them looks like a lot of fun to while away some time.

The decision by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority prevents Microsoft from buying the publisher behind Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, follows earlier concerns it would lead to an unfair impact on archrival PlayStation. 

Instead, today&#x27;s decision stems from the CMA&#x27;s concerns over the deal&#x27;s proposed impact on the cloud gaming sector. In today&#x27;s final report, the CMA said Microsoft&#x27;s ownership of Activision Blizzard risked &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;.

While this may give a strong indication as to whether the merger is approved globally, the US Federal Trade Commision (FTC) still has the hearing for its complaint to stop the merger filed back in December. That&#x27;s set for 2nd August, after Microsoft&#x27;s 18th July merger deadline expires.



As such, Microsoft is planning a swift end to the FTC&#x27;s deal concerns, reports the New York Post.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s gaming revenue fell four percent and Xbox hardware revenue declined 30 percent in the latest financial quarter, the company has reported.


While Microsoft does not report console sales and did not provide an updated number for Game Pass subscribers (it had 25m as of January 2022), it&#x27;s clear the company is struggling to sell Xbox consoles. In fact Xbox console sales have struggled for some time. Xbox Series X and S sales were down during the crucial holiday quarter last year, and it looks like they were down in the quarter ending 31st March this year, too.


The only bright spot for Microsoft was a slight three percent increase in Xbox content and services revenue. The company said this was &quot;driven by better-than-expected monetisation in third-party and first-party content, and growth in Xbox Game Pass&quot;.

Today&#x27;s update expands on each region&#x27;s previous renditions with new aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and digital elevation modelling data, including an updated height field for Hawaii and a version of Honolulu city introducing &quot;dozens&quot; of handmade buildings.

                              <span>It barely seems like yesterday, developer Rusty Lake was wowing us with its wonderfully inventive co-operative puzzler The Past Within, but now the studio is back to announced its next adventure, Undergound Blossom, coming later this year.


To date, Rusty Lake has released 16 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - blending casual point-and-click puzzling and room-escape-style conundrums into a wonderfully sinister, narratively intertwined saga charting the lives of the Vanderboom family.


As with developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s last few titles, the newly announced Underground Blossom ditches the Rusty Lake moniker but is still very much set in its sprawling universe, this time taking players on a journey via the Rusty Lake underground system through the life and memories of Laura Vanderboom - first introducd all the way back in Cube Escape: Seasons.

                              <span>There’s good reason to fear that A.I. systems like ChatGPT and GPT4 will harm democracy. Public debate may be overwhelmed by industrial quantities of autogenerated argument. People might fall down political rabbit holes, taken in by superficially convincing bullshit, or obsessed by folies à deux relationships with machine personalities that don’t really exist.
These risks may be the fallout of a world where businesses deploy poorly tested A.I. systems in a battle for market share, each hoping to establish a monopoly.
But dystopia isn’t the only possible future. A.I. could advance the public good, not private profit, and bolster democracy instead of undermining it. That would require an A.I. not under the control of a large tech monopoly, but rather developed by government and available to all citizens. This public option is within reach if we want it...</span>

                              <span>Obsidian&#x27;s pint-sized garden survival adventure Grounded is back with its big 1.2 update, this time adding the likes of wasps, a construction gnat (exactly what it sounds like), and Steam Deck verification, fixing some previously troublesome issues on Valve&#x27;s handheld.


Starting with Steam Deck verification, 1.2 remedies a range of problems, meaning initial loading and log-in should now function properly, prompts should no longer flicker between gamepad and mouse/keyboard controls, and the virtual keyboard should now correctly appear as needed. Obsidian has also optimised and tuned Grounded&#x27;s default graphics settings on Steam Deck for a more &quot;enjoyable experience&quot;.


Elsewhere, Grounded&#x27;s 1.2 update introduces new foes in the form of wasps, which can be found guarding their mini-hives around the yard or situated in more challenging Wasp Nests, where players can also encounter the new Wasp Queen boss. Defeating Grounded&#x27;s latest enemies will unlock new items to craft, including armour.

                              <span>Sega is readying itself for a summer of maraca-shaking mayhem it moves to bring its classic rhythm-action game Samba de Amigo to Switch - and ahead of its arrival, the publisher has revealed 20 of the 40 tracks it&#x27;ll be shipping with on launch day.


Samba de Amigo: Party Central, as Sega is calling this new Switch version, takes the infectious rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - which sees players following on-screen prompts to furiously shake their maracas in time with the music and in the desired position - but spices things up with a bunch of new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


Sega previously confirmed Party Central would feature 40 tracks at launch, but was a little vague about what they might be beyond a couple of Sonic the Hedgehog tunes. Now, though, it&#x27;s revealed 20 of the licensed tracks players can rhythmically flail to, with artists including Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepson, and Gloria Gaynor, plus some returning song favourites, such as Ricky Martin&#x27;s La Copa de la Vida and La Bamba.

                              <span>Netflix has released its first teaser trailer for the third season of The Witcher, the last to feature Henry Cavill as Geralt.


There&#x27;s a release date too, with the series split into two volumes: the first will arrive on 29th June, the second will follow on 27th July. That&#x27;s a frequent occurrence on Netflix these days, so viewers can binge a few episodes but not the full season in one go.


Here&#x27;s that official teaser trailer:

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence comes out 23rd May for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One and on PC via the Epic Games Store, Dramatic Labs announced.


Star Trek: Resurgence is a Telltale-style narrative game set shortly after the Star Trek: The Next Generation&#x27;s timeline (that&#x27;s the show with Picard, Riker and Troi etc). Here&#x27;s the official blurb:

&quot;A worker uprising threatens the tenuous peace between two alien civilisations, and Starfleet is forced to intervene. Players experience the conflict and larger mystery from two key perspectives. The U.S.S. RESOLUTE&#x27;s First Officer Jara Rydek is part of the diplomatic envoy led by Ambassador Spock that&#x27;s tasked with finding a resolution – and uncovering the ultimate source of this tense situation.

                              <span>After its initial reveal on April 1st this year, Asus is finally ready to shed more light on its ROG Ally handheld gaming PC, which launches on May 11th and will be sold by Currys in the UK. The Steam Deck competitor looks to be a more premium device than Valve&#x27;s offering, with a faster AMD Ryzen Z1 series processor, seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen and Windows 11 - but no price has yet been announced. 
The hardware side of the equation is perhaps the most fascinating, so let&#x27;s begin there. The Ally is powered by a &#x27;custom&#x27; Ryzen Z1 chipset that includes Zen 4 CPU cores and RDNA 3 graphics produced on a 4nm node. (By comparison, current Ryzen 7000 desktop designs use a mixture of 5nm and 6nm processes, which should give the Ally&#x27;s APU an advantage in terms of performance per watt.) We expect to see configurations of the device featuring the Z1 (6C/12T, 22MB cache, 2.8TF 4CU GPU) and Z1 Extreme (8C/16T, 24MB cache, 8.6TF 12CU GPU) processors announced by AMD earlier today, offering increasing levels of horsepower for a higher asking price. 
Speaking of which, the impressive-looking APU is backed with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode, while storage is up to a 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD and UHS-2 Micro SD card expansion - faster than what is available on the Deck, which is limited to PCIe 3.0 storage and UHS-1 Micro SD cards. Wi-Fi 6E is also included, in comparison to WiFi 5 on Steam Deck. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether all SKUs of the Ally come with the full complement of RAM and storage, or whether this will be pared back on the cheaper options.

                              <span>The ongoing feud between Blizzard and NetEase ramped up this week after reports out of China suggested NetEase had filed a lawsuit against the World of Warcraft maker demanding £35m.

Wowhead covered a report from Sina Technology that claimed NetEase has filed a lawsuit in Shanghai against Blizzard seeking ¥300 million in refunds for discontinued games and services to the over one million players it had in the region before servers were shut down in January.


World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm and the StarCraft series became unplayable in China on 24th January, when NetEase&#x27;s licence expired (mobile game Diablo Immortal was unaffected).

                              <span>We are just a mere few weeks away from Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s launch, and in anticipation Nintendo has released a new TV spot.


For those keeping track, this trailer is the finished product from last week&#x27;s leaked footage. Titled &quot;You can do what?!&quot;, the TV spot highlights some of Link&#x27;s new abilities, such as Fuse and Ultrahand. 


We can see Link creating a hovercraft of sorts to coast over the lands of Hyrule. Then, he battles a Flame Gleeok (essentially confirming the theory that we will be facing different varieties of Gleeok enemy in Tears of the Kingdom) with a fused shield and he uses his Ascend ability to pop up through an enemy camp. You can see the trailer for yourself below:

                              <span>Diablo 4 hardcore characters who die in PvP suffer permadeath, Blizzard has signalled.


Blizzard community director Adam Fletcher confirmed the feature in a tweet. It means that if your hardcore character dies in PvP, you will have to make a new character.


Diablo veterans will be familiar with the consequences of death when playing hardcore characters. Indeed, Blizzard has in the past warned Diablo players it is in no way responsible for their hardcore characters, and will not restore them under any circumstances.

Announced at the tail-end of 2021, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is being developed by Sumo Nottingham, sounds pretty par for the course amid the current crop of asymmetrical horror games like Dead by Daylight and Evil Dead: The Game.


It pits a brand-new cast of youthful &quot;victims&quot; against a single, powerful foe - in this case, a killer family member either plucked from or inspired by Tobe Hooper&#x27;s 1974 horror classic.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below.

Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s DLC Burning Shores released last week, with many praising its visuals and smooth gameplay performance. However, one plot point has led to the game being review bombed on Metacritic, where the DLC currently sits with a 3.2 user rating. Previously, Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores saw its user rating drop to as low as 2.7.

                              <span>EA has called on the internet to avoid posting Star Wars Jedi: Survivor spoilers after an apparent leak of the game ahead of its release.


Copies of Respawn&#x27;s upcoming action sequel appeared to get into the hands of people four days before its 28th April release date - and of course story spoilers hit the internet soon after.

&quot;No spoilers!&quot; reads a tweet from the EA Star Wars account.

                              <span>A &quot;supermajority&quot; of employees at Sega of America have announced plans to unionise, with the aim of securing higher base pay, improved benefits, and a number of other goals.


This latest unionisation effort is being organised in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America labour union - which has previously assisted employees at the likes of Activision Blizzard King and ZeniMax Studios - and represents a broad selection of departments and disciplines at Sega&#x27;s  Irvine, California headquarters.


According to Axios, the group - which calls itself the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega, or AEGIS-CWA for short - consists of 144 employees with roles across marketing, localisation, product development, and quality assurance.

                              <span>The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a 2021 ruling on Epic Games&#x27; antitrust lawsuit against Apple, which both parties had appealed.


Epic launched its lawsuit against the iPhone maker in August 2020, following the company&#x27;s decision to revoke Epic&#x27;s Fortnite developer account, blocking the battle royale game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple&#x27;s 30 percent platform fees.


The following year, California&#x27;s Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. However, Gonzalez-Rogers did side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers linking out to alternative payment methods from within apps - a practice known as &quot;anti-steering&quot; - as that would constitute &quot;anti-competitive conduct&quot; under state law.

                              <span>It might have had a bit of a tumultuous development journey - to put it mildly - but Dead Island 2 is off to a flying start, having successfully shifted over 1m copies in its first three days of release.


Dead Island 2 finally launched last Friday, almost nine years after publisher Deep Silver announced it was in development. Since then, it&#x27;s seen no less than three studios at the helm, but, despite that rocky road to release, its final form - which reached the finish line under the stewardship of Dambuster Studios - has clearly captured the public&#x27;s imagination.


In its press release announcing Dead Island 2&#x27;s blast through the 1m sales barrier in just 72 hours, Deep Silver shared a selection of other notable stats. Over the course of those three days since launch, for instance, players have racked up 11m hours of play time, and 28m deaths.

Key Findings
Based on an analysis of samples shared with us by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, we developed indicators that enabled us to identify at least five civil society victims of QuaDream’s spyware and exploits in North America, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Victims include journalists, political opposition figures, and an NGO worker. We are not naming the victims at this time.
We also identify traces of a suspected iOS 14 zero-click exploit used to deploy QuaDream’s spyware. The exploit was deployed as a zero-day against iOS versions 14.4 and 14.4.2, and possibly other versions. The suspected exploit, which we call ...</span>

Since launching the Auto-refreshing Official CVE feed as an alpha
feature in the 1.25 release, we have made significant improvements and updates. We are excited to announce the release of the
beta version of the feed. This blog post will outline the feedback received, the changes made, and talk about how you can help
as we prepare to make this a stable feature in a future Kubernetes Release.
Feedback from end-users
SIG Security received some feedback from end-users:
The JSON CVE Feed did not comply
with the JSON Feed specification as its name would suggest.
The feed could also support RSS
in addition to JSON Feed format.
Some metadata could be added to indicate the freshness of
the feed overall, or specific CVEs. A…</span>

As is now customary, Ballistic - real name August Montgomery Brinkman - gets his grand unveiling in a new episode of Respawn&#x27;s Stories from the Outlands. Here, we meet him taking a lonely stroll through his lavish mansion before settling down for a recap of his Thunderdome career, which ended tragically with the death of his teammate and brother-in-law.


Since then, Ballistic has become a recluse, neglecting his family until they chose to leave. Which is where Respawn&#x27;s cinematic switches back to the present, and when we - and Ballistic - learn his son, Nathaniel, has just qualified for the Apex Games.

Activision and Arcane Wonders released a teaser video, below, that doesn&#x27;t tell us much of anything about &quot;Call of Duty: The Board Game&quot;, but the official blurb helps a bit.

                              <span>It looks like Lego is set to release a Pac-Man arcade machine model this summer. 


Images of the set have been making the rounds online, and while the pictures in question are admittedly very blurry, they appear to show the upper half of a Pac-Man cabinet. Along with the cabinet half itself, there also seem to be Lego models of Pac-Man and two small ghosts. 


While nothing has been officially announced, according to Lego leaker Falconbricks, this set will be released on 1st June and sell for $269.99 (so, around £217). Meanwhile, it is said to have 2651 pieces.

In a recent management update, Guerrilla announced that its studio director and executive producer Angie Smets was set to start a new role at PlayStation Studios, as head of development strategy.


Along with the customary words of appreciation for Smets&#x27; work at the company, Guerrilla also laid out the groundwork for its new look management team.

The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is one of three key regulators around the world still scrutinising Microsoft&#x27;s deal, alongside the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU&#x27;s European Commission. 


A final ruling by the CMA must arrive before the end of its deadline day - this Wednesday, 26th April - and Microsoft has recently had reason to hope its efforts to win over the UK authority will ultimately prove successful.

This patch addresses a number of issues, and can generally be seen as a very good thing. After all, we all want our games to look and play as smooth as possible. 

If you are one of the many trying to speedrun your way through the game, I&#x27;m afraid this may now be a little harder, as this update has &#x27;fixed&#x27; the glitch that allowed players to warp through walls when using the scope in certain areas. This means no more shortcutting your way through doors. Welp!

                              <span>LawBreakers died back in 2018 - but its chief creator now wants it to come back.


LawBreakers was a hero shooter developed by Boss Key Productions, the now defunct studio set up by Cliff &quot;CliffyB&quot; Bleszinski after he left Epic having famously worked on the Unreal Tournament and Gears of War franchises.


Despite a big pre-release push by publisher Nexon, LawBreakers flopped, with its Steam concurrent player count peaking at 7482 in June 2017 when it launched via open beta. Nexon later blamed LawBreakers&#x27; disastrous fortunes on battle royale PUBG, which at the time was just about the biggest game in the world.

                              <span>Ubisoft has said it is unlikely to launch native PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2, as taking &quot;full advantage&quot; of the current console generation would also mean leaving players on PS4 and Xbox One behind.

The Division 2 originally launched back in March 2019, with versions for PS4, Xbox One and PC. Streaming versions for Google Stadia and Amazon Luna launched in 2020, and it is playable now on new consoles via backwards compatibility.

Last week, The Division 2&#x27;s fifth year of content was laid out for fans of Ubisoft&#x27;s ongoing post-pandemic co-op shooter. Speaking to MP1st, the game&#x27;s creative director Yannick Banchereau also discussed whether a ground-up PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version could also release - but it seems unlikely.

Bandai Namco released the gameplay video, below, that shows off Lili&#x27;s look in the upcoming fighting game.

The pampered Monégasque heiress makes the playable character cut complete with a Siamese cat named Salt. In the video, we see Lili square off against rival Asuka, who was confirmed for Tekken 8 a few weeks ago. In her new rage art, Lili counts to three while knocking lumps out of her opponent, before saying adieu with a somersault kick.

                              <span>In an open letter, seven secure messaging apps—including Signal and WhatsApp—point out that the UK’s Online Safety Bill could destroy end-to-end encryption:
As currently drafted, the Bill could break end-to-end encryption,opening the door to routine, general and indiscriminate surveillance of personal messages of friends, family members, employees, executives, journalists, human rights activists and even politicians themselves, which would fundamentally undermine everyone’s ability to communicate securely.
The Bill provides no explicit protection for encryption, and if implemented as written, could empower OFCOM to try to force the proactive scanning of private messages on end-to-end encrypted communication services – nullifying the purpose of end-to-end encryption as a result and compromising the privacy of all users...</span>

Before Kubernetes v1.8 (!), typos, mis-indentations or minor errors in
YAMLs could have catastrophic consequences (e.g. a typo like
forgetting the trailing s in replica: 1000 could cause an outage,
because the value would be ignored and missing, forcing a reset of
replicas back to 1). This was solved back then by fetching the OpenAPI
v2 in kubectl and using it to verify that fields were correct and
present before applying. Unfortunately, at that time, Custom Resource
Definitions didn’t exist, and the code was written under that
assumption. When CRDs were later introduced, the lack of flexibility
in the validation code forced some hard decisions in the way CRDs
exposed their schema, leaving us in a cycle of bad validation causing
bad O…</span>

                              <span>A Resident Evil 4 fan has made a real-life recreation of Leon Kennedy&#x27;s attache case to show how Leon&#x27;s items would &quot;scale in real life&quot;.

The recreation – which takes a screenshot of a late-game Kennedy loadout as its source – is fantastically faithful, including eggs, a &quot;fish&quot;, guns with their attachments, as well as ammo and health items, and suggests that in real life, the case that holds Leon&#x27;s inventory would be prohibtively enormous.

You can check out the fantastic photograph – which was shared on Reddit – right here (thanks, TheGamer):

                              <span>It looks like physical copies of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will require an additional digital download to play.

Whilst there&#x27;s been no formal word from EA about the additional requirement, players who&#x27;ve spotted the physical game out in the wild have reportedly noticed that the boxed copies sport a sticker on the front that says &quot;download required&quot;.

This may not come as a surprise to some given EA recently published the minimum and recommended PC specifications for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which stated that Jedi Survivor takes up 155GB on PC, and discs can only hold so much data, of course.

The initiative – which &quot;instructs loved-ones to both zombie-proof the recently deceased and toast their passing with a blowout in Los Angeles before the city becomes the Hell-A we see in the game&quot; – is an insurance policy to provide &quot;a wake to end all wakes with nearest and dearest raising a Zombie cocktail during a celebratory Californian getaway&quot;.

They include notes and annotations handwritten by Barone that intimate how he expected players to interact with the different characters and items in the game.

&quot;[I] was going through some things and found my old notebook with the original community centre concept,&quot; Barone tweeted, before sharing wonderful sketches taken from his original notebook.

The &quot;all-new&quot; Veiled Collection Event for Apex Legends: Revelry – which goes live on 25th April and runs until 9th May – not only introduces the requisite new cosmetic skin collection, but also a new limited-time team deathmatch mode Unshielded Deadeye, where &quot;Legends wield limited rotating loadouts&quot;. 

As the &quot;unshielded&quot; name suggests, players forego both helmets or shields and race to become the first to clock up 50 kills and &quot;prove themselves a Champion among Legends&quot;.

&quot;There’s been so much happening in the world of Wild Hearts recently,&quot; the team explains. &quot;We deployed a PC crash hotfix and a Claw Blade &amp; Bow Rebalance patch last week. So much to share and we haven’t even gotten to what&#x27;s in today&#x27;s content update!&quot;

&quot;Deathhaze Gloombeak soars into Akikure Canyon, along with a new title and a new talisman skill for those able to reach new heights as a hunter. Serial Hunts – a new kind of Special Quest – have also been added, and could very well be the most arduous challenge Azuma’s hunters have seen to date.&quot;

                              <span>Four more Ubisoft games are slated to join Steam later this year.

Far Cry 6, Riders Republic, Rainbow Six Extraction, and Monopoly Madness are set to come to the Steam store on 11th May, 8th June, 15th June, and 22nd June, respectively, marking the first time these titles will be playable on Steam.

Since 2019, Ubisoft had skipped bringing its game to Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12 per cent revenue cut compared to Valve&#x27;s 30 per cent.

                              <span>The Mortuary Assistant is now available on Nintendo Switch.

The smash-hit indie horror hit – which offers some genuinely unsettling moments in its 10ish hour run time over numerous playthroughs – doesn&#x27;t seem to boast any Switch-specific features, but it does mark the first time the chilling creeper is available outside of Steam.

&quot;Having completed your degree in mortuary sciences, you have taken on an apprenticeship at River Fields Mortuary. Over the past several months you have logged many hours aiding the Mortician in daily tasks along with learning the ins and outs of the embalming process as well as how to properly handle and care for the deceased,&quot; teases the description on the Nintendo Shop.

                              <span>Sons of the Forest roared out the gates when it launched into Steam early access back in February, and 2m+ copies sold later, developer Endnight Games is continuing to improve the experience, this time adding ducks, a lake to put them in, a double log buff for fan-favourite companion Kelvin, and a sad end for a levitating life jacket.


All this comes via Sons of the Forest&#x27;s patch #4, which, while fairly light on radical new features, brings a host of welcome quality of life improvements - including the aforementioned Kelvin buff meaning he can now carry a whopping two logs at once - plus tweaks, and more. 


There&#x27;s some new stuff on the feature front, though, including a new Action Cam used to view Sons of the Forest&#x27;s found footage tapes - the first of which is now in-game - plus new points of interest discovery laptops, and the ability to name save games.

                              <span>Developers Massive Monster&#x27;s entertaining dungeon-crawling management sim Cult of the Lamb is getting a massive free update next Monday, 24th April, introducing a new post-game storylie, &quot;deeper&quot; combat, new building options, and more.


There&#x27;s a lot going on in Relics of the Old Faith, as the update is known, starting with the introduction of Relics and heavy attacks as part of Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s improved combat. It also adds remixed dungeons featuring revamped enemies and bosses, including new versions of the base game&#x27;s four Guardian Bishops as confirmed during Nintendo&#x27;s indie showcase.


Away from the dungeon-crawling side of things, Massive Monster says the game&#x27;s cult management portion will get new followers, plus a range of new buildings - including a kitchen with its own chef for more efficient cooking, a (non-collapsing) shared shelter capable of housing up to three followers, a crypt to keep graveyard sizes under control, plus farm plot signs which followers can plant stuff around for better crop organisation.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced Victoria 3&#x27;s first paid expansion, a new &quot;immersion pack&quot; titled Voice of the People, which launches on 22nd May.


Voice of the People&#x27;s main new feature is introduction of ideological &quot;agitators&quot; from across history, including Victor Hugo and Karl Marx. Agitators are a new kind of character in Victoria 3, capable of rallying pops to support political movements that align with their ideology.


&quot;Agitators will shake up your internal politics, acting independently of their Interest Groups,&quot; Paradox explains in a blog post accompanying its DLC announcement. &quot;Amplifying power from below, Agitators serve an opposite function to Interest Group Petitions which reflect the demands of the political elite. Depending on how your goals align with theirs, Agitators might be a painful thorn in your side or a valuable ally to your political agenda.&quot;

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s Aaron Greenberg has insisted Tango Gameworks&#x27; Hi-Fi Rush was a &quot;break out hit&quot; amid claims the critically acclaimed music adventure &quot;just didn&#x27;t make the money it needed to make&quot;.


The claim Hi-Fi Rush had failed to meet Microsoft&#x27;s financial expectations was made by Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb during his latest Game Mess Decides podcast.

&quot;Based on what I&#x27;ve heard,&quot; Grubb said during a conversation about the game&#x27;s release strategy, &quot;it just straight up didn&#x27;t make the money it needed to make. I mean it got good reviews, the buzz was good, so where do you put the blame for something like that? Is it the price? Was it the shadow drop? Could it have sold more? Or is it Game Pass?&quot;.

                              <span>Darker and Darker&#x27;s lawyer has accused Korean gaming company Nexon of &quot;anti-competitive bully tactics&quot;, in a letter to Steam owner Valve. 


Following positive reception at Steam Next Fest earlier this year, Dark and Darker has experienced a troubled production. In March, developer Ironmace had its office searched, after Nexon alleged the studio created its game with code stolen from Nexon&#x27;s own &quot;P3&quot; project (something several members of Ironmace&#x27;s team had previously worked on). 


Soon after these allegations were made, Nexon issued Ironmace with a cease and desist demand, and Dark and Darker was removed from Steam. Most recently, it came to light that the Dark and Darker developer is being sued by Nexon for &quot;copyright infringement&quot;, with the Korean game publisher demanding a jury trial in America.

                              <span>Microsoft has disabled its function that allowed users to share their game uploads directly to Twitter from the Xbox console and Windows Game Bar.


&quot;You can still share your favourite moments to Twitter via the Xbox app for Android and iOS,&quot; Microsoft assured users last night while sharing this news. 


In a recent update, Microsoft additionally revealed that, starting on 25th April, its &quot;Smart Campaigns with Multi-platform will no longer support Twitter&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard has responded to claims from one of its producers that the company is creating &quot;crisis maps&quot; of what products can be shipped due to the number of employees leaving.


Earlier this week, World of Warcraft producer Adam &quot;Glaxigrav&quot; took to Twitter to voice opinions on how Blizzard is &quot;losing amazing talent because someone in power doesn&#x27;t listen to the game directors who make his products&quot;.


He added: &quot;DE&amp;I [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] also means diversity of thought, especially when it&#x27;s backed by data and financials&quot;.

                              <span>Valve has released a significant update to its MOBA Dota 2, called New Frontiers.


It expands the map and makes meaningful gameplay, matchmaking and user interface changes, among many other things.

While the core objectives of the game are the same, with lanes the same distance from each other and win objectives still in the centre of the map, there&#x27;s 40 percent more terrain, which means there&#x27;s loads of room to gather resources.

                              <span>This a good example of a security feature that can sometimes harm security:
Apple introduced the optional recovery key in 2020 to protect users from online hackers. Users who turn on the recovery key, a unique 28-digit code, must provide it when they want to reset their Apple ID password.
iPhone thieves with your passcode can flip on the recovery key and lock you out. And if you already have the recovery key enabled, they can easily generate a new one, which also locks you out.
Apple’s policy gives users virtually no way back into their accounts without that recovery key. For now, a stolen iPhone could mean devastating personal losses...</span>
