The Cluster API community is happy to announce the implementation of ClusterClass and Managed Topologies, a new feature that will greatly simplify how you can provision, upgrade, and operate multiple Kubernetes clusters in a declarative way.
A little bit of context…
Before getting into the details, let&#x27;s take a step back and look at the history of Cluster API.
The Cluster API project started three years ago, and the first releases focused on extensibility and implementing a declarative API that allows a seamless experience across infrastructure providers. This was a success with many cloud providers: AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, GCP, Metal3, vSphere and still counting.
With extensibility addressed, the focus shifted to features, like automatic control plane …</span>

                    <span>Following this week&#x27;s massive Twitch data breach - in which everything from site source code to streamer payouts were apparently leaked - a new report has accused the company of fostering a culture that values &quot;speed and profit over the safety of its users and security of its data.&quot;
That&#x27;s the claim made by The Verge, whose sources suggest this week&#x27;s data breach &quot;seemed inevitable&quot; based on their time working at Twitch, alleging a company culture &quot;where employees were very concerned about safety but management less so.&quot;

                    <span>California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing has filed an objection to a recent settlement between Activision Blizzard and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming it would cause &quot;irreparable harm&quot; to its ongoing legal proceedings.
The settlement, announced in September, saw Activision Blizzard agreeing to set aside $18m USD for affected employees after an EEOC investigation stemming back to 2018 found staff at the video game publisher had been sexually harassed, discriminated against for becoming pregnant, and had suffered retaliation by the company after complaining about the behaviour.

Starting in autumn, Grand Theft Auto Online will introduce a &quot;cavalcade&quot; of special in-game gear to celebrate GTA 3&#x27;s 20th anniversary - including commemorative clothing and liveries - all set to be made available as part of a series of still-to-be-announced events.

                    <span>Rockstar has finally made its much-rumoured, occasionally leaked Grand Theft Auto Trilogy remaster official and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch later this year.
Word of an updated trilogy release - focussing on remasters of Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas - first surfaced over the summer, but its existence became considerably more tangible after a Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy listing was spotted on the South Korea&#x27;s game rating board website at the end of September.

That&#x27;s a &quot;sold-in&quot; figure - not &quot;sold-through&quot; to customers. But it&#x27;s an impressive milestone for Capcom&#x27;s 2017 horror title, which is credited with rejuvenating the long-running series.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve known for a while that One Punch Man director Chikara Sakurai and producer Yu Suzuki were working together to bring us a Shenmue anime, and now we&#x27;ve got our first look at the Cruncyroll/Adult Swim production in action - and it looks pretty decent!
With an understandable focus on the action of the series rather than its more ponderous moments where star Ryo Hazuki feeds a kitten or goes for a long walk at night across town so he can play Hang-On, it&#x27;s a high energy look at the world of Shenmue as established in the first three games. Indeed, there are several memorable moments such as Ryo&#x27;s encounter with Lan Di as well as his arrival in Hong Kong, as seen at the start of Shenmue 2.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been just under 11 months since Obsidian launched inch-high garden survival adventure Grounded into early access for Xbox and PC, and as its one-year anniversary approaches, the team is readying Hot and Hazy, its &quot;largest update yet&quot;, for a 20th October release.
Since Grounded&#x27;s stellar launch last year - it attracted a million players within two days and 5 million within four months - the team, still relatively small at only 20 people, has continued to expand on its appealingly diminutive premise.

                    <span>Cloudflare announced its own object storage offering last week, snarkily naming it “R2” instead of AWS’ “S3.” Storage is great, but let’s tie it to cloud economics here. We don’t have specifics as to edge case pricing dimensions, but Cloudflare’s blog post goes into some detail about how it works. First, it charges a rate […]

                    <span>This is interesting:
A company that is a critical part of the global telecommunications infrastructure used by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and several others around the world such as Vodafone and China Mobile, quietly disclosed that hackers were inside its systems for years, impacting more than 200 of its clients and potentially millions of cellphone users worldwide.

I’ve never heard of the company.
No details about the hack. It could be nothing. It could be a national intelligence service looking for information.</span>

                    <span>Facebook — along with Instagram and WhatsApp — went down globally today. Basically, someone deleted their BGP records, which made their DNS fall apart.
…at approximately 11:39 a.m. ET today (15:39 UTC), someone at Facebook caused an update to be made to the company’s Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) records. BGP is a mechanism by which Internet service providers of the world share information about which providers are responsible for routing Internet traffic to which specific groups of Internet addresses.
In simpler terms, sometime this morning Facebook took away the map telling the world’s computers how to find its various online properties. As a result, when one types Facebook.com into a web browser, the browser has no idea where to find Facebook.com, and so returns an error page...</span>

Amid the hack, fewer eyes were on the heart monitors — normally tracked on a large screen at the nurses’ station, in addition to inside the delivery room. Attending obstetrician Katelyn Parnell texted the nurse manager that she would have delivered the baby by caesarean section had she seen the monitor readout. “I need u to help me understand why I was not notified.” In another text, Dr. Parnell wrote: “This was preventable.”...</span>

Why Duplicate Data?
It’s convenient to create a copy of your application with a copy of its state for each team.
For example, you might want a separate database copy to test some significant schema changes
or develop other disruptive operations like bulk insert/delete/update...
Duplicating data takes a lot of time. That’s because you need first to download
all the data from a source block storage provider to compute and then send
it back to a storage provider again. There’s a lot of network traffic and CPU/RAM used in this process.
Hardware acceleration by offloading certain expensive operations to dedicated hardware is
always a huge performance boost. It reduces the time required to complete an operation by orders
of magnitude.

                    <span>Everyone says that the next million cloud customers are coming from enterprise IT. It’s the narrative that all of the major cloud platforms have been saying for a while — to the point that I started accepting it uncritically. I even recently wrote about those next million enterprise IT customers. Oof. No! That’s not how […]

Introduction
In Kubernetes, a Node is a representation of a single machine in your cluster. SIG Node owns that very important Node component and supports various subprojects such as Kubelet, Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and more to support how the pods and host resources interact. In this blog, we have summarized our conversation with Elana Hashman (EH) &amp; Sergey Kanzhelev (SK), who walk us through the various aspects of being a part of the SIG and share some insights about how others can get involved.
A summary of our conversation
Could you tell us a little about what SIG Node does?

                    <span>Years ago, I founded a company that built iPhone apps. And those apps needed web services.  Back in 2009, that meant you ordered rack-mounted servers at Dell, carried them into your local data center for colocation, and managed them by hand or through automation tools like Ansible. I vividly remember spending nights restoring crashed servers […]

Last month&#x27;s release of Kubernetes v1.22 introduced a new ReadWriteOncePod access mode for PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.
With this alpha feature, Kubernetes allows you to restrict volume access to a single pod in the cluster.
What are access modes and why are they important?
When using storage, there are different ways to model how that storage is consumed.
For example, a storage system like a network file share can have many users all reading and writing data simultaneously.
In other cases maybe everyone is allowed to read data but not write it.
For highly sensitive data, maybe only one user is allowed to read and write data but nobody else.
In the world of Kubernetes, access modes are the way you can define how durable storage is consumed.
