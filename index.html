                              <span>We&#x27;ve all been there. Racing ahead in first place after some perfect corner drifting and expertly timed green shell throwing, you&#x27;re slammed with a blue shell ahead of the finish line and drop back into last place. Is there anything more infuriating?


No more! A new update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch adds a custom item option and it&#x27;s the best thing to happen to the game. 


Honestly I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s taken Nintendo this long to implement. Yes, items are used to even out the skill levels of racers as well as increase the mayhem, but item customisation was included in Super Smash Bros years ago. Finally Mario Kart gets the same treatment.

                              <span>Sony has solved its long-running supply issues for the PlayStation 5 - in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, anyway. 


The PS5 has proved hard to find ever since it arrived two years ago, with stock problems leading to shortages and scalping. 


PS5 availability has been a global issue, though one Sony now says it has solved in its home country. Speaking at the recent PlayStation Partner Awards event in Japan, company boss Jim Ryan said the console&#x27;s ongoing supply problems had now finally been put to bed.

&quot;The dream is real,&quot; Albl shared last night.

According to the listing, Street Fighter 6 will launch on 2nd June 2023, with a Standard and Deluxe Edition - the latter of which will include the game&#x27;s Year 1 Character Pass.


A third option, for the game&#x27;s Ultimate Edition, replaces the Year 1 Character Pass for the Year 1 Ultimate Pass. We may find out more about all that this evening.

Exact details of the theft are unclear, though it&#x27;s reported the incident took place as stock was being moved between warehouses. Nobody was injured, but all stock was taken.


The £130 gaming handhelds had been destined for despatch to customers in the UK and USA, and elsewhere in the world outside of Europe. A separate consignment bound for customers in mainland Europe is unaffected.

Łukasz Siewierski, a member of Google’s Android Security Team, has a post on the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative (AVPI) issue tracker detailing leaked platform certificate keys that are actively being used to sign malware. The post is just a list of the keys, but running each one through APKMirror or Google’s VirusTotal site will put names to some of the compromised keys: Samsung, LG, and Mediatek are the heavy hitters on the list of leaked keys, along with some smaller OEMs like ...</span>

                              <span>Sony is giving players the opportunity to try out the online multiplayer portion of its PlayStation Plus subscription service for free this weekend, starting on Saturday, 10th December.


That means anyone can put PlayStation 4 and 5&#x27;s online multiplayer through its paces - teaming up with friends, strangers, or other non-specific entities across all multiplayer-supporting games - between 10th-11th December without needing to cough up the usual fee.


The requirements to particpate are fairly obvious: players will need to register a PSN account, will need an active internet connection, and will need access to a game that supports online play. Why not, for instance, give Elden Ring&#x27;s new PvP-focused Colosseum update a try?

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play mobile shooter The Division Resurgence is launching a closed-beta-style &quot;live test&quot; tomorrow, 8th December, for select participants on Android - and there&#x27;s a new trailer to accompany the announcement.


Resurgence (not to be confused with Heartland, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play Division game for PC and consoles), will, like other titles in the series, be an open-world third-person shooter RPG set in post-crisis America - specifically, Manhattan - following a deadly virus outbreak.


Ubisoft&#x27;s previous chatter around Resurgence has promised a fresh story campaign offering a &quot;new perspective on key story events&quot; from past The Division games, with players once again being cast as agents allied to the Strategic Homeland.

                              <span>Legendary game designer Jeff Minter and his Llamasoft outfit is back with another blast of psychedelic shooter action, this time in the form of Akka Arrh - a &quot;reimagining&quot; of an &#x27;80s arcade cabinet game that never actually released.


This, of course, is a somewhat different scenario to Minter&#x27;s Polybius, which was inspired by an &#x27;80s arcade cabinet game that never actually existed. Akka Arrh, though, is very much a thing, having been designed by Atari&#x27;s Mike Hally and Dave Ralston as a prototype back in 1982.


Minter&#x27;s reimagining of Akka Arrh - of which only three cabinets are still said to exist - has been created in partnership with Atari, and promises &quot;a cascade of words, colour, shapes and sound [flowing] around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers&quot;.

                              <span>Delightful VR fantasy adventure Moss and its sequel have been confirmed as PSVR2 launch titles, with both games arriving alongside Sony&#x27;s new hardware on 22nd February next year.


The original Moss, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, initially launched as a PSVR exclusive back in 2018, gaining widespread acclaim for its charming tale of a tiny mouse, Quill, on a journey through a beautiful, human-sized fantasy world. Eurogamer called it &quot;the finest PSVR game to date&quot;.


Its best trick was its hybrid first-person/-third-person perspective, giving players full control over Quill while simultaneously letting them view the action through the eyes of a spirit, able to interact with the environment to solve puzzles and help Quill on her journey.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to the early 90s and you may recall two aliens with a love for funk music crash landing on earth. These aliens were ToeJam and Earl, and their initial crash landing here (all via the Sega Mega Drive) resulted in their names being elevated to somewhat of a cult status in the industry. 


Now, over 30 years since their first landing, ToeJam and Earl will soon be coming to a new medium. Yes, these two aliens will be joining the likes of Lara Croft, Nathan Drake and Mario, who have all made the transition to the big screen. 


Per The Hollywood Reporter, a new feature film from Amazon based on ToeJam and Earl&#x27;s video game escapades will be heading our way sometime in the future. This upcoming project will be written by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, whose previous work includes Hotel Transylvania 4. Meanwhile, basketball player Stephen Curry will also be producing the project through his production company Unanimous Media.

                              <span>No blue shells? ALL BLUE SHELLS? Beautiful, perpetual chaos can now be yours whenever you desire, thanks to a free new Mario Kart 8 Deluxe update enabling players to define exactly which items they want to appear in their games.


As detailed in Nintendo&#x27;s announcement tweet, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s new custom item feature works with offline VS races, as well as &quot;certain&quot; online modes, and gives players the ability to either randomise items that&#x27;ll be available in their races or to toggle specific items on or off. And yes, that means competitions can now be entirely item-free.


That&#x27;s not quite the end of it, either; in Team Races and Battles, it&#x27;s even possible to allocate items to specific teams, meaning you can really pile on the pressure - perhaps all spiny shells against an increasingly sweaty palmed team armed with nothing but hooters?

                              <span>Fans of Sonic the Hedgehog and Genshin Impact are fighting over various claims of foul play in relation to this year&#x27;s Players&#x27; Voice fan vote at tomorrow&#x27;s Game Awards.


The Players&#x27; Voice category is a 100 percent fan-voted award which this year has five possible choices as its finalists: Elden Ring, Genshin Impact, Stray, God of War Ragnarok and Sonic Frontiers. Over the past week, the vote has become mired in controversy amidst accusations of a broken poll, bots and bribery.


To be clear, there&#x27;s no credible evidence of bribery, despite various fan claims foul play must be to blame for both Sonic (with a lower Metacritic score than other entrants) and Genshin Impact (whose detractors point out was first released in 2020) being way-off in the lead.

                              <span>This morning, Xbox head Phil Spencer let the world know Microsoft was planning to sweeten its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal (perhaps specifically with the FTC in mind) by assuring consumers that, should the company&#x27;s proposed acquisition go through, it would commit to putting Call of Duty titles onto Nintendo consoles for 10 years. 


As part of this announcement, Spencer stated &quot;Microsoft is committed to helping bring more games to more people - however they choose to play.&quot;


So, how do people choose to play Call of Duty? Well, for this current generation of consoles at least, not on a Nintendo Switch. There simply just isn&#x27;t the option to do so.

Japanese newspaper Asahi reported today that Naka now stands accused of violating financial laws in relation to another mobile game it is claimed he had insider knowledge of - Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier.


Specifically, Naka is accused of purchasing 144.7m yen&#x27;s worth of shares in its developer ATeam (worth around £865k) before The First Soldier was officially announced.

This week, England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was shown footage of himself lugging a monogrammed computer case to 2022&#x27;s controversial Qatar tournament, as part of an official interview released on the England squad YouTube channel.


Pickford was asked what he was getting up to during his downtime - and, amongst other things, eventually revealed he was still hooked to Fortnite. (And no wonder - its freshly-minted Chapter 4 has reinvented the game.)

A further group of mods will be included as part of the update - now part of the game proper, with their original creators reimbursed and credited.

                              <span>Microsoft has agreed a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo if its buyout of Activision Blizzard goes through.


Xbox boss Phil Spencer tweeted the announcement, which also confirms the company&#x27;s commitment to continue to release Call of Duty games on Valve&#x27;s Steam platform &quot;simultaneously to Xbox&quot;, if the gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard is approved. Call of Duty&#x27;s latest releases, Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, are already on Steam.


The announcement is a direct response to the scrutiny the acquisition has come under from a raft of organisations across the world, chief among them the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK.

                              <span>This is a really interesting paper that discusses what the authors call the Decoupling Principle:
The idea is simple, yet previously not clearly articulated: to ensure privacy, information should be divided architecturally and institutionally such that each entity has only the information they need to perform their relevant function. Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</span>

Those looking to add a bit more visual pizazz to GTA Online on current-gen consoles will have the option to activate real-time ray-traced reflections - which will be applied across &quot;many&quot; surfaces - via the Fidelity Mode graphics setting when the update hits.


Elsewhere in December&#x27;s update, Rockstar is making the retro-styled Declasse Tahoma Coupe available for purchase by all for a limited time in celebration of players collectively amassing four trillion GTA$ in the recent Heists Challenge.

                              <span>Eight years since its initial unveiling and multiple delays later, Dead Island 2 is finally almost upon us - and ahead of its launch next April, publisher Deep Silver has shared more of its open-world, zombie-pulverising antics in a new digital showcase.


Those with itchy fast-forward fingers will be pleased to know the vast majority of Dead Island 2&#x27;s 15-minute showcase is taken up by largely uninformative live-action sequences, featuring a group of zombie apocalypse survivors as they stumble across a copy of Dead Island 2 in a fancy LA mansion. It&#x27;s entirely inessential fluff, but, tucked between all that, Deep Silver does manage to squeeze in a few minutes of gameplay.


Admittedly, there&#x27;s little that&#x27;s particularly revelatory in there - the publisher basically just used the time to reiterate the obvious fact you&#x27;ll mostly be maiming various zombie types gruesomely until they&#x27;re dead - but it did give us a decent new look at Dead Island 2&#x27;s appealingly sun-kissed gore, as well as a taste of its weapon roster, including hammers, machetes, bear claws, a &quot;shit-tonne of guns&quot;, and various makeshift tools of destruction.

                              <span>Halo Infinite has released its December update, bringing with it the earlier-than-anticipated arrival of a custom game browser, an updated version of Halo 3&#x27;s The Pit map, and more.


Halo Infinite&#x27;s new custom game browser is designed to work in tandem with the Forge Beta introduced as part of November&#x27;s Winter Update. It was originally planned for release as part of next year&#x27;s Season 3, but as developer 343 Industries explains in its blog post, &quot;We fully agree with players who felt [it] should be a priority — it&#x27;s a key support structure for what players create in Forge and a pillar for the community.&quot; 343 says this initial V1 release is &quot;likely to have some rough edges&quot; but will continue to evolve over time.


Elsewhere, today&#x27;s update introduces Empyrean, a &quot;reimagining&quot; of Halo 3&#x27;s The Pit map that&#x27;s been officially rebuilt in Forge by 343. &quot;How do Halo Infinite&#x27;s toys, like its limited-use Equipment, alter some of those dynamics and affect how you traverse the combat dance floor?,&quot; the developer asks in its introduction. &quot;Maybe the enemy team managed to grab the rockets first, but you went and acquired the Repulsor to protect yourself... We can&#x27;t wait to see what new memories are forged in this proving ground!

                              <span>Hindsight, the acclaimed narrative adventure from developer Joel MacDonald and publisher Annapurna Interactive - in which players experience a woman&#x27;s entire life, from birth to the present day - is now available on Xbox One and PlayStation. 


Hindsight is the follow-up McDonald&#x27;s acclaimed iOS botanical puzzler Prune (McDonald is also a former Call of Duty designer) and tells the story of a woman revisiting her childhood home following her mother&#x27;s death. As she sorts through her old belongings, she unlocks old memories that players can experience first-hand in the form of dioramas.


&quot;Hindsight asks you to slow down and pay attention to the little things left behind,&quot; explains the game&#x27;s official blurb. &quot;Piece these things together and shift your viewpoint until you find just the right perspective to pull you deeper into the past... Linger as long as you wish, but sooner or later you must come back to the present.&quot;

                              <span>Vampire Survivors, the acclaimed minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is getting its first dollop of paid DLC next week in the form of Legacy of the Moonspell, arriving next Thursday, 15th December, on Xbox and PC.


&quot;In eastern lands, a clan has fallen,&quot; explains Poncle in its DLC announcement post. &quot;The Moonspell, once vigilant guardians of a sorcerous valley nestled in the mountains, have been overrun by hordes of yokai and oni. Though treacherous, this hive of spectral activity may provide some clue as to the location of a vampire. If not, at least it&#x27;ll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process.&quot;


More specifically, Legacy of the Moonspell introduces eight new characters - including Miang Moonspell, Menya Moonspell, Syuuto Moonspell, and Babi-Onna - plus new monsters, six new music tracks, and a &quot;huge&quot; new stage incorporating the likes of an abandoned castle, yokai-infested village, and snow-covered mountain.

All nine companions have their own unique loyalty questlines and of course are fully voiced.

                              <span>Metroid Prime developer Retro Studio once had an idea for an XCOM-style game starring Samus Aran.


The concept, dubbed Metroid Tactics, was the brainchild of Metroid Prime developer Paul Tozer. The idea was one of several pitched following the conclusion of Retro&#x27;s Metroid Prime trilogy - and another which was ultimately turned down. 


Tozer discussed the pitch publicly for the first time this week in a new Did You Know Gaming video which details the game&#x27;s planned setting and storyline as a prequel to the entire Metroid series.

Photo Mode was a highlight of God of War (2018), where it was also released after launch.

                              <span>David Harbour, best known for his role as Jim Hopper in the Netflix series Stranger Things, has revealed that he is starring in an upcoming horror game alongside Killing Eve star Jodie Comer. 


The news was revealed in an interview with Video Games FanNation, which Harbour ostensibly took part in to promote World of Warcraft&#x27;s Dragonflight expansion. 


Harbour is currently working on a movie adaptation of Gran Turismo and was asked on whether he would consider starring in a video game.

                              <span>Epic Games has removed an ultra-rare Snoop Dogg-themed dance emote which reappeared on sale in Fortnite&#x27;s Item Shop shop last night for the first time in more than four years.


The emote, named &quot;Tidy&quot;, allows your character to dance like Snoop Dogg in his 2004 song Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot. It&#x27;s one of a handful of emotes from Fortnite&#x27;s early days thought to use unlicensed dance moves - other examples of which sparked largely-unsuccessful legal threats from individuals keen to take Epic Games to court. 


Fans were surprised to see the emote return upon the Item Shop&#x27;s midnight UK time refresh - though its appearance was shortlived, and it was pulled from sale just a couple of hours later.

                              <span>New leaks have appeared online which reportedly show details for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s Season 2.  


Key art from marketing material show-off a Japanese theme, with artwork teasing the return of the classic map Castle (thanks, WhatIfGaming).   


Castle was originally a multiplayer map in Call of Duty World at War, set in an old Japanese fortress in World War 2. The map most recently made a return in Call of Duty Vanguard, but this would be the first time the map would appear in the franchise&#x27;s modern theme of shooters.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has announced plans to wind down support for Gwent, its Witcher card game spin-off, and laid out how it will hand over future balancing decisions to Gwent&#x27;s community of players.


The game&#x27;s final 72 cards will release next year in three expansions, set to launch in April, July and September 2023. After this time, CD Projekt will transition from its own monthly balance changes to a system voted on by players. 


Dubbed as &quot;Project Gwenfinity&quot;, the idea is that Gwent can be left to just a skeleton crew within CD Projekt to keep an eye on, while the game&#x27;s community decides on tweaks to exisiting cards to keep up with the current meta.

Patch notes promise &quot;optimised game stability on all platforms&quot; but for Nintendo Switch in particular, where developer Gameloft has put a &quot;considerable focus&quot; this time around. 


The popular Disney life sim is now fully compatible with Steam Deck and verified by Steam.

Following a four-week election process, should the majority of workers support unionisation, Microsoft, who purchased Zenimax for $7.5bn in 2021, will recognise the union. 


The company has also pledged to remain neutral throughout this process. &quot;We applaud Microsoft for remaining neutral through this process and letting workers decide for themselves whether they want a union,&quot; said CWA president Christopher Shelton.

                              <span>Microsoft has formally confirmed its offer of a 10-year contract to keep releasing Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms after its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In an opinion article on the deal published in the Wall St Journal,  Microsoft president Brad Smith committed to making its 10-year COD contract &quot;legally enforceable by regulators in the US, UK and European Union&quot; - territories in which the company was previously felt to be struggling to get its acquisition agreed without making some sort of concessions.


The majority of the opinion piece repeats the same arguments for the deal we&#x27;ve heard from Microsoft many times before - that it would be good for both consumers and game developers, and that Microsoft is still struggling in a sector where it is &quot;stuck behind Sony&#x27;s dominant PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox will join the growing trend of selling new blockbuster console games for $70 (likely £70) next year. 


This includes the biggest hitters from Microsoft&#x27;s first-party line-up for 2023, such as Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield, Arkane&#x27;s Redfall and the company&#x27;s own Forza Motorsport reboot.


Of course, as is standard on Xbox, all of these will continue to be made available on day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. There&#x27;s no suggestion today of any other pricing being changed - such as for that subscription service, or for Xbox hardware.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has shed more light on the reason why multiplayer never materialised for Cyberpunk 2077. 
Simply put, the game&#x27;s rocky 2020 launch changed the studio&#x27;s plans. CD Projekt Red had to prioritise fixing the single-player experience, and multiplayer suffered as a result.
&quot;We really needed to look at what were the priorities for Cyberpunk [after it launched],&quot; Philipp Weber told me when I visited the studio last week. Weber was senior quest designer and coordinator on Cyberpunk 2077. Today, he&#x27;s acting narrative director of the new Witcher game codenamed Polaris.

                              <span>Earlier this year, we were all surprised to hear that Henry Cavill was stepping away from Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher adaptation. In his stead, The Hunger Games&#x27; Liam Hemsworth would be taking over the role of Geralt of Rivia for the show&#x27;s fourth season.


Now, Netflix is doing what it can to reassure fans that, while this will clearly be a change for the series, it will also bring a &quot;different energy&quot; to the show that the producers are excited about.

Speaking at The Witcher: Blood Origin&#x27;s UK junket, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich addressed the series&#x27; recasting with a variety of outlets.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 will be re-released with a Game of the Year edition, developer CD Projekt has confirmed. 


As you might expect, this package will include next year&#x27;s paid-for Phantom Liberty expansion, as well as all other free updates released so far. 


The announcement of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s Game of the Year Edition package has raised some eyebrows considering the game&#x27;s state in the year that it launched, though the &quot;GOTY Edition&quot; branding has now been so over-used it should hardly come as a surprise.

                              <span>Music-mixing rhythm game Fuser will go offline on 19th December, developer Harmonix announced today. 


Existing owners of the game will be able to continue playing the game&#x27;s Campaign and Quick Play modes with any previously-purchased DLC after this date - though offline only. 


A blog post on Fuser&#x27;s website announced the shutdown of live services last week, and confirmed the game and its DLC would all be withdrawn from sale.

Many were expecting Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s release date to be revealed at The Game Awards this Thursday, so we will let you know when this date is made official.

In a statement issued this morning via Twitter, Panda confirmed it had &quot;heard the concerns of the Smash community&quot; and booted out its boss Alan Bunney. The company will now work with &quot;outside advisors to form a temporary interim management committee&quot; as players quit the company&#x27;s events in their dozens.


It follows a week of bad press for Bunney and his company, as it emerged Nintendo was shutting down a fan-run Smash Bros. tournament and continuing to partner with Panda.

                              <span>This weekend, we got another look at HBO&#x27;s upcoming The Last of Us TV adaptation. 


I am a big The Last of Us fan (something you may have noticed), and have watched this trailer multiple times already. Now, for your pleasure, I have pulled out some of the little details that you may have missed on a first watch. 


As a quick recap before we dive on in, you can see this trailer below. Please note, after the video I will be discussing points that could be considered spoilers for Naughty Dog&#x27;s video game series. If you are keen to avoid these, this is your cue to head elsewhere.

Ubatcha is one of the most popular sources for Genshin Impact leaks. As well as having over 460,000 followers on Twitter, Ubatcha posts in a Discord channel called Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, which has over 270,000 members.
It&#x27;s this Discord server that was targeted with a subpoena by the gatcha game&#x27;s publishing label Cognosphere.

                              <span>Blizzard&#x27;s Albany-based band of Diablo testers have now formally formed a union, following months of delay.


The small QA (quality assurance) team at Blizzard Albany first anounced its intent to unionise back in July this year. 


The team now becomes the second group of testers within Activision Blizzard to successfully do so, following the similarly long-running push by QA staff at Call of Duty studio Raven Software.

In the UK weekly boxed game chart, the new Need for Speed only managed to chart in 17th place - that&#x27;s behind last year&#x27;s Just Dance 2022 and the Lego Harry Potter Collection. 


UK sales data seen by GamesIndustry.biz reveals the game&#x27;s physical sales were down 64 percent on the series&#x27; previous entry, 2019&#x27;s Need for Speed: Heat.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission reportedly looks to be leaning towards an approval of Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover.


Previously, the FTC&#x27;s involvement in the deal had signalled a headache for Microsoft, which is facing regulatory approval around the world, and close scrutiny here in the UK. A lawsuit looked imminent - potentially blocking the acquisition, or carving out major concessions.


However, a fresh report by the New York Post into the FTC panel set to decide the deal&#x27;s fate suggests the trade body is now looking more likely to let it pass.

&quot;We are listening, working hard on updates, and will have details to share on more upcoming improvements early this week,&quot; the developer wrote before thanking everyone for their ongoing patience.

Forensic container checkpointing is based on Checkpoint/Restore In
Userspace (CRIU) and allows the creation of stateful copies
of a running container without the container knowing that it is being
checkpointed. The copy of the container can be analyzed and restored in a
sandbox environment multiple times without the original container being aware
of it. Forensic container checkpointing was introduced as an alpha feature in
Kubernetes v1.25.
How does it work?
With the help of CRIU it is possible to checkpoint and restore containers.
CRIU is integrated in runc, crun, CRI-O and containerd and forensic container
checkpointing as implemented in Kubernetes uses these existing CRIU
integrations.
Why is it important?

The studio confirmed that the teaser comes from an &quot;in-game cinematic&quot; taken from the fourth mainline installment of the franchise, Dreadwolf.

&quot;Elven god of lies or heroic rebel against tyranny?&quot; BioWare teased on Instagram. &quot;Depends who you ask. Happy #DragonAgeDay! We’re kicking today off with an in-game cinematic from #Dreadwolf!&quot;

                              <span>The creator of the acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer, Dead Cells, has revealed their next project: Nuclear Blaze. 

Sébastien Bénard&#x27;s Nuclear Blaze is expected to release on consoles on 28th April, 2023 and will set you back €15/$15 (sorry, I don&#x27;t have UK specific pricing at the time of writing) for a digital copy, and €30/$30 if you fancy a physical copy on either Switch or PS4. 

You&#x27;ll have to jump over to Red Art Games to pre-order a physical copy, although by doing so, you&#x27;ll secure a set of three &quot;Exclusive Nuclear Balze enamel pins&quot;. Physical copies also include a booklet including an interview with Bénard and a keychain.

As shared by TikToker KristaByte and then tweeted by streamer LuluLuvley, the organisation tasked three male professional Valorant players to jump online and play as usual, only halfway through, the players were asked to enable voice changers to make them sound more female. 

&quot;What do you think would happen if men disguised their voices in a Valorant lobby as women?&quot; Krista asked on TikTok.

There&#x27;s even an appearance from a-ha&#x27;s Take On Me, which some may remember from a particularly emotional scene in the game&#x27;s sequel, The Last of Us Part 2.

                              <span>Fortnite will be reborn on Sunday 4th December, when the game returns with its fresh Chapter 4 map.


The next era of Fortnite will welcome characters such as The Witcher&#x27;s Geralt, Doomslayer and The Hulk, plus new gameplay mechanics such as the addition of motorbikes to Epic&#x27;s hugely-popular battle royale.


Last night, Fortnite ditched its third map with shocking speed, as the game&#x27;s ever-changing Island was quickly consumed by the invading Chrome in a brief cutscene. Then followed an extended 30-minute event mode where players were tasked with reforging the Island anew, using a mix of familiar and fresh locales that look set to appear in Chapter 4.

                              <span>A patch is now available for the PC version of The Callisto Protocol.

Since the sci-fi horror released yesterday, players have taken to Striking Distance&#x27;s social media channels to complain about the stuttering plaguing the PC version of the game, which even Digital Foundry&#x27;s John calls &quot;unplayable&quot;.

Yesterday, the studio said in a statement: &quot;We&#x27;re aware that some users are experiencing stuttering issues on the PC. We&#x27;ve got a patch that will be available in a few hours to improve performance, with a number of additional updates on the way.&quot;

&quot;After over 11 and a half years on Halo, I step out of my Spartan armor for the last time today to head off to new adventures,&quot; French tweeted last night.

                              <span>Portal writer Erik Wolpaw says he has a &quot;pretty awesome starting point&quot; for the eagerly-anticipated Portal 3.

In an interview with DidYouKnowGaming?, Wolpaw offered some exciting behind-the-scenes secrets from the Portal series, including &quot;tidbits about Wheatley and Cave Johnson, unused lore, an unlikely inspiration from Super Metroid, cut content from Portal 2, and what the future might hold for Portal 3&quot;.

&quot;Yeah, Jay [Pinkerton] and I have an idea that we think is pretty awesome for what would happen, generally speaking,&quot; Wolpaw said (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;We don&#x27;t have a script or any details worked out, but we have sort of a starting point that we like a ton.

                              <span>We know that complexity is the worst enemy of security, because it makes attack easier and defense harder. This becomes catastrophic as the effects of that attack become greater.
In A Hacker’s Mind (coming in February 2023), I write:
Our societal systems, in general, may have grown fairer and more just over the centuries, but progress isn’t linear or equitable. The trajectory may appear to be upwards when viewed in hindsight, but from a more granular point of view there are a lot of ups and downs. It’s a “noisy” process.
Technology changes the amplitude of the noise. Those near-term ups and downs are getting more severe. And while that might not affect the long-term trajectories, they drastically affect all of us living in the short term. This is how the twentieth century could—statistically—both be the most peaceful in human history and also contain the most deadly wars...</span>

                              <span>Sifu, the acclaimed martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, is being turned into live-action movie by John Wick writer Derek Kolstad.


That&#x27;s according to Deadline, which suggests the movie will retain the same basic kung-fu-infused revenge plot as Sloclap&#x27;s video game, complete with the twist that its protagonist gets steadily older each time they&#x27;re resurrected by their magical pendant upon death, despite the world around them staying the same.


Deadline says the movie is being described as &quot;John Wick meets M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s Old&quot;.

It also introduces five species of butterfly that can be displayed as part of a walkthrough exhibit: the Cloudless Sulphur, European Peacock, Menelaus Blue Morpho, Monarch, and Old World Swallowtail.

                              <span>Developer Digital Extremes has announced the long-awaited arrival of cross-play support for its free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, meaning Tenno on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC can finally join forces wherever they may be.


Cross-play was initially announced during Digital Extremes&#x27; TennoCon fan event in July 2021, with the developer saying it hoped to launch the feature before the end of that year. It obviously missed that target and then some, but, 12 months later, cross-play is finally here.


&quot;Warframe will always be a game best played and enjoyed with friends and that&#x27;s why launching Cross Platform Play is such an incredible moment for us,&quot; Digital Extremes&#x27; chief operating officer Sheldon Carter said in a statement announcing the news. &quot;Together with our partners, we have broken down the walls that have prevented our players from experiencing the thrill of Warframe as one united community.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has shared a lengthy statement in response to recent claims it told organisers of the unofficial Smash World Tour that the popular fan competition, including this month&#x27;s concluding Smash World Tour Championships, could &quot;no longer operate&quot;.


The Smash World Tour, an &quot;international tournament circuit in which competitors for both Ultimate and Melee can qualify for the Smash World Tour Championships&quot;, is described by organisers as the &quot;the largest esports tour in history, for any game title&quot;. This year&#x27;s event, which ran between March and November, incorporated 6,400 live events around the world, attracting 325,000 in-person entrants.


With the tour now concluded, this year&#x27;s Smash World Tour Championships was due to beheld between 9th-11th December, but organisers announced on Tuesday (as reported by Kotaku) they had &quot;received notice the night before Thanksgiving from Nintendo that we could no longer operate&quot;. As such, December&#x27;s Championships and the entirety of next year&#x27;s Smash World Tour have been cancelled.

                              <span>The developer behind My Time At Portia has announced a new management sim, Let&#x27;s School, which is due to launch in 2023.


It&#x27;s a change of tack from a studio better known for its Harvest Moon-style life simulations - such as Portia and its follow-up My Time at Sandrock. Let&#x27;s School looks instead to be more in the vein of Theme Hospital - or more specifically, the recent school-set Two Point Campus.


Let&#x27;s School is described as a &quot;cosy and colourful&quot; management sim where, as headteacher, you design everything from the school&#x27;s building layout to its school clubs.

                              <span>Nintendo once had bold plans to quickly branch out into a raft of mobile game releases - but no more. When it launched its first app, Miitomo, back in 2016, Nintendo&#x27;s then-boss Tatsumi Kimishima said four more smartphone games would debut in the following 12 months.


In reality, Nintendo took several years to hit that milestone, and in the years since has shuttered several of them. Just one new Nintendo mobile game has launched in the last two years: Pikmin Bloom, developed by Pokémon Go maker Niantic.


This week, as Dragalia Lost joined Dr. Mario World and Miitomo on Nintendo&#x27;s shutdown game scrap pile, the publisher offered a brief update on the continued importance it places on its smartphone efforts.

                              <span>Neon White, the stylish Annapurna-published anime speedrunner, is coming to PlayStation platforms for the first time.


PlayStation 4 and PS5 versions of the game will arrive in just over a week, on Tuesday 13th December, following the game&#x27;s debut on Nintendo Switch and Steam earlier this year.


Neon White tasks you with shooting through levels - both in terms of the guns you fire and the speed in which you traverse. A single-player first-person shooter, it arms you with a variety of guns you can then trade-in for parkour moves via a card-based system, with the aim being to finish levels as quickly and cleanly as possible.

                              <span>Google has started refunding customers who purchased Stadia hardware through the Google Store.

Earlier this year, Google announced the closure of its beleaguered cloud gaming service, stating it aims to have all refunds completed by 18th January 2023 - the date Stadia servers are switched off for good.
Now, the Stadia Twitter account has confirmed that those who made their hardware purchases via its Google Store should start seeing their refunds coming in.

Debugging software in production is one of the biggest challenges we have to
face in our containerized environments. Being able to understand the impact of
the available security options, especially when it comes to configuring our
deployments, is one of the key aspects to make the default security in
Kubernetes stronger. We have all those logging, tracing and metrics data already
at hand, but how do we assemble the information they provide into something
human readable and actionable?
Seccomp is one of the standard mechanisms to protect a Linux based
Kubernetes application from malicious actions by interfering with its system
calls. This allows us to restrict the application to a defined set of
actionable items, like modifying files or responding to HTTP requests. …</span>

                              <span>Three Rare veterans - David Wise, Grant Kirkhope, and Kevin Bayliss - have banded together in the spirit of the holidays to release a video-game-themed Christmas single.


Long-time Rare fans should immediately recognise the trio&#x27;s contributions to the studio&#x27;s beloved back catalogue; Wise, for instance, was responsible for many memorable tracks in the Donkey Kong Country series (and provided the sublime score for Nintendo&#x27;s Tropical Freeze), more recently composing music for Sumo Digital&#x27;s Snake Pass and Playtonic&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee.


Kirkhope&#x27;s impressive credits include Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, Viva Piñata, and more recently, Ubisoft&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids, and Bayliss has designed characters for the likes of Battletoads, Killer Instinct, Diddy Kong Racing, and Yooka-Laylee. He was famously also behind Donkey Kong&#x27;s redesign.

                              <span>Jens Andersson, lead designer on Starbreeze Studios&#x27; acclaimed shooters The Darkness and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, has joined Wolfenstein developer MachineGames to serve as design director on its highly anticipated Indiana Jones project.


The new Indiana Jones game was unveiled early last year, although details were limited. It was described as featuring an &quot;original story&quot; unconnected to the upcoming Indiana Jones 5, with Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard executive producing in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games.


Andersson, who also helped create Eurogamer favourite Yoku&#x27;s Island Express, announced he&#x27;d joined as design director on the &quot;very special&quot; Indiana Jones project in a statement shared on Twitter (thanks VGC), explaining, &quot;I&#x27;m so excited about what we are building, and the way we get to do it - featuring one of [the] most iconic characters ever.&quot;

                              <span>We already knew Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest was set to return next year, but organisers now have a date for diaries everywhere, with 2023&#x27;s live showcase set to air on 8th June. Things are a little bit different in 2023, however, and next year&#x27;s event marks the first time Summer Game Fest will be open to the public.


The show - which promises a mix of premieres, live gameplay demos, and announcements - will take place at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California, in front of a live audience of fans. Tickets go on sale in &quot;early&quot; 2023, but for those unable or uninterested in attending in-person, Summer Game Fest will also stream live on all major streaming platforms.


Summer Game Fest 2023 marks the event&#x27;s fourth year of operation, and, as is now customary, the live showcase will kickstart a season of smaller events and showcases from participating developers and publishers. Specifics will follow at a later date.

                              <span>Frictional Games, the studio behind masterful sci-fi horror Soma, has announced a new entry in its acclaimed Amnesia series. It&#x27;s called Amnesia: The Bunker and is heading to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2023.


The Bunker - which will be the fourth Amensia game, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and last year&#x27;s Rebirth - promises to be something a little bit different, favouring &quot;unscripted&quot; semi-open-world horror over its predecessors&#x27; more linear scares.


&quot;For the first time, players are equipped with high levels of freedom to impact gameplay, choosing their playstyle as they explore at will,&quot; Frictional explains in its announcement. &quot;With hardly any scripted events, and constant tension brought about by an ever-present threat, it is up to each player to finesse their approach to survival.&quot;

The EA developer announced that Season 5 for the game has entered pre-production, which goes beyond the obligatory four seasons of content it owed to Year 1 battle pass subscribers. 


&quot;Across our team continuing to focus on Battlefield 2042, we have a mix of veteran developers alongside those working on their first game breathing in new life,&quot; DICE states in its latest blog post.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s one universal truth about Call of Duty players, it&#x27;s that they will spend as much money as needed to get even the slightest advantage over their peers. They would rather rage quit than be embarrassed by death.


So when Activision releases a premium skin bundle that makes it as difficult as possible for you to been seen by opponents, players will buy it in droves.


A new operator skin designed by Call of Duty eSports team LA Thieves puts players in an all-black outfit, allowing them to hide in shadows for some poor soul to pass by.

                              <span>Google has released a new interactive doodle in celebration of the life of Gerald &quot;Jerry&quot; Lawson, the Black video game engineer who invented the first cartridge-based home video game system. 


The doodle starts off with a tutorial the gives you a brief introduction to Jerry, before letting you enter an editor which allows you to create your very own retro arcade game. 


There are also five premade games to give you inspiration, and you use them as a template to edit from (or you can just play them if you&#x27;re not feeling creative).

Redditor Top_Scientist4578 datamined the item which will be available to purchase from Buy Stations around Al-Mazrah (the map which DMZ and Warzone is based in). 


Based on the screenshot, the item will cost $2000 in-game to purchase, although that&#x27;s probably a placeholder value.

                              <span>Capcom will hold a second Street Fighter 6 closed beta later this month, from 16th to 19th December. 


Tweaks to the game since its first round of testing include a fresh option on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S to &quot;reduce input delay&quot; as a setting in the game&#x27;s Graphics menu, which will &quot;shorten the gap between your inputs and the action happening on-screen&quot;.


Alternatively, on PC, you can toggle your Vsync setting off. The trade-off here is that this may increase the likelihood of screen-tearing, Capcom warns.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard has shed more light on Amazon&#x27;s upcoming Fallout adaptation.


Speaking on Lex Fridman&#x27;s podcast, the show&#x27;s executive producer stated that the upcoming series is &quot;not a retelling of a game story&quot;. Rather, it will take place on a separate area of the world&#x27;s map.



&quot;Let&#x27;s tell a story here that fits in the world that we have built, doesn&#x27;t break any of the rules, can reference things in the games, but isn&#x27;t a retelling of the games,&quot; Howard elaborated.

There are still a few surprises left in store, however - as spotted by Destiny dataminer MAK Moderator - including armour sets themed around Destiny and Monster Hunter characters. 


Destiny&#x27;s Crucible boss Lord Shaxx and Saint-14 will both see their armour sets recreated in Valhalla. There&#x27;s also an armour set designed to look like Monster Hunter&#x27;s Odogaron.

                              <span>In a nice surprise, Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s promised December update has been significantly bolstered - with the addition of Stitch (from Lilo and Stich) and a variety of Christmas extras, all on top of the previously-announced Toy Story expansion.


Stitch will be the third new character included in the free update, after Toy Story&#x27;s Woody and Buzz, as the popular Disney Pixar live service life simulation continues to grow in size. 


The update will also add winter outfits for your character and for NPCs (Merlin will dress up as Santa), the ability to build snowmen (how very Frozen), set up campfires and cook marshmallows.

The Game Pass Twitter handle began its own version of a hangman-like teaser a couple of days ago, merely saying it was a fun little guessing game being shared for &quot;no reason in particular&quot;. 


We were then all told that there were three words to guess, each consisting of four letters, and the second letter of the last word was an A.

When speaking about observability in the cloud native space, then probably
everyone will mention OpenTelemetry (OTEL) at some point in the
conversation. That&#x27;s great, because the community needs standards to rely on
for developing all cluster components into the same direction. OpenTelemetry
enables us to combine logs, metrics, traces and other contextual information
(called baggage) into a single resource. Cluster administrators or software
engineers can use this resource to get a viewport about what is going on in the
cluster over a defined period of time. But how can Kubernetes itself make use of
this technology stack?
Kubernetes consists of multiple components where some are independent and others
are stacked together. Looking at the architecture from a containe…</span>

                              <span>Uncharted&#x27;s live-action movie adaptation is getting a live-action roller coaster adaptation, with the newly announced attraction coming to Barcelona&#x27;s PortAventura World next year.


Due to open &quot;midway through&quot; 2023, the officially licensed Uncharted ride is a &quot;multi-dimensional&quot; dark ride coaster that&#x27;ll take riders on an &quot;immersive and exciting&quot; adventure through &quot;unexplored territories&quot; in search of &quot;one of the greatest treasures never found&quot;.


Kicking off with a &quot;pre-show full of surprises&quot;, the rollercoaster itself will feature 700m of track reaching up to 12m in height, and incorporate five launches with up to 1G of acceleration.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s highly anticipated The Duviri Paradox expansion might be delayed, but today brings a little something new to tide players over until its arrival next year, courtesy of the survival-based Lua&#x27;s Prey update, available now on all platforms.


&quot;As The Void exposes ancient scars and long-forgotten secrets,&quot; developer Digital Extremes says of its latest update, &quot;something sinister rumbles on Lua as the Grineer descend upon these newly exposed halls seeking possible treasure, corrupted by its long-dormant Orokin Neural Sentry. Under the guidance of The Lotus, the Tenno embark on a mission to investigate this destroyed piece of Lua formerly used to monitor Void Conjunctions.&quot;


Lua&#x27;s Prey serves as a &quot;light prequel&quot; to The Duviri Paradox, adding two new story-based Conjunction Survival missions featuring thematic teasers for next year&#x27;s expansion. These can be located at two newly added Lua nodes - Yuvarium and Circulus - and challenge players to maintain Life Support in the usual way. The twist, though, is that a Thrax enemy will spawn after every successful Survival round, increasing Life Support depletion by 50% while it remains alive, and requiring players to summon their Necramechs in order to defeat it.

                              <span>Sega has unveiled a new post-launch content roadmap for Sonic Frontiers, promising the likes of new playable characters and story content across three free DLC updates throughout 2023.


There&#x27;s no estimated time of arrival for any of Sonic Frontier&#x27;s newly announced updates, but the first will introduce a juke box, photo mode, and a selection of new challenge modes. That&#x27;ll be followed by a second update celebrating Sonic&#x27;s birthday - and adding new Koco and a new open zone challenge - suggesting Sega&#x27;s aiming for a June-ish launch for this one.


Finally, there&#x27;s the biggie, with Sonic Frontiers&#x27; third free update of 2023 teasing new story content and playable characters. The artwork for Update 3 features Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, but it&#x27;s unclear if these are the new playable characters or just a placeholder design flourish.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise, the stellar latest entry in Capcom&#x27;s long-running creature-bopping series, will reportedly be making the jump to PlayStation and Xbox in January next year.


Rise initially launched as a Switch console exclusive last March, with a PC release arriving in January this year. Both versions then received the game&#x27;s major Sunbreak expansion in July.


And now it seems Monster Hunter Rise is ready to spread its Rathalos-sized wings once more, with prolific leaker Tom Henderson&#x27;s Insider Gaming reporting Capcom will bring the acclaimed title to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass on 20th January 2023.

                              <span>Twitch has implemented a new Shield Mode feature, allowing streamers to pre-set safety settings.


The feature offers customisable controls that can be activated in one click, including channel modes (such as follower or sub only chat), chat verification options, and AutoMod levels.


This is a much requested feature, especially in the wake of last summer&#x27;s hate raids against streamers from minority communities, which remain ongoing.

                              <span>Amazon has revealed the next batch of titles being made available to Prime subscribers as part of December&#x27;s Prime Gaming line-up, which this time includes classic FPS Quake and the wonderful Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.


id Software&#x27;s Quake is, of course, a stone-cold classic, serving up a seminal slice of FPS action that - somewhat unbelievably - celebrated its 25th anniversary last year.


Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons mightn&#x27;t be quite as well-known, but its story of two siblings on an increasingly fantastical quest to find a cure for their father&#x27;s mysterious affliction is an absolute delight, and a game I find myself returning to every couple of years. The gist is players must overcome its various platform and puzzle challenges by controlling both brothers simulataneously, but it&#x27;s also gained a proper two-player co-op mode over the years.

                              <span>Furry Hentai Tangram is a puzzle game where players must slot shapes into a grid to reveal lewd anime pictures underneath. It&#x27;s also available on the Nintendo Switch eShop priced £2.39 (currently reduced from £2.99). 


The fact this game, which launched last Friday, is available on the notoriously family-friendly Nintendo Switch has raised eyebrows among users uncomfortable with their kids finding its store page on the Nintendo eShop. 


&quot;Seriously Nintendo... this is my eight year old cousin&#x27;s account,&quot; wrote one fan on reddit, sharing a screenshot of the game - visible from Furry Hentai Tangram&#x27;s store page - depicting a mostly-undressed character with cat ears.

There&#x27;s a lot of emotional beats in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. And fans have noticed how empty it feels when the cutscenes have no voice acting, but could really benefit from some.
A group of Pokémon fans, who are also voice actors, have come together to dub over some of the game&#x27;s cutscenes to imagine what the game would be like with voice-over.

                              <span>Well, this is a nice surprise. Not only is the final content update for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla now live on all platforms - a week earlier than planned! - but it includes a surprise tie-in to next year&#x27;s Bagdhad-based Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage. 


We were expecting this last chapter of Eivor&#x27;s story to arrive next week, on 6th December. Announcing its early release last night, Ubisoft blamed &quot;an unforeseen glitch in the Animus&quot;. 


As expected, this final dollop of Valhalla storyline sees Eivor wrap up her time in England and head off to North America one last time - where the game&#x27;s opening shows she is buried. There&#x27;s time for a few final goodbyes with some noteworthy people from Valhalla&#x27;s long campaign, and then it&#x27;s off to find out more about what Odin has been up to.

                              <span>Nintendo has now released its second trailer for the Super Mario Bros. Movie, giving us our best look yet at the upcoming animated film from Minions maker Illumination. 


The trailer showcases a good look at the film&#x27;s version of Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Tayor-Joy) while Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario only gets a couple of lines of dialogue. Overall, it&#x27;s a fun glimpse at some familiar Mario locales and characters, translated for the big screen. 


If you&#x27;re a Nintendo nerd like me, you&#x27;ve probably rewatched the trailer more than once to spot everything going on in the background. And there&#x27;s some cool Easter eggs - particularly if you like the extended Donkey Kong family. Let&#x27;s give it one more watch and dive in.

                              <span>More glitches have been discovered in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (who would have thunk it) which allow players to duplicate items, and even their legendary Pokémon.
Plenty of bugs and exploits have already been found, whether it&#x27;s creating body horror or duplicating shiny Pokémon, but this is on a different level. In the game, you&#x27;re supposed to only have one of the legendaries, whether that&#x27;s Koraidon or Miraidon, but now you can fill up your boxes with them.
These new-found glitches have been widely discussed in the Pokémon community, and they&#x27;re not that difficult to pull off. One has been tested by yours truly, and I can confirm it works. The other requires you to have beaten the end-game, which I&#x27;ve not reached yet so I can&#x27;t confirm at the moment whether it works or not. Beware some spoilers ahead!

                              <span>Xbox Games with Gold still trundles on, and Microsoft has now confirmed December&#x27;s titles for Xbox Live members as Colt Canyon and Bladed Fury


Colt Canyon is described as an &quot;atmospheric and punchy&quot; rogue-like shooter set in a pixel-art Wild West, where players can root and toot their way toward saving their kidnapped partner from ruthless bandits. &quot;Take your gun and TNT,&quot; explains developer Retrific, &quot;and shoot your way through a hostile canyon full of hidden treasures, weapons, obstacles and all kinds of bloodthirsty scum.&quot;


Eurogamer hasn&#x27;t scanned a critical eye over Colt Canyon, but with a Very Positive rating over on Steam, the masses appear to think this one is pretty good!

                              <span>After a solid first showing for the long-awaited Super Mario Bros. Movie in October, Nintendo has returned with a second action-packed trailer, this time giving us a first proper look at Peach, Donkey Kong, and a delightful karting cameo for Rainbow Road.


In fact, it&#x27;s a bit of a treat for Mario fans all-round, casting its net wide to introduce a host of familiar faces, places, and power-ups, all given a vibrant movie makeover. It&#x27;s the first time we get to hear Anya Taylor-Joy&#x27;s no-nonsense Princess Peach, for instance, as well as Charlie Day as Luigi, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong, even though the latter&#x27;s debut was mainly just a grunt.


Elsewhere, the trailer delivers a breakneck tour of the movie&#x27;s beautifully reimagined Mushroom Kingdom, giving us a stroll across a bridge amid of flurry of Cheep Cheeps, a glimpse inside Peach&#x27;s castle, and, of course, the crowd-pleasing addition of karts hurtling across Rainbow Road.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR - developer Supermassive Games&#x27; rail-shooter spin on its acclaimed narrative horror series - has been confirmed as a launch day title for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation VR 2, meaning it&#x27;ll arrive on 22nd February next year.


Switchback isn&#x27;t Supermassive&#x27;s first foray into spooky VR, of course; it previously adapted its cinematic horror game Until Dawn into both a VR prequel and a gaudy, rollercoaster-like rail shooter called Rush of Blood. And Dark Pictures: Switchback VR is very much a spiritual successor to the latter, sending players on a &quot;nightmarish and horrifying&quot; branching VR thrill ride through scenes that should be familiar to Dark Pictures fans.


&quot;Survive the Ghost Ship and its distorted apparitions,&quot; Supermassive teases, &quot;confront hideous demonic incarnations of persecuted &#x27;witches&#x27;. Fight for your life against other-worldly vampires and escape the horrifying World&#x27;s Fair Hotel&#x27;s sadistic serial killer.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft has unveiled Lost Between Worlds, a new expansion for Far Cry 6 that&#x27;ll whisk players away to a fractured alien version of Yara when it launches on 6th December.


Lost Between Worlds&#x27; surreal extraterrestrial action begins when Far Cry 6 protagonist Dani Rojas inadvertently stumbles across a crashed alien ship inhabited by an alein AI known as FAI. Unfortunately for Dani, FAI immediately seals the surrounding area and demands they embark on a quest to retrieve five crystals needed to repair their ship - each one hidden away in a mysterious rift containing a fractured simulation of Yara.


There are familiar locations twisted into a surreal architectural kaleidoscope, others plunged deep underwater, and still others ravaged by endless lightning storms. Every rift features multiple routes via orange and purple portals, and players will need to use their combat, parkour, and puzzle skills to pick their way through and retrieve the crystal housed in each one.

                              <span>A three-year study into the impact of video game loot boxes on young people has concluded that such mechanics cause &quot;financial and emotional harm&quot; to teenagers and children. 


The report, published by Newcastle and Loughborough Universities, tracked the gaming habits of 42 families with children aged between five and 17, and interviewed another 30 parents, carers and video game designers.


In short, the study found children struggled to track spending in video games where &quot;highly alluring&quot; digital items were advertised to them using techniques borrowed from regulated gambling.

Wilkie first stated his intention to introduce the Classication Amendment (Loot Boxes) Bill last year (via Kotaku Australia). Back then, he wanted any games with loot boxes to be given a R18+ rating, and a new &quot;advisory&quot; classification to highlight their presence.
The bill was filed yesterday by Wilkie, and the details of it can be viewed on the Australian government&#x27;s website.

However, one image that probably isn&#x27;t immediately conjured up in your head when thinking about Rockstar&#x27;s long-standing franchise is a whopping great big dinosaur rampaging the streets. And yet, this is actually the sort of game Grand Theft Auto started life off as. 


Speaking to the BBC alongside the series&#x27; 25th anniversary, developer Colin Macdonald revealed &quot;GTA went through a lot of different iterations and [had] quite a troubled development&quot;, stating the first game &quot;wasn&#x27;t really regarded well for most of the time it was in production.&quot;

                              <span>Bohemia Interactive, developer of military simulation game Arma 3, has asked fans to watch out for edited in-game videos being shared around social media that are falsely labelled as real-world war footage.


Specifically, Bohemia has called for players and content creators to &quot;use their game footage responsibly&quot;, &quot;refrain from using clickbait video titles&quot; and &quot;always state clearly that the video originated from a video game&quot; rather than footage from a real-life conflict.


Arma 3 gameplay videos have a history of being mistaken for real-world footage - even by professional news organisations - and this problem has only increased since the current conflict in Ukraine has begun, Bohemia said.

As promised, Warzone has been quietly relaunched as Caldera, albeit on life support, as Ishraq put it earlier.

                              <span>Sony has revealed a set of six motion-tracking gadgets that will allow a user&#x27;s body to mimic an avatar&#x27;s moves.


Known as Mocopi, this set will enable mobile motion capture, thanks to sensors worn around a user&#x27;s head, waist, wrists and ankles. When paired with the compatible smartphone app, these trackers can then be used to animate an avatar within said app. 


In addition to adding your avatar to real-world locations, users will also be able to combine avatars and background images within the app. Meanwhile, it will also use VRChat as a motion input device. You can see just how Mocopi looks in action via the trailer below.

                              <span>The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has described the upcoming remake of the series&#x27; first game as a &quot;story-driven, single-player open-world RPG - a modern reimagining of 2007&#x27;s The Witcher&quot;.


It&#x27;s the first detailed description we&#x27;ve had of the remake, and suggests a more from-the-ground-up reworking of the original role-player than previously thought. 


Thanks to the success of The Witcher 3, the series is now thought of as a fully open-world franchise. But that was not the case back in the original Witcher game, which featured a number of separate large maps and various smaller areas.

                              <span>If it&#x27;s bug squishing you want, you&#x27;re in luck; developer Offworld Industries has unveiled Starship Troopers: Extermination, a new 12-player, squad-based co-op FPS coming to Steam early access next year.


Inspired by Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s cult-classic 1997 movie, Starship Troopers: Extermination drops up to three squads of four players onto the front lines amid an Arachnid assault, challenging them to work together to complete objectives, acquire resources, build and defend their base of operations, and finally escape to the extraction zone.


There are three classes to choose from - Assault, Support, and Defense, each with their own weapons, equipment, and perks - alongside a base building system that sees players using resources acquired from planetside refineries to construct walls, towers, ammo stations, and various other amenities in an effort to gain the upper hand in battle.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s much-delayed The Settlers reboot has resurfaced once more, bringing with it a new name - it&#x27;ll now be known as The Settlers: New Allies - and a 17th February 2023 release date on PC, with console versions to follow.


This latest release date marks Ubisoft&#x27;s fourth attempt at getting its Settlers reboot out the door; when the publisher first revealed it was revisiting the series&#x27; much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula back in 2018, the reboot was expected to arrive in autumn the following year. That wasn&#x27;t to be, though, and the game was first pushed into 2020 before being postponed indefinitely as summer 2020 rolled around.


It seemed like the end was finally in sight for patient The Settlers fans at the start of this year, however, when Ubisoft announced a new 17th March release date for its reboot - but, following less-than-stellar closed beta feedback, the publisher slammed on the breaks once more, only saying the game would instead launch at &quot;a later date&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly readying to make a number of formal concessions to EU regulators investigating its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, including the guarantee Call of Duty will be availalble on PlayStation for the next ten years.


Call of Duty has remained a focal point during government scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard deal, with regulators - including those in the UK and Europe - raising fears Microsoft may leverage the juggernaut franchise to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.


Reports in September revealed Microsoft had initially pledged to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for &quot;at least several more years&quot; beyond Activision&#x27;s existing deal - an arrangement PlayStation boss Jim Ryan would go on to call &quot;inadequate on many levels&quot; - but as regulatory scrutiny deepened, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said the company would continue releasing Call of Duty on Sony&#x27;s consoles for &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to&quot;.

                              <span>Pokémon Go has revealed details of its ninth season, Mythical Wishes, which will carry the game through the next three months: from 1st December to 1st March. 


Mythical Wishes is a reference to Hoenn&#x27;s Mythical creature Jirachi, which has only appeared in Pokémon Go once previously. It looks set for a reappearance (and possible Shiny debut?) at 2023&#x27;s Pokémon Go Tour event, which is set to be detailed fully tomorrow. More tangibly, today&#x27;s new trailer also teases the release of Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre at the end - some of the most powerful creatures in the series, and a big deal for fans.


Hoenn creatures dominate much of the next season, with the introduction of the region&#x27;s three Starter creatures in their Mega evolved forms: Mega Sceptile, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Swampert. The trio will debut via a Raid Day event this Saturday, 3rd December which will offer a number of extra free raid passes.

                              <span>Three years after it released on PC, Red Dead Redemption 2 broke its all-time peak of concurrent players yesterday.
Single-player DLC for the game looks unlikely, and the bundled multiplayer offering Red Dead Online was pronounced &quot;dead&quot; by its community of players after developer Rockstar confirmed it would no longer push major updates to the game to shift development to Grand Theft Auto 6 instead.
That hasn&#x27;t put people off enjoying Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, however (with some help from the Thanksgiving holidays across the pond and Steam&#x27;s autumn sale).

&quot;Add speakers, a microphone and a Full HD camera, and you have the smartest dog tech product to ever hit the market,&quot; Joipaw proclaims on the console&#x27;s reservation page.

In 2021, Goddard hosted a reddit AMA where he admitted F-Zero was his favourite game on the SNES and that his studio had created an F-Zero prototype with ultra-realistic physics that was never released. DidYouKnowGaming dug deeper.

                              <span>Activision was kept busy over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend fixing a popular Call of Duty glitch which granted infinite money and weapon XP. 


The now-fixed exploit let you repeatedly sell weapons at the game&#x27;s Buy Stations in exchange for XP. In a quick fix for the issue, XP from Buy Stations was nerfed to counter the number of people quickly levelling up their weapons. 


But, as fans quickly found, this still left the game&#x27;s white dumpster Dead Drops as an option. This lasted another half day or so, until it too was countered by another behind the scenes change.

The horror franchise&#x27;s first two titles - Man of Medan and Little Hope - were updated on 28th September with a spruce-up designed to introduce difficulty settings, QTE warnings and more accessibility options. Man of Medan even gained a &quot;previously unseen&quot; story chapter. 


But these updates also had the unintended consequence of introducing a raft of bugs to the games, with a number of players complaining of being unable to save or make progress past certain points.

                              <span>Fran Lebowitz once said, &quot;You&#x27;re only as good as your last haircut,&quot; and perhaps she has a point. After all, Joel Miller from Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us series is easily recognisable, with his full head of hair and slightly scruffy facial furniture. 


However, it turns out that if you remove all of his hair (bar his eyebrows, thank goodness), he looks really quite different... and I am not sure that is a good thing.


As shared by prolific modder Speclizer, who recently unlocked God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s unfinished photo mode, there is now a The Last of Us Part 2 mod that makes Joel&#x27;s head and face almost as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet players have noticed that the RNG of the Battle Stadium is not working as intended.


As shared on reddit, user Lord-Trolldemort noticed that the accuracy of certain moves was rigged.


And as the Battle Stadium is the game&#x27;s ranked online mode, this could have serious implications.

In what was presumably an oversight from the developers at Game Freak - and not intentional - fans have found you can align your character and Meowscarada just a little too well, allowing for a kiss-like interaction when out picnicking.
Why would you want to kiss Meowscarada? Well, when its design leaked shortly before launch, people quickly made hordes of fan art, some of which was not particularly wholesome or Safe For Work.

The leak contains audio files including dialogue, as well as assets and artwork, and appears to have come from someone able to bypass Epic Games&#x27; own in-game encryption for these files. 


Eurogamer will not be spoiling any details of the event itself ahead of time.

The mod, created by theboy181, is not yet complete or publicly available, but videos have been posted on Twitter showing the smoother frame rate.


Of course, this is all happening on a PC emulator rather than the Switch directly.

                              <span>Following his appointment as co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios alongside Peter Safran, filmmaker James Gunn has confirmed that future DC video games will indeed be part of a larger connected universe for the Warner Bros. franchise. 
 
In a back and forth on Twitter, Gunn stated the &quot;DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).&quot; When asked further if this statement also included games, Gunn replied with a simple and clear &quot;yes&quot;.
This news is not surprising. Earlier reports revealed that Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav had spoken to the wider company about plans to &quot;build a bible for a cohesive DC universe&quot; that would include media such as &quot;live-action films, TV, animation, gaming and more&quot;.

                              <span>Laptop technicians routinely violate the privacy of the people whose computers they repair:
Researchers at University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, recovered logs from laptops after receiving overnight repairs from 12 commercial shops. The logs showed that technicians from six of the locations had accessed personal data and that two of those shops also copied data onto a personal device. Devices belonging to females were more likely to be snooped on, and that snooping tended to seek more sensitive data, including both sexually revealing and non-sexual pictures, documents, and financial information...</span>

Starting with Kubernetes 1.25, our container image registry has changed from k8s.gcr.io to registry.k8s.io. This new registry spreads the load across multiple Cloud Providers &amp; Regions, functioning as a sort of content delivery network (CDN) for Kubernetes container images. This change reduces the project’s reliance on a single entity and provides a faster download experience for a large number of users.
TL;DR: What you need to know about this change
Container images for Kubernetes releases from 1.25 onward are no longer published to k8s.gcr.io, only to registry.k8s.io.
In the upcoming December patch releases, the new registry domain default will be backported to all branches still in support (1.22, 1.23, 1.24).

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers&#x27; 1.10 update is about to be deployed, seemingly starting with PlayStation consoles.

The update primarily hopes to address bugs and issues with the game, as well as provide some additional - if unspecified - quality-of-life improvements for players.

Whilst the game&#x27;s English-language social media channels have yet to publicise the patch, the blue blur&#x27;s Japanese counterpart has, revealing that the update is now ready for PS4 and PS5 now and will be available for other platforms &quot;in the near future&quot;.

In a &quot;special message from Firaxis&quot; posted to YouTube, the team outlined their favourite aspects of the upcoming tactical role playing game, and it included confirmation that there&#x27;ll be a lot of cut-scenes and conversations as you foster relationships with your teammates.

&quot;I think we ended up with something like 65,000 lines of voiced dialogue, over two hours of cinematics, and, gosh, more branching choices than you could imagine,&quot; lead engineer Will Miller said in the interview (thanks, PC Gamer).

In an interview with GTPlanet (thanks, VGC), Yamauchi was asked if he would &quot;consider&quot; following the recent trends set by Sony first-party titles like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Death Stranding by taking the latest instalment, Gran Turismo 7, to PC.

&quot;Yes, I do think so,&quot; Yamauchi responded when asked if Polyphony Digital could do the same.

No, I&#x27;m not talking about the (also horrifying) Rock Bottom episode where SpongeBob gets stuck in Glove World; it turns out that the way animated characters move have inspired the character director of The Callisto Protocol, too.

“Some creatures came from the art perspective, though, like, &#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s just do something that is very crazy looking&#x27;. And then we put that in the game and find a way of making it work,&quot; character director Glauco Longhi told  GLHF, via The Sun.

                              <span>As our friends across the water settled down after their Thanksgiving celebrations, gaming seems to have been at the forefront of their minds because - would you believe it - Steam&#x27;s broken its own concurrent record. Yes. Again.

Whilst the number includes players who are idle - that is, signed in but not actively playing anything - Steam&#x27;s own analytics show that a new peak of 31,349,780 concurrent players was set over the weekend. 

As is often the case, third-party tracker SteamDB boasts a slightly different number - a higher figure of 31,379,760 concurrent players - 9.3 of whom were actively online and gaming at the time the record was set.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 has been rated in South Korea. 

As spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at Resetera, the fighting game - which, as yet, does not have a firm release date beyond a very vague &quot;2023&quot; window - has secured a 15 age rating due to its &quot;expression of physical damage shown in illustrations in addition to basic fighting expression&quot;.

Whilst this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that a release is just around the corner, it does intimate that it&#x27;s probably set to drop in the next six months or so… and with The Game Awards just a few days away now, many fans are speculating that we may get that all-important release date then. Watch this space, eh?

That&#x27;s according to Ubisoft&#x27;s own social media posts, which revealed that on 6pm UK time on 29th November (that&#x27;s 10am PT), the team will broadcast a &quot;reveal livestream&quot; about the upcoming expansion on its official Twitch channel.

Whilst the developer stopped short of revealing what, exactly, the new content includes, we do get a brief little teaser that includes hints about Fortnite-like crystals and portals. Here, take a peek:

That&#x27;s right; some players have discovered how to make boats fly, elevating them high into the air to avoid the battlefield entirely and coast to victory. Here&#x27;s one in action: 

It&#x27;s also perhaps the one good thing I&#x27;ve seen come from proximity chat so far, too; rather than eliminate their enemies, the hackers are using the chat feature to invite randoms into their ship where they sail across the sky instead of the clear blue waters, like this example below (thanks, PC Gamer):

                              <span>Several videos purportedly featuring footage from the as yet unreleased Need for Speed Unbound have leaked online.

The footage - uploaded by MrCarrot1890 and Lvneth on YouTube and spotted by the fine folks at Resetera - currently consists of numerous videos that culminate in about an hour of gameplay. It predates not only the 2nd December release date but also the early access period,too,  which is supposed to go live on 29th November.

Interestingly, it doesn&#x27;t look like the YouTube accounts in question took the footage themselves, as two of the videos were recorded from a Twitch livestream broadcast by someone called gerrykurlsucks, and another from a content creator called Chocolove95.

Acknowledging that &quot;part of the success&quot; of the sequel &quot;undeniably goes to the game’s remarkable score&quot;, the team held an &quot;exceptional concert for the occasion of the game’s release&quot; which is now available on YouTube.

&quot;A Plague Tale: Requiem, the spectacular, grounded medieval adventure within a violent fantasy world, has been nominated in no less than five categories for The Game Awards 2022, including the coveted Game of the Year award!&quot; the team explains. &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled by this exciting chance, which confirms the overwhelmingly positive reception of the game.

&quot;Our team has reviewed, and made critical updates to, the profanity filter to help prevent this from happening again in the future,&quot; the team explained.

                              <span>It looks like Epic Games will once again be running its festive freebie giveaway over the Christmas period.

Confirmation came via Dealabs leaker billbil-kun who - as well as confirming that Star Wars: Squadrons is currently free to add to your Epic Games Store library from now until next Thursday, 1st December - dropped a hint that the Epic Games Store will once again be running its &quot;Advent Calendar&quot; event.

&quot;Do you know if we&#x27;ll have an advent calendar again in December? (1 set per day)&quot;, asked a curious poster, to which billbil-kun replied: &quot;Yes, somewhere between December 15, 2022 and January 10, 2023,&quot; (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>Following yet another delay for its exceedingly long-in-the-works Dead Island 2, publisher Quick Silver has announced the zombie shooter sequel will be getting its first proper airing in quite some time on Tuesday, 6th December.


Dead Island 2 was, somewhat unbelievably, initially unveiled all the way back in 2014, promising more of the kind of co-operative zombie shooting action that had made developer Techland&#x27;s enjoyable 2011 original a bit of a hit.


Since then, though, development has been turbulent, with the sequel missing its initially announcement 2015 release date and losing its original developer - Spec Ops: The Line studio Yager - that same year. Eight months later, British developer Sumo Digital was revealed to have taken over the project, but another studio switch was still to come when Homefront: The Revolution maker Dambuster Studios took the reins in 2019.

In August, Sifu received a beefy content update, which featured a new scoring system and modifiers which allowed players to customise the difficulty. Two new outfits were also added, and Slocap teased more to come in the autumn update.
Included in the roadmap for Sifu in the autumn update is the replay editor and additional modifiers. Slocap shared a brief look at the replay editor on the official Twitter account for Sifu.

                              <span>A 20-year-old mod for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind has just had a major content update, adding two new expansions.

The team behind Tamriel Rebuilt has been releasing content for Morrowind since 2002, though its conception happened in 2001 before Morrowind was released.

21 years later, the project is still going strong. In its first update in nearly two years, the project has added two more expansions with new areas of Tamriel to explore (thanks PC Gamer).

Robertson became somewhat of an internet darling following her portrayal of the towering and beguiling Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village. She won legions of fans for her part in Capcom&#x27;s long running series, and even won a few awards for it too.


Needless to say, dear reader, I am one of those fans, and since hearing she was a part of God of War Ragnarök, I have been eager to find her character in the game.

                              <span>Hinterland Studio&#x27;s superb snowy survival adventure The Long Dark is getting its first paid expansion on 5th December and, ahead of release, the developer has detailed all it&#x27;ll bring.


Tales from the Far Territory, as the new expansion is known, releases in six parts over the course of 12 months, each arriving approximately every 8-10 weeks. All six parts will focus on The Long Dark&#x27;s much-loved Survival mode, but there are narrative elements in there and Hinterland is referring to the complete series as a &quot;campaign&quot;.


Exactly what will be coming when is currently unclear, but Hinterland has now detailed all the major features it&#x27;ll be introducing to Survival mode throughout the expansion. There are three new areas, for instance - the Forsaken Airfield, Industrial Mine, and Mountain Pass - all accessible via the Far Range Branchline and Transfer Pass hub.

                              <span>It&#x27;s barely been a week since American Truck Simulator thundered across the Texan border, but already SCS Software is setting course for a new destination, with the developer having now confirmed Oklahoma as the trucking sim&#x27;s next DLC expansion.


Oklahoma will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 12th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas - and its announcement isn&#x27;t all that unexpected given SCS&#x27; continued left-to-right march across the US, and Oklahoma slotting so neatly above the recently released Texas.


&quot;While Oklahoma tends to have an unfortunate reputation of being a rather arid place,&quot; SCS writes in its announcement post, &quot;sometimes it&#x27;s much better to avoid judging a book by its cover. The state is home to wonderful national parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends. And if you are looking for something more practical instead, the local road network and a strong economy will keep every trucker properly busy.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s fair to say Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have caused their share of complaints. Now, fans are upset that a Pokémon is too good. 


Fire starter Fuecoco has been branded as &quot;broken&quot; by proponents of Pokémon&#x27;s &quot;Nuzlocke&quot; style of gameplay - the fan-invented method of playing Pokémon which essentially amounts to permadeath. 


Any Pokémon which faints in a Nuzlocke run is considered dead and must be released back into the wild. Additionally, you may only catch the first creature in any area and no other, severely limiting the number of Pokémon at your disposal.

However, it will also bring along with it something that is, perhaps, not quite so welcome. 


Why yes, Witcher fans, this next-gen update will also include Netflix&#x27;s take (at least for its first season) on the Nilfgaardian army&#x27;s armour.

                              <span>As the World Cup kicks off, video game publishers have of course devised strategies to cash-in on the hype. EA has an officially licenced World Cup mode in FIFA 23, while Epic has some not-so-official World Cup skins in Fortnite.   


Activision falls under the latter category with what is possibly the most creative (or bizarre) tie-in I have ever seen. 


In Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2/Warzone 2.0, players can now vote on which team they think will win future matches. Those who guess correctly get 10,000 XP, that national team&#x27;s flag as a Calling Card, oh and a remix of their national anthem.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing the PlayStation 6 - specifically, Sony&#x27;s concerns about Call of Duty not being available on the upcoming platform, which we now know will debut sometime from 2027 onwards. 

It&#x27;s been another week dominated by news of Microsoft&#x27;s $68bn Activision Blizzard takeover attempt, which is currently being scrutinised by the UK&#x27;s anti-competition regulator. Partially-redacted documentation from this process has now been made public, revealing some eyebrow-raising arguments from Sony - which is trying to block the deal. 
Both Sony and Microsoft have gone on the defensive to make themselves look the smaller fish - with Microsoft  admitting Sony&#x27;s exclusives are better and Sony saying any loss of Call of Duty would leave itself &quot;extremely vulnerable&quot;, particularly if the series was made available through the popular Xbox Game Pass. So, should Sony be worried - or is this all just performative theatrics? Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

Ghost&#x27;s face has been one of Call of Duty&#x27;s biggest mysteries since his introduction. Just who is it that hides behind that slightly unnerving facial covering? 


Well, this mystery is a mystery no more, as Ghost has - quite literally - been unmasked by Redditor Crafty-Astronomer905 (thanks PCGamesN).

                              <span>Modern Warfare 2 players are paying real money on eBay to unlock a hard-to-gain weapon in-game. 


The M13B Assault Rifle is contentiously locked behind a challenge in Warzone&#x27;s DMZ mode and is a massive pain in the bottom to complete. 


However, players have also found a neat trick that means that only one person in your group of friends has to complete the challenge. That player can then &quot;drop&quot; the weapon for other members of the squad to pick up, extract, and unlock.

                              <span>Fresh details of the legal battle between Disco Elyisum creatives and their former bosses have emerged, as part of a hearing held in an Estonian court. 


To recap on the story so far: a trio of high profile staff behind the first Disco Elysium game were fired from developer ZA/UM following the company&#x27;s takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus, who is now ZA/UM&#x27;s boss and controlling shareholder, and Tõnis Haavel who was previously convicted of investment fraud. 


On the one side, some of the staff - including Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - have previously alleged that Kompus and Haavel&#x27;s takeover was fraudulent, and that they were booted out when trying to discover more. On the other, Kompus and Haavel have claimed the firings were due to some staff creating a &quot;toxic environment&quot; - and they were allegedly planning to depart the studio anyway to try and build a Disco Elysium sequel elsewhere.

                              <span>EA has apologised after the Need for Speed Twitter account branded a fan as a &quot;milkshake brain&quot;.


The exchange followed news that players who pre-order the forthcoming Need for Speed Unbound: Palace Edition will receive three days of early access ahead of release.


One particular fan criticised this, which began an argument in which the official account called the fan &quot;milkshake brain&quot; and told them to &quot;cry about it bro or buy regular price idc&quot;.

                              <span>When you think of Call of Duty, you think of John &quot;Soap&quot; McTavish. Along with Captain Price and Ghost, his is just a name that immediately springs to mind whenever you talk about Activision&#x27;s shooter.


But while Soap is certainly a key part of the series, there are still some aspects of his persona that are left untold. Well, this list of unknown attributes just got a little shorter, thanks to his Modern Warfare 2 bio.


Here, it is revealed that Soap got his nickname not because he is fastidious in the shower, but because he is good at &quot;cleaning house&quot;. In fact, this is something he does with &quot;remarkable speed and accuracy in room clearance techniques and urban warfare tactics&quot;.

                              <span>UPDATE 3pm UK time: Activision Blizzard exec Lulu Cheng Meservey has hit back at yesterday&#x27;s report which suggested the FTC will &quot;fight&quot; to challenge Microsoft&#x27;s deal.


Making a statement on Twitter, Meservey said any notion the deal would be anticompetitive is &quot;absurd&quot; and that the &quot;merger will benefit gamers and the US gaming industry - especially as we face stiffer competition from abroad&quot;.


This could be referring to moves made by Sweden&#x27;s Embracer Group and China&#x27;s Tencent to acquire more studios and IPs.

                              <span>Sony has dunked on EA&#x27;s Battlefield series in its arguments against Microsoft&#x27;s buyout of Activision Blizzard.


In documents released as part of the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority review into the potential merger, Sony argues that Call of Duty &quot;is not replicable&quot; and that other games cannot compete with its success.



It then calls out the Battlefield series as a major rival, but says the franchise &quot;cannot keep up&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed Pokémon Violet and Scarlet sold over 10m copies in their first three days of release, making it the company&#x27;s biggest ever launch in that time period.


Pokémon Violet and Scarlet have faced significant criticism since release - Digital Foundry called the games &quot;comprehensive technical failures&quot; - but that hasn&#x27;t stopped them from smashing previous series entries&#x27; already considerable launch day records.


We already knew Violet and Scarlet were off to a flying start when charts firm GfK confirmed the pair were not only the UK&#x27;s biggest boxed video game launch of the year, but the UK&#x27;s second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time - only being beaten out by 3DS&#x27; Sun and Moon.

                              <span>Developer Striking Distance Studios has responded to the news its sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s season pass will feature exclusive death animations, insisting these haven&#x27;t been cut from the main game to sell for an additional fee.


As detailed on Steam, The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s season pass consists of four components: the Outer Way Skin Collection, story DLC, a Riot Bundle featuring a new wave-based mode set in an &quot;undiscovered area&quot; of Black Iron Prison, and a permadeath mode included in the Contagion Bundle. Eyebrows were raised, however, with the news the latter two bundles would also add a total of 25 new death animations - 13 for protagonist Jacob and 12 for enemies.


Much of The Callisto Protocol’s pre-release publicity has focused on its myriad gruesome death animations as a key selling point - Striking Distance&#x27;s CEO Glen Schofield discussed its &quot;gore engine&quot; with Eurogamer earlier this year - so there was a degree of incredulity when Striking Distance revealed more than two dozen of these would only be available to purchasers of the season pass, being sold as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition for an additional £20.

Splinter Cell&#x27;s audio adaptation - officially titled Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Firewall - follows series protagonist and Fourth Echelon agent Sam Fisher on a mission to recruit and train the next generation of operatives for the National Security Agency&#x27;s covert action division. &quot;When a lethal assassin from Fisher&#x27;s past returns from the dead on a mission of murder,&quot; the BBC teases, &quot;he is thrust into a race against time as a sinister threat to global security is revealed.&quot;


Firewall stars Andonis Anthony (The Archers) as Sam Fisher, and Daisy Head as his daughter Sarah. Other cast members include Sacha Dhawan (Doctor Who, The Great), Will Poulter (Midsommer, Black Mirror), and Nikesh Patel (Starstruck, The Devil&#x27;s Hour).

                              <span>CD Projekt&#x27;s long-promised next-gen update for The Witcher 3 is almost upon us, and ahead of its PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC arrival on 14th December, the studio has shared a first look at the various enhancements it&#x27;ll bring.


As far as technical improvements go, CD Projekt positively whistled through them during its first-look livestream, but PC players can expect to see support for the likes of raytracing, DLSS, and FSR, alongside a selection of new Ultra Plus graphics options, boosting background characters, level of detail, and more.


Indeed, there are visual touch-ups across the board, including a rework for grass and foliage, enhanced and more varied weather conditions, plus higher resolution textures and meshes throughout environments. Novigrad&#x27;s cobblestones are no longer normal maps, for instance, and instead now fully 3D. Keen-eyed players will also see the likes of smoke drifting from chimneys in distant villages.

The country&#x27;s top industry body made the announcement yesterday, Reuters reported, following the introduction of a draconian set of rules which restricted anyone in the country under the age of 18 from playing video games longer than three hours in any typical week.


This crackdown has achieved &quot;remarkable results&quot;, the China Game Industry Group Committee data provider CNG said, with more than 75 percent of all under-18s now claimed to be following the rules.

PlayStation Studios head Herman Hulst shared the news on Twitter, thanking fans and congratulating God of War Ragnarök developer Sony Santa Monica for its &quot;amazing achievement&quot;.


We already knew God of War Ragnarök was doing the numbers, of course - it set the day-one sales record for the franchise here in the UK - but Hulst&#x27;s announcement confirmed it had also set a first-week sales record for the series around the world. By way of comparison, Ragnarök&#x27;s immediate predecessor shifted 3.1m copies in its first three days back in 2018, beating out the previous record held by God of War 3 in 2010.

                              <span>Sony does not expect its next-generation PlayStation to arrive until at least 2027, a confidential document has suggested. 


The partially-redacted document was released publicly today as part of the UK&#x27;s ongoing in-depth Competition and Markets Authority review into Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68bn Activision Blizzard buyout - a deal Sony has strongly objected to. 


In an intriguing passage discussing the length of time Call of Duty may remain on PlayStation, Sony claims that (at the time of writing) it expected to lose access to the franchise in 2027. Sony then goes on to state that by the time it &quot;launched the next generation of its PlayStation console... it would have lost access to Call of Duty and other Activision titles&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft has admitted that Sony has more exclusive games that are &quot;better quality&quot; than its own.


The statement comes in documents pertaining to Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which have just been released.


In Microsoft&#x27;s response to the CMA&#x27;s Issues Statement, it claims the proposed merger is pro-competitive due to Sony&#x27;s standing as the dominant platform holder.

                              <span>Nearly nine months on from launch, Gran Turismo 7 has introduced one of its most heavily requested features, as the game&#x27;s 1.26 update finally allows players to sell cars in their garage. 


The inability to sell vehicles was a key part of the criticisms aimed towards the PlayStation exclusive at launch, with a miserly economy and expensive microtransactions souring the experience for many. It&#x27;s a bit baffling that it&#x27;s taken so long, and there&#x27;s still a little uncertainty precisely how it&#x27;ll work and how good the payouts will be, but it does at least come as part of a generous update. 


The big addition that comes with the 1.26 patch is a track that&#x27;s entirely new to Gran Turismo, and is something a bit special. Road Atlanta&#x27;s a 2.5 mile circuit set in the north of the state of Georgia, and is one of the finest road courses in the USA. It plays host to the Petit Le Mans each year, a challenging race that makes the most of its undulations and whip-quick esses for one of the most punishing endurance races where 10 hours feels more like 100 (at least that&#x27;s what it felt like the few times I&#x27;ve run its iRacing virtual equivalent).

                              <span>An eye-catching Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl fan remaster will launch on 25th December.


Fans of the Ukranian first-person shooter survival horror series have reacted warmly to the news, while work continues on the game&#x27;s official follow-up.


The remaster will launch as a free mod to the original game, creator Andrey0007 stated via ModDB, containing around 16GB of new textures. Plans to also edit the game&#x27;s plot in order to remove some inconsistencies have been scaled back, however.

                              <span>Notorious hacker George &quot;Geohot&quot; Hotz has been hired by Elon Musk to work on Twitter - primarily, to fix the flailing social network&#x27;s search functionality.


Hotz shot to internet fame in 2008 for being the first to jailbreak the iPhone. Around a year later, he followed that feat by hacking the PlayStation 3 - and memorably rapped about Sony&#x27;s subsequent attempts to sue him. The two sides ultimately settled matters outside of court.


Now, Hotz has agreed to join Musk at Twitter on a temporary work contract (something which seems wise).

Listings for project directors, a lead engineer, and a live service analyst at Netflix Games Studio were spotted earlier today (thanks, Mobilegamer.biz).

Speaking to Kinda Funny Games on their God of War Ragnarök spoilercast, director Eric Williams was asked whether DLC is on the way.



&quot;I don&#x27;t know, man, that game is big,&quot; said Williams said. &quot;I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn&#x27;t count on it.&quot;

The game is set for release on 2nd December across PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC, but 13 minutes of footage has been shared on YouTube.


Of course, it&#x27;s low quality off-screen footage but it still details the title screen, settings, and the beginning of the story.

Future Tech is the ninth content update for Prison Architect, and gives players the ability to update their prisons with high-tech features and more advanced security.


Its big additions include keycard-activated doors, controllable searchlights, and even two robot guard dogs, but players can also make use of glass walls, electrified fences, and a tracking belt - enabling them to follow inmates via the tracking menu, monitors, and routers.

                              <span>Like a Santa descending from the heavens on a reindeer made of space, Hello Games has delved into its sack of procedural treats to give good No Man&#x27;s Sky fans one final gift for 2022: another chance to play all four of this year&#x27;s Expeditions and snag any goodies they might have missed the first time around.


Expeditions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, are something like No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim&#x27;s various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And the rewards for completing each one are usually pretty neat, ranging from robot dog companions to your very own space whale.


And now Hello Games has confirmed it&#x27;ll be re-running all four of 2022&#x27;s Expedition starting this Thursday, 24th November. As was the case in last year&#x27;s redux event, Expeditions will run in truncated form, each lasting for just two weeks before the next one rolls in - meaning players eager to acquire any rewards they might have missed (including those on Switch, who haven&#x27;t had chance to play any of these yet) will have to work quick.

Arika&#x27;s The Grand Master series first appeared in Japanese arcades back in 1988, where it quickly gained a reputation for its difficulty, thanks to the rapid drop speed increase during play. It also features a grading system, ranking performance all the way up to Grand Master.


Several sequels followed, and the series eventually made the jump to home consoles in Japan with 2005&#x27;s Tetris: The Grand Master Ace for Xbox 360 - which was to be its final release.

Dreamlight Valley players first got a look at the life-sim adventure&#x27;s new Toy Story realm - a recreation of Andy&#x27;s childhood bedroom, as seen in the movies - back in September, during the Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase.


At the time, it was revealed players would be teaming up with Woody and Buzz for a &quot;brand-new Toy Story adventure&quot; when the realm released. A selection of Buzz and Woody inspired cosmetics were also teased, but full details of the update are still to be shared.

                              <span>To celebrate the arrival of Civilization 6&#x27;s Leader Pass on PC, Mac, and iOS, developer Firaxis has provided a more detailed breakdown of Abraham Lincoln, Queen Nzinga Mbande, and Sultan Saladin - the first of 18 leaders being introduced across six included DLC.


First up in the Leader Pass&#x27; inaugural DLC, known as the Great Negotiations Pack, is Abraham Lincoln, representing the United States. Lincoln abides by the Preserver of the Union agenda - meaning he only likes civilisations with the same form of government - and makes use of his Emancipation Proclamation ability, which has a number of different effects depending on the expansions players have installed.


Those with just the base game get +2 Amenities for Industrial Zones and their buildings, but receive -1 Amenities for Plantations. These numbers increase to +3 Amenities per turn and -2 Loyalty respectively when using the Rise and Fall &amp; Gathering Storm DLCs.

                              <span>The hunt for the elusive 1-in-4096 shiny Pokémon is a little bit easier in Scarlet and Violet right now, thanks to some exploits discovered by the community.
You don&#x27;t need to have progressed that far into the game to make these work, though you&#x27;ll probably want a relatively high-level Pokémon to do some bidding for you.
I briefly tested the two methods currently making the rounds in the community, and whilst one worked for me, the other didn&#x27;t. So be wary, your mileage may vary.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today decided to launch an in-depth investigation into Apple and Google, looking at the restrictions set by each company that affect access to smartphone cloud gaming.


The move follows an earlier proposal to investigate the two companies&#x27; market power, and a year-long study of the iPhone and Android ecosystems. That report, published in June, determined Apple and Google held &quot;an effective duopoly&quot; over smartphone markets, allowing them to &quot;exercise a stranglehold&quot; over mobile operating systems, app stores and web browsers.


Further work by the CMA included consultations with unnamed &quot;cloud gaming service providers&quot;, as well as web developers and browser makers, who said Apple and Google&#x27;s approach was &quot;harming their businesses, holding back innovation, and adding unnecessary costs&quot;. These concerns will be investigated further as part of a far-reaching &quot;Phase 2&quot; CMA investigation.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;re still buzzing from the reveal that we will all soon be playing Maple Treeway in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in just a couple of weeks. 


Also, if you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ll have rewatched yesterday&#x27;s Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC Wave 3 trailer multiple times, trying to spot all the tweaks and additions to some of the many returning tracks. (And yes, that does sound like a newly-recorded version of Maple Treeway&#x27;s score.)


Alongside yesterday&#x27;s trailer I saw a generally warmer reception to the visuals in these latest additions than in some of the other DLC drops so far - which have been criticised by fans as not standing up to graphical quality seen in the base game. These DLC tracks are, by and large, taken from Mario Kart Tour - the series&#x27; smartphone spin-off - with an extra layer of polish attached.

Mistlands adds new creatures, enemies, weapons and crafting materials, and is available to try today via Valheim&#x27;s latest test build, available from both Steam and the Microsoft Store.


A fresh trailer shows some of the Mistlands&#x27; fresh friends and foes, some of its new areas, and magic system -  including magical staves.

The intended sequence of the game would see you play through The First Day of School quest, which would then unlock all the other storylines in the game.
However, players have found a way to skip the latter section of the quest, allowing you to cut out the tedium of meeting your new classmates and teachers and get straight into exploring the open-world of Paldea.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s World Cup is a little different, as I think we all understand. Amidst headlines on migrant worker conditions, LGBTQ+ rights and criticism of the tournament from both players and fans, it&#x27;s been interesting to see how brands - and video games - are noting Qatar 2022.


Fortnite has a history with football - and its governing bodies. Some of its most popular skins are based on football kit designs, and the game&#x27;s meme-like dances were a fixture of England&#x27;s 2018 World Cup squad. Last year, Epic Games officially licensed the likenesses of England&#x27;s Harry Kane and Germany&#x27;s Marco Reus for the delayed 2020 Euros, and featured an in-game &quot;UEFA Euro 2020 Cup&quot; tournament with cash prizes. 


Prior to that, Fortnite has added skins wearing the officially-licensed football shirts of 23 top teams worldwide, including many from the Premiership. Fortnite also has an officially licensed Neymar Jr. skin, and an emote where you can punch the air that was launched in a collaboration with Pelé.

To put this figure into perspective, Warzone 1 reached 30 million players in 10 days. If Warzone 2 keeps up the same momentum, it is safe to assume it will soon exceed these figures.


Activision shared the news of this milestone on its social media feeds, thanking those who have taken part in its frenzied battlegrounds so far.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to the days of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and you may recall an infamous bug that allowed players to soar through the skies in a fashion that should not be not humanly possible. This became known as the &#x27;Superman&#x27; exploit, due to the way the players looked when this glitch was in motion - positioned horizontally in a skydiving position.


And now, when playing Call of Duty&#x27;s most recent offerings of Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, you may well see this move in play once more. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it&#x27;s just your teammate channelling their inner Clark Kent. 


Today&#x27;s version of the Superman exploit was recently shared by prolific Warzone 2 player Wuqi. In a compilation, the gamer can be seen bouncing off certain points on the maps while diving in the air, giving them a soaring boost. This, as you can see below, allows them to cover ground a lot more quickly than the more traditional methods of traversal.

                              <span>The golf update for Nintendo Switch Sports will be released at the end of this month. 

Originally planned for autumn, the update was delayed in September for more development time, with a release window of the holiday season.

So far, Nintendo has stated the update will support local and online play. 21 holes from Wii Sports will be included. Online play will support up to eight players in survival golf, where the player with the most strokes will be knocked out.

                              <span>The publisher of role-playing game Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana is currently investigating why the game has been removed from Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue without warning. 


Sony&#x27;s subscription service offered the PS4 version of Ys 8, alongside other titles in the series. Last week, a £35 PS5 version of the game launched, with no free upgrade option for fans with a PS4 copy already. 


It was around this time that the RPG&#x27;s PS4 version disappeared from the PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue.

On Twitter, security researchers Tommy Mysk and Talal Haj Bakry have found that Apple’s device analytics data includes an iCloud account and can be linked directly to a specific user, including their name, date of birth, email, and associated information stored on iCloud.

Apple has long claimed otherwise:
On Apple’s device analytics and privacy legal page, the company says no information collected from a device for analytics purposes is traceable back to a specific user. “iPhone Analytics may include details about hardware and operating system specifications, performance statistics, and data about how you use your devices and applications. None of the collected information identifies you personally,” the company claims...</span>

                              <span>18 months after Ubisoft announced plans to bring crossplay and cross-progression to Rainbow Six Siege, their long-awaited console launch is finally almost here, with a release now set for 6th December as part of Year 7&#x27;s final season, Operation Solar Raid.


Crossplay and cross-progression have, of course, been available in Rainbow Six Siege for some time now, but only between PC, Stadia, and Luna. As of next month, though, that&#x27;ll open out to incorporate PlayStation and Xbox, so console owners can take advantage of the features too.


From 6th December, console players can access their progress, currencies, and other items across all platforms simply by logging into their accounts. They can also team up with friends on other consoles via Ubisoft Connect, although it&#x27;s possible to opt out of crossplay if preferred.

                              <span>Following the launch of MultiVersus&#x27; second season last week, the free-to-play fighter&#x27;s roster has now expanded once more, this time ushering in Looney Tunes&#x27; extraterrestrial extraordinaire Marvin the Martian.


Marvin&#x27;s imminent arrival was teased last week as Season 2 got underway, but he officially joins the line-up today, bringing Multiversus&#x27; total number of playable fighters up to 23 - with Marvin joining recent additions such as Black Adam and Gremlins&#x27; Gizmo and Stripe.


Marvin can be unlocked with 3000 Gold, 1 Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium, and features three signature moves. There&#x27;s his B-23 Bubble Blaster, giving players the power to launch bubble projectiles, and that&#x27;s joined by his K-62 Projectile Modulator - basically a big red button that will reverse the direction of allied projectiles. Finally, Marvin can plant his flag into the ground, simultaneously claiming it for Mars and sending enemies skyward.

                              <span>As intense government scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard continues, with many regulatory bodies placing particular importance on the future of the Call of Duty franchise, Microsoft has told the New York Times it offered Sony a 10-year deal to keep the series on PlayStation earlier this month.


In total, 16 regulatory bodies around the world have launched investigations into Microsoft&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard to assess its likely impact on competition. So far, only Brazil and Saudi Arabia have approved the deal, with a number of territories, including the European Commission and the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, having announced more in-depth reviews of the matter.


In both those cases, Call of Duty&#x27;s future has been highlighted as a particular concern, with regulators raising fears the juggernaut franchise may be leveraged by Microsoft to gain an unfair advantage over its competition.

                              <span>EA has delayed its promised fix for excessive autonomous meanness in The Sims 4, meaning players are now going to have to put up with their Sims spontaneously picking fights and ruining each others lives until early December.


All this started back in October when, following a patch update, The Sims 4 players began reporting their Sims were autonomously insulting friends, relatives, and passersby at an alarming frequency, causing havoc to their carefully curated stories.


Eventually, with insults continuing to fly and households lying in ruin, EA moved to acknowledge the issue, promising a fix would arrive as soon as its investigation was complete.

                              <span>Ubisoft blockbuster Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will launch via Steam, its publisher has confirmed to Eurogamer today. 


Valhalla will be joined by other Ubisoft titles such as city-building strategy Anno 1800 and free-to-play 3v3 sports game Roller Champions.


The confirmation means Ubisoft is the latest publisher to make its return to Steam after striking out on its own - or elsewhere, such as the rival Epic Games Store.

                              <span>Footage of a prototype for Wumpa League, the long-rumoured multiplayer brawler set in the Crash Bandicoot universe, has been leaked online.

Rumours of the game&#x27;s existence began in summer, when it was accidentally let slip by Windows Central. Speculation on a new Crash Bandicoot game increased when Toys for Bob teased their 18th game, and fans are expecting to see a new entry in the series announced at The Game Awards next month.

The prototype was leaked yesterday by YouTuber Liam Robertson, for reasons he described as &quot;historical interest&quot;. A short snippet of gameplay is shown along with concept arts. Robertson reiterated throughout the video that the footage shown comes from a very early version of the project, and that it is &quot;not representative of what the game could look like if it releases&quot;.

It turns out if you connect two sets of Joy-Con to your Switch, your character will run at double speed when using both left sticks.


The strategy was shared over on reddit with a video of the results.

                              <span>A former intern at Sony Santa Monica has said that their work on God of War Ragnarök had gone uncredited.


Sharing her story on Twitter, composer Jessica Mao stated she &quot;worked on the editing/arrangement/implementation of the Freya chase scene&quot; as well as the &quot;Thor boss fight music&quot;.


However, despite her input, Mao said her name was not included in the game&#x27;s end credits as her contribution to Ragnarök didn&#x27;t hit the &quot;minimum criteria&quot;  required (although Mao is unsure what &quot;this criteria could be&quot;).

The top-tier Rainbow Road from Mario Kart DS is another notable addition here, alongside that game&#x27;s popular Peach Gardens.

Attendees will also have access to mysterious &quot;special Pokémon encounters&quot; in the wild and earn a commemorative in-game badge, all before the Ultra Beasts themselves emerge between 6pm and 7.30pm.

From tomorrow (22nd November), Fall Guys fans will be presented with five new rounds to get to grips with. These are Blastlantis, Hoop Chute, Puzzle Path, Speed Slider and Kraken Slam.


Blastlantis will task your anatomic beans with navigating a variety of &quot;tilting pathways&quot;. This will be made even harder thanks to the Blast Balls that will be, erm, blasted at them as they try to negotiate the path in front of them.

                              <span>This weekend&#x27;s big releases were Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and the internet has done a lot of talking about them. For reasons.
The game&#x27;s current state is far from perfect, leading to plenty of glitches, jankiness and sometimes full on Bethesda-level comedy horror.
Personally, I picked up the game precisely for that experience (I am having fun playing the game also!) but sadly I&#x27;ve not encountered anything funkier than a T-pose during my time with Violet so far. Luckily for me, there are countless other people who&#x27;ve been sharing their witness accounts on Twitter.

                              <span>Since its release just shy of two weeks ago, there has been a lot of chatter about God of War Ragnarök. This has ranged from whether or not there should be a PETA friendly mode included in the game, to Kratos&#x27; atonement for his past behaviour.


One thing that has really struck a chord is the amount of help Ragnarök&#x27;s companions give when players are trying to solve puzzles. Many fans feel that, really, it would be better if said companions just held on to their advice for that little bit longer than they ultimately choose to. 


For example, much like many others, I like to venture off the game&#x27;s main path every so often to see if there are any treasures tucked away I could miss if I left the area too soon. (This is all just standard exploration, not a sign that I don&#x27;t have a clue what I am doing. Honestly, it is.) Early on in the game I took one step away from Atreus and was swiftly told I was going the wrong way. &quot;I think this wheel over here needs to turn,&quot; he called after my retreating footsteps.

In response to fans expressing displeasure with the ending to the latest game, Kamiya notes it wasn&#x27;t conveyed &quot;correctly&quot; and that Bayonetta 4 will be an unexpected development.


&quot;I didn&#x27;t think it was unexpected at all, but it seems that the ending of Bayo 3 wasn&#x27;t conveyed correctly to everyone, so I think Bayo 4 will be an unexpected development for everyone,&quot; Kamiya said via Twitter. &quot;After all, when Bayo 4 comes out, I&#x27;m sure there will be people who say, &#x27;You added that as an afterthought&#x27;, so I&#x27;ll say it now.&quot;

                              <span>Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon has teased a return for some of the series&#x27; 3D-era characters in the future, following previous hints at the under-wraps Mortal Kombat 12 being in development. 


Boon, who loves to tease fans via Twitter, wrote over the weekend that his next game would either be &quot;I3 or MK12&quot; - Injustice 3 or Mortal Kombat 12.


Responding to a fan who asked why so few characters from the franchise&#x27;s less-popular 3D-era are seen in recent games, Boon stated: &quot;That is something we will soon fix.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has issued copyright strikes against SteamGridDB for images relating to its Switch games.



The site allows users to upload custom images for use in their Steam library. Most of these are alternate cover images to customise a game&#x27;s appearance in the library, but it&#x27;s also used when a cover image doesn&#x27;t exist - typically when playing games through an emulator.


This is why Switch game images have appeared on the site, which has since received a DMCA takedown notice, Games Radar reported.

                              <span>The all-digital Xbox Series S is currently the best console deal in the UK thanks to Black Friday deals. 
As spotted by our pals over at Digital Foundry, both Amazon and Smyths are selling the Series S for £189.99, nearly a quarter off its usual price of £249.99.
Compared to current-gen consoles and Nintendo Switch, that&#x27;s quite a steal.

                              <span>Impressive physical sales in the UK have made Pokémon Scarlet and Violet the biggest boxed video game launch of the year. Previously, this accolade was held by FIFA 23.


This has also won Scarlet and Violet the title of being the UK&#x27;s second biggest boxed Pokémon launch of all time. The biggest is still that of the 3DS&#x27;s Sun and Moon (although, due to sale prices, charts firm GfK states Scarlet and Violet has generated more money than Sun and Moon did during its launch week). 


Per GamesIndustry.biz, the first week of sales for Scarlet and Violet (at least physically, as Nintendo does not share digital sales) are 25 percent bigger than those of Sword and Shield, 70 percent bigger than the Diamond and Pearl remakes and 56 percent bigger than this year&#x27;s other big Pokémon offering, Arceus.

                              <span>Sony and Honda are joining forces on new electric vehicles that could incorporate PlayStation 5 consoles.


Sony Honda Mobility was established in September and plans to build electric vehicles with entertainment like music, movies, and the PlayStation 5 in mind.


&quot;Sony has content, services and entertainment technologies that move people. We are adapting these assets to mobility, and this is our strength against Tesla,&quot; president Izumi Kawanishi told the Financial Times (thanks TheGamer).

                              <span>Brian Krebs writes about how the Zeppelin ransomware encryption scheme was broken:
The researchers said their break came when they understood that while Zeppelin used three different types of encryption keys to encrypt files, they could undo the whole scheme by factoring or computing just one of them: An ephemeral RSA-512 public key that is randomly generated on each machine it infects.
“If we can recover the RSA-512 Public Key from the registry, we can crack it and get the 256-bit AES Key that encrypts the files!” they wrote. “The challenge was that they delete the [public key] once the files are fully encrypted. Memory analysis gave us about a 5-minute window after files were encrypted to retrieve this public key.”...</span>

                              <span>Numskull Designs has unveiled a new range of Space Invaders miniature arcade cabinets.

Citing Space Invaders&#x27; upcoming 45th anniversary next year, Numskull has released two new quarter-scale cabinets to celebrate: Space Invaders and Space Invaders Part 2.

&quot;Space Invaders originally issued in the golden era of arcade gaming and set the bar for those that followed,&quot; the company said. &quot;Since its release in 1978 it has gone on to become a global pop-culture phenomenon. Developed by Tomohiro Nishikado, the game has been cited as revolutionising the arcade industry as well as having an influence on many famous video game designs since.

                              <span>Blizzard has begun deploying audio transcription to help combat abuse and toxicity in Overwatch 2&#x27;s voice chat.

Rolling out across &quot;select countries&quot; and currently only for those playing on PC, Blizzard says the new tech is &quot;only for reports of disruptive behaviour&quot; and any &quot;temporary audio recordings&quot; - which &quot;no one listens to&quot; - will be &quot;quickly deleted after being transcribed&quot;.

&quot;The audio transcription feature has been added with a limited rollout for PC players in select countries,&quot; Blizzard explained via a blog post. &quot;As a piece of our Defense Matrix initiative, audio transcriptions allow us to analyse a transcript from a temporary voice chat recording of a reported player.

Korean website Ruliweb reports that Fumihiko Yasuda confirmed plans to resurrect the two dormant franchises at a panel at the G-Star Conference earlier this week (thanks, VGC).

Whilst Yasuda stopped short of giving any concrete details, he reportedly said that whilst he couldn&#x27;t tell us any more right now, he hopes to deliver news we&#x27;d like to see &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.

                              <span>A new Warzone 2.0 bug is seemingly making some players invisible.

This latest glitch - which some may remember also briefly caused havoc in the original Warzone game - came to light over the weekend after players took to Reddit and social media with clips of them being taken out by players they cannot see. Literally.

Whilst its unknown how widespread the issue is, videos posted to social media show plenty have been on the receiving end of the frustrating glitch and it&#x27;s currently unclear if it&#x27;s just a random occurrence or something sneaky players can turn on and off at will (thanks, PCGN).

                              <span>A new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet mod removes all traces of Ed Sheeran from the game.

As spotted by GamesRadar+, the newly released mod - simply called &quot;Remove Sheeran&quot; - does exactly what it says on the tin, deleting Sheeran&#x27;s tracks from the credits and replacing it with a track from the late notable Japanese singer, Wada Koji.

&quot;Removes Ed Sheeran from the game and replaces him with Wada Koji (may he rest in peace),&quot; explains the mod&#x27;s creator, before adding that as they only own Violet, the mod has yet to be tested on Scarlet. It should still work, though.

                              <span>Warzone 2.0 players have discovered a bug that&#x27;s reportedly locking them out of the free-to-play game unless they own Modern Warfare 2.

Whilst the issue was posted on the game&#x27;s subreddit community earlier this week and seems to have been resolved for some, others are still adding to - and upvoting - the post, suggesting that it&#x27;s yet to be resolved. At the time of writing, there&#x27;s been no formal word from Infinity Ward or Raven Software, either.

&quot;Since yesterday, I played probably around six Warzone 2.0 matches with no problem,&quot; commented u/Unf0cused (thanks, NME).

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls Online: Firesong DLC is finally here for console players. 

Whilst arriving a little later than its PC sibling, this new story DLC allows players to explore the &quot;untamed island of Galen, the westernmost island of the Systres Archipelago&quot; where players can &quot;dive deep into the lives and culture of the druids, and fight to defend Tamriel from the threats within&quot;. 

&quot;In The Elder Scrolls Online: Firesong, players will finally confront the Ascendant Lord and conclude their Legacy of the Bretons yearlong adventure,&quot; the team teases.

                              <span>Striking Distance and publisher Krafton have unveiled a new teaser for its upcoming horror, The Callisto Protocol.

Imaginatively entitled &quot;official launch trailer UK&quot;, it packs a lot of action into just under two minutes of footage, most of which we&#x27;ve seen before, but some that will be new to those who have been tracking the game&#x27;s development. You can watch every slimy, gory second of it below:

The trailer also features the exclusive song Lost Again by Kings Elliot and confirms that the penultimate episode of the game&#x27;s six-part audio series, The Callisto Protocol: Helix Station, is also now available, along with the final part of the Engineering Horror docuseries, too.

&quot;Today, players can experience an extended look, offering even more detail on the decisions they will be called to make as they lead their forces throughout the course of World War 1, in a conflict which will force them to fight for every inch as they seek to relive history, or redefine it,&quot; the development team tells us.

As highlighted by u/AHappyPandaBear - and upvoted hundreds of times - players point out that although Apex Legends and PUBG Battlegrounds permit players to return mid-game following crashes or internet issues, Warzone does not, making it &quot;a massive L&quot; for the community.

The issue is particularly troublesome for DMZ players, who say they are losing &quot;so much&quot; loot and contraband without the chance to rejoin the session.

According to Google Translate, Tears of the Kingdom has been described as a &quot;role-playing game for Nintendo Switch in which the stage of the adventure to find Zelda expands into the sky&quot;.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will not be getting a New Game+ mode, even though it&#x27;s a &quot;highly requested feature&quot;.

Whilst developer Ubisoft acknowledged that the &quot;news will come as a disappointment&quot; to some players, because of Valhalla&#x27;s &quot;very different structure from its predecessors&quot;, the open-world Viking game will be the first Assassin&#x27;s Creed game not to feature an option to boot up a New Game+ run.

&quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla has been built as a unique Assassin’s Creed experience, one that is very different from its predecessors in its structure, offering new ways of engaging with the world and its characters,&quot; Ubisoft explained in a blog post (thanks, GamesRadar+).

                              <span>Knockout City&#x27;s eighth season, High Society Heist, is slated for release on 29th November, 2022.

Running until 5th December, High Society Heist heralds new content, including new Poison Special Ball, new cosmetic type &quot;Brags&quot;, and yes, more Teenage Mutant Ninja/Hero Turtles stuff, including TMNT Villains Behop and Rocksteady amongst new Player icons, those aforementioned Brags, and custom intro poses, too.

&quot;In High Society Heist, the Red Hand Crew is stirring up trouble in Knockout City, and Commissioner Chase is on the case,&quot; explains the accompanying blurb. &quot;The notorious Red Hand Crew – Voxanne, Mugshot, Hax and The Shadow – are chasing their latest heist and zeroing in on their newest target: the multi-millionaire Malcolm Magpie. Players can decide which side they want to be on – become one of the craftiest criminals around as a member of the Red Hand Crew or crack the case as Commissioner Chase.

                              <span>Researchers have new evidence of how squid brains develop:
Researchers from the FAS Center for Systems Biology describe how they used a new live-imaging technique to watch neurons being created in the embryo in almost real-time. They were then able to track those cells through the development of the nervous system in the retina. What they saw surprised them.
The neural stem cells they tracked behaved eerily similar to the way these cells behave in vertebrates during the development of their nervous system.
It suggests that vertebrates and cephalopods, despite diverging from each other 500 million years ago, not only are using similar mechanisms to make their big brains but that this process and the way the cells act, divide, and are shaped may essentially layout the blueprint required develop this kind of nervous system...</span>

                              <span>Kirkus reviews A Hacker’s Mind:
A cybersecurity expert examines how the powerful game whatever system is put before them, leaving it to others to cover the cost.
Schneier, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and author of such books as Data and Goliath and Click Here To Kill Everybody, regularly challenges his students to write down the first 100 digits of pi, a nearly impossible task­—but not if they cheat, concerning which he admonishes, “Don’t get caught.” Not getting caught is the aim of the hackers who exploit the vulnerabilities of systems of all kinds. Consider right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who located a hack in the tax code: “Because he was one of the founders of PayPal, he was able to use a $2,000 investment to buy 1.7 million shares of the company at $0.001 per share, turning it into $5 billion—all forever tax free.” It was perfectly legal—and even if it weren’t, the wealthy usually go unpunished. The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator, reveals how the tax code lends itself to hacking, as when tech companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions of dollars by transferring profits out of the U.S. to corporate-friendly nations such as Ireland, then offshoring the “disappeared” dollars to Bermuda, the Caymans, and other havens. Every system contains trap doors that can be breached to advantage. For example, Schneier cites “the Pudding Guy,” who hacked an airline miles program by buying low-cost pudding cups in a promotion that, for $3,150, netted him 1.2 million miles and “lifetime Gold frequent flier status.” Since it was all within the letter if not the spirit of the offer, “the company paid up.” The companies often do, because they’re gaming systems themselves. “Any rule can be hacked,” notes the author, be it a religious dietary restriction or a legislative procedure. With technology, “we can hack more, faster, better,” requiring diligent monitoring and a demand that everyone play by rules that have been hardened against tampering...</span>

On Tuesday, researchers published findings that, for the first time, break TTE’s isolation guarantees. The result is PCspooF, an attack that allows a single non-critical device connected to a single plane to disrupt synchronization and communication between TTE devices on all planes. The attack works by exploiting a vulnerability in the TTE protocol. The work was completed by researchers at the University of Michigan, the University of Pennsylvania, and NASA’s Johnson Space Center...</span>

                              <span>Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create Corp has revealed a court has ruled in its favour following a legal tussle with the publisher of Cooking Mama: Cookstar.


Cookstar has been embroiled in trouble ever since its release on Switch in March 2020, which saw it quickly disappear from Nintendo&#x27;s eShop and physical stores - a move later revealed to be due to a licensing dispute between Office Create and publisher Planet Entertainment.


Office Create claimed Planet Entertainment had refused to correct what it saw as a &quot;wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality and content of the game&quot; during development, despite being contractually obligated to do so, and had instead proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without Office Create&#x27;s approval.

                              <span>Immortality, the acclaimed investigative Hollywood mystery from Her Story developer Sam Barlow, is now available on iOS and Android via Netflix.


Immortality tells the story of Marissa Marcel, a (fictional) actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.


It&#x27;s up to players to find out what happened to Marcel, which, as in Barlow&#x27;s previous games, involves slowly piecing together events by scouring through reams of FMV video. But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose &quot;hacked&quot; webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage, using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; tides are a-turning once more, and next week&#x27;s Season 8 promises to be a bonanza for battle-hardened pirates, delivering an impressively exhaustive new &quot;PvP on demand&quot; system that, among other things, will see ships diving beneath the waves.


Core to Season 8 is a new faction system, enabling players to sign up to either the Pirate Lord&#x27;s Guardians of Fortune or Flameheart&#x27;s Servants of the Flame using the new Hourglass of Fate found on the Captain&#x27;s Table of every ship.


Once active, players can either represent their faction simply by taking on any opposing crews they spot in the world, or they can use the war map to immediately begin matchmaking to find an equally skilled opposing crew. It&#x27;s even possible to fight crews larger than your own if you&#x27;re feeling particularly confident in your PvP abilities.

But YouTuber ThatFriendlyGuy has taken things to a whole new level. 


Describing himself as an Escape from Tarkov Pacifist player, ThatFriendlyGuy decided to take on a new challenge. With the release of Modern Warfare 2, the YouTuber wanted to reach the max level of 55 without a single kill.

Among the many other major changes made to gameplay in Modern Warfare 2, audio design also got a major overhaul, and many players weren&#x27;t happy. 


In the beta, footsteps were incredibly loud, sometimes overwhelmingly so, that was it was hard to hear anything else.

                              <span>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Nvidia over a component in its RTX 4090 cards which has been melting for some owners.
The part in questions is believed to be the 12VVHPWR power adadpters, which Nvidia claims it is still investigating the issue, nearly a month after the first cases of melting power adapters were reported by owners.
The lawsuit was filed on 11th November by Lucas Genova to the US District Court for the Northern District of California. It has been filed under &quot;other fraud&quot;, which is defined as &quot;action primarily based on fraud relating to personal property that cannot be classified under any other nature of suit&quot; by the Administrative Office of the US Courts.

Please note, while this tribute is not integral to the main story, it does relate to one of the game&#x27;s &#x27;Favour&#x27; side-quests. If you are keen to avoid any spoilers, please refrain from reading further.


As players make their way around God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s realms, they may notice love hearts adorning the environments. These hearts are connected to the Across the Realms side-quest.

                              <span>Can you still P freely? Not if you want to use this specific P, which this week has been trademarked by Microsoft. 


The trademark listing, spotted by Aggiornamenti Lumia, describes Microsoft&#x27;s P as &quot;a geometric design in the shape of an uppercase &#x27;P&#x27; in gradient shades from green to blue&quot;.


Why does Microsoft want this P in particular? Well, it&#x27;s set to be used for computer software of some kind - the trademark itself covers various uses, including programs for &quot;visualising, animating, transforming, presenting and sharing data and other information&quot; as well as &quot;software development tools for the creation of computer software applications and mobile software applications&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty Warzone 2.0&#x27;s proximity chat feature has led to some interesting interactions between players, but one has taken it to the next level. 


TikToker Ziccs has taken to roleplaying as an Uber driver, picking up players and driving them to a destination in Al Mazrah of their choosing (in return for in-game cash, of course). 

The result is rather hilarious, with Ziccs later encountering one of his passengers in the Gulag. Tragically, Ziccs had eliminated his former customer and apologised for it.

Yet unused graphics found in the data of DS game Super Princess Peach reveal that, at some point in development, goombas were given different emotions.


As shared in a tweet from Supper Mario Broth, several unused goomba designs have been discovered.

This post from Overwatch 2&#x27;s new executive producer acknowledges the team isn&#x27;t &quot;completely satisfied with how everything feels right now,&quot; with Blizzard now looking at the &quot;[opportunities] for improvement that [it needs] to focus on&quot;.


Many of these future improvements will address issues with queue times, with Blizzard currently looking at ways to change the game&#x27;s approach to its Support heroes as a way to remedy the long waits many players have experienced.

The game&#x27;s ratings can be found by using the search term &quot;英雄連隊&quot;, the title&#x27;s translation into Chinese. The ratings for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S were all listed today (spotted by Gematsu).

As reported by TheGamer, the animal rights non-profit organisation has asked the developer for a &quot;PETA mode&quot; so Kratos can spare the lives of animals he meets on his journey across the nine realms.

                              <span>Yuji Naka, known as the father of Sonic the Hedgehog, has reportedly been arrested in Japan on suspicion of insider trading. 


The news was reported this morning by Japanese newspaper Mainichi, and comes a day after two other men were reported to have been charged with insider trading connected to Final Fantasy publisher Square Enix. Naka, you  may recall, worked with the company for a brief stint, creating platformer Balan Wonderworld. 


Naka, 57, is accused of purchasing shares worth 2.8m yen (around £16.8k) in Aiming, a Japanese developer which Square Enix partnered with to make a Dragon Quest mobile game, before the company&#x27;s involvement was public knowledge.

Back in September, the first teaser trailer showed Sonic racing against Shadow in the Green Hill Zone.


Now, though, it seems Sonic will be travelling across a shattered multiverse - check it out in the trailer below.

SMS Protect is a system first rolled out in Overwatch 2 that is designed to stop banned players from creating new accounts and continuing to play. It was later extended to Call of Duty.


The system was controversial at launch as players with prepaid phone numbers were unable to enroll. This disproportionately affected those on the lower end of the income scale who are unable to, or simply cannot afford a pay monthly phone contract.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been an eventful day for Gearbox; not only has the studio taken Saints Row developer Volition under its wing, it&#x27;s also announced the acquisition of Hopoo Games&#x27; co-operative rogue-like shooter Risk of Rain.


Hopoo Games&#x27; first stab at Risk of Rain released in 2013, delivering a breathless blast of 2D co-op action pitting players against an ever-more-relentless parade of enemies in an increasingly hilarious ballet of bullets and chaos.


Its acclaimed sequel, which took the whole thing into glorious 3D, released into Steam early access in 2019, and proved hugely popular, selling 3m copies before the year was through. It&#x27;s since got its full release on PC and consoles, and its most recent major update, the Survivors of the Void expansion, arrived in March this year.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve already swiped this week&#x27;s Epic Store freebies - Evil Dead: The Game and Dark Deity - and still remain unsated, you might want to pop next Thursday in your diary when something else shoots down the freebie pipe in the form of EA Motive&#x27;s Star Wars: Squadrons.


Star Wars: Squadrons is something of a spiritual successor to LucasArts&#x27; beloved X-Wing and TIE Fighter games. It&#x27;s set during the final days of the Galactic Empire, after the events of Return of the Jedi, and sees players engaging in deep space dogfights, both in multiplayer and in a bit of a solo campaign mode. There&#x27;s even VR support if you&#x27;re appropriately equipped.


Eurogamer enjoyed Star Wars: Squadrons when it released back in 2020, awarding it a Recommended badge and describing it as &quot;an immersive space sim that&#x27;s dazzling in VR [and] an exhilarating multiplayer experience, even if the story feels pedestrian.&quot;

                              <span>Crystal Dynamics has told fans it hears them &quot;loudly and clearly&quot; after a recent survey gauging their views on a potential Legacy of Kain revival received an overwhelmingly positive response.


Back in October, Crystal Dynamics launched a detailed questionnaire asking if the community would be interested in seeing the dark fantasy action-adventure series - which spanned five titles between 1996 and 2003 - make a comeback.


And the response, it turns out, was substantial. &quot;In the past, we&#x27;ve found that surveys typically get between 1,000 and 3,000 responses,&quot; Crystal Dynamics and Eidos CEO Phil Rogers explained during parent company Embracer Group’s latest earnings call (thanks CVG), &quot;but when we asked folk about Legacy of Kain, we received over 100,000 responses.&quot;

                              <span>Actor Scott Porter, who played Harry Osborn in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, has said he won&#x27;t be reprising the role in Insomniac Games&#x27; upcoming PlayStation 5 sequel.


Porter - who recently portrayed Heimdall in God of War: Ragnarok - was heard in audio logs but only rarely glimpsed as Osborn in the first Spider-Man. However, post-credits sequences found in that game and its Mile Morales follow-up appeared to be setting the character up as Venom in Insomniac&#x27;s &quot;darker&quot; Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2.


Given that Insomniac has already teased Venom as a major antagonist in next year&#x27;s sequel, it seemed a distinct possibility Porter would also be making a return, but the actor has confirmed otherwise in a now-deleted tweet.

                              <span>Today marks the 20th anniversary of Ubisoft&#x27;s much-loved (but distressingly absent) Splinter Cell series, and to mark the occasion the publisher has shared a smattering of concept art for its upcoming - but apparently still &quot;very early&quot; in development - remake.


All this comes via a special 20th anniversary developer roundtable video, culminating in a look at the future of the franchise. There&#x27;s a brief mention of the Netflix animated series - which was announced last June and still in the works despite radio silence since then - and, of course, mention of the eagerly anticipated Splinter Cell reboot.


Ubisoft announced its remake -  described as a ground-up remake - last December, with producer Matt West saying, &quot;We&#x27;re going to update it visually, as well as some of the design elements to match player comfort and expectations, and we are going to keep it linear like the original games, not make it open world.&quot;

Players have been experiencing a range of issues, from crashing clients to not being able to download the game at all. 


Activision Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.Net client disabled downloads yesterday evening across America and Europe.

                              <span>Actor John Leguizamo, who played Luigi in the 1993 adaptation of Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario franchise, has said he believes Illumination&#x27;s upcoming CGI film is &quot;backwards&quot; in its casting.


Speaking to IndieWire, Leguizamo recalled how his directors Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton &quot;fought really hard for [him] to be the lead because [he] was a Latin man&quot;.


The actor stated that the studio had not initially wanted him to be a lead, but the directors&#x27; push to cast him eventually worked - something Leguizamo called &quot;such a breakthrough&quot; for the industry.

The game was only beaten by the Valve behemoths Dota 2 and Counter-Strike Global Offensive, which are only distributed via Steam.

                              <span>It has, somehow, been a full year since Battlefield 2042 launched, and while it&#x27;d be premature to say DICE&#x27;s shooter has bounced back from a disastrous launch it&#x27;s certainly on firmer ground than it&#x27;s been for a while. The belated launch of Season One in June was a small step in the right direction, while August&#x27;s Season Two took bigger, bolder strides. Season Three, which kicks off on November 22nd, promises even more in the most radical season yet. 


What&#x27;s most promising is the influx of players that should come as Battlefield 2042 hits Game Pass and EA Play, hopefully ensuring once sparse servers are fully-populated. It&#x27;s part of a bigger push to get people playing Battlefield 2042, with free play periods for everyone across all platforms across December - on Xbox you can play for nada from December 1st-4th, on PC from December 1st-5th and on PlayStation from December 16th-23rd. 


Season Three - which has been dubbed Escalation - also makes some big changes, with the most profound being a return of sorts of the traditional class system to Battlefield, with specialists now being grouped by their roles. There&#x27;s a new specialist in the mix, too, with Rasheed Zain joining the fray. He&#x27;s a double-amputee whose traits include a faster health recharge and an airburst launcher.

Arkham City was first released in 2011, and has since been remastered for PS4 and Xbox One in the  Batman: Return to Arkham collection. Digital Foundry called this release a &quot;mixed bag&quot;, and stated they thought the original PC release was the &quot;definitive&quot; release.
But the PC version of Arkham City has not had a remastered edition - something which modder GPUnity set out to change.

Proximity chat allows players from different squads to talk to each other when they are close by. 


The result has been a barrage of clips capturing these conversations, some of which are predictable moments of trash talk, while others are surprisingly wholesome.

                              <span>A former employee of Final Fantasy publisher Square Enix has been arrested and accused of insider trading. 


38-year-old Taisuke Sazaki, whose video game credits include work on numerous Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts titles, allegedly bought shares in Japanese development company Aiming shortly before Square Enix publicly announced the studio was working on a new Dragon Quest mobile title.

Nippon reports that Sazaki acquired shares worth 20.8m yen (around £125k) between December 2019 and February 2020, after allegedly hearing details of Aiming&#x27;s project.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a little while since we heard about Sega&#x27;s plans to make a Streets of Rage movie, but the project now seems to be gathering pace. 


Hollywood production company Lionsgate has now taken up the project&#x27;s reigns, Deadline reported, following word earlier this year that Sonic the Hedgehog movie maker dj2 Entertainment was also involved.


More promising still is the news that Derek Kolstad, creator and lead writer of the hugely-lucrative John Wick franchise, remains attached, and will reportedly develop its script and act as a producer.

                              <span>Square Enix has revealed framerate and resolution details for its forthcoming remaster Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion.


As perhaps expected, the game will run with 4K resolution and 60fps on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, while on PC (Steam) the frame rate can be boosted to 120fps depending on specs.


However, Xbox Series S owners should note that a day one patch will be required in order to hit 60fps, otherwise it&#x27;ll be 30fps.

                              <span>Parts of Grand Theft Auto 5&#x27;s stolen source code have leaked online, and swiftly been removed via copyright strike by Rockstar.


The code in question is a string of scripting functions, as shared on reddit. It includes references to game elements like camera, graphics and cutscenes, as well as gangs and DLC. 


On its own, the leak isn&#x27;t particularly enlightening about the next game in the series, but Rockstar&#x27;s swift takedown proves the legitimacy of the recent leak.

The announcement by Embracer - the parent company of both studios - comes on the same day Volition finally released the &quot;Bright Future&quot; update for its beleagured Saints Row reboot, which belatedly fixes several hundred bugs present since the game&#x27;s launch back in August.


For fans who enjoyed Saints Row, Volition&#x27;s move places the future of that franchise in doubt.

                              <span>Call of Duty players have found an easy way to unlock the M13B Assault Rifle, which is  controversially locked behind a challenge that can only be completed in the new DMZ game mode.  


Even more controversial is the fact that extracting the weapon only unlocks it for the player who picked it up instead of the entire squad. This means your squad will have to make repeated trips back to unlock it for everyone. 


Fortunately, it appears you won&#x27;t have to after all. As you only need to extract with the gun at the end of a round, a squad mate can drop the weapon earned in a previous match for you to pick up. All you need to do now is extract safely and you unlock the weapon (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Rainbow Six Siege players have been looking under the hood of the game to try and understand the new anti-cheat update.
The update was rolled out by Ubisoft on 8th November, and on the game&#x27;s official website the developer listed the features included. The main feature was a new QB initiative  which has been in development for several months. &quot;While we cannot share details of the update in order to protect its integrity,&quot; Ubisoft wrote, &quot;we&#x27;re confident of the solution we&#x27;ve been able to put in place.&quot;
The QB feature was rolled back yesterday to allow Ubisoft to work on fixes for it. In the eight days the feature was live, players took a look at the files to try and understand how the measure worked.

                              <span>Konami&#x27;s eFootball begins Season 2 with The Football Festival.


It includes The International Cup Experience, in which players compete against AI as one of 46 available national teams, as well as the eFootball International Cup challenge event with a prize pool of 1bn eFootball coins.


This definitely isn&#x27;t the World Cup. Nope.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures Anthology&#x27;s first season will conclude tomorrow with Supermassive Games&#x27; The Devil in Me. 


As with previous entries in the series, the game concludes with a trailer for the series&#x27; next title - which has already been posted online. However, unlike previous entries to the series, the upcoming game - known as Directive 8020 - looks set to take players to space. 


Yes, this will be yet another game to add to the ever-growing space-horror genre which is having quite the renaissance of late (looking at you Callisto Protocol, Dead Space Remake and Fort Solis).

The medieval-em-up is definitely something of a unique experience and is the latest exclusive to hit the Xbox subscription service.


Speaking to Waypoint Radio, Sawyer said the game was only possible because Game Pass allows for unusual, niche games alongside blockbusters.

WOW, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm and the StarCraft series will become unplayable in China from 23rd January 2023, when NetEase&#x27;s current license expires. Diablo Immortal is unaffected.


This morning, NetEase president Simon Zhu - who says he&#x27;s spent &quot;10,000 hours&quot; playing the above games - reacted to the announcement in an extraordinary statement posted publicly via LinkedIn, where he blamed behind the scenes &quot;damage&quot; done by a &quot;jerk&quot; - who he left unnamed.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has hit another roadblock, albeit a comparatively small one in the grand scheme of things. 


The game will now release on 28th April, a 12 week delay from what was most recently announced. 


In a statement, the developer said this shift in release will give the team the extra time needed to provide a game everyone involved is &quot;proud to launch&quot;.

Not all users are having problems receiving SMS authentication codes, and those who rely on an authenticator app or physical authentication token to secure their Twitter account may not have reason to test the mechanism. But users have been self-reporting issues on Twitter since the weekend, and WIRED confirmed that on at least some accounts, authentication texts are hours delayed or not coming at all.

                              <span>Bethesda has responded to recent claims made by composer Mick Gordon, calling his lengthy account of mistreatment while working with id Software on the Doom Eternal soundtrack &quot;one-sided and unjust&quot; and a &quot;distortion of the truth&quot;.


Back in May 2020, Doom Eternal executive producer Marty Stratton took to Reddit to address &quot;speculation and criticism&quot; surrounding the the game&#x27;s soundtrack&#x27;s release, and admitting to &quot;eroded trust&quot; between Gordon and id Software.


Then, last week, Gordon took to Medium to share a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton&#x27;s claims, releasing screenshots of emails and legal documents as evidence of the true timeline of events. He went on to allege abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton.

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s November update is rolling out today, making a number of previously Insider-only features - including improved Discord support - available to all users.


Discord server voice chat support for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S initially launched in September, but was somewhat hampered by its convoluted mobile app requirements.


Today&#x27;s Xbox update streamlines the whole process, meaning users simply need to launch a Discord server via their console&#x27;s Parties &amp; chats &gt; Discord option then pick a voice channel from their available Discord servers - and as long their Discord and Xbox accounts are linked, they&#x27;ll be able to join that channel directly, no additional mobile app faff required.

                              <span>Riot Games and Ubisoft have announced a partnership that&#x27;ll see the companies collaborating on a research project with the aim of creating &quot;more positive gaming communities&quot;.


As explained in a blog post on Riot&#x27;s website, the project - which goes by the name Zero Harm in Comms - is the first step in a cross-industry initiative that&#x27;ll see the two companies working on a database to collect in-game data.


This anonymised data - consisting of chat logs labelled by behaviours, from neutral to racist and sexist - will be used to better train AI-based preemptive moderation tools, helping them more effectively recognise and parse, and so detect and mitigate, disruptive behaviour in-game.

                              <span>With preloads for Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 and DMZ now available, we can finally get a clearer view of the new interface to facilitate access between the different game modes, and it&#x27;s horrendous. 


Here&#x27;s how it works. The Modern Warfare 2 launcher will serve as the all-encompassing interface to access Modern Warfare 2, DMZ and Warzone 2.0. 


This is known as &quot;Call of Duty HQ&quot; and is presented with the same Netflixy style of tile interface courtesy of Infinity Ward&#x27;s director of UX/UI William Faler who previously served the same role at Hulu.

Some Modern Warfare 2 weapons will be locked behind challenges that can only be completed on other game modes. Most notably, the M13B Assault Rifle is locked behind a challenge in the game&#x27;s new DMZ mode which will be releasing alongside Warzone 2.0. 


According to screenshots posted by the community, players can unlock the weapon by &quot;defeating the chemist in the radiation zone of DMZ and extracting his dropped weapon.&quot;

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s next free Title Update is right around the corner, and it&#x27;s a good &#x27;un, adding new monster variants, expanded uses for AI hunters, plus a host of welcome tweaks and refinements when it launches next Thursday, 24th November.


On the monster front, there&#x27;re no brand-new additions in Title Update 3, but some existing favourites do get a bit of a makeover. Elder Dragons Kushala Daora and Teostra, for instance, have now shaken off the affliction, only to emerge in Risen form - both available at Master Rank 120 or higher - causing them to become much more menacing when their anger peaks. 


Then there&#x27;s the Chaotic Gore Magala, unlocked at Master Rank 10 or higher. This unfortunate beast has failed to complete the skin-shedding process that would normally see it turn into the Shagaru Magala, leaving it in a &quot;deformed&quot; halfway state that&#x27;s able to use the attacks of both creatures. Sometimes, says Capcom, it will display &quot;expressions of intense agony&quot;.

If even one hit was taken, the run of all games would have to start again from scratch.

Microsoft typically confirms its latest Xbox Game Pass additions via fortnightly blog posts, but does sometimes like to spring surprises on fans. Alas, this is not one of them. 


Speaking to Eurogamer today following press reports that suggested Valhalla was due to arrive on Game Pass in the near future, Ubisoft confirmed this was not the case.

                              <span>The unnamed protagonist of Nier Replicant and his companion Grimoire Weiss are coming to Rainbow Six Siege next week.
The content will be made available as part of the Maverick Replicant bundle. The bundle itself is a part of the Year 7 Season 4 content update for Rainbow Six Siege.
At the end of the teaser video for the bundle, someone wearing a familiar pair of boots walks forward with the caption &quot;A YoRHa soldier is approaching... glory to mankind!&quot; overlaid. It looks like Nier: Automata protagonist 2B will also be involved in the bundle in some way.

Bucky&#x27;s moveset is described as having &quot;echoes&quot; of Avengers core characters Captain America and Black Widow, alongside &quot;all-new animations, a new full skill tree, and heroic abilities all his own&quot;.


The character will be voiced by Friday Night Lights&#x27; Scott Porter, who previously voiced Bucky in Lego Marvel&#x27;s Avengers.

Once Warzone re-launches, however, players will no longer be able to play on two of the game&#x27;s most iconic maps: Rebirth Island and Fortune&#x27;s Keep.

But, yes, it really has been that long. On 15th November 2002, Xbox Live (now known, at least officially, as the Xbox network) arrived in our lives, adding online capability to the original Xbox. 


The service&#x27;s popularity saw a steady increase after the launch of Halo 2 and, needless to say, Microsoft has not looked back since. By January 2021, Microsoft reported there were more than 100m Xbox network subscribers (with this figure including those signed up through the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier).

In an interview with Japanese site Game Watch (via PlayStation Lifestyle), creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro noted that in the early stages of the game, players will control a character other than Clive.




When asked if this was similar to Reks in Final Fantasy 12, he agreed.

Word of the upcoming deal comes from Dealabs, which has accurately given advance notice of Sony&#x27;s monthly PlayStation Plus game line-ups for over a year now (thanks, VGC).

Speaking to The Verge, the CEO of Microsoft Gaming was asked about the decision to delay Starfield and Redfall, two of the company&#x27;s biggest upcoming exclusives.


&quot;It isn&#x27;t really a decision to move a game after spending the team&#x27;s effort over multiple years just to get to a point where you know you&#x27;re not going to deliver the game you want on the date that was promised,&quot; said Spencer. &quot;Now, it is at some level, because I have shipped games too early. We have experienced shipping games too early.&quot;

                              <span>Six months after enjoyable open water survival adventure Raft drifted serenely out of Steam early access, developer Redbeet Interactive has announced it&#x27;s adapting the game for consoles.


Raft, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, first gained attention as a free itch.io prototype back in 2016. After a two year spell expanding the game&#x27;s core survival loop - in which players chart their raft across a vast ocean, reeling in food, supplies, and building materials to turn their initially tiny vessel into a veritable sea-faring palace - Redbeet launched into Steam early access in 2018.


Raft has come a long way since then, gaining the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign for its version 1.0 release on PC, which arrived this June.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re still impatiently awaiting Amazon&#x27;s live-action take on the Fallout universe, you might like a look at a newly released Fallout 76 fan project, admirably capturing the ambience of Bethesda&#x27;s long-running series without, I assume, a budget of 150m Bezosbucks.


Created by YouTube channel Infectious Designer (which has also produced live-action shorts inspired by the likes of Half-Life, Killzone, and Watch Dogs), the Fallout 76 concept trailer serves up two minutes and 35 seconds of impressively realised Fallout splendour, replicating the series distinctive retro-futuristic aesthetic both before and after the nuclear apocalypse.


Now, I&#x27;m not going to pretend to be an expert on Fallout 76 - about the only thing I can say with any confidence is that it&#x27;s the 76th game in the Fallout series - but even to my eyes there&#x27;s some lovely attention to detail in Infectious Designer&#x27;s concept trailer, ranging from an authentic Pip-Boy and a hulking Vault suit to what I think is a CGI Scorchbeast. Oh and there&#x27;s enough Nuka-Cola to rot the teeth clean out of your skull.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has revealed Microsoft&#x27;s decision to &quot;pivot away&quot; from its previously announced Game Pass streaming box earlier this year was due to pricing concerns, with the company unable to get the device within its desired $99-$129 price bracket.


Speaking in the latest episode of The Verge&#x27;s Decoder podcast (as spotted by VGC), Spencer explained, &quot;The console we built that now people have seen...was more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside.&quot;


Microsoft never formally revealed this version of its streaming box, codenamed Keystone - a standalone device utilising a familiar Xbox user interface, according to Spencer - but it did set tongues wagging when a prototype showed up in a photo of the Xbox boss&#x27; office last month.

                              <span>2K and developer Firaxis have formally announced the previously leaked Leader Pass for Civilisation 6, adding 18 leaders to the 4X strategy favourite over the course of six DLC releases.


12 of the 18 leaders featured in the DLC are new to Civilization 6, while six are described as &quot;new takes&quot; on existing leaders. Each is said to offer &quot;surprising new or updated abilities&quot;, alongside &quot;inventive agendas that&#x27;ll change the way you play&quot;.


Up first are Abraham Lincoln (representing the United States), Queen Nzinga Mbande (Kongo), and Sultan Saladin (Arabia), all arriving as part of the diplomacy focused Great Negotiations Pack on 21st November. 2K is yet to provide launch dates for the Leader Pass&#x27; five remaining DLC releases, but all are due before the end of March 2023.

                              <span>Free-to-play fighter MultiVersus&#x27; second season of content is almost upon us, and, in preparation for its arrival later today, developer Player First Games has detailed what players can expect alongside its new Battle Pass and associated rewards - including progression refinements, a new Big Head mode, and an in-game shop.


Much of Season 2&#x27;s launch day changes focus on the Battle Pass experience, with Player First Games having tweaked progression so all tiers now offer rewards. It&#x27;s also tuned the number of points required to complete each tier so the Battle Pass feels &quot;engaging and rewarding&quot;.


As for those rewards, Season 2&#x27;s Battle Pass unlocks the Baker Street Tom and Jerry skin at tier 50 of the free track, and the paid track features Astronaut Velma at tier 1, Tea Time Reindog at tier 42, and Maestro Bugs Bunny at tier 50.

                              <span>Pikmin Bloom, the social walking game from Pokémon Go maker Niantic, recently passed its first birthday and is now hosting a special event themed around Pikmin 3. 


This event in particular caught my eye, as it will allow you to grow the series&#x27; original Red, Blue and Yellow Pikmin varieties dressed up in the space suits of Pikmin 3&#x27;s main characters: Alph, Brittany, and Charlie.


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Pikmin Bloom lets you potter about your neighbourhood growing flower trails and picking up Pikmin seedlings that can grow into Pikmin wearing costumes. If you&#x27;re near a beach, for example, the Pikmin could be wearing a shell, or a discarded bottle cap if collected near a corner shop. It&#x27;s a collection game and a glorified pedometer - and a cute nudge to get off your sofa once in a while.

Available from today on cloud, console and PC are Pentiment and Somerville. Pentiment received a recommended badge from us, and our Donlan described it as &quot;a brilliant narrative adventure that is filled with intelligence and heart&quot;. Donlan also enjoyed Somerville for its beautiful and eerie art direction.

That&#x27;s not it for the month, however. Here&#x27;s what else to look forward to!

CD Projekt Red&#x27;s global PR director Radek Grabowski confirmed this news to GamesRadar earlier today. 


Grabowski did not comment on how much the upcoming expansion will cost, however he did note CDPR&#x27;s expansions are &quot;traditionally cheaper than full-priced games&quot;. So, we are looking at under the £60 mark (phew!).

The patent, titled &quot;Tracking Unique In-Game Digital Assets Using Tokens on a Distributed Ledger&quot; shows a theoretical mechanism for tracking the changes to in-game assets, including ownership, visual appearance and metadata (thanks, Gamesual). 


&quot;Individuals often find it meaningful to own or use unique physical items related to respected celebrities or activities,&quot; the patent description notes.

Until recently the streamer, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr, was working with Sky Sports, helping with its broadcasts of matches for the English Premier League.


However, the channel has now removed almost all traces of the streamer from its social media feeds (although some still remain).

Speaking via the Decoder podcast, Spencer said the company intended to sell Call of Duty on PlayStation &quot;for as long as players want to play Call of Duty on PlayStation&quot;. 


Back in September, Spencer made a written commitment to PlayStation&#x27;s Jim Ryan that Call of Duty will remain on PlayStation. However, Ryan labelled the statement &quot;inadequate on many levels,&quot; while others point out that a commitment is not a legally binding contract.

                              <span>A new DLC pass for Civilization 6 has seemingly been leaked, with an official announcement expected at some point today.

The leak was spotted on the mobile version of the official website for Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization a few days ago. The image has since been taken down from the website, but not before it was downloaded and screenshotted by several people.

The image has been shared to social media sites including Reddit and ResetEra, and claims the new DLC will be titled Leader Pass.

                              <span>The long-running legal battle between Bungie and Destiny cheat software maker AimJunkies appears to finally be near its conclusion - with victory now in sight for Bungie.


US District Court Judge Thomas Zilly has ruled against AimJunkies&#x27; eyebrow-raising bid to countersue Bungie for allegedly accessing its computers - a retaliatory move which the cheating firm claimed amounted to the Destiny maker hacking it.


Now, a new ruling (first reported by Torrentfreak), has dismissed AimJunkies&#x27; defence and left Bungie looking likely to win its original complaint, which alleged that AimJunkie&#x27;s cheating software infringed on Destiny&#x27;s copyright and trademarks.

Publisher Bandai Namco shared this impressive figure, which is accurate as of 30th September, in a recent Q&amp;A for investors.


It means Elden Ring has moved just shy of another million copies since June. Things are clearly going well for Elden Ring!

                              <span>Details of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0&#x27;s Battle Pass have been revealed early, after the game&#x27;s regional account in Australia and New Zealand posted the trailer before promptly taking it down. 


However, the trailer was already captured and reposted across the web, revealing major changes to the franchise&#x27;s battle pass system. 


Activision has abandoned the linear progression of previous seasons of Call of Duty, opting instead for a &quot;combat map&quot; which gives players a sense of choice of what they unlock. It isn&#x27;t a particularly novel idea, with many other live service games already using a modular battle pass model.

The information was revealed by Kirk Ewing on the BBC Sounds podcast Bugzy Malone&#x27;s Grandest Game, in which the rapper talks about the impacts the GTA series had on him.

The podcast also contains a rundown of the series&#x27; history, presented by Chris Warburton.

                              <span>Steam versions of various recent Ubisoft games appear to be on the way, according to datamined store details which have popped up online. 


Earlier this month, a Steam version of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla was spotted in Ubisoft Connect&#x27;s database, prompting speculation the smash hit Viking adventure would finally arrive on Valve&#x27;s PC storefront. To date, PC players have only been able to access Valhalla via Ubisoft&#x27;s own launcher or the Epic Games Store.


A Steam version of Ubisoft sports title Roller Champions was also spotted - and today was also made briefly available to view on SteamDb, all but confirming the game will launch there. Roller Champions feels like it has struggled to find much of an audience to date; a Steam launch would certainly help it along.

PlayStation 4 and 5 owners searching for Warzone 2.0 last night were unable to find the download by searching &quot;Call of Duty Warzone&quot; in the PlayStation Store, while Steam users who own Modern Warfare 2 found no download whatsoever. 

Things are a little better on Xbox where Warzone 2.0 is discoverable with its own store page. Still, on closer inspection, the download confusingly also appears to bundle Modern Warfare 2 for free.

A number of other older Nintendo Switch games have simultaneously been updated, including Super Mario Maker 2 and Splatoon 2.


And the same mysterious update has also been added to Switch smash hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which Nintendo abandoned a year ago, after 18 months of patchy post-launch support.

Even messages shared via encrypted services like WhatsApp are vulnerable, according to POLITICO’s technical review of the application, and two of the outside experts.

These additions are the latest in what Microsoft previously described as a &quot;multi-month series of experiments to learn how to create a more personalised home screen experience and address some of the top trends and fan requests&quot;.


The plan, it explained, is to iterate on these features as testing continues, with the goal being to launch a &quot;new, better Home experience&quot; some time in 2023.

                              <span>An eye-catching Superman demo, made in Unreal Engine 5 and widely circulated online earlier this year, has been taken and sold on Steam as an $11 game.


The original proof-of-concept demo - titled A Superman Style Flight Experience (UE5) - was created by Toybox Games&#x27; Tyson Butler-Boschma, utilising the City Sample from Epic Games&#x27; The Matrix Awakens as a sandbox for superhero flight. In April, Butler-Boschma made the playable demo freely available via itch.io, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s here things begin to go awry.


At the start of November, Butler-Boschma was alerted to the fact an entity calling itself Hero Game Studios had taken his demo - a project he created &quot;for fun to show what could be made&quot; in Unreal Engine 5 - and started selling it on Steam under the name Heroes City Superman Edition with an asking price of $10.99 USD.

Microsoft says it&#x27;s publishing its inaugural Digital Transparency Report as part of its &quot;long-standing commitment to online safety&quot;, with the aim being to release an updated report every six months so it can address key learnings and do more to &quot;help people understand how to play a positive role in the Xbox community.&quot;


Much of the document is spent reiterating the various tools and processes Microsoft and Xbox players have at their disposal to ensure users remain safe and community guidelines are adhered to, ranging from parental controls to reporting.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök portrays Kratos as a somewhat more level-headed god-killing powerhouse than in some of his past adventures which, to be honest, showed Sony&#x27;s protagonist in a less, erm, morally sound light. Ok, ok, let&#x27;s face it, Kratos was a bit of a knob in the past.


One NPC that would whole-heartily agree with me on this is the boat captain from the original God of War. Remember him? It is hard not to, as he was certainly put through it by Kratos. 

Please note, some of the below could be considered spoilers. If you&#x27;re still reading and want to go into the God of War series blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

                              <span>Creature collecting game DokeV from South Korean developer Pearl Abyss has been delayed.


The news was announced as part of the Pearl Abyss Q3 earnings presentation. 


Both DokeV and the company&#x27;s much-anticipated MMO Crimson Desert have been delayed, the latter into the second half of 2023 and the former past its original target of 2023.

CD Projekt says this update will include &quot;a plethora of enhancements including ray tracing, faster loading times, and the introduction of additional new content inspired by The Witcher Netflix series&quot;.

                              <span>Tactics Ogre: Reborn has a silly swear filter which is blocking one of the game&#x27;s own default names it can suggest for you to use.


The revamped role-playing classic will offer the title of &quot;Flamescale&quot; for characters whose date of birth is listed as between 2nd and 25th May. However, the game then tells you &quot;Flamescale&quot; is actually not allowed, as it contains &quot;banned words&quot;.


This issue, picked up by fan Choojermelon on Twitter (thanks, PCGamer) appears to stem from the name&#x27;s inclusion of &quot;mescal&quot;, the illegal psychedelic enjoyed by Hunter S. Thompson and others.

That&#x27;s no different with Sonic Frontiers. While Sonic is free in the open zone, the cyberspace levels show up the awkwardness of Sonic&#x27;s movement.


Now there&#x27;s a mod to fix that, courtesy of BeatzYT3 over on GameBanana. Their Improved Physics mod makes a number of changes to momentum and balance to ensure Sonic&#x27;s movement feels more fluid.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök is an impressive looking game, there is no denying it. The sweeping vistas of the Nine Realms are breathtaking, and suit the norse epic&#x27;s overarching narrative perfectly. 


But would this game work as well if it had been released in the 90s? Given the look of a recent fan-made demake trailer, I would absolutely have still played it!


The demake trailer in question comes from creator Jackarte. It sees heroes Kratos and Atreus, as well as Ragnarök&#x27;s towering god Tyr and the vengeful Freya, all reimagined as PlayStation 1 characters.

                              <span>Nintendo of Japan has updated its terms and conditions to allow its customer service staff to refuse repair requests if faced with harrassment. 


An update to Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese repair and warranty regulations in October warned customers they may no longer be eligible for a product repair or replacement if they are found to have behaved inappropriately to staff. 


This includes instances where a staff member has been threatened or verbally abused, or where a customer may have been deliberately wasting their time.

According to SteamDB, the game&#x27;s all-time peak is at 19,181 concurrent players.


The previous record was set by Sonic Mania around five years ago, with 11,937 concurrent players.

An upcoming fan-project known as Jurassic Park Operations from Krenautican sees action from the 1993 film reimaged in PlayStation&#x27;s game creation system. And, I won&#x27;t lie, it looks so good I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn&#x27;t watching something from Spielberg himself.


While this project has evidently been in the works for a while, the team recently revealed its full trailer for the game.

                              <span>An European Commission staff member has raised eyebrows for their public comments on the organisation&#x27;s ongoing investigation into Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover bid - and prompted the EU Commission itself to respond. 


Last week, Commission member Ricardo Cardoso tweeted to say that the organisation was &quot;working to ensure that you will still be able to play Call of Duty on other consoles (including my PlayStation).&quot;


On the one hand, the comment simply describes the situation as Microsoft has too - that Activision&#x27;s blockbuster shooter franchise will remain on Sony platforms &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to&quot;. On the other, fans expressed surprise a Commission staff member was discussing the matter publicly, and expressing an opinion which seemed mostly concerned with their own console choice.

Amy was first introduced to the series in Sonic The Hedgehog CD as a love interest, but their relationship was always implied to be unrequited. Sonic is far too busy going really fast to have a relationship.


But YouTuber Faz Faz has discovered unused dialogue in the game&#x27;s files in which Sonic ponders their relationship, spotted by TheGamer.

                              <span>Fortnite has stunned fans by signalling an early end to its third map at the conclusion of its current season, via a live event named Fracture set to take place at 9pm UK time on 3rd December. 


Fracture was teased tonight by developer Epic Games at the conclusion of Fortnite Champion Series, its first major in-person Fortnite competition for several years. A title card for Fracture appeared after the tournament&#x27;s trophy presentation, simply listing the upcoming live event&#x27;s date, time, and description as the &quot;Chapter 3 Finale event&quot;. 


Each in-game &quot;Chapter&quot; of Fortnite has so far concluded with a complete reboot of the battle royale&#x27;s beloved Island. After two years and 10 seasons, the game&#x27;s original Island got sucked into a black hole in October 2019. After another two years, this time divided into eight seasons, the game&#x27;s second Island was flipped over to reveal the current map lying underneath in December 2021.

In an interview with IGN, Diablo 4 director Joe Shely and general manager Rod Fergusson opened up on what the new adventure has in store for fans of the franchise, as well as give a little insight into how the game&#x27;s storytelling mechanics will differ from the Diablo games that have come before it.

&quot;One of the concerns about putting &#x27;open world&#x27; in a big neon and flashing that sign is that people have that notion of Breath of the Wild, &#x27;oh, it’s completely organic and I can go anywhere and do anything&#x27;,&quot; Fergusson said, as transcribed by NME.

In a tweet posted to Twitter and spotted by VGC, Kishimoto intimated that although the team was &quot;relieved&quot; that the game was finally out and in the hands of players, it was &quot;checking the opinions of the critics and everyone&quot; and still had &quot;a long way to go&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t contact you because I&#x27;ve been busy since the release date,&quot; Kishimoto tweeted to their followers, as translated by Google. &quot;I&#x27;m relieved that the release date has arrived and that it seems to have reached everyone safely.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is still on track for a 2023 release - and we may get a formal release date as early as next month.

That&#x27;s according to a new dev blog on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Steam page, which also promises we&#x27;ll get a peek at new features &quot;before the year is out&quot; courtesy of Patch 9.

&quot;The good news is that we’re on track for release in 2023 – and we’ll have more on that in December,&quot; the blog confirms. &quot;Acts 2 and 3 of the story are being actively playtested to ensure they’re up to the same level of polish and you’ll soon discover that there’s much more in the works (or already complete) than what you’ll encounter in an Early Access playthrough.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves season 8 kicks off on 22nd November.

Developer Rare tweeted the news late yesterday, along with confirmation that a full reveal of what&#x27;s coming up will be streamed next Friday, 18th November, at 7pm UK time (4pm UTC, 8am PT / 11am ET).

Hopefully we&#x27;ll find out more about the community&#x27;s decision in the current Adventure, Return of the Damned, too, alongside sneaky peeks about other new Adventures and Mysteries, the Plunder Pass, and usual bug and QoL fixes.

                              <span>EA and Motive have revealed the voice actors cast in its Dead Space remake.

Although we already knew that previously silent protagonist Isaac Clarke would now be voiced by Gunner Wright - the original voice of Isaac in Dead Space 2 and 3 - Motive has now revealed the rest of the cast.

Tanya Clarke - no relation to Isaac - is back as Nicole Brennan, having provided her voice and likeness in the first game and Dead Space 2. Former NHL athlete Anthony Alabi is on board to portray the no-nonsense Zach Hammond, fresh from his roles in Shameless and Family Reunion.

                              <span>I have a new book coming out in February. It’s about hacking.
A Hacker’s Mind: How the Powerful Bend Society’s Rules, and How to Bend them Back isn’t about hacking computer systems; it’s about hacking more general economic, political, and social systems. It generalizes the term hack as a means of subverting a system’s rules in unintended ways.
What sorts of system? Any system of rules, really. Take the tax code, for example. It’s not computer code, but it’s a series of algorithms—supposedly deterministic—that take a bunch of inputs about your income and produce an output that’s the amount of money you owe. This code has vulnerabilities; we call them loopholes. It has exploits; those are tax avoidance strategies. And there is an entire industry of black-hat hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the tax code: we call them accountants and tax attorneys...</span>

Given all we learned from Edward Snowden, this feels like a minor coda. There’s nothing really interesting in the IG document, which is heavily redacted.

                              <span>When Sony unveiled release details for PSVR2 earlier this month, it only confirmed two launch day titles - Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Quest 2 port Cities VR: Enhanced Edition. However, it turns out No Man&#x27;s Sky fans also have something to look forward to, with Hello Games confirming to Eurogamer that its previously announced PSVR2 update will be arriving alongside Sony&#x27;s new hardware on 22nd February next year.


Hello Games revealed a PSVR2 update for No Man&#x27;s Sky was in the works back in June, teasing an enhanced VR experience that would utilise the power of PlayStation 5, PSVR2, and its new Sense controllers to build on the game&#x27;s 2019 VR implementation, and &quot;take that sense of immersion and believability up by several major notches.&quot;


Evidence that PSVR2 owners wouldn&#x27;t have to wait long for No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s promised VR upgrade first surfaced earlier this week when sharp-eyed PS5 Store users (by which I mean Eurogamer&#x27;s resident VR aficionado Ian Higton) spotted an updated description on Hello Games&#x27; PSVR2 reveal trailer, pointing to a February 2022 release.

                              <span>Kevin Conroy, perhaps best known for his much-loved portrayal of Batman in TV&#x27;s Animated Series and the Arkham series of games, has died aged 66 following a short battle with cancer.


Conroy, whose acting career began in the late 70s, first voiced Batman in Fox Kids&#x27; Batman: The Animated series, which would go on to run for 85 episodes between 1992 and 1995. His portrayal has remained a fan favourite ever since, with Conroy later voicing the role across a multitude of mediums, including 15 films.


In video games, he made his mark on the likes of developer Rocksteady&#x27;s acclaimed Arkham trilogy, NetherRealm&#x27;s superhero fighter Injustice, and, more recently, MultiVersus.

Krafton made the announcement in its latest earnings report, saying the acquisition was part of an ongoing investment in its &quot;development and service capabilities [that would] ensure a steady pipeline of premium titles&quot;.


Although Neon Giant only has one title to its name so far -  last year&#x27;s cyberpunk action-RPG The Ascent - the Swedish studio was founded by industry veterans with credits on the likes of Doom, Wolfenstein, Gears of War, and Far Cry 3.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök is already pulling in some impressive numbers for Sony. 


According to charts firm GfK, the game&#x27;s day one physical sales in the UK were greater than &quot;any other full-week launch sales for other titles in this franchise&quot;.


Speaking to GameIndustry.biz, GfK boss Dorian Bloch stated &quot;God of War Ragnarök will debut at No.1&quot; on next week&#x27;s sales charts, while noting it is the &quot;first cross-gen title in the series&quot;.

In the latest episode, which aired today in Japan with the rest of the world to follow, Ash wins the Masters Eight Tournament of the Pokémon World Coronation Series.


This is the culmination of 25 years since Ash and his Pikachu began their journey in the Kanto region - and he&#x27;s barely aged.

Among its various updates, the duty support system will now be extended to include remaining Heavensward dungeons. That means almost the entire game, besides Stormblood, will be playable solo.


Further changes will also come in patch 6.35, including an update to the farming sim mode Island Sanctuary.

                              <span>Earlier this week we heard the unusual news that player-versus-player MMO Crowfall, which launched in the summer of 2021, will be taken offline and taken back to the drawing board, where it will be rethought. There&#x27;s no word on how long this will take, only that &quot;nothing is off the table&quot; in terms of what potentially may change.
Game operator Monumental said this was because it didn&#x27;t have the headspace or resources to rethink the game while it was running it, and suggested Crowfall could return looking quite different indeed. If, that is, it returns. Crowfall has struggled since launch, and it was sold to Monumental in December 2021 partly because of this - because it needed significant change.
I cannot ever remember an MMO ever doing something similar. In this article, I talk to Monumental about the decision and what it could mean. But first, a bit of background.

                              <span>After months (and months) of anticipation, God of War Ragnarök finally released this week. Now that it is out in the world, many - myself included - are taking some time to marvel at how truly packed the nine realms really are. 


The amount of detail Sony Santa Monica has put into its game is astounding, from animals scurrying through trees right down to Kratos&#x27; wrinkled elbows. But some of these details and Easter eggs are easily missed, so here is a small selection of ones that I have noticed so far. 

Please note, some of these details could be considered spoilers. If you&#x27;re still reading and want to go into the game blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

                              <span>One God of War Ragnarök fan has found, and subsequently unlocked, the game&#x27;s unfinished photo mode. 


Developer Sony Santa Monica recently stated that, while a photo mode would not be available on the game&#x27;s launch, it would be coming further down the line by way of an update. This is much the same as with 2018&#x27;s God of War. 


However, prolific modder Speclizer (who was responsible for unearthing the canned multiplayer map files in the Last of Us Part 2) has managed to find Ragnarök&#x27;s photo mode and get it working.

In a blog post alongside the announcement, game director Mikael Kasurinen described the sequel as &quot;the most exciting project I&#x27;ve ever worked on&quot;.

But, it now looks like this is also going to include any future games, with Warner Bros Discovery head David Zaslav recently expressing his excitement for the new structure Gunn and Safran would bring to the studio along with their appointment.

                              <span>Another Thursday means another glimpse ahead at the Epic Games Store&#x27;s next set of weekly freebies, with Evil Dead: The Game and tactical turn-based RPG Dark Deity both now confirmed to be free from Thurday, 17th November.


Evil Dead: The Game, which released as an Epic exclusive back in May, is developer Saber Interactive&#x27;s spin on the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre. It sees four human Survivors (picking from a range of familiar Evil Dead characters, armed with everything from chainsaws to boomsticks) roaming a spooky forest in search of artefacts, while a fifth player gives chase as one of four powerful demons - the Warlord, Puppeteer, Necromancer, or Plaguebringer, all able to command undead armies of their own.


And it&#x27;s good fun, effectively marrying the gleefully cartoonish horror of Sam Raimi&#x27;s beloved franchise to a solidly entertaining multiplayer game.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Absolution, Netflix&#x27;s latest stab at adapting a beloved video games series for the small screen, has a release date, with the six-part animated series airing from 9th December.


Announced back in June, Dragon Age: Absolution takes place in Tevinter - the setting for developer BioWare&#x27;s highly anticipated next video game instalment, Dragon Age Dreadwolf - and stars a cast of fresh faces, including protagonist Miriam.


&quot;With great power at stake, a group of mages, fighters, and thieves goes head to head against a sinister force possessing a dangerous artifact,&quot; Netflix teases beneath its newly released Absolution trailer. &quot;Fear. Guilt. Pain. Can Miriam push aside her feelings to complete her mission - or will the trauma looming over her past finally catch up with her?&quot;.

The studio made the announcement in its latest developer update, which highlights some of the new additions coming to Battlefield 2042 as part of Season 3 and beyond.


Season 3, which is yet to receive an official start date, includes a new multiplayer map, a new Specialist, new weapons - including Bad Company 2&#x27;s XM8 and Battlefield 3&#x27;s A-91 - plus a new Battle Pass. It&#x27;ll also usher in map reworks for Manifest and Breakaway.

Blood Origin isn&#x27;t Netflix&#x27;s first Witcher prequel, of course; last year saw the streaming service release an animated movie called The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, focusing on Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s friend and mentor Vesemir.


Blood Origin, though, goes some considerable way further back in the series&#x27; timeline, telling a story set 1,200 years before Geralt and the events we&#x27;re familiar with from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s books, CD Projekt&#x27;s games, and Netflix&#x27;s existing TV show.

                              <span>Mick Gordon, known for his work on soundtracks for several games including the Wolfenstein and Doom series, has released a statement in response to accusations made against him by Marty Stratton in May 2020.

In April 2020, Gordon distanced himself from the soundtrack album for Doom Eternal after it received criticisms from fans on its quality. This led to speculation from fans about its production, and Stratton, who was working as executive producer on Doom Eternal, posted an open letter to the Doom subreddit to address rumours. 

A year and a half later, Gordon has written a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton&#x27;s claims, with screenshots of emails and legal documents (with sensitive information removed) as evidence of the true timeline of events. He posted his statement on Medium, in which he alleged abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton. Gordon stated he has released it to defend himself, and urged people to not use it as an excuse for a hate campaign.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing the now-widespread leaks of new Pokémon designs from the upcoming Scarlet and Violet games.

Pokémon details always leak - often months before launch, but especially in the last few weeks as retail copies begin appearing in the wild. Should you look at spoilers? For some, uncovering the many unannounced creatures as they play is a core part of the games. For others, knowing what your new Starter Pokémon will eventually evolve into is a big deal.  
Whichever side of the debate you&#x27;re on, there&#x27;s no doubting the level of interest in new Pokémon designs - seen this week when the final evolution of Starter cat creature Sprigatito sparked an avalanche of dubious fanart after an image was posted by a leaker. Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

This included a little bit more on its brand-new &quot;experience&quot; known as DMZ.


This Escape From Tarkov-inspired mode is described as an &quot;open-world, narrative-focused extraction mode where Operator squads have free rein to complete faction-based missions, take on additional side objectives, engage with enemy Operators or AI combatants, and search for valuable items, all while fighting to survive toward exfiltration&quot;.

                              <span>Iconic Halo map Blood Gulch has been recreated in the game&#x27;s new Forge mode, just hours after its official beta went live. 


The long-awaited Forge offering officially arrived yesterday as part of Halo Infinite&#x27;s Winter Update, and of course Blood Gulch was one of the first things on anyone&#x27;s mind to recreate.


Halo fan Epsilon_church_ posted word of their creation to Twitter yesterday evening and invited others to try the map for themselves. Amusingly, however, it needed to be named &quot;Coagulation&quot;, as &quot;BloodGulch&quot; was blocked.

It&#x27;s been developed by PixelCount Studios, comprising veterans of the Fable series, and chaired by Games Workshop founder Sir Ian Livingstone.

                              <span>Google has begun the long process of refunding all Stadia customers for their hardware, games and in-game purchases - something it hopes to have completed by 18th January 2023, the date Stadia servers are switched off. 


A detailed FAQ page on the process is now available for Stadia customers to browse, but in a nutshell it boils down to: sit tight. 


Google will attempt to refund you for most things you bought to do with Stadia - except for the Stadia Pro subscription. It&#x27;ll keep your money for that.

The game  previously had a demo shortly before it released on 10th June, but required a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. 

The new demo is free to download for all Switch owners.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Sony gave its PlayStation Plus subscription service a makeover, adding three new tiers for users to pick between. 


The cheapest of these tiers is Essential and is basically what PlayStation Plus once was. Users get online play, some other smaller perks and free PlayStation titles every month. Then we have Extra. This middle-ground tier includes everything that comes with Essential, but with the bonus of a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games to have a go at.


Then, finally, we have the most expensive of these tiers, known as Premium. This was marketed as a way for users to replay some of PlayStation&#x27;s classic games from days gone by. The service covers every PlayStation console - from the original PS1 through to the PS5, as well as the PSP and, thanks to streaming, PS3 support.

The blue blur is known for going really fast, so it&#x27;s appreciated that the developers took care to not let that negatively affect players.


Producer Sachiko Kawamura told Famitsu that the QA team were integral to this process and that it was important to take this aspect of the game seriously (thanks Siliconera).

For a small fee, anyone can now pay up and receive a blue Twitter verified tick next to their name. So, of course, people are handing over their $8 specifically in order to trick others online.


A verified &quot;Nintendo of America&quot; account went viral last night as it posted an image of the company&#x27;s mascot Mario giving the middle finger. The handle, @nIntendoofus, has now had their account suspended - but not until their tweets had been widely shared.

                              <span>Activision has shared a whole load of information on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0&#x27;s first season ahead of its arrival next Wednesday, 16th November, including details of a major battle pass overhaul.


Ditching the linear level progression still used by most games, Call of Duty&#x27;s new battle pass will adopt a system reminiscent of that seen in Fortnite, where players have more freedom in which battle pass items they can unlock and when.


Activision&#x27;s battle pass overhaul presents itself as a multi-sector map, with players able to unlock five items in each of its 20 sectors using earned Battle Token Tier skips. These tokens can either unlock more items within an already available sector or unlock adjacent sectors.

                              <span>20 months after developer SCS announced American Truck Simulator was setting its sights on Texas as one of its next destinations, the long-in-the-works expansion finally has a release date and is coming to Steam next Tuesday, 15th November.


Texas will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 11th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It was confirmed to be in development last March, but SCS warned the expansion could be a long time coming given the sheer effort required to bring one of the US&#x27; largest states into the game.


However, with Texas&#x27; arrival now less than a week away, SCS has given us our best look yet at the expansion&#x27;s numerous familiar sights - its newly released  launch trailer featuring the likes of Austin, Houston, and a whole lot of countryside.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s latest Indie World Showcase is now over, and while it might have been regrettably devoid of any new Silksong details, it did at least reveal more of Sidebar Games&#x27; long-awaited Golf Story follow-up, Sports Story - alongside the surprise reveal that it&#x27;s out in December.


There&#x27;s a lot more where that came from though, with Nintendo choosing to highlight over 20 promising new indie titles heading to Switch before next summer is through - a few of which, such as the wonderful Rogue Legacy 2, are out today. Read on for the full round-up!

                              <span>Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have published an explosive open letter to fans detailing their ousting from ZA/UM, the game&#x27;s development studio.
Most eye-opening is the claim ZA/UM&#x27;s new majority shareholder, an Estonian firm named Tütreke OÜ, allegedly obtained control of the company through fraud. Tütreke OÜ is a &quot;vehicle&quot; for two Estonian businessmen, the pair wrote, namely Ilmar Kompus (now ZA/UM&#x27;s CEO) and Tõnis Haavel (who was previously &quot;convicted for defrauding investors on a different matter in 2007&quot;).


At the same time, ZA/UM CEO Kompus has published, via Estonian newspaper Ekspress, allegations of mismanagement by Kurvitz and a previous minority shareholder of the company, Saandar Taal. The pair are accused of &quot;belittling women and co-workers&quot; and creating a &quot;toxic environment&quot;. Kompus also states the pair had been &quot;intending to steal IP&quot; - namely, Disco Elysium - with an eye to departing the studio and working elsewhere.

Servers for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, and Dark Souls 3 were &quot;temporarily deactivated&quot; back in January following reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying the issue would&#x27;t be addressed until after the release of Elden Ring, but Dark Souls fans&#x27; patience was finally rewarded in August when online features for Dark Souls 3 were restored. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin followed in October, with the publisher promising to reactive servers for the original Dark Souls 2 at &quot;a later date&quot;.

This is the game&#x27;s first major update which Volition previously said would be used to prioritise fixes and improvements over new content. Last month, the studio said it had chosen to spend time bringing the existing game up to scratch - even though it would have &quot;preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions&quot;.

&quot;Significant effort and testing&quot; has gone into fixing the game&#x27;s co-op, Volition said today. Connectivity, map issues and rewards should all work more smoothly post-patch.

                              <span>Ahead of its release next summer, Final Fantasy 16 has received plenty of praise for its colossal Eikon battles between mythical beasts, stunning fantasy realm, and fast-paced action full of spectacular magical effects.


But one major criticism has been the distinct lack of diversity in its main cast.


Last week, director Naoki Yoshida addressed the lack of diversity in an interview. It fits the &quot;isolated nature of this realm&quot; he said, as well as the inspiration of Medieval Europe.

                              <span>Nothing can stop the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet leaks - not least the dozens and dozens of Pokémon fans already turning the game&#x27;s latest still-officially-unannounced creature into somewhat dubious fan art.


If you ever need reminding how popular Pokémon is, simply type one of the creatures&#x27; names into social media and see how many image results you get. This is true even for Pokémon so far only glimpsed in leaked screenshots from early copies, images of which Nintendo is busy scrubbing from the internet.


Fan art created from seeing these leaked images, though, is another matter. For example, this morning I learned the final evolution of Grass-type cat and Scarlet and Violet Starter Pokémon Sprigatito had leaked online after I saw someone on Twitter discussing its design. (And if you&#x27;re still reading and want to go into the new games blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.)

                              <span>PC streaming via PlayStation Plus is still unavailable in many European countries, fans have told Eurogamer.


As well as streaming games to consoles, Sony&#x27;s subscription service allows players to stream games on PC.


However, as a PlayStation Blog from the release in May states, PC streaming is not available in the following countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The news comes courtesy of artist Thomas Feichtmeir who released a screenshot of artwork used in the pitch to the publisher six years ago - now, the NDA is finally up.


Feichtmeir also worked on Blasphemous, itself a Metroidvania inspired by the Dark Souls series.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever played Destiny, you&#x27;ll know of Telesto. This exotic weapon is a fan-favourite for its exploding purple projectiles - and also notorious for often being bugged. 


It&#x27;s broken nature is so notorious, in fact, that Destiny developer Bungie has now added an Easter egg to the game where Telesto fails to properly fire - and instead sends its projectiles floating lazily into the sky while the weapon itself fizzes and sparks. (A simple reload clears the Easter egg, and the gun can then be used as normal.)


But while this appeared at first to be just a fun nod to Telesto&#x27;s oft-bugged state, fans are now suggesting the Easter egg may hint at a further secret, as Destiny 2 heads towards the end of its current season.

The move will see Meta&#x27;s overall workforce shrink by 13 percent, with some areas of the business impacted more than others. 


Specifically how this will impact the company&#x27;s development of Meta Quest remains unclear, though Zuckerburg stated today that the company&#x27;s &quot;long-term vision for the metaverse&quot; remained one of a small number of &quot;high priority growth areas&quot;.

The option is all part of Capcom&#x27;s efforts to make its forthcoming fighting game the most accessible yet.


A few simple button taps is enough to have your character performing all sorts of moves, determined dynamically by the A.I. based on character position and situation.

The list includes blockchain-based metaverse game Uplandme, for which it is launching &quot;FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 in the Upland Metaverse&quot;.
