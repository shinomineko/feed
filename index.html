                              <span>A new leak has given us an early peek at what games may be coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium next month.

According to ResetEra&#x27;s BlackBate - a mysterious poster who&#x27;s correctly leaked games ahead of schedule before - it looks like subscribers to Sony&#x27;s top two PS+ tiers will see the following games join the collection: Stray (which ties in with what we already knew), FFVII Remake Intergrade + FF7R EPISODE INTERmission, Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV Black Flag, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Rogue Remastered, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Freedom Cry, Assassin&#x27;s Creed The Ezio Collection, and Saints Row IV: Re-Elected.

BlackBate reckons the games will join the PS Plus library on 19th July - yes, Stray&#x27;s release date - and states that these are only &quot;some of the games&quot;, perhaps hinting there are more to come.

                              <span>Award-winning writer and narrative designer Anna Megill has taken over as narrative lead on Playground Games&#x27; Fable reboot.

Megill - who was previously lead writer for the project and is who we have to &quot;thank&quot; for those nightmareish puppets in Control - made the announcement on Twitter, saying she had some &quot;exciting news to end the week&quot;.

Megill&#x27;s CV is an impressive one, featuring story-rich games such as Control - for which she was also narrative lead - Dishonored: Death of the Outsider, and Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

                              <span>Blizzard is celebrating the recent seventh anniversary of its MOBA Heroes of the Storm by trimming development in order to focus only &quot;on client sustainability and bug fixing&quot;. 

In a brief update posted yesterday on the official website, Blizzard said it would now treat the MOBA in a &quot;manner similar to our other longstanding games, StarCraft and StarCraft II&quot; by continuing seasonal rolls and hero rotations, but with no plans for new &quot;for-purchase content to be added&quot;.

As a thank you to all who&#x27;ve stuck with the game, Blizzard is offering the &quot;incredibly rare&quot; Epic Arcane Lizard mount to all players with next week’s patch.

This new Team Deathmatch sees four duos duking it out to take control of five arenas across the Prague map, whilst the new Summer pass - offering 100 &quot;levels of progression&quot; - will be available for &quot;only&quot; 600 tokens. 

Sharkmob also confirms that instead of the &quot;standard&quot; 12-week battle pass, Bloodhunt will now focus on monthly content drops instead.

At one meter/four feet long, it&#x27;s a &quot;faithful&quot; 1:1 replication that includes an illuminated scope and comes in &quot;premium showpiece packaging, covered with intricate details inspired from Destiny lore&quot;.

&quot;In addition to capturing the look of this overpowering launcher, the NERF LMTD Gjallarhorn blaster includes the first-ever NERF Mega dart shells, which each hold 3 NERF Mega darts and fire 3 darts at a time,&quot; Bungie explains. &quot;Load a shell into the breech, prime, and pull the trigger to send all 3 darts bursting from the blaster. The NERF Gjallarhorn blaster includes 3 shells and 9 darts.&quot;

Out on 13th July as part of Update 18.2 - initially just for PC, I&#x27;m afraid; the console release will follow on 21st July - Deston includes a flooded downtown, a swamp, coastlines, &quot;one of the tallest skyscrapers in the game&quot; as well as the Lodge, the &quot;biggest building ever made&quot; in the game.

                              <span>IO Ineractive has given us a first look at the new level coming to Hitman 3, known as Ambrose Island.
Agent 47 is certainly not one to stay put for long, and he is now readying himself for his next holiday (sorry, I mean mission). While many of us can only dream of having the opportunity to see the world as readily as he does, for Agent 47 this is all just part of a standard day. So, what of his next destination? 
Well, once you set yours and 47&#x27;s feet onto the tropical isles of Ambrose Island you will most definitely be stepping into dangerous territory. In fact, you will be stepping into pirate territory. So, you had better get ready for your buckles to be swashed. You can check out the new reveal trailer below.

                              <span>Rockstar has told fans not to expect any further major updates for Red Dead Online, as it continues to shift development resource towards Grand Theft Auto 6.


It&#x27;s bad news for Red Dead Online players, who have for some time complained the game had been underserved and overlooked by Rockstar in comparison to the more lucrative GTA Online. 


Now, Rockstar has laid out its plan to keep Red Dead Online on life support and acknowledged its greater focus on GTA6.

                              <span>It is time to take another trip to Middle Earth, this time with the precious-seeking Gollum. 
A new trailer for the upcoming release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has given us all a closer look at gameplay. Here, we see the titular Gollum scaling walls, skulking in the shrubbery, and popping off orcs with rocks. 
We also get to have a closer look at some of the other characters from Middle-earth. These include Gandalf and the elven king Thranduil, a mysterious new elf (who I suspect may be Mel from the preview I was invited to earlier this year), the Nazgûl and the eight-legged wonder Shelob. You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>Facebook&#x27;s parent company has detailed its new Meta account system, which will be offered as an alternative way of logging in to Meta VR devices.


Previously-announced plans to make Facebook logins a requirement for Meta VR headsets had been hugely unpopular and plagued with problems. 


Now, we know roughly when and how an alternative plan will be put into practice: in August, and via the launch of a fresh, pared-back account system with a separate social profile named Meta Horizon.

The playtest was recently announced, allowing players a look at an early build of the game. But already details have been leaking from it, including information on its map, character customisation, and in-game currency.


Now videos from the playtest have popped up on reddit, giving everyone a look at the game.

                              <span>Hot off the heels of The Quarry, another horror-filled game from Supermassive is coming our way. This time, we&#x27;re heading back to its Dark Pictures series, with The Devil in Me.
A new trailer for this upcoming release has given us two things. The first is a launch window of this autumn. The second is an unnerving look at the game&#x27;s Saw-like story, which sees a group of film makers make their way to to a replica of the &#x27;Murder House&#x27; of HH Holmes, America&#x27;s first serial killer. Obviously, things are not going to go smoothly for our group of intrepid young&#x27;uns.
Unlike previous entries in its Dark Pictures series, The Devil in Me does not appear going down the paranormal or supernatural route. Rather, it looks to be rooted in a pretty grim but very believable reality akin to the aforementioned Saw and the Hostel series of films. There are traps for our unsuspecting victims to trigger, there&#x27;re torture rooms, there is tension, and there are some creepy-as mannequins. You can see for yourself below.

                              <span>Pokémon Puzzle League for the N64 will be the next Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack game, Nintendo has announced. 


Originally launched in 2000, this pocket monster puzzler plays similarly to Panel de Pon, albeit with tiles themed around Pokémon types.


Perhaps my favourite thing about it is the game&#x27;s heavily influence from the early days of the Pokémon anime - so expect appearances and slightly distorted sound clips from Ash, Misty, Brock and Team Rocket as you clear tiles. Here&#x27;s a refresher:

Both were announced last night during publisher Nacon&#x27;s latest showcase, with RoboCop: Rogue City coming from Teyon, the developer behind the very wonky Terminator: Resistance.


RoboCop: Rogue City will be a first-person shooter, and of the two new games looks to be one we&#x27;ll see launch first - in June 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Let&#x27;s take a look:

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra said his company wanted &quot;to return to a live event that enables us to celebrate the community&quot; and was &quot;committed to bringing back BlizzCon&quot; next year. 


The annual BlizzCon event held in Anaheim has recently been pushed online due to Covid, and was then scrapped completely this year as Blizzard faced various allegations of staff misconduct and a toxic company culture.

                              <span>Mike Ybarra, the head of Blizzard, has spoken out about the controversial microtransactions found in Diablo Immortal. 

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Ybarra implied that complaints surrounding Diablo Immortal&#x27;s in-game purchases were limited to a small minority, and indeed, that Blizzard had specifically designed its free-to-play experience so the majority of players would still enjoy the bulk of the game. 


Ybarra pointed to the game&#x27;s high rating and number of positive reviews on the App Store, and suggested these contrasted with  some of the negative headlines and complaints which have been reported.

                              <span>PlayStation 5 users, we now have another update. This one, with the ever-catchy title of Version: 22.01-05.50.00, went live today.
This update is for the system software and includes the following (via Sony):

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Balmung server is being protected by a barricade of catgirls.


That&#x27;s thanks to the new Data Centre Travel system that allows players to visit other worlds - it was so popular it was taken down soon after it launched but is now back up.


Balmung is known for its roleplayers, notoriously of a more erotic kind, and has seen an influx of players visiting.

                              <span>For those that recall the 2003 E3 demo for Halo 2 - yes, the Earthcity one that everyone loved at the time but that never made its way into the final game - I have good news for you. 343 Industries has teamed up with some modders, and as a result, almost two decades later we will soon be able to actually play that demo again.
&quot;We have a special treat for you this month,&quot; started 343 community writer Alex Wakeford in a very in-depth blog post yesterday.
&quot;Something that becomes part of the great journey of many Halo fans is learning about all the stuff that didn&#x27;t make it into the games over the years,&quot; he teased before revealing, &quot;I can confirm we are working on a rebuild of the original E3 Earthcity scenario that makes it playable in modern retail Halo 2.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has said it will attend Gamescom 2022, which returns in-person to Cologne in August for the first time in three years. 


Details on what exactly Microsoft will show remain vague, other than a promise we&#x27;ll see updates on previously-announced games set to be released over the coming 12 months.


This is a similar-sounding promise to what we saw recently at the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase, which concluded with new gameplay footage of Starfield.

The player became notorious in the Elden Ring community for assisting players with the game&#x27;s infamously tricky Malenia boss, defeating her a thousand times.



In response, Bandai Namco sent the player a boxed sword, complete with map scroll and wooden plaque, with the message: &quot;Congratulations on your great accomplishment&quot;.

Both digital stores were quietly made inaccessible back in March. When asked about their status at the time, Nintendo subsequently told Eurogamer the stores were &quot;undergoing maintenance&quot;, and no date was given for their return. 


Indeed, some fans had begun wondering if the stores would ever return at all.

                              <span>Report by Georgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technology published a comprehensive report on the surprising amount of mass surveillance conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</span>

To celebrate this latest anniversary, Pokémon Go maker Niantic has released another of its annual celebratory artworks - which regularly tease what the next 12 months may bring. 


Pokémon fans have been poring over the image, though the most noticable additions here are two brand-new characters - potentially the game&#x27;s next two NPCs.

Nightclub events and parties are common in the MMORPG, often with DJ sets on Twitch.


But owners of the Rain Nightclub bought four billboards in Texas and California to advertise their event, which included modded outfits and use of the Final Fantasy 14 logo (thanks PCGamer).

The detail was dropped rather unexpectedly last night, as part of an official Xbox Twitch livestream for the game featuring streamer Frank &quot;Techniq&quot; Ellerbe and Marvel&#x27;s Avengers lead designer Brian Waggoner. 


In an off-the-cuff comment, Ellerbe claimed his acting coach was actually the voice of She-Hulk in the game, to the obvious surprise of Waggoner - who stated that the character had not yet been officially confirmed.

Naka posted the photo on Twitter for the game&#x27;s 26th anniversary, but Ohshima has been edited out of the image.


Why? It all relates to controversy where Naka was removed as director from Balan Wonderworld, a game he worked on with Ohshima.

                              <span>Rockstar Games had plans to release a remaster of both Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 4, a new report has claimed. 
However, in light of the pretty poor reception following its GTA trilogy release last year (yes, I am being generous here), the company has now apparently put these ideas to one side.
Sources with knowledge of Rockstar&#x27;s inner workings have now confirmed to Kotaku that recent rumours to this effect were indeed true, and we were meant to be getting a shiny new upgrade for both games. Last year&#x27;s release of the GTA trilogy came as a real blow to Rockstar, however, and now the company is hoping to put all of that bad press behind it.

                              <span>After a three-year hiatus due to Covid, Pokémon Go&#x27;s in-person Go Fests have properly returned. The first of three music festival-sized city gatherings took place this weekend in Berlin and went off smoothly, with the usual mix of rare creatures, boosted Shiny chances and early access to new species.


As ever, it was the feeling of playing Pokémon Go among thousands of others that made the event something special. Along the many pretty paths circling Berlin&#x27;s beautiful Britzer Garden, thousands of Pokémon players plodded along in groups, with friends or in couples, celebrating rare catches or looking on in envy. 


I wasn&#x27;t certain about Berlin as a choice for Go Fest, after the smaller German city of Dortmund hosted the game&#x27;s main European events in previous years so successfully. Not only did Dortmund have a great city park to play in, but its main centre was small enough that when Pokémon Go players turned up, they absolutely took over - fans flooding its small squares and filling restaurant terraces. It created a carnival atmosphere, and seeing the expressions of bemused locals as dozens of people passed by in Pikachu onesies never got old.

                              <span>A speedrunner from the recent Summer Games Done Quick 2022 event has admitted he faked part of his run.


Russian speedrunner Mekarazium completed a live run of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance as one of a handful of online (rather than in-person) runs.


However, an extra run of the game&#x27;s Blade Wolf DLC was offered as a charity donation goal incentive, but Mekarazium has since admitted this run was faked using pre-recorded footage, as PCGamesN reported.

                              <span>We will no longer be getting any Xbox 360 games included with Games with Gold as of this October. 
This is due to the fact that Microsoft has now &quot;reached the limit of [its] ability&quot; for adding new Xbox 360 games to the service, Microsoft stated in an email to customers seen by Eurogamer. 
All is not lost though, as we will still be getting the usual monthly offering of Xbox One games.

&quot;Squid Research Lab here with a meaty discovery - this is rare imagery of a new multiplayer stage,&quot; the Splatoon team tweeted. 
&quot;The facility was made FROM scrap metal in order to make MORE scrap metal. Also, there was a sea here that evaporated. Surely unrelated to heavy industry [ahem]!&quot;

                              <span>A new study has forecast how the video games industry will perform over the course of 2022, and suggests a year-on-year decline following a strong period of growth. 


The sale of games, consoles and subscription services contributed to a enormous $191bn global total in 2021, which will fall slightly to $188bn this year, according to Ampere Analysis. 


This follows extraordinary growth through the early stages of the pandemic, with a leap in spending especially noticable from 2020 onwards.

While there have been no official announcements made as yet, publisher Annapurna Interactive does have its 2022 showcase scheduled for later this month.

Job adverts for a Destiny project were previously spotted last year by The Game Post. Required skills included a &quot;willingness to travel to China&quot; on a regular basis, and host Chinese partner teams. 

NetEase invested $100m in Bungie back in 2018, though the companies have never officially confirmed what the two are working on.

However, the powers that be at Ubisoft Mainz, developer of Anno 2070 are not going to let this hinder their game. Oh no sir.

The team behind the city-building and economic simulation game will now &quot;dedicate some of [its] development resources to work on upgrading Anno 2070&#x27;s aged online services infrastructure to a new system&quot;.

Release platforms are yet to be announced, though the original game arrived for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 back in 2012. 


As teased last month, this return is being overseen by Yoshimi Yasuda, the original game&#x27;s executive producer, as part of his new company Dragami Games.

In addition to this, the company also revealed that Monster Hunter Rise itself has also passed 10m units sold since its release.
Capcom equates these figures to &quot;a variety of measures including ongoing free updates and the launch of a PC version, as well as with the release of a set that includes Sunbreak.&quot;

Ahead of The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s release for the PS5 (and eventually PC), content creator Speclizer has revisited the first game in Naughty Dog&#x27;s post-apocalyptic world.


They have since shared a compilation of the incredible inclusions from Naughty Dog, many of which can be easily missed on your average playthrough. I am talking about things like Joel&#x27;s buttons being embossed with the words &quot;Naughty Button&quot; or being able to spot Tess&#x27; bite before she reveals her infection.

                              <span>Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End&#x27;s Madagascan jeep chase almost featured a stunt made famous during Sean Connery&#x27;s sixth outing as James Bond (I mean, why not, Drake does look pretty sharp in a dinner jacket after all).
The stunt in question comes from the 1971 film Diamonds are Forever, where Sean Connery&#x27;s Bond tips his vehicle onto two wheels to get through a tight gap (something those in pursuit are, of course, unable to pull off). 
&quot;We actually prototyped doing that [during A Thief&#x27;s End&#x27;s jeep chase],&quot; Uncharted 4&#x27;s co-lead designer Kurt Margenau reflected during a recent chat with Couch Soup. However, as those who have played the game will know, this idea did not ultimately make the final cut.

                              <span>This weekend&#x27;s major Call of Duty leak points to a Gulf War-era setting for the next Black Ops, fans have said.


The huge cache of leaked information - apparently gleaned from the files of a Warzone Mobile alpha build - detailed elements from several upcoming games, including the next release from Black Ops studio Treyarch, due in 2024.


Details were posted to Twitter by user RealiityUK, whose account has now been suspended, though a description of what was posted remains on reddit.

                              <span>itch.io has launched a new charity bundle to raise money for abortion funds.


The bundle is in direct response to the overturning of Roe v Wade, key US legislation that grants individuals the right to an abortion. 


The bundle contains over 750 games from over 600 creators available for a minimum donation of $10. Estimated value is over $3k.

                              <span>The modders behind Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition have finally fixed a 20-year-old bug that&#x27;s plagued the PC version of the game.


Previously, an infamous bug when playing on a PC with a multicore processor (as most modern PCs have) would cause the audio to skip and the game to crash, making it all but unplayable.


Now, the creators of the Enhanced Edition have fixed the issue by implementing a custom streaming audio engine.

                              <span>Minecraft maker Mojang has paid tribute to YouTuber Technoblade, whose death from cancer was announced last week. 


Technoblade, real name Alex, had amassed 13 million followers over years of creating Minecraft content. He was just 23.


His passing prompted an outpouring of messages from fellow streamers and esports players, as well as acknowledgement from Mojang itself. Now, the developer has gone further and updated Minecraft Java Edition&#x27;s launch screen with a nod to Technoblade&#x27;s YouTube icon - a crowned Minecraft pig.

Six parties say they will support the motion, which would bring Dutch law largely in line with Belgium - where loot boxes were outlawed back in 2018 (thanks, Neowin).


The motion describes loot boxes as &quot;a form of gambling&quot; and states &quot;children in video games are manipulated to purchase&quot; such items via in-game microtransactions.

At the time of release on PC in January this year, the game had a concurrent player count of 134,262; now that&#x27;s close to doubling at 231,360 - and it continues to rise.


Sunbreak is a huge new expansion to the game, adding master rank hunts, a plethora of new items, and returning monsters to defeat.

First debuted at the Anime Expo 2022 in Los Angeles, these opening credits are accompanied by Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s &#x27;This Fffire&#x27; from 2004. (A small spot of trivia for your next pub quiz, this is not the only piece of game-inspired media to feature this song. The earlier released and self-produced &#x27;This Fire&#x27; can also be found on the soundtrack from Burnout 3: Takedown.)
Anyway, I digress. Back to Edgerunners, and its new credit sequence which you can check out for yourself below.

The ARPG will debut on PS4 on 31st August, six years after it arrived on PS4 in Japan and over a year later than it arrived in the West on Xbox and PC. 

Like the versions on other consoles, it will be cross-platform compatible and free-to-play, and carry the &quot;New Genesis&quot; sub-title with fully localised text and character voices in English (thanks, Polygon).

                              <span>Bandai Namco has dropped a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming tactical battler, Digimon Survive, which finally releases on 29th July, 2022. 

Digimon Survive - which &quot;blends visual novel storytelling with tactical battle elements&quot; - has been a long time coming, having been formally delayed three times to &quot;allocate more time to development&quot; and &quot;enhance the quality of the game&quot;.

Featuring over 100 Digimon, this latest game in the Digimon series features a world map that is divided into areas and locations which you will need to scan in order to find  &quot;glitches&quot; for clues and items.

As spotted by ResetEra, Twitter user @RealiityUK - although they&#x27;ve had other accounts taken offline by DMCA strikes - shared the images over the weekend, posting a full thread of what seem to be loading screens from the shooter which they say were discovered in Warzone Mobile test files. 

If true, they show that the multiplayer upcoming maps from Modern Warfare 2 will include a Grand Prix, an oil field, and a museum, as well as others called Codename: SABA, and Hydro.

Whilst the singleplayer features for these games will mostly be unaffected, multiplayer modes or online features may be unavailable after 1st September, along with the ability to buy DLC.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Santa Monica Studio has now issued a formal statement asking that all players treat its developers &quot;with respect&quot;.

As Victoria so perfectly summarised for us at the time, yesterday was a sad day. In less than 24 hours, we got the news that Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert was no longer going to talk about the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island following online abuse, and God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s producer had to ask everyone to remain patient while waiting for more news on the game after we learned that some members of the God of War Ragnarök team were receiving unsolicited pictures of their private parts. 

Consequently, Santa Monica Studio today issued a formal statement about the incident via its social media channels.

                              <span>Two developers that had been working on a Fallout mod have been offered jobs by Bethesda.

In a statement posted on Twitter, the lead technical adviser and project manager of Fallout: London, a &quot;DLC-sized&quot; mod for Fallout 4, have both been offered jobs; the former as an associate level designer, and the latter a chance to work on Fallout 76. 

Ryan Johnson took up the new job as an associate level designer, albeit only after ensuring his &quot;expected level design tasks&quot; for the mod were complete and succession planning was in place. Dean Carter, however, decided not to take the Fallout 76 position as they wanted to &quot;continue working [on] Fallout: London until the end&quot;.

In a blog celebrating the studio&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the team said that whilst it was &quot;proud to look back on the legacy of characters and stories&quot; it had created, it is now focused &quot;on [its] current project&quot;.

&quot;As we approach 25 years since Sucker Punch first opened, we’re proud to look back on the legacy of characters and stories we’ve created, from Rocket: Robot on Wheels to Sly Cooper and infamous, and most recently Ghost of Tsushima,&quot; the developer said in a blog post.

That&#x27;s according to the website Playing for the Planet, an UN-led initiative which seeks to use games to &quot;inspire young people to learn and act in support of the environment&quot;.

For instance, for Riders Republic, Ubisoft says it will host a &quot;short and intense&quot; in-game event in Phoenix which will promote &quot;strategies to reduce wildfire frequency and size as well as have an emotional impact on players regarding the consequences of wildfires&quot;.

                              <span>The Quarry&#x27;s community has come up with a way for players to get hold of the Hard Pass accolade across platforms, something that was seemingly unobtainable due to a known issue.
Publisher 2K revealed last month that there was an issue &quot;causing the Hard Pass achievement/trophy to not be rewarded as intended&quot;. The team is looking to get this sorted in an upcoming patch, but until then, players looking to get this award can trick the game into working as it should.

                              <span>The next patch for Final Fantasy 14 will include a new Island Sanctuary farming sim mode.


Revealed in today&#x27;s Letter from the Producer stream, the new mode will be &quot;relaxing solo content&quot; that allows players to gather resources, care for creatures, build facilities, and earn special currency to purchase items.


Patch 6.2 will be called Buried Memory and is set for release in late August 2022.

The changes were revealed in a new Twitch Patch Notes stream that detailed forthcoming features.


The tag system will soon be updated so that streamers can create custom tags. What&#x27;s more, the maximum limit will increase from five to 10.

                              <span>Yesterday was a sad day in the gaming industry. In less than 24 hours, we got the news that Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert was no longer going to talk about the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island following online abuse, and God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s producer had to ask everyone to remain patient while waiting for more news on the game.
It has since transpired that some members of the gaming community have even been sending unsolicited pictures of their private parts to members of the God of War Ragnarök team. They somehow believed that this would suddenly make Sony Santa Monica give the world an update on the game&#x27;s release date... How they came to this conclusion is beyond me.
Since all of this has happened, prominent members from the industry have been making their voices heard and have called out the toxic behaviour of these so-called fans.

Campfire, as it&#x27;s known, will allow users to find other players in local communities, make friends, and send group messages.


In the absence of social features in its games, Campfire will act as a companion app.

                              <span>Cult classic cel-shaded shooter XIII was famously remade, and subsequently widely panned, in 2020. However, the remake is getting a second chance, as it is now being basically remade again.
A new statement on the game’s Steam page reads: &quot;To achieve the quality standards and offer an optimal gaming experience, Microids decided to entrust the development of XIII Remake to the French studio Tower Five (Lornsword: Winter Chronicle). Hard at work for more than a year on a major update. This update will be released on September 13th.
&quot;On that date, owners of the game will receive a free update and enjoy the game as intended. The development studio reworked the entire game from the Art Direction to the AI and added numerous technical improvements&quot; (via Kotaku).

During the meeting, which took place on Tuesday, the shareholder asked Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa if the company would consider making new games or remakes of its dormant series, specifically F-Zero.


As translated by VGC, Furukawa replied: &quot;It is realistically difficult to develop new titles and remakes, including sequels, for every Nintendo game that people request, but we are very grateful and appreciate the expectations our fans have for our games.&quot;

                              <span>GOG has reinstated Blade Runner: ScummVM edition following a fan outcry.


Last month, Nightdive Studios released its critically-panned remaster of Westwood Studios&#x27; classic point-and-click adventure, delisting the popular fan-made effort in the process.


While buying the Enhanced Edition from GOG also got you the original version, fans slammed the troubled remaster in user reviews, giving it an overall rating of 1.5 stars out of five.

                              <span>Konami has secured Inter Milan as an eFootball exclusive team from July 2024.


In a note to press, Konami said Inter Milan will feature exclusively within eFootball &quot;and no other video game&quot; from July 2024.


That means Inter Milan won&#x27;t be in that year&#x27;s EA Sports FC (EA will ditch the FIFA brand from 2023).

                              <span>Wired is reporting on a new remote-access Trojan that is able to infect at least eighty different targets:
So far, researchers from Lumen Technologies’ Black Lotus Labs say they’ve identified at least 80 targets infected by the stealthy malware, including routers made by Cisco, Netgear, Asus, and DrayTek. Dubbed ZuoRAT, the remote access Trojan is part of a broader hacking campaign that has existed since at least the fourth quarter of 2020 and continues to operate.
The discovery of custom-built malware written for the MIPS architecture and compiled for small-office and home-office routers is significant, particularly given its range of capabilities. Its ability to enumerate all devices connected to an infected router and collect the DNS lookups and network traffic they send and receive and remain undetected is the hallmark of a highly sophisticated threat actor...</span>

                              <span>Maxis continues to tick those much-requested Sims 4 features off the list as fans wait impatiently for news of the Sims 5, with the developer having now confirmed it&#x27;ll finally be giving teen Sims a proper education in its newly announced High School Years Expansion Pack, due 28th July.


High School Years, which follows the release of The Sim 4&#x27;s excellent Werewolves Game Pack earlier this month, does pretty much exactly what you&#x27;d assume it does based on its name, giving players the option to send teenage Sims off to Copperdale High for a few years of learning and post-class socialising with peers.


Its first big addition is the new location of Copperdale. Nestled on the banks of Lake LaSuli, this small town plays home to more than just the local high school; it also incorporates a library, the principal&#x27;s lavish mansion, a thrift store/boba hangout known as ThrifTea, and an amusement park, complete with haunted house, tunnel of love, ferris wheel, and photo booth.

                              <span>Earlier this week, news broke of a modder that hacked AMD&#x27;s FSR 2.0 temporal upscaling technology into Cyberpunk 2077, allowing users of non-RTX graphics cards the chance to play the game at higher frame-rates with substantially better visual quality than with FSR 1.0 upscaling. That&#x27;s massive for owners of AMD GPUs, and the mod even works beautifully on Steam Deck. 
We contacted the mod&#x27;s creator, the gloriously named PotatoOfDoom1337, to find out exactly how it works - and whether it means that FSR 2.0 will soon be available in a tonne of existing games. Here&#x27;s the interview, edited lightly for clarity. Enjoy!

What&#x27;s your background in programming and game modding? On NexusMods, it looks like you&#x27;ve only been creating mods since April last year?

                              <span>It looks like Sega is eyeing up Atlus games for potential live-action film and TV adaptations.


That means we could see the likes of Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Catherine following in the footsteps of Sonic the Hedgehog and his recent film success.

IGN reports that for Sega, expanding storytelling forms is a new and important part of its business strategy.

                              <span>Arkane and Bethesda have given us all a bite sized teaser highlighting the thrills and bloody spills that are coming our way in Redfall. 
&quot;The town of Redfall is under siege by a legion of vampires who have cut the island off from the outside world,&quot; the description reads. &quot;Trapped with a handful of survivors, choose from a roster of heroes to create the perfect team of vampire slayers and take back Redfall.&quot;
Said heroes are Layla Ellison (the &quot;telekinetic threat student in debt), Devinder &quot;Dev&quot; Crousley (the &quot;verified cryptid hunter&quot;), Jacob Boyer (the &quot;deadeye with an undead eye&quot;) and Remi de la Rosa (the &quot;ingenious ingeniera&quot;). You can check out the new trailer below.

                              <span>Kirby and the Forgotten Land was a colourful and welcome splash of fun on its release in March. One of its most adorable features (of which there are many) was the ever-evolving Waddle Dee Town, which has its own café. 
At this café, you can purchase a selection of eats to help Kirby on his quest to free the Waddle Dees, including the Car-Mouth Cake. This cake will cost Kirby 20 coins and will recover some health. But, let&#x27;s be honest, its reviving properties are not what we really love about it. What we really love is the fact that it is an adorable, edible Carby.
Now, the Kirby Café in Tokyo and Hakata in Japan has updated its menus to include a real Car-Mouth Cake for us to enjoy (I mean, if we are ever in the area).

                              <span>A character from Night in the Woods has been used as an unlikely Pride symbol at a football match in America.


At a Portland Timbers match, the crowd held up banners stating &quot;From Stonewall a brick and Portland an axe&quot; and &quot;Respect our pride or expect our wrath&quot;.


Then a third banner arose from the crowd: Mae Borowski, the anthropomorphic cat from Night in the Woods.

                              <span>Video game companies in Québec will be impacted by a new controversial language law.


The aim of Bill 96 is to strengthen the French-speaking province&#x27;s language laws, ensuring French is the main language spoken in everything from business to healthcare.


However, it&#x27;s feared this will drive away non-French speakers from Québec&#x27;s considerable video game industry.

                              <span>Valve has downplayed the performance impact of using slower SSDs in new shipments of the Steam Deck. 


The change was first spotted by German publication HardwareLuxx, which noticed the 256 GB and 512 GB versions of the Steam Deck now ship with either a two-lane or four-lane PCIe Gen 3 SSD. Previously, these versions all came with a faster four-lane SSD. 


Asked by PC Gamer for comment, Valve&#x27;s product designer Lawrence Yang said Valve &quot;determined  that there is no impact to performance between the two models,&quot; and there were only differences between the two drives in &quot;extremely uncommon cases.&quot;

He went on to defend the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island, Gilbert&#x27;s first return to the series since 1991&#x27;s LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge.

The original Overwatch wasn&#x27;t updated to natively support the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, so there&#x27;s huge expectation that the sequel will bring the latest and greatest tech features.


Beta players have reported that the game will be able to run at 120 FPS with variable refresh rate (VRR) support. That&#x27;s a huge upgrade for console players who have been locked to 60 FPS on last-gen consoles.

The picture came from Bit Planet Games, the developer of Ultrawings and its follow up Ultrawings 2. It showed the PS VR2 on a black leather chair.
It wasn&#x27;t much, with the set not even being in use for the photo, but it was enough to quickly catch the ever-watching eyes of the internet before the developer had a chance to remove the post without anyone noticing it. You can see it for yourself below (via Reddit).

That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which has shared portions of an email sent to Niantic staff by the company&#x27;s chief executive officer John Hanke.
In the message, Hanke is said to have blamed today&#x27;s project cancellations and redundancies - which will affect around 8% of Niantic&#x27;s workforce - on the company facing &quot;a time of economic turmoil&quot;. Hanke reportedly claimed the moves would help &quot;further streamline our operations in order to best position the company to weather any economic storms that may lie ahead.&quot;

                              <span>RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios&#x27; widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, will finally be making the jump to consoles - some three and a half years after its full PC release - on 29th July.


RimWorld has, of course, made quite the mark on PC since its early access arrival all the way back in 2013 - partly for its wonderfully rich blend of management sim action and procedural storytelling, but equally for the way its complex systems can quickly tumble into outright debauchery, ranging from drug-fuelled cannibalism to non-consensual body harvesting.


Word that a console version of RimWorld was finally on the way arrived in March, although notably not through official channels. Instead, the port - being handled by Double Eleven Limited, which has previously helped port the likes of Minecraft Dungeons and Rust to consoles - hit headlines when it was listed as having been refused classification in Australia.

Tri-Ace, the studio that&#x27;s been at the helm of the Star Ocean series since its debut in 1996, is once again handling development duties on The Divine Force, which this time follows the stories of dual protagonists Raymond, the captain of the space trading ship Ydas, and Laeticia, the princess-knight of a kingdom on the underdeveloped planet of Aster IV.


Each character offers its own story perspectives and gameplay experiences, and there&#x27;s a taste of Star Ocean: The Divine Force&#x27;s ensuing action in the new trailer accompanying today&#x27;s news.

                              <span>Ubisoft has today unveiled a feast of fresh Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope gameplay footage, showcasing its intriguing new settings, characters and chaos.


This sequel to the excellent Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle takes place in a &quot;whimsical&quot; and gorgeous new galaxy, that&#x27;s a curious blend of both Mario Galaxy and Rabbids universes. Within its orbit float worlds of autumnal colour, frozen snow and sandy beaches, like a Mario Galaxy game in miniature.


The story here revolves around Cursa, a dark entity that wants to absorb this hybrid galaxy&#x27;s energy and capture the Sparks - cute creations that are a mix of Galaxy&#x27;s Lumas and the Rabbids. It&#x27;s up to Mario and his Kingdom Battle crew to save the day, now aided by Rabbid Rosalina, the punky-looking rabbid Edge, and - as we found out yesterday during the latest Nintendo Direct - Bowser himself.

The first discovery came from self-proclaimed &quot;Switch tinkerer&quot; OatmealDome. In this case, the modder managed to unearth some Half-Life 2 content tucked away in the Portal: Companion Collection&#x27;s files.
&quot;The entirety of Half-Life 2 (minus maps and music) is present in the ROM,&quot; they wrote via Twitter. &quot;Likely based on the NVIDIA Shield port, with a little Xbox 360 sprinkled in.&quot;

Despite being out for several years, the Zelda community is still finding countless weird and wonderful ways to approach the game - the most recent of which being a completion of every shrine within the game without using any of the runes on the Sheikah Slate.
Content creator Limcube took on this challenge as part of an incredible 28-hour stream and used a variety of techniques to get to their final goal of 120/120 shrines completed.

However, at the time of writing, no further details have been given about what role any of the actors will play on the show&#x27;s release (via Variety). 
MacLachlan is probably best known for his role of Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks, as well as Trey MacDougal in Sex and the City and Orson Hodge in Desperate Housewives. For the fellow parents among us, he is also the voice of Riley&#x27;s father in the very good (and more than just a little bit emotional) Inside Out.

The allegation surfaced this week via a YouTube video from a channel named Upper Echelon Gamers. Titled &quot;What Made Cyberpunk 2077 Fail - Quantic Lab?&quot;, the 14-minute video claimed the QA studio had placed junior members of its team on the project instead of seasoned veterans, and flagged too many minor bugs. 


These issues, the video claimed, impacted Quantic Lab&#x27;s work and therefore the overall game.

                              <span>Spellbreak, the battle royale where everyone is a wizard, will shut down in 2023.


The game&#x27;s developer Proletariat confirmed Spellbreak&#x27;s end in a blog post today, and confirmed that servers will go dark early next year.


&quot;Breakers, after more than four years of elemental magic and spell combinations, we&#x27;ve made the decision to end development of Spellbreak,&quot; Proletariat wrote. &quot;Thank you to the millions of players who have joined us in the Hollow Lands since 2018; it&#x27;s been an amazing journey.&quot;

This is the second time the switch has now occured, after Pac-Mom previously took Ms Pac-Man&#x27;s place in Bandai Namco&#x27;s Arcade Archives: Pac-Land earlier this year.


Again, the reason for the swap seems to be the messy legal issues surrounding ownership of Ms Pac-Man, which are the subject of a 2019 lawsuit.

                              <span>The return of the Monkey Island series with the aptly named Return to Monkey Island was a welcome surprise when it was announced earlier this year (on April Fool&#x27;s Day no less). After all, we had not seen a new game with Guybrush Threepwood at the fore since 2009. 
However, while we are getting a return, this may not be the start of a new wave of games based in the sun-soaked Caribbean islands. Rather, this appears to be the last one of its kind. 
Following its new gameplay trailer yesterday (see above) and the news it will be coming to the Nintendo Switch as a console first, the Return to Monkey Island developers unveiled a new website for the game. It is a great site, with playful interactive options for fans of the series, including the chance to &#x27;chat&#x27; with series regular Stan.

Details dug up from an Xbox store listing point to Skull and Bones having the usual array of pre-order bonuses, as well as premium items for an edition including a soundtrack and artbook.


A release date - 8th November 2022 - was also spied, thanks to regular store watcher Aggiornamenti Lumia, and subsequently verified by serial leaker Tom Henderson.

                              <span>First impressions of Sonic Frontiers have, it&#x27;s fair to say, been mixed - but Sega is forging ahead regardless, now offering a look at the game&#x27;s rendition of Cyber Space, where more &quot;traditional, fast-paced&quot; Sonic stages can be found.


Revealed during today&#x27;s busy Nintendo Direct, Cyber Space is a mysterious digital realm that can be reached by uncovering ancient entrances around Starfall Islands - a cluster of landmasses incorporating Kronos Island, the lush area seen in Sonic Frontiers&#x27; divisive first trailers. 


In order to unlock the Cyber Space entrances, players will first need to earn Portal Gears by solving puzzles and completing challenges around the &quot;open zone&quot; map. Once in Cyber Space, they can try their hand at &quot;traditional, fast-paced, speed running action platforming&quot; - linear stages more in line with classic Sonic action - earning Vault Keys required to progress further.

                              <span>As we ready to catapult with full enthusiasm into summer, Microsoft has announced July&#x27;s Xbox Games with Gold, this time giving subscribers on  Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S access to Torchlight, Thrillville: Off the Rails, Beast of Maravilla Island, and Relicta.


It&#x27;s not exactly a blockbuster line-up then, but there&#x27;s certainly some fun to be had. Developer Runic Games&#x27; Torchlight, for instance, is an enjoyable Diablo-esque dungeon-crawler from 2009. This isn&#x27;t the first time it&#x27;s appeared as part of Xbox Games with Gold though (it was last available in July 2019), so it&#x27;s entirely possible this one is already hanging around your library.


Thrillville: Off the Rails, meanwhile, is the 2007 sequel to Frontier Developments&#x27; Thrillville, an attempt at creating a more accessible spin on the classic theme park sim genre. &quot;It&#x27;s not complex, it&#x27;s not challenging, but it&#x27;s not trying to be,&quot; said Eurogamer in its review. &quot;It&#x27;s an enjoyable family game which also has appeal for retro gaming fans and drunk people.&quot;

As with other Niantic apps, the game is designed to encourage and reward players for getting off their sofa and out into their local area. 


You can pre-register for the game now ahead of it launching &quot;soon&quot; via a beta in certain countries, during which time the game will be tested and improved upon.

                              <span>A new trailer for Gotham Knights (the game, not the TV show) puts the spotlight firmly on Robin.
&quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine a Robin without a Batman,&quot; muses the masked hero, before resolving that he will figure it all out. What then unfolds is a bombastic trailer with Robin showing off his athletic prowess. This includes his various attacks and how he can use &quot;teleportation tech from the Justice League&#x27;s satellite&quot; to &quot;zap [himself] short distances in a fight&quot;.
You can check out this latest spot from Warner Bros. Games below.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct highlighted an arry of third-party games coming to Nintendo Switch through the rest of this year and beyond. As expected, the showcase focused on games made by non-Nintendo companies - but there were still plenty of highlights, and several exclusives.


The show kicked off with Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak, which launches this week. A title update with yet more monsters to slay arrives in August, and has the jazzy title of Seething Bazelgeuse. Oh, and there&#x27;s a demo available now.
Next was the venerable Nier Automata, PlatinumGames&#x27; acclaimed role-playing game from 2017. It&#x27;s now headed to Nintendo Switch via a fresh The End of YoRHa Edition which contains previous DLC and new costumes. It launches on 6th October.

Return to Monkey Island is slated to release sometime this year, and come to consoles first via Nintendo Switch. We have been given some nice titbits of information about its upcoming release, including that it will be starting off at an amusement park (where Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge concluded), but the team has been keeping its cards close to its chest in terms of story and trailer reveals. Well, that was until now.
Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, gave us our first look at some of the game&#x27;s action, including piratical sword fights, explosive nautical combat, and what appears to be Guybrush in some kind of court (bodes well!). We also got to see some returning faces such as Elaine Marley, LeChuck, Murray the talking skull and Wally (to name but a few).

                              <span>Mega Man Battle Network, Capcom&#x27;s turn-based take on its iconic action series, is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PC next year. 


Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be bundling some 10 games in total, with a physical release offering the full set while the digital release will be split across two volumes. There&#x27;ll be extra features such as a music mode featuring some 150 songs and an art gallery containing some 1000 illustrations. 


The Mega Man Battle Network series had an extremely prolific run from 2001 to 2009 on the Game Boy Advance, and was well-received even if it was often hard to distinguish individual titles. There&#x27;s no release date set for Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection beyond a vague 2023 window.

&quot;Fallout: London is a DLC-sized mod for Bethesda&#x27;s Fallout 4. As a continuation of the base game, the mod will allow the player to visit the previously unexplored post-apocalyptic environment of London,&quot; the description explains. 
This mod will be a change from the rest of the Fallout series, as it will not take place in America. The developer hopes this will allow for users to explore &quot;new cultures which have not homogenised with their American counterparts&quot;. It will also mean that players can dive on into &quot;pre-war European history, and the effects the Resource Wars had on the class structured society of pre-war Britain.&quot;

The aim is to shake up the current &quot;meta&quot; and re-balance the game, forcing players to consider new tactics and strategies.


The changes will be added in the forthcoming mid-chapter update for Chapter 24: Roots of Dread - that hits the public test build on 29th June and will be fully implemented in July.

                              <span>Skyrim has been around for quite the time, with many a new edition or various mod upgrades being made available in its 10 plus years on the market. However, we now also have a mod that covers any version of Skyrim that releases even further down the line (which, let&#x27;s be honest, will likely happen).
The mod in question comes from Nexus Mods user xilamonstrr and brings Skyrim&#x27;s big scaly dragons into super sharp focus. I am talking about seeing all the little details, right down to each beast&#x27;s scars, in much, much, higher definition. 
And, while 16k may seem a touch excessive given that most games tend to opt for 1440p, xilamonstrr has a good reason for choosing this resolution. In short, the dragons in Skyrim are huge, and therefore their textures can get stretched more than the other enemies and entities in this world.

                              <span>Ubisoft briefly published a 20th October release date for its promising-looking Nintendo Switch sequel Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. 


The company has yet to officially trumpet the date, but it was live for a while on Ubisoft&#x27;s store (thanks, Gematsu) ahead of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, which is scheduled for 2pm UK time. 


Today&#x27;s announcement stream is set to feature third-party games for Nintendo Switch - of which Sparks of Hope is a prime example. It seems likely we&#x27;ll see this made official then.

                              <span>Ubisoft has said it will attend Gamescom 2022 - a show many other companies have said they will skip.


A brief message posted to Ubisoft&#x27;s Twitter last night revealed the publisher would be present at this August&#x27;s Cologne-based convention, though did not detail what games might be on offer.


Ubisoft&#x27;s decision comes after the recent pull-outs from Sony, Nintendo, Activision Blizzard and Take-Two, which have all chosen not to attend. Microsoft has yet to make an announcement - though it&#x27;s unclear what it might bring.

                              <span>Developer Nightdive Studios has announced that its critically panned remaster of Westwood Studios&#x27; classic point-and-click adventure Blade Runner will now include the well-recieved ScummVM version of the original game on Steam.


Nightdive&#x27;s remaster was announced back in March 2020, but the project appeared to be on a permanent hiatus after the studio told Eurogamer it was struggling to overcome certain &quot;obstacles&quot;. It was a bit of a surprise, then, when Nightdive&#x27;s long-awaited Enhanced Edition of Blade Runner resurfaced earlier this month with a 23rd June release date, but perhaps less of a surprise, given its history, when the remaster launched to less-than-stellar reviews.


For those that purchased the game via GOG, there was some respite in that all copies of the remaster came with the previously available ScummVM version, developed by a dedicated group of enthusiasts. Steam purchasers, however, were stuck with Nightdive&#x27;s inferior remaster - until today, that is, when the studio revealed it would adding the ScummVM version as an alternative download for all purchases.

                              <span>Whispers of a Metroid Prime remaster for Switch have been circulating for quite some time, but a new report has claimed Nintendo is finally almost ready to share the fruits of its labour, and will be releasing the long-rumoured game at the end of this year.


That&#x27;s according to the persistently leaky Jeff Grubb, who shared the news on Giant Bomb&#x27;s Game Mess Mornings show, saying he&#x27;d been told &quot;pretty definitively&quot; that an updated version of Metroid Prime 1 - what he referred to as Metroid Prime Remastered - was set to be one of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;big holiday games&quot; for 2022.


&quot;In the past, this is something I&#x27;d heard was in the works,&quot; Grubb explained, &quot;they have things happening with that game. Now I’ve been told that their plans are to release that game this holiday - I think almost certainly to line up with the 20th anniversary in November.&quot;

                              <span>Following Fall Guys&#x27; successful, if slightly controversial, switch to free-to-play last week, developer Mediatonic has been plugging away to fix any launch week woes, and those continuing efforts have now manifested in a new patch which, among other things, should now enable PS5 players to get into games while in parties.
Beyond that headline fix, and tweaks to resolve a seperate bug preventing players from hearing party members in voice chat, Mediatonic&#x27;s latest patch notes suggest an update primarily targeting smaller issues across all versions of the game, rather than anything particularly seismic, with other fixes including a range of visual issues on Switch. Here&#x27;s the full list of tweaks and adjustments, for the curious, as per the Fall Guys Twitter account:
Fall Guys&#x27; transition to a free-to-pay model seems to have paid off for Mediatonic. Despite some server wobbles on launch day, the developer reported Fall Guy&#x27;s new monetisation model - combined with its launch on two new platforms in Xbox and Switch - managed to push the game&#x27;s player base over the 20m mark just 24 hours after its free-to-play release.

As spotted by Push Square, you are now able to purchase a gift card for £84&#x27;s worth of PS Store credit from outlets such as Amazon UK. This is the annual cost to sign up for PlayStation&#x27;s new PS Plus Extra tier. 
Similarly, you can buy a voucher for £100, and that would cover someone&#x27;s Premium subscription for 12 months.

                              <span>Work has begun again on an eye-catching fan remake of cult classic The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run - now with a round of impressive new features.


A fresh video detailing work on the project has revealed the remake&#x27;s newly-stitched-together open world, and promises further additions in future - such as improvements to the game&#x27;s vehicles, the addition of online multiplayer, a quest system and revamped graphics. 


The project&#x27;s re-emergence now is a little surprising, since an earlier version was previously pulled offline from creator Reuben &quot;Reubs&quot; Ward&#x27;s Patreon to avoid getting into any potential legal issues.

                              <span>Fntastic, the developer of Steam&#x27;s most-wishlisted upcoming title The Day Before, has spoken to Eurogamer about its decision to ask for volunteers to help work on the recently-delayed game.
The studio&#x27;s website states that Fntastic&#x27;s &quot;culture&quot; is &quot;based on the idea of volunteering&quot; and, as such, &quot;every Fntastic member is a volunteer&quot; - paid or not (thanks, Well Played). 
These types of &quot;volunteers&quot; are divided into two categories: full-time and part-time. A full-time volunteer is apparently paid a salary, while a part-time volunteer is expected to take part in &quot;various activities ranging from translating to community moderating&quot;. Writes Fntastic: &quot;Part-time volunteers also can offer their unique skills to improve our projects or create new special features.&quot;

The company, which specialises in artificial intelligence, has developed a video pre-training (VPT) algorithm that allows its AI to learn through viewing.


Unlike previous attempts at creating Minecraft algorithms, OpenAI&#x27;s plays in the same environment as humans using the equivalent of mouse and keyboard actions, making this a huge leap in AI technology.

                              <span>Finally, we have a proper Nintendo Direct set in the schedule for tomorrow. Tune in at 2pm UK time for an announcement show lasting 25 minutes, focused on third-party games. 


Expect a look at Switch games made by companies other than Nintendo - so, no hoping for Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 news here. 


A previous rumour with word of tomorrow&#x27;s showcase suggested we&#x27;d see the Persona franchise represented, as well as the possibility of Red Dead Redemption 2.

The record was set during his La Velada Del Año II boxing event at the weekend that featured multiple content creators in the ring.


The previous record was set by TheGrefg at 2.5m concurrent viewers.

                              <span>Death Stranding&#x27;s Hideo Kojima has revealed he was once cooking up a project similar to Amazon&#x27;s superhero series The Boys. 
&quot;I quit after three episodes of season one,&quot; Kojima wrote on Twitter, discussing the series. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d watch the rest of the show. Actually, I watched a few episodes that were delivered at the time when I was about to start a project that I had been warming up for a long time and put it on hold because the concept was similar (different settings and tricks).&quot;
Kojima went on to state his project would have been a &quot;buddy (male/female) thing with a special detective squad facing off against legendary heroes behind the scenes.&quot; As well as this, Kojima had none other than Hannibal&#x27;s Mads Mikkelsen in mind as his leading man.

                              <span>The PC app for PlayStation Plus is displaying some titles incorrectly, making them inaccessible.


PlayStation Plus is available on PC and allows games to be streamed, but the library differs from the console version.


The main issue is that a number of PS1, 2, and 4 games are listed incorrectly as PS3 titles, which do not load at all when selected. Correctly labelled PS3 games do play as intended.

The detail comes from a 2003 issue of Nintendo Dream magazine, which popular YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming? has now translated.


Zelda series boss Eiji Aounuma was all set to use a theremin as Link&#x27;s musical instrument of choice, with each control stick on the GameCube pad set to control each of Link&#x27;s hands as he manipulated its volume and pitch.

                              <span>Valve designer Lawrence Yang has made a public plea to users, asking them not to mod their devices in a bid to increase the Steam Deck&#x27;s SSD to house a 2242 M.2 NVMe SSD, rather than the 2230 form factor SSD it comes with as standard.
In response to an article reporting one such way of doing this, Yang replied: &quot;Hi, please don&#x27;t do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved. In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for.&quot;
Yang finished by writing that, while the mod in question &quot;may appear to work&quot;, it will &quot;significantly shorten the life of your Deck&quot;. So, certainly something that is best avoided.

In return, Fortnite&#x27;s cheeky llama mascot will pop up in Dead by Daylight as a charm.

                              <span>Fall Guys players believe it&#x27;s now quicker to level up your battle pass if you lose rather than win.

That&#x27;s because of the game&#x27;s all new progression and monetisation systems that were introduced when the game switched to a free-to-play model earlier this week.

As spotted by Gamerant, players can still level up their battle pass, but with new daily, weekly, and long-term challenges also now available, it seems as though maximising those will help you progress faster than winning matches... and given the time it takes to secure a winning crown, you could potentially earn the same amount of Fame more quickly just by crashing out in early rounds.

                              <span>Skull &amp; Bones has been rated by the ERSB, leading some to hope that a release date may be imminent. 

The news follows rating board confirmations in other parts of the world, too, including Brazil and Australia, and a leak of Skull &amp; Bones&#x27; four-minute tutorial video back in April, which Ubisoft eventually confirmed was real.

The description shared on the ESRB website is the closest we&#x27;ve come to getting an idea of what the game - which is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox Series - entails since it underwent &quot;extensive reworking&quot; a couple of years back.

That&#x27;s according to Dealabs poster billbil-kun, who - as ever - has the scoop on what titles are next heading to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus free game line-up next month. 

Though we have to take this with the usual pinch of proverbial salt, billbil-kun has been ahead of Sony&#x27;s formal announcement many, many times now, and hasn&#x27;t been wrong thus far.

                              <span>Riot Games has confirmed that from 13th July, it will begin collecting &quot;in-game voice communications&quot; in North America in a bid to combat &quot;disruptive behaviour&quot;.

In a brief update on Valorant&#x27;s offical website, Riot Games explained that as part of its &quot;larger effort to combat disruptive behaviour&quot;, the company has updated its Privacy Notice and Terms of Service to allow recording and evaluation of in-game voice communications.

The post stresses that these recordings will only be evaluated when &quot;a report for [negative] behaviour is submitted&quot; and the system will originally kick off in Valorant before - once the &quot;tech [is] in a good enough place&quot; - it will be rolled out to other games.

                              <span>Former Sega of America president and founding member of Sony Computer Entertainment America, Bernie Stolar, has died aged 75 years old. 

According to GamesBeat, Stolar - whose career started in 1980 when he set up his own coin-op arcade company - died in California. He had always been a very candid and transparent executive who talked openly about his triumphs and mistakes over the years.

&quot;I loved working for Sony,&quot; Stolar once said, according to GB. &quot;I really did. But when the opportunity came up to go to Sega and help rebuild the business and come up with new hardware, I was very interested in doing it. I wouldn’t have left Sony if I hadn’t also lived in fear of getting fired along with everyone else, though.

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has outlined its plans on tackling cheating in the popular augmented-reality mobile game.

In an update posted to the company&#x27;s official blog (thanks, NME), Niantic said it is &quot;continuously work[ing] to facilitate a fun and fair environment&quot; and &quot;[felt players&#x27;] frustration about how cheating behaviours&quot; affected them. 

Its last post on cheating - posted way back last year - was &quot;focused primarily on sharing a broad overview&quot; on the topic, but since then, Niantic says it&#x27;s &quot;becoming better&quot; at spotting cheaters.

Whilst it&#x27;s &quot;mostly a modding-focused update&quot;, creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone says there &quot;will be some new content&quot;, but advised players to temper expectations, as it &quot;won&#x27;t be huge&quot;.

Asked if his follow-up game, Haunted Chocolatier, will have references to the wholesome farming sim, Barone said that there would be, but said he didn&#x27;t know &quot;how deep the connection will be&quot; as he&#x27;s keen for his upcoming title to &quot;have its own identity&quot;.

Nacho Requena - editor of Spanish games magazine, Manual - teased in a recent Twitch stream that new announcements - this time from major publishers about third-party games - is slated for this coming Tuesday, 28th June 2022.

&quot;We should have a Nintendo Direct this coming Tuesday,&quot; Requena reportedly said, as translated by VGC. &quot;This will be mainly focused on third-party games – that’s what I’ve been told to expect.

As spotted by Gematsu (thanks, PC Gamer), back in 2018, studio boss Hidetaka Miyazaki said that &quot;3.5&quot; of the games the team was currently working on were unannounced, and 4Gamer reached out to ask Miyazaki on their progress. 

Since that time, we&#x27;ve had Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, PSVR game, Déraciné, and Elden Ring, of course. That leaves just one mysterious game yet to be announced, which may or may not be that heavily-rumoured Armored Core instalment.

According to  Michsuzuki and spotted and translated by our friends at VGC, Square Enix&#x27;s CEO Yosuke Matsuda confirmed at the company&#x27;s recent Shareholders&#x27; Meeting that it was &quot;too early to make Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy blockchain games&quot;, emphasising that he was &quot;not thinking about that&quot; for upcoming releases. 

VGC also purports that the company is keen to create &quot;story-focused&quot; NFTs, too.

As demonstrated in yesterday&#x27;s announcement livestream, like its 90s predecessor, it&#x27;ll feature a throttle, stick, and the ability to suit both right- and left-handed players. 

The Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 itself will retail for around half the price of this newly-announced peripheral (thanks, Famitsu).

TryHardGuides.com (thanks, VGC) believes the publisher has plans to showcase the game sometime in the week commencing 4th July, intimating we may soon get a release date and more details about what the game entails.

&quot;Details on what will be revealed are vague, but it’s understood that Ubisoft will finally confirm a release date for the long-awaited title, officially reveal gameplay, and share some other additional details,&quot; the site says.

                              <span>Bungie and a number of PlayStation studios, including Insoniac and Sucker Punch, have spoken out in support of reproductive rights following today&#x27;s decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn key legislation granting individuals the constitutional right to choose an abortion - a move that gives US states the power to either severely restrict or ban the practice.


Bungie was one of the first studios to make a statement in May after the US Supreme Court&#x27;s plans to overthrow Roe v Wade were leaked to the press, calling the move a &quot;direct attack on human rights&quot;. Adding to that sentiment in a new statement shared today, it said, &quot;Standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values.&quot;


&quot;Last month, we stated without reservation that all of us deserve to choose our own path and access the healthcare we need,&quot; the developer continued. &quot;The decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade cuts off millions of Americans from that access and leaves open the possibility of even further restrictions on life-saving healthcare for all of us.&quot;

The former is set to leave the Extra catalogue on 5th July 2022 - although it&#x27;s been on PS Now since 1st March - while the latter will leave Premium on 19th July 2022.

Producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed to IGN that the dog is named Torgal and he may even be a party member.


&quot;Well, let&#x27;s just say he&#x27;s more wolf than dog - and his name is &#x27;Torgal&#x27;,&quot; said Yoshida. &quot;As for him being a party member, you&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. We&#x27;ll have more info on parties soon.&quot;

                              <span>Bungie is suing the perpetrator behind a series of fake Destiny 2 DMCA takedowns for $7.7m.


Earlier in March this year, a number of top Destiny 2 YouTubers - and even Bungie itself - were struck with a fake DMCA takedown from an unknown user.


Bungie has since identified and filed a lawsuit against the user, named Nicholas Minor a.k.a Lord Nazo.

And, of course, the company has not missed out on a golden opportunity to remind us all of its many IPs, from Horizon and Uncharted to Bloodborne, Ghost of Tsushima and more. 
The new trailer, which is simply called Mr. Malcom, takes us on a journey into a &quot;mystifying and intriguing world, showcasing the lives that anyone can live, through wonderful gaming experiences&quot;. It all starts off seemingly benign, with the titular Mr Malcom enjoying a meal out before buying himself some nice juicy meat from the butcher. 
However, it soon becomes more and more surreal, as Mr. Malcom makes his way home and back to his eclectic collection. Also, that meat I just mentioned... it wasn&#x27;t actually for him. You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

&quot;Actually, it was ready to be released in March, but at the same time, Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine made the world situation unstable,&quot; said Yoshida.

Players who wish to see another player banned due to misconduct will have to send a ban request to Mojang. This will need to include a valid reason for the request.

                              <span>Nightdive Studios has released its Enhanced Edition of Blade Runner on the GOG store, replacing the fan-created ScummVM version in the process.


This Enhanced Edition has been a long time coming, as previously reported, involving &quot;reconstruction and upressing of original Westwood VQA Videos&quot;.



However, it has replaced a fan-created version that&#x27;s now available only as an add-on, meaning it&#x27;s impossible to access without purchasing the Nightdive Studios edition first.

                              <span>Ubisoft has seen a fair amount of bad press and overall poor performance of late, a result of which has seen its chief executive taking a voluntary pay cut. 
A recent company filing revealed Yves Guillemot chose to forgo about a third of his annual compensation (via Axios), equating to a pay cut of €310k (approximately £266k / $327k). 
An Ubisoft spokesperson told Axios this was a &quot;personal decision by Yves Guillemot, which he took considering that the company had not reached the financial targets that it had publicly communicated to the markets&quot;.

                              <span>One of the developers of the recently released Sonic Origins has hit out at publisher Sega, alleging &quot;what is in Origins is also not what we turned in&quot;.

Simon &quot;Stealth&quot; Thomley, of Sonic Origins developer Headcannon, took to Twitter to accuse Sega of introducing &quot;wild bugs&quot; into the game. 


Headcannon was responsible for the well-received 2017 platformer Sonic Mania and assisted Sega with the development of Sonic Origins, which was released on multiple platforms this week.

The idea is that these new Spartan Points will take the place of the Season Points that currently exist in the game, and which allow players to purchase various cosmetics by completing challenges and the like.
Don&#x27;t worry unduly, however.

                              <span>Actor Chris Pratt has been discussing his - somewhat controversial - role in the upcoming CGI Super Mario Bros. movie, telling Variety that his take on the title character will be &quot;updated and unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world before.&quot;


Mario has, of course, been voiced by Charles Martinet since 1992, and his video game performance has become inseparable from Nintendo&#x27;s flagship character. As such, Mario fans were somewhat aghast last year when Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto announced Pratt would be replacing Martinet as the voice of Mario in the upcoming film.


It&#x27;s a casting decision that few seemed to have warmed to even ten months on, despite the best efforts of Chris Meledandri, producer of the Super Mario film, who insisted Pratt&#x27;s performance as Mario was &quot;phenomenal&quot; last November. Meledandri then defended his star again this week, saying criticism of Pratt&#x27;s casting would &quot;evaporate&quot; when people heard his performance.

                              <span>Four and a bit years after its initial launch, FTL developer Subset Games is revisiting its stellar turn-based strategy game Into the Breach, with a much-expanded Advanced Edition update for existing platforms that&#x27;s set to release on 19th July.


Into the Breach&#x27;s Advanced Edition update - which will be free to all existing owners on Switch, Mac, and PC - introduces new squads, weapons, pilots (with new pilot abilities), enemies, bosses, missions, and new music from Ben Prunty. It&#x27;ll also include a new, more challenging difficulty mode, plus support for seven new languages.


Alongside the update for existing platforms, Into the Breach will also be making its iOS and Android debut on 19th July. This version will include the new Advanced Edition content and touch-screen support, but will only be available to Netflix subscribers as part of the streaming service&#x27;s gradual move into gaming.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the majestic rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, is expanding again, this time introduing a huge number of new accessibility features, including an adjustable assist mode, in a PC and console update the studios are calling Breaking Barriers.


Evil Empire first discussed improving Dead Cells&#x27; accessibility back in January, when it began canvassing players for feedback on how it could expand the game to better suit a wide range of needs. It then shared an update on its progress in May, detailing some of the accessibility options that were on the way.


After a round of beta testing, all that work has now been moved to the live game with the official launch of Breaking Barriers. The update brings an huge range of new accessibility features - tested by a panel of players with various disabilities at AbleGamers - all of which have been detailed in a lengthy new blog post and nine-minute video breakdown.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - we look in detail at today&#x27;s final rollout of PlayStation Plus Premium, which is now available in the UK and mainland Europe.

We now know all of the games included in the PlayStation Plus Premium catalogue at launch and it&#x27;s enough to hit Sony&#x27;s promises, certainly, though there are still odd omissions. The lack of 60Hz for some PS1 games (for now) also points to a rather rushed release, despite the extra weeks we&#x27;ve waited on these shores.

So, what can Sony do to build on this launch and improve the new PlayStation Plus Premium further? And, after all that, have we ended up subscribing ourselves? Eurogamer&#x27;s Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

A cloud-only version will also be available for Nintendo Switch, and as previously announced the game will launch into Xbox Game Pass for Xbox, PC and cloud on day one.


Today also brings 10 minutes of newly-revealed gameplay, as siblings Amicia and Hugo return, happy to use their tricks to remove any soldiers in sight. It&#x27;s a nice showcase of the game&#x27;s stealthy combat, if nothing else, and yes - those rats are back.

It will light up in streaming once we&#x27;ve finished adding it.&quot;

As announced previously, Overwatch 2 will not contain any loot boxes, with items instead made available for purchase directly instead. 


Writing in a reddit AMA last night, Blizzard explained that any unopened loot boxes would be automatically redeemed ahead of Overwatch 2&#x27;s launch.

&quot;Does Sonic Origins Sonic 3 have a different song?&quot; he tweeted out of the blue. &quot;Oh my god, the music for Sonic 3 has changed, even though Sega Official uses Michael Jackson&#x27;s music.&quot;

                              <span>If an entire universe in the palm of your hand sounds neat, you&#x27;re probably already excited about the launch of exploratory space sim No Man&#x27;s Sky on Switch. And it turns out the wait for its arrival won&#x27;t go on too much longer, with developer Hello Games having now confirmed it&#x27;ll be coming to Nintendo&#x27;s console - initially as a single-player-only experience - on 7th October.


No Man&#x27;s Sky, of course, launched for PC and PS4 back in the summer of 2016, giving players an entire procedural universe to explore as their whims took them. That initial version memorably came in for some criticism, but Hello Games has continued to expand on the game&#x27;s solid survival core since then, delivering over 19, often significant, free updates.


These have introduced the likes of base building, bobbleheads, farming, giant customisable space freighters, land and water vehicles, pilotable mechs, living ships, alien-infested space derelicts, new flora and fauna, pets, live-service-style community expeditions, music tools, sand worms, and more - all of which should be included at launch on Switch.

                              <span>A new boardgame set in Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s dystopian world of Night City recently launched on Kickstarter, and has quickly  surpassed its target.
The game, which is known as Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City - The Board Game, comes from a collaboration with CMON, whose other works include Zombicide, Blood Rage, The Others, Rising Sun, Massive Darkness and Arcadia Quest, to name but a few. 
It sees up to four players taking on the role of the ruthless gangs vying for control in the &quot;glittering hellhole&quot; of Night City (much as the name suggests).

                              <span>Twitch is testing a new UI layout intended to boost discoverability, but the reaction so far is mixed.


At present, viewing the different game categories on Twitch brings up a grid view of various streams that need to be clicked on individually to view.


The new version being tested adds a video at the top which auto-plays as users click through the grid of streams beneath, before choosing to join the stream or follow the streamer.

                              <span>Sony has exceeded the number of games made available as part of its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogues by a decent margin.


Fans had been eyeing the service&#x27;s slow roll-out over the course of the past month through different countries around the world - until its final deployment in the UK and mainland Europe today. 


Ahead of time, Sony had promised &quot;up to 400&quot; PlayStation 4 and PS5 games would be available to both PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers - though the initial launch in Asia fell well short. Eurogamer&#x27;s list of PS4 and PS5 games available today comes to 429.

Now, Youtube channel 64 Bits has released a demake video of what Elden Ring would look like on a SNES. Spoiler: it looks fantastic.


Of course, it takes a top-down viewpoint akin to classic RPGs (the video notes Secret of Mana, Terranigma, and Final Fantasy 6 as inspiration), with a cute little Tarnished defeating various iconic bosses with melee weapons and magic.

The film is currently the eighth-biggest film launch worldwide this year, but, as Deadline reports, this place is likely to jump up a few notches with the film still to release in both Hong Kong and Japan. 
These numbers are a pretty impressive sight, but perhaps not unexpected. After all, Sonic 2 reportedly enjoyed the greatest opening weekend for any video-game based movie ever on its release in April.

The handheld shoot &#x27;em-up, originally launched in 2008, can be found by searching directly for the title in the PlayStation Store (thanks to reddit user Turb0_Thunder).


You won&#x27;t find it (yet) via the Classic Catalogue menu, although it&#x27;s unclear if this is because it&#x27;s not due to go live yet, or a deliberate secret. (Either way, PlayStation&#x27;s store interface isn&#x27;t the clearest to filter and search through.)

                              <span>PlayStation Plus Premium has finally completed its planned worldwide rollout, and arrived in the UK and mainland Europe today.


However, many of its Classic Catalogue PlayStation 1 games are available only in their PAL 50Hz versions - a slower standard superceded by the NTSC 60Hz option available elsewhere. 


This morning, Sony said it will provide &quot;NTSC options for a majority&quot; of these games in the future - though not detailed when or for which games.

Abstract: In recent decades, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which develops cryptographic standards for non-national security agencies of the U.S. government, has emerged as the de facto international source for cryptographic standards. But in 2013, Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency had subverted the integrity of a NIST cryptographic standard­the Dual_EC_DRBG­enabling easy decryption of supposedly secured communications. This discovery reinforced the desire of some public and private entities to develop their own cryptographic standards instead of relying on a U.S. government process. Yet, a decade later, no credible alternative to NIST has emerged. NIST remains the only viable candidate for effectively developing internationally trusted cryptography standards...</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good while since Square Enix&#x27;s troubled live-service action-adventure Marvel&#x27;s Avengers got itself a new playable hero - its most recent addition was the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man at the end of last year - but that drought will finally come to an end next Tuesday, 28th June, with the arrival of Jane Foster&#x27;s Mighty Thor.


When developer Crystal Dynamics first confirmed Foster was to be Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; next playable hero, the studio said the character would have &quot;a lot in common&quot; with the version of Thor already in-game, albeit with &quot;elements that are distinctly Jane&quot;.


Crystal Dynamics has since expanded on that, revealing Foster will arrive with a few new baseline abilities setting her apart from Odinson, including a new ranged combo and new ranged power attack. There&#x27;s also her new Intrinsic ability (All-Mother&#x27;s Blessing), a new Overcharge ability (God Tempest), and a new Ultimate ability (All-Weapon) enabling her to smite foes using both the Undrjarn and Mjölnir.

                              <span>Despite running into some considerable set-backs shortly after its initial announcement, leading to an indefinite delay, developer Nightdive Studios&#x27; highly anticipated remaster of Westwood Studio&#x27;s classic Blade Runner point-and-click adventure is finally complete, and will be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, tomorrow, 23rd June.


The Blade Runner game, for those unfamiliar, released in 1997, and, unlike the vast majority of licensed adaptations, was an extraordinary piece of work, not only managing to perfectly capture the neon-streaked dystopian atmosphere of the movie in a story that ran parallel to its action, but doing so in ways both wildly ambitious and legitimately groundbreaking.


Although Blade Runner takes its cue from narrative-driven point-and-click games, it immediately distinguishes itself from its genre peers by sending players, in the role of Blade Runner Ray McCoy, on a heavily randomised adventure. The goal remains the same each play-through, in that players must use their investigatory skills to identify and hunt down a number of replicants, but exactly which characters are replicants is determined at the start of a new game, subtly changing their behaviour as the story unfolds.

                              <span>Developer Creative Assembly has finally unmasked Hyenas, its long-in-the-works sci-fi shooter - and while Alien Isolation fans might be a little disappointed to see it&#x27;s not a much-hoped for successor, anyone who&#x27;s ever dreamed of doing heists in a space should be very cheerful.


Creative Assembly first revealed it was working on a sci-fi shooter back in September 2018, calling it an &quot;ambitious multiplayer title&quot; and a &quot;fresh take on the FPS genre&quot; that would enable players to &quot;embrace a variety of creative playstyles&quot;. Almost four years later, that project has now been named as Hyenas, a &quot;ballsy entry into the most competitive genre in gaming&quot;.


&quot;In Hyenas, the world is broken... literally,&quot; explains Creative Assembly. &quot;The billionaires have finally made it to Mars, leaving Earth and those tax bills far behind. The zero-gravity tech that powered their journey has shattered our planet, abandoning us in a drifting slum called the &#x27;Taint&#x27;. The only thing the rich care for is rare Merch, pop culture swag from the lives we left behind, which they loot from the rubble to furnish their Martian mansions.&quot;

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has said it has no current plans to remove the option of battling in raids from afar - a popular mechanic introduced in response to Covid lockdowns. 


Some fans had feared the concept would be cut - as other pandemic-era bonuses and gameplay have already been - especially as Niantic recently announced a new in-person only raid variety, which will debut this weekend for the game&#x27;s next Community Day.


&quot;That&#x27;s a unique experience that we&#x27;re setting up just for these extra bonuses in Community Day,&quot; Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka told me today, referring to the bonuses players will get to extend their local Community Day experience by taking part in the game&#x27;s new in-person-only event raids.

                              <span>An Elden Ring player has accidentally stumbled on an unknown - and invisible - boss thanks to a randomiser mod.


YouTuber MythyMoo used an item and boss randomiser mod that mixes up the placement of acquired items and bosses, which can massively impact the difficulty of a run. The mod also mixes up the names of each boss.


Except, as PCGamesN reports, things took a turn when MythyMoo arrived in the Consecrated Snowfield, an area with various field bosses.

Youtuber Vadim M found the code buried in the recently remastered  Vice City: Definitive Edition.


What&#x27;s interesting is that the code isn&#x27;t on the original retail copy of the game, hence why it was only just discovered.

                              <span>The Epic Games Store has launched its own version of user reviews and tags, via randomised game ratings and polls it hopes will avoid the kinds of review bombing seen frequently on Steam. 


The ability to rate a game on a five-star scale will be randomly offered to owners of that title who have played it for more than two hours. 


&quot;Because these requests are randomised, we won&#x27;t spam our players, and we probably won&#x27;t ask about every game or app used,&quot; Epic Games&#x27; Craig Pearson explained. &quot;This approach protects games from review bombing and ensures people assigning scores are actual players of the games.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo presented a deep dive into the imminent JRPG epic Xenoblade Chronicles in today&#x27;s focussed Direct presentation, revealing an expansion pass that unlocks helpful items and outfits upon the game&#x27;s release next month and that will provide access to a new story scenario that&#x27;s set to launch before the end of 2023. 


There was plenty more shown off, with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 thankfully dialling back some of the anime excesses of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - there was not a single improbably proportioned sidekick to be seen - while restoring some of the scale and wonder of Xenoblade Chronicles X. 


Set on the planet of Aionios, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set against a backdrop of warring factions from the nations of Keves and Agnos, and a world in which people have pre-determined lifespans of 10 years. Your party is drawn from three characters from each side who&#x27;ve put their differences aside - and opening up a broader, deeper take on combat that&#x27;s rich with systems.

                              <span>Anyone who plays Counter-Strike: Global Offensive knows that it&#x27;s a cosmetic collector first and first-person shooter second.


Some players take their cosmetic inventory very seriously, which they can buy and sell for hundreds of pounds.


Now one unfortunate collector claims their entire inventory - worth an estimated $2m - has been stolen by hackers (thanks, PCGamesN).

On Monday, Vips streamed Call of Duty: Warzone with fellow Red Bull junior driver Liam Lawson. As has been clipped, Vips cursed and said the n-word, to which Lawson replied &quot;Juri!&quot; and laughed.


Lawson also asked Vips to wear a pink Red Bull cap, to which he replied &quot;No, that&#x27;s gay&quot;. Lawson responded: &quot;Juri, you can&#x27;t say that&quot;.

The Beast Ball is a galactic-looking version of the regular Pokéball designed specifically for capturing Ultra Beasts, the extra-dimensional creatures which featured in Sun and Moon (and most recently arrived in Pokémon Go) via creepy wormholes.


Players at Pokémon Go&#x27;s three big in-person gatherings in Berlin, Seattle and Sapporo this summer will be first to use Beast Balls over the next six weeks, and get first access to one of the next three Ultra Beasts to arrive.

Better yet, you&#x27;re spoiled for choice, with Season four of Warzone giving you the option to play as the orginal T-800 or its succesor the T-1000 (Schwarzenegger voice lines not included).


Activision being Activision, the two Terminators are not bundled together, but rather as seperate time-limited packs.

Watkins Glen International is a staple of the US racing scene, playing host to F1 until it was deemed unsafe after a series of fatal accidents. It&#x27;s a ramshackle kind of place that now plays host to the likes of IMSA and NASCAR, and it&#x27;s an absolute delight to drive either of the configurations that are on offer in Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s take on the track. 


There&#x27;s a trio of new cars too, with a brace of Suzukis including a new fictional &#x27;Vision&#x27; car alongside the iconic V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special (now how about putting Pikes Peak in the game, seeing as Gran Turismo&#x27;s been squatting on the official licence for the legendary course for a while?).

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 will include party members in combat, despite the fact that recent trailers have focused solely on protagonist Clive.


Fans have speculated whether other characters will join battles, which producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed to IGN - although they will remain AI-controlled.


&quot;We didn&#x27;t want to overwhelm users in our newest trailer, so we focused solely on Clive&#x27;s battles. That said, for most of his journey, Clive will be accompanied by one or more companions. These companions will participate in battle, as well as trade banter with Clive. That said, the party members will be AI-driven so as to allow players to focus solely on controlling Clive,&quot; said Yoshida.

In a PlayStation Blog interview, the Final Fantasy 16 producer describes how he was honoured to be offered the opportunity to work on a single-player game in the series, but thought fans may criticise him.



&quot;I said &#x27;Thanks, but I have my hands full with Final Fantasy 14, so let me think about it.&#x27; I was truly honoured that the company would choose my section, Creative Business Unit 3, to be responsible for making the next entry in the FF series. But, as you probably know, I&#x27;m already the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14. I was worried that if I took on the directorship of 16, too, fans of both games would have good reason to believe I wasn&#x27;t giving either project my full attention,&quot; said Yoshida.

                              <span>Sony is set to announce a new line of hardware focused on gamers next week. 


A tweet from Sony asks you to &quot;Find Your Zone&quot; at 10pm UK time on 28th June. 


While there&#x27;s little official information on what&#x27;s going to be anounced, serial leaker Tom Henderson reported on what is expected (thanks, eXputer).

Doubling down on its commitment to the Battlefield franchise - and fixing the recent embattled Battlefield 2042 in particular - DICE has ruled out a return for any of its other franchises for now.


Speaking to Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, DICE&#x27;s recently-appointed general manager Rebecka Coutaz confirmed any project such as Mirror&#x27;s Edge was currently sat on the backburner.

                              <span>Forza Horizon 5 got a hefty new patch which adds two of the most requested features for Xbox and PC players alike. 


Players can now finally start Horizon Stories with friends in co-op, a feature that was strangely omitted from the game at launch and even stranger given the social nature of the game. 


Previously, players in a convoy would be booted off when the host starts a story mission.

                              <span>PlayStation is the latest big company to announce it will skip Gamescom this year. 


The annual European show, held in Cologne, was traditionally the world&#x27;s largest in terms of visitors. This summer will see Gamescom return as a physical event for the first time since 2019, albeit with fewer publishers in attendance. 

PlayStation confirmed its decision to skip Gamescom 2022 in a statement to German publication Games Wirtschaft (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), where it also confirmed it would not feature any announcements in the show&#x27;s Geoff Keighley-fronted livestream Opening Night Live.

Producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed the news in an interview with IGN, although he said that recent open world games have provided &quot;inspiration&quot;.


&quot;We&#x27;ve found in our extensive user research that many of the younger generation of gamers have never played a Final Fantasy or don&#x27;t have any interest in the series. To create a game that might excite and resonate not only with our core fans, but also with that new generation, we played a lot of games ourselves, and so yes, in [Final Fantasy 16] you&#x27;ll find inspiration from recent triple-A open world RPGs,&quot; said Yoshida.

                              <span>Yesterday, players were left unable to find matches in Fall Guys thanks to server issues sparked by the game&#x27;s multiplatform relaunch. 


Developer Mediatonic first acknowledged the issues yesterday afternoon, in a fashionably Fall Guys-style tweet.


Late last night, things seemed to be improving, with more players able to get into game. But still there were  &quot;teething issues&quot;, as servers were flooded with new players across PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

A &quot;peaceful protest&quot; to &quot;#SaveTF2&quot; was organised by fans in May to raise awareness of the game&#x27;s many bugs, its ongoing bot problems, and the general lack of updates by Valve despite TF2&#x27;s ongoing popularity.


In response, Valve said it had heard the game&#x27;s community. &quot;We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things,&quot; it wrote shortly after.

Producer Naoki Yoshida has spoken in multiple interviews about the game, divulging new information about its conception.


&quot;When it came to deciding what to do with Final Fantasy 16, I thought back to when I played the original Final Fantasy, and remembered how I felt like I was playing the leading role in a motion picture,&quot; he said in a new PlayStation Blog post.

What makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware that we usually come across, is that it needs to infect other running processes to inflict damage on infected machines. Instead of being a standalone executable file that is run to infect a machine, it is a shared object (SO) library that is loaded into all running processes using LD_PRELOAD (T1574.006), and parasitically infects the machine. Once it has infected all the running processes, it provides the threat actor with rootkit functionality, the ability to harvest credentials, and remote access capability...</span>

                              <span>Following its conspicuously release-window-free unveiling back in April, Blizzard has now confirmed World of Warcraft&#x27;s Dragonflight expansion will launch later this year.


Dragonflight, as detailed in Blizzard&#x27;s April reveal stream, will give players access to the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind, known as the Dragon Isles, introducing four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, Ohn’ahran Plains, Azure Span, and Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also adds the Dracthyr Evokers - a new playable race-class hybrid that can, depending on a players&#x27; chosen class specialisations, focus on either damage dealing or healing - plus a new skill-based flight system tied to customisable dragon companions.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve a proposal that the company should publish an annual report detailing the effectiveness and outcomes of its efforts to prevent abuse, harassment, and discrimination in its workplace - a non-binding vote Activision has, as yet, only said it will &quot;carefully consider&quot;.


The proposal, originally raised by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in February, requested that Activision publically release an annual report detailing several key metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company&#x27;s progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.


While this kind of transparency might seem prudent given the shocking allegations that have surfaced in relation to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s workplace practices over the last year, and given that the publisher remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last July&#x27;s State of California filing, which called the company a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - the company&#x27;s board of directors instead wrote to shareholders in May unanimously urging them to vote against the proposal.

                              <span>After more than five years of development, Redbeet Interactive&#x27;s enormously enjoyable open water survival adventure Raft has just received its full version 1.0 release, bringing, among other things, the final chunk of its exploratory story campaign.


Raft, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, first started to attract attention as a free prototype on itch.io back in 2016. Redbeet steadily expanded on that version&#x27;s core survival loop - in which players start out on a tiny wooden raft in the middle of the ocean, hooking up foods, supplies, and building materials until their tiny vessel is a veritable sea-faring palace - in preparation for a commercial early access release on Steam, which finally arrived in 2018.


Since then, Redbeet has continued to build on that early feature set, introducing the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign in which players can learn more about the flooded world.

                              <span>Planet Zoo&#x27;s steady stream of post-launch DLC continues today with the arrival of its 11th paid expansion, the eco-themed Conservation Pack, on Steam, introducing a selection of new, endangered animals, new scenery items, and more.


On the animal front, Planet Zoo&#x27;s Conservation Pack brings five new additions - Przewalski&#x27;s horse, amur leopard, scimitar-horned oryx, siamang, and axolotl - all of which are considered at-risk species as a result of climate change, poaching, and habitat degradation.


Elsewhere, the DLC introduces a new scenario challenging players to assist the Turtlerock Wildlife Orphanage, inspired by Mongolia&#x27;s Gorkhi Terelj National Park, by rescuing, raising, documenting and releasing as many species as possible. Renewable energy, plant diversity, and sustainability will be an important focus too.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eyeing up Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands but have been disinclined to purchase it during its Epic Games Store exclusivity period, you might like to know it&#x27;s making the leap to Steam this Thursday, 23rd June.


Released on Epic, PlayStation, and Xbox in March, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands takes the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2&#x27;s much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep and spins it out into a full-sized game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


The game-within-a-game premise casts players as an unnamed &quot;newbie&quot; in the real, Borderlands world who&#x27;s taking part in a D&amp;D-like game called Bunkers and Badasses. Several celebrity-voiced friends are along for the ride, as is the irrepressible Tina, as Dungeon Master.

                              <span>Microsoft has confirmed a shortage of Xbox controllers in the UK as major retailers have sold out of stock.


As VGC reports, the official Microsoft Store currently has no controllers available in any colour, while retailers GAME, Smyths, Argos and Currys also have no stock.

Amazon UK does have the Carbon Black controller in stock at the time of writing, but third-party prices for a new (not used) controller start at £93.99 (official price is £54.99).

Then, 23rd June brings two more titles: FIFA 2022 (console and PC) and mythical action game Naraka: Bladepoint (cloud, console, PC).

                              <span>The rights to Steam hit Spintires - as well as the fate of millions of dollars in revenue for spin-off sequels Mudrunner and Snowrunner - are the focus of several major legal claims between Saber Interactive and the game&#x27;s original publisher Oovee, Eurogamer can reveal. 


The increasingly bitter fight between the two companies escalated significantly last week with the issuing of a press release by a legal firm associated with Oovee containing numerous claims directed at Saber, and the brief return of Spintires to Steam despite its previous delisting in the wake of another legal challenge. 


Saber has subsequently filed a defamation claim in relation to Oovee&#x27;s allegations, Eurogamer can also reveal, while Spintires&#x27; Steam page is now back offline pending various DMCA challenges.

A tweet from the Nintendo Japan account states that the iOS version of the app will be updated in &quot;summer 2022&quot; and will only be compatible with iOS version 14.0 or later.


It therefore won&#x27;t be available on iOS version 13.0 or earlier, according to a rough translation of the tweet.

                              <span>EA&#x27;s Battlefield 2042 has attracted its fair share of controversy since it launched last November, with players unhappy with the omission of key features at launch as well as some questionable design decisions which resulted in fan backlash. 


There have been updates since release that have corrected the course of Battlefield 2042, with the belated launch of its first season earlier this month introducing a new map and features that have gone down well with the game&#x27;s community. 


Despite these updates, however, Battlefield 2042 still has players fighting under a Russian flag as one of the two factions in the game - a decision that sits uncomfortably given the invasion of Ukraine from Russian forces, and in light of EA&#x27;s decision to remove Russian clubs and the Russian national football team from FIFA 22, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online.

On the tiniest LCD screen I&#x27;ve ever seen, here&#x27;s Doom running inside a single Lego brick.


Brilliantly, this brick is a Lego element typically used as a computer screen, with the insides hollowed out to insert a miniature circuit and LCD display.

                              <span>Criticism of Chris Pratt&#x27;s casting as Mario in Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie will likely &quot;evaporate&quot; once people hear his performance for themselves, it&#x27;s been claimed. 


The choice of Hollywood hunk Pratt - star of Marvel, Jurassic World - as Mario raised eyebrows among many fans when it was first announced.

                              <span>Sony is reportedly discontinuing PS Plus retail cards from stores ahead of the launch of its revamped subscription service.


The cards have been available to top up PS Plus membership for one, three, or 12 months, but as spotted by Polish site XGP they&#x27;re no longer available.



The move coincides with the launch of Sony&#x27;s new subscription service this week, which has multiple price tiers - making the old retail cards somewhat obsolete.

                              <span>Many were left disappointed when a new Silent Hill game was not announced during the not-E3-but-sort-of showcases over the last few weeks. However, for those that are keen for more thrills (and bloody spills) in its horror-filled world, fear not, as fans have your backs. 
A remake of the original Silent Hill is currently being made in Unreal Engine 5 by a group called Codeless Games (via DSO Gaming). And not only is it in development, but we have also been given a peak at 10 minutes of gameplay that focuses on Midwich Elementary School (a major building that protagonist Harry Mason explores in a bid to find his missing daughter). 
This project does a pretty good job at setting the scene and overall atmosphere.

However, these plans were scuppered when Activision merged developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard - a move which saw the studio re-named to Blizzard Albany and re-emerge as a support studio for the Diablo franchise and other Blizzard titles.


Hawk spoke of the now-scrapped plans in detail for the first time last night, while a guest on a fan Twitch livestream.

However, a game crash occurs after the Basilisk Crash cutscene when landing on Onderon, which Aspyr is working to fix.

Reducing the power to tech monopolies would do more to “fix” the Internet than any other single action, and I am generally in favor of them both. (The Center for American Progress wrote a good summary and evaluation of them. I have written in support of the bill that would force Google and Apple to give up their monopolies on their phone app stores.)...</span>

                              <span>PlayStation 5 may be a lot of things to a lot of different people, but one thing most would probably agree on is that it&#x27;s a bloody big console. Now, however, one enterprising YouTuber has taken up the challenge of downsizing the machine to create the &quot;world&#x27;s first PS5 Slim console&quot; - one that&#x27;s less than 2cm thick.


The project is the work of YouTube channel DIY Perks, which specialises in videos about designing and building gadgets and technology at home, and begins with a tear-down of Sony&#x27;s behemoth console to figure exactly which of its innards should stay and wish can go to hit that 2cm target.


Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the PS5&#x27;s bulk comes from its steel shrouding and CPU-cooling heatsink, and with those gone, DIY Perk&#x27;s target seems a little closer to reality. Ultimately, to hit that magic number, PS5&#x27;s existing cooling solution is replaced with a custom water-channeling system made from copper sheeting. It&#x27;s not a cheap option, costing an eyewatering $240 for the sheeting alone, but it appears to do the job.

                              <span>As the launch of its first major expansion approaches, Outriders - developer People Can Fly&#x27;s enjoyable third-person sci-fi shooter - is free to try on Steam this week, giving new players an opportunity to see what they&#x27;re missing.


Outriders launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation last April, delivering a slice of co-operative shooter action that Eurogamer reviewer Vikki Blake enjoyed, albeit with some caveats. &quot;For some,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I suspect Outriders doesn&#x27;t innovate enough to stand out from an already oversaturated shooter market, relying too much on the ideas of other, stronger titles that have come before it.&quot;


&quot;[But] as a die-hard Guardian and card-carrying fangirl of the genre,&quot; Vikki continued, &quot;Outriders tickles me in all the right places. Offering gunplay that feels solid and satisfying and an array of additional powers and abilities to keep combat fresh and exciting, I can only admit that Outriders has surprised me in all the right ways. Maybe it&#x27;ll surprise you, too.&quot;

                              <span>Northgard developer Shiro Games&#x27;  sci-fi strategy game Dune: Spice Wars now includes multiplayer support following the launch of its its first major early access update.


Dune: Spice Wars was well-received when it launched into Steam early access back in April, but several key features were missing from that initial release, including all-important multiplayer support. Shiro eventually confirmed multiplayer would arrive this &quot;summer&quot; as part of its inaugural development roadmap, and that day is finally here.


According to today&#x27;s patch notes, Dune&#x27;s multiplayer can utilise both dedicated servers and peer-to-peer connections, and enables players to try their hand at 2v2 matches or test their mettle in four-person free-for-alls, playing as Atreides, Harkonnen, Fremen, or Smugglers.

                              <span>Following its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC debut last month, Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play 3v3 skater Roller Champions has been given a Switch release date, and will, according to a new UK eShop listing, arrive on Nintendo&#x27;s platform tomorrow, 21st June.


Roller Champions is Ubisoft&#x27;s stab at creating its own chaotic sports mash-up in the vein of Rocket League, albeit one that switches out the latter&#x27;s cars-meet-football concept for a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football.


The gist is that two teams of three players hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another. When one team finally has the ball, they need to complete at least one lap before pelting it into the goal, with additional points accrued the more laps they can keep hold of it before taking a successful shot.

                              <span>Sifu already lets you live out your kung-fu fantasy as a 3D beat-em-up. But what if motion controls could really bring that alive?


Streamer Rudeism, known for his weird and wonderful controllers and challenge run streams, has created a motion controller for Sifu as his latest project and streamed the results over the weekend.




How does it work? He wears two gloves that have motion sensors and a stick in each hand for movement. Simply punching the air is enough for light attacks, with other motions used for heavy attacks and parries, and then picking up items and other interactions are done by clicking in the sticks.

The news follows the recent Dragon&#x27;s Dogma livestream, in which Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 development was confirmed.



Since then, the game has hit a new peak of 6582 concurrent players according to SteamDB. That&#x27;s the highest number of concurrent players since hitting 27,368 when it was released six years ago.

Deducing cryptographic keys by analyzing power consumption has long been an attack, but it’s not generally viable because measuring power consumption is often hard. This new attack measures power consumption by measuring time, making it easier to exploit.
The team discovered that dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)—a power and thermal management feature added to every modern CPU—allows attackers to deduce the changes in power consumption by monitoring the time it takes for a server to respond to specific carefully made queries. The discovery greatly reduces what’s required. With an understanding of how the DVFS feature works, power side-channel attacks become much simpler timing attacks that can be done remotely...</span>

                              <span>Alice: Madness Returns has once again disappeared from Steam.

Alice&#x27;s disappearance will be particularly frustrating for some, as the 2011 game only returned to Steam in February 2022 after a DRM issue saw it removed from sale for almost five years. Now, just a few months later, it&#x27;s gone again.

The reason for its sudden and unexpected disappearance? It&#x27;s not entirely clear. Steam&#x27;s not giving away much; Alice: Madness Returns&#x27; Steam page simply says &quot;at the request of the publisher, Alice: Madness Returns is no longer available for sale on Steam&quot;, which is a blanket statement that covers pretty much anything and everything.

                              <span>Tactical FPS Ready or Not is back on sale on Steam today after resolving a trademark dispute.

Yesterday, developer Void Interactive tweeted that it was dealing with a &quot;suggested trademark infringement&quot; of its &quot;recent Night Club map&quot; which rolled out as part of the early access game&#x27;s most recent update earlier in the week.

&quot;We take IP concerns very seriously, and in a show of good faith, we have decided to remove the subject materials and any reference to them from Ready or Not and from any of our social media or other publications,&quot; Void said (thanks, NME).

                              <span>Nintendo has joined up with Lego once again to create eight new Super Mario-themed character packs.

As recapped on the Lego blog as Lego Con 2022 came to a close, &quot;two Lego Super Mario designers, Alice and Didier, raced against a 90-second clock to find the eight brand-new Lego Super Mario characters from the Series 5 Character Packs.

After searching through piles of Lego bricks, the pair eventually revealed a Red Yoshi, Purple Toad, Blue Shy Guy, Waddlewing and more. We also spotted Nabbit, Hammer Bro, Toady, and Baby Yoshi, too.

The documentary - which was released on 13th December across &quot;a variety of video platforms&quot;, including Roku, IMDb TV, YouTube, Redbox, and more - won the award for Outstanding Single-Camera Editing (thanks, VGC).

The project - which explores the history of Microsoft&#x27;s console, from its conception to recent successes - began three years ago and was announced at the Xbox Anniversary Celebration.

Published by Bandai Namco, the fighter will arrive on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S where the Smash Bros-like brawl will let &quot;Minifigure mayhem begin&quot;. Here&#x27;s a new teaser to celebrate:

As Tom explained at the time the ports were announced, the idea here is to battle - solo or with up to eight network players - and collect minifigures which you can then customise to create your own hero of choice. You can then take said hero and attempt to tackle the game&#x27;s global leaderboards.

As spotted by PCGN, a number of new items introduced along with the Werewolf expansion have descriptions that players of Square Enix&#x27;s hugely-popular MMORPG may find familiar. 

There&#x27;s the Racked Teak-a Greatshelves - a fantastic, if not particularly subtle, nod to Shadowbringers&#x27; Rak&#x27;tika Greatwood where the Viera live - as well as a reference to the game&#x27;s theme track.

                              <span>Despite its controversial launch, Diablo Immortal - Blizzard&#x27;s pocket-sized Diablo experience - has generated almost £20 million ($24m) since it launched earlier this month.

According to the analysts at Appmagic (thanks, Pocket Gamer), that makes Diablo Immortal - which has been downloaded over eight million times in just a fortnight - one of Blizzard&#x27;s biggest mobile app, second only to the immense popularity of Hearthstone. 

The game has seen its biggest success in the US, which accounts for 26 per cent of all downloads. This is followed by South Korea, Brazil, and Japan, with 11 per cent, 8 per cent, and 8 per cent of the market share respectively. The UK only features in the 17 per cent &quot;other&quot; category which aggregates low-level figures across the rest of the world.

                              <span>We’ve always known that phones—and the people carrying them—can be uniquely identified from their Bluetooth signatures, and that we need security techniques to prevent that. This new research shows that that’s not enough.
Computer scientists at the University of California San Diego proved in a study published May 24 that minute imperfections in phones caused during manufacturing create a unique Bluetooth beacon, one that establishes a digital signature or fingerprint distinct from any other device. Though phones’ Bluetooth uses cryptographic technology that limits trackability, using a radio receiver, these distortions in the Bluetooth signal can be discerned to track individual devices...</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, developer Supermassive released its sumputous slasher horror The Quarry on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in collaboration with publisher 2K Games - but a new report has claimed the game was originally in development as a &quot;signature&quot; title for Stadia, before Google made the decision to downsize its gaming operation and send the project elsewhere.


Stadia, of course, launched to much fanfare in 2019, and part of Google&#x27;s promise to early adopters was that the service would bring its own console-like exclusives from both first- and third-parties. To that end, Google established its own internal game development studio and signed deals with external developers, including Supermassive, as announced in 2020.


Those plans, however, changed dramatically just 14 months after Stadia&#x27;s high-profile arrival, with Google announcing a major rethink of its cloud streaming strategy following a less-than-stellar launch, which included the cancellation of all internal game development as it began prioritising selling its tech to third-parties.

                              <span>As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty&#x27;s server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, known as Ricochet, has unveiled a new mitigation technique that takes a player&#x27;s weapons (and fists) away when the system identifies them as a cheater.


Word of this latest mitigation technique comes via a new blog update detailing the current state of Call of Duty&#x27;s anti-cheat solution, and follows previously revealed anti-cheat techniques Cloaking and Damage Shield.


Damage Shield, Richochet&#x27;s first major mitigation technique, essentially works by turning on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater is detected in-match. Cloaking, meanwhile, makes it impossible for detected cheaters to see opponents and bullets, or even hear sounds.

Yet at the other end of the spectrum, indie games currently have an obsession with frogs and witches. 


But why? What is it about frogs and witches?

Announced at the Final Fantasy 7 25th anniversary celebration, the game is no longer exclusive to Epic on PC and even runs on the Steam Deck.


At full price it&#x27;s £70 - the same as on Epic (quietly increased since launch) and in line with other Square Enix new releases - however you can save 29 percent as a special launch promotion.

It&#x27;s a project that began back in April when Anna Ellsworth posted a YouTube video explaining the process of turning her harp into a controller.


Since then, she&#x27;s beaten the dreaded Dark Souls pair Ornstein and Smough and has now turned to Elden Ring, most recently defeating Margit the Fell Omen.

While 11 Bit is publishing and assisting with Project Vitriol, the game is actually the work of Polish developer Fool&#x27;s Theory - a &quot;collective of AAA veterans&quot; with previous credits on The Witcher 2 and 3. Its previous title, open-world RPG Seven: The Days Long Gone, released in 2017, and the studio has also lent support to the likes of Outriders and Divinity Original Sin 2.


As for Project Vitriol, 11 Bit Studios says the &quot;deep, morally ambiguous narrative-driven RPG&quot; is &quot;of a scale and scope not previously undertaken by the publisher&quot;, and Fool&#x27;s Theory CEO and project lead Jakub Rokosz had a little more to say as part of its announcement.

The roughly $20m pay cut was signalled last summer, when EA acknowledged &quot;stockholder feedback&quot; from a non-binding but decisive say-on-pay vote. 


In a nutshell, stockholders said EA&#x27;s execs were being handed pay awards from the company money pot that were too large and too frequent. In response, EA said it would make &quot;substantial changes&quot; to the pay of executives.

The upcoming project, for now named &quot;TemPoPo&quot;, is still under-wraps. But &quot;a pixel art rendition of the key art... existings somewhere inside Unpacking&quot;, Witchbeam has said. 


The developer dropped the hint in a new blog update, and noted that no one had found the Easter egg so far. Still, the expectation is that now this information is out there, it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to discover. &quot;Let us know if you find it!&quot; Witchbeam concluded.

                              <span>A new fan made crossover sees The Last of Us&#x27; Joel and Ellie take on the snow-covered wilds of God of War. 
This crossover is thanks to the hard work of Speclizer, who used mods from OmegaFantasy to swap out Kratos and Atreus for Joel and Ellie respectively (it was also OmegaFantasy that enabled The Simpsons to tootle on over to God of War last month). This was done to &quot;celebrate two amazing games coming out this year&quot;.
And its not just Joel and Ellie that we get to see in action. The Last of Us&#x27; David also shows up as the mysterious &#x27;stranger&#x27; from the start of God of War, while the draugr have now become clickers.

                              <span>N64 classic Pokémon Snap will be added to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack library next week, on Friday 24th June. 


This is the game where you capture pictures of Pokémon, rather than capture the creatures themselves and force them to do your bidding. 


There have been plenty of weird and wonderful Pokémon spin-offs over the years, but Snap holds a firm place as one of the best. Via an on-rails safari through Pokémon environments, you get to see the little critters mucking about in their natural habitats.

Speaking to VGC, senior narrative designer Eevi Korhonen discussed the future of the studio and whether the story of Selene was finished.


&quot;Returnal was so ambitious,&quot; Korhonen said. &quot;We dreamt super big, but we still had to leave so much on the cutting room floor. All of these ideas and narrative systems. I&#x27;m super excited to pick up those pieces and see how those fit our new IP story.&quot;

The game&#x27;s early access version - a mix of base-building and crafting with multiplayer elements - has proven very popular, and positive reviews helped it hit 1m copies sold in just over a week. 


&quot;We at Stunlock are very proud of the amazing start V Rising has made since launching on Early Access,&quot;  Rickard Frisegård, boss of Swedish developer Stunklock said.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait but Capcom has finally announced it&#x27;s working on a sequel to cult-classic fantasy RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma.


Speculation has been rife regarding a follow-up to the well-regarded 2012 game for some time, only exacerbated by Capcom&#x27;s decision to host a tenth anniversary livestream for the not exactly blockbuster title.


It was in this retrospective livestream that Capcom&#x27;s long-awaited announcement was finally made, with series director Hideaki Itsuno revealing that Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is currently in development by whipping off his jacket to reveal a t-shirt emblazoned with the sequel&#x27;s logo.

The feature, which should be particularly useful to Game Pass subscribers reckoning with the service&#x27;s sizeable library of titles, is being referred to as the Game Performance Fit Indicator.


Essentially, each time you look at a game via the Xbox App, you&#x27;ll see a short message offering a prediction of how well Microsoft expects it to run on your machine, generated by comparing a title&#x27;s performance on PCs with similar specs to yours.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced this year&#x27;s ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest event, which promises to deliver over 30 playable pre-release Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S demos starting next week.


Things kick off next Tuesday, 21st June and the event&#x27;s demos will remain available to play for seven days, with proceedings coming to a close the following Monday, 27th June.


&quot;These &#x27;game demos&#x27; are not the norm,&quot; Microsoft notes in its announcement post. &quot;Typically, the demos you see in our Demo channel are created after the game is completed (or nearly completed) and represents an almost final to final version. Think of these as akin to &#x27;show floor demos&#x27; and not necessarily indicative of the final product.&quot;

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has confirmed Overwatch 2, which will be an &quot;always on, always evolving&quot; free-to-play game when it launches into early access on 4th October, will be ditching its predecessor&#x27;s lootboxes in favour of a seasonal battle pass and in-game store.


That news was shared during an extended Overwatch 2 livestream this evening, primarily focused on the game&#x27;s live-service model and seasonal content plan - the latter of which, according to Overwatch 2&#x27;s game director Aaron Keller, will enable Blizzard to deliver new content to players on a more &quot;frequent and consistent&quot; basis compared to the original game.


Each season will last nine weeks and alternately add a new hero then a new map. That&#x27;s a little different for season 1, however, with Blizzard promising three new heroes, six new maps, the new Push game mode, weekly challenges, 30+ new skins, and a new mythic skin when things get underway on 4th October in tandem with Overwatch 2&#x27;s early access launch.

                              <span>A new report by Activision Blizzard has claimed there is &quot;no widespread harassment, or systemic harassment&quot; at the company.


In response to multiple lawsuits against the company, Activision Blizzard conducted its own investigation and has published the findings.


&quot;Contrary to many of the allegations, the Board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that Activision Blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported,&quot; reads the report.

                              <span>Those clever people at Star Wars know how to get their fan community talking. In this case, we have a little nod to Star Wars: The Force Unleashed tucked away in the latest episode of Disney+&#x27;s Obi Wan Kenobi.
There will be spoilers for Obi-Wan Kenobi below. Read at your own discretion.
So, I will get straight to it. In short, the latest showing of Obi-Wan Kenobi sees everyone&#x27;s favourite Sith Lord pulling a stunt first made famous by The Force Unleashed&#x27;s Starkiller.

Mass Effect Legendary Edition contains the entire Mass Effect trilogy fully remastered with visual enhancements, technical improvements, and gameplay adjustments.


&quot;The upgrades are vast and far-reaching in the remaster. Shadow quality is boosted, geometry tweaked, and we have improved anti-aliasing to support the 4K picture on Series X, S and PS5,&quot; wrote Thomas Morgan in Digital Foundry&#x27;s analysis of the collection.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we&#x27;re ready to round off this two-week not-E3 announcement bonanza with a chat about Starfield, and a look to the future.

Starfield dominated Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s E3 event and was arguably the biggest game on show over the fortnight, though praise was hardly unanimous. It looked like a Bethesda RPG, many said, somehow not expecting exactly just that. Between the news you can&#x27;t fly to space and won&#x27;t have a voice, was it really as disappointing as some have made out?


Finally, with this main glut of not-E3 conferences done and dusted, talk turns to next year - when 2023 will see the return of both E3 and Summer Game Fest as in-person events. What will that look like, and will things be less messy in twelve months? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

                              <span>The Switch is certainly doing the numbers for Nintendo. In fact, it has now surpassed the sales figures of the 3DS in Japan, and as a result has become the third best selling console of all time in the country. 
These new stats come from industry insider Daniel Ahmad, who noted that Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console was now &quot;on track to reach the highs of the Game Boy (32.4m) and DS (32.9m)&quot;.
News of the Switch selling 25m units in Japan comes from Famitsu.

                              <span>Call of Duty Warzone is getting a brand-new map as part of Vanguard/Warzone&#x27;s Season Four update.

The map, titled &quot;Fortune’s Keep&quot;, features several key locations including Keep, a towering structure which houses 20 cannons, 10 staircases, 12 rooms and a fountain, and Smuggler&#x27;s Cove, another area with a focus on verticality, which includes eight ladders, three ziplines, eight huts and 11 boats.

Given the approximate size of Fortune&#x27;s Keep, one could speculate that this new map could replace Rebirth Island, the secondary map first introduced to Warzone with the release of Black Ops: Cold War.

The content in question was found by Koopavocelot (via kart_tour), and reveals new battle courses with sound files for GCN Cookie Land, DS Twilight House, Tour Paris Promenade, New York Minute and GBA Battle Course 1.
This, of course, may not mean a Battle Mode is coming to Mario Kart Tour, but its an interesting thought.

                              <span>Another day, another case of Nintendo being Nintendo. This time, the company is cracking down on a YouTuber that uploaded covers of music from Metroid Prime to their channel.
Content creator SynaMax revealed that nine of his videos have had to be taken down, after Nintendo sent in the big guns and flexed their legal muscles his way.
&quot;On 31st May, a lawyer representing Nintendo called me and asked me to take down nine videos off the channel,&quot; SynaMax explained in a new video (spotted by VGC). &quot;I&#x27;m really disappointed in Nintendo that they would force me to take down these videos because they want compulsory licenses.&quot;

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto has explained what the game&#x27;s &quot;Open Zone&quot; structure really means.


Speaking to IGN, Kishimoto&#x27;s comments somewhat clarify what separates Sonic Frontiers from open-world games.


&quot;Level-based platformers often have a world map. Our Open Zone is a world map, only we&#x27;ve made it entirely playable,&quot; said Kishimoto.

Speaking to IGN, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith revealed, &quot;whoever hosts the session, or whoever initiates the session... their progress is persistent for them. But [for] other people, it&#x27;s not. In terms of what missions you&#x27;ve unlocked and such, the host, their progression matters.&quot;
He went on to explain, &quot;if you sign on with a friend and they&#x27;re halfway through the game, and you play the second half of the game with them and then you need to go back and you want to play on your own, you&#x27;ll be starting at the beginning of the campaign with a character&quot;.

                              <span>Capcom has reactivated the previous versions of Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 on PC, following player feedback.


After the Capcom showcase, the publisher released a free upgrade across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, adding in ray-tracing, 4K support, and 3D audio.


However, on PC the new version had increased minimum system requirements and was unable to revert back to the previous version, locking some players out of the game. This has now been reactivated.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Sponge Examples: Energy-Latency Attacks on Neural Networks“:
Abstract: The high energy costs of neural network training and inference led to the use of acceleration hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. While such devices enable us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, their designers’ focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully-crafted sponge examples, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency, to drive machine learning (ML) systems towards their worst-case performance. Sponge examples are, to our knowledge, the first denial-of-service attack against the ML components of such systems. We mount two variants of our sponge attack on a wide range of state-of-the-art neural network models, and find that language models are surprisingly vulnerable. Sponge examples frequently increase both latency and energy consumption of these models by a factor of 30×. Extensive experiments show that our new attack is effective across different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and an ASIC simulator) on a wide range of different language tasks. On vision tasks, we show that sponge examples can be produced and a latency degradation observed, but the effect is less pronounced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge examples in the real world, we mount an attack against Microsoft Azure’s translator and show an increase of response time from 1ms to 6s (6000×). We conclude by proposing a defense strategy: shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective...</span>

                              <span>EA has announced FIFA 22 will be joining its EA Play subscription service, as well as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, next Thursday, 23rd June.


FIFA 22, if you haven&#x27;t been keeping track, brought some solid improvements to the long-running football series when it launched last year, but its wins were, once again, overshadowed by what Eurogamer&#x27;s Wesley Yin-Poole called its &quot;morally bankrupt monetisation&quot; in his review.


&quot;I play a lot of FIFA, and with good reason,&quot; Wes wrote. &quot;I enjoy it, in a grumpy sort of way. Reporting on all the good, bad and ugly FIFA has to offer has been a fascinating part of my job over the last decade. If you&#x27;re only in it for Career Mode, for example, FIFA 22 is a good shout. If you only play Volta (there must be someone!) then there&#x27;s nothing particularly offensive about the game. But context is king. Ultimate Team cannot be ignored.&quot;

                              <span>A new report has claimed Sony is working on a &quot;pro&quot; controller for PlayStation 5 that it&#x27;s planning to officially unveil &quot;soon&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to the ever leaky Tom Henderson who, writing for Try Hard Guides (thanks VGC), claims to have seen images of a prototype from a source wishing to remain anonymous.


Henderson says the new controller retains the same basic style of the existing PlayStation 5 controller but features a number of key differences. These include &quot;removable stick units&quot; - which can be switched in and out using buttons below the analog sticks - plus trigger stops, a seemingly removal grip, and rear buttons that Henderson describes as &quot;flappy paddles&quot;, presumably similar to those seen on the likes of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.

                              <span>Following its long-awaited official unveiling last week, Naughty Dog has given another glimpse of its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for PS5 and PC, this time showcasing what it calls a &quot;glow up&quot; for supporting character Tess.


During last week&#x27;s Summer Game Fest reveal, one of key arguments Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann made for remaking the original Last of Us - a game that already got the remaster treatment in 2014 - was that the additional power of modern hardware would enable it to get closer to its &quot;original vision&quot;. The studio specifically highlighted the remake&#x27;s rebuilt character models and faces, which it said would better reflect the cast&#x27;s original performances.


Inevitably, the remake&#x27;s character changes have come as something of a shock to fans who&#x27;ve grown attached to the original versions over the last nine years, with both Joel and Ellie now sporting more realistic facial makeovers that age them notably. That&#x27;s especially true for Naughty Dog&#x27;s latest reveal, showcasing the new version of Joel&#x27;s friend Tess, who initially agrees to help smuggle Ellie out of the city.

                              <span>Wo Long development producer Masaaki Yamagiwa has commented on the difficulty level of Team Ninja&#x27;s new Soulslike, revealed at the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase.


Yamagiwa previously worked at Sony&#x27;s Japan Studio when it published Bloodborne, so understands the importance of balanced difficulty.


&quot;Difficult games shouldn&#x27;t be difficult just for the sake of it,&quot; Yamagiwa told IGN. &quot;I think it&#x27;s really important that this difficulty exists for the purpose of delivering a sense of accomplishment to the players once they have overcome it. That&#x27;s why I think players should always be able to blame themselves when they die. The game has to be fair and its difficulty should never be unreasonable. In that regard, it works in my favour that I&#x27;m not very good at games myself. I&#x27;ll always naturally be judging the fairness of games.&quot;

Included in this reel are clips of Jen Taylor mocapping her character of Cortana, as well as the evolution of the series&#x27; many digital environments. Taylor has famously voiced the role of Cortana throughout the Halo games, making her inclusion in the show a pretty special one for fans.
It is an interesting watch and, for those in the UK, one of our best looks at the show yet. You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>We all know Elden Ring is a tricky game and its optional boss battle against Malenia is arguably the most difficult moment of the game.


But one streamer, Kwitty23, decided to beat the whole game playing as Malenia. Not only that, he only used one move the entire run: her iconic Waterfowl Dance.


Funniest of all was when Kwitty23 ended up fighting Malenia as Malenia and proceeded to destroy her first time. Turns out she&#x27;s pretty weak to her own attacks.

Senior concept artist Gervasio Canda has shared dozens of artworks over the past few years, which have garnered attention this week after fans began discussing one piece of art in particular. 


The following artwork is the only one in Canda&#x27;s collection to depict a landscape that has not (to date) appeared in Fortnite. Are we looking into the future of the game? Or, perhaps more likely, is this an area Epic Games ended up not using?

This adaptation, which is set to release on 11th August 2023, will focus on the story of one teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills won them a series of Nissan competitions to become a professional race car driver. Deadline reports the screenplay has been written by Jason Hall.
If this all sounds familiar to you and you are getting a strong sense of déjà vu, well, you&#x27;re right to feel that way. After all, this is the same concept from the Gran Turismo film that never was.

At the time of this announcement, Capcom revealed those yet to experience the games will be able to purchase the newly updated Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions from their respective stores, but existing owners on Xbox One and PS4 would be able to grab the updates relevant to their platform at no additional cost.
However, it now transpires this is not the case for those who got their hands on Resident Evil 7 through the PlayStation Plus Collection (something that is exclusive to the PS5).
Instead, those who have been playing the game via the PS Plus Collection but also want to experience the game with its 4K resolution, &quot;high&quot; framerates, ray tracing, and 3D audio will need to purchase the game separately (via IGN).

                              <span>A new The Convergence mod is on the way for Elden Ring.


The Convergence Team - a group of three modders - created a celebrated mod for Dark Souls 3 that significantly altered the main game. It added new character classes, over 100 new spells, new rings, armours and weapons, new factions, and even new NPCs and bosses.


It looks like Elden Ring will be getting the same treatment.

That&#x27;s according to Yoshimi Yasuda, the game&#x27;s executive producer, who recently formed a fresh company to work on projects unknown. 


Does this mean a re-release, a remaster or a sequel to the original Lollipop Chainsaw, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this week? Yasuda declined to mention.

The remixes are of original tracks by Camellia and Toki.


&quot;We promised you an anniversary gift, and here it is!&quot; said the developers in a tweet. Judging by the accompanying video, the difficulty has certainly ramped up.

Details shared by the Kid Kirby Archive Twitter include manual pages, a story overview and new renders, all of which were provided by writer Steve Hammond.
First off, we have a render of King Dedede, a character only previously seen in much lower quality on a 1995 internal brochure.

The video, below, is a tough and often extraordinary watch - but one which details how life has changed for the game&#x27;s team over the course of this year.


Many GSC staff have now fled Ukraine, though others have been unable to. Here, those still in the country show their current living conditions, describe the destruction around them, and in some cases speak from the war&#x27;s frontlines - where they have gone to fight for their country.

Within this documentary, viewers will &quot;learn how a young and inexperienced team at UK development studio Rare were handed the James Bond licence, before making a game that would change the medium forever when it was released&quot;. 
This includes insights from the original GoldenEye 007 team, as well as those within the press that covered the game on its release (all the way back in 1997!) and saw their careers change as a result. It will also touch base with the many fans who played the game 25 years ago and discuss the resulting impact it had on them.

At the time, the developer said this delay was to ensure it delivers &quot;the best possible experience&quot; to players on its eventual launch. However, it has now been revealed that, as with other games, this delay was also due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
&quot;We had a bit of a weird thing with the multiplayer because... part of our team is based out in the Ukraine... So, we had to delay the multiplayer because they had to move,&quot; The Quarry creative director Will Byles told IGN.
&quot;We had to move the server from Kyiv up into Warsaw and those guys had to get out [of] there because it was obviously really dangerous.&quot;

                              <span>This is a new vulnerability against Apple’s M1 chip. Researchers say that it is unpatchable.
Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, however, have created a novel hardware attack, which combines memory corruption and speculative execution attacks to sidestep the security feature. The attack shows that pointer authentication can be defeated without leaving a trace, and as it utilizes a hardware mechanism, no software patch can fix it.
The attack, appropriately called “Pacman,” works by “guessing” a pointer authentication code (PAC), a cryptographic signature that confirms that an app hasn’t been maliciously altered. This is done using speculative execution—a technique used by modern computer processors to speed up performance by speculatively guessing various lines of computation—to leak PAC verification results, while a hardware side-channel reveals whether or not the guess was correct...</span>

                              <span>A new report by UK consumer watchdog Which? has claimed two in five Joy-Con controllers from the original version of the Switch are affected by persistent drift.


Switch has faced widespread complaints around Joy-Con controller drift since its launch in 2017, leading to class action lawsuits, and even EU calls for an investigation into the issue after it received more than 25,000 complaints from numerous countries. Reports were significant enough that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologised for the issue in 2020, which it&#x27;s since claimed to have &quot;improved&quot;.


More recently, a Kotaku report claimed Nintendo of America recieved &quot;thousands&quot; of faulty Joy-Cons each week at height of drift issues, and now UK consumer watchdog Which? has shared its own findings into the severity of the problem, claiming two in five (40 percent) of Joy-Con controllers from the original Switch are affected.

                              <span>When last we heard of Fallout 5, it was little more than a &quot;one-pager&quot; idea at Bethesda that may or may not come to fruition; however, studio director Todd Howard has now confirmed a new mainline entry in the beloved Fallout series is definitely happening, but won&#x27;t release until after The Elder Scrolls 6.


In conversation with IGN, Howard revealed The Elder Scrolls 6 is currently in pre-production (confirming previous rumours around the project&#x27;s progress), before adding, &quot;And, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate&#x27;s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.&quot;


In other words, with Bethesda&#x27;s next big title, sci-fi RPG Starfield, delayed until next year, and still no word on a potential release window for The Elder Scrolls 6 - despite the game having received its first official tease back in 2018 - it sounds like there&#x27;ll be an extremely long wait until Fallout 5 finally sees the light of day.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard - which continues its attempts to reassert itself following many months of shocking allegations it fostered a company culture where sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has confirmed Overwatch 2&#x27;s second closed beta will launch for PC and consoles on 28th June.


Blizzard first announced its intention to &quot;decouple&quot; Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvP and PvE modes and begin a series of multiplayer-focused betas back in March, and the first of these took place in April. That initial run gave participants a first look at Overwatch 2&#x27;s 5v5 gameplay, Push mode, four new maps, new hero Sojourn, and reworkings of Orisa, Doomfist, Bastion, and Sombra.


Round two, announced earlier today on Twitter, will shake things up a little further, giving players access to new tank hero Junker Queen and a new map. Blizzard is saving further details for a livestream airing this Thursday, 16th June, at 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PT, and says it&#x27;ll be discussing the game&#x27;s live-service model and seasonal content plan at the same time.

                              <span>Just a few days after the surprise arrival of Halo Infinite&#x27;s Pelican in Flight Simulator, developer Asobo is back with more goodies, this time in the form of a brand-new World Update that turns its attention back to the US for another stunning upgrade.
Asobo first targeted the US for a bit of a visual makeover in its second-ever World Update back in November 2020, introducing a significant number of improvements to the United States&#x27; multitudinous geological and man-made landmarks.
At the time, it said that the sheer size of the US meant it would eventually be revisiting the area, and now, seven World Updates later, that day has come.

                              <span>Over the weekend, Microsoft shared a list of 50 new titles heading to Game Pass over the next 12 months, and it&#x27;s now given a little more detail on one of those games - developer Iron Gate Studio&#x27;s acclaimed viking survival hit Valheim - confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for PC Game Pass this autumn with an Xbox release next spring.


Valheim, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched into Steam early access last February, and its refined viking survival action - which sees players exploring a gorgeous open-world, slowly preparing themselves to battle powerful creatures and prove themselves worthy of entering Valhalla - immediately drew critical acclaim.


It was also a massive sales hit too, managing to sell a staggering 4m copies in only three weeks. One year on, it&#x27;s shifted over 10 million copies on PC, and development continues apace, with work on its highly anticipated Mistlands update said to be &quot;well underway&quot;.

                              <span>After 18 months and an enormous offering of things to climb, stab, see and do, the mighty Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will wrap-up its free additions at the end of this year. 


Fans can look forward to seeing &quot;the last episode of the story of Eivor&quot; via a final free chapter - which will presumably tell the story of how our Norse heroine came to rest in Vinland. 


Before then, there&#x27;s a new Niflheim-set roguelite game mode named The Forgotten Saga coming this summer, and a final set of challenge vaults coming this autumn to conclude the game&#x27;s Tombs of the Fallen mystery. And, of course, there&#x27;s the game&#x27;s seasonal festivals. All of this content comes for free.

Bowser remains the only member of Louarn&#x27;s company Team Xecuter to be arrested, deported and now imprisoned in the US, for his part in the group&#x27;s sale of console mod devices that allowed people to play pirated games. Louarn, a French citizen, meanwhile lives in Avignon and was recently interviewed by Le Monde (paywall), via TorrentFreak.


&quot;I was&#x27;t going to end up as an engineer earning €5k a month when I realized, at 18, that hacking was not just fun, but that there was a way to make a lot of money,&quot; Louarn says, of how he got into the hacking game. &quot;Stealing from companies that make billions, what do I care?&quot;

                              <span>Tekken 2 was accidentally priced at almost $10k on the PSN store, catching the attention of Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada.


The PS1 classic fighter has been added to the store as part of the PS Plus subscription, but as Twitter user TheKBGamer spotted the game was incorrectly listed as costing $9999.


Harada shared the tweet joking &quot;what a marvellous price Sony&quot;. Presumably he would&#x27;ve Tekken quite the bonus at that price.

The Savvy Gaming Group (SGG), meanwhile, is a gaming-focused arm of the Saudi investment fund set up by the hugely controversial Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a bid to diversify and modernise the country&#x27;s foreign incomes.

A trailer for the crossover - a spoof of the Halo 3 &quot;Believe&quot; campaign - confirms a release date of 30th June. That&#x27;s a week after the game finally hits Xbox as a free-to-play game.



The event will seemingly last until 4th July and be available across all platforms: Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch.

The event, dubbed a &quot;Celebration Livestream&quot;, is yet another livestream in this never-ending not-E3 several week period - during which Ubisoft itself has kept noticeably quiet.


But what should we really expect tonight? It&#x27;s perhaps worth keeping expectations in check.

&quot;Switch players - the game needs a little more polish time. We&#x27;re working to get the Switch version out in July, and we&#x27;ll have an updated release date for you as soon as we can!&quot; reads a tweet from the official account.

                              <span>Tactics Ogre: Reborn has leaked on to the PlayStation store, along with new artwork.

Back in April, Square Enix trademarked the name in Japan sparking rumours of a remake.


This leak suggests the remake is real, although a PSN listing that&#x27;s since been removed (thanks Escapist) offers no gameplay or release date details.

The 12-minute event was announced by Capcom in its main showcase last night.


 The fact Capcom has put together a whole show for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma has fans of the cult RPG very excited. Well, excited and annoyed Capcom just didn&#x27;t announce a sequel then and there.

The free upgrades, released after the Capcom showcase, are across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and include ray-tracing, 4K support, higher framerates, and 3D audio.



However, the minimum requirements on PC have been raised and Capcom notes that &quot;once the upgrade patch has been applied, the game cannot be restored to the previous version even if the game is uninstalled.&quot;

                              <span>Capcom has played down reports that long-running Street Fighter character Fei Long can no longer appear in the famous fighting game franchise due to a clash with the Bruce Lee estate.


Fei Long, originally created for 1993&#x27;s Super Street Fighter 2 as one of four new challengers, is heavily-inspired by real-life movie martial arts legend Bruce Lee.


Last month, Street Fighter 5 composer Daniel Lindholm suggested Fei Long may no longer feature in the series because the Lee Bruce estate insists depictions of the Enter the Dragon star must be &quot;honourable&quot;, rather than humourous in the wake of the &quot;comedy&quot; cameo in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

                              <span>Interesting vulnerability in Tesla’s NFC key cards:
Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, quickly noticed something odd about the new feature: Not only did it allow the car to automatically start within 130 seconds of being unlocked with the NFC card, but it also put the car in a state to accept entirely new keys­with no authentication required and zero indication given by the in-car display.
“The authorization given in the 130-second interval is too general… [it’s] not only for drive,” Herfurt said in an online interview. “This timer has been introduced by Tesla… in order to make the use of the NFC card as a primary means of using the car more convenient. What should happen is that the car can be started and driven without the user having to use the key card a second time. The problem: within the 130-second period, not only the driving of the car is authorized, but also the [enrolling] of a new key.”...</span>

                              <span>We knew they were coming, but Capcom has announced its PS5 and Xbox Series X/S spruce-ups of Resident Evil 2, 3 and 7 will launch today, 13th June.


All three titles - which is to say, the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes, plus Resident Evil 7 - will feature support for 4K resolution, &quot;high&quot; framerates, ray tracing, and 3D audio.


Players yet to experience the games will be able to purchase the newly updated Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions from their respective stores, but existing owners on Xbox One and PS4 can grab the updates relevant to their platform at no additional cost. Saves will also transfer.

She&#x27;ll feature in the arcade-style The Mercenaries: Additional Orders mode, as well as Chris Redfield and Karl Heisenberg. Mind your head though - you&#x27;ll need to duck down through doorways as you slash enemies from nine feet above.


The Mercenaries mode is one of three major additions in this Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC, due out on 28th October this year.

The new demo will give players the opportunity to explore Sunbreak&#x27;s newly revealed jungle locale, a twist on the area first encountered in 2006&#x27;s Monster Hunter 2, complete with new elements and endemic life. Here they can test their mettle against flying wyvern Astalos (from Monster Hunter Generations), a Great Izuchi, a Tetranadon, plus an especially challenging version of Sunbreak&#x27;s flagship monster Malzeno.


It&#x27;ll also let players try out Sunbreak&#x27;s new Switch Skill Swap system, new Silkbind attacks, and a variety of handy tutorials.

                              <span>Bethesda has slapped a new release window on Fallout 76&#x27;s previously announced The Pitt expansion, confirming the Fallout-3-inspired update will arrive some time this September.


Fallout 76&#x27;s The Pitt expansion was annouced for a 2022 release last June, and its arrival date was narrowed down a little further, specifically to this &quot;autumn&quot;, as part of February&#x27;s 2022 roadmap. Last night&#x27;s Xbox showcase, though, saw it inching even closer to receiving a proper release date, with its new gameplay trailer heralding a September launch.


The Pitt - inspired by the second add-on released for 2008&#x27;s much-loved Fallout 3 - will arrive as part of Fallout 76&#x27;s Season 10 update in September, and marks the first time players will be able to travel beyond the boundaries of Appalachia in the online game.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s big Starfield gameplay reveal, Bethesda has re-emerged with a few additional details regarding its highly anticipated sci-fi RPG, confirming that dialogue scenes will be presented in first-person throughout, and that the main character won&#x27;t be voiced.


If you&#x27;re only familiar with Bethesda games prior to Fallout 4, that probably won&#x27;t seem like all that big a deal, given that mute protagonists and lengthy first-person conversations with dead-eyed NPCs were par for the course in Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, and Oblivion.


It&#x27;s really only notable when you factor in Fallout 4; here, Bethesda opted for a slightly more cinematic approach to its story telling, switching to third-person perspective during dialogue scenes and introducing a fully voiced protagonist - the latter drawing complaints from fans that felt the decision had forced the developer to limit the breadth and depth of conversation options compared to those seen in previous games.

                              <span>Yesterday, Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4, the game that&#x27;s not Diablo Immoral (sorry, I meant Immortal), will launch for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S next year. Since this news came to light, some have been voicing concerns that Diablo 4 may go down the same route as Diablo Immortal and have some kind of mobile-like monetisation and microtransactions attached to it. 
In response, several of its developers have swiftly jumped in to try and quell any anxiety within the Diablo community.
&quot;To be clear, [Diablo 4] is a full price game built for PC/PS/Xbox audiences,&quot; franchise exec Rod Fergusson tweeted yesterday.

                              <span>The US launch of PlayStation Plus Premium has begun, and Sony has added many more titles to the service versus its previous rollout in parts of Asia.


This includes dozens more games for the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium&#x27;s game catalogue of PS4 and PS5 titles, such as: Dead Cells, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Frostpunk: Console Edition, John Wick Hex, Little Nightmares, Nioh, Prey, Shenmue 3, Soulcalibur 6, Surgeon Simulator, Telling Lies, Tropico 5, Trine 4, plus The Dark Pictures Anthology&#x27;s Little Hope and Man of Medan. 


The list of games available in the US looks to be a large upgrade from the list of games available in Hong Kong, for example. But there are some games (Journey to the Savage Planet) listed as available in Asia but not in the US.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 was the highlight of last week&#x27;s not-E3, with playable booths at Summer Game Fest drawing the biggest crowds while the developers were on-hand to answer questions and outline specifics of the return of Capcom&#x27;s beloved series. Well, they&#x27;ve been answering some questions, while some other areas still remain bizarrely unclear. 


Crossplay has been a hope for the game since its reveal - something supported on Street Fighter 5 across PC and PlayStation, with Street Fighter 6 promising to bring Xbox players into the fold - and early reports from showgoers including fighting game YouTuber Maximillian Dood seemingly confirmed it would be included.


When pushed for clarity on the issue, however, Capcom was unwilling to confirm the matter. &quot;In terms of crossplay we&#x27;re going to have more information and more specifics to share down the line,&quot; a Capcom representative told Eurogamer at Summer Game Fest. &quot;It&#x27;s something we feel strongly about but in terms of actual specifics that will come at a later time.&quot;

The first of these, Flux, will drop in July and detail the arrival of a refugee flotilla to Erlin&#x27;s Eye. It&#x27;s a plotline that will continue in October with a second free DLC release, then conclude sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Kojima Productions has issued a statement to fans addressing its future with Sony, following yesterday&#x27;s confirmation that Hideo Kojima was now working on a project for Xbox.


Of course, Kojima most recently partnered with PlayStation for Death Stranding - and fans of that game are now expecting a Death Stranding sequel, thanks to the loose lips of actor and star Norman Reedus. 


Kojima&#x27;s partnership with Sony was a major coup for PlayStation, and was announced with glee by its then-head Andy House. Kojima&#x27;s appearance on last night&#x27;s Microsoft and Bethesda Showcase, introduced by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, held similar vibes.

This news did not come with an official statement or announcement. Rather, following Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s showcase last night, Xbox released a tweet detailing all its upcoming games for the next 12 months. 
As you can see below, this image shows Stalker 2 on the right-hand side, which denotes the games releasing in the first half of 2023.

                              <span>ENCSecurity markets a file encryption system, and it’s used by SanDisk, Sony, Lexar, and probably others. Despite it using AES as its algorithm, it’s implementation is flawed in multiple ways—and breakable.
The moral is, as it always is, that implementing cryptography securely is hard. Don’t roll your own anything if you can help it.</span>

As well as the date and a new gameplay trailer - see below - there&#x27;s news that Terri Brosius - the voice of Viktoria from Thief and Shodan from System Shock - will feature.

                              <span>We may not have got the James Bond Goldeneye announcement that we were all expecting at Microsoft and Bethesda’s showcase earlier this evening, but we did get another look at something pretty damn close to it at the PC Gaming Show – Replicant D6’s Agent 64: Spies Never Die. And not only did we get to see some more of this glorious gameplay in motion, we also got the news that its demo is now available to download on Steam.
The full game is slated to release sometime this year, although at the time of writing no further specifics were given.
Agent 64: Spies Never Die is all very James Bond GoldenEye a la the Nintendo 64 era, from the music and the weapons to the settings. There is even footage of the shooter - I assume the titular Agent 64 - finishing someone off in a toilet stall. Small me is very happy to see this and will most likely be heading to Steam to download the demo once I have finished work for the evening. You can check out the new trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>Last May, developer Ion Lands got fans of its gorgeous Blade-Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk a little bit giddy with the announcement of new life-sim spin-off Nivalis, and now, a little over a year on, the developer has given a first look at the game in action.


Cloudpunk, which released back in 2020, was an experience I enjoyed a lot after it received a number of much-needed post-launch nips and tucks, revelling in the chance to play out all my Blade Runner fantasies by careening around its stunningly designed, neon-drenched futuristic city of Nivalis in my trusty flying car.


The biggest disappointment was that Nivalis proved to be rather lifeless at ground level, which is where Cloudpunk&#x27;s spin-off comes in, attempting to turn the city from a pretty backdrop into a rich, meaningful world of its own as you attempt to build a business up from scratch.

That date was revealed this evening during a fresh trailer for Immortality, shown during this year&#x27;s PC Gaming Show. As previously announced, the title will launch on Xbox directly into Game Pass.


Immortality is an investigative horror game where you sift through footage from three (fictional) classic films which starred the (also fictional) actress Marissa Marcel, in order to discover her fate.

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind the acclaimed likes of Frostpunk and This War of Mine, has unveiled its latest project, sci-fi survival adventure The Alters.


Unfortunately, it&#x27;s early days as far as specifics go, with the bulk of 11 Bit&#x27;s reveal taking the form of a cinematic trailer - one immediately bringing Duncan Jones&#x27; celebrated sci-fi movie Moon to mind. You see, in The Alters, players take on the role of Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant planet, ensconced in a roving wheel-like base, with a bunch of alternative versions of himself known as Alters. Ultimately, the goal is to stay alive long enough to find a way back home by creating new Alters, each of who have different skills essential for survival.


&quot;The Alters is a game about life-changing moments,&quot; explains The Alters&#x27; new Steam page. &quot;Those binary decisions that happen in nanoseconds, but have influence over your entire life. It is about looking into yourself, into your past, and discovering that you are who you are as a sum of those numerous choices. And when you do that a fundamental question arises: WHAT IF...?&quot;.

                              <span>Announced during tonight&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Showcase, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a new project from Team Ninja which will arrive in early 2023 and launch for PC and Xbox Game Pass.


Specifically, it&#x27;s being led by producers Fumihiko Yasuda (of Nioh fame) and Masaaki Yamagiwa (Bloodborne). 


Set in the Later Han Dynasty - or a version of it where demons exist - you play as a nameless soldier skilled in Chinese martial arts. Here&#x27;s a first trailer - what do you think?

                              <span>It&#x27;s taken over four years of concerted pleading, but Sea of Thieves players will finally be able to name their own ships from July, when the multiplayer pirate adventures very-long-awaited Captaincy Update arrives as part of Season Seven.


First discussed prior to Sea of Thieves&#x27; launch, the Captaincy Update was originally set to be one of the game&#x27;s first post-launch updates, giving Pirate Legends the ability create their own legendary ship and forge a fearsome identity for themselves on the waves. They&#x27;d also start each session within the Legendary Hideout, blasting through its waterfall to make a grand entrance on the main map.


Unfortunately, following Sea of Thieves&#x27; rocky launch, Rare announced it would be placing the Captaincy update &quot;on the back burner&quot; while it refocussed its development. Since then, the Captaincy update has become the stuff of legends itself, many assuming it was lost to time.

                              <span>If you like mournfully hopping around a mysterious world as a little person solving puzzles, you might like the sound of Cocoon: it&#x27;s a deeply handsome puzzle-platforming indie from Jeppe Carlsen, the gameplay designer of Limbo and Inside.
You play as a kind of fly-person, who carries various glowing spheres around various exotic worlds. It&#x27;s wonderfully moody, the opening desert hinting at some Sable-like vibes before we move on to a range of other ones, &quot;worlds within worlds&quot; as the blurb puts it. Even from just the trailer you get the sense there&#x27;s some real cleverness to the puzzle-platforming to go with it.
Looks good! You can &quot;unravel a cosmic mystery&quot; in it next year, as it&#x27;s coming 2023, like an awful lot of games it seems, on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass.

                              <span>Starfield&#x27;s delay was some of the biggest news to come this year, but alas not a surprise. After all, we had only been shown concept art with every teaser so far. Thankfully though, we now have our first look at some actual gameplay.
The gameplay starts off on the mysterious moon of Kreet and sees robot companion VASCO making his way out of the starship. Then, of course, we see some aliens, other space things and some combat. All the while, the swelling score is ticking along nicely in the background. We also pop over to New Atlantis at one point.
But you&#x27;re not here to listen to me waffling on. You&#x27;re here to see it for yourself. So, without further ado, here is our first look at gameplay for Starfield.

Details were thin on the ground - really, there was nothing here which had not been reported already - but tonight Microsoft made it official. 


Kojima is working on a brand new project with Xbox which will harness the company&#x27;s cloud technology. If this sounds familiar, well, it&#x27;s a promise we&#x27;ve heard before, and a detail which first found its way online last summer, when whispers of Kojima working with Microsoft first hit the internet.

                              <span>We didn&#x27;t see this one coming: renowned role-playing game developer Obsidian is releasing a brand new game called Pentiment this November on Xbox consoles, PC and the cloud.
It&#x27;s a narrative-focused murder mystery set in medieval times, and the action takes place on the pages of an era-appropriate book. It certainly looks different to everything else out there.
The game is led by Obsidian star director Josh Sawyer (Fallout: new Vegas, Pillars of Eternity) and is apparently an idea he pitched years and years ago at Black Isle Studios, according to IGN, which interviewed Sawyer about his new game.

Grounded has been available in early access for PC and Xbox since July 2020, miniaturising players - in true Honey, I Shrunk the Kids fashion - down to bug height and sending them off on an 80s-themed survival adventure through an ordinary backyard.


There&#x27;s building, crafting, spiders the size of trucks (at least from your miniaturised perspective), and a whole lot more to experience as you - along with a couple of friends if you like - fight to find a way to return to human size.

It&#x27;s a turn-based grand strategy game, from Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games, and the angle seems to be: Civilization, but with an emphasis on alternate history.
Think snow-capped Pyramids, steampunk future-cities, and blimps, of course, because who doesn&#x27;t love a good blimp.

                              <span>Minecraft maker Mojang has revealed a new action strategy spin-off for its sandbox franchise: Minecraft Legends, developed with Blackbird Interactive. 


Described as an action strategy game, this 2023 release sees you run about slashing away at Minecraft enemies in a bid to unite Minecraft&#x27;s overworld, whatever that means. 


Still, it looks intriguing and if it&#x27;s half as fun as Mojang&#x27;s Minecraft Dungeons, will be worth a try. As you&#x27;d expect, it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and will launch for PC via Windows Store and Steam, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

                              <span>Microsoft showed a new trailer for A Plage Tale: Requiem during the Games Showcase today, giving us another rare look at gameplay in the upcoming sequel, due sometime this year on Xbox Consoles, PC and Game Pass at launch. It&#x27;s also coming to PS5 but obviously Microsoft glossed over that bit.
The thing that really stuck out to me, a fan of the first game, was stabbing. Amicia, the returning older sister of brother Hugo, and our hero, can now approach enemies from the back and stealth-kill them, reaching over and stabbing them multiple times in the neck - the kind of gruesome move we&#x27;ve seen many times in other stealth combat games. Except A Plague Tale, the first game, wasn&#x27;t really a stealth combat game - it was more about running away and hiding and being smart. That&#x27;s what made it stand out. 
Amicia also packs a crossbow in the sequel, which she uses, and she can garrotte people with some chord. All she had in the first game was a slingshot, which wasn&#x27;t entirely capable of one-shot kills. It was more of a utility/distraction tool.

Microsoft hasn&#x27;t revealed how the Pelican will fit into the overall Flight Simulator experience just yet, but you can get a gimpse of the ship in the trailer below. It&#x27;s a different story for the free 40th Anniversary Edition update, however, which has been detailed in significantly more detail.
Described as a &quot;comprehensive celebration of the franchise&quot;, it promises to pay tribute to the series&#x27; past as well as introduce new aircraft types. The latter additions include the long-awaited arrival of helicopters and gliders, brought to life with a new Fluid Dynamics Simulation.

                              <span>As part of Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s showcase this evening, the next Forza Motorsport was finally announced. And, we also now have an idea of when it will be zooming our way - spring 2023. On its release it will be coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC. As well as this, Forza Motorsport will also be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription service on day one.
Along with this announcement, Dan Greenawalt and the game&#x27;s director Chris Esaki popped in for a chat about their game. It&#x27;s the most technically advanced racing game ever apparently, so that&#x27;s exciting. We also got told about its dynamic time of day feature, the weather for each track and the inclusion of raytracing. This was all shown off with a clip from the fictional circuit known as Maple Valley.
The twosome also says there&#x27;s a 48x improvement in the accuracy of the simulation - but, as Martin has asked, what does that mean, and how does it feel? I guess we won&#x27;t find out for a while.

                              <span>It feels like there&#x27;s been an awful lot of horror at this year&#x27;s Game Fest thing in Los Angeles. Today Xbox got in on the act opening its showcase with a proper look at Redfall, the co-op shooter about blasting vampires and cultists.


Redfall&#x27;s the work of Arkane Austin, and today&#x27;s overview mixed up a bit of gameplay with a look at the playable characters. We start approaching a spooky church and then head up into the spire where vampires are leaping about. Shotguns and nice vampire-burning-up effects ensue, and then we&#x27;re off to learn a bit about the town.


The titular Redfall is an island community in Massachusets apparently, but now the whole place has gone to heck. Vampires have blocked out the sun, drained all the water, and cut the town off. (Wouldn&#x27;t draining the water do the opposite?) Expect spooky Americana, like a funfair and an old cinema which appears to have the wilderness growing inside. Expect Left 4 Dead-type action as you take on different enemy types.

Taking you to Alaska in 2062, the &quot;thrilling, heart-racing&quot; teaser gives an idea of what the game will have in store for us when it releases on consoles and PC (including Mac) in 2023. 

&quot;Arctic Awakening is a narrative adventure, where your choices affect the decisions of those around you. Your actions will change your relationship with your companions and even your story itself,&quot; the studio explains, hinting that the environment itself is a character that is &quot;not always on your side&quot;.

Metacritic - which pulls together the scores of both professional critics and everyday players - ranks Diablo Immortal PC&#x27;s release 12451 out of 12451, making it the most unpopular PC game on record (thanks, VGC). When compared with other mobile games it fares a little better, but not much: there, it&#x27;s 1903 out of 1921.

                              <span>Tiny Magicians has revealed its upcoming survival game, Outbreak Island, is coming to Steam sometime between July to September 2022.

The survival game - which also boasts detective elements - will initially release in Early Access. The team also confirmed that a free prologue, which gives players &quot;a chance to test the game&#x27;s core mechanics&quot;, is &quot;coming soon&quot;.
