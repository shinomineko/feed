                    <span>Marvelous and Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s cult-hack-and-slash adventures No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle are heading to Steam next Wednesday, 9th June.
First released on Wii in 2007, No More Heroes follows the stylish, frequently ludicrous, and dependably ultra-violent adventures of Travis Touchdown, an ordinary game and anime geek who inadvertently becomes embroiled with the United Assassins Association.
What follows is a third-person hack-and-slash romp, replete with a phenomenal soundtrack, that sees Travis - lightsaber-like beam Katana in hand - murdering his way through the Association&#x27;s top-ranked assassins in order to stay alive. If you&#x27;ve never played the game before, expect geysers of blood, a winningly weird sense of humour, and (rather barren) bike-based open-world interludes in amongst the spirited and largely entertaining action.

                    <span>Following its surprise appearance during a fiscal year financial presentation last week, publisher 505 Games has confirmed that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the acclaimed 2019 Castlevania spiritual successor from Koji Igarashi and developer ArtPlay, is getting a sequel.
Word of a sequel originally surfaced after keen-eyed internet sorts spotted a bullet point inserted into 505 Games&#x27; latest fiscal year financial results, stating a &quot;second version&quot; of  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was in development.
Although the term &quot;second version&quot; left a certain ambiguity as to whether this was referring to a sequel or something else, 505 has now offered clarity in a development update on Reddit. &quot;Regarding recent reports,&quot; it wrote, &quot;[505 Games and Artplay] are in very early planning stages for a Bloodstained sequel&quot;.

                    <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick, which will once again be an online-only event due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, starts in exactly one month&#x27;s time, on 4th July, and in preparation, organisers have shared the full charity speedrun schedule.
2021 marks the second year running that Summer Games Done Quick is going online-only - traditionally, shows have been ticketed real-world events, with all speedrunning showcases being streamed online - and the precautions established last year will remain in place to &quot;ensure the continued safety of our attendees, runners, volunteers, and staff&quot;, according to organisers.
Even without the live-event element, there&#x27;s still plenty to look forward to, with this year&#x27;s show offering a full seven days of speedrunning, from Sunday, 4th July, to 11th July.

                    <span>Earlier this year, CD Projekt confirmed it had been hit by a &quot;targeted cyber attack&quot; that saw its internal systems compromised and sensitive information held to ransom. After CD Projekt said it would not comply with the group&#x27;s demands, the hackers announced that source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent and an unreleased version of The Witcher 3 would be auctioned to the highest bidder, and source code for Gwent was publicly leaked. 
At the time, the hackers claimed they had received a satisfying offer for the information, and the auction was then closed with a condition of &quot;no further distribution&quot; agreed with the buyer. But that stolen data now appears to have resurfaced, with source code, assets and software development kits for platforms including the PlayStation 5 seemingly being shared online. Eurogamer has also seen internal development videos showing work-in-progress builds of Cyberpunk 2077. 
According to security blog DataBreaches.net, earlier this week a threat actor group decided to release CD Projekt&#x27;s information in order to promote its new leaks platform. A note from the hackers was also discovered by security software provider Emsisoft back in March (via IT Pro), and an uncensored version of this was shared on 4chan yesterday (the link provided in the note no longer works, but the data is now being shared elsewhere). The note claims the release of the stolen information is part of a &quot;charity fundraising&quot; effort - although as the group is asking for payment in cryptocurrency, there&#x27;s no way to guarantee that&#x27;s actually going to a good cause.

Its parent company Koch Media plans a livestream with new announcements for Summer Games Fest, but Deep Silver&#x27;s games will not be a part of it, or any other E3 2021 event.
&quot;We&#x27;ll let you know when we have news to share,&quot; the Deep Silver Twitter account said.

                    <span>New Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players now need to pay for ranked play, Valve has announced.
Previously, new players of the free-to-play competitive first-person shooter had access to drops, ranks, skill groups, and a free path to Prime (paid) matchmaking.
Valve said that over time, these benefits had become &quot;an incentive for bad actors to hurt the experience of both new and existing players&quot;.

                    <span>The developer of Injustice 2 Mobile has apologised for a Pride event that challenged players to beat up a queer woman.
The mobile version of NetherRealm&#x27;s fighting game was accused of being &quot;tone deaf&quot; after an in-game challenge designed to celebrate Pride Month tasked players with defeating canonically bisexual character Poison Ivy hundreds of thousands of times.
Rewards for completing the community challenge included Harley Quinn tokens - a nod to Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn&#x27;s romantic relationship in DC Comics.

                    <span>Today is the second day of the fourteenth Workshop on Security and Human Behavior. The University of Cambridge is the host, but we’re all on Zoom.
SHB is a small, annual, invitational workshop of people studying various aspects of the human side of security, organized each year by Alessandro Acquisti, Ross Anderson, and myself. The forty or so attendees include psychologists, economists, computer security researchers, sociologists, political scientists, criminologists, neuroscientists, designers, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, business school professors, and a smattering of others. It’s not just an interdisciplinary event; most of the people here are individually interdisciplinary...</span>

                    <span>Sony has once again turned its attention to virtual reality of the PlayStation kind, with another of its PSVR showcases - and if you missed its various announcements, you can catch up below.
First up, Sniper Elite VR - unsurprisingly a virtual reality spin on developer Rebellion&#x27;s long-range FPS series - will be launching on 8th July. The studio is promising a &quot;powerful World War 2 story&quot; told through the eyes of an Italian Partisan, said to deliver a &quot;new perspective&quot; on the franchise&#x27;s acclaimed stealth and sniping action.
Next up is a reveal for new game Wanderer, created by M Theory and Oddboy. This one&#x27;s an immersive time travel adventure - melding narrative-driven exploration, puzzling, and mini-games - in which you&#x27;re able to embody some of history&#x27;s most famous explorers, inventors, and conquerors as you hop back and forth between ancient civilisations, war time, the hippie-hued 60s, even the far flung, post-apocalyptic future. Wanderer is due to arrive this summer.

                    <span>Rust is infamous for having a pretty hostile player base - something I learned the hard way when I first started playing - but a change arriving this month could make it easier to avoid your worst neighbours. A new &quot;contact system&quot; is being rolled out as part of Rust&#x27;s June update, and it will highlight those who have done bad things to you. 
&quot;Upon meeting a new player they&#x27;ll be logged into your contacts and the contact system will now keep a history of all interactions (good, bad, indifferent, rage-inducing etc),&quot; Facepunch explained in a press release. &quot;To help quickly identify friend from foe, players&#x27; nameplates will now display blue for friendly and red for hostile. Waving at players will reveal your name (it doesn&#x27;t always pay to be nice...) and using binoculars will reveal if a player is unknown, hostile or friendly from large distances.&quot;
On the surface, it sounds similar to the way hostile players are marked in Red Dead Online with a red dot or star depending on their recent actions. With Rust, however, it seems like it will be up to the individual to categorise other players: you can designate someone as an enemy, for instance, and make notes on each player you meet. Seems like a handy way to keep track of all those nakeds.

                    <span>Frontier has released a second major update for space sim Elite Dangerous&#x27; poorly received Odyssey expansion, bringing a raft of much-needed improvements, ranging from UI enhancements and graphics optimisations to AI tweaks and many, many bug fixes.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched last month, quickly accruing a &#x27;Mostly Negative&#x27; rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.
As the negative reviews continued, Frontier Developments boss David Braben stepped in, releasing a statement apologising &quot;to those who have been suffering from these problems&quot; and insisting that addressing Odyssey&#x27;s myriad reported issues was the studio&#x27;s &quot;priority and focus.&quot;

                    <span>Games Workshop kicked off its Warhammer Skulls event with a raft of video game announcements alongside new trailers and images. Strap yourself in, there&#x27;s a lot of Warhammer stuff in here.
First up is the reveal of Total War: Warhammer 2&#x27;s final DLC, which reworks the poor old Beastmen.
Creative Assembly didn&#x27;t stop there. The UK developer announced Skarbrand as a Legendary Lord for Khorne in the upcoming Total War: Warhammer 3.

                    <span>Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Warhammer 2&#x27;s final DLC: The Silence and The Fury.
The DLC, due out in July, reworks the Beastmen race &quot;to more closely match their intended playstyle and address their previous issues with horde gameplay&quot;, Creative Assembly said.
&quot;With a big focus on progression the Beastmen have a much more engaging and lasting experience.&quot;

                    <span>Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate is coming back with a new game nearly 25 years after the last one.
Elite developer Frontier announced it is publishing Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters on PC in 2022. It&#x27;s a turn-based tactical RPG that sees the player lead the Grey Knights, one of the most secret chapters of Space Marines from the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The teaser trailer is below:
Frontier is publishing Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters under its Frontier Foundry games label. The game itself is developed by Canadian studio Complex Games, which has previously focused on mobile games such as The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault.

Ubisoft Forward, which is set for 8pm UK time on 12th June, will showcast the game formerly known as Rainbow Six Quarantine. 
Over an hour of gameplay from Rainbow Six Quarantine leaked from a technical test in March. (Then, the game was referred to as its codename: Rainbow Six: Parasite.) Ubisoft said the Quarantine name will change as a result of the ongoing pandemic.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been casting a curious eye at developer 11 Bit Studios&#x27; celebrated post-apocalyptic city builder Frostpunk but have yet to experience its brutal survival charms, now&#x27;s the perfect time to do so, as it&#x27;s currently free on the Epic Games Store.
Frostpunk, which launched to much acclaim in 2018, is a fascinating, if decidedly gruelling, experience. It&#x27;s a sort of narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder, challenging players to stay alive and, as much as is possible in Frostpunk&#x27;s desolate sub-zero world, thrive.
That&#x27;s done by establishing a settlement with a vast generator at its centre, a precariously fuel-hungry device intended to provide some degree of warmth for your population as, at your command, they set about scavenging the land for supplies needed to expand their new home.

                    <span>Crowfall, a player versus player MMO you can win and lose, finally has a release date: 6th July. And you can gain immediate access to it now by signing up for the beta.
It&#x27;s an MMO I&#x27;ve been following since it Kickstarted in 2015 (after which it raised more money via player investment and in-game property sales), and one I&#x27;ve played a bit of recently. It&#x27;s a slightly tricky one to explain.
In general, it&#x27;s an online fantasy game about fighting other players. That is the point. There&#x27;s a bit of monster fighting, but only really to serve as a tutorial while you quickly level up. There&#x27;s a level-cap of 30 which you can get quite close to in a few hours if you&#x27;re speedy.

Alongside concrete press conference details already announced separately by certain companies (Microsoft, Ubisoft, Nintendo), there are mentions of various publisher presentations which will slot into E3 2021 programming.
Hopefully we&#x27;ll get a clearer timeframe for everything over the next week.

                    <span>Over the past few months, Apex Legends players have increasingly reported problems with DDoS attacks in their games: one moment they&#x27;ve been sliding their way around World&#x27;s Edge, the next, their game has frozen and they&#x27;ve been booted out. It&#x27;s become a particular issue in Ranked games, where miscreants have used DDoS attacks to artificially boost themselves up the leaderboards. Hoovering up a bunch of disconnected opponents is easier than actually playing the game, after all. 
Respawn has already indicated it&#x27;s taking the situation seriously - banning some behind high-profile cases, and mentioning that it&#x27;s even considering legal action against those carrying out the attacks. But it seems progress is being made towards a more permanent solution, with security analyst Conor &quot;Hideouts&quot; Ford explaining on Twitter that significant progress has been made on a fix. 
&quot;The DDoS situation is being addressed as we speak by our very own @ricklesauceur [lead software engineer Samy Duc],&quot; Ford said. &quot;It isn&#x27;t the easiest fix in the world but huge steps are being made to take care of this.&quot;

We already know Lego Super Luigi will launch on 1st August, so we&#x27;re likely to see what&#x27;s next for the range - and presumably the next vast wave of accompanying bits and pieces due alongside Mario&#x27;s brother. Birdo please.

                    <span>Bend Studio, perhaps best known as the developer behind 2019&#x27;s post-apocalyptic bikes-and-zombies adventure Days Gone, has revealed it&#x27;s working on a new IP.
Days Gone - which initially launched on PS4 before making it way to PC earlier this year - was the studio&#x27;s first crack at a new IP since its acquisition by Sony in 2000; prior to that game, the developer was largely known for adapting the likes of Uncharted and Resistance for Sony&#x27;s handheld consoles, the PSP and Vita.
Announcing its next project in a statement on Twitter,  Bend wrote, &quot;We are beyond grateful for your support with Days Gone and are truly honoured by the amount of passion our community has shared with us for our world and characters. Your enthusiasm motivates us to continue to improve and create experiences that will last a lifetime.&quot;

                    <span>God of War: Ragnarok, which was originally announced for a PlayStation 5 release in 2021, has been delayed into next year, and will now also launch on PS4 .
Confirming the news on Twitter, developer Sony Santa Monica Studio explained it had made the decision to push God of War: Ragnarok&#x27;s release back into 2022 in order to maintain the &quot;safety and wellbeing&quot; of its team.
&quot;Since the release of the next God of War teaser last year,&quot; the full statement reads, &quot;we&#x27;ve been humbled by the amount of love our community has show us.

                    <span>Nintendo will hold its big E3 Nintendo Direct on 15th June at 5pm UK time. 
The showcase will run for 40 minutes and focus &quot;exclusively on Nintendo Switch software&quot;, the company said, nodding to the rampant reports of an imminent Switch hardware reveal. 
Of course, we&#x27;re expecting that Nintendo Switch hardware reveal before E3 itself, paving the way for Nintendo and other developers to focus specifically on games during E3.

The mobile version of the currently PC-only free-to-play competitive first-person shooter, which now has more than 14 million players each month, is in the works, but Riot did not say when it will come out, or reveal any images or gameplay.
Valorant launched on PC a year ago, on 2nd June 2020. Riot said it&#x27;s working on expanding the franchise, starting with Valorant Mobile, &quot;in order to bring Valorant to more players around the world.&quot;

                    <span>Hello Games&#x27; ceaselessly evolving exploratory space sim No Man&#x27;s Sky has just received another free update on all platforms; it&#x27;s called Prisms, and brings sweeping visual enhancements to the already striking sci-fi sandbox.
Prisms, No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s 17th named update since its release back in 2016, touches up the game&#x27;s visual presentation pretty much across the board. Planets, for instance, get enhanced weather effects - Hello Games highlights rain, which now refracts the light and causes surfaces to become slick and wet - while underground caves become more detailed, with improved lighting and volumetric fog.
Planetary fauna, meanwhile, has been overhauled with proper fur effects and, as a bonus, flying creatures - which were sadly neglected in No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s taming-based Companions update - can now be adopted and ridden through the sky.

&quot;As far as I know no one ever stumbled upon it,&quot; Boisvert wrote.

                    <span>Biomutant developer Experiment 101 has, as promised, released an update for the game that makes significant changes.
Chief among them is the ability to shut the annoying narrator up. Biomutant&#x27;s incorporeal narrator is certainly pretty chatty, commenting on pretty much everything you do and translating everything anyone says. Prior to the release of this patch, while you were able to tone the narrator down, you couldn&#x27;t shut him up completely. Now you can.
Here are the relevant patch notes:

                    <span>Nintendo has announced plans to open one of its former production facilities to the public from 2024.
Renovations on the building are now underway to transform the factory into a &quot;Nintendo Gallery&quot; where products from throughout the company&#x27;s history will be showcased, alongside exhibits and other experiences (thanks, Nintendo Life).
The site was formerly Nintendo&#x27;s Uji Oguru Plant, a facility originally built in 1969 to print Hanafuda cards, before it became a customer service centre for product repairs.

                    <span>Fans of the legendary Super Mario Bros. movie have restored a more adult version of the film, with 20 minutes of deleted scenes. 
The cut footage was found back in 2019 via an old VHS tape, but was in poor quality. Since then, a group has worked on restoring the long-lost version, which is now available to watch in full via the Internet Archive.
As officially released, Super Mario Bros. was 104 minutes. This new version - dubbed the Morton Jankel Cut in honour of its husband and wife director team - runs 125 minutes, with most scenes extended.

                    <span>SNK has delayed King of Fighters 15 to the first quarter of 2022, it&#x27;s announced. The fighting game was due out at some point this year.
In a message to fans, producer Yasuyuki Oda said the ongoing struggle with coronavirus in Japan had set development back.
&quot;The development timeline we set out to reach in the beginning has been affected by the ever-still rising cases of COVID-19 within Japan,&quot; Oda said.

                    <span>The New York Times has a long story on the DarkSide ransomware gang.
A glimpse into DarkSide’s secret communications in the months leading up to the Colonial Pipeline attack reveals a criminal operation on the rise, pulling in millions of dollars in ransom payments each month.
DarkSide offers what is known as “ransomware as a service,” in which a malware developer charges a user fee to so-called affiliates like Woris, who may not have the technical skills to actually create ransomware but are still capable of breaking into a victim’s computer systems...</span>

                    <span>Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis, the standalone-expansion-style next instalment in Sega&#x27;s long-running free-to-play online action-RPG series, will - following its beta last month - be making its way to Xbox and PC next Wednesday, 9th June.
Announced last summer, New Genesis is described as the &quot;next-generation&quot; of Phantasy Star Online 2, and catapults the action forward 1,000 years after the Oracle&#x27;s battle in PSO2.
Bundled alongside the base game, it includes a new graphics engine, enhanced character models, a new multi-weapon system, and, most notably, a &quot;wide-open battlefield&quot; with changing time and weather, traversable using new abilities like the Photon Dash and Photon Glide. There&#x27;s also cross-platform play, plus fully localised text and character voices in English.

                    <span>All three episodes of Life is Strange developer Dontnod&#x27;s well-received supernatural mystery adventure Tell Me Why are currently free on PC and Xbox.
Tell Me Why, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the picturesque Alaskan town of Delos Crossing - a task that ultimately forces them to confront their traumatic past.
What follows is a deft blend of supernatural mystery thriller and earnest, character-driven homecoming drama - there&#x27;s real beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists - that&#x27;s arguably Dontnod&#x27;s most assured, consistently enjoyable outing yet, even if its perhaps not quite as devastatingly memorable as its Life is Strange forebears.

Alba shares a similar focus on good deeds and community spirit as UsTwo&#x27;s antique restoration game Assemble with Care, but fashions a much more open-ended adventure around that feel-good core, casting players as young girl Alba as she whiles away the summer on the sprawling Mediterranean island of Pinar del Mar, her best friend Ines in tow.
&quot;However, when Alba finds out about plans to build a garish hotel on the site of the island&#x27;s nature reserve,&quot; explains UsTwo, &quot;she sets out to stop it!&quot;

                    <span>Far Cry 6 narrative director Navid Khavari has issued a lengthy statement on the politics of the game, following a backlash to a quote of his last week.
In a post on the Ubisoft blog, Khavari sought to reassure fans that Far Cry 6 would include &quot;hard, relevant discussions&quot; about &quot;the rise of fascism in a nation, the costs of imperialism, forced labour, the need for free-and-fair elections, LGBTQ+ rights, and more within the context of Yara&quot;, the game&#x27;s fictional Caribbean island setting.
&quot;Our story is political,&quot; Khavari commented. &quot;A story about a modern revolution must be.&quot;

                    <span>The COVID-19 relief Humble Bundle has raised $1,170,824 (£825,000).
Humble launched the Heal COVID-19 Bundle a couple of weeks back to support a number of charities aiding the hardest-hit countries such as Brazil and India, as well as the global medical effort to save lives. It&#x27;s gone on to sell 54,374 bundles and raise aid for the humanitarian efforts of Direct Relief, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), International Medical Corps, and GiveIndia.
&quot;Direct Relief is tremendously grateful to Humble Bundle and its community of passionate and generous people,&quot; Direct Relief said in a statement on the official website (thanks, The Gamer). &quot;Their collective efforts will translate to critically-needed medicines, supplies, and other resources to the hardest-hit communities in India and Brazil as they continue to battle rising cases of COVID-19.

                    <span>A cancelled Fallout 2 sequel by Black Isle studios is now available to play in Fallout New Vegas courtesy of a new PC mod.
The game - which at the time had been codenamed Van Buren - takes place in 2253 and had been set in the great Midwest Commonwealth over four states. Sadly, it was cancelled in 2003, and while New Vegas inherited some aspects from the game, the Revelation Blue mod doesn&#x27;t &quot;treat [Fallout: New Vegas] as cannon [sic] in any way&quot;.
&quot;The project&#x27;s goal is to remake Van Buren for Fallout New Vegas,&quot; explains the mod creator (thanks, PC Gamer).

In an update on the Destruction AllStars subreddit, developer Lucid outlined features due out for the action driving game. Chief among them is the addition of online bots.
Lucid acknowledged that the size of Destruction AllStars&#x27; community, spread out as it is across the world, means the game has peak times and low times of player activity for online matchmaking. The peaks tend to be around 5pm to 11pm UK time during weekdays, and 3pm to 2am UK time on the weekend.

This week the British developer announced it had wrapped up work on Total War: Three Kingdoms with the 1.7.1 patch. No more DLC or patches will be released for the game, which broke series records upon launch in May 2019.
Total War: Three Kingdoms saw seven DLC releases over the course of two years, but many fans feel Creative Assembly quit the game too early - and before the release of a promised expansion that would build out the north of the map.

                    <span>A new Microsoft Flight Simulator patch has reduced the game&#x27;s initial full download from over 170GB to 83GB.
In the patch notes for Sim Update 4, aka patch 1.16.20.0, the development team said it had performed optimisations for the initial full download of Microsoft Flight Simulator so the base game is 83GB instead of over 170GB.
It&#x27;s good news to see the game&#x27;s download halved, although 83GB is still a chunky old effort.

                    <span>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the acclaimed 2019 Castlevania spiritual successor from Koji Igarashi and developer ArtPlay, is getting a sequel.
That&#x27;s according to a single, and only mildly informative, slide found within publisher 505 Games&#x27; latest fiscal year financial results presentation (as spotted by Gematsu) - which, as well as noting that Bloodstained has now sold more than 1m copies, amassing over €30m in sales, confirms a &quot;second version&quot; is currently in development.
As Gematsu points out, &quot;second version&quot;, although a somewhat unusual turn of phrase in this context, appears throughout the presentation in conjunction with other properties that have confirmed sequels, such as One More Level&#x27;s action-parkour game Ghostrunner.

                    <span>UK chain GAME has launched an eye-catching offer to get Xbox Series S for less than £100 when you trade-in a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
But, tellingly, GAME&#x27;s terms and conditions for this offer make it clear that this is only open to the public - and not to &quot;trade&quot; resellers looking for a quick profit.
&quot;GAME reserves the right to refuse any offer to anyone believed to be representing a trade buyer/customer,&quot; the chain states. In other words, if you manage a CEX, no telling your staff to go upgrade dozens of knackered Xbox Ones for Series S to just resell the newer consoles for profit. This may well apply if you&#x27;re an organised scalper, too.

                    <span>It&#x27;s hardly the biggest discount of all time - Among Us is currently £3.99 on Steam and completely free on iOS and Android - but if you&#x27;ve been thinking about dipping a toe into Among Us on PC, you can now do so for free via the Epic Games Store. 
The social deduction game, which originally released in 2018 but became enormously popular during the lockdowns of 2020, is free as part of Epic&#x27;s ongoing Mega Sale (which lasts until 17th June). Those who have an Epic Games Store account can grab Among Us for free until 3rd June.
Once you&#x27;ve claimed the free game, you&#x27;ll have access to new map The Airship, and be able to play with friends on other platforms like Switch, Android and iOS. The game is due to arrive on PlayStation later this year, too, so hopefully there won&#x27;t be any problems with cross-play there.

                    <span>Company of Heroes 2 and Ardennes Assault are free to download and keep forever on Steam this weekend.
Relic&#x27;s superb World War 2 real-time strategy game and its standalone single-player campaign are free to download and keep via Steam now until 3rd June 2021.
2013&#x27;s Company of Heroes 2 is widely regarded as one of the best RTS games around. &quot;While Company of Heroes 2 sometimes makes you feel like you&#x27;re fighting the game as well as the enemy, if you take time to understand the systems at work beneath the carnage and pick and choose your battles wisely, you will ultimately be rewarded by a deep and enjoyable RTS,&quot; wrote Stace Harman in Eurogamer&#x27;s Company of Heroes 2 review.

                    <span>Merle Dandridge will reprise her role as Marlene in the TV show based on Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us. The Hollywood Reporter revealed the casting.
Marlene is the boss of the Fireflies, the resistance movement who fights for freedom against the military. She appeared in both The Last of Us games.
Dandridge joins Pedro Pascal (Joel) and Bella Ramsey (Ellie) on the cast of HBO&#x27;s upcoming show. Gabriel Luna plays Tommy, Joel&#x27;s younger brother. As already announced, Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann are writing the script for the series.

                    <span>Cyberpunk 2077 has a new game director - and it&#x27;s former creative director Gabriel Amatangelo. 
Amatangelo joined CD Projekt back in January 2020, and will now take over from former game director Adam Badowski. According to a report by GamesIndustry.biz, Badowski will now focus on other leadership duties within CD Projekt, including the company&#x27;s new &quot;strategic development framework&quot; that will see the Cyberpunk and Witcher brands developed in parallel. 
Before becoming a creative director for Cyberpunk 2077, Amatangelo also worked as a design director on Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC, and lead designer on several expansions for Star Wars: The Old Republic. Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s roadmap indicates that we should see several free DLCs for the game over the next year, and Amatangelo certainly has some experience in this area.

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s latest crossover is something nobody expected - well, except perhaps the author of the Mistborn book series, Brandon Sanderson. 
Mistborn character Kelsier became a Fortnite character last night, available via the Item Shop complete with in-game artwork and accessories. 
Fortnite has crossed over with dozens of comics, popstars, film and TV characters in the past. Kelsier, however, is the game&#x27;s first novel tie-in.

                    <span>During Sonic&#x27;s 30th anniversary livestream, Sega teased a new Sonic game from Sonic Team due out at some point in 2022.
Without naming the game, Sega revealed this new Sonic game is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. The brisk accompanying trailer didn&#x27;t show anything beyond the hedgehog running through a forest, and a mysterious symbol:
Sonic fans soon poked around the trailer&#x27;s innards on the hunt for clues. Thankfully, Sega itself stepped in with a press release that names the game.

                    <span>Just as it promised, Sony has pulled back the veil on Guerrilla Games&#x27; highly anticipated Horizon Forbidden West, sharing 14 minutes of gorgeous gameplay running on PlayStation 5.
As you can see in the video below, it&#x27;s an immediate feast for the eyes, beginning as Aloy scrambles through dense jungle foliage before stumbling out onto a oceanside settlement, all sandy beaches, deep blue water, and vast rock spires on the horizon, shrouded in clouds. These, Guerrilla later confirms, are the remnants of San Francisco, millennia into the future, and it&#x27;s here that Aloy encounters machine-riding raiders, immediately embarking on some nimble combat, firing arrows and hurtling acrobatically around the environment to escape their attack.
This initial sequence ends beneath the waves as Aloy swims through gorgeous coral reefs, kelp, and exotic fauna, fighting the current as she goes. Eventually she reaches dry land and encounters the raiders once more, this time choosing to take a more stealthy approach as she attempts to liberate her kidnapped friend.

                    <span>Techland&#x27;s parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2, has - after a rather tumultuous few years of development - finally received a release date. It&#x27;ll be coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 7th December, and Techland has released a brand-new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.
Dying Light 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first game, in a world devastated by a mutated version of the original virus. With over 98% of the population now lost, the remnants of humanity have congregated in the sprawling metropolis of Villedor, also known as The City, and it&#x27;s here that new protagonist Aiden Caldwell finds himself while searching for his family.
To date, Techland has really only painted the ensuing adventure in broad strokes, talking up key points such as Dying Light 2&#x27;s 2-4 player co-op, its returning day and night cycle, and its focus on choice and consequence. Today&#x27;s developer livestream didn&#x27;t go too much further than those core concepts, but did flesh them out with a few additional details.

                    <span>Sonic&#x27;s 30th anniversary livestream has come and gone, leaving a big blue streak in its wake, and while it wasn&#x27;t perhaps the most revelatory of showings, Sega did at least confirm the previously rumoured Sonic Colors remaster and retro Sonic collection - as well as providing the tiniest teases of Sonic&#x27;s next major game.
Starting with the remaster, it&#x27;s called Sonic Colors Ultimate and will be heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (exclusively via the Epic Games Store) on 7th September this year.
As those who&#x27;ve played the 2010 original will know, Sonic Colors transports the iconic mascot to Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s interstellar theme park for a familiar blend of appropriately high-speed into-the-screen and side-on platforming, with the hedgehog able to access handy new skills, such as a speed boost or the ability to drill underground, thanks to friendly Wisps.

                    <span>Stealthy undead swordsman sequel Aragami 2 launches for Playtation, PC and Xbox on 17th September, developer Lince Works has announced. 
Our first look at polished Aragami 2 gameplay lies in the new trailer below, which shows a new threat for the Rashomon Valley and various ninja-inspired fights.
The original Aragami sold 700k copies and helped grow Lince Works as a studio, the developer said in a release today, meaning Aragami 2 is now the work of a more experienced and larger team. Combat has been overhauled, and looks sneakier than ever. Here&#x27;s a peek:

                    <span>Raven has stepped in to nerf Call of Duty: Warzone&#x27;s &quot;Big Bertha&quot; meta.
Today&#x27;s update reduces the cargo truck spawn rates for the battle royale&#x27;s solo mode to five (static) from a range of 16 to 20.
As Eurogamer reported earlier this month, Call of Duty: Warzone players have been using the 6x6 cargo truck vehicle to great effect in what&#x27;s dubbed the &quot;Big Bertha meta&quot;.

                    <span>Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said PlayStation cross-platform support has been cut from an upcoming Borderlands 3 patch - though without explaining why. 
In a tweet sent this afternoon, Pitchford said that while a Borderlands 3 update had been prepared for release &quot;that includes full crossplay support across all platforms&quot;, PlayStation will ultimately not be included.
Pitchford did not detail why, upon submitting the patch for certification, Gearbox was then forced to remove crossplay by the game&#x27;s publisher 2K. Did Sony suddenly decide to take issue with the game&#x27;s long-promised crossplay becoming a reality? Or did Gearbox and/or 2K decide not to play by Sony&#x27;s rules? Pitchford has so far chosen not to elaborate.

                    <span>Creative Assembly has wrapped up work on Total War: Three Kingdoms.
The 1.7.1 patch, which goes live today, marks the end of the British studio&#x27;s post-launch support for the popular strategy game, which saw seven DLC releases over the course of two years.
The development team has transitioned onto another project based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel, Creative Assembly said in a video to fans, below.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot more to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation investor relations document than confirmation Uncharted 4 is coming to PC.
The document, published as part of Sony&#x27;s 2021 investor relations day, focuses on the company&#x27;s Game &amp; Network Services Segment. It&#x27;s penned by PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, and includes a number of interesting bits of information that reveal Sony&#x27;s masterplan for its money-printing video games business.
At the beginning, Sony mentions it&#x27;s &quot;building our biggest-ever platform&quot; with PlayStation 5, and that it&#x27;s working to ensure &quot;our longest-ever tail&quot; with the PS4. PS5 has delivered PlayStation&#x27;s highest-ever launch sales, with 7.8m units sold as of the end of Sony&#x27;s last financial year (ending March 2021).

This year, tickets for the two-day affair cost just £5 (or $5), a third of 2020&#x27;s fee. Once again, there will be no physical event, and all players will be able to take part wherever they are. 
There will also be plenty to do for people who don&#x27;t purchase a ticket.

The video, currently available to watch on the Battlefield subreddit (with an epilepsy warning), confirms a near future setting for the upcoming DICE-developed game.
We also hear soldiers shout, a rocket attempt to launch into space before collapsing onto the ground, and, at the end, a reveal of the title &quot;Battlefield&quot;.

But - and this won&#x27;t come as a surprise to anyone - FIFA Ultimate Team made the bulk of that money. Or, as EA recently put it in a regulatory financial document, &quot;a substantial portion&quot;.

In a document published as part of Sony&#x27;s Investor Relations day, Sony mentions Uncharted 4 under &quot;more PC releases planned&quot; (it&#x27;s on page 26).
Sony is putting more of its PlayStation 4 games on PC. It&#x27;s already released Guerrilla&#x27;s Horizon: Zero Dawn on PC and, most recently, Sony Bend&#x27;s Days Gone. It makes sense that Naughty Dog&#x27;s five-year-old adventure game would be part of Sony&#x27;s PC push.

I understand this is to ensure third-parties working on games which support the upgraded Switch are free to announce these projects at E3, and before Nintendo&#x27;s own digital showcase later in that week. 
(Nintendo&#x27;s event has yet to be formally dated but is currently set to slot in after other publishers towards the end of E3, though of course dates can still shift.)

                    <span>Dragon Quest celebrated its 35th anniversary in some style in the early hours of this morning, with a livestream from Japan heralding the announcement of a string of new entries and spin-offs for the much-loved RPG series.
Heading the lot was Dragon Quest 12, which will be the first mainline entry since 2017. Not much was shown beyond a brief trailer revealing a logo - though that logo did reveal a turn towards dark fantasy, and what series&#x27; creator dubbed a Dragon Quest &#x27;for adults&#x27;. It&#x27;s being primed for a simultaneous worldwide release - in what would be a first for a mainline entry - though the timing has yet to be revealed, while no platforms have been announced just yet. 
Elsewhere, a remake of Dragon Quest 3 was announced, taking on the 2D/3D stylings of the likes of Octopath Traveler - and being ushered into existence by Octopath Traveler producer Masaaki Hayasaka. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D, as it&#x27;s somewhat clumsily called at present, again has no release date or confirmed platforms, though it is also slated for a worldwide simultaneous release and we were afforded a look at it in action.

                    <span>We&#x27;re a little over two weeks away from this year&#x27;s attempt at an online-only E3, meaning everyone&#x27;ll soon be sinking into the familiar swamp of showcase schedules and diary dates required to keep track of the event and everything around it. Wisely starting early to avoid the ensuing scramble, though, Microsoft has announced a 13th June air date for this year&#x27;s E3-adjacent Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.
It&#x27;ll be a significant event for a number of reasons, not least because it&#x27;s the first joint announcement show for the two companies following Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Bethesda last year, and things kick off at 10am PT on Sunday, 13th June - which, for us UK folk, equates to an entirely tolerable 6pm in the afternoon. It&#x27;s a long one too, with Microsoft promising 90-minutes of announcements - hopefully that&#x27;s a taut 90 minutes with none of the waffly filler it usually loves to pad out its livestreams with (hello Inside Xbox, I&#x27;m looking at you).
As you&#x27;d expect, there&#x27;s little in the way of specific regarding the games we&#x27;ll be seeing - all the better to retain that all-important element of surprise - and Microsoft is merely teasing a look at the &quot;epic gaming lineup coming out of [the Bethesda] partnership, the incredible games coming to Xbox this holiday, upcoming releases on Xbox Game Pass, and more.&quot;

                    <span>Blizzard has officially cancelled its BlizzCon live event for the second year running, citing the &quot;ongoing complexities and uncertainties of the pandemic&quot;.
Last year&#x27;s real-world BlizzCon was cancelled due to coronavirus-related &quot;health and safety considerations&quot;, and its long-awaited digital-only replacement - formally titled BlizzConline - eventually took place in February this year. Since then, it&#x27;s been unclear if Blizzard was still planning to press ahead with a proper large-scale physical gathering in 2021, perhaps around the early November weekend usually reserved for its BlizzCon shows.
In a new post on the BlizzCon website, however, show executive producer Saralyn Smith has now confirmed the 2021 event will not be going ahead.

                    <span>Sonic the Hedgehog voice actor Roger Craig Smith has surprised fans by announcing he&#x27;ll once again be voicing the iconic character, four months after Sega confirmed his departure.
Smith - whose other notable video game roles have included Ezio Auditore da Firenze in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series, Chris Redfield in the Resident Evil series, Batman in Batman: Arkham Oranges, and Mirage in Apex Legends - had voiced Sonic since 2010, even lending his vocal talents to the character in the Wreck-it-Ralph films.
However, back in January, Smith tweeted, &quot;Welp, 10 years was an amazing run. Onward to new zones!&quot;, alongside an image of a broken blue heart. Sega later confirmed what fans had already suspected, announcing Smith&#x27;s departure from the Sonic role.

                    <span>With little fanfare and less than a month until its release, Sega has confirmed Olympic Games Tokyo 2020: The Official Video Game will arrive on 22nd June 2021. 
An officially-licensed compilation of 18 Olympic sport mini-games, it will launch for PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Stadia and Xbox.
Of course, it&#x27;s unsurprising Sega has left this news until so late. While the real-world Olympics are (currently) set to go ahead in July, a year later than originally planned, the debate continues on whether it is right to hold the games at all while many countries - not least its host, Japan - continue to struggle with the impacts of coronavirus.

                    <span>There&#x27;s normally a bit of tuning work to be done when a new legend is introduced to Apex Legends, and jetpack-wielding hero Valkyrie is no exception. Some of her flights are lasting a little longer than Respawn would like, it seems, and the developer has decided to clip her wings. 
As explained by associate live balance designer John Larson, players figured out that hovering with Valkyrie&#x27;s jetpack currently costs very little fuel - and were using this to &quot;take coffee breaks above the final fight in scrims&quot;. It reminds me a bit of when Fortnite players used planes to stay out of battles until the very last moment. 
In any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, Larson said that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this &quot;didn&#x27;t feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings.

                    <span>It&#x27;s hard to keep up with the amount of upcoming sequels and spin-offs for the PUBG universe - there&#x27;s that futuristic new mobile title called PUBG: New State, and space horror game The Callisto Protocol, which looks like a spiritual successor to Dead Space. And now there seems to be a western-themed PUBG game codenamed Project Cowboy on the way. 
South Korean media outlet Bloter spotted job adverts on Krafton&#x27;s website for an &quot;open-world shooting game&quot; that will release on console and PC as an independent title (via Google Translate). Krafton apparently told Bloter that &quot;Project Cowboy is a new IP game for Battleground developed by Krafton&quot;. PUBG dataminer PlayerIGN described it as &quot;PUBG&#x27;s western custom mode&quot; with &quot;old west guns only&quot;.   
Eurogamer contacted Krafton for comment, and was told the company has &quot;nothing to share on Project Cowboy as of now&quot;.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s latest free Title Update arrives tomorrow, 27th May, on Switch, bringing a new story ending, two formidable new opponents in the shape the Crimson Glow Valstrax and Apex Zinogre, new DLC, and more.
Crimson Glow Valstrax, if the name sounds familiar, is a new variant of the Elder Dragon first introduced in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, making its Rise debut with a new form and attacks. The beast is able to change the shape of it wings, notes Capcom, enabling it to fly freely through the sky and survive at unusually high altitudes.
As for the Apex Zinogre, it&#x27;s a tougher version of the familiar Monster Hunter staple already in Rise, and features a striking new look with its golden fur and lightning. Capcom says it&#x27;ll make an appearance in Rampage quests but can be tackled as part of a standard quest too.

                    <span>We knew the upcoming Pokémon games set in the Sinnoh region would arrive sometime later this year, but we now have a set date for Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl: 19th November 2021. 
The new games for Switch were announced back in February, and are essentially retro-style remakes of the original Diamond and Pearl games. In the overworld characters take on a chibi art style, but there are also full-size Pokémon battles. 
Another Sinnoh game arrives early next year, called Pokémon Legends Arceus, which sees players explore a more feudal version of the region with old school pokéballs - and you&#x27;ll be tasked with creating the first ever Pokédex.

As Tom reported when it was announced, Pokémon Legends Arceus is an open-world Sinnoh game set in a more feudal version of the region.
Old school Pokéballs and a mix of previous starter Pokémon feature, though how Pokémon Legends Arceus connects with the Pokémon God is under wraps. You&#x27;ll be creating the first ever Pokédex.

                    <span>That&#x27;s right, PUBG is getting another batch of fresh maps this year, as the dev team has unveiled its 2021 dev plan - and it includes two brand new locations along with a remaster for Miramar.
The first of these changes is the upcoming Miramar remaster, which is being rolled out in patch 12.1 (now live on PC test servers). Miramar has been tweaked and revamped before, but this time it&#x27;s getting a &quot;much larger remastering&quot;, using the technology used to improve other maps like Sanhok to tweak the &quot;lighting, performance, graphical fidelity, topography, and of course special features&quot;. 
Players can also expect to find &quot;overhauls to terrain and building textures and layouts, easier traversal with the removal of unnecessary obstacles, and even updated cliffs to better fit in the more vertical experience the game has become&quot;. PUBG Corp provided a helpful before and after so you can see exactly what the improvements will look like:

Konami said it had signed a long-term deal with Atalanta, who finished the season in third place, and it starts with PES 2022. The announcement trailer is below:
Konami is going hard on Serie A, and has signed similar deals for Roma, Napoli, and most significant of all, Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s Juventus, which forced rival EA Sports to come up with a fake name for the Old Lady in FIFA 20.

                    <span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has today received a small patch which fixes a couple of minor issues. It&#x27;s the first update for the game since January 2019.
Today&#x27;s patch makes two tiny changes to fix tournament points and match history from being reset. But it has also, again, sparked discussion among players wondering if a more significant update will ever follow.
Released back in 2017, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is Nintendo Switch&#x27;s best-selling game. Four years on, it continues to sell extremely well and has a near-permanent spot in the UK boxed game chart top 10.

                    <span>Valve is reportedly readying to enter the hardware market once more, this time with a new &quot;Switch-like&quot; handheld gaming PC that could potentially launch by the end of the year.
That&#x27;s according to a report by Ars Technica, which expands on the recent discovery of a new hardware-related code - referring to a mysterious device known as &quot;SteamPal&quot; - in the latest version of Steam. Citing &quot;multiple sources familiar with the matter&quot;, Ars Technica claims this device (whose final name remains unconfirmed) is a new Valve-developed all-in-one portable gaming PC that features gamepad controls and a touchscreen in a similar form factor to Nintendo&#x27;s Switch, albeit without detachable controllers.
SteamPal, or whatever it ends up being called (obviously, not calling it the Gabe Boy would be a serious missed opportunity), is reportedly designed to run a large number of games on the Steam PC platform via Linux, and can &quot;dock&quot; to a monitor via its USB Type-C port.

                    <span>The Magnificent Trufflepigs, a romantic first-person metal-detecting adventure from Andrew Crawshaw, lead designer on The Chinese Room&#x27;s Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture, now has a release date and will be making its way to PC next Wednesday, 2nd June.
Trufflepigs is the work of Crawshaw&#x27;s Leeds-based studio Thunkd (which says it wants to become synonymous with &quot;high-quality, short-form, &#x27;evening-sized&#x27; games&quot;), and tells the story of Adam - voiced by Doctor Who and Legends of Tomorrow&#x27;s Arthur Darvill - as he returns to his childhood home in the heart of the English countryside.
What follows is a game of laid-back metal detecting and exploration with a &quot;strong interpersonal narrative&quot; as Adam reunites with old friend Beth (played by Safe House and Another Eden&#x27;s Luci Fish) and joins her on a quest to find a local treasure connected to her past.

                    <span>Axiom Verge 2, the sequel to developer Thomas Happ&#x27;s acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like, is delayed again, and is now expected to launch in the latter half of this year.
Happ had initially planned to launch Axiom Verge 2 on PC and Switch at some point in 2020, but ultimately opted to postpone release into the first half of this year for a variety of reasons. That window was later narrowed to &quot;spring&quot;, but the developer has now announced an additional delay, pushing the game&#x27;s release back to &quot;Q3&quot; 2021 - indicating it&#x27;ll likely arrive between the start of July and the end of September.
&quot;I could go into a long spiel about why it&#x27;s taking longer than I originally forecast,&quot; Happ wrote in a post on his blog, &quot;but I don&#x27;t want to get too bogged down into technical details. Suffice it to say that the game will be better for the additional time, and I won&#x27;t have to burn myself out crunching to hit a date that I set for myself.&quot;

                    <span>Wondering what Sonic&#x27;s been up to lately? Well, it looks like Sega&#x27;s poised to reveal all in a 30th anniversary livestream for the prickly blue icon, scheduled to take place this Thursday.
Sonic Central, as Sega&#x27;s calling its digital showcase, gets underway at 5pm BST/9am PT this Thursday, 27th May, and promises a first look at a number of upcoming &quot;projects, partnerships, and events&quot; the company has been working on as part of its anniversary celebrations.
There&#x27;s no hint as to what those might be as yet, but recent rumours have suggested Sega is prepping both a new collection of classic Sonic titles and a remaster of the hedgehog&#x27;s 2010 outing Sonic Colors. Perhaps we&#x27;ll also finally get a glimpse of Sonic&#x27;s next major new game, which was confirmed to be in production back in 2019.

                    <span>It&#x27;s a busy day for developer Ion Lands; not only is its gorgeous Blade Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk&#x27;s &quot;sequel-sized&quot; paid DLC, City of Ghosts, now available on PC, the studio has announced a new cyberpunk-themed life-sim spin-off too.
City of Angels, which seems as good a place as any to start, offers a brand-new, fully voiced story campaign that serves as a direct sequel to the original game. Main protagonist Rania and canine companion Camus return for another skyhigh HOVA-based jaunt around the neon-drenched metropolis of Nivalis, but this time there&#x27;s a new hero - deadbeat gambler Hayse - with players switching between two interlinking stories as the adventure unfolds.
Ion Worlds says City of Angels is longer than the original story, as well as &quot;darker, tenser, more complex&quot;, and promises new areas to explore, new characters and mysteries, HOVA customisation, street racing, and different endings depending on player choices. It&#x27;s out now on Steam for £12.99/$14.99 USD, and there&#x27;s a 10% launch day discount.

                    <span>Remember bird dating sim Hatoful Boyfriend? It&#x27;s hard to forget, to be honest, but if you haven&#x27;t yet bought it on iOS, Android or the PlayStation Store then your time is limited, as the game is being delisted from these platforms at the end of May. 
Manga artist and Hatoful Boyfriend creator Hato Moa announced the news on her Twitter account earlier this week, explaining that both Hatoful Boyfriend and its seasonal sequel Holiday Star will no longer be purchasable on these platforms as &quot;publishing agreements on those platforms are coming to an end&quot;. Those who already bought the games through these platforms will still be able to use them, however, while the games will remain on sale via Steam. 
If you missed it the first time around, well, Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel about dating birds that was released back in 2014. I guess you can say it&#x27;s been out for aviary long time. You play as the only human student accepted into a school for birds, where you must navigate classes and build relationships with talking birds. It&#x27;s all pretty eccentric, but the game earned itself a cult following and critical acclaim for the quality of its character writing.

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s storyline has kicked back into gear as its primal-themed season draws to a close. Today brings map changes, new challenges, extra-terrestrial warnings, and several hints at what next season may bring.
This morning, Fortnite received update 16.50, the last patch expected before its next season on 7th June. Eagle-eyed fans immediately noticed several changes around the island: a crashed helicopter near the dam, posters showing UFOs and friendly aliens at the beach, and flattened corn at the farm. 
3pm UK time today brought a new set of &quot;Foreshadowing&quot; challenges live, where you&#x27;re asked to investigate that helicopter, as well as a series of smashed telescopes on the island. Does someone not want its inhabitants looking at the skies?

                    <span>A much-requested feature has finally been introduced to Apex Legends&#x27; Arenas mode, as the 3v3 team deathmatches now have a leaving penalty - something that should hopefully deter players from flaking on their squadmates. 
Several changes were announced via patch notes posted on Twitter, including the new abandon penalty for Arenas games. Respawn explained that this is similar to the penalty for Ranked Battle Royale games, and will apply to those who leave a full squad in the middle of a match. 
Unfortunately it seems a couple of people are currently getting unfairly punished by the new penalty, with some reporting being slapped with 10-minute sin bins for leaving during the end screen animations. Director of communications Ryan K. Rigney assured one player that the team was investigating the problem.

                    <span>Focus Home Interactive has released 15 minutes of Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Storm Ground gameplay.
The gameplay, which you can see in the video below, is narrated by game director Jeff Lydell and design director Ian Christy from developer Gasket Games. We see a small group of Stormcast Eternals during a mid-to-late battle of the campaign against a modest Nighthaunt army.
The Stormcast Eternals&#x27; numbers are few, so Lydell makes smart use of his units&#x27; skills as well as knowledge of the environment (pushback, high ground bonuses, lethal hazards etc) to win the assasination mission.

                    <span>After an agonisingly long hiatus Sega&#x27;s much-loved fighting series Virtua Fighter is back, with a remaster of the most recent game coming to PlayStation 4 next month. 
Virtua Fighter: Ultimate Showdown looks to be a remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, the last installment which hit arcades way back in 2010. Final Showdown was itself the last iteration of Virtua Fighter 5, folding in new characters Taka-Arashi and Jean Kujo as well as introducing a more athletic moveset for its cast. We wrote some nice things about it in our Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown review upon its console launch in 2012. 
Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown saw the series bow out at its peak, although it&#x27;s been kept alive in some way via appearances in the arcades of Sega&#x27;s hugely successful Yakuza games. Is this the mark of a grand return for Virtua Fighter? The trailer - exclusively hosted on IGN - suggests perhaps not, declaring that the ultimate 3D fighter is back for the final round, with this remaster coinciding with Sega&#x27;s ongoing 60th anniversary celebrations. Still, there remains hope and it&#x27;s a delight to see the series back in any form.

                    <span>It&#x27;s a trial that began with teens flooding the public phone line, gave us debates over the appropriateness of a naked banana, and asked the eternal question &quot;what is Eurogamer?&quot; Yes, the Epic Games v Apple antitrust trial has now concluded, and after three weeks of remarkable discussions the decision over who won rests with a federal judge.
The trial wrapped up yesterday with some closing remarks from both parties, with Epic reiterating that the case would have an impact on the wider mobile games market and other developers (via GamesIndustry.biz). 
&quot;Epic acknowledges that this is an important case, that there&#x27;s an important set of conduct, and that a remedy... of the sort that Epic has requested would be important and significant,&quot; said Epic&#x27;s counsel Gary Bornstein. &quot;But that is because the issue affects such a large number of consumers, such a large number of developers, and has persisted for such a long period of time.&quot;

                    <span>Two months ago, Pokémon Go added a tier system to its loot box-style eggs, which for the first time gave some visibility to the chances of their contents.
This made sorting which eggs to hatch much easier, as it was now clear which were from specific events, and it was also a welcome first step to indicating the likelihood of getting a specific creature, something fans have been loudly calling out for over the past few years.
Now, with weeks of data to test, a group of more than 50 hardcore players at top fan community The Silph Road has analysed thousands of egg hatches to see how well the tier system matches up to reality - and there are some surprising findings.

                    <span>A movie version of Portal is back on track, Star Trek and Lost director J.J. Abrams has said, nearly a decade after we first heard of its existence.
The project still sounds far-off, and there&#x27;s no word on what has been holding up development - but the wheels now seem to be turning.
&quot;We actually do have a script that&#x27;s being written for the Portal movie now at [Warner Bros.],&quot; Abrams said today (thanks, IGN) &quot;We&#x27;re really excited about the take and the pitch, so it feels like that thing&#x27;s finally on the rails.

                    <span>Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, is coming to PC and Mac via Steam on 20th July, with a Switch release to follow early next year.
If you weren&#x27;t already aware, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club&#x27;s equally excellent underground railway builder Mini Metro, and, despite its shift in focus, takes a similarly minimalist approach to its tactile strategy action.
This time around, your goal is to construct an efficient road network - traffic lights, bridges, motorways, and all - to ensure commuters can travel from their home to their (same-coloured) destination before the timer runs out. New building items are awarded each in-game week so your ceaseless march of urban expansion may continue, and just like in Mini Metro, things can quickly become as fraught as they are soothingly low-key.

                    <span>American Truck Simulator now has official - albeit experimental - multiplayer support, courtesy of developer SCS Software&#x27;s latest open beta build, meaning digital truckers need truck the lonely trucking life no more.
Official multiplayer support, which SCS is calling Convoy for self-explanatory reasons, is available now as part of American Truck Simulator&#x27;s experimental beta update 1.41, and will be making its way to Euro Truck Simulator 2 at a later date.
Once installed, this initial work-in-progress version of Convoy will enable players to set-up and host their own private multiplayer session for up to eight trucking pals. Everyone in a session will see synchronised time, weather, and AI traffic - as well as their trucking buddies&#x27; paint jobs and truck accessories - and can undertake the same contracts from the same companies, all heading to the same destination. In-game communication options, if you need them, include CB radio broadcast, quick replies, and text chat.

                    <span>Amanita Design has given its much-loved point-and-click space adventure Samorost a surprise spruce-up in the form of a free new &#x27;enhanced&#x27; edition release on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.
Samorost, which originally released in 2003, serves up an engaging, if brisk, blend of point-and-click puzzling and toy-like tinkering as players follow the delightfully surreal interplanetary adventures of an adorable space gnome.
Samorost has been free to play via web browser for quite some time, but it&#x27;s now available as a free downloadable game on iOS and Android, as well as on PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io - meaning all three currently released Samorost titles (the latter two being more substantial paid offerings) are now accessible on the aforementioned storefronts for your amusement.

                    <span>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has released a lengthy statement meant to lay out the progress he says his company has made since last summer&#x27;s devastating reports of sexual harassment and toxic working environments within various teams across the business.
The post, published to Ubisoft&#x27;s blog, comes in the wake of a French report in Le Télégramme this month that claimed the company had made only minimal changes. Ubisoft rebutted some of that report at the time, while today&#x27;s statement from the very top of the company doubles down further.
&quot;Last June, we faced the fact that not all team members were experiencing the safe and inclusive workplace that we had always intended Ubisoft to be,&quot; Guillemot writes. &quot;Since then, we have engaged in a company-wide effort to listen, learn and build a roadmap for a better Ubisoft for all.

                    <span>Square Enix is reportedly collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off for PS5 and PC titled Final Fantasy Origins.
Word on the project initially began circulating over the weekend on Reddit and Resetera, and well-connected journalist and former Kinda Funny co-host Imran Khan has now lent further credence to the rumours, citing sources able to corroborate the news in a story on Fanbyte.
Final Fantasy Origins is said to take place &quot;somewhere in or adjacent to the world of the first Final Fantasy game on the NES&quot; and will slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja&#x27;s own Nioh games and From Software&#x27;s Souls series - albeit with a more accessible focus to appeal to a wider audience, according to Khan&#x27;s sources.

The latest Insider Flight update for Halo: The Master Chief Collection came out last week, and with it an email to those in the programme detailing the under-the-radar improvements.
343 mentioned the patch includes &quot;a series of bug fixes to improve the classic visuals in H1 to better mirror the original Xbox version&quot;. This applies to both classic campaign and multiplayer, 343 added.

How it will look and work is yet to be seen, though the ESA has said all partaking developers and publishers can still livestream announcements on YouTube and other streaming platforms as well.

                    <span>One of Street Fighter 2&#x27;s most enduring myths has finally been proven true 30 years after it began.
The myth is that Street Fighter 2: World Warrior, which launched in 1991, contains a 10-0 matchup between Zangief and E. Honda.
The 10-0 matchup phrase is used by some within the fighting game community to describe a fight between two specific characters where one is so dominant that it always wins in a best of 10 match - no matter what the opponent with the weaker character tries to do.

                    <span>A Call of Duty: Warzone developer has suggested they will tone down the sun lens flare in Verdansk &#x27;84 - the game&#x27;s main map.
Some players have complained about the sun glare being so intense in Verdansk &#x27;84 that it causes visibility issues. It&#x27;s particularly problematic when looking outside of a building from the inside, in certain sections of the map.
Responding to an article on Dexerto, Raven Software&#x27;s lead VFX artist Reed Shingledecker tweeted to say: &quot;I can easily tone it down if needed.&quot;

                    <span>This month, the New York state attorney general issued a report on a scheme by “U.S. Companies and Partisans [to] Hack Democracy.” This wasn’t another attempt by Republicans to make it harder for Black people and urban residents to vote. It was a concerted attack on another core element of US democracy ­– the ability of citizens to express their voice to their political representatives. And it was carried out by generating millions of fake comments and fake emails purporting to come from real citizens.
This attack was detected because it was relatively crude. But artificial intelligence technologies are making it possible to generate genuine-seeming comments at scale, drowning out the voices of real citizens in a tidal wave of fake ones...</span>

                    <span>Respawn has opened up about the cost of premium items in Apex Legends&#x27; in-game store. 
In a recent Reddit AMA, players pointed out that the cost of premium skins can cost around 1800 Apex Coins - which is the equivalent to $18 (£13) give or take.
&quot;I get that you gotta make the game profitable, but there&#x27;s gotta be a way to prevent the player from feeling cheated when they buy something,&quot; pointed out Redditor x5hadau.

                    <span>A French retailer has seemingly leaked an &quot;EU version&quot; of Sonic Collection for PlayStation 4.
It&#x27;s the same company that may have outed that Sonic Colors remaster a few weeks back, too.
French site Sogamely boasts no cover art or release date, and right now only lists the game as coming to PS4 &quot;soon&quot;. While that can only put this firmly in the take-with-a-giant-bucket-of-salt category, we do know that Sega is currently busy celebrating 30 years of Sonic, so a game collection is certainly a possibility (thanks, VGC). We&#x27;ve reached out to Sega for comment, though, and will update as/when we hear back.

                    <span>Unhappy Elite Dangerous: Odyssey PC players are hitting developer Frontier where it hurts - Steam reviews.
The new content, Odyssey, released on 19th May, is allegedly causing all kinds of problems, with reports of crashes, poor performance, bugged missions, and poor optimisation according to recent reviews left on the game&#x27;s Steam page.
The feedback now aggregates over 3000 reviews, 2.2K of which are deemed &quot;mostly negative&quot;, despite a second hotfix that rolled out on Friday in a bid to address the game&#x27;s stability (thanks, NME).

                    <span>Twitch is introducing 350+ new community tags that will enable streamers not just to tag the content of the games they&#x27;re playing, but also &quot;who they are and what they [stand] for&quot;, too.
&quot;We had planned to share this next week, but we&#x27;ve heard a lot of you talking and want to make sure the record is clear. Next week we&#x27;ll be adding 350+ new tags to celebrate yourself and your community,&quot; explained a tweet on the official Twitch Twitter account over the weekend.
The new tags - which were drawn up in consultation with &quot;independent, third-party organisations&quot; and &quot;other experts focused on the progress of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, LGBTQIA+, disabled, and marginalized communities&quot; - are &quot;related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, mental health, and more&quot;.

                    <span>Ten years after its original release, it looks like a Crysis 2 remaster is in development.
The official Crysis Twitter account dropped the tease earlier this week with two tweets. The first states &quot;They used to call me Prophet&quot; - which refers to Crysis 2 character Major Laurence &quot;Prophet&quot; Barnesa - and then a follow-up tweet gives away nowt but the wide-eyes emoji.
The following day, it shared a screenshot from Crysis 2 and yet another eyes emoji.

                    <span>Bungie has banned one of the first players to complete the refreshed Vault of Glass raid after their username appeared on the World&#x27;s First Raid Report page.
While Clan Elysium was the world&#x27;s first to complete the new raid in 1hr 43m and 55s, the second team included on the World&#x27;s First page - which finished the raid in 2hr 24m and 16s - has just five names listed.
That&#x27;s because the sixth person, using the gamertag #BlackLivesDontMatter, has subsequently been banned and removed from the list.

                    <span>Well here&#x27;s something I wasn&#x27;t expecting to write on a Friday afternoon (or, indeed, ever). Hello Games&#x27; effervescent space sim No Man&#x27;s Sky is getting in on the big-brand crossover action, and you&#x27;re currently able to unlock a little piece of BioWare&#x27;s Mass Effect to treasure forever in-game in the form of your very own SSV Normandy SR1.
Mass Effect&#x27;s iconic SSV Normandy SR1 appears in No Man&#x27;s Sky as a reward for players that complete the space sim&#x27;s currently ongoing second Expedition.

                    <span>A Red Dead Redemption 2 VR mod has launched in early access form.
It&#x27;s the work of developer Luke Ross, who has form when it comes to VR mods. He built the eye-catching VR mod for Grand Theft Auto 5 our Ian Higton enjoyed last year.
The video below from UploadVR gives us a good idea of how it works in combination with a gamepad. It&#x27;s early days, but it&#x27;s cool to see Rockstar&#x27;s epic in VR. The cutscenes work in VR, too.

                    <span>The Titanfall games seem to be experiencing problems with DDoS attacks - again - and Respawn has announced it&#x27;s investigating the latest wave. 
Over the past few days players have taken to social media to report more DDoS attacks on both Titanfall and Titanfall 2, resulting in both regular players and content creators being booted from servers (or unable to connect at all). This time the attacks seem particularly severe, as Titanfall 2 streamers have said they are being &quot;blacklisted&quot; by the hacker so that t…</span>

                    <span>Raven Software has done a great job in recent weeks with Call of Duty: Warzone patch notes. It&#x27;s detailed changes and explained its thinking behind them. But one change it failed to mention that arrived as part of this week&#x27;s mid-season three update was a lighting makeover for Rebirth Island.
Rebirth Island, the smaller, and dare I say it more fun of the two maps available to play in Activision&#x27;s battle royale, is brighter now, with a soft blue, &#x27;80s-inspired colour palette. It&#x27;s certainly nicer to look at,…</span>

Last year, a long-lost prototype of the Xbox console exclusive running on PS3 came to light, courtesy of self-proclaimed former hacker PixelButts. Eight hours of footage was released showing the build being played, with only a couple of bugs. This footage is still available to view - Epic hasn&#x27;t attempted to take it down:

From 25th to 27th May, Bungie will deploy a unique Vanguard Strikes crossplay beta playlist to test what works and find out what doesn&#x27;t. 
Anyone on PlayStation, Steam, Xbox and even Stadia can take part. Play three Strikes in the playlist and you&#x27;ll get a special emblem for your trouble.

                    <span>Overwatch 2 PvP is 5v5, Blizzard has said.
The developer released a video, below, detailing changes coming to PvP in the upcoming shooter.
Chief among them is the switch from 6v6 to 5v5. In the standard PvP game modes of Overwatch 2, each team contains one tank, two damage and two support characters. This makes for a significant shift, Blizzard said, in terms of map design and the dynamics between roles.

Emsisoft has identified two distinct tactics. In the first, hackers encrypt data with ransomware A and then re-encrypt that data with ransomware B. The other path involves what Emsisoft calls a “side-by-side encryption” attack, in which attacks encrypt some of an organization’s systems with ransomware A and others with ransomware B. In that case, data is only encrypted once, but a victim would need both decryption keys to unlock everything. The researchers also note that in th…</span>

That&#x27;s all we know for now. Injustice is of course a series of DC-flavoured fighting games from Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm. Injustice: Gods Among Us came out in 2013, before a sequel, Injustice 2, came out in May 2017.

                    <span>Nintendo has announced five more retro games for its Switch Online catalogue, bringing the service&#x27;s overall total of NES and SNES classics to 104. 
But while Nintendo noted it had passed the 100 game milestone, Nintendo fans are less impressed with the games on offer. 
May&#x27;s list of additions includes SNES games Caveman Ninja (also known as Joe &amp; Mac), Magical Drop 2, Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 and Spanky&#x27;s Quest, plus Ninja JaJaMaru-kun for NES. Here&#x27;s a look at all of those in action:

                    <span>Watching speedrunners strut their stuff in Summer Games Done Quick always makes for entertaining viewing, and this year&#x27;s event looks like another banger. There&#x27;s GeoGuessr runs, blindfolded Super Mario 64, and even a Destiny 2 Deep Stone Crypt raid. And as usual, it&#x27;s all for a good cause. 
Summer Games Done Quick 2021 is scheduled to take place between 4th-11th July, with a packed-out timetable and a real mix of games. There&#x27;s Dragon Age: Inquisition, Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Nintendogs, Outer Wilds, Dishonored, …</span>

                    <span>Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, the new CGI series from Netflix, has today received a new trailer and an 8th July release date. 
Our best look yet at the Leon S. Kennedy-starring show, this two-minute montage has vomiting zombies, zombie rats and a hulking big thing which may be the series&#x27; big bad. 
Let&#x27;s take a look:

                    <span>Treyarch has added sniper flinch to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War as part of the game&#x27;s latest big update.
Black Ops Cold War Multiplayer fans have called for some form of sniper flinch ever since the game came out last year.
Flinch is the disruption caused to your aim when you&#x27;re hit by enemy fire. Sniper rifles are seen by some as overpowered in Black Ops Cold War because of their distinct lack of flinch.

                    <span>Nintendo has revealed a Zelda and Loftwing amiibo figurine which launches alongside its Skyward Sword HD remaster on 16th July.
Tapping the amiibo to your Switch lets you zip between the game&#x27;s airborne overworld and Hyrule&#x27;s surface, wherever you are - a handy feature not available in the original game. See this in action in the trailer below:
The fact Nintendo has added this ability will undoubtedly save time when playing Skyward Sword HD. You no longer have to visit specific points to swap between the sk…</span>

As well as Rambo and John McClane as brand new operators, and the baseball bat melee weapon and AMP63 pistol, Treyarch&#x27;s shooter gets two new Multiplayer maps, the new main quest for Zombies&#x27; Outbreak mode, and Rambo and Die Hard twists on classic game modes.

From 20th May, Nakatomi Plaza from Die Hard will appear in Downtown for a limited time. This is the tallest single structure seen in Warzone, and includes five floors of space Die Hard fans will find familiar.

                    <span>Activision has released a new trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone that shows off Rambo in action.
The video, below, reveals how Rambo looks in Activision&#x27;s mega-shooter. We see the &#x27;80s action hero leap out of a chopper at the start of a Warzone game, parachute into the action, and use his iconic bow and arrow. There&#x27;s a lot of shouting while firing guns, as you&#x27;d expect.
There&#x27;s a lot relating to Die Hard here, too. There&#x27;s a brief shot of what looks like Nakatomi Plaza in Warzone:

                    <span>Divinity: Original Sin 2 has been released on iPad and iPad Pro.
This is apparently a proper, full fat port. There are no surprise new microtransactions or anything like that. It&#x27;s the full game, Gift Bag DLCs included, as you remember it on PC or consoles. And it costs £23.99 (check regional pricing).
It&#x27;s been developed over two years by Larian and Russian partner Elveris. DOS2 iPad has touch controls, obviously, but also supports mouse and keyboard as well as game pads, such as the PS5 pad.

SnowRunner arrives for all Xbox Game Pass platforms today - coincidentally the day it confirmed a £20.99 Year 2 Pass for even more post-launch content.
PopCap puzzler Peggle 2 and third-person shooter Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighborville meanwhile both arrive on Thursday, 20th May for cloud devices via EA Play.

                    <span>A teen footballer who was murdered in 2006 is now in FIFA 21.
Kiyan Prince was a 15-year-old playing for Queens Park Rangers when his life was tragically cut short in 2006 when he was stabbed while trying to break up a fight in school.
Now, 15 years later, EA has added Prince to the QPR squad in FIFA 21. He appears in the game as a 30-year-old.

The two companies have been warring over the name for years, though this latest legal challenge from Epic appears to have been sparked by an Nreal boast it had &quot;big news&quot; - seemingly, that its Nreal smartglasses were being prepped for US …</span>

Speed Golf is a fresh mode where players race each other on foot across the golf course in-between taking shots. (If only karts existed in Mario&#x27;s world!)
While dashing, players can use items to regain stamina and special attacks to thwack the ball/other players out of the way. (Seriously, why isn&#x27;t Mario Golf Kart a thing?)

Some of the most-visited POIs with accompanying audio tours include a raft of UK landmarks, such as The O2, Tower Bridge, Hyde Park, The Shard and Big Ben.

                    <span>Its current peak concurrent total of 59,650 (via Steam Charts and BenjiSales) is the highest for any Mass Effect or indeed BioWare game on Steam. 
The average user review rating is &quot;Very Positive&quot;, though there are a number of complaints over the game&#x27;s lack of an FOV slider outside of photo mode, and its insistence on launching Origin to launch the Legendary Edition launcher, to then launch a specific game.

When this problem is discussed, people regularly quote the statistic that 85% of US critical infrastructure is in private hands. It’s a handy number, and matches our intuition. Still, I have never been able to find a factual basis, or anyone who knows where the number comes from. Paul…</span>

                    <span>Knockout City, the EA-published competitive &quot;dodgebrawl&quot; game from Velan Studios, will have a 10-day free trial on all platforms when it launches next Friday, 21st May.
The gist of Knockout City is that, in time-honoured dodgeball style, two teams of players (either 3v3 or 4v4) battle it out for supremacy by lobbing balls at each other. It&#x27;s an easy to understand premise with a vibrantly approachable visual sheen, putting it on a collision course with  countless other offerings in the busy field of live-ser…</span>

                    <span>Another day, another game-breaking glitch in Call of Duty: Warzone. It wasn&#x27;t quite the infamous stim glitch, but the end result was similar, as this time players found an exploit that allowed them to create unbreakable gas masks. Thankfully, this particular method has now been patched out by Raven. 
In your average game of Warzone, masks are supposed to degrade when you sit outside the ring, eventually breaking so that you start taking damage from the gas (and die). Some players figured out a way to glitch…</span>

                    <span>Artwork revealing dozens of potential Fortnite characters has been posted online. 
Fortnite fans do not typically get to see the battle royale&#x27;s eye-catching characters until they&#x27;re added to the game&#x27;s files - and even then, some are encrypted so they&#x27;re a complete surprise until they go on sale. 
However, a new player survey has spilled onto the internet via LeakySussed - and among questions about the game itself there are dozens of unrevealed characters for fans to offer feedback on.

                    <span>Destiny 2&#x27;s new transmog system to change the appearance of items has come under further fire from fans, following its general release. 
In the run up to its long-awaited launch, players despaired at the announcement of its grind-heavy mechanics. Now it&#x27;s actually out in the wild, the criticism has continued. 
Chief among the complaints is the fact that Synthstrand, the base tier of three transmog currencies, appears to be time-gated.

                    <span>Blizzard has lowered the price of a cloned World of Warcraft Classic character following a backlash from players.
The company was set to charge $35 per character for an optional cloning service, which would let players keep playing the original World of Warcraft Classic content and The Burning Crusade content with the same character.
The $35 (around £25) price was roundly criticised by the World of Warcraft community as being too expensive - and Blizzard came under fire accordingly.

The cards will be pulled from all stores on 14th May, but will continue to be sold online.

                    <span>Well, it sure sounds like PlayStation Studios has been beavering away creating first-party games for the PlayStation 5, as an interview has revealed Sony currently has 25 PS5 titles in the works - half of which are new IP.

The animated background, named &quot;The Original&quot;, is more akin to the loading animation you got when first turning on that chunky console rather than its actual dashboard, but the look will likely still feel familiar.

                    <span>Bungie has acknowledged the fact you can currently play with people from platforms other than your own in Destiny 2 - all a little earlier than planned. 
Reports of Destiny 2 crossplay being possible emerged last night, and were picked up by Destiny community manager Cozmo. 
Describing it as an unintended &quot;sneak peek&quot;, Bungie said that crossplay was officially still in development, and would be disabled again in the coming days.

                    <span>Apex Legends&#x27; Legacy update has now been live for over a week - after a somewhat wobbly start - and Respawn has already rolled out some balance changes for two weapons. The Spitfire and newly-added Bocek Bow, both considered overpowered by the player community, have been adjusted to make them a little less lethal. 
As explained on the Legacy patch notes page, the Spitfire&#x27;s bullet damage has been reduced from 19 to 18, while gold and purple magazines will now hold 50 bullets instead of 55. The Bocek seems t…</span>

                    <span>EA has discussed how Battlefield 6 will benefit from its development focus having been on current-gen consoles - PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S - even though it will also launch on last-gen hardware - PS4 and Xbox One.
The fact Battlefield 6 will not be exclusive to current-gen consoles seems somewhat obvious, in the grand scheme of things - with scalpers and low stock still prevalent and a huge, active install base for PS4 and Xbox One. But EA only made it official for the first time last night, in an e…</span>

                    <span>If you attend an AWS talk about security, bump into an AWS security person in a business meeting, or are in line behind an AWS employee at a Starbucks, you’ll invariably hear the phrase “Security is Job Zero.” What does this actually mean? Cynically, I might suggest that they came up with a list of […]

Zombies Ate My Neighbors, which originally launched on SNES and Sega Mega Drive back in 1993, follows the adventures of Zeke and Julie (who can be played solo or co-operatively) as they attempt to save their neighbours from a host of B-movie monsters - zombies, werewolves, vampires, giant ants, aliens, and so on - on a journey that stretches from suburb…</span>

As its name implies, HTC&#x27;s Vive Pro 2 is the direct successor to the high-end PC VR headset it released in 2018. It&#x27;ll up the ante with a 5K resolution display (2448x2448 pixels per eye), a 120-degree field of view, and a 120Hz panel. By way of contrast, the original Vive Pro featured a 2880x1600 resolution, a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate.

EA has not been a major part of E3 for years, instead opting to hold its own EA Play events elsewhere. E3 is traditionally held at the Los Angeles Convention Centre, while in recent years EA has housed its own show at the same time a few miles away up in Hollywood.

                    <span>Activision has offered a glimpse at Rambo in Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops Cold War.
The official Call of Duty Twitter account released a short clip showing Rambo preparing to unleash a fire arrow from his trademark bow at an unfortunate victim, alongside the tagline: &quot;Become war.&quot;
Rambo arrives on 20th May as part of the mid-season update for Season 3 - no doubt as a costly soldier skin.

                    <span>A movie director has accused Capcom of copying one of his monsters for a Resident Evil Village boss fight.
Dutch director Richard Raaphorst said the Sturm boss found in the recently-released Resident Evil Village is a &quot;one-to-one&quot; copy of a monster he created for his 2013 found footage horror film Frankenstein&#x27;s Army.
Capcom failed to comment by press time.

ValheimRAFT is a mod by Sarcen that allows players to construct their own ships rather than simply use the pre-made ones available in vanilla Valheim. (If the name didn&#x27;t give it away, it&#x27;s inspired by the game Raft, a survival game in which you construct a boat from bits of debris.)

                    <span>The constrained supply of the PlayStation 5 will continue into 2022, Sony has warned.
The company&#x27;s CFO, Hiroki Totoki, said Sony will struggle to meet demand even with a supply boost, Bloomberg reported (paywall).
As most know, the PS5 is incredibly hard to buy at the moment, with stock snapped up as soon as it goes on sale. The console has also been the focus of scalpers, who sell on for an inflated price. Retailers have struggled to prevent new consoles from getting into the hands of scalper groups, some…</span>

                    <span>This is a major story: a probably Russian cybercrime group called DarkSide shut down the Colonial Pipeline in a ransomware attack. The pipeline supplies much of the East Coast. This is the new and improved ransomware attack: the hackers stole nearly 100 gig of data, and are threatening to publish it. The White House has declared a state of emergency and has created a task force to deal with the problem, but it’s unclear what they can do.

According to AreaJugones - a Spanish-language site that has previously correctly leaked a PlayStation Plus freebie lineup ahead of confirmation from PlayStation - the new colour schemes deviate from the current white and black scheme to include shades of red and grey.

As spotted and shared by Twitterer LilakeyLK, it looks as though the latest season has not only introduced a new Legend and competitive mode Arenas, but it&#x27;s also made a tweak to one of Wattson&#x27;s key defences... with an emphasis on &quot;fence&quot;.
Previously, running into Wattson&#x27;s fence would slow down an opposing player, but now it looks as though the slowdown and corresponding stun has been removed, essentially making the fence useless (t…</span>

Activision even created a website for a fictional air conditioning repair company called Nakatomi Duct Cleaning, offering its services in Verdansk.
The website says &quot;A NAKATOMI CORP DIVISION MASTERING A/C DUCT CLEANING SINCE 1988&quot;, but the current Warzone map is set in 1984. Nah... I&#x27;m applying too much logic…</span>

Local press reported the strange image on Monday, 3rd May after it popped up overnight - and seemingly had no idea what it was about or who made it.
Its true nature was revealed when Resident Evil Village came out on Friday - it was a Capcom PR stunt. And a pretty cool one, I&#x27;ll admit.

                    <span>A modder has released their final Nier: Automata HD texture pack after four years of development.
GPUnity&#x27;s texture pack mod began life soon after Nier: Automata launched on PC in March 2017. They&#x27;ve continued to work on the mod since then, and now, four years later, released the final version.
Nier: Automata&#x27;s PC version is infamous for a raft of technical issues that were fixed by modders, including a constant stutter tick due to the game running at around 59 frames per second (this is something explored …</span>

                    <span>This week, Sega announced Lost Judgment for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One - but there was no word of a PC version.
It seemed an odd omission - Tojo Dojo noticed the Yakuza spin-off sequel was briefly listed as coming to PC on the official countdown website that was home to the Lost Judgment announcement. Even after mention of PC was removed from the website, fans spotted mention of the Steam logo in the Lost Judgment website source code.
Unfortunately, it appears Lost Judgm…</span>

                    <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&#x27;s re-release on Nintendo Switch was delayed at the last minute.
The re-release of the much-loved 20 year-old action RPG went ahead as planned yesterday on Xbox One, where it costs a pricey £29.99, and PlayStation 4, where for some reason it costs a fiver cheaper at £24.99.
But even though the official Black Isle Studios Twitter page said yesterday that the Switch version would arrive in a couple of hours, the game failed to materialise on the Nintendo eShop.

                    <span>With Titanfall 2 enjoying an Apex Legends-powered resurgence, so is its superb Gauntlet.
Respawn&#x27;s wall-hopping assault course tasks players with completing one lap as quickly as possible - and nearly five years after Titanfall 2 came out, speedrunners are breaking world records again.
In October 2019, speedrunner Cash Mayo set an incredible time of 11.7 seconds, shaving a fraction off Mayo&#x27;s previous world record of 11.9 seconds:

&quot;The Yakuza series has been transformed into a turn-based RPG. On the other hand, over the years, Ryu ga Gotoku Studio has accumulated resources and know-how of making flashy and exhilarating action games that are effortless to enjoy. We decided that we should let our signature action gameplay live on through Lost Judgment.&quot;

It saw 101,726 peak concurrents on launch day, 7th May.
That makes Capcom&#x27;s latest comfortably the biggest PC launch for any Resident Evil game. According to SteamCharts, Resident Evil 7 managed an all-time peak of 18,211 concurrents, Resident Evil 6 peaked with 11,836, and the most recent release, the Resident Evil 3 remake, hit 32,635. Only the Resident Evil 2 remake, which saw a concurrents peak of 74,024, comes close.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone developer Raven has said it is close to a &quot;balance homeostasis&quot;, where most weapon options are &quot;at the very least viable&quot; - leaving it to focus on raising the skill ceiling of the game.
The developer shared its balance change philosophy as part of the patch notes for a Warzone update that went live this week.
Raven spoke openly about the difficulty it faces making sweeping changes to the Warzone meta, as popular guns are inevitably affected.

Umbrella, the second DLC character to arrive as part of Skullgirls 2nd Encore&#x27;s season pass (following on from March&#x27;s Annie), is described as a small, slow character with limited movement that&#x27;s able to take some &quot;big swings&quot; thanks Hungern.

One local told the Chunichi Shimbun newspaper that while the statue may be effective in the long run, the money could have been used for “urgent support,” such as for medical staff and long-term care facilities.
