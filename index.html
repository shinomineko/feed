                              <span>University sim Two Point Campus has clocked up one million players in just a fortnight. 

Publisher Sega said its &quot;bags of charm and tongue-in-cheek comedy&quot; means the hit management sim has &quot;surpassed the milestone even faster than its much-loved predecessor, Two Point Hospital&quot;.

&quot;Two Point Campus was such a thrill to create so we’re ecstatic to see so many people enjoying the game as much as they do!&quot; said studio director, Mark Webley. &quot;We had high hopes that we had created something that fans would love, but the response has exceeded all expectations! We’d like to send a massive thank you to all of the players out there who are showing support by building their wild and wonderful campuses – we can’t wait to see what more you’ll create.&quot;

                              <span>In the run up to New Tales from the Borderlands&#x27; release on 21st October, developer Gearbox has shared 18 minutes of new gameplay footage, offering the best look yet at this long-awaited follow-up to Telltale Games&#x27; acclaimed original.


New Tales from the Borderlands follows the same choice-driven &quot;interactive fiction&quot; template as its predecessor - indeed, Gearbox has hired &quot;key alumni&quot; of the original Telltale Games narrative team for the project - but features three new protagonists in an all-new adventure. 


This time around, all eyes are on Fran Miscowicz - out for revenge after a Maliwan laser hits her frogurt shop - altruistic scientist Anuradha Dahr, and her ambitious &quot;streetwise&quot; brother Octavio Wallace-Dahr, who&#x27;s looking to make his own mark on the metropolis of Promethea.

                              <span>As governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of publisher Activision Blizzard grows - particularly in relation to its impact on PlayStation - Microsoft has revealed a commitment to keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms for &quot;at least several more years&quot; beyond Sony&#x27;s existing marketing contract.


That&#x27;s according to The Verge, which says the commitment was made in a letter from Xbox boss Phil Spencer to PlayStation head Jim Ryan earlier this year.


&quot;In January,&quot; Spencer told the publication in a statement, &quot;we provided a signed agreement to Sony to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation, with feature and content parity, for at least several more years beyond the current Sony contract, an offer that goes well beyond typical gaming industry agreements&quot;.

                              <span>Developer 1047 Games has announced it will be &quot;ending feature development&quot; on its acclaimed free-to-play sci-fi shooter Splitgate in order to shift its focus to creating a new game in the same universe.


Splitgate - which has been described as &quot;Halo meets Portal&quot; in some quarters - made quite the splash last year. Despite having been around on PC since May 2019, an open crossplay beta for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC proved so popular that 1047 Games elected to delay the game&#x27;s multi-platform early access launch in order to better accommodate its unexpected surge in popularity.


1047 Games has continued to build on that success in the months since, most recently launching Splitgate&#x27;s beta season two in July. However, the developer has now said it will be &quot;ending feature development&quot; on the game as a result of what it seemingly considers to be insurmountable legacy issues.

The 100-second clip comes courtesy of GameInformer, and features a bit of ultraviolence against new bipedal lizard foes known as Grims.


While a lot of it appears to be business as usual for God of War (Kratos still has his Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos, and Atreus retains his beloved bow and arrow), an accompanying write-up details some new combat additions, including Weapon Signature Moves.

Will this be when we finally get a glimpse of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s long-awaited multiplayer component? Will we see a single-player expansion? Or is this just more hairstyles for V?

This tribute recognises the work of Visual Arts producer Daniel Kinnard, who passed away during the game&#x27;s production.


His image can be seen immortalised within the game, where the developer has been reimagined as a pro baseball player for the Denver Skulls on a poster adorning the walls of the farmhouse players search when looking for Ellie.

                              <span>Two classic games from the Nintendo 64 era have met in a rather unusual crossover thanks to modders.
GoldenEye 007 has been given a Mario-inspired makeover, which sees a multitude of Koopas patrolling through a custom-made version of Nintendo 64&#x27;s Bomb-omb Battlefield with KF7 Soviet rifles and hand grenades.
Of course, the turtle-like foot soldiers and their Bob-omb comrades do not stand a chance against this Bond-like Mario protagonist and his own weaponary.

A few days ago, a logo for the plan, which was reportedly scraped from Xbox&#x27;s backend system, surfaced online.
Xbox has now made an official announcement unveiling the new plan, including details on what exactly it includes and pricing.

Riley and Rochelle from Sheinman Games will take players on a deductive journey, following the lives of two singers from two different backgrounds who fall in love... and also fall apart.


Players will create their own documentary about the two stars as they &quot;take a nuanced yet insider look at the pop culture world&quot; of the &#x27;90s. Diary entries, along with a catalogue of Riley and Rochelle&#x27;s older records, will work as a framework for the narrative, with the developer stating &quot;the player will choose how they want the film to end, and who gets to come out on top.&quot; Here&#x27;s a trailer:

(No, not like Ditto. Or those Pokémon that Mewtwo made in the movie.)


Pocket Monster Issue is a popular smartphone game in the country, and has been running for more than five years. According to the South China Morning Post (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), The Pokémon Company is seeking damages worth 500 million yuan (around £62m), and a series of public apologies posted on major gaming websites.

Nintendo&#x27;s smartphone version of Mario Kart currently allows you to dump currency into an in-game warp pipe in exchange for randomised rewards, such as characters and karts. 


This will soon be replaced by a Fortnite-style rotating item shop, where you can exchange currency for items directly.

The team, called Hel, is named after Norse mythology&#x27;s goddess of death and includes the elite players Olivia &quot;Olizia&quot; Nnenna Calistus, Agnė &quot;Karina&quot; Ivaškevičiūtė, Alena &quot;TIFA&quot; Maurer, Maya &quot;Caltys&quot; Henckel and Ève &quot;Colomblbl&quot; Monvoisin.


It follows the similarly all-female Valorant team G2 Gozen formed last year and proves G2&#x27;s commitment to boosting the visibility of women in esports and to eventually empower men and women to compete together in future.

This article introduces the Container Object Storage Interface (COSI), a standard for provisioning and consuming object storage in Kubernetes. It is an alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.25.
File and block storage are treated as first class citizens in the Kubernetes ecosystem via Container Storage Interface (CSI). Workloads using CSI volumes enjoy the benefits of portability across vendors and across Kubernetes clusters without the need to change application manifests. An equivalent standard does not exist for Object storage.
Object storage has been rising in popularity in recent years as an alternative form of storage to filesystems and block devices. Object storage paradigm promotes disaggregation of compute and storage. This is done by making data avail…</span>

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s acclaimed Medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is set to make its historical tapestry a little richer next Thursday, 8th September, with the arrival of the Friends and Foes Event Pack DLC, promising over a hundred new events.


These new player-driven stories, which can be encountered throughout ordinary play, all have relationships at their heart, but not necessarily the positive kind. One the one hand, players can &quot;uncover novel ways to become pals with those [they] hold dear or even achieve the coveted best friend status&quot;, but on the other, Paradox says players should &quot;be prepared for ever more dangerous rivals, sharpening their vengeful knives to get back at you.&quot;


Stories are at the heart of Crusader Kings 3, so more narrative options are always welcome, but those uninterested in laying down cash for the Friends &amp; Foes Event Pack will also have something to look forward to - a number of additional free features and changes will be arriving simultaneously as part of the new 1.7 Bastion Update.

                              <span>It&#x27;s fair to say that eyebrows were both raised and furrowed when Sega first shared footage of Sonic Frontiers back in June, but its latest trailer - a three-minute overview video breaking down the various features and gameplay flow of Sonic&#x27;s latest adventure - offers the clearest explanation yet of how things will unfold come its launch on 8th November if you&#x27;re still a little puzzled by the whole thing.


Granted, Sega&#x27;s plentiful, if scattershot, drip-feed of information over the last few months means none of the information in today&#x27;s trailer is particularly new, but it&#x27;s certainly more digestible - and understandable - than trying to mentally scoop together a picture of Sonic Frontiers from countless previews and reveals.


The gist, then, is that having somehow found his way into a strange dimension known as Cyber Space, Sonic escapes to Kronos - one of the Starfall Islands where players will be able to embark on Frontiers&#x27; non-linear &quot;open zone&quot; gameplay. Here, high-speed exploration and puzzling are the order of the day, with successful puzzling unlocking items that&#x27;ll increase Sonic&#x27;s power and defence and revealing new parts of each map.

                              <span>Warner Bros. is teasing the imminent arrival of Gremlins&#x27; adorable mogwai Gizmo to its free-to-play crossover fighter MultiVersus, with the company&#x27;s announcement pointing to a release next Tuesday, 6th September.


Although Warner Bros. is yet to officially namecheck Gizmo, a teaser trailer released today on Twitter shows a pair of very Gizmo-like hands and eyes popping out of the distinctive box used to transport the character in Gremlins and Gremlins 2: The New Batch.


What makes the Gizmo tease particularly interesting is that (despite his inclusion in the playable roster having been leaked earlier this year) the only Gremlins character so for officially confirmed for MultiVersus is Gizmo&#x27;s arch-nemesis Stripe.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has unveiled Toxoids, a new Species Pack DLC for Stellaris that&#x27;ll bring the &quot;most stubborn species in the game&#x27;s history&quot; when it comes to PC on 20th September.


Toxoids will give players the tools to &quot;gamble the future of their planets for immediate gains&quot; on release, with empires featuring the new species able to grow and adapt faster than most creatures - albeit often with nasty consequences for their neighbours and themselves.


To that end, the expansion introduces two new Origins: Knights of the Toxic God and Overtuned. The former revolves around a mysterious power rumoured to be buried under toxic sludge which can be unleashed on the galaxy if found, while the latter gives players the chance to play as a species able to gain more and more traits at the expense of their own lifespan.

&quot;What&#x27;s fortnight?&quot; Gaga tweeted, elliciting numerous responses.


One reply, from blue-haired Fortnite streamer Ninja, asked Gaga to play with him. &quot;who are you,&quot; was Gaga&#x27;s response.

With all the bizarre ways of playing, this feels inevitable right?


The one-handed run was already an impressive feat - especially as it was quickly followed by a one-handed level one All Remembrance run - but now she&#x27;s playing with her feet instead.

                              <span>343 Industries has shared its latest development roadmap, and it&#x27;s not good news. 


The biggest news is that the game&#x27;s next season has been delayed to March 2023. That&#x27;s an excruciatingly long time to wait. For context, Battlefield 2042, which released around the same time and also suffered delays, is also on Season 2, with the next Season planned for the end of this year. 


The bad news doesn&#x27;t end there, as split-screen local co-op has now been cancelled outright. &quot;In order to improve and accelerate ongoing live service development, and to better address player feedback and quality of life updates, we have reallocated studio resources and are no longer working on local campaign split-screen co-op,&quot; 343 said in an accompany development video.

                              <span>For those that had hoped to see upcoming space horror The Callisto Protocol make its way onto Xbox Games Pass at  release, this seems unlikely. 


Chatting to TrueAchievements, Striking Distance Studios&#x27; chief technology officer Mark James said the Game Pass model was a &quot;difficult&quot; one in financial terms for independent studios with single-player games - something The Callisto Protocol is.


&quot;I think those services are built towards some of the open-world style and repetitive multiplayer games. I think games [like that] survive well on that service,&quot; James said when discussing the possibility of seeing a title like The Callisto Protocol joining Game Pass.

Last week Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions released a statement explaining issues with the publisher that left the team &quot;feeling manipulated and exploited&quot;.



Now Corecell, the Thai developer behind AeternoBlade 2, has released a damning statement against the publisher to &quot;help other indie game developers to avoid what has happened to us and inform our fans about our situation&quot;.

                              <span>The PlayStation VR2 will be easier for developers to port the games onto, Sony has said.

The comments were made by Yasuo Takahashi and Kenjo Akiyama, two senior directors at Sony Interative Entertainment, at an event during Computer Entertainment Developers Conference (CEDEC) 2022.
The talk revealed new details about the software that will help developers in creating for or porting onto PSVR2 (reported by IGN).

                              <span>Fortnite has begun its second annual Pride event, Rainbow Royale, with a collection of free LGBTQ-themed cosmetics, and the arrival of DC&#x27;s transgender superhero Dreamer.


Nia Nal, otherwise known as Dreamer, debuted in the fourth season of Arrowverse series Supergirl, and was the first trans superhero in a TV show. By extension, this also makes Dreamer the first character confirmed as trans in Fortnite.


Dreamer will be available via Fortnite&#x27;s Item Shop later in the event, following a Zero Build Squads tournament where winners can collect the character early. Dreamer&#x27;s TV actress Nicole Maines is also on board, and will be streaming Fortnite in-character next week.

                              <span>Men of War 2, the sequel to the original cult RTS Men of War, will now release in 2023.


Developed by Ukrainian studio Best Way, this release has been delayed in order to &quot;accommodate new features and content suggested by its fans and improve the game itself&quot;. The development team noted that, due to the ongoing effects of the war in Ukraine, these improvements would not be possible to facilitate within the original timeframe. 


Along with this announcement, the developer also shared a new trailer for Men of War 2. This is titled &#x27;The Price of Victory&#x27;, and can be watched below.

As you would expect, Call of Duty, Overwatch and Diablo will be made available via Xbox Game Pass, Spencer said, if and when Microsoft&#x27;s $68bn buyout of Activision Blizzard is completed.


Spencer also made the guarantee that Xbox was &quot;committed to making the same version of Call of Duty available on PlayStation on the same day the game launches elsewhere&quot;.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority has concluded its initial investigation of Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, making the decision that the deal requires a more in-depth &quot;phase 2&quot; investigation. 


In its report, the CMA has determined that the deal will be &quot;giving rise to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


Crucially, the CMA decided the deal would have a large impact on the success of rival platforms: &quot;Evidence consistently pointed towards ABK&#x27;s content, especially Call of Duty, as being important and capable of making a material difference to the success of rivals&#x27; gaming platforms.&quot;

                              <span>A new trailer for Tchia has been released, giving us a closer look at the game&#x27;s tropical, New Caledonia-inspired setting. 


This trailer is narrated by the game&#x27;s director, Phil Crifo, and takes us from the island&#x27;s high peaks to the bottom of its azure ocean. Along the way, we are shown various methods of getting around the island in action. This includes things such as Tchia catapulting herself from the tops of trees and then gliding her way through the sky.


We also get another look at the game&#x27;s soul-jumping ability, which allows Tchia to quickly hop into the body of almost any animal or inanimate object she can find. This proves useful when she comes across the Maano, the game&#x27;s &quot;strange fabric creatures&quot; that have invaded Tchia&#x27;s home. In this case, she becomes a lantern, before later on becoming a coconut. You can see the trailer for yourself below.

The Australian Classification Board has jumped the gun and published its classification early, and it makes for a humorous read.  


The ACB warns that the game depicts &quot;tracking and killing of numerous opponents, with resulting examples of blood and injury detail.&quot;

                              <span>The Xbox mobile app for iOS and Android is getting a major upgrade to its search engine.


The update, which is available right now for beta users, improves the algorithm that powers game searches. 


Search for games on the Xbox app has been notoriously bad up until this point, igniting the console wars between PlayStation and Xbox fans since the PlayStation is relatively good at finding what you want.

                              <span>Promotional artwork for the still-unannounced Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage has popped up online, apparently from Ubisoft&#x27;s own store. 


The image, shared on Twitter by Assassin&#x27;s Creed fansite The Codex Network, appears to be for some kind of bonus quest. It shows a hooded Assassin hero armed with the series&#x27; iconic hidden blade weapon, facing down the silhouette of an enemy with a curved sword. 


Setting a story mission around the famous fable of The Forty Thieves would mirror other such bonus quests offered by Ubisoft in the past, such as a Beowulf-themed story for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla.

                              <span>Developer Endnight Games has announced &quot;one last&quot; delay for Sons of the Forest, with the horror-survival sequel now set to arrive on 23rd February next year.


Sons of the Forest is the direct sequel to Endnight&#x27;s well-received The Forest (which got its version 1.0 release in 2018 after four years in early access), a game that combined the survival genre&#x27;s penchant for scavenging and crafting with a genuinely unnerving horror element as protagonist Eric Leblanc searched the titular, cannibal-infested forest for his son following a harrowing plane crash.


Sons of the Forest, which this time sees players tracking down a  missing billionaire on a remote island, was originally due to launch in May this year, but Endnight made the decision to postpone its release to October in order to deliver its &quot;vision of the next step in survival games&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo is poised to reveal Switch ports of Wii U&#x27;s The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD and The Wind Waker HD according to a new report, with the announcement said to arrive as part of a new Nintendo Direct in September.


That&#x27;s according to GamesBeat managing editor Mike Minotti and the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb who, speaking during Grubb&#x27;s latest Game Mess podcast (thanks VGC), claimed to be &quot;very, very sure&quot; the dual Zelda port announcements were on the way.


&quot;100% there is a Nintendo Direct in September,&quot; said Grubb. &quot;I think there&#x27;s going to be a lot of Zelda stuff at this thing, I think this is going to be a Zelda blowout for Nintendo.&quot;

                              <span>Following July&#x27;s announcement that Ubisoft would be &quot;decommissioning&quot; the online portions of some of its older titles on 1st September, the publisher has said it&#x27;s postponing the move to 1st October in many cases, and that Anno 2070 will now escape unscathed.


Ubisoft originally announced that 15 titles that would be affected by the move: Anno 2070, Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2, Assassin&#x27;s Creed 3, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Brotherhood, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Liberation HD, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Revelations, Driver San Francisco, Far Cry 3, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, Rayman Legends, Silent Hunter 5, Space Junkies, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, and ZombiU.


The precise effects of decommissioning depend on the game, but ranged from the removal of multiplayer modes, online features, and DLC to being unable to access the game at all.

                              <span>Sam &amp; Max: Save the World and its follow-up season Beyond Time and Space will be making their way to Playstation in remastered form on 29th September.


Sam &amp; Max: Save the World and Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time and Space were, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, some of the earliest titles from The Walking Dead studio Telltale Games (releasing in 2006 and 2007 respectively), each serving up a six-episode arc of point-and-click mayhem starring Steve Purcell&#x27;s anarchic comic book crime-fighting dog and bunny duo.


While never quite living up to the lofty heights of LucasArts&#x27; 1993 classic Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road, both games bought their own wonderfully chaotic charms - Save the World&#x27;s story starting with former child stars running amok before taking increasingly bizarre turns, and Beyond Time and Space going even weirder with everything from vampires to Santa Claus.

                              <span>Raphaël Colantonio has revealed that nobody at Arkane Austin wanted Prey (2017) to be titled Prey, and how it felt &quot;gross&quot; to have release something under someone else&#x27;s IP.
Colantonio, known as the founder of Arkane Studios, served as the game&#x27;s director and writer. He announced his departure from the studio shortly after the game&#x27;s release, citing burnout and a desire to spend time with his son.

The fact that the game was never envisioned to be a part of the Prey IP isn&#x27;t new for fans of the game or Arkane. It was documented by NoClip last year, in which Colantonio and other leads on the game explained that Bethesda was insistent that Arkane&#x27;s next project had to be called Prey. Colantonio described the decision as a &quot;non-negotiable compromise&quot;.

Sadly, that does mean it seems Final Fantasy 16 is not set to be shown.

During the process, the group broke into the school’s IT systems; repurposed software used to monitor students’ computers; discovered a new vulnerability (and reported it); wrote their own scripts; secretly tested their system at night; and managed to avoid detection in the school’s network.

Kubernetes 1.25 brings cgroup v2 to GA (general availability), letting the
kubelet use the latest container resource
management capabilities.
What are cgroups?
Effective resource management is a
critical aspect of Kubernetes. This involves managing the finite resources in
your nodes, such as CPU, memory, and storage.
cgroups are a Linux kernel capability that establish resource management
functionality like limiting CPU usage or setting memory limits for running
processes.
When you use the resource management capabilities in Kubernetes, such as configuring
requests and limits for Pods and containers,
Kubernetes uses cgroups to enforce your resource requests and limits.
The Linux kernel offers two versions of cgroups: cgroup v1 and cgr…</span>

Both Kits launch next month, starting with The Sims 4 First Fits Kit on 1st September. This one&#x27;s all about expanded child Sims&#x27; clothing options with a bunch of &#x27;fashionable and cute&#x27; outfits, some of which you can see in the header image above. 


&quot;Dress child Sims in trendy looks that are perfect for birthday parties, the classroom or just hanging out with friends,&quot; explains EA. &quot;Start your child Sims on a lifetime of trend-setting fashion and allow them to express themselves with the kinds of leopard-print jackets, patterned leggings and colorful shades they’ll want to wear when they grow up.&quot;

                              <span>Spade-wielding platform hero Shovel Knight will be embarking on a brand-new adventure on 23rd September, when Shovel Knight Dig launches for Steam, Switch, and Apple Arcade.


Shovel Knight Dig, a collaboration between Yacht Club Games and UK studio Nitrome, feels like it&#x27;s been a long time coming, having first been revealed all the way back in 2019 - when Yacht Club explained it would take players deep into an &quot;ever-changing chasm of mystery&quot;.


More specifically, it&#x27;ll pit Shovel Knight against Drill Knight and his digging crew in a quest that&#x27;ll see adventurers jumping, slashing, and tunnelling their way downward through stages procedurally stitched together from &quot;thousands&quot; of level chunks in a bid to reach the bottom.

                              <span>Rocksmith+, the new subscription service version of Ubisoft&#x27;s long-running guitar learning series, finally has a release date and is coming to PC next Tuesday, 6th September.


Rocksmith+ was, you may recall, originally due to launch last summer, but Ubisoft made the decision to postpone its release based on player feedback during its closed beta, saying it wanted to &quot;ensure we provide the best guitar learning experience [and] deliver a smoother experience for all guitar and bass lovers&quot;.


Nearly twelve months later, Rocksmith+ is finally ready for release and will launch next week via the Ubisoft Store, promising a range of tools to help players hone their music skills. These include interactive lessons featuring Adaptive Difficulty - said to dynamically adjust to a player&#x27;s skill level while they play - and the Rocksmith+ Connect app for iOS and Android, which will take care of note detection and real-time feedback without the need for any peripherals.

                              <span>Victoria 3, the latest entry in Paradox Interactive&#x27;s long-dormant society builder series, has been given a release date and is coming to PC and Xbox Game Pass for PC on 25th October.


Victoria, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar (which wouldn&#x27;t be all that surprising given that the previous game in the series released well over a decade ago), transports players back to the era of the Industrial Revolution for a take on Paradox&#x27;s beloved grand strategy genre that&#x27;s a little closer to a management game compared to the, say, RPG leanings of Crusader Kings.


Here, the focus is on building up the economic machinery of your state and country at the height of industrialisation - a process primarily achieved by tweaking and tinkering within your own borders, managing your people and fulfilling their needs to address political and societal challenges and deal with diplomacy further afield.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has shown off seven uncut minutes of The Last of Us Part 1 ahead of its launch on PlayStation 5 this week.


The video, below, shows the Bill&#x27;s Town section of the game. Joel, Ellie and Bill begin by stealthily taking down enemies before things go downhill. The gameplay ends with a Bloater fight in a gymnasium.


This video is one of our best looks yet at the scope of Naughty Dog&#x27;s high-profile remaster of its 2013 hit PlayStation 3 game.

It&#x27;s unclear at present exactly what the collaboration will include, though it&#x27;s likely to be themed around the film specifically.

Yesterday a tweet from the official Pokémon account showed &quot;photographs&quot; from a Paldean photographer showing &quot;strange markings&quot;.


Today it&#x27;s confirmed these are from a new Pokémon called Grafaiai who&#x27;s &quot;quite difficult to catch in action&quot;.

Now YouTuber j0nathan has released a new video detailing information on the game that&#x27;s been corroborated by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier.

                              <span>Some people appear to have played FIFA 23 a month before its official launch - and Ultimate Team player statistics are now flooding online.


FIFA 23 looks like it was playable for a brief period of time today on Xbox consoles after a pre-load went live to those who pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition. The EA Play trial may also have gone live early, allowing players access. FIFA 23 isn&#x27;t meant to go live until 27th September.


Surprisingly, some players were able to play the game, and even access Ultimate Team mode. One Twitch user, called mexico07dan1, even streamed FIFA 23 before suffering an account ban. However, clips of the stream, including the one below, remain online at the time of publication.

                              <span>Netflix has added a gamertag system to some of its games, with more social features apparently in the pipeline.
&quot;Game handles&quot;, a unique and public username, were first spotted in the Netflix app by Steve Moser (later reported by Tech Crunch).
The launch of this feature happened quietly last month and is currently only available for some of Netflix&#x27;s games, including Into the Breach, Mahjong Solitaire and Heads Up!. Only letters and numbers can be used in handles, which will be displayed publicly while playing instead of a profile icon and name.

                              <span>Sony has moved to reassure fans of its big budget single-player PlayStation games, as it announces a fresh PlayStation Studios Mobile Division.


Writing via the PlayStation blog, studios boss Hermen Hulst listed this year&#x27;s various PS4 and PS5 games - &quot;huge releases including Horizon Forbidden West, Gran Turismo 7, MLB The Show 22, and on November 9th, the highly anticipated God of War: Ragnarök&quot; - as well as PlayStation VR2, to demonstrate its commitment to console gaming.


At the same time, Hulst announced Sony was acquiring Savage Game Studios, a mobile game team based in Berlin and Helsinki, and folding it into the new PlayStation Studios Mobile Division, which will &quot;operate independently from our console development and focus on innovative, on-the-go experiences based on new and existing PlayStation IP&quot;.

The game is the third in the Gungrave series - the first in 18 years - and is being developed by South Korean studio Iggymob.

                              <span>Warner Bros has filed a trademark for Big Chungus for use in video games, causing speculation (and hope!) that the supersized bunny is coming to MultiVersus.
The trademark, filed on 26th August with the European Union Intellectual Property Office, also covers a range of other things such as films, clothing, and toys. Whilst Big Chungus is perfect material for a soft toy, it seems more likely that he is being added to MultiVersus, given the game&#x27;s popularity and broad roster of fighters.

For those of you who aren&#x27;t aware of this absolute unit, let me explain.

                              <span>In not-all-that-surprising news, Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 has confirmed work is underway on a new Mafia title.


The confirmation came over the weekend from studio general manager Roman Hladík, in an interview celebrating 20 years of the series.


It was reported back in May this year that a fresh Mafia game was indeed in development at Hangar 13, and that it would apparently be set before the existing Mafia trilogy. This would place the game back in the prohibition era of the original - or perhaps earlier.

                              <span>DICE has shown off new gameplay footage of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s latest map: Stranded.


Set in the drained carcass of the Panama Canal, fitting the broader climate-apocalypse theme of the game, Stranded is a small-sized map with a focus on infantry combat. You can read more about the map and my initial impressions here.


You can also have look at how Breakthrough and Conquest 64 plays out on the map through gameplay captured during a hands-on session.

The timing of this couldn&#x27;t have fallen (or been planned) better on HTC&#x27;s part. Combined with the current cost of living crisis in the UK and the price hikes of both PlayStation 5 and Meta Quest 2, a discount is sorely welcomed.
For UK customers, the full list of discounts includes:

                              <span>The NSA has has published criteria for evaluating levels of assurance required for DoD microelectronics.
The introductory report in a DoD microelectronics series outlines the process for determining levels of hardware assurance for systems and custom microelectronic components, which include application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and other devices containing reprogrammable digital logic.
The levels of hardware assurance are determined by the national impact caused by failure or subversion of the top-level system and the criticality of the component to that top-level system. The guidance helps programs acquire a better understanding of their system and components so that they can effectively mitigate against threats...</span>

CSI Inline Volumes were introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.15 and have been beta since 1.16. We are happy to announce that this feature has graduated to General Availability (GA) status in Kubernetes 1.25.
CSI Inline Volumes are similar to other ephemeral volume types, such as configMap, downwardAPI and secret. The important difference is that the storage is provided by a CSI driver, which allows the use of ephemeral storage provided by third-party vendors. The volume is defined as part of the pod spec and follows the lifecycle of the pod, meaning the volume is created once the pod is scheduled and destroyed when the pod is destroyed.
What&#x27;s new in 1.25?
There are a couple of new bug fixes related to this feature in 1.25, and the CSIInlineVolum…</span>

                              <span>Valve has commenced rolling out a new version of its Steam Mobile app.

Not everyone will be able to give it a try just yet, though, as right now it&#x27;s only available as part of &quot;a limited beta&quot;. Valve said it&#x27;s holding off from a public release in order to ensure the app works on &quot;so many different phones and devices&quot;.

&quot;We’ve rebuilt the app on a new framework and modernized the design,&quot; Valve said in a brief blog post on the website, before cheekily adding: &quot;(2015 called and wanted their app back).

                              <span>Blizzard is redesigning Diablo Immortal&#x27;s legendary crests to &quot;help differentiate&quot; them from the eternal legendary chests that cost players real money.

Responding to a post in the game&#x27;s subreddit, lead designer Wyatt Cheng said that the team not only wanted to ensure the colours were different, but also change their shape, too, so &quot;players know exactly what they&#x27;re getting when they make a purchase&quot;. 

&quot;This is artwork that we&#x27;re working on to help differentiate the Legendary Crest (which will become [the] Orange one) from the Eternal Legendary Crest (which will remain the purple one in the middle, that yields gems that can be sold on the Market),&quot; Cheng explained.

That&#x27;s according to game director Tony Huynh, who - whilst responding to a question posed by a player on Twitter - said that as the team&#x27;s current focus is &quot;stabilising [MultiVersus&#x27;] experience&quot;, any plans to integrate couch co-op is &quot;further out&quot;.

Huynh added that right now, &quot;netcode improvements, hurt/hitboxes, projectiles, platform interactions&quot; are most important to the team (thanks, NME).

Reportedly taken from Xbox&#x27;s own backend system, it comes just weeks after Microsoft revealed that it was trialling an Xbox Game Pass tier that would permit players to share their Game Pass subscription with friends and family members.

Called Xbox Game Pass Insider Preview, the service allows users - currently restricted to Ireland and Colombia - to &quot;add up to four people to [their] subscription, all with their own unique access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games, content, and benefits&quot; (thanks, VGC). The newly discovered logo has yet to be formally shared with the public.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers will weigh in at 10.4GB on Nintendo Switch.

That makes it bulkier than prior Blue Blur games on Switch - as our friends at Nintendo Life point out, Sonic Forces was 6.6GB, and Sonic Colors: Ultimate was 6.8GB - and gives us a hint at how much bigger the latest instalment, set to be an open-world of course, will be.

As for what the game entails? The official store description says: &quot;In search of the missing Chaos emeralds, Sonic becomes stranded on an ancient island teeming with unusual creatures. Battle hordes of powerful enemies as you explore a breathtaking world of action, adventure, and mystery.

As spotted by Nintendo dataminer OatmealDome, Nintendo is reportedly cracking down on players who are modifying the game, including a patch that let players prematurely enter the testing range. 

Affected players are getting console bans and &quot;possibly&quot; total bans from subscription service Nintendo Switch Online, too, without which players cannot access multiplayer features.

In an interview at Gamescom, CEO Stephen Kick confirmed that whilst his studio retains the right to remake the first - and potentially second - game from the series, rights to the third game were sold to Tencent.

&quot;When we originally acquired the rights to the franchise, we licensed the rights for the third game to Warren and Paul [Neurath] at Otherside. They then subsequently sold their rights to Tencent,&quot; he told VGC.

In an interview with NME at Gamescom, 10 Chambers&#x27; creative director and CEO Ulf Andersson said that after working on Payday and Payday 2 before leaving for make GTFO with 10 Chambers, he still yearns to work on another heist game, saying &quot;it feels like an unclosed chapter&quot;.

&quot;So for me, this game is a game that just has to be made,&quot; Andersson said. &quot;I’m back on the heist shit, basically – so it’s a heist cooperative FPS, and it has a sort of a techno-thriller theme. I read a lot of sci-fi books, and so imagine everything that cyberpunk is inspired by, and a ton of other shit.

                              <span>Diablo 2: Resurrected has launched a public test realm for the upcoming 2.5 patch that boasts an all-new &quot;experimental&quot; feature: Terror Zones.

As well as a &quot;variety of bug fixes to address feedback the community has provided&quot; Blizzard, Terror Zones see you take up monsters at least two levels higher than you (or their original level) for extra XP and loot in the hope we&#x27;ll stop &quot;repeatedly farming&quot; Baal, Diablo, or Nihlathak.

&quot;The journey to level 99 is a celebrated experience for players and quite the milestone if achieved - a rite of passage, even,&quot; Blizzard explains in the patch notes. &quot;We want to offer an alternative to repeatedly farming Baal, Diablo, or Nihlathak. We also want the journey to level 99 to be accessible to a larger population of players, full of variety, and most importantly, challenging - this is where Terror Zones come in. As we get into details, please note that players can choose to opt-out of Terror Zones if desired.

                              <span>In news that&#x27;s unlikely to surprise you, Netflix has cancelled its Resident Evil series after just a single season.

The show - which stars Ella Balinska, Tamara Smart, and Lance Reddick - only debuted on 14th July, but Deadline reports that &quot;as the drama did not have a particularly strong showing on Netflix&#x27;s Top 10 and cost vs. viewing is the streamer&#x27;s leading renewal criterion&quot;, Netflix has declined to order a second series.

                              <span>I’ve been saying that complexity is the worst enemy of security for a long time now. (Here’s me in 1999.) And it’s been true for a long time.
In 2018, Thomas Dullien of Google’s Project Zero talked about “cheap complexity.” Andrew Appel summarizes:
The anomaly of cheap complexity.  For most of human history, a more complex device was more expensive to build than a simpler device.  This is not the case in modern computing. It is often more cost-effective to take a very complicated device, and make it simulate simplicity, than to make a simpler device.  This is because of economies of scale: complex general-purpose CPUs are cheap.  On the other hand, custom-designed, ...</span>

                              <span>Guacamelee developer Drinkbox Studios has announced Frozen Hearth, a new chunk of paid DLC heading to its action-RPG Nobody Saves the World on 13th September.


Frozen Hearth takes players to a forgotten new region, deep underground, &quot;where the strongest warriors compete for glory in The Tempering&quot;. Here, hardy adventurers can tackle a series of puzzles and challenges intended to test their transformation skills and creativity, unlocking the new Killer Bee and Mechanic forms that can be used in the DLC and main game.


&quot;When we shipped the original game, there were so many ideas we had to leave on the cutting room floor, and this DLC gave us a chance to bring some of them to life,&quot; Nobody Saves the World lead designer Ian Campbell explained in a statement accompanying today&#x27;s announcement. &quot;We had a blast creating even more forms, as well as puzzles and challenges that make the most of the game’s mix-and-match customisation&quot;.

                              <span>Digital Extremes has shared more on Warframe&#x27;s Veilbreaker update, confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for all platforms some time in September, and that players will be able to get instant free access to Styanax - the sci-fi shooter&#x27;s 50th Warframe - for two weeks after its arrival.


Styanax - who gets a proper introduction in the animated Ascension Day trailer below - is described as a &quot;mighty and herculean&quot; Warframe whose designed is inspired by the ancient Greek warrior Astyanax. His abilities include the Axios Javelin - which can push back enemies on impact, causing damage if they hit a wall - and the Tharros Strike shield, capable of repelling enemies and reducing their shields and armour as it&#x27;s swung around, regenerating Styanax&#x27;s health with each successfully landed blow.

Styanax can also call on Rally Point to draw enemies to his position and regenerate the energy and shields of nearby allies (regeneration increases as the number of enemies near him grows), or deploy Final Stand - causing him to rise into the air and unleash a barrage of javelins that&#x27;ll damage nearby enemies upon hitting the ground. Additional damage occurs on a direct hit.

                              <span>Developer Sloclap has detailed Sifu&#x27;s big summer update - which is set to bring the likes of a new scoring system and gameplay modifiers - ahead of its arrival next Wednesday, 31st August.


Top of the list of new additions for the kung-fu beat-&#x27;em-up is the aforementioned new scoring system, which will &quot;take into account every punch, kick, sweep and finisher performed&quot; in order to rank players based on smoothness, efficiency and variety. &quot;Dismantle a group of enemies without getting hit,&quot; Sloclap adds, &quot;and players will be greeted with a score worth flaunting.&quot;


Elsewhere, next week&#x27;s update brings a range of modifiers designed to suit all tastes. At one end of the spectrum, struggling players will be able to significantly reduce Sifu&#x27;s challenge by giving themselves the likes of infinite health, structure, and unbreakable weapons. Those looking to further test their mettle, however, can prevent themselves from picking up weapons and set enemies to ignore guarding, or go even further by reducing their character down to a single hit point and bumping enemy strength up even further.

This includes a new feature that will enable players to play dialogue through the console&#x27;s DualSense controller as haptic feedback.


This new feature, which started off as a prototype, means that &quot;a deaf player can feel the way a line is delivered, can feel the emphasis, along with the subtitles to give some sense of how that line is delivered,&quot; explained game director Matthew Gallant.

                              <span>A new trailer for Team Ninja&#x27;s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty has been released, showing off gameplay for the first time.


The Soulslike game was announced during the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase in June and will be released in 2023 across Xbox consoles and PC (Game Pass on both), and PlayStation consoles.


It&#x27;s led by producers Fumihiko Yasuda (Nioh) and Masaaki Yamagiwa (Bloodborne), and judging by the below trailer it certainly looks familiar.

                              <span>The long-rumoured white Xbox Elite Series 2 controller - pictured above - has been spotted again online.

Earlier this month, footage of the controller surfaced on YouTube, and pictures of its packaging were posted to Twitter back in March.

Microsoft has not made an official statement regarding the white controller&#x27;s release, or even acknowledging that it is real, but more solid evidence of its existence has appeared.

Back in May, Square Enix sold off its western studios and IP (including Tomb Raider and Deus Ex) to Embracer for just $300m.



Now, three months later, the acquisition has been completed, according to a press release from Embracer.

                              <span>As part of its latest Treehouse: Live showcase, Nintendo has shared a lengthy look at Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming fantasy farming sim Harvestella, showing off its story, its world exploration and combat, its farming, fishing, and more.


Harvestella - a sort of blend of Final Fantasy, Harvest Moon, and Rune Factory - begins with players waking up with a bad case of amnesia in a world where the seasons are governed by four giant crystals known as Seaslight. Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.


And that&#x27;s not the end of their problems; as players settle into a vacant house on the outskirts of Lethe Village, a huge comet falls to the earth nearby, bringing with it the armoured body of an Omen, thought to be the cause of the calamity. We see some of this in Nintendo&#x27;s showcase, but the bulk of the play-through is focused around Harvestella&#x27;s second chapter as players start to explore the dungeon-like Higan Canyon, with help from new pal Dianthus.

                              <span>Nintendo has joined Microsoft in responding to this week&#x27;s shock PlayStation 5 price hike, and said it had &quot;no plans&quot; to similarly bump up the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s cost.


In a statement issued to Eurogamer this morning, Nintendo confirmed it had &quot;no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware&quot;. 


The response goes further than that of Microsoft&#x27;s, which last night noted Sony&#x27;s dramatic decision by simply stating it was keen to &quot;offer our fans great gaming options&quot;, before reiterating the Xbox Series X and S&#x27;s launch price point.

As a reminder, Splatoon lore fans believe that Nintendo&#x27;s shooter series is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the sea levels have risen and much of our current world is underwater.


Indeed, the new map - apparently uncovered from the files of Splatoon 3&#x27;s World Premiere Splatfest demo - appears to support that claim.

                              <span>Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a new Puzzle Bobble game exclusive to Nintendo Switch.

If you don&#x27;t know what Puzzle Bobble is, it started out as a match-three arcade game based off Bubble Bobble. Players are faced with a prearranged pattern of coloured bubbles, and must fire bubbles up towards their matching colours to clear the screen before the bubbles get too low.
Bubble Bobble&#x27;s Puzzle Bobble&#x27;s Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! sure is one heck of a tongue twister.

In its announcement, the company invited publishers to include Denuvo&#x27;s anti-tamper software in Switch games to help crack down on piracy and PC emulation. But many fans were not happy with Denuvo&#x27;s involvement, worried about the effect the software may have on performance.

The big purple creature first appeared in Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast and has since become a fan favourite character, appearing in a number of games in the series.


It&#x27;s been known for a while that Big the Cat would feature, but thanks to Twitter user Bibs he&#x27;s been spotted with Sonic in-game at Gamescom.

But don&#x27;t expect to hear more on this project anytime soon, Creative Assembly said today. Instead, there will be a &quot;significant wait before further details are revealed&quot; on this new franchise. Intriguingly, the company noted it also had plans for a separate &quot;yet to be announced project&quot;. 


While Creative Assembly did not go into any specifics about what its new action project will look like, it did state that its studio in Sofia would be leading its development, and noted it was now looking for candidates to join the team that had &quot;experience working on third-person titles using the Unreal 5 engine&quot;.

Reportedly due out this November, publisher EA has officially kept very quiet about its upcoming racer, which was previously delayed from 2021. 


This week, screenshots apparently from a work-in-progress build of the still-untitled game began to appear on reddit. Last night, the brief gameplay clip these images were taken from was also posted.

                              <span>Following Sony&#x27;s announcement that it will be raising the price of PlayStation 5 in select countries, Microsoft has responded to the news, merely noting that existing Xbox Series X/S prices remain the same.


Sony announced it would be increasing the cost of PlayStation 5 - in response to &quot;high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends&quot; - earlier today, with the price hike impacting most markets around the world, effective immediately.


That increase affects both the disc and disc-less models of PS5, and equates to £30 in the UK and €50 in Europe - with similar bumps occurring in Japan, China, Australia, Mexico, and Canada, but not the US for the time being.

                              <span>Following Netflix&#x27;s announcement earlier this year that it&#x27;s adapting Irrational Games&#x27; acclaimed shooter BioShock into a live-action film, the streaming service has revealed it&#x27;s now secured a writer and director for the project.


When word of the BioShock adaptation first broke in February, there was little to go on beyond the fact it was being developed alongside publisher Take-Two and Vertigo Entertainment with an eye on turning it into a cinematic universe.


Now, though, Netflix has revealed that two key roles on the project have now been filled, with Francis Lawrence having signed on in the director role.

                              <span>It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks since Capcom dropped the first free title update for Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion, but already the publisher is teasing Update 2, with a first look at incoming new monster variant Flaming Espinas.


Espinas returned to the Monster Hunter series back in August with the launch of Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion, marking the first time the creature had made the roster in a new game since its debut in 2008&#x27;s Monster Hunter Frontier 2.0.


In its base form, Espinas is a Flying Wyvern capable of paralysis, poison, and fireblight, and while Capcom is yet to reveal how Title Update 2&#x27;s new Flaming Espinas variant will differ, there&#x27;s a look at the creature in the publisher&#x27;s newly revealed teaser trailer below.

                              <span>Anyone with a hankering for some glum action-adventuring should keep an eye on the Epic Games Store next, when Shadow of the Tomb Raider - the final instalment in Square Enix&#x27;s gloomy rebooted series - will be free to download, alongside Submerged: Hidden Depths.


Shadow of the Tomb Raider, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, picks up its narrative around a year after the events of 2015&#x27;s Rise of the Tomb Raider, following young Lara Croft as she races through the Peruvian jungle in a bid to stop a Mayan apocalypse.


&quot;This is a well-crafted and polished experience,&quot; Eurogamer&#x27;s Aoife Wilson wrote in her Shadow of the Tomb Raider review in 2018, &quot;and when [it] actually gives you full control and leaves you alone to seek out its quieter mysteries, it can render you wide-eyed with wonder&quot;.

Previously, a few of the aircraft to appear in it were confirmed for the special edition during the Xbox Showcase back in June.
Meanwhile, the game&#x27;s first ever city update, available from today, is detailed in an Xbox blog. Five German photogrammetry cities have been added to the game: Hanover, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Bonn and Cologne.

Now, it has been announced that Steve Blackman, who is the showrunner for The Umbrella Academy (as well as working on the currently in development ISS drama Orbital) will be responsible for this upcoming adaptation (via Deadline).

Blackman spoke of his enthusiasm for the Netflix project, calling Guerrilla&#x27;s Horizon Zero Dawn an &quot;exceptionally well-crafted game with wonderful characters not often seen in the rank-and-file of the gaming world.&quot;

Its recent financial report revealed the company fell short of Wall Street&#x27;s Q3 expectations, blaming &quot;challenging market conditions&quot; for this setback (via CNBC).

Two weeks ago, Nvidia predicted it would not meet Wall Street&#x27;s finacial estimates, commenting that it had seen a significant slow down in growth driven by &quot;disappointing&quot; sales. At this time, Nvidia also stated it would see a decline in its gross margin.

                              <span>Ahead of its appearance at Gamescom, Eurogamer was given the chance to watch a pre-prepared keynote on The Devil In Me, the next instalment and first season finale of Supermassive Games’ The Dark Pictures Anthology. The preview, hosted by director Tom Heaton, included footage from one of the episode’s later scenes, and a look at its various gameplay improvements.

This early look began by introducing the story and main characters of The Devil In Me, and setting up its stakes. Supermassive’s latest horror chapter centres on Lonnit Entertainment, a small TV production company developing a documentary series on famous serial killers, and a gentleman named Granthem Du&#x27;Met, who inherited a hotel with reproductions of rooms from HH Holmes&#x27; infamous “Murder Castle”. Once the team arrives to meet Du&#x27;Met, however, it&#x27;s clear the hotel is a much more accurate reproduction than they previously realised.
Kate Wilder, played by Jessie Buckley, stars as the show&#x27;s presenter. In our preview she was described as introverted and lacking self-confidence, but with a fierce determination to do the right thing. Heaton later told me that Wilder was &quot;quite damaged&quot; when I asked more about the character. &quot;She&#x27;s carrying this secret most of the people on the crew don&#x27;t know about at all,&quot; he said, and added that she could sometimes snap at people while attempting to process issues from the past.

                              <span>Sony has announced a shock price rise for the PlayStation 5, and in a Eurogamer Newscast special, we&#x27;re here to discuss why the company has pulled this undoubtedly unpopular move - and why it&#x27;s likely to get away with it. 

Will Sony sell fewer PS5s as a result? It seems unlikely. But it&#x27;s more pressure on PlayStation, which has already had to defend its £70/$70 price point for games - including the upcoming The Last of Us: Part 1 remaster - and just this week announced an expensive-looking new PlayStation 5 controller. 
At a time when all of us are looking at our bank balance&#x27;s bottom line, an extra £30 to buy a PS5 marks not just an unprecedented decision by Sony, but a troubling sign of the times. Will Microsoft now feel emboldened to follow suit, or soak up any extra costs as a point of difference? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan discuss.

                              <span>Fear Effect Reinvented just re-emerged with its first gameplay trailer - and the promise of a release date sooner than we think.

                              <span>FromSoftware has finally managed to get Dark Souls 3 back online, seven months after PC PvP servers had to be shut down.
Back in January, PC servers for all Dark Souls games were shuttered due to security issues - and remained down for months. In July, at the 183 day mark, there were signs that Dark Souls 3 could be back online soon - but still no fix.
Now, at well over 200 days, the PC servers for Dark Souls 3 are now live again. Rejoice!

Microsoft observed a campaign that inserted an attacker-controlled proxy site between the account users and the work server they attempted to log into. When the user entered a password into the proxy site, the proxy site sent it to the real server and then relayed the real server’s response back to the user. Once the authentication was completed, the threat actor stole the session cookie the legitimate site sent, so the user doesn’t need to be reauthenticated at every new page visited.

The release of Kubernetes v1.25 marks a major milestone for Kubernetes out-of-the-box pod security
controls: Pod Security admission (PSA) graduated to stable, and Pod Security Policy (PSP) has been
removed.
PSP was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.21,
and no longer functions in Kubernetes v1.25 and later.
The Pod Security admission controller replaces PodSecurityPolicy, making it easier to enforce predefined
Pod Security Standards by
simply adding a label to a namespace. The Pod Security Standards are maintained by the K8s
community, which means you automatically get updated security policies whenever new

                              <span>Following a not exactly inspiring showing earlier this month, Square Enix has once again reached deep into its Forspokeon promotional sack, this time pulling out a ten-minute trailer showcasing new gameplay from its upcoming open-world fantasy adventure.


Forspoken casts players in the role of Frey Holland - played by Ella Balinska - an &quot;ordinary young woman who must harness her magical abilities to survive&quot; in a &quot;beautiful yet cruel&quot; world of Athia. We get a much better closer at that world in Square&#x27;s latest trailer, which includes a glimpse of the city of Cipal, Athia&#x27;s only safe haven, where refugees gather to escape the corrupting force of the Break. 


Here, players can speak to citizens to take on quests and trade before heading out to explore Athia&#x27;s more dangerous regions, including Praenost - a barren desert where the only signs of life are corrupted enemies - and the lush region of Avoalet with its dangerously mutated beasts.

                              <span>Supermassive Games has announced a release date for its latest Dark Pictures Anthology entry The Devil in Me, which is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 18th November.


The Devil in Me will be the fourth instalment in Supermassive&#x27;s Dark Pictures series - following on from Man of Medan, Little Hope, and House of Ashes - and tells the story of a group of film makers trapped in a replica of H. H. Holmes&#x27; infamous &#x27;Murder Castle&#x27; hotel.


Based on everything shown so far, The Devil in Me looks to be something of a departure from previous anthology entries, trading their supernatural overtones for a more grounded, grisly horror inspired by the likes of the Saw and Hostel movies.

Sigh.

This evening&#x27;s The Future Games Show ended with a fancy CGI trailer showing off the world of Off the Grid, a free-to-play third-person shooter battle royale from new developer Gunzilla Games.

                              <span>Back in June, Bloober Team - the developer behind The Medium, Observer, and Blair Witch - announced it was remaking Layers of Fear 1 &amp; 2 as a single &quot;psychedelic horror chronicle&quot;, and now the studio has shared a first look at a &quot;brand-new story chapter&quot; in its latest trailer.


Layers of Fears, as the remake is officially (and ridiculously) known, is being co-developed with Anshar Studios, and will see the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, complete with new visuals, gameplay, and expanded plot lines said to &quot;cast a new light on the overarching narrative&quot; as players face &quot;spine-chilling madness that extends over generations.&quot;


The first Layers of Fear game, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, charted the story of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece while Layers of Fear 2 told the tale of an actor making a movie onboard a labyrinthine ocean liner, with both games serving up some striking psychedelic imagery as each protagonist began to lose their grip on reality.

The Great War: Western Front, set for launch on PC at some point in 2023, lets you play as both Theatre Commander and Field Commander in a dual-role.


Theatre Commander presents turn-based grand-strategy gameplay as you direct the deployment of forces, perform research and manage your resources across the Western Front.

                              <span>An intriguing-sounding psychological thriller called The Gap was announced during the Future Games Show this evening.
It&#x27;s described as a hard sci-fi first-person narrative game set in 2045, not that the sci-fi elements are particularly apparent from the debut trailer. This shows you, a neuroscientist called Joshua Hayes, waking up on the floor of presumably your own apartment, with a voice - and written messages on the walls - telling you not to trust anyone. But you can&#x27;t remember what is going on.
Hayes suffers from a rare genetic disorder that affects his memory, so the focus in the game is trying to recover those memories by re-experiencing them. The catalyst for this is déjà vu, triggered by objects that act like a bridge to a parallel reality to experience memories again. But there&#x27;s tragedy hiding in your past, too.

Build A Rocket Boy, which is based in Edinburgh, currently lists three positions based on blockchain development on its website, including a senior backend programmer, smart contract developer and test engineer.


Is Everywhere a blockchain game? Does it include NFTs? What, actually, is Everywhere? These questions were all floating around the internet this morning, after a particularly vague reveal for the game last night during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live ceremony, where we saw a trailer for the title that gave little away.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re picking out our favourite bits - and not so favourites - from this week&#x27;s big Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase. 

It&#x27;s a relatively quiet year for Gamescom - though it is lovely to see the show back on its feet and filled with sweaty attendees - and it&#x27;s fair to say this was reflected in last night&#x27;s showings. We got a big reveal for Dead Island 2 - which is not set on an island - and a release date for Return to Monkey Island, but otherwise, surprises were thin on the ground, and there were a lot of CGI trailers.


Those aside, and ignoring Kojima shilling his podcast, we still got an array of interesting games to look forward to over the next 12 months, even if not all of them were AAA-sized or from franchises you might have heard of. I particularly liked the look of Moonbreaker, Atlus Fallen and Where Winds Meet, games I&#x27;d never heard of before last night. But what did everyone else think? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said he&#x27;d like to see more game releases that are not tied down to one specific platform, which will in turn allow for more cross-play opportunities.


Chatting to Bloomberg, Spencer stated that platform exclusives are something we were all going to see &quot;less and less of&quot; in future, as he hopes for an industry that encourages people to feel safe and included &quot;regardless of what device&quot; they play on.


Spencer said he also wanted to see more cross-play possibilties on the market. &quot;Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox and I buy a PlayStation and our kids want to play together and they can&#x27;t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television,&quot; he explained.

                              <span>The company behind controversial anti-piracy software Denuvo has announced an &quot;innovative solution&quot; to the piracy of Nintendo Switch games on PC.
Irdeto today published a press release about its Nintendo Switch Emulator Protection solution, as a call to developers and publishers who may be interested in including it with their games. In its statement, Irdeto targets not only first-party and second-party Switch games, but ports of PC games too.

&quot;Nintendo consoles have long suffered from piracy issues and the Switch is no different,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Even if a game is protected against piracy on its PC version, the released version on Switch can be emulated from day one and played on PC, therefore bypassing the strong protections offered on the PC version.&quot;

The McLaren MP4/4 marked the end of the Turbo era and was driven by Ayrton Senna in 1988 to win the drivers&#x27; championship. It&#x27;s now available to drive in-game.


Three other cars have also been included: the Pontiac GTO &#x27;The Judge&#x27; &#x27;69, the Porsche Cayman GT4 &#x27;16, and the De Tomaso Mangusta (Christian Dior).

No content will be lost from expansions from this point forward, Bungie pledged last night during its packed Destiny 2 announcement livestream.


However, the game&#x27;s fabled Content Vault will still continue to gobble up some stuff, including season content beyond its expansion&#x27;s launch year.

                              <span>In its first Community Update, Techland has revealed changes coming to Dying Light 2 Stay Human.


So far the improvements are mainly visual. A new Colour Grading option has been added that allows players to change to a &quot;gritty&quot; look similar to the 2019 gameplay presentations.


Other visual improvements include new screen space ambient occlusion implementation, image clarity improvements including temporal anti-aliasing and texture filtering, and the ability to toggle Chromatic Aberration.

But more games are coming as shown in the below montage, many of which are day one releases.

                              <span>Toge Productions, the Indonesian indie developer behind Coffee Talk, has today issued a damning statement announcing a delay to its next project due to issues with publisher PQube.


The lengthy public announcement, made this morning via Twitter, accuses PQube of misusing money gained from a diversity fund. Toge Productions claims it should have received this money - part of a scheme from a &quot;well known console platform&quot; - to help finance its upcoming project A Space For The Unbound.


&quot;The diversity fund was a grant fund intended to help underrepresented game developers, especially during the pandemic,&quot; Toge Productions wrote. &quot;However, instead of giving those funds to the developers as the grant was intended, PQube Games intentionally withheld information about the grant and used it as a leverage for their own commercial gain.

                              <span>A swanky new gaming feature announced by Amazon at Gamescom will let you interact with Dead Island 2 using your voice. This feature is known as Alexa Game Control, and it pretty much does what it says on the tin. 


With Alexa Game Control in use, players will be able to control aspects of their game via Amazon&#x27;s voice activated software. Amazon states that the feature will work with &quot;any microphone or headset connected to their PC or console,&quot; and therefore &quot;players do not need an Echo device to play games with their voice&quot;. You will, however, need an Amazon account (but not necessarily a Prime one).


Along with this announcement, Amazon also revealed how this new feature will be implemented in Dambuster Studios&#x27; upcoming zombie slasher, Dead Island 2.

The PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) admission controller has been removed, as of
Kubernetes v1.25. Its deprecation was announced and detailed in the blog post
PodSecurityPolicy Deprecation: Past, Present, and Future,
published for the Kubernetes v1.21 release.
This article aims to provide historical context on the birth and evolution of
PSP, explain why the feature never made it to stable, and show why it was
removed and replaced by Pod Security admission control.
PodSecurityPolicy, like other specialized admission control plugins, provided
fine-grained permissions on specific fields concerning the pod security settings
as a built-in policy API. It acknowledged that cluster administrators and
cluster users are usually not the same people, and that creating workloads …</span>

Kubernetes 1.25: Combiner
The theme for Kubernetes v1.25 is Combiner.
The Kubernetes project itself is made up of many, many individual components that, when combined, take the form of the project you see today. It is also built and maintained by many individuals, all of them with different skills, experiences, histories, and interests, who join forces not just as the release team but as the many SIGs that support the project and the community year-round.

                              <span>After two games of terrifying deep sea survival, Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds is heading in a very different direction for its next project - a tabletop-inspired turn-based tactics game going by the name Moonbreaker, entering Steam early access on 29th September.


On a fundamental level, Moonbreaker, which has been in development for around five years, is surprisingly straightforward; each game sees players - either working against a human or AI opponent - strategising their way around a board, using careful positioning to their advantage as they work to annihilate the opposing player&#x27;s Captain.


So far so straightforward, but the complexity arrives when you begin factoring in the tactical options available to players during a match, including the likes of cover - which can either impenetrable or penetrable with an accuracy cost - plus Captains, crew members, ship assists, and resource management.

We got a first look at Atlas Fallen tonight during Gamescom Opening Night Live, via a flashy CGI trailer which shows off its sand-covered semi-open world and superpowered beasties.


Stick with the trailer - not that it isn&#x27;t easy on the eyes - and there&#x27;s a glimpse of what looks like actual gameplay right at the end.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima - the man behind the likes of Death Stranding, Metal Gear Solid, and PT - has once again popped up at the German Geoffs (AKA Gamescom Opening Night Live) for a bit of the old self-promotion, this time to announce a new podcast series known as Brain Structure.


Brain Structure, which will launch as a Spotify exclusive starting in September, appears to be seperate from Kojima&#x27;s Japan-only Radioverse podcast, which began in February and promised to bring listeners a variety of guests discussing &quot;deep topics related to games and movies that cannot be heard anywhere else&quot;.


This new Spotify podcast seems broadly similar in nature though, featuring appearances from &quot;very special guests from various fields&quot;, including, perhaps inevitably, Geoff Keighely, who&#x27;ll have his own regular entertainment news section.

Flashy footage from the game gave us our first proper look at Harley Quinn, who looks to be a major antagonist for Gotham Knights&#x27; four heroes, alongside Mr Freeze, Clayface and the Court of Owls.

                              <span>At Gamescom Opening Night Live, we were treated to a closer look at The Expanse: A Telltale Series. 


Along with this new teaser, which also comes with some behind the scenes chat with actress Cara Gee and the game&#x27;s development team and can be seen below, we now also have a release window - summer 2023.

The developers have said that this new game will be unlike any previous Telltale titles, thanks to the introduction of &quot;several new gameplay elements&quot;.

                              <span>Jeff Gardiner, a Bethesda veteran of 15 years and most recently the project lead on Fallout 76, has announced a new studio and open-world occult RPG with it.
The studio is Something Wicked Games and the project is Wyrdsong, pronounced &quot;weirdsong&quot;, or at least that&#x27;s how Gardiner pronounced it on a phone call to me. It&#x27;s going to be set in Portugal around the forming of the Knights Templar.
Something Wicked was co-founded with Obsidian veteran Charles Staples in April this year, who led design on Outer Worlds. And the studio is funded by NetEase courtesy of a $13.2m &quot;seed&quot; investment, which means it&#x27;s not all the money Something Wicked will need but a wadge to get going with.

A new story trailer for the game was shown at the Gamescom Opening Night Live, despite the release date leaking before the show.



And that trailer has it all: giant robots, cute companion robots, creepy young child robots, and the return of Amy Rose who appears to have been kidnapped. Check it out below.

                              <span>Funcom has released a first cinematic trailer for Dune: Awakening, a new &quot;open-world survival MMO&quot; inspired by Frank Herbert&#x27;s novels and Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s Academy Award-winning film, that&#x27;s heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.


Dune: Awakening was first teased back in 2019, when Funcom announced it had signed a deal with Legendary Studios to make &quot;at least&quot; three games set in Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune universe. One of those eventually turned out to be Dune: Spice Wars and the other, described as an &quot;open-world multiplayer game&quot; from Funcom Oslo, we can now call Dune: Awakening.


Today&#x27;s announcement doesn&#x27;t bring any gameplay, but Funcom says it&#x27;ll combine the &quot;grittiness and creativity of survival games with the social interactivity of large-scale, persistent multiplayer games&quot; in a &quot;vast and seamless Arrakis shared by thousands of players&quot;.

You can preorder the game now (it is listed for £19.49 on Steam) and in doing so get yourself some new horse armour for your piratical inventory.
Along with this news, delivered by Stan, of course, there was also tropical music a plenty, colourful set pieces, and a good dose of banter. You can see what you think for yourself below.

                              <span>Ahead of its release this December, we have been given another, gory, teaser for The Callisto Protocol. 


Debuted at Gamescom Opening Night Live, this new footage is as bloody and unpleasant as you would expect. There are mutations getting shoved into rotors, there is blood splattering the surfaces left, right and centre, and there are those kinds of noises that you do not want to ever hear when you are home alone at night (or any time for that matter). 


As well as the standard shooting and squelching, we also get to see some Tomb Raider-esque slipping and sliding down a water way. Of course, there are things to avoid, so this can only end well... See what you think to it all for yourself below.

                              <span>Following on from a leak earlier this month, Gearbox has officially unveiled its upcoming game, New Tales from the Borderlands. As we sort of already knew, it is coming on 21st October across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam and Epic).


This standalone, choice based, narrative is set in the &quot;perpetually war-torn Promethea&quot; and will see players deciding the fates of &quot;three underdogs out to make mayhem in their business&quot;. And what of these underdogs? Well, they are altruistic scientist Anu (pictured above), her ambitious &quot;streetwise&quot; brother Octavio, and the fierce, frogurt-flinging Fran.


You can see the trailer, which was shown during Gamescom Opening Night Live, for New Tales from the Borderlands below.

                              <span>Bungie has given Destiny 2&#x27;s long-awaited Lightfall expansion its first proper reveal, sharing a huge heap of gameplay details - from its Neptune setting to its new grapple-hook-like Strand ability - ahead of its now-confirmed launch date of 28th February next year.


Lightfall, which was initially announced back in June 2020, will be Destiny 2&#x27;s penultimate expansion, coming between this year&#x27;s The Witch Queen and the game&#x27;s finale expansion The Final Shape. As such, Bungie is calling it the &quot;beginning of the end&quot;, and it continues an escalating narrative that will bring Destiny&#x27;s Light and Darkness Saga to a close.


It finally gives a name and a face to Destiny 2&#x27;s much-teased big bad, The Witness, and will take players to Neptune&#x27;s capital city. This gleaming metropolis is, thanks to Calus&#x27; Shadow Legion, now Cabal-occupied territory, and players will need to deal with their new Pyramid-enhanced tech - including suppression devices, which can diminish Guardians&#x27; abilities - plus a new Pyramid unit known as the Tormentor.

While still formally unannounced by Sony, a Google Play listing for Ultimate Sackboy on Android is already visible - though curiously this dates back to June.

In a lengthy blog post, DICE has detailed how it will bring &quot;classes back to Battlefield&quot; by reintroducing the &quot;classic and familiar&quot; Assault, Recon, Support and Engineer as groups in which existing Specialists will sit as &quot;unique sub-classes&quot;.


Each of these classes will be tweaked to restrict gadget usage, enabling players to &quot;better assess the threat&quot;, and assign new class traits.

Previously, streamers who reach Partner status on the platform were tied to only livestreaming on Twitch.


Now Twitch Partners are also able to stream on rival platforms like YouTube and Facebook too, although simulcasting is not allowed there.

                              <span>Toshihiro Nagoshi has discussed the new project he&#x27;s working on and the reason for his departure from Sega.
Nagoshi, known as the father of the Super Monkey Ball and Yakuza series, left Sega in 2021 after 32 years at the company to join Chinese technology company NetEase. He later announced Nagoshi Studio, a subsidiary under NetEase Games, which would allow him to &quot;do something different&quot;.
In an interview with German gaming site 4Players, Nagoshi said it had not been creative differences that had led him to leave Sega, but that during his last few years at the company he was promoted to executive and management roles - something he wasn&#x27;t interested in.

Today&#x27;s launch of the Saints Row reboot has been seen as the first big test for Embracer&#x27;s AAA studio talent, following the company&#x27;s enormous and still-ongoing spree of acquisitions over the past couple of years. 


But yesterday&#x27;s Saints Row embargo lift was met with a lacklustre response from many outlets. Eurogamer&#x27;s own review stated the game &quot;won&#x27;t set the world alight&quot;, but noted that it still holds some &quot;pleasant surprises&quot;.

                              <span>It turns out Elden Ring character Goldmask does in fact have a voice line after all.


The character is a mere husk of a man with a golden mask on his face. He&#x27;s so enlightened he doesn&#x27;t ever speak and instead just points towards the towering Erdtree with a &quot;...&quot;.


Except, thanks to datamining, he does actually have a voice line hidden away in the Network Test version of the game.

Valve&#x27;s Lawrence Yang tweeted: &quot;Hi all, a few of you may have received an order email for your &#x27;Q4 window&#x27; Steam Deck reservation today. This wasn&#x27;t a mistake!

                              <span>Minecraft&#x27;s default player skin Steve has finally regrown its original beard, after 13 years.


Developer Mojang has updated the character designs for both Steve and Alex for the first time in over a decade. The changes add extra 3D elements to both of their blocky models - and return Steve&#x27;s OG face fuzz.


Steve&#x27;s beard was lost back in 2009, as part of a move to make Minecraft&#x27;s default skin more gender-neutral. It wasn&#x27;t until 2014 that the ponytailed Alex made an appearance.

                              <span>Another Monday, another Return to Monkey Island clip for us all to pore over.


The latest clip from creator Ron Gilbert shows the game&#x27;s new streamlined UI, with prompts appearing on-screen as hero Guybrush Threepwood explores the Scumm Bar on Melee Island.


When the cursor moves across the screen in this clip, messages such as &quot;Time to talk to the pirate leaders&quot; and &quot;Smells good in there&quot; pop up. The interactions shown do not appear intrusive, and seem to offer a clever way of keeping the story moving along.

And that includes the formidable Malenia.

The project will adapt one of the best early Tintin comic books, from a time when the young reporter (and Snowy the dog) were not yet accompanied by sidekick Captain Haddock. 


The project - developed by Madrid-based adventure game maker Pendulo Studios, and published by French company Microids - was first mentioned by Microids back in April 2020, before all went quiet. We&#x27;ve been waiting to hear more ever since. Now, here&#x27;s a teaser trailer:

Plazas and Promenades - the 11th major expansion for developer Colossal Order&#x27;s acclaimed city builder - brings a new pedestrianisation focus to the game, giving budding urban planners the tools needed to add pedestrian-only streets, pedestrian zones, and zone-specific policies.


The latter include the likes of Slow Driving (which implements a 20mph speed limit for all non-highway roads within a pedestrian zone), Sugar Ban (which increases citizen lifespan at the expense of happiness), and Music (increasing happiness but also increasing noise pollution).

The reports were sparked by photos - originally posted to Instagram back in July - that showed actors in Ubisoft-branded mo-cap suits apparently working on a Marvel project.


The images resurfaced yesterday thanks to YouTuber and regular Ubisoft leaker JorRaptor, who pointed out a clapperboard which listed director Bassam Tariq - who is also directing Marvel&#x27;s 2023 Blade reboot.

Sorrenti posted a video after the event describing how she was &quot;terrorised&quot; by police when they arrived at her home with assault rifles.


She&#x27;s since moved to a hotel but has now been doxxed by a transphobic hate group known as Kiwi Farms.

As noted by The Verge, WordleBot now lists &#x27;Slate&#x27; as the optimal starting word. 


Previously, &#x27;Crane&#x27; was the New York Times&#x27; favourite starting suggestion, however this has been given the boot in favour of the &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;T&#x27; inclusive &#x27;Slate&#x27;. This makes sense, as &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;T&#x27; are two of the most commonly occurring letters throughout our dictionary.

                              <span>Over the weekend, we got a look at a brand new Pokémon. 
This new addition is Cyclizar, and it was featured as part of a new trailer for the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, shown during the closing ceremony of this year&#x27;s Pokémon World Championships. 
The trailer, which you can watch below, shows Cyclizar with motorbike-esque appendages that are very similar to fellow bipedal reptile-like legendary Koraidon. It also shows off a new move called &quot;Shed Tail&quot;, which allows players to create a substitute and then &quot;swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting&quot;.

This could mean rebates for those who avoid using consumer goods such as computers and games consoles between the hours of 5pm and 8pm each evening, BBC News wrote.


The scheme is reportedly being planned by the National Grid electricity system operator (ESO) for those with smart meters, with full details to be set out in the next two weeks after consultation with energy companies and UK regulator Ofgem.

                              <span>A developer from the original Grand Theft Auto game has reportedly had prototype videos hit with a copyright strike from Rockstar Games.


Mike Dailly, one of the founders of DMA Design (now Rockstar North), has tweeted he&#x27;s removed any GTA videos due to the strikes.


&quot;I see Rockstar are going full fuckers mode again, issuing copyright strikes to any GTA video they can find - including both my prototype videos. So now they&#x27;re trying to block all release of anyone&#x27;s work on a game - and any old development footage,&quot; he tweeted yesterday.

                              <span>We now have our first look at HBO&#x27;s upcoming adaptation of The Last of Us.


Shared as part of a collection of teasers for the service&#x27;s new season, this clip was brief but enticing. It comes with the obligatory dramatic music as it shows us snippets of Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel running through the streets with someone who I won&#x27;t name to avoid spoilers, Bella Ramsay as Ellie and Nick Offerman as Bill. While we don&#x27;t see any of the series&#x27; infected enemies, we do get a brief snap of some fungal like spores on a wall, hinting at the devastation the world is in. 


The entire HBO clip, which can be seen below, also gives us small teasers for shows such as The Idol, Doom Patrol and Pennyworth. However, if you want to jump straight to The Last of Us, that begins at around the 1:43 mark.

A developer says it was possible to run their own software on the car infotainment hardware after discovering the vehicle’s manufacturer had secured its system using keys that were not only publicly known but had been lifted from programming examples.

“Turns out the [AES] encryption key in that script is the first AES 128-bit CBC example key listed in the NIST document SP800-38A [PDF]”.

Luck held out, in a way. “Greenluigi1” found within the firmware image the RSA public key used by the updater, and searched online for a portion of that key. The search results pointed to a common public key that shows up in online tutorials like “...</span>

Since the very beginning of Kubernetes, the topic of persistent data and how to address the requirement of stateful applications has been an important topic. Support for stateless deployments was natural, present from the start, and garnered attention, becoming very well-known. Work on better support for stateful applications was also present from early on, with each release increasing the scope of what could be run on Kubernetes.
Message queues, databases, clustered filesystems: these are some examples of the solutions that have different storage requirements and that are, today, increasingly deployed in Kubernetes. Dealing with ephemeral and persistent storage, local or remote, file or block, from many different vendors, while considering how to provide the …</span>

                              <span>MultiVersus has knocked Elden Ring off the top spot of the month&#x27;s best-selling games.

NPD Group reports (thanks, NME) that despite being free-to-play - albeit with in-game purchases - MultiVersus is the highest-grossing game of July 2022, due in part to its Founder Packs promotion. 

It may not sound like a particularly impressive feat but to put it into perspective, since its release in February, Elden Ring has been the best-selling game every month but one.

The video also showcases how the team worked alongside the BWT Alpine F1 Team to capture a real F1 pit stop, which you will see &quot;brought to life in the game&quot;.

It&#x27;s a fascinating glimpse into how games are made, and the lengths developers go to to try and create an authentic sim experience. Check it out below:

                              <span>It looks like Ubisoft+ - Ubisoft&#x27;s own game subscription service - may finally be on the way to Xbox.

Up until now, Ubisoft+ has only been available to players on PC, but a service that scrapes Xbox&#x27;s backend and spotted by our friends at VGC has reportedly found an Ubisoft+ logo in the system, hinting that Ubisoft+ may be coming soon.

A prior announcement confirmed that Ubisoft+ - unlike EA Play - would not be part of Xbox Game Pass, and this is unlikely to have changed, particularly as a cut-down version of the Ubisoft sub, Ubisoft+ Classics, is available within the upper tiers of Sony&#x27;s rival PS Plus. We&#x27;ll have to wait until we get a formal announcement to confirm that either way, though.

                              <span>Ubisoft has pulled back the curtain to give a sneaky peek at what&#x27;s to come in Rainbow Six Siege&#x27;s next update, Operation Brutal Swarm.

Though details are light - more will be revealed in an upcoming livestream set for 21st August - we do learn more about new a 1 Health and 3 Speed Attacker Grim, a Singaporean with one goal: &quot;to get the job done&quot;.

&quot;Grim&#x27;s experience in the EOD taught him how easily things can blow up when a target&#x27;s position and proximity is unknown,&quot; Ubisoft teases in a blog update. &quot;That&#x27;s where the Kawan Hive Launcher comes in, with no reload and a low fire rate the launcher allows for versatile gameplay, using Intel-Gathering and Area Denial to counter roamers, make entry, and protect objectives.

                              <span>Sega is giving two more of its classic titles the movie treatment: Space Channel 5 and Comix Zone.

No doubt inspired by the runaway success of the Sonic movies, Sega looks set to adapt the two games alongside Picturestart, which is also working on the upcoming Borderlands movie (which is seemingly now in post-production).

Dance game Space Channel 5 will be retitled Channel 5 and, according to Hollywood Reporter, &quot;tell the story of a hapless fast-food worker who is recruited by a freedom reporter from the future to save the world from aliens using the one thing that unites all people on the planet: our love of silly viral dances&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to a new job advertisement put out by the company that seeks a new senior software engineer with &quot;experience with game development&quot;.

As well as finding someone with all the necessary coding skills, Netflix hopes the new recruit will also have some experience in &quot;Unity or Unreal game engines&quot; and says it is &quot;rapidly expanding new gaming offerings&quot; on its global streaming service.

&quot;An NPC by which players may voluntarily return the deposit they were accidentally refunded has been added,&quot; the update states, above an image of three cute apology posters starring Namazu and Lalafell.

                              <span>The jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus gigas) uses its color-changing ability as a language:
In 2020, however, marine biologists discovered that jumbo flying squid are surprisingly coordinated. Despite their large numbers, the squid rarely bumped into each other or competed for the same prey. The scientists hypothesized that the flickering pigments allowed the squid to quickly communicate complex messages, such as when it was preparing to attack and what it was targeting.
The researchers observed that the squid displayed 12 distinct pigmentation patterns in a variety of sequences, similar to how humans arrange words in a sentence. For example, squid darkened while pursuing prey and then shifted to a half light/half dark pattern immediately before striking. The researchers hypothesized that these whole-body pigment changes signaled a precise action, such as “I’m about to attack.”...</span>

                              <span>The USB Rubber Ducky is getting better and better.
Already, previous versions of the Rubber Ducky could carry out attacks like creating a fake Windows pop-up box to harvest a user’s login credentials or causing Chrome to send all saved passwords to an attacker’s webserver. But these attacks had to be carefully crafted for specific operating systems and software versions and lacked the flexibility to work across platforms.
The newest Rubber Ducky aims to overcome these limitations. It ships with a major upgrade to the DuckyScript programming language, which is used to create the commands that the Rubber Ducky will enter into a target machine. While previous versions were mostly limited to writing keystroke sequences, DuckyScript 3.0 is a feature-rich language, letting users write functions, store variables, and use logic flow controls (i.e., if this… then that)...</span>

The Kubernetes project has participants from all around the globe. Some are friends, some are colleagues, and some are strangers. The one thing that unifies them, no matter their differences, are that they all have an interesting story. It is my pleasure to be the documentarian for the stories of the Kubernetes community in the weekly Kubernetes Podcast from Google. With every new Kubernetes release comes an interview with the release team lead, telling the story of that release, but also their own personal story.
With 1.25 around the corner, the tradition continues with a look back at the story of 1.24. That release was led by James Laverack of Jetstack. James was on the podcast in May, and while you can read his story below, if you can, please do listen to it i…</span>

                              <span>This vulnerability was reported to Zoom last December:
The exploit works by targeting the installer for the Zoom application, which needs to run with special user permissions in order to install or remove the main Zoom application from a computer. Though the installer requires a user to enter their password on first adding the application to the system, Wardle found that an auto-update function then continually ran in the background with superuser privileges.
When Zoom issued an update, the updater function would install the new package after checking that it had been cryptographically signed by Zoom. But a bug in how the checking method was implemented meant that giving the updater any file with the same name as Zoom’s signing certificate would be enough to pass the test—so an attacker could substitute any kind of malware program and have it be run by the updater with elevated privilege...</span>

                              <span>This is more of a demonstration than a real-world vulnerability, but researchers can use electromagnetic interference to remotely control touchscreens.
From a news article:
It’s important to note that the attack has a few key limitations. Firstly, the hackers need to know the target’s phone passcode, or launch the attack while the phone is unlocked. Secondly, the victim needs to put the phone face down, otherwise the battery and motherboard will block the electromagnetic signal. Thirdly, the antenna array has to be no more than four centimeters (around 1.5 inches) away. For all these reasons the researchers themselves admit that the “invisible finger” technique is a proof of concept that at this point is far from being a threat outside of a university lab.  ...</span>

                              <span>Scammers were able to convince YouTube that other peoples’ music was their own. They successfully stole $23 million before they were caught.
No one knows how common this scam is, and how much money total is being stolen in this way. Presumably this is not an uncommon fraud.
While the size of the heist and the breadth of the scheme may be very unique, it’s certainly a situation that many YouTube content creators have faced before. YouTube’s Content ID system, meant to help creators, has been weaponized by bad faith actors in order to make money off content that isn’t theirs. While some false claims are just mistakes caused by automated systems, the MediaMuv case is a perfect example of how fraudsters are also purposefully taking advantage of digital copyright rules...</span>
