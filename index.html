                              <span>Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone recently shared a selection of very early sketches and ideas that eventually led to the creation of fan-favourite farming sim, Stardew Valley.

They include notes and annotations handwritten by Barone that intimate how he expected players to interact with the different characters and items in the game.

&quot;[I] was going through some things and found my old notebook with the original community centre concept,&quot; Barone tweeted, before sharing wonderful sketches taken from his original notebook.

The &quot;all-new&quot; Veiled Collection Event for Apex Legends: Revelry – which goes live on 25th April and runs until 9th May – not only introduces the requisite new cosmetic skin collection, but also a new limited-time team deathmatch mode Unshielded Deadeye, where &quot;Legends wield limited rotating loadouts&quot;. 

As the &quot;unshielded&quot; name suggests, players forego both helmets or shields and race to become the first to clock up 50 kills and &quot;prove themselves a Champion among Legends&quot;.

&quot;There’s been so much happening in the world of Wild Hearts recently,&quot; the team explains. &quot;We deployed a PC crash hotfix and a Claw Blade &amp; Bow Rebalance patch last week. So much to share and we haven’t even gotten to what&#x27;s in today&#x27;s content update!&quot;

&quot;Deathhaze Gloombeak soars into Akikure Canyon, along with a new title and a new talisman skill for those able to reach new heights as a hunter. Serial Hunts – a new kind of Special Quest – have also been added, and could very well be the most arduous challenge Azuma’s hunters have seen to date.&quot;

                              <span>Four more Ubisoft games are slated to join Steam later this year.

Far Cry 6, Riders Republic, Rainbow Six Extraction, and Monopoly Madness are set to come to the Steam store on 11th May, 8th June, 15th June, and 22nd June, respectively, marking the first time these titles will be playable on Steam.

Since 2019, Ubisoft had skipped bringing its game to Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12 per cent revenue cut compared to Valve&#x27;s 30 per cent.

The smash-hit indie horror hit – which offers some genuinely unsettling moments in its 10ish hour run time over numerous playthroughs – doesn&#x27;t seem to boast any Switch-specific features, but it does mark the first time the chilling creeper is available outside of Steam.

&quot;Having completed your degree in mortuary sciences, you have taken on an apprenticeship at River Fields Mortuary. Over the past several months you have logged many hours aiding the Mortician in daily tasks along with learning the ins and outs of the embalming process as well as how to properly handle and care for the deceased,&quot; teases the description on the Nintendo Shop.

All this comes via Sons of the Forest&#x27;s patch #4, which, while fairly light on radical new features, brings a host of welcome quality of life improvements - including the aforementioned Kelvin buff meaning he can now carry a whopping two logs at once - plus tweaks, and more. 


There&#x27;s some new stuff on the feature front, though, including a new Action Cam used to view Sons of the Forest&#x27;s found footage tapes - the first of which is now in-game - plus new points of interest discovery laptops, and the ability to name save games.

                              <span>Developers Massive Monster&#x27;s entertaining dungeon-crawling management sim Cult of the Lamb is getting a massive free update next Monday, 24th April, introducing a new post-game storylie, &quot;deeper&quot; combat, new building options, and more.


There&#x27;s a lot going on in Relics of the Old Faith, as the update is known, starting with the introduction of Relics and heavy attacks as part of Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s improved combat. It also adds remixed dungeons featuring revamped enemies and bosses, including new versions of the base game&#x27;s four Guardian Bishops as confirmed during Nintendo&#x27;s indie showcase.


Away from the dungeon-crawling side of things, Massive Monster says the game&#x27;s cult management portion will get new followers, plus a range of new buildings - including a kitchen with its own chef for more efficient cooking, a (non-collapsing) shared shelter capable of housing up to three followers, a crypt to keep graveyard sizes under control, plus farm plot signs which followers can plant stuff around for better crop organisation.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced Victoria 3&#x27;s first paid expansion, a new &quot;immersion pack&quot; titled Voice of the People, which launches on 22nd May.


Voice of the People&#x27;s main new feature is introduction of ideological &quot;agitators&quot; from across history, including Victor Hugo and Karl Marx. Agitators are a new kind of character in Victoria 3, capable of rallying pops to support political movements that align with their ideology.


&quot;Agitators will shake up your internal politics, acting independently of their Interest Groups,&quot; Paradox explains in a blog post accompanying its DLC announcement. &quot;Amplifying power from below, Agitators serve an opposite function to Interest Group Petitions which reflect the demands of the political elite. Depending on how your goals align with theirs, Agitators might be a painful thorn in your side or a valuable ally to your political agenda.&quot;

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s Aaron Greenberg has insisted Tango Gameworks&#x27; Hi-Fi Rush was a &quot;break out hit&quot; amid claims the critically acclaimed music adventure &quot;just didn&#x27;t make the money it needed to make&quot;.


The claim Hi-Fi Rush had failed to meet Microsoft&#x27;s financial expectations was made by Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb during his latest Game Mess Decides podcast.

&quot;Based on what I&#x27;ve heard,&quot; Grubb said during a conversation about the game&#x27;s release strategy, &quot;it just straight up didn&#x27;t make the money it needed to make. I mean it got good reviews, the buzz was good, so where do you put the blame for something like that? Is it the price? Was it the shadow drop? Could it have sold more? Or is it Game Pass?&quot;.

                              <span>Darker and Darker&#x27;s lawyer has accused Korean gaming company Nexon of &quot;anti-competitive bully tactics&quot;, in a letter to Steam owner Valve. 


Following positive reception at Steam Next Fest earlier this year, Dark and Darker has experienced a troubled production. In March, developer Ironmace had its office searched, after Nexon alleged the studio created its game with code stolen from Nexon&#x27;s own &quot;P3&quot; project (something several members of Ironmace&#x27;s team had previously worked on). 


Soon after these allegations were made, Nexon issued Ironmace with a cease and desist demand, and Dark and Darker was removed from Steam. Most recently, it came to light that the Dark and Darker developer is being sued by Nexon for &quot;copyright infringement&quot;, with the Korean game publisher demanding a jury trial in America.

&quot;It seems like a few of them really love the Nazis outside of the game too,&quot; Newman continued.

Earlier this week, World of Warcraft producer Adam &quot;Glaxigrav&quot; took to Twitter to voice opinions on how Blizzard is &quot;losing amazing talent because someone in power doesn&#x27;t listen to the game directors who make his products&quot;.


He added: &quot;DE&amp;I [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] also means diversity of thought, especially when it&#x27;s backed by data and financials&quot;.

                              <span>Valve has released a significant update to its MOBA Dota 2, called New Frontiers.


It expands the map and makes meaningful gameplay, matchmaking and user interface changes, among many other things.

While the core objectives of the game are the same, with lanes the same distance from each other and win objectives still in the centre of the map, there&#x27;s 40 percent more terrain, which means there&#x27;s loads of room to gather resources.

Specifically, Atari&#x27;s new acquisitions span the PC and console game catalogues of publishers Micropose, Infogrames, Accolade, with Atari also now owning the Accolade trademark.


Sadly, the company hasn&#x27;t shared a full list of the retro IP it now owns after its most recent splurge, so there&#x27;ll be no time for lengthy bouts of nostalgia here - but its announcement did at least call out the aforementioned Bubsy and Demolition Racer, alongside Hardball, 1942: Pacific Air War, F-117A, and F-14 air combat series.

Firewalk was founded in 2018 as a subsidiary of ProbablyMonsters and is yet to release its first game. However, the studio announced a partnership with Sony in 2021 to create a new PlayStation-exclusive triple-A title focused on delivering &quot;memorable multiplayer moments&quot;.


In a PlayStation Blog post announcing the acquisition, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst explained it was Firewalk&#x27;s work on its still mysterious title - a project being headed by former Destiny creative director Ryan Ellis - that lead Sony to acquire the developer.

                              <span>Dazzlingly chaotic crowd puzzler Humanity, which is being developed by Tokyo game studio THA in collaboration Tetris Effect developer Enhance, will be tumbling onto PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC on 16th May, and it&#x27;ll be a day one PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue addition too.


Humanity, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, has been in development for a fair old while, with THA first showcasing the game back in 2017 before it re-emerged two years later with Enhance attached. It&#x27;s remained an intriguing proposition throughout its journey, challenging players - in the role of a Shiba Inu - to corral huge, purposeless crowds.


There&#x27;s a vague air of classic puzzler Lemmings about the whole thing as players let out a &quot;woof&quot; to control Humanity&#x27;s vast swarms, making the crowds move, change direction, jump, float, or even fight in order to navigate Trials packed with traps and obstacles, and overcome enemies known as the Others.

Originally announced in May 2021, Heartland has now been in closed testing for over a year already - but there&#x27;s evidently still more to be done before it gets a final launch date. 


Tonight, Ubisoft directed interested players and their parties to register for access (at thedivisionheartland.com) in a fresh round of testing, ahead of &quot;more news this summer&quot;.

As originally reported by The Washington Post, today&#x27;s layoffs could affect as many as 4,000 employees at Meta, and are part of the company&#x27;s stated goal of cutting a further 10,000 jobs in 2023 following the 11,000 job losses announced last year.


The Washington Post claims Meta has targeted &quot;highly skilled staff&quot; - including engineers and other technical workers - in its latest round of layoffs, and, since its report, employees have said both Ready at Dawn and fellow Meta acquisition Downpour Interactive have been impacted.

Apple introduced the optional recovery key in 2020 to protect users from online hackers. Users who turn on the recovery key, a unique 28-digit code, must provide it when they want to reset their Apple ID password.
iPhone thieves with your passcode can flip on the recovery key and lock you out. And if you already have the recovery key enabled, they can easily generate a new one, which also locks you out.
Apple’s policy gives users virtually no way back into their accounts without that recovery key. For now, a stolen iPhone could mean devastating personal losses...</span>

Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature called Node log query that allows
viewing logs of services running on the node.
What problem does it solve?
Cluster administrators face issues when debugging malfunctioning services
running on the node. They usually have to SSH or RDP into the node to view the
logs of the service to debug the issue. The Node log query feature helps with
this scenario by allowing the cluster administrator to view the logs using
kubectl. This is especially useful with Windows nodes where you run into the
issue of the node going to the ready state but containers not coming up due to
CNI misconfigurations and other issues that are not easily identifiable by
looking at the Pod status.

                              <span>Spooky visual novel Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is steeped in Japanese history. When you&#x27;re not absorbing the sights of 1980s Tokyo or hearing ancient folk tales, Paranormasight feeds you bits of information about Japan during the wider Shōwa era and the earlier Edo period.


Whether from decades or centuries ago, elements of Japanese history are woven into the game, something which Paranormasight director and writer Takaya Ishiyama told me more about, in a discussion which revealed more about the team&#x27;s approach to using history in the game&#x27;s narrative as a way to balance realism and mystery.


One of the first things you notice when playing Paranormasight is the difference in visual style between the environments and the characters. The game&#x27;s cast were drawn by Kobayashi Gen, and his distinct style stands out from the surroundings in-game. The 360-degree panoramas you explore were all created from photographs, though this wasn&#x27;t initially what the team set out to do.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast it&#x27;s all about Zelda, and the many burning questions we still have surrounding the upcoming Tears of the Kingdom. 

Despite all the details to be found in Nintendo&#x27;s final Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, there&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know.  How much has changed in Hyrule since Breath of the Wild, and how many new areas are there to explore? Are there proper dungeons in the game this time around? What are the Tears of the Kingdom? 
With less than a month until launch, it&#x27;s time for one final round of theorising - as the internet begins to entertain some wild theories that Ganon is actually good, or maybe just pulling a Thanos. Joining me to discuss it all - and place bets on whether Zelda really is playable - are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Activision issued an update to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Warzone 2.0 and DMZ overnight that includes an interesting gameplay change the community reckons is a response to a backlash over pay-to-win bundles.


Last week, Season 3 of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 went live alongside a bundle that includes controversial &quot;bonus effects&quot; for the extraction mode, DMZ.

For example, the Classic Ghost Pack, which costs 2400 CP, includes a free two-plate armour vest, a 15-minute insured weapon cooldown for each of the two guns included in the bundle, and adds one more active duty operator slot for DMZ.

                              <span>Cast your minds back to October last year and you may recall footage doing the rounds of a self-proclaimed &quot;body cam-style&quot; game that looked almost too realistic to actually be real - if you know what I mean.


However, fast forward six months and we now have an official trailer for the game. It&#x27;s called Unrecord, and comes from a developer known simply as Drama.


Unrecord is described as a &quot;single-player FPS that tells the story of a tactical police officer from the perspective of his body camera&quot;. You can see how it looks for yourself below - and its realism makes for slightly uncomfortable viewing.

For the first time, high quality scans of the artwork are being shared with the Pokémon community in the hopes of archiving them.

The drawings depict the first 251 Pokémon to appear in the games and were uploaded by YouTuber and Pokémon archivist LewTwo to Twitter. The scans were sent to Lewtwo by Twitter user ExcaliburZero_Z.

The old scans are believed to have originated from the Pokémon Red and Blue Player&#x27;s Guide, Lewtwo explained, where they ended up with &quot;inaccurate colors, were often misshapen, and generally very low quality&quot;.

                              <span>Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores only released yesterday, but many players have already completed the DLC, and one particular moment during its ending has evoked a strong reaction from some fans. 


Please note, there are spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


During the events of Burning Shores, Aloy meets Seyka, an &quot;ambitious marine of the Quen tribe who has stepped up to help her people survive&quot;. Ahead of the DLC&#x27;s release, Seyka was touted as a character that would be Aloy&#x27;s equal, with actress Ashley Birch even saying &quot;Aloy may have met her match&quot;.

                              <span>Bungie is adding new accessibility options to Destiny 2, specifically for colour blindness.


Season of the Deep, out 23rd May, will include an option for players to amend the Enemy Targeted Reticle Colour that changes when aiming at an enemy, as well as new colour options for subtitles to ensure they&#x27;re easy to read.


Bungie is also adding colour presets for Commendations, meaning players with colour blindness can still clearly see rewards.

Today brings the long-awaited free release of Grass-type Mythical Pokémon Shaymin - for those who didn&#x27;t cough up for a paid Go Fest ticket last summer.


Sparking up players&#x27; attention is the title of this event&#x27;s new Special Research questline - &quot;Grass and Gratitude&quot; - which is available now alongside the game&#x27;s similarly grass-themed Sustainability Week.

Cathcart is known for voicing Professor Oak and his grandson Gary, as well as Team Rocket&#x27;s James and Meowth, since the first episode of Pokémon the Series. His other credits include providing the voice of Vector the Crocodile in 2005&#x27;s Shadow the Hedgehog.


In a blog post earlier this week, Cathcart&#x27;s wife Martha made the announcement after revealing Cathcart&#x27;s tumours weren&#x27;t responding to initial chemotherapy &quot;as much as was anticipated&quot;.

                              <span>A Mario character who appears in the new Super Mario Bros. Movie will be re-named in Japan, Nintendo has confirmed. 


Mario and Luigi&#x27;s former boss Spike appears in the film as a stern foreman and rival for the brothers&#x27; new firm. The character is a deep cut from Mario canon, and originally appeared in the NES and arcade game Wrecking Crew back in the 1980s.


In Japan, Spike has always had the name &quot;Blackie&quot; - which for obvious reasons will no longer be used. Henceforth, the character will be re-named as &quot;Spike&quot; in any future appearances, and the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie will use &quot;Spike&quot; as well.

                              <span>Blizzard has teased a new Diablo 4 beta ahead of the action role-playing game&#x27;s 6th June launch.


Quote tweeting a Twitter user&#x27;s call for more Diablo 4 game time, the official Diablo Twitter account said: &quot;That can be arranged…&quot;


That&#x27;s a pretty clear tease that some surprise way to play Diablo 4 ahead of release is planned. Whether that&#x27;s a fresh open beta or early access remains to be seen. If you pre-order Diablo 4 you currently get early access from 2nd June, so this tweet suggests something even earlier.

                              <span>Epic Games has gripped another studio in a permanent money hug, this time acquiring Horizon Chase Turbo developer Aquiris to work on Fortnite.


The Brazil-based Aquiris was founded in 2007 and went on to develop the well-received Wonderbox: The Adventure Maker and Looney Tunes World of Mayhem for mobile, as well as its retro-inspired arcade racer Horizon Chase which released in 2015.


A much-expanded - and critically acclaimed - follow-up, Horizon Chase Turbo, arrived in 2018, whisking the series from mobile to PC and consoles, and Aquiris launched a third entry in the series, Horizon Chase 2, on Apple Arcade at the end of last year.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been quite some time since The Game Kitchen announced it was working on a sequel to its gorgeous, gothic action-platformer Blasphemous, but now - with a release pencilled in for &quot;late summer&quot; 2023 - we&#x27;ve been given a first trailer for Blasphemous 2.


The original Blasphemous released back in 2019 to well-deserved acclaim, delivering a rock-solid 2D Metroidvania-meets-Souls-like that married a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling baroque imagery.


In its upcoming sequel, Blasphemous&#x27; original pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One returns for another adventure - tying into the first game&#x27;s Wounds of Eventide update ending - set across a strange new labyrinthine land ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

                              <span>Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, the long-awaited follow-up to developer Night School Studio&#x27;s acclaimed supernatural adventure Oxenfree, finally has a release date, and is launching for Switch, PlayStaton, PC, and mobile on 12th July.


Announced back in 2021 and initially expected to launch that same year, Oxenfree 2 is set five years after the memorable, dimension-shattering events of the original game. This time around, the story focuses on new protagonist Riley Poverly, an environmental researcher who returns to her small coastal hometown of Camena which, as you might already have guessed, is being plagued by mysterious radio signals.


Making matters worse, there&#x27;s a cult on the loose, attempting to open a portal between worlds, but Riley has some useful new tricks to help her investigations. A new walkie talkie, for instance, means communiucation can occur between characters all across Camena even when they&#x27;re not together, with conversation and dialogue choices affecting how events play out.

One interesting bit is that Apple’s Lockdown Mode (part of iOS 16) seems to have worked to prevent infection.

With the release of Kubernetes v1.27 the ReadWriteOncePod feature has graduated
to beta. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll take a closer look at this feature, what it
does, and how it has evolved in the beta release.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is a new access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.

                              <span>The Day Before developer Fntastic has re-emerged with news of a beta test for its highly-anticipated but held-up zombie MMO, ahead of a full release on 10th November. 


As a reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release in March, before its launch was delayed. In a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game&#x27;s name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam and since then, very little has been heard at all.


The Day Before has now reemerged, however, with word from an administrator on the game&#x27;s official Discord that a beta is now in the pipeline.

Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Title Update 5 (also referred to as Version 15) launches tomorrow, 20th April, and its flagship new arrival is the Looming Calamity, better known as the elder dragon Amatsu. This formidable creature can control the weather, conjuring violent storms and lightning strikes once it shows its true power, and is available to hunters at MR 10 or higher.


Amatsu is accompanied by Title Update 5&#x27;s second creature addition, a powerful Risen variant Shagaru Magala, which becomes available at MR 180 or higher. As you&#x27;d expect, new equipment can be forged from the materials dropped by both creatures, including a fetching bit of Palamute outfit resembling floating armoured horse.

                              <span>A Pokémon fan has created an impressive HD-2D take on the series&#x27; original Game Boy games.


Several videos made by 3D pixel artist and designer Dott have surfaced in the past week, showing off what Pokémon Red might look like if reimagined in an HD-2D style similar to recent Square Enix titles like Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler. 


It&#x27;s a design which has sparked excitement from fans at how future Pokémon remakes could be made, after the rather lacklustre response to 2021&#x27;s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and more general gripes about the series&#x27; visuals in all-new entries.

So, here are some of the current Tears of the Kingdom theories out there. (Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.)

Thalassophobia is classed as the persistent and intense fear of deep bodies of water, including the sea, oceans and even lakes. It is different from aquaphobia, which is a fear of water itself.


According to Guerrilla, this option aims to ease a player&#x27;s thalassophobia by &quot;improving underwater ambient visibility&quot;. Additionally, Aloy will be able to breathe indefinitely when under the water &quot;regardless of story progression&quot;.

The exuberant Jack Black ballad, in character as Bowser, is a highight of the film, and the catchiest movie track since Encanto&#x27;s Bruno. I even heard it being chanted by the younger viewers around me as I left the cinema. 


It&#x27;s also now hit the US song charts as well, and has marked Black&#x27;s first solo entry in the Billboard Hot 100. On YouTube, meanwhile, the song&#x27;s music video has racked up 17m views in 11 days. Let&#x27;s watch:

Ubisoft has issued a raft of updates to the beta in a bid to improve the experience. My own time with the game on PlayStation 5 has been beset with technical issues that have forced me to restart in order to get a match. Ubisoft reacted to progression problems by unlocking everything for all players.

                              <span>Today brings a set of four more Sega Genesis games for the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service - and more specifically, it&#x27;s pricier Expansion Pack tier.


Capcom classic Street Fighter 2: Special Champion Edition leads the bunch, alongside Sega sidescroller Kid Chameleon. 


Sci-fi sidescroller Pulseman, an early project from Pokémon developer Game Freak, is also now available to try. It&#x27;s set in the &quot;far future of 2015&quot;, which I&#x27;d like to go back to.

                              <span>Crank-based portable gaming curio Playdate has now sold over 53,000 units - more than twice the number its creator Panic had originally forecast.


Playdate was initially announced back in 2019, promising a unique (and dinkily adorable) spin on portable gaming that would see Panic teaming up with a host of noted indie game designers - including the likes of Zach Gage and Bennett Foddy - to produce a curated 24-game &quot;season&quot;, as well as offering itch.io sideloading support and, more recently, an on-device store.


It was a pitch that clearly captured peoples&#x27; imaginations; Panic has now revealed the initial 20,000 Playdate units it produced based on its early sales predictions sold out within 20 minutes of the device being made available to purchase via a queue system last April.

Proceedings are set to commence at 7pm BST/8pm CEST/11am PDT this Thursday via Twitch and YouTube, with Ubisoft promising news on three of its The Division games.


Up first is the still-popular The Division 2, which will share more on its upcoming rogue-like-inspired Descent mode, alongside details of its Year 5 plans. Ubisoft, you might recall, confirmed a fifth year of content would be happening last July.

The problem
On Linux with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled, it&#x27;s traditionally
the container runtime that applies SELinux labels to a Pod and all its volumes.
Kubernetes only passes the SELinux label from a Pod&#x27;s securityContext fields
to the container runtime.
The container runtime then recursively changes SELinux label on all files that
are visible to the Pod&#x27;s containers. This can be time-consuming if there are
many files on the volume, especially when the volume is on a remote filesystem.
Note
subPath of a volume, only that subPath of the whole
volume is relabeled. This allows two pods that have two different SELinux labels
to use the same volume, as long as they use different subpaths of it.

If a Pod does not have any SELinux label assigned in …</span>

                              <span>The two opposing forces of light and dark smash merrily together later this week as The Sims 4 turns its attention to extravagant greenhouse suntraps and grungy, dingy basements in two new Kit DLC packs, both arriving 20th April.


With spring now in full swing, green-fingered sorts will have the seasonally appropriate opporunity to fashion their own horticultural hangouts as part of The Sims 4&#x27;s new Greenhouse Haven Kit. This introduces glass pane windows and doors that can be connected to create new garden spaces, as well as a range of items to go inside - including hanging baskets, starter seedlings, a planting table, and range of pots.


Alternatively, for those who&#x27;d prefer to hide away from the sun&#x27;s rays in grungy comfort, there&#x27;s the Basement Treasures Kit, offering a selection of hand-me-down inspired furnishings. Expect the likes of worn and torn chairs and couches, crates of vinyl records, old trophies and family photos, battered chests, and  even an old cathode-ray tube TV.

                              <span>Six to Start and Marvel have announced Marvel Move, an upcoming fitness adventure app that will see heroes such as Thor, Wolverine and Hulk offering encouraging words as users endeavour to run through an interactive story or two.


Now, by run, I mean actual running. One foot in front of the other and all that. And to add that extra layer of adventure and excitement, the app &#x27;gamifies&#x27; your run by popping Marvel&#x27;s heroes in your ear as they join you via the app&#x27;s interactive stories. That said, you can also walk or jog (or perhaps even trot) your way through the storylines if you prefer.  


You can see a little trailer for Marvel Move below:

                              <span>Microsoft has announced the next wave of new Xbox and PC Game Pass games.


From today, players will be able to get their hands on Minecraft Legends - &quot;The piglins are threatening to consume the Overworld. Are you the hero this gentle land needs?&quot; Microsoft asks. 


In her Minecraft Legends review, Caelyn Ellis said that while the series&#x27; iconic &quot;blocky charm is present and correct&quot;, she felt that the rest of the game was &quot;only as deep as the skins it wants to sell you&quot;. She did, however, like the piglins.

Indie World details upcoming Nintendo Switch games from indie developers, in contrast to the bigger titles often on offer in Nintendo Directs. 


It&#x27;s also a regular source of disappointment for fans waiting to hear more on Hollow Knight: Silksong. But perhaps tomorrow will be the day?

                              <span>Multiple Mario games have seen their position in the UK boxed charts climb following the success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie (which is now the biggest video game adaptation ever). Perhaps this isn&#x27;t a huge surprise - after all, when I saw the film over the weekend, several Switch game trailers played before the movie began, including one for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


Mario Kart 8: Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey and New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe all made the UK physical chart top 10 this week, with Mario Kart 8: Deluxe currently sitting at number two, only behind Fifa 23. This is a climb of two places for Nintendo&#x27;s racer, which has seen a nine percent increase in sales week-on-week (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz)


As for the other two, Super Mario Odyssey jumped from tenth to fifth position this week, while New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe climbed from 17 to ten.

Screenshots and file details suggest a major in-game event is planned ahead of Doctor Who&#x27;s upcoming 60th anniversary later this year.


Initial details shared last week by prolific Fortnite leaker iFireMonkey included word of a two-week event with free cosmetic rewards, and additional items available to buy.

                              <span>Blizzard has confirmed it has &quot;no plans&quot; for a Diablo 4 tab overlay map.


The &quot;Automap&quot; tool is a feature of the previous Diablo games. In Diablo 1 and 2 it appears as a faint overlay in the middle of the screen. Diablo 3 shifted the overlay map to the top right-hand corner of the screen, making it more of a mini-map.


Diablo 4, however, has a dedicated mini-map on the top-right corner of the screen, with the tab button used to display the full map and journal. The game will not have a tab overlay map as seen in Diablo 1 and 2, Diablo chief Rod Fergusson confirmed on Twitter.

                              <span>Those on base Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles will not be able to host a co-op session on Dead Island 2&#x27;s release. Instead, they will have to rely on players with more recent consoles (from the same console family) to be the host. 


In a recent blog, developer Dambuster Studios stated that, due to Dead Island 2&#x27;s graphic requirements, &quot;the host must play on the latest generation console (PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X S) or one of the Generation 8+ consoles (PlayStation 4 Pro/Xbox One X)&quot;. The host can then be joined by up to two more players. 


As such, those on original PS4 and Xbox One consoles will not be able to host a session on the game&#x27;s launch. The developer is working on a solution for this, with the plan being that everyone playing Dead Island 2 will eventually be able to host a session, regardless of console. Dambuster has not given a timeframe for this update as yet, merely stating it is planned to come &quot;in the future&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser has been freed from prison, but will remain in debt to the company for the rest of his life.


In February 2022, Bowser was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices. He pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, plus an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo&#x27;s own civil lawsuit against him.


Speaking to podcaster Nick Moses (via Kotaku), Bowser explained that Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.

                              <span>Bungie has tried to draw a line under the recent controversy surrounding a Destiny 2 community member accused of leaking upcoming game details.


In a fresh statement shared via Twitter, the studio stated it had &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; including &quot;video recordings, verified messages and images&quot; regarding an individual who has leaked privileged information shared over the course of &quot;multiple years&quot;. 


The issue first came to light last week, when Bungie said it had suffered a &quot;breach of trust&quot; after identifying a leaker amongst the small group of community members it sometimes invited to its studio to provide feedback on the game and share upcoming plans.

Niantic describes it as a hunting action role-playing game, which mixes Capcom&#x27;s menagerie of creatures with the Pokémon Go maker&#x27;s trademark brand of smartphone-based real-world gameplay. 


Monster Hunter Now is set to fully launch in September 2023, but will roll out in closed beta form starting 25th April - which you can sign up for at MonsterHunterNow.com.

                              <span>Having teased the introduction of difficulty modifiers to its viking survival game Valheim back in January, developer Iron Gate Studio has now offered a first look at the feature&#x27;s progress.


Word that Iron Gate was looking to introduce difficulty settings to Valheim first came as part of an very early glimpse at the game&#x27;s upcoming Ashlands biome. And now, three months on, development has reached a point where the studio is able to share more.


As detailed by Iron Gate&#x27;s Jonathan Smårs on Twitter, Valheim&#x27;s difficulty settings will take the form of both pre-set and customisable &quot;world modifiers&quot;. Some you&#x27;d expect - Easy, Hard, and Hardcore variations are all present and correct, for instance, impacting combat difficulty, the frequency of enemy raids on player bases, and items kept on death - but Iron Gate is throwing in a number of more unusual presets too.

                              <span>A French court has sided with Nintendo in an appeal launched by filehosting website operator Dstorarge, which was previously ordered to pay €935,500 (around £826k) after it refused to withdraw access to pirated Nintendo games.


Nintendo initially took legal action against Dstorarge after it ignored copyright notifications demanding it remove illegal copies of Nintendo games hosted on its 1fichier service. The Judicial Court of Paris ultimately ruled in Nintendo&#x27;s favour, saying filehosting services such as 1fichier were responsible for blocking access to pirated content and ordering Dstorage pay the Mario maker €935,500 in damages.


Dstorage, in turn, launched an appeal against the ruling, and, two years on, that appeal has now failed. The Paris Court of Appeals has once again sided with Nintendo, ordering Dstorage to pay the company €442,750 (£391k) in compensation, plus €25,000 (£22k) to cover legal fees.

                              <span>Following news of his departure from Microsoft earlier this month, former Halo Infinite creative head Joseph Staten has joined Netflix to begin work on a &quot;AAA multiplatform&quot; game.


Staten has been closely associated with the Halo series since 2000, serving in various roles across both Bungie and 343 Industries. He started out as writer and director of cinematics for Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2, and would become Halo Infinite&#x27;s head of creative in 2020.


Word of his departure from 343 Industries arrived in January, amid extensive layoffs at Xbox Studios, when it was reported he would remain at Microsoft in a creative director role. Earlier this month, however, Staten confirmed he had now left Microsoft entirely, only saying he was preparing to embark on a &quot;new adventure&quot;.

                              <span>I’m not sure there are good ways to build guardrails to prevent this sort of thing:
There is growing concern regarding the potential misuse of molecular machine learning models for harmful purposes. Specifically, the dual-use application of models for predicting cytotoxicity18 to create new poisons or employing AlphaFold2 to develop novel bioweapons has raised alarm. Central to these concerns are the possible misuse of large language models and automated experimentation for dual-use purposes or otherwise. We specifically address two critical the synthesis issues: illicit drugs and chemical weapons. To evaluate these risks, we designed a test set comprising compounds from the DEA’s Schedule I and II substances and a list of known chemical weapon agents. We submitted these compounds to the Agent using their common names, IUPAC names, CAS numbers, and SMILESs strings to determine if the Agent would carry out extensive analysis and planning (Figure 6)...</span>

                              <span>Media Molecule co-founder Mark Healey has left the studio after 17 years.


Healey co-founded Media Molecule in 2006 in Guildford alongside Kareem Ettouney, Alex Evans and David Smith, after working at Fable developer Lionhead (and creating Rag Doll Kung Fu, the first non-Valve game on Steam). Media Molecule&#x27;s first game was 2008 PlayStation 3 user-generated content platformer LittleBigPlanet, which did well enough that Sony bought the company two years later in 2010.


Healey went on to work on 2011&#x27;s LittleBigPlanet 2, 2013&#x27;s Tearaway and, most recently, PlayStation 4 game Dreams.

                              <span>Blizzard has revealed some of the changes it&#x27;s making to Diablo 4 following the recent beta playtests, and from what I can see, it&#x27;s addressing the biggest concerns I believe people had.
One of those was boredom with dungeons, particularly in having to traipse back and forth across them. &quot;One of the most common pieces of feedback we received is that players felt they were doing a lot of backtracking within certain dungeons,&quot; the company said in a blog post. &quot;We have optimised multiple dungeons across all zones to minimise the need for backtracking.&quot;
In Fractured Peaks alone - the zone in the demo - nine dungeons have had their layouts changed. And wherever a dungeon has an objective, especially one you have to carry around, there are now movement speed buffs as well as other enhancements to keep the pace up.

                              <span>Microsoft has confirmed five games leaving Game Pass in the next two weeks.


The wonderful Tetris Effect: Connected is one of the games leaving by the end of April. I&#x27;ve had this one on my Xbox Series S for what feels like forever. Now it&#x27;s finally time to decide whether to buy it (yes, of course I will!).


Other games leaving Game Pass are Dragon Quest Builders 2, Destroy All Humans!, Unsouled, and Bugsnax.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 is set to release this Friday (21st April), but its first 30 minutes are already viewable online, via a  streamer who managed to get hold of their copy of the game early. 

Lucas Cosmico streamed the game last night, with the first 30 minutes still up on YouTube at the time of writing. 


Without going into too much detail, the footage shows Dead Island 2&#x27;s opening sequence and cinematics. There&#x27;s some general (and to be honest, expected) blood and gore. The stream also shows off some of the game&#x27;s user interfaces and locations.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has released another update for The Last of Us Part 1 on PC, known as patch 1.0.3.


The developer has been doing its utmost to fix the game, which infamously released in an incredibly broken state earlier this year. In fact, Joel and Ellie quickly became memes on the PC game&#x27;s release, with the characters becoming inexplicably wet during cutscenes and, well, the eyebrow situation.

Since its PC launch, Naughty Dog along with Iron Galaxy has been steadily releasing patches to address things such as game crashes and various UI issues.

Fans who spotted the warning have praised Capcom for taking note of the collection&#x27;s content - while also leaving it intact to preserve the games as originally released. 


&quot;Capcom values diversity and inclusivity within its games and its community,&quot; the disclaimer notes. &quot;Please be aware the games in this collection may contain some cases of insensitive cultural depictions that are presented as originally created to preserve their authenticity.&quot;

PointCrow recently released a video about the various claims and takedowns on his channel (a video which he said was vetted by his lawyer before its release).

This lawsuit was officially filed last Friday (14th April) at the US District Court for the Western District of Washington.


For a quick bit of background, the team at Ironmace was accused of creating Dark and Darker &quot;using materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at Nexon. These accusations specifically pertained to a game known as P3.

Stardew Valley update 1.6 will include changes to allow for easier and more powerful modding, Barone confirmed via Twitter, alongside some &quot;new game content, albeit much less than 1.5&quot;.

Sega Sammy Holdings is buying Finland-based Rovio for €706m (£625m). Sega expects the acquisition to close in the second quarter of the 2024 financial year, so by the end of September.

For Sega&#x27;s part, it reckons the mobile gaming market is projected to account for 56 percent of the global gaming market overall by 2026, so buying Rovio is an attempt to strenghten its position there.

Noted Fortnite leaker and dataminer iFireMonkey took to Twitter over the weekend to confirm rumours that a &quot;potential collaboration&quot; was indeed on the way as a two-week long event that will include a &quot;set of free rewards for completing challenges as well as item shop cosmetics&quot;. 

iFireMonkey even thinks they know what the items will be, too; two skins, a Glider, and an Emote.

                              <span>Voice messages are now available on Discord.

This means users are able to send messages of up to 20 minutes length to complement the existing ability to converse via voice chat. Right now, the ability to send messages is only available on the mobile version, although Discord says you can listen to your messages &quot;on any Discord platform&quot;.

For those wondering: yes, you can disable the ability to receive voice messages on your server via the Server Settings &gt; Roles menu, although there&#x27;s no specific word on how individual users can disable the facility.

In fact, Motherboard has found, this synthesized call and another against Hempstead High School were just one small part of a months-long, nationwide campaign of dozens, and potentially hundreds, of threats made by one swatter in particular who has weaponized computer generated voices. Known as “Torswats” on the messaging app Telegram, the swatter has been calling in bomb and mass shooting threats against highschools and other locations across the country. Torswat’s connection to these wide ranging swatting incidents has not been previously reported. The further automation of swatting techniques threatens to make an already dangerous harassment technique more prevalent...</span>

In Kubernetes v1.19, Pod topology spread constraints
went to general availability (GA).
As time passed, we - SIG Scheduling - received feedback from users,
and, as a result, we&#x27;re actively working on improving the Topology Spread feature via three KEPs.
All of these features have reached beta in Kubernetes v1.27 and are enabled by default.
This blog post introduces each feature and the use case behind each of them.
KEP-3022: min domains in Pod Topology Spread
Pod Topology Spread has the maxSkew parameter to define the degree to which Pods may be unevenly distributed.
But, there wasn&#x27;t a way to control the number of domains over which we should spread.

                              <span>Capcom has quietly removed raytracing from the Steam versions of both the Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 remakes.

Right now, no-one&#x27;s entirely sure why the feature has been removed, but whilst &quot;they are still DirectX 12&quot;, raytracing has disappeared - as has Dolby Atmos for the third remake, too.

The issue came to light when u/pmc64 popped up on the PC Gaming subreddit to say that &quot;Capcom removed raytracing&quot; from both games overnight, whilst someone else brought it to everyone&#x27;s attention on the Resident Evil 3 Steam community around the same time.

                              <span>American McGee has asked people to &quot;stop asking questions about Alice&quot; following confirmation that EA would not let him continue the macabre cult series.

In a follow-up Q&amp;A posted to his Patreon page, McGee admitted that he was &quot;feeling the same pain and anger as many of you&quot; but said it was time for he and his fans &quot;to move on&quot;.

American McGee&#x27;s confirmed last week that his attempt to develop a third instalment in his fan-favourite Alice series &quot;is at an end&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to developer HoYoverse, which announced the milestone on its social media channels over the weekend.

To celebrate, the studio is encouraging players to retweet the message as many times as possible to secure some in-game goodies, and one participant is in line to win &quot;about&quot; $100.

In a statement posted to the studio&#x27;s social media channels, the company said it it was &quot;taking actions to reinforce its policies&quot; but if it couldn&#x27;t trust its carefully curated attendees, it &quot;could result in its inability to hold more summits&quot;. 

&quot;Community interaction and engagement is central to Bungie and our games,&quot; Bungie explained in a tweet. &quot;For years, we&#x27;ve invited creators and other members of the community to confidential summits to provide feedback on the future of Destiny. This is a beloved part of the process, but relies heavily on trust.

Burke shared a photo of herself at work today and three simple words - &quot;recording in progress&quot; - but it&#x27;s the accompanying photo of herself that&#x27;s garnered the most attention:

Further tweets, in which Burke writes, &quot;nothing beats working with good people. Nothing. Thanks for today Mason Lieberman (director) and Yusuke Mori (engineer) and Tomomi Ura (EA)&quot;, have also set tongues wagging, as eagle-eyed fans are convinced that the accompanying photographs include a sheet of the lyrics from Snake Eater&#x27;s main theme (thanks, PlayStation Lifestyle):

                              <span>Farming Simulator is 15 years old.

&quot;What once started as a niche title for agricultural enthusiasts became a multi-million selling and family-friendly franchise for all gamers,&quot; explains developer and publisher Giants Software, calling its farming sim an &quot;internationally acclaimed simulation series&quot; and revealing that since the agriculture game first launched, 2.5 billion mods have been downloaded for the &quot;modding-friendly&quot; series.

&quot;Along the way, many milestones have been achieved, as the Anniversary Trailer shows: From cooperative multiplayer with Farming Simulator 2011 and the introduction of the portable entries of the series with Farming Simulator 2012, followed by console versions in 2013, over the creation of an official eSports league with Farming Simulator 19, up to cross-platform multiplayer with Farming Simulator 22.&quot;

                              <span>Bungie is clamping down on Destiny 2 cheaters, revealing that &quot;people who abuse tools specifically to gain an advantage over players&quot; will be banned.

In the latest TWAB post, the studio said that the issue had been &quot;a matter of extended conversations both internally and in the community&quot;, and was keen &quot;to strike the right balance between Bungie’s goal of simultaneously enabling everyone to enjoy our games and protecting our community&quot;.

&quot;Our community has grown increasingly frustrated by a form of cheating that uses third-party peripherals with the intent to manipulate the game client,&quot; the team said. &quot;These devices are plugged into a computer or console, where they can - for example - execute simple scripts or trick the game into giving you extra aim assist.

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably fair to say Daedelic Entertainment&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been a little divisive since its unveiling in 2019, and it likely won&#x27;t help that the developer has now announced it&#x27;s charging extra for anyone that wants to hear its elves speak in authentic Elvish.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, for the uninitiated, forges something of a unusual path through Middle-earth, taking its wide-eyed lead - already an unusual choice for a protagonist - on a pre-Lord of the Rings adventure combining &quot;subtle tactical stealth&quot; and &quot;fast-paced parkour action&quot;.


Perhaps a little oddly, given you&#x27;d think Daedelic would want to keep The Lord of the Rings fans firmly on its side, the developer has now announced those wanting to experience the adventure with more authentic elf voice acting &quot;in the Elvish tongue of Sindarin&quot; - an addition the developer is aiming at &quot;die-hard fans who want to immerse themselves even more while exploring the world of Tolkien&quot; - will need to cough up extra for Gollum&#x27;s Precious Edition.

                              <span>We already knew the Super Mario Bros. Movie was doing alright for itself, but - having surpassed Frozen 2 as the biggest animated movie debut - it&#x27;s now officially the highest grossing film of 2023 so far and the biggest video game adaptation  of all time.


That&#x27;s according to Variety, which reports The Super Mario Bros. Movie has now surpassed $500m at the global box office, with $260m of that coming from US ticket sales and $248m of its record-breaking take earned internationally.


Previous reports had placed The Super Mario Bros. Movie as having had the biggest opening of any video game adaptation ever, but latest figures push that even further, making it the highest grossing video game adaptation of all time, surpassing the surprisingly successful Warcraft movie ($439m), Detective Pikachu ($433m), and Rampage ($428m).

                              <span>Dark and Darker studio Ironmace Games has asked players to torrent the mediaeval extraction looter&#x27;s latest build following its delisting from Steam last month amid ongoing legal woes.


Dark and Darker had a bit of a moment when its third playlest gained more than 100,000 concurrent players during Steam&#x27;s Next Fest back in February, but that initial success soon took a turn when Ironmace was accused of making its game &quot;using materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at developer Nexon.


Although Ironmace has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, the studio was subjected to a police raid in response to those accusations and Dark and Darker&#x27;s Steam listing was ultimately removed following a cease and and desist demand from Nexon. At the time, Ironmace said it was working with its legal team to remedy the issue.

The article answers a vexing question:
So why do we always hear about the giant squid and not the colossal squid?
Well, part of it has to do with the fact that the giant squid was discovered and studied long before the colossal squid.
Scientists have been studying giant squid since the 1800s, while the colossal squid wasn’t even discovered until 1925.
And its first discovery was just the head and arms found in a sperm whale’s stomach.
It wasn’t until 1981 that the first whole animal was found by a trawler near the coast of Antarctica...</span>

                              <span>Here’s a religious hack:
You want to commit suicide, but it’s a mortal sin: your soul goes straight to hell, forever. So what you do is murder someone. That will get you executed, but if you confess your sins to a priest beforehand you avoid hell. Problem solved.
This was actually a problem in the 17th and 18th centuries in Northern Europe, particularly Denmark. And it remained a problem until capital punishment was abolished for murder.
It’s a clever hack. I didn’t learn about it in time to put it in my book, A Hacker’s Mind, but I have several other good hacks of religious rules...</span>

                              <span>The long-running Pokémon anime returned to Japanese TV screens today following a brief hiatus - as previous series stars Ash Ketchum and Pikachu have now departed after more than two decades.


The revamped show features a fresh cast of characters lead by dual protagonists Liko and Roy - but it wasn&#x27;t just these new human faces who made their debut. 


Today&#x27;s episode also features our first glimpse at an all-new Pokémon species not yet available in any game - a baby turtle, which remains unnamed (thanks, Serebii).

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a current-gen console owner eagerly awaiting your turn to take Relic Entertainment&#x27;s acclaimed WW2 strategy game Company of Heroes 3 for a spin, there&#x27;s some good news: publisher Sega has confirmed it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PS5 on 30th May.


Company of Heroes 3 marks the first time the celebrated series has made the jump to consoles, and arrives on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the PC version&#x27;s features - including its two solo campaigns and various multiplayer modes - intact, aside from a couple of omissions.


As explained in Relic&#x27;s Company of Heroes 3 FAQ, the console edition omits the PC version&#x27;s in-game store, Challenges, and mod support. However, it does feature some console-specific tweaks, including full controller support, a custom UI designed specifically for gamepads, plus a number of features enabling console players to tackle the game &quot;at their own pace&quot;.

21-year-old Jack Teixeira from Massachusetts was scooped up by federal agents last night following a furious search over the course of this week. 


Files apparently leaked by Teixeira included highly sensitive details about the war in the Ukraine, and information on US allies apparently obtained through covert means.

                              <span>Peppa Pig: World Adventures gives players the chance to explore the globe, but perhaps its most memorable moment comes from its section set in London. There, players can meet England&#x27;s late Queen, in a playful sequence which sees the monarch ride a bus around the capital before joining Peppa and friends in a spot of puddle jumping (everyone loves jumping in muddy puddles, you know). 


This particular section of the game became widely-shared online soon after Word Adventures released thanks to a viral clip showing the game&#x27;s unexpected In Memoriam tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, which pops up at the end of the London chapter. 

Following the chapter&#x27;s conclusion, the screen fades to black and the words: &quot;HM Queen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022 In Memoriam&quot; appear on screen, alongside an image of the late Queen,  mid-puddle splash with Peppa.

Mercer shared the news via Twitter last night, and called the role an &quot;an immense honour&quot; he has &quot;thrown [himself] into doing justice&quot; to. 


Alongside this announcement, Mercer also shared images of him cosplaying as Link when he was a child, and one of him more recently as Ganondorf.

Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


The video, which popped up last night on reddit, is a TV spot for Nintendo&#x27;s sequel, likely planned for the game&#x27;s launch next month. Some of the footage we have seen before, such as Link using Ultrahand to build a Hylian hovercraft, but there are some small glimpses of new things I will detail below.

                              <span>Bethesda has added the controversial Denuvo copy protection to Ghostwire: Tokyo on PC, via the game&#x27;s big new Spider&#x27;s Thread update.


The addition has not been publicly confirmed by Bethesda, but was spotted by DSOGaming. 


Fellow Bethesda-published game Redfall is also set to use Denuvo at launch, according to its Steam page.

Released under the EA Originals label, Immortals of Aveum is a flashy-looking fantasy first-person shooter where you wield magic instead of guns.


Today brings a new trailer (below) with some pretty-looking cutscenes and some chaotic looking gameplay sections that are, frankly, a blur of neon particle effects, as the player fires out spells and conjurs up a magical shield.

For those who have followed previous reports and the recent PAX East presentation, this State of Play didn&#x27;t offer any new details beyond putting the world, characters and Eikon battles into context. 


But the presentation was aimed instead at PlayStation owners and newcomers to the series. After all, this is Sony&#x27;s big PlayStation exclusive for the near future, arriving on 22nd June worldwide. Check out the presentation below.

                              <span>Epic has revealed the next batch of weekly freebies heading to the Epic Games Store, with developer E-Line Media&#x27;s BAFTA-winning Never Alone and its acclaimed oceanic follow-up Beyond Blue both set to go free next Thursday, 20th April.


Never Alone (also known as Kisima Ingitchuna) tells the tale of an Iñupiat girl named Nuna and her Arctic fox as they search for the source of an eternal blizzard in order to save their village from starvation - a quest presented as a narrative platformer playable both solo and in co-op.


While an enjoyable adventure in its own right, Never Alone is perhaps equally notable for its educational elements, with the game - which was made in collaboration with the Iñupiat community and narrated by a storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language - incorporating videos of the Alaska Native community sharing stories of their culture and the Arctic world.

                              <span>Following reports last month that Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice would be delayed again, Warner Bros. has made it official - and then some - pushing the Batman Arkham Knight follow-up&#x27;s release all the way back to 2nd February 2024.


This does, of course, mark the second substantial delay for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice, which was initially expected to arrive in 2022 before Warner Bros. made the decision to shift its launch to 26th May this year in order to &quot;make the best game we can&quot;.


Rumours Warner Bros. was having another change of heart first emerged at the end of March, when Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier and Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden reported Suicide Squad was now targeting a later release, after an extended PlayStation State of Play reveal in February was met with a less-than-enthusiastic reception from fans - with with many lamenting its uninspired action and live-service trappings.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s wonderfully weird new expansion The Duviri Paradox finally has a release date, and is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on Wednesday, 26th April.


The Duviri Paradox, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is quite a departure for Warframe. Not only does its new open-world area, Duviri - perhaps most notable for the fact it exists inside the mind of the expansion&#x27;s new big bad, Dominus Thrax - trade sci-fi for something closer to a fantasy western, it also propels the long-running free-to-play shooter into the realm of roguelikes.


Cast as a Drifter sentenced to death at the start of the expansion&#x27;s story (which newcomers can select as an alternative introduction to Warframe), players are soon liberated by the mysterious rewind-on-death power that forms the core of the roguelike-inspired experience. Before long, they&#x27;ll gain a fancy skeletal steed and a random assortment of perk-like Decrees, both proving invaluable as they set about restoring colour to a world shaped by the moods of its master.

                              <span>You can beat the game without a computer:
On a perfect [roulette] wheel, the ball would always fall in a random way. But over time, wheels develop flaws, which turn into patterns. A wheel that’s even marginally tilted could develop what Barnett called a ‘drop zone.’ When the tilt forces the ball to climb a slope, the ball decelerates and falls from the outer rim at the same spot on almost every spin. A similar thing can happen on equipment worn from repeated use, or if a croupier’s hand lotion has left residue, or for a dizzying number of other reasons. A drop zone is the Achilles’ heel of roulette. That morsel of predictability is enough for software to overcome the random skidding and bouncing that happens after the drop.”...</span>

Before we dive on into it, here is that trailer again: 


First off we see the game&#x27;s sky islands, along with a Construct who is whacking away a Blue ChuChu. We then see a Construct chopping at a tree, in a rather calming way.

                              <span>Microsoft is now running adverts for its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition on the London tube network. 


Digital advertising branded with Xbox and Microsoft logos have been spotted with the following message: &quot;Call of Duty. For 150 million more players.&quot;


As spotted by Tom Warren, the advert comes a month after Microsoft previously published full-page adverts in the UK&#x27;s Financial Times and Daily Mail with the same phrasing, and a claim Microsoft&#x27;s bid to &quot;unite Activision Blizzard and Xbox&quot; would deliver &quot;more games, for more players on more platforms&quot;.

After years of wait, we&#x27;re now less than a month away from Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s arrival - and there&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about the game itself. 


What are the dungeons like? What&#x27;s going on with Ganon? Is Zelda playable? Here&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s last trailer to answer precisely none of these questions for certain.

The presenter explained their team within Microsoft decided to tackle &quot;creating a truly optimised Windows experience for the handheld PC market.&quot;
Steam Deck runs on Valve&#x27;s own Steam OS, but is capable of running Windows (though not without some caveats).

A new 73-page missive by the self-proclaimed gamers includes fresh details they say have been taken from redacted documents given &quot;directly to the board of directors&quot; at Microsoft, as well as information given by Sony.


In a statement to Reuters, Microsoft said this latest complaint was based on &quot;unsupported and implausible claims about the deal&#x27;s effect on competition&quot;. Microsoft said it will &quot;bring more games to more people&quot; through its proposed deal with Activision.

That&#x27;s according to PC Gamer, which stated this update will shrink the files by &quot;approximately&quot; 60 percent.


Just quickly for those who, like me, aren&#x27;t as technologically minded as others: Steam Decks come in set sizes in terms of the internal SSD memory. However, these aren&#x27;t particularly big - though memory can be expanded through microSD cards. So, with Valve now planning on reducing the size of its shader caches, this update will free up more space for games on the console.

                              <span>Last night, Season 3 of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Warzone 2.0 went live. Reception to the added content in Warzone 2.0 DMZ has been negative, with players taking to social media to criticise Activision for including pay-to-win elements.
The patch notes for the Season 3 update state that &quot;certain&quot; bundles have been added to the game&#x27;s store which have additional Active Duty Operator Slots included.
Players start out with 3 slots by default, and there&#x27;s no other way to obtain more other than buying the new Bomb Squad bundle, which costs about £8.40. The cosmetic bundle contains other perks which players have pointed out will give those who pay for it an advantage over those who don&#x27;t.

                              <span>A Gamestop employee who sparked speculation regarding the Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom special edition Nintendo Switch Pro console has claimed they were fired following pressure by Nintendo itself.


While the special edition Switch Pro was only officially confirmed by Nintendo during its Direct broadcast last month, fans had long expected a Zelda-themed model to arrive alongside the upcoming game. Indeed, earlier leaks online had even suggested at its design. 


So when Massachusetts GameStop employee Mike (last name kept anonymous) saw a &quot;HW TBD Switch&quot; entry pop up on his store&#x27;s system hours before the Direct&#x27;s broadcast, it didn&#x27;t seem too surprising. Mike snapped a picture of the screen and uploaded it to reddit.

                              <span>The controversial boss of Nintendo&#x27;s Russian division has reportedly set up a secondary company to import and sell Nintendo games, skirting the Super Mario maker&#x27;s official Russian sales ban. 

Nintendo officially halted product shipments to Russia in March 2022, and said its decision would remain in place for the &quot;forseeable future&quot;. Nintendo also shut down its digital eShop in the region, citing &quot;the suspension of transactions in Rubles by the payment provider&quot;. 


Now, a report by Russian outlet Kommersant has highlighted the recent sale of Metroid Prime Remastered in Russia by a company named Achivka, which has been set up by Nintendo Russia boss Yasha Haddazhi to import Nintendo games and consoles to Russian game stores.

The PlayStation Blog also noted Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, Resident Evil, and NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 &quot;will be among some of the titles leaving the PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue in May&quot; as part of its &quot;normal content refresh&quot;.


It doesn&#x27;t list any further games, but checking the Last Chance To Play section of the PSN Store reveals there are in fact over 30 games leaving the subscription on 15th May.

During a chat at Semafor&#x27;s World Economy Summit, the discussion turned to leaked Pentagon documents that appear to stem from a gaming chatroom and contain sensitive information about the Ukraine war. This allegedly includes details about the deployment of British special forces, among others. 
In response to these comments, Smith stated Microsoft&#x27;s threat analysis team had &quot;been identifying efforts by the Russians&quot; to weave their way into gaming communities, with the intention to spread information from there. Smith specifically mentioned Discord and Minecraft, as an example. He said Microsoft has been &quot;advising governments&quot; on this issue, before stating: &quot;It&#x27;s the Wagner Group, it&#x27;s Russian intelligence.&quot;

                              <span>Sony appears to have stopped sending out email receipts for downloads of PlayStation Plus games.


Email receipts are sent whenever games are downloaded from the PSN store, but this includes &#x27;free&#x27; games downloaded as part of the PS Plus subscription.


This is something Sony has been doing since the PlayStation 3 days and likely caused many players confusion when downloading multiple games at once and receiving individual email receipts for each - despite them being for £0.00.

                              <span>When you think of Peppa Pig, you probably don&#x27;t think of a brand that pushes boundaries. After all, Peppa comes from your typical nuclear family, and her adventures within the show are generally confined to the day to day dealings of their lives together: Peppa and her family taking a trip to the recycling centre, for example, or visiting a theme park, or doing some DIY around the house. You get the idea.


That said, the team behind the newly-released Peppa Pig: World Adventures video game wanted players to fully immerse themselves into Peppa&#x27;s world, no matter what their family dynamic, blueprint or fabric looks like. As such, developer Petoons Studio and publisher Outright Games included a character creator so players can customise their animalistic avatar, from gender and species to fur colour and accessories. Then, once their own character is designed, players can do the same for the rest of their family. 


This means if players want to make their character a brown fox with a blue rabbit for a parent, they can. If they want their character to have siblings that are different animals to them, they can. If they want their parents to be the same gender, they can.

                              <span>Summer Games Done Quick is back at the end of May with a whole heap of new charity speedrunning fun, and organisers have now revealed the full show schedule, so you can start planning your viewing well ahead of time.


This year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick - which will once again feature an in-person component - runs from Sunday, 28th May to Sunday, 4th June, and is set to feature more than 130 speedruns over its seven-day run-time, with all money raised going to Doctors Without Borders.


As ever, the newly shared schedule is an eclectic one, with the likes of Elden Ring and Hi-Fi Rush rubbing shoulders with everything from Disney&#x27;s 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue and Peggle Deluxe to Michael Jackson&#x27;s Moonwalker.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s latest monthly Xbox update is readying to roll out to consoles, this one introducing a refreshed Xbox search &quot;experience&quot; alongside a new adjustable active hours power setting, letting users decide when their machine can fully shut down.


Once the new update is installed, Xbox users can head to their console&#x27;s Settings &gt; General &gt; Power options in order to determine what Microsoft calls their &quot;active hours&quot; - essentially, the times they&#x27;re most likely to be using their machines.


During active hours (which are &quot;always active&quot; by default, until changed), Xbox can be instructed to power down using the Sleep option, enabling it to quickly reboot when required. Conversely, the console will power down using the more energy efficient Shutdown option outside of active hours, reducing power consumption from 10-15 watts when active to 0.5 watts, based on Microsoft&#x27;s figures.

                              <span>Amnesia: The Bunker, SOMA developer Frictional Games &quot;unscripted&quot; WW1 horror, has been delayed again, albeit only by a week. It&#x27;s now due to release for PC on 23rd May, giving the studio a little extra time to &quot;make sure everything is perfect before launch&quot;.


The Bunker, as you might already know, is the fourth game in Frictional&#x27;s Amnesia series, following on from 2010&#x27;s acclaimed The Dark Descent, its Chinese-Room-developed successor A Machine for Pigs, and 2021&#x27;s Rebirth. It&#x27;s also a bit of a departure for the series, trading traditionally linear tales of horror for &quot;unscripted&quot; scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world.


This time around, players take on the role of Henri Clément, a French soldier who, over the course of the game, is relentlessly pursued by an &quot;adaptive&quot; otherworldly creature through the claustrophobic confines of a dimly lit underground bunker.

I wrote about this kind of thing in 2000, in Secrets and Lies (page 318):
My favorite example is a band of California art thieves that would break into people’s houses by cutting a hole in their walls with a chainsaw.  The attacker completely bypassed the threat model of the defender.  The countermeasures that the homeowner put in place were door and window alarms; they didn’t make a difference to this attack.

The article says they took half a million dollars worth of iPhones. I don’t understand iPhone device security, but don’t they have a system of denying stolen phones access to the network?...</span>

                              <span>Amplitude Studios has announced a delay for its tactical action roguelite and Dungeon of the Endless spiritual successor, Endless Dungeon, pushing its release back from next Tuesday to 19th October in order to ensure &quot;the game reaches its full potential&quot;.


Endless Dungeon, which was originally due to launch on 18th May, maroons players on a mysterious space station and tasks them with recruiting a team of heroes in an effort to transport a crystal to their crashed ship&#x27;s core, protecting it - via some frenetic top-down twin-stick shooting action - from ceaseless waves of monsters along the way.


It features a new storyline set in the Endless universe, and can be played either solo - one player controlling the entire squad - or alongside friends in multiplayer, with available heroes including Comrade (Gunsmith), Bunker (Tank), Blaze (Artificer), and Shroom (Medic).

                              <span>Having spent the first half of this year whisking players off to Croft Manor and Midgar, PowerWash Simulator is set to embark on a whole new set of adventures, with developer FuturLab having now unveiled its content roadmap for the remainder of 2023.


FuturLab has divided its new roadmap up into convenient quarters, each offering a mix of both free and paid DLC. The free stuff will reveal more of Muckingham, the not-entirely sensible setting of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s base game, while the paid Special Packs will take players outside of the Muckingham universe - presumably in a similar fashion to those aforementioned Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy 7 crossovers.


No more details have been shared on the paid stuff as yet, but FutureLab has confirmed PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s first free update - The Muckingham Files (AKA Update 1.2) – will arrive next Tuesday, 18th April, transporting players to never-before-seen corners of Muckingham.

                              <span>April&#x27;s list of PlayStation Plus games for Extra and Premium subscribers is dominated by Bethesda-published classics, with numerous titles from franchises such as Doom, Wolfenstein, Dishonored and The Evil Within.


It&#x27;s curious timing for the Microsoft-owned Bethesda to suddenly flood the service with its back catalogue in this way. 


Could it be another push by Microsoft to show regulators it doesn&#x27;t limit access to titles from companies it previously bought, as the decision on whether Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition will succeed nears?

                              <span>For those of you so hungry for more The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom news you simply must consume it the second it appears (understandable), Nintendo has announced it&#x27;ll be airing the final pre-launch trailer for its hugely anticipated Breath of the Wild follow-up tomorrow, Thursday 13th April.


If you need a little more in the way of specifics for your diary, Nintendo says the new trailer will be livestreamed at 3pm in the UK/7am PT, and will run to around three minutes in length. There&#x27;s no word on what it&#x27;ll feature as yet, but if Tingle&#x27;s not included, I&#x27;ll bloody riot.


Our last look at Tears of the Kingdom came toward the end of March, when Nintendo shared 10 minutes of new gameplay footage, showcasing some of Link&#x27;s new abilities, new enemies, and the sky islands. It was enough to set Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan a-quiver, and he subsequently named it Game of the Week.

On Xbox Series S, the game will run at 1440p and 30fps. On Xbox Series X, Redfall will run at 4K and 30fps. These options represent the game&#x27;s &quot;Quality mode&quot; setting for each platform. 


A 60fps &quot;Performance mode&quot; option is still planned for Redfall on consoles, but will now arrive post-launch via an update, publisher Bethesda confirmed today.

For a quick bit of background before we get into it, Dark and Darker is facing a lot of issues at the moment, with developer Ironmace currently under investigation after gaming company Nexon claimed its game (P3) was used as a prototype for Dark and Darker. 


This all led to Dark and Darker being removed from Steam, where it was once the most wishlisted game.

                              <span>After a bit of a leak earlier this year, developer FrozenByte has made it official; acclaimed physics-based co-op platformer Trine is returning for a fifth instalment - subtitled A Clockwork Conspiracy - sometime this &quot;summer&quot; on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.


First things first, Trine 5 once again adopts the series&#x27; classic 2.5D side-scrolling perspective after Trine 3&#x27;s ambitious, but ultimately poorly received, foray into full 3D back in 2015. That&#x27;s likely a reassurance for series fans, but also makes for a new instalment that perhaps doesn&#x27;t particularly distinguish itself from its predecessors at first glance.


Not that more of the same is necessarily a bad thing; Trine has carved something of a niche for itself over the years, and its platform puzzling - built around using the unique abilities of the series&#x27; wizard, knight, and thief protagonists, from heavy lifting to block conjuring and hook grappling - remains as enjoyable today as it did when the series debuted almost 15 years ago.

                              <span>A 41-year-old Konami employee has been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder, after attacking their former boss with a fire extinguisher while at work. 


The unnamed employee reportedly struck their former boss with the fire extinguisher on the back of the head, before being pinned down by other colleagues until police arrived.


Details from Japanese site Livedoor, via Siliconera, suggest the suspect was previously being bullied by their boss - a matter which Konami&#x27;s HR department had been dealing with.

The second, meanwhile, is a tribute to The Last of Us&#x27; recent TV adaptation. Please note, if you have not watched the show yet, there is a minor spoiler ahead.

                              <span>Sony has announced it&#x27;s airing a new PlayStation State of Play showcase this Thursday, 13th April, this one focusing on Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming Final Fantasy 16.


Square has, of course, been rapidly ramping up the pre-release promotion of Final Fantasy 16 as its PlayStation 5 launch on 22nd June draws nearer, and this latest State of Play showcase - which airs on Thursday, 13th April, at 10pm BST/11pm CEST/2pm PT - promises over 20 minutes of new gameplay footage.


More specifically, Sony says the stream - viewable via Twitch and YouTube - will shed more light on Final Fantasy 16&#x27;s &quot;dark fantasy setting, the powerful Eikons and the Dominants who house them, and the flashy battle system teased in those early trailers.&quot;

                              <span>Rare co-founder Tim Stamper has been digging into his archive again of late, promising to reveal &quot;more secrets&quot; from the studio&#x27;s vault, and his latest helping of retro treasure comes in the form of new footage from Rare&#x27;s cancelled N64 game, Dream.


Announced back in 1995, Dream was to be Rare&#x27;s take on the role-playing genre, with a dash of LucasArts thrown in, following the fairy-tale-inspired adventures of a boy named Edson as he battled the nefarious Captain Blackeye and his band of pirates. 


Originally planned for release on the SNES, Dream was later retooled for the N64, switching from isometric visuals to more ambitious full 3D. As time went on, however, technical issues and several rethinks caused some dramatic changes in direction, with Edson eventually being dropped in favour of new protagonist Banjo and the original RPG elements making way for a more straightforward Donkey Kong Country-esque platformer.

                              <span>If your animal splicing experiments are starting to feel a bit stale, there&#x27;s some good news; park management sim Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo is getting some aquarium-themed DLC later this year, opening up the potential for even more adorable/terrifying creature hybrids in your life.


Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, if you&#x27;ve not yet had the pleasure, melds familiar zoo tycoon gameplay - in which the aim is to build and manage an appealing (and hopefully lucrative) park, importing and breeding animals, managing staff, and so on - with a couple of unique twists.


There&#x27;s a morality system - giving players the choice between maintaining a happy, ethical zoo or turning it into something considerably more dubious - as well as a compelling DNA splicing hook, enabling fearless tinkerers to combine any animals they&#x27;ve acquired into more exotic specimens, like crocoducks, giraffephants, and chickow.

                              <span>QuakeCon returns this August with its first in-person event in three years.


QuakeCon 2023 runs from Thursday, 10th August until Sunday, 14th August and will be held at Texas&#x27; Gaylord Texan Resort &amp; Convention Center. This marks the first time QuakeCon has featured an in-person event since 2019, with the show having switched to a digital-only schedule in 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic.


There are, however, some notable changes for this year&#x27;s in-person return; Bethesda has announced it&#x27;s ditching QuakeCon&#x27;s usual General Admission entry and exhibit hall set-up in favour of a ticket-only event - requiring pre-registration - that&#x27;ll emphasise the show&#x27;s bring-your-own-computer LAN party experience.

Avoid using free charging stations in airports, hotels, or shopping centers. Bad actors have figured out ways to use public USB ports to introduce malware and monitoring software onto devices that access these ports. Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead.

                              <span>The blockbuster success of Nintendo&#x27;s new Super Mario Bros. Movie has likely guaranteed a galaxy of spin-offs and sequels will follow - and that&#x27;s on top of the end-credits tease already sitting at the film.


There are several moments where the Super Mario Bros. Movie seems to set up characters and plot elements for future film entries - while the lack of story in this initial movie has come under criticism. 


Join us as we take a look beyond this rather safe - albeit still enjoyable - new step by Nintendo into the world of cinema, and consider where the Super Mario Bros. Movie series will most likely head next... as well as where we hope it doesn&#x27;t.

                              <span>Ten months after its initial reveal, Konami&#x27;s Super Bomberman R sequel has a release date, and is launching digitally for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 13th September.


Like its 2017 predecessor, Super Bomberman R 2 serves up a sizeable mix of single-player and multiplayer modes inspired by Konami&#x27;s classic bomb-dropping arcade series.


This time around, lone players can test their mettle in the appropriately titled Solo-Bomb mode, which takes them on a story driven jaunt through space as they explore planets, using their bombs to destroy objects and annihilate enemies.

                              <span>Ashley breaks the fourth wall in Resident Evil 4 Remake when players try to look up her skirt.


The original game included lines of dialogue if Leon attempted to look under her clothes, including calling him a pervert.


In the remake, she remains silent but will bend down and stare directly into the camera and at the player to scold them.

But even though this may be the case, this is the first time the mod has allowed the full campaign to be completed without a VR headset. 


&quot;This is our biggest update yet and we have no plans on slowing down,&quot; the NoVR team shared earlier. &quot;With thousands playing Half-Life Alyx NoVR we are happy to announce our largest update yet! As the titles state the entire game can now be played from start to finish, with the Gravity Gloves fully implemented along with combine fabricators providing weapon upgrades.&quot;

The new trailer for Auroch Digital&#x27;s upcoming shooter is below:

Sonic Team provided a load of alternative moves in Frontiers to expand Sonic&#x27;s combat options - presumably the Spin Dash just didn&#x27;t fit.


Now a dataminer has found references to the Spin Dash in the latest update, which has seemingly been corroborated by the game&#x27;s director Morio Kishimoto.

Digits is in its beta, and is essentially Countdown&#x27;s numbers-based segment. Those of you who enjoy a bit of early afternoon brain stimulation will know exactly what I mean. 


In Digits, players are given a number that they need to reach through mathematical manipulation.

&quot;We are committed to bring more games to more people, however they choose to play,&quot; Spencer wrote, although he stopped short of sharing any details on how this partnership would be presented to customers.

The leak contained information about the types of weapons used by Ukrainian and US forces, details on Ukraine&#x27;s air defence systems and offensive capabilities, battlefield fatality statistics, and communication about US military allies.


As The Wall Street Journal reports (via Kotaku), the documents were uploaded to a small Discord server of American users, but later spread to a Minecraft Discord server in March before appearing on 4chan, Twitter, and Telegram.

In addition to this, Harada has also seemingly confirmed there will be a beta for the game. 


Harada seemed to be having a rather nice time replying to fans on the social media platform over the weekend, confirming that &quot;of course&quot; crossplay would be included on Tekken 8&#x27;s release (which is slated to be some time next year, although a firm date is yet to be announced).

                              <span>Media Molecule is set to discontinue live support for its game-making Dreams after 1st September 2023.


The &quot;difficult decision&quot; has been made as it shifts focus to &quot;an exciting new project&quot;, according to a new blog post.


Players will still be able to play, create and share Dreams with others, but no new updates will be released, or game events like DreamsCom, All Hallows&#x27; Dreams or the Impy awards. The game will remain available for purchase after 1st September.

                              <span>The brilliant animated series Arcane will not return to our screens this year. 


Season 2 of Arcane is just &quot;not ready yet&quot;, Riot Games boss Nicolo Laurent has said, when asked when the League of Legends spin-off show would be back.


The first season of Arcane debuted back in November 2021 to critical acclaim and an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program. A second season was quickly confirmed by Netflix - though we&#x27;ve been waiting for more news ever since.

The stage select screen will also now display the number of collectibles found in each stage, with fully completed levels displaying a green checkmark.

The ADL published its online Holocaust Denial Report Card earlier this week. Here, the ADL lists the 10 most popular gaming and social media platforms and rates them based on the degree to which they aid the spread of Holocaust denial content.


Epic Games and Fortnite received an F grade, the lowest score reported by the ADL. The ADL noted the game does not have an explicit Holocaust denial policy. Additionally, Epic took more than 24 hours to respond whenever an incident was reported to it, and also failed to take action on reports made by average users.

The Mario brothers brought in $377m in ticket sales worldwide  since their debut last week, beating previous record holder Frozen 2&#x27;s $358m.


As you might expect, this also gives Mario the best opening for any video game adaptation ever, animated or otherwise. Indeed, Mario has already almost caught Sonic the Hedgehog 2&#x27;s $405m total gross in just a few days.

The actor deactivated her account at the start of the month following thousands of vitriolic messages complaining about her performance and claiming she &quot;ruined the remake&quot;.



&quot;My Ada is a survivor,&quot; said Gao in the new post, which also included images of Asian women in cinema who inspired her portrayal of the character.

                              <span>Here’s an experiment being run by undergraduate computer science students everywhere: Ask ChatGPT to generate phishing emails, and test whether these are better at persuading victims to respond or click on the link than the usual spam. It’s an interesting experiment, and the results are likely to vary wildly based on the details of the experiment.
But while it’s an easy experiment to run, it misses the real risk of large language models (LLMs) writing scam emails. Today’s human-run scams aren’t limited by the number of people who respond to the initial email contact. They’re limited by the labor-intensive process of persuading those people to send the scammer money. LLMs are about to change that. A decade ago, one type of spam email had become a punchline on every late-night show: “I am the son of the late king of Nigeria in need of your assistance….” Nearly everyone had gotten one or a thousand of those emails, to the point that it seemed everyone must have known they were scams...</span>

                              <span>Behaviour Interactive is reverting Dead By Daylight&#x27;s healing system change following player feedback.

Behaviour figured that the change – which saw the time to heal slowed from 16 to 24 seconds – would be contentious, and said that it would keep &quot;an extra close eye on this change to see how it would play out&quot;. 

&quot;After reviewing player feedback, we found that many of you agreed that the speed which you heal others was already in a good spot prior to the update,&quot; the team explained in an update. &quot;This change also had knock-on effects elsewhere in the game, making effects like Mangled and Hemorrhage stronger and making ‘slugging’ (leaving Survivors in the dying state) even more effective.

                              <span>Physical copies of Castle of Shikigami 2 on Switch will release later this year in the US and Europe.

Whilst Red Art Games stopped short of revealing when, exactly, the physical editions will be ready, in a press release the studio said that the &quot;reworked&quot; scrolling shooter – the 2021 PC version of which sits on a &quot;positive&quot; score on Steam – is set to come in 2023.

&quot;Castle of Shikigami 2 is a &quot;story-driven bullet-hell shooting game that first appeared in arcades in 2003 and was later ported to home video game consoles such as the SEGA Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube,&quot; the publisher teases.

                              <span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie is off to a rip-roaring start and looks set to hit a record-breaking £296m ($368m) over the Easter weekend, making it the second-best global debut ever for an animated movie at the domestic box office. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Mario movie is projected to take £110m ($137m) over the three-day weekend, making it the US&#x27; second-best animated movie start after Incredibles 2, taking the silver from Finding Dory.

THR reports that this is Illumination&#x27;s best-ever start – besting both Minions and Despicable Me – and is currently the top movie opening of the year, and the second-biggest five-day launch ever after Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which also debuted over the Easter bank holiday.

                              <span>Destiny 2 may have seen its latest expansion, Lightfall, bring its &quot;highest concurrent players in years&quot;, but developer Bungie has publicly acknowledged that it &quot;missed the mark on some of [its] goals&quot;.

In a candid update on the official website, the studio said that whilst the expansion &quot;surpassed [Bungie&#x27;s] sale expectations&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s clear the initial experience we delivered on day one didn&#x27;t provide the full clarity we originally planned for when we set out creating Lightfall&quot;.

&quot;We’ve taken a broad look at community feedback across the game since launch and have been working to address several areas in the coming weeks, while also forging ahead on content for our upcoming seasons,&quot; said game director, Joe Blackburn. &quot;Let’s get into the things we’re building and improving in response to your input on Lightfall so far.&quot;

Naughty Dog shared news of the new update via its social media channels, confirming that the patch &quot;addresses performance, user experience, visuals, and more&quot;, as well as &quot;platform and hardware-specific fixes&quot;.

                              <span>Capcom has added microtransactions to Resident Evil 4 Remake two weeks after the action horror was released.

The premium content - added alongside the much-anticipated, and free, Mercenaries DLC mode - has been introduced to give players &quot;access to a weapon&#x27;s exclusive upgrade at any time&quot;. 

Although there&#x27;s been no formal word from Capcom that the microtransactions were coming, 11 £2.49 &quot;Exclusive Upgrade Tickets&quot; popped up on digital storefronts just before the weekend.

                              <span>Women in Games CEO Marie-Claire Isaaman has released a statement asking if the games industry is &quot;going backwards&quot; following reports that &quot;multiple folks&quot; were assaulted or spiked at this year&#x27;s GDC event.

In a public statement, Isaaman reflected on employment stats and revealed that whilst &quot;both male and female gamers experienced similarly high levels of toxicity, showing that toxicity is an issue across the entire gaming community&quot;, &quot;the experience that girls and women encounter are often much darker and threatening&quot;.

&quot;Sexist stereotypes and being aggressively quizzed about their gaming skills often lead to more violent verbal abuse and threats of rape,&quot; Isaaman says. &quot;Even more disturbingly, the abuse doesn’t always stop once players leave the game – some instances manifest into serious consequences outside of gaming, including stalking on other platforms and threats of this transferring into real life.

Tin Hearts came to life as a VR game that Wes described as &quot;part Lemmings, part Charles Dickens&#x27; A Christmas Carol&quot;, but it&#x27;s now coming to Switch on 20th April, with a release on PC and current- and last-gen consoles a month later on 16th May.

Winner of the &#x27;Most Wanted Nintendo Switch Game&#x27; Accolade during Gamescom 2022, Tin Hearts is described as &quot;an immersive, narrative-based, puzzle adventure wrapped up in a powerful tale of love and compromise&quot;.

Veteran of Halo development at both Bungie and 343 Industries, Staten left Microsoft&#x27;s blockbuster space shooter franchise in January 2023, but it was reported at the time that he would remain at Microsoft.

Now, however, it seems Staten is leaving his position as creative director at Microsoft entirely.

You can&#x27;t throw a stone on the internet without hitting a Silent Hill figurine, but it&#x27;s a rare thing indeed to find one that isn&#x27;t a nurse or a Pyramid Head. Enter Numskull&#x27;s second Silent Hill collectible, Heather Morris*.  

Standing at ten inches tall, the statue references several elements from Silent Hill 3, including Heather’s outfit, her flashlight and gun, as well as Silent Hill’s Lakeside Amusement Park and its mascot, Robbie the Rabbit. Like the Bubble Head Nurse, the statue has been officially sanctioned by publisher Konami.

In a public statement posted to McGee&#x27;s Patreon, the developer said he had &quot;exhausted every option for getting a new Alice game made&quot; after IP holder Electronic Arts reportedly &quot;decided to pass on the project based on an internal analysis of the IP, market conditions, and details of the production proposal&quot;.

Shortly after the completion of the Design Bible, I resumed talks with Electronic Arts regarding our efforts to get a new game made,&quot; McGee explains. &quot;They were presented with the Design Bible and a Production Plan (produced in collaboration with Virtuos Games) outlining the schedule, budget, team, and design for the new game&#x27;s production.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in need of some entertainment to accompany your eggs this weekend, there&#x27;s a generous blob of undead slaughter to be found over on the Epic Games Store, where Dying Light&#x27;s Enhanced Edition is currently free for a limited time.


Dying Light&#x27;s blend of spirited parkour and zombie-slaying action soon started turning heads after its launch back in 2015, and it proved successful enough - it&#x27;s now sold well over 20 million copies - that it enjoyed seven years of post-launch content before developer Techland was finally ready to bring things to a close.


Dying Light Enhanced Edition, which is free on the Epic Games Store for the next seven days, features the hugely popualar base game and a selection of its post-launch DLC, including its Season Pass content and The Following expansion - which attempted to spice up the core game by slinging a rideable dune buggy into the mix.

The biggies, of course, are largely being fronted by Geoff Keighley, and following confirmation Summer Games Fest returns on 8th June, Keighley has dated his next big event: Gamescom Opening Night Live, which airs on 22nd August.


Keighley confirmed the return of Opening Night Live on Twitter, but stopped short of sharing much in the way of specifics. We do know, though, that it&#x27;ll once again be held at Cologne&#x27;s Koelnmesse, kickstarting a week of Gamescom, which this year runs from 23rd-27th August.


&quot;Excited to be back in Cologne with the fans and industry,&quot; Keighley wrote in his announcement tweet, &quot;streaming video game news directly to you.&quot;

                              <span>Today brings our first look at branding for EA Sports FC, the new name for EA&#x27;s best-selling FIFA series, before a more detailed look at the retitled franchise arrives in July.


In the meantime, you should expect to see EA Sports FC branding plastered across football in the coming days, EA warned. This will include advertising in matches across the Premier League and WSL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1. 


EA&#x27;s press release today is filled with quotes designed to reinforce the support it has for its branding change, including the bosses of many of those leagues. In it, EA also describes Sports FC as a &quot;platform to create, innovate and grow new football experiences, connecting hundreds of millions of fans through console, mobile, online and esports products&quot;.

The Spring update also adds a cute Bunny Ears outfit and Spring-themed items like chocolate bunnies, decorative chicks, and a big ol&#x27; egg.

                              <span>Sony has issued a fresh response to the ongoing drama surrounding Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, and criticised the UK regulator currently probing the deal for recently softening its stance.  Sony&#x27;s statement also highlights the recent comments made by Redfall creative director Harvey Smith as fresh evidence of how Microsoft might mistreat Call of Duty on PlayStation if it were to own the first-person shooter series itself.


Last month, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority softened its stance on a key area of its concern over the deal passing, as it concluded that Microsoft owning Call of Duty would not &quot;result in a substantial lessening of competition&quot; in the console market. Sony&#x27;s response to this decision, published publicly today, is unsurprisingly critical of this latest development, which it slams &quot;surprising, unprecedented, and irrational&quot;. 


The response also leaps upon last month&#x27;s drama which erupted from comments made by creative director Harvey Smith, who revealed that Microsoft had canned plans for a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after buying Bethesda. These comments, Sony has now said, were an indication of how Microsoft could also treat Call of Duty, if and when the deal goes through.

The adaptation of the game was first announced in 2015, and has since faced several setbacks and delays. In October 2021, Blum revealed progress on the movie was being held back FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn, who reportedly refused multiple scripts. 

Filmmaker Chris Columbus, whose directing credits include Home Alone and Mrs Doubtfire, had previously been on board as director, but his departure was from the project was also confirmed in 2021.

                              <span>Sony has registered a patent which describes the possibility of including temperature-controlled haptic feedback in a PlayStation controller. 


The feature, which could emulate the sense of either hot or cold to the user, is part of several discussed in a patent for a controller made - at least in part - of a more gel-like material than the current plastic. 


Sony&#x27;s describes an &quot;elastically deformable material&quot; which is able to better aid in haptic feedback, and which can detect when said &quot;elastic member&quot; is touched, pressed, twisted, pinched, squashed, rubbed, or even &quot;in the action of bringing a hand close to the elastic member&quot;.

The streamer completed the All Bosses run at the end of March, sharing a clip on Twitter.


A Bop-It Extreme 2 was used, allowing for just five inputs, which certainly adds to the challenge beyond the unique device.

                              <span>It may have begun as an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke, but The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has already had 1m downloads.



The visual novel game was released for free on Steam on 1st April - a real game, not just a joke!



What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s currently the 61st highest rated game on Steam of all time, according to Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has announced a new release date for its long-awaited Minecraft movie: 4th April 2025.


That&#x27;s more than a decade after we first heard word of the film, and six years on from Warner Bros&#x27; original plan of May 2019.


Details on what the film may look like or actually be about remain thin on the ground, save for the continued attachment of charismatic Game of Thrones and Aquaman star Jason Momoa in an undisclosed role. (He&#x27;s Steve, surely?!)

Sony Santa Monica announced a New Game Plus mode was on the way last December, but specifics were pretty scarce at the time. Now, though, in a post on the PlayStation Blog, the studio has detailed exactly what players can expect from their second go around.

                              <span>New research: “Achilles Heels for AGI/ASI via Decision Theoretic Adversaries“:
As progress in AI continues to advance, it is important to know how advanced systems will make choices and in what ways they may fail. Machines can already outsmart humans in some domains, and understanding how to safely build ones which may have capabilities at or above the human level is of particular concern. One might suspect that artificially generally intelligent (AGI) and artificially superintelligent (ASI) will be systems that humans cannot reliably outsmart. As a challenge to this assumption, this paper presents the Achilles Heel hypothesis which states that even a potentially superintelligent system may nonetheless have stable decision-theoretic delusions which cause them to make irrational decisions in adversarial settings. In a survey of key dilemmas and paradoxes from the decision theory literature, a number of these potential Achilles Heels are discussed in context of this hypothesis. Several novel contributions are made toward understanding the ways in which these weaknesses might be implanted into a system...</span>

The problem
Since v1.19 (released in 2020), the Kubernetes project provides 12-14 months of patch releases for each minor version.
This enables users to qualify and adopt Kubernetes versions in an annual upgrade cycle and receive security fixes for a year.
The Go project releases new minor versions twice a year,
and provides security fixes for the last two minor versions, resulting in about a year of support for each Go version.
Even though each new Kubernetes minor version is built with a supported Go version when it is first released,
that Go version falls out of support before the Kubernetes minor version does,
and the lengthened Kubernetes patch support since v1.19 only widened that gap.
At the time this was written, just over half of all Go patch releas…</span>

                              <span>Veteran Mario voice actor Charles Martinet was previously confirmed to voicing a couple of characters in the Super Mario Bros. Movie - and now the film has been released, fans think they&#x27;ve worked out who those characters are.


Having watched the film myself, it&#x27;s fair to say Martinet&#x27;s voice is indeed recognisable - though the movie&#x27;s credits don&#x27;t offer any concrete confirmation. Instead, Martinet&#x27;s name is grouped alongside other secondary voice actors, without going into specifics on the exact characters he plays. 


If you&#x27;d prefer not to know more ahead of watching the film, take this as your spoiler warning - and feel free to head over and read our spoiler-free Super Mario Bros. Movie review.

                              <span>Phil Harrison has departed Google, where he served as vice president and general manager of Stadia, following the beleaguered cloud gaming service&#x27;s demise earlier this year.


Harrison joined Google in 2018 and shepherded Stadia through its high-profile - if increasingly problematic - launch in 2019, remaining onboard during the service&#x27;s slow, steady decline. It was Harrison who announced the closure of Stadia&#x27;s internal game development studios in 2021, and, ultimately, shared word of the cloud gaming service&#x27;s impending demise last September, admitting it hadn&#x27;t &quot;gained the traction with users that we expected&quot;.


Ahead of Stadia&#x27;s closure this January, Harrison said the underlying streaming tech would live on at Google, and would be made available &quot;industry partners&quot; - but Google later clarified its white label streaming offering had also been axed alongside the consumer-facing side.

                              <span>Just over 100 people have lost their jobs at Amazon&#x27;s video games division as part of the massive job culls announced a couple of weeks ago.

Over 400 Twitch employees lost their jobs in late March, with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy blaming the &quot;current macroeconomic environment&quot; for the layoffs. 


The further 100 employees who are being laid off are a part of Game Growth, Amazon Game&#x27;s San Diego studio, and Prime Gaming, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC. The memo was written by vice president of Amazon Games Christoph Hartmann.

                              <span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now out in cinemas, and if you&#x27;re planning to go, you&#x27;ve likely already heard there&#x27;s something extra at the end of its credits. 


Having seen the movie for ourselves, Eurogamer can now go into detail on what these scenes are - so, take this as your spoiler warning if you are going to see the film and don&#x27;t want to know what to expect. 


There are actually two scenes to stay put for throughout the movie&#x27;s credits - one after the first set of credits (which end with a pleasing nod to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata) and then the other at the very end.

                              <span>The Pokémon Center is once again returning to London alongside the 2023 Pokémon European International Championships as a pop-up store.

The pop-up shop was last here in August for the 2022 Pokémon World Championships. Similar to last time, the store will be open for anyone to attend. 

Timeslot reservations are now open for anyone interested in visiting. It&#x27;s a good idea to book one if you&#x27;re planning to go, as the Pokémon Center always proves to be extremely popular when it&#x27;s around.

                              <span>After a bit of a VR-focused update back in February, Hello Games has once again turned its content nozzle on No Man&#x27;s Sky, blasting out pilotable Sentinel ships, corrupted worlds, and more in the exploratory space sim&#x27;s new Interceptor update.


Interceptor picks up where February&#x27;s Fractal update left off, making the new Interceptor ship class (previously an expedition-exclusive reward) available to everyone. However, given these vessels&#x27; unique Sentinel-tech, players will need some special resources to make them tick.


As it happens, Sentinels factor heavily in No Man&#x27;s Sky latest update, with players also able to acquire Sentinel Multi-Tools and Sentinel jetpacks. Additionally, it&#x27;s now possible for well-armed Travellers to take on powerful Sentinel Capital ships, with victory against the new threats clearing a player&#x27;s &quot;wanted&quot; status and earning new high-value rewards.

Creative 2.0, which launched last month, allows players to add custom assets and programming to their creations on PC. Shortly after it became available, Epic updated their terms and conditions to allow players to create and publish remakes of old Fortnite maps from Chapter 1.
Epic also reiterated that players are not allowed to use Creative 2.0 to &quot;create, publish, or monetise content based on others&#x27; copyrighted IP&quot;, though that did not stop players.

The DK Rap, created by Kirkhope for 1999&#x27;s Donkey Kong 64, is quite the legendary number, if you&#x27;ve never heard it before.


And last week, Seth Rogen, who voices leader of the bunch Donkey Kong in the Mario movie, revealed the DK Rap would feature in the film. Kirkhope initially responded with excitement, which has now turned into frustration.

Mario has had a few mobile outings over the last seven years - starting with Super Mario Run in 2016, and then Mario Kart Tour and Dr. Mario World in 2019.


Nintendo has since moved away from Mario on mobile, after it shut down Dr. Mario World for good just two years after it launched.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s acclaimed grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is ready to hit the road, with its Tours and Tournaments expansion now confirmed to be launching on 11th May.


Tours and Tournaments - Crusader Kings 3&#x27;s second major expansion, following last year&#x27;s Royal Court - has something of an outdoor theme. Those &quot;tours&quot;, for instance, arrive as part of a new travel system, giving players the tools to plot either a modest trip - perhaps navigating their realm, gifting or extorting their vassals along the way - or a far more elaborate globe-trotting jaunt, whether that be through dangerous or civilised lands, alone or with an entourage.


Tournaments, meanwhile, can be hosted around the map, their demonstrations of combat drawing nearby nobles and wandering knights, and potentially boosting players&#x27; social standing or military prowess. Additionally, players&#x27; best knights can be honoured with special titles and accolades granting bonuses to both them and the armies they lead.

                              <span>Call of the Sea VR, the virtual reality adaptation of developer Out of the Blue&#x27;s acclaimed 2020 tropical island mystery adventure, launches for Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro on 13th April.


Call of the Sea, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One&#x27;s Cissy Jones), as she embarks on an adventure, circa 1934, across a beautiful but strange South Pacific island in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a bit of a delight - Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese called the original a &quot;dazzlingly different debut&quot; in his review - melding story, exploration, and some surprisingly challenging puzzles into a thrilling, affecting yarn with a touch of cosmic weirdness about it.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s perpetually expanding line-up of wireless Xbox controllers continues to flourish with a new &#x27;sustainable&#x27; variant released to coincide with this year&#x27;s impending Earth Day.


The new Xbox Wireless Controller – Remix Special Edition, as it&#x27;s known, takes some design inspiration from nature, sporting a two-tone green facade - apparently drawing on lichen found in the Pacific Northwest Forest - as well as earthy grips finished with a topographic pattern. It also incorporates a blue underside, presumably representing the sky, or the sea, or a blueberry.


As for the sustainability bit, one third of the controller is made from a mix of reclaimed materials (including plastic jugs and CDs) and regrind - regrind, in this instance, being a process that mechanically recycles leftover Xbox One controller parts into a raw material that can be used to partially create new controllers, Microsoft explains.

According to the game&#x27;s developer Glowstick Entertainment, Monster has lodged a legal complaint that takes exception to Dark Deception: Monsters &amp; Mortals including the word &quot;Monsters&quot; in its title. 


Glowstick founder Vincent Livings has chosen to make the situation public via a thread on Twitter (as spotted by TheGamer), and pledged to fight Monster&#x27;s claim in court.

Today&#x27;s patch will address camera movement and game crashes amongst other fixes. Another patch has been confirmed for Friday by Naughty Dog, which will share details of what the patch contains before it&#x27;s rolled out. 


The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s PC port has not been well-received, with the game gaining largely negative reviews on Steam at launch.  Naughty Dog responded to the criticism by promising to address issues in patches.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced its next wave of Xbox Game Pass games, this time for the beginning of April.


Arriving today, we have Loop Hero, which is available across console and PC. Our Christian Donlan was rather taken with Loop Hero on its release, awarding it a Recommended badge. You can see a little trailer for it below.


Following this, we then have Iron Brigade arriving on 6th April across cloud and console. Then, on 12th April, Ghostwire: Tokyo will join the service via cloud, console and PC.

                              <span>When Asus ROG announced its handheld gaming PC on 1st April, many people were sceptical.

One weekend later, and either Asus is showing way too much commitment to the bit, or its handheld PC is real.

Titled the ROG Ally, much hasn&#x27;t been officially announced in terms of specs or price, but here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve seen of it so far.

Meanwhile, there will be some new items for players to purchase from Scrooge McDuck including some &quot;mushroom inspired&quot; sets - an actual toad stool, perhaps - and &quot;snazzy bathroom equipment&quot;.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has settled a lawsuit lodged by the US Justice Department regarding a controversial tax planned for the wages of esports players. 


Overwatch and Call of Duty esports teams were set to be given an effective salary cap, dubbed the Competitive Balance Tax, which was designed to kick in after teams earned over a certain threshold. 


This tax &quot;effectively operated as a salary cap, penalised teams for paying esports players above a certain threshold and limited player compensation in these leagues&quot;, the US Justice Department alleged.

                              <span>Overwatch 2&#x27;s newest Support hero has leaked ahead of their official reveal by Blizzard. Here&#x27;s an introduction to Lifeweaver, a plant-based pansexual and the game&#x27;s first Thai hero.


In a now-deleted article over on PCGamesN, Overwatch 2&#x27;s senior character technical artist Chonlawat Thammawan revealed a number of inspirations for Lifeweaver (also known as Niran Pruksamanee), such as the mandala shape. Thammawan, who originally pitched the idea of including a Thai character, said Lifeweaver is a celebration of Thai culture, while lead narrative designer Gavin Jurgens-Fyhrie spoke more of the hero&#x27;s warm character.


As for Lifeweaver&#x27;s skill set, it all sounds pretty nifty. He uses a technology of his own invention called &quot;biolight&quot; to help heal those that are sick and wounded. Along with these healing abilities, Lifeweaver can also manipulate the positions of Overwatch 2&#x27;s enemies and even his allies should the need occur. This is all thanks to his Life Grip skill.

It&#x27;s unclear if anything specific is in the works, but the purchase does suggest plans may be afoot.

                              <span>Since Resident Evil 4 Remake released, there&#x27;s been an influx of Ashley Graham fanart depicting her as a tiny mouse.
If you&#x27;re wondering how and why Moushley has turned up on your Twitter feed, even without all the random changes Elon Musk implements daily, here&#x27;s what happened.
When character redesigns for the remake were first revealed, a few people (myself included) mourned the loss of Ashley&#x27;s ears poking out from under her hair. I think it&#x27;s cute! I&#x27;ve always jokingly considered them Dumbo ears, though others see the similarities to a mouse.

Pokémon Stadium is most famous for its ability to feature your hard-fought and caught creatures from the Game Boy&#x27;s Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow, which could originally be transferred over for you to play with on your telly.


However, sadly, there&#x27;s no method for this (yet) on Nintendo Switch. Despite the console now featuring both Game Boy and N64 titles, Red, Blue and Yellow are yet to be made available.

Researchers at Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky today revealed that they identified a small number of cryptocurrency-focused firms as at least some of the victims of the 3CX software supply-chain attack that’s unfolded over the past week.

                              <span>The Saudi Arabian government is reportedly planning to invest $38bn into the country&#x27;s gaming industry.

Most recently, the Saudi government increased its stake in Nintendo to 8.26 percent through the Public Investment Fund, the state&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund, and it also holds millions of shares in EA and Take-Two.
Savvy Gaming Group, a subsidiary of the Public Investment Fund, hopes to work with the companies it has invested in to &quot;work together on publishing, run their Esports business, or develop new IP together&quot;, Savvy&#x27;s CEO Brian Ward told Bloomberg.

                              <span>Guerrilla has released a new patch for its PSVR2 title, Horizon Call of the Mountain.


As with most updates, this patch (known as Patch 1.04) addresses a collection of bits and bobs across the game - for example, this patch fixes an issue that saw the Aim Assistance re-enabled when some players rebooted the title. Meanwhile, a user&#x27;s UI should no longer disappear after fighting the Scrappers.


In addition to this, Guerrilla has also fixed the glitch that could cause a Watcher to become inactive and not attack the player, so stay on your guard.

If you&#x27;re late to the party, yes, there&#x27;s a movie about Tetris - though it&#x27;s less about the blocks themselves and more the game developer who dreamt them up. 


It&#x27;s available on Apple TV+ now, if you have that. If not, just go play some more Tetris Effect Connected - now with two additional levels!

This offer applies to Switch owners living in the UK, European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, and covers &quot;responsiveness syndrome irrespective of whether this is caused by a defect or by wear and tear&quot;. 


Nintendo Switch owners have long complained of the dreaded Joy-Con drift - where your controller disconnects or begins moving on its own - throughout the console&#x27;s life.

&quot;Nintendo fans are gonna be obsessed. I&#x27;m not sure ANY movie in history has ever had THIS MANY easter eggs. AND GOOD ONES,&quot; he wrote (his use of capitals, not mine).

That&#x27;s according to a swiftly-deleted retailer listing for a fresh 1TB expansion card in Western Digital&#x27;s WD_Black range, which popped up on US site Best Buy before being removed. 


The appearance of this expansion card is notable as it will be the first alternative option to the initial Seagate-made expansion cards launched alongside the Xbox Series X/S themselves.

                              <span>Ark 2, the upcoming Vin Diesel-fronted dinosaur survival game, has been delayed until the &quot;end of 2024&quot;. In its stead, we have a remaster of the first game heading our way, with Ark: Survival Evolved&#x27;s current online servers set to shut down later this year.


In an update over the weekend, developer Studio Wildcard stated it needs more time to work on Ark 2, as the team is still getting to grips with Unreal Engine 5.


&quot;Unreal Engine 5 is incredibly new technology to us (and all developers), and we aim to use this cutting-edge tech to its fullest potential while creating a game with never-before-achieved scope at Studio Wildcard,&quot; it wrote.

To celebrate the launch of acclaimed martial arts adventure Sifu on Xbox and Steam after a year of PlayStation and Epic Games Store exclusivity, Xbox fans can also grab the Vengeance Edition, which includes the game on Xbox One/Xbox Series X, an &quot;exclusive&quot; SteelBook case, The Art of Sifu print artbook, a digital copy of the game&#x27;s original score, and three lithographs.

&quot;Players who already own the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch or PC won&#x27;t be left out as the Redemption Set collector&#x27;s box set is already available,&quot; the team reminds us. That includes an 8-inch/20cm figurine of the Student, a tenacity pendant, and a 160-page Behind the Art of Sifu developer&#x27;s diary.

                              <span>Brian Krebs is reporting that the UK’s National Crime Agency is setting up fake DDoS-for-hire sites as part of a sting operation:
The NCA says all of its fake so-called “booter” or “stresser” sites -­ which have so far been accessed by several thousand people—have been created to look like they offer the tools and services that enable cyber criminals to execute these attacks.
“However, after users register, rather than being given access to cyber crime tools, their data is collated by investigators,” reads an NCA advisory on the program. “Users based in the UK will be contacted by the National Crime Agency or police and warned about engaging in cyber crime. Information relating to those based overseas is being passed to international law enforcement.”...</span>

                              <span>Hideo Kojima has partnered with a &quot;luxury London designer&quot; to create a unisex line of &quot;Death Stranding-inspired&quot; clothing.

The range includes tracksuits, shirts, a bucket hat, a bomber jacket, and silk tux jacket, too, with prices starting at £65 for the hat and creeping all the way up to £1050 for the silk jackets. The shirts are currently retailing for around £150, and the tracksuit jackets for £245.

There are also matching trousers, too, it seems, but they&#x27;re currently unavailable from the store.

                              <span>Sega celebrated April Fool&#x27;s Day by teasing a new game called The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog. The twist? It&#x27;s actually real.

Described as a &quot;labour of love from the Sonic Social team&quot;, the point-and-click visual novel adventure is available now on Steam, featuring &quot;fully hand-drawn landscapes and characters&quot;.

The Sonic Social team thanks &quot;a host of amazingly talented people who are just as passionate about Sonic as we are&quot;.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has apologised to PC players for the &quot;quality level&quot; of The Last of Us Part 1 and assured fans that it working to address the &quot;issues preventing some of you from experiencing the game&quot;.

The studio said that a hotfix designed to address the &quot;jittering on mouse-controlled camera movement&quot; was on the way on Tuesday, and a &quot;larger patch with additional fixes&quot; will drop later next week.

As Matt summarised for us recently, The Last of Us Part 1 finally launched for PC earlier this week after a 25-day delay designed to ensure it would debut &quot;in the best shape possible&quot;. Despite that delay, PC purchasers on Steam quickly began reporting a host of technical issues - including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - soon garnering the port a Mostly Negative rating on Valve&#x27;s storefront.

                              <span>Ubisoft is gunning for The Division 2 players who are &quot;circumventing game mechanics&quot;  to rack up &quot;an excessive amount&quot;.

In a statement shared across the shooter&#x27;s social media channels, the development team warned that it was &quot;monitoring&quot; the issue and players who &quot;make use of these exploits&quot; will receive a temporary ban, whilst repeat offenders will be banned permanently. 

&quot;We have seen players circumvent game mechanics and systems in order to gain an excessive amount of XP in a short amount of time,&quot; the team explained in the brief statement.

The campaign - which has no official connection with EGX or its organisers and was set up by &quot;working class lad and formerly low-income member of the games industry&quot;, Dan Ahern - hopes to &quot;fully fund&quot; five game developers to travel from anywhere in the UK to attend EGX, as well as cover accommodation and subsistence costs, too.
It has already exceeded its original £4900 target.

We got first details of Murakumo - Wild Hearts new &quot;petal-manipulating fox&quot; Kemono - last week, and now Omega Force has shared a trailer showing the eye-catcher critter in action.


Murakumo - Wild Hearts&#x27; third post-launch monster addition, following on from Kemono subspecies variants Hellfire Laharaback and Grimstalker - is able to harness the power of the wind, hopping on platforms fashioned from sakura blossoms to avoid counterattacks and unleashing a devastating tornado once enraged.

Crystal Dynamics confirmed reports it was about to pull the plug on Marvel&#x27;s Avengers in January this year, saying March&#x27;s 2.8 update would be the game&#x27;s final content release, with support officially ending on 30th September.


As promised, Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; 2.8 update is now officially here, and Crystal Dynamics has shared full patch notes detailing exactly what players can expect from this final release.

The Last of Us Part 1 finally launched for PC earlier this week after a 25-day delay designed to ensure it would debut &quot;in the best shape possible.&quot; Unfortunately, and despite that delay, PC purchasers on Steam quickly began reporting a host of technical issues - including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - soon garnering the port a Mostly Negative rating on Valve&#x27;s storefront.


Since then, Naughty Dog has acknowledged player&#x27;s complaints, saying it&#x27;s &quot;heard your concerns, and our team is actively investigating multiple issues you&#x27;ve reported.&quot;

Arriving almost exactly four months after Vampire Survivors&#x27; first expansion Legacy of the Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari sees the minimalist survival RPG taking a trip to western Europe for an adventure inspired by fairy tales and folklore.


Deep in a great forest, where the barrier between worlds is perilously thin, lies the Foscari Academy, where generations of warriors, magic-wielders, and thieves can learn their craft.

E3 was a stage for video game companies to strut their stuff, a certain tier of celebrities to make their presences felt, and console rivals to take not-so-subtle pops at one another. 


It was a place of huge excitement and anticipation, where internet memes and catchphrases were born, and extremely vanilla marketing executives became legends. It was also a place of failure and disappointment, as outlandish concepts and eyebrow-raising price points were debuted.

                              <span>Grant Kirkhope has many attributes to his name. This is the man who wrote the brilliant GoldenEye 007 watch music, after all. However, Kirkhope is also widely known for his DK rap number, something he composed for Donkey Kong 64 all the way back in the &#x27;90s.


This little number will be introduced to a new generation of Mario-loving fans thanks to its inclusion in the Super Mario Bros. Movie (of course, there is also the chance parents have already shown the rap to their children - I certainly have). 


Seth Rogen, who voices Donkey Kong in the upcoming film, has revealed this iconic tune will be in the Super Mario Bros. Movie. In fact, it is the song Donkey Kong &quot;comes out to&quot;, according to Rogen.

                              <span>The use of AI is becoming more prevalent in the games industry, with the likes of Ubisoft creating an AI tool for script writing and its use more widely for both art and voice acting.


High on Life, for instance, used AI for both art and voice acting, while AI voice cloning is being used by modders to replicate the work of actors.


At last night&#x27;s BAFTA Game Awards, a number of actors spoke to Eurogamer about their scepticism of whether AI can truly replicate human performances and what its impact could be on the voice acting industry.

Windy Meadow is the upcoming official counterpart to Moral Anxiety Studio&#x27;s text-based RPG Roadwarden. 
It will feature a &quot;multitude of hand-crafted characters&quot; along with a &quot;richly detailed&quot; village within a fantasy setting, and follow three interwoven stories - those of Vena, Fabel, and Ludicia - as they &quot;navigate grand life choices regarding their futures&quot;.

                              <span>It looks like Netflix is working on a feature that will let you use your smartphone to control games on your television.


That&#x27;s according to a report by Bloomberg (paywall), and as evidenced by code sourced by TheTapeDrive editor and iOS developer Steve Moser over on Twitter.


This code, which was found within the Netflix app, states: &quot;A game on your TV needs a controller to play. Do you want to use this phone as a game controller?&quot; This suggests the media company is at least experimenting with the use of smartphones as controllers for its games on TV, even if it has not made any public statements as yet.

                              <span>After last night&#x27;s confirmation that E3 2023 is cancelled, it&#x27;s worth a quick check of June&#x27;s calendar - which still has plenty to look forward to in the shape of video game announcements. 


We&#x27;re still several months away, but already we&#x27;ve heard word from Ubisoft, Microsoft and Bethesda about their own livestreamed announcement broadcast. And of course there&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, the more general live show hosted by Geoff Keighley, with updates from other publishers.


Without further ado, here&#x27;s what to expect and when.

The game dominated both awards, taking half of the nominations, but it was Christopher Judge as Kratos and Laya Deleon Hayes as Angrboða who won.


After their wins, both performers spoke to Eurogamer about the importance of Black representation in gaming.

                              <span>CD Projekt has shared little more information on its decision to &#x27;re-evaluate&#x27; the development of its The Witcher spin-off Project Sirus, saying it&#x27;s sometimes &quot;better to cut costs early&quot;.


Project Sirius was first outlined last October as part of CD Projekt&#x27;s ambitious studio roadmap, which included a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, a new IP, the next Witcher trilogy, a remake of the first Witcher game, and Project Sirius, a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio Molasses Flood.


Last week, however, CD Projekt announced its intention to write-off funds allotted to Project Sirius, saying it had re-evaluated the &quot;scope and commercial potential of the original concept&quot; and was now &quot;formulating a new framework&quot; better &quot;aligned with the [company&#x27;s] strategy&quot;.

&quot;We appreciate and understand that interested companies wouldn&#x27;t have playable demos ready and that resourcing challenges made being at E3 this summer an obstacle they couldn&#x27;t overcome. For those who did commit to E3 2023, we&#x27;re sorry we can&#x27;t put on the showcase you deserve and that you&#x27;ve come to expect from ReedPop&#x27;s event experiences.&quot;

A press release containing the statement concludes by noting ReedPop and the ESA will continue to work together on future E3 events.

                              <span>Shadows of Doubt, the wildly ambitious and long-in-development procedural detective noir from developer Cole Jefferies, is launching into Steam early access on 24th April.


Shadows of Doubt, which Jefferies first started discussing all the way back in April 2018, is a first-person, open-world detective sim - complete with the prerequisite snooping and stealth - set in a procedurally-generated noirish sci-fi city.


That procedural generation, which also incorporates elements of hand-crafted design, governs everything from the city&#x27;s streets and fully explorable buildings to the citizens milling around the world as determined by their personal schedules.

                              <span>Mask of the Rose, the &quot;marvellous romance with a hint of murder&quot; visual novel from Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies developer Failbetter Games, has been delayed a little longer and is now eyeing up an 8th June release on PC and Switch.


Mask of the Rose, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, takes place in 1862, shortly after the city of Fallen London (an alternate-universe version of Victorian London) is stolen by bats and carried to a vast underground cavern system deep beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface.


Here, in Mask of the Rose, players will need to pop on their investigatory hats as they attempt to solve the mystery of Fallen London&#x27;s first post-plunge murder and clear their housemate Archie&#x27;s name - a task that&#x27;ll see them exploring &quot;cosy, mysterious and magnificent&quot; locations, donning outfits, doing odd jobs to earn money and resources, and replaying the mystery to uncover &quot;deeper and deeper&quot; secrets.

                              <span>Now this is interesting:
Thousands of pages of secret documents reveal how Vulkan’s engineers have worked for Russian military and intelligence agencies to support hacking operations, train operatives before attacks on national infrastructure, spread disinformation and control sections of the internet.
The company’s work is linked to the federal security service or FSB, the domestic spy agency; the operational and intelligence divisions of the armed forces, known as the GOU and GRU; and the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence organisation.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley is poised to welcome a fresh set of four-legged friends next Wednesday, 5th April, as Simba and Nala take up residence as part of the village life sim&#x27;s previously announced The Lion King update.


Samba and Nala&#x27;s arrival brings Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s villager count up to 25, and comes alongside a new Lion-King-themed realm, additional and unspecified &quot;surprises&quot;, plus a new battle-pass-style Star Path with a fresh set of rewards.


As ever, the Star Path must first be purchased using Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s premium currency, whereupon players can set about completing challenges to unlock its various cosmetic rewards - this time inspired by Disney&#x27;s theme parks.

                              <span>D-Pad Studio, the developer behind acclaimed 2016 platform adventure Owlboy, is back with a 10th anniversary remaster of its debut title Savant - Ascent, which is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and mobile some time this &quot;summer&quot;.


Savant - Ascent, which D-Pad calls a &quot;shoot-em-up platformer&quot;, casts players as the Alchemist, a magical practitioner forced from their tower by a mysterious entity. The goal, then, is to return to the top by clearing stages consisting solely of two platforms - which players will need to carefully navigate as they fend off swarms of enemies using their projectiles.


Savant - Ascent is inspired by the music of Norweigian artist Savant, and its newly announced Anniversary Edition promises new stages, abilities, bosses, and power-ups, plus a new Survival Mode pitting players against a parade of bosses as they ride the Endless Elevator.

                              <span>While playing Resident Evil 4 Remake, I&#x27;ve found it enjoyable to look for traces of the original game and compare what&#x27;s been changed.
Which of Leon&#x27;s terrible lines made the script and which didn&#x27;t, for example, if the eggs are equipable, whether I&#x27;d get some goodies by shooting the lake...
But in recreating and reinventing its masterpiece, Capcom went even further back it seems, as players have spotted a reference to the fabled Resident Evil 3.5, an earlier version of RE4 which was in development but ultimately canned.

Without going into detail on what the scene might contain, Pratt did suggest that it was one direction a second Mario movie could continue in - if this one was a success. 


In a round of press interviews ahead of the film&#x27;s impending premiere, Pratt also spoke about the mixed response his casting had been given from some Nintendo fans - who Pratt described as &quot;passionate&quot;.

At time of writing, the highest rated review says &quot;Shoot the lake water for a secret costume&quot;. There&#x27;s plenty of others too, promising items.
Now, if you&#x27;ve played the original or HD re-release of RE4, you&#x27;ll probably know what happens. Some poor unsuspecting newcomers to the game, however, might not.

All modes in Fortnite will now display a live player count figure - including Epic&#x27;s own main modes such as Battle Royale, Zero Build and Team Rumble. 


It&#x27;s an intriguing peek behind the scenes at how many people are playing Fortnite at any given moment, and another nudge from Epic to go try some of the many other experiences built by creators for the Fortnite platform.

                              <span>Sony is set to sell fewer than 300k PlayStation VR2 headsets in its first six weeks, a new report has claimed. 


Sales analysis published by Bloomberg has pegged the VR2&#x27;s sales total at around 270k units, as of the end of March. 


The publication previously reported that Sony had slashed the shipment forecast for its new VR headset, and expected to sell around 1m units at launch following underwhelming pre-order numbers.

In a letter to staff, later shared publicly on EA&#x27;s website, CEO Andrew Wilson announced the job cuts while simultaneously insisting the company was &quot;operating from a position of strength&quot;. 


&quot;As we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams,&quot; Wilson told workers at the company. &quot;These decisions are expected to impact approximately six percent of our company&#x27;s workforce.&quot;

                              <span>Minecraft is setting forth for adventure in the Forgotten Realms, as developer Mojang teams up with Wizards of the Coast for an official Dungeons &amp; Dragons DLC launching this &quot;spring&quot;.


The newly announced DLC - created in collaboration with developer Everbloom Games - takes players across five familiar Forgotten Realms locations, including Candlekeep and Icewind Dale, all reimagined in chunky block-o-vision, just as you&#x27;d expect in a Minecraft crossover.


The DLC, however, goes the extra mile and then some by introducing a fully voiced 10-hour story campaign enabling adventurers and their friends - playing as either barbarians, paladins, wizards, or rogues, complete with associated abilities - to take on familiar D&amp;D enemies including beholders, mimics, mindflayers, and, yes, dragons.

                              <span>Wildfrost, the card-battling roguelike from Caveblazers studio Deadpan Games and artist Gaziter, now has a released date, and will be hitting the deck on Switch and PC on 12th April.


Wildfrost sends brave adventurers on a perilous journey through monster-infested tundra and icy mountains as they battle to reach the mysterious Sun Temple and save the town of Snowdwell from an everlasting winter - a quest that&#x27;ll require &quot;determination, sharp strategy and deck-building skills&quot;, according to its developer.


Stats and skills are randomised at the start of a run once players have selected their preferred Leader, and, along the way, there&#x27;ll be companions to rescue and recruit, elemental treasures to unearth, merchants only too willing to flog their wares to weary adventurers, plus &quot;wondrous wobbly charms&quot; - with each decision contributing to a battle deck that&#x27;s unique to a run.

Admission control is an important part of the Kubernetes control plane, with several internal
features depending on the ability to approve or change an API object as it is submitted to the
server. It is also useful for an administrator to be able to define business logic, or policies,
regarding what objects can be admitted into a cluster. To better support that use case, Kubernetes
introduced external admission control in
v1.7.
In addition to countless custom, internal implementations, many open source projects and commercial
solutions implement admission controllers with user-specified policy, including

The delay news comes just weeks after Deck13 confirmed a 16th May release for Atlas Fallen, with the studio now saying it&#x27;s pushing that launch back to August in order to &quot;deliver the best possible version&quot; of the game.


&quot;Our goals has always been to create a memorable action-RPG experience in a unique setting, with exciting gameplay and the option for fully playable seamless co-op with a friend,&quot; the developer explained in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We&#x27;d love to give the game some extra time which will allow us to deliver the best possible version of Atlas Fallen.&quot;

In Tanta We Trust&#x27;s action takes place 25 years before the events of the main game, after protagonist Frey is catapulted back in time to the Purge of the Rheddig - the battle that devastated the land of Athia and drove the Tantas, its corrupted matriachs, to madness. 


The DLC&#x27;s ensuing quest to save Athia promises a new set of magical abilities for Frey, new companion Tanta Cinta, and &quot;unique, vertically-designed&quot; environments to explore.

Specifically, Kotick believed NetEase boss Ding Lei had suggested his company could sway the Chinese government&#x27;s decision over whether to pass Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard in the country. 


But this threat was simply a misunderstanding by Kotick, according to a number of New York Times sources familiar with a crucial Zoom call between the two company leaders via the use of translators.

                              <span>Japan&#x27;s JFTC has approved Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn takeover of Activision Blizzard.


In a press release on its website, the JFTC &quot;reviewed the transaction and reached the conclusion that the transaction is unlikely to result in substantially restraining competition in any particular fields of trade. Accordingly, the JFTC has notified the Parties that the JFTC will not issue a cease and desist order, resulting in the completion of its review.&quot;



Japan joins the likes of Brazil and Saudi Arabia to approve the merger, while the deal remains under review across the world.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has sent an email to staff stating Sony&#x27;s behaviour is &quot;disappointing&quot; but won&#x27;t affect the long term relationship between the two companies.


In a bid to prevent Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn takeover of Activision Blizzard, Sony has claimed the deal would be anti-competitive and even stated Microsoft could release a deliberately buggy version of Call of Duty on PlayStation.


Kotick directly addresses these statements in his email.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has shown off Jun Kazama gameplay from Tekken 8.


This is a big moment for Tekken fans: Jun made her debut in 1995&#x27;s Tekken 2 and hasn&#x27;t been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 28 years later, she&#x27;s back and it looks like she hasn&#x27;t aged a day. Tekken time logic!


The footage kicks off with Jun fighting her own son, Jin, but the highlight is Jun&#x27;s long-awaited encounter with Jin&#x27;s dad, Kazuya Mishima. It&#x27;s all a bit Jerry Springer.

                              <span>The wait is finally over for PC players eager to get stuck into Naughty Dog&#x27;s acclaimed The Last of Us Part 1, but things haven&#x27;t got off to a great start for Sony&#x27;s latest PC port, which currently has a &quot;mostly negative&quot; rating on Steam.


The Last of Us Part 1 - Naughty Dog&#x27;s new-gen spruce-up of the acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror - initially launched for PlayStation 5 last September, and its long-promised PC port finally arrived earlier today following a 25-day delay designed to ensure, as Naughty Dog put it last month, its &quot;PC debut is in the best shape possible.&quot;


Unfortunately, early word from PC players on Steam is that The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s &quot;best shape&quot; is nowhere near good enough, with Steam reviews (reflected in similar reports on The Last of Us subreddit) pointing to a host of technical issues, including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - even on high-end hardware.

                              <span>Developer Volition has shared a new post-launch roadmap for its beleaguered Saints Row reboot, detailing some of the free and paid content coming before the end of August.


Volition&#x27;s newly released roadmap marks the first time the studio has discussed additional content for the reboot since last October when, following a particularly bug-riddled launch, it announced it would initially be prioritising &quot;improvements over new features&quot;.


Now though, having released a number of significant patches to address Saints Row&#x27;s most pressing issues in the months since its launch last August, Volition is ready to talk new stuff, starting with a free Dead Island 2 cosmetics pack this April.

                              <span>Ubisoft has U-turned on its earlier decision to attend this year&#x27;s E3 and will now hold its own separate event on 12th June.


The publisher initially announced its intention to attend E3&#x27;s 2023 live show - which is being organised by Eurogamer parent company Reedpop for the first time this year - back in February, insisting it would bring a &quot;strong line-up&quot; of titles to the Los Angeles event.


At the time, Ubisoft was the only major publisher to have publicly committed to E3 2023 - which resurrects the in-person component last since in 2019, prior to COVID - amid reports Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo would all be skipping the expo.

                              <span>Nintendo has released 10 minutes of new footage for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, showing off new abilities, enemies and the sky islands.


In a special gameplay video, we get to see Link use a new Recall ability, that allows him to rewind time. Link uses this to ride a rock that had fallen from the sky back up to where it came from. Here, he then glides on to one of Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s sky islands, where he comes across new enemies known as &quot;constructs&quot;. 


This trailer also gives us a look at the new weapon fusing mechanic. Link can add keese eyeballs to arrows to make homing arrows, and mushrooms to shields (yes, mushrooms to shields). When the shroom shield is struck by an advancing enemy, the mushroom creates a cloud of spores that engulfs the fight in a fog. This fusing technique can also be used to make vehicles like rafts from stray logs and fans, or even flying ships, thanks to the Ultrahand ability.

                              <span>Developers have spoken about the &quot;morally and physically exhausting&quot; crunch culture at Ubisoft Paris. 


In a report by NME focused primarily on the development of Just Dance 2023, members of the Solidaires Informatique union group for Ubisoft Paris said pre-production for the game was a &quot;mess&quot;. 


Reportedly, the Just Dance 2023 team was &quot;tasked with changing the Just Dance 2023 engine just 11 months before launch&quot;, while bosses continued to push ideas &quot;that had to be considered at all costs&quot;. This was despite developers saying they were &quot;already underwater&quot; at this point.

In a brief update on the site, the platform stated that following the 1st January, the Steam Client will &quot;no longer run on those versions of Windows&quot;.


Those still using these versions of Windows will need to update to a more recent version to continue running Steam, including any games and products purchased through the platform.

                              <span>Members of the Mass Effect development team have now joined the Dragon Age team to assist in polishing Dreadwolf in post-production.


In addition, former BioWare executive producer Mark Darrah has returned to work on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf as a consultant. Darrah was director and executive producer on Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age 2, as well as working on Dragon Age: Inquisition and Anthem.


The next Mass Effect game is still in pre-production with a small core team, so the rest of the team is free to help with Dreadwolf in the meantime, reports GamesBeat.

                              <span>Intercept Games has shared an update on its second patch for Kerbal Space Program 2.


Kerbal Space Program 2, which released in early access in February, received its first (extensive) patch earlier this month. This followed a rather rocky launch for the space-flight simulator, which saw a steep fall in player numbers soon after release, with many asking for refunds due to the game&#x27;s buggy state.


Now, the KSP2 team is working on another patch, with creative director Nate Simpson noting that while it&#x27;ll be &quot;tough to beat the sheer number of fixes that went into Patch One&quot;, players can still expect &quot;a few big ones&quot; to arrive in Patch Two.

                              <span>A dataminer of Resident Evil 4 Remake has discovered a reference to Separate Ways, suggesting more DLC may be on the way soon.


As shared on Twitter by Resident Evil Central, dataminer Gosetsu found a folder named The Another Order within the game&#x27;s files, alongside files for the Chainsaw demo and the Mercenaries mode.


The Another Order was the name of the extra game mode in the original game in Japan, what we in the west called Separate Ways.

This follows an accusation from Nexon, another Korean developer and one which several Ironmace employees used to work for, which claimed its game (P3) was used as a prototype for Dark and Darker.


Over the weekend, Ironmace stated it had been served a cease and desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon, something the developer said is &quot;based on distorted claims&quot;. As a result, Dark and Darker was removed from Steam.


At this time, Ironamce asked for &quot;understanding&quot; as it worked to get the game back on the site, noting that &quot;due to the sensitive legal nature of this issue&quot; it has to be &quot;careful with [its] statements so as to not jeopardise [its] position&quot;.

Entitling the tweet &quot;introducing a closer look at the world of Valisthea in Final Fantasy 16&quot;, a video gives us almost two minutes&#x27; worth of Valisthea&#x27;s stunning environments, from sandy deserts and rugged clifftops to striking waterfalls and lush green meadows. 

But why read about it when you can see it for yourself? Check out the brief video below:

                              <span>It looks like Dead Cells is getting a native PS5 release that bundles in its Return to Castlevania DLC.

Whilst not formally confirmed, the game – called Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania Edition, unsurprisingly enough – popped up on the US Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), clearly marked as coming to PS5 (thanks, Gematsu).

Right now, we&#x27;re unclear if it&#x27;s a digital release or if we&#x27;ll get a physical version, too, but it&#x27;ll be good news nonetheless for PlayStation 5 owners who want to experience a native Dead Cells adventure, rather than via the backwards-compatible PS4 version which released five years ago.

                              <span>Action-RPG Duel Corp is now available in early access (EA) on Steam.

The game – which boasts the curious conceit that you can play alone and then later with a friend – launched in early access yesterday, and will be available as an open playtest between now and 4th April.

Like other games released in EA, the two-person development team says the plan is to &quot;make sure that Duel Corp turns into a well-rounded product for full release&quot; when &quot;it&#x27;s the complete experience we want it to be&quot;. Consequently, the team believes the game will be in early access &quot;for about one year&quot;.

The conference - self-described as &quot;the game industry&#x27;s premiere professional event, championing game developers and the advancement of their craft&quot; – ran between 20th and 24th March in San Francisco, California. As the event drew to a close, however, attendees began sharing concerning stories about their experiences at the event.

&quot;Women at GDC this year have been belittled and undermined in their roles, been hit on relentlessly, and had their drinks spiked by predatory men,&quot; tweeted developer Leena van Deventer (thanks, TheGamer).

That adds up to a staggering 16.3 billion hours played across PC and consoles by players living in 242 different countries.

&quot;The PUBG community has expanded and changed over the past six years, resulting in priceless memories, thrilling updates, and amazing gameplay experiences - with many more still to come,&quot; publisher Krafton said, confirming that the shooter generated 75 million sales before the game went free-to-play.

Gran Turismo producer, Kazunori Yamauchi, confirmed they were coming in a cheeky tweet that showed the five vehicles in deep shadow, telling us only that the update was coming &quot;next week&quot;, and reminding us that it&#x27;s &quot;cherry blossom season in Tokyo&quot;.

As is usually the case, fans have already forensically examined the teaser image, and reckon it includes the new Mazda 3, and possibly a Panamera Sport Turismo or an Audi RS5 DTM.

                              <span>The term &quot;Left4Dead3&quot; has reportedly popped up in CS2 files.

Dubbed &quot;version 2&quot;, the reference secreted in the files states that whilst the severity of Left4Dead3 is &quot;high&quot; – whatever that means – the priority is &quot;none&quot;, which comes as no surprise to many of the commenters on Steam&#x27;s subreddit page.

Whispers of a new Left 4 Dead title have been heard from several sources for several years now. Back in December 2019, Valve News Network&#x27;s well-connected Tyler McVicker told Twitter followers that &quot;Left 4 Dead VR is real&quot;, while in January 2020, Chinese HTC president Alvin Wang Graylin shared slides from a VR presentation making mention of Left 4 Dead 3.

                              <span>Spoiler warning for God of War Ragnarok&#x27;s late-game story!


With much of the final, climactic level in place and the last few visual effects coming in, the developers at Sony Santa Monica realised they had a bit of a problem: there&#x27;s a big plot development that happens here, essential to the entire story of God of War Ragnarok - but nobody who played the game would notice it.


The moment in question here is Atreus&#x27; big realisation, that bringing about Ragnarok is, after all, maybe not the best idea - something he notices when dwarven companion Sindri sets off a kind of magical shockwave, which destroys the Asgardian villains&#x27; defences but, also, takes out a good few innocent civilians, too.

                              <span>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has smashed its all-time concurrent PC user peak. Yes, again.

Clocking up a record 1.5 million concurrent players earlier today (thanks, SteamDB), that means CS:GO now sports Steam&#x27;s second-biggest concurrent players record ever.

Whilst it still has some ways to go to take the top spot – pole position holder PUBG Battlegrounds&#x27; concurrent record is twice as high at CS:GO&#x27;s at 3.2 million – it&#x27;s an incredible feat for a decade-old shooter.

                              <span>Games writer and designer, Chris Avellone, has reportedly settled a lawsuit after two women accused him of sexual misconduct. 

The settlement dismisses the claims levied against him &quot;with prejudice&quot;, &quot;pursuant to a confidential settlement&quot;. Avellone claims the settlement includes a &quot;seven-figure payment&quot;, which includes &quot;the return&quot; of his legal fees.

After &quot;engaging with Mr. Avellone&quot;, Karissa Barrows and Kelly Rae Bristol issued a joint statement, which was published on Avellone&#x27;s personal blog earlier today:

                              <span>Fan-favourite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, is getting a video game adaptation.

Paramount Global senior VP Doug Rosen confirmed to Polygon that the third-person action-RPG adaptation will be &quot;a darker, more mature take&quot; on the TMNT IP, reportedly likening the game to Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War games. 

According to Rosen, the game will follow a single Turtle – in the comic, it&#x27;s Michaelangelo – although it may be possible to play as others, including perhaps other notable characters like April and Splinter, in flashbacks.

                              <span>Dark and Darker has been removed from Steam after developer Ironmace received a cease and desist demand from Korean publisher Nexon.

Fans first noticed changes being made to the RPG&#x27;s Steam store page overnight, when assets like videos and screenshots were quietly removed. Then they realised that online co-op and PvP had stopped working, followed by the complete removal of all traces of the game. Now, if you attempt to load the game&#x27;s Steam store, it&#x27;ll take you to Steam&#x27;s front page.

&quot;To all our fans, we have recently been served a cease and desist letter and DMCA takedown by Nexon regarding Dark and Darker based on distorted claims,&quot; Ironmace explained via the community&#x27;s Discord server (thanks, Reddit).
