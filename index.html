Deleting objects in Kubernetes can be challenging. You may think you’ve deleted something, only to find it still persists. While issuing a kubectl delete command and hoping for the best might work for day-to-day operations, understanding how Kubernetes delete commands operate will help you understand why some objects linger after deletion.
In this post, I’ll look at:
What properties of a resource govern deletion
How finalizers and owner references impact object deletion

It wasn&#x27;t quite the infamous stim glitch, but the end result was similar, as this time players found an exploit that allowed them to create unbreakable gas masks. Thankfully, this particular method has now been patched out by Raven. 
In your average game of Warzone, masks are supposed to degrade when you sit outside the ring, eventually breaking so that you start taking damage from the gas (and die). Some players figured out a way to glitch…</span>

Fortnite fans do not typically get to see the battle royale&#x27;s eye-catching characters until they&#x27;re added to the game&#x27;s files - and even then, some are encrypted so they&#x27;re a complete surprise until they go on sale. 
However, a new player survey has spilled onto the internet via LeakySussed - and among questions about the game itself there are dozens of unrevealed characters for fans to offer feedback on.

                    <span>Destiny 2&#x27;s new transmog system to change the appearance of items has come under further fire from fans, following its general release. 
In the run up to its long-awaited launch, players despaired at the announcement of its grind-heavy mechanics. Now it&#x27;s actually out in the wild, the criticism has continued. 
Chief among the complaints is the fact that Synthstrand, the base tier of three transmog currencies, appears to be time-gated.

                    <span>Mass Effect Legendary Edition features BioWare&#x27;s full trilogy in its most accessible form yet - but it also lets you pick and choose to play individual games. 
Perhaps you just want to play Mass Effect 3? Or maybe you want to start with ME2, as the series fleshes out its roster of characters, and skip ME1&#x27;s Mako?
Well, all of this - as it always did - plays into the trilogy&#x27;s big finale. Avoiding spoilers, it&#x27;s worth remembering that whatever Shepard&#x27;s own individual choices might be, these choices are also…</span>

                    <span>Blizzard has lowered the price of a cloned World of Warcraft Classic character following a backlash from players.
The company was set to charge $35 per character for an optional cloning service, which would let players keep playing the original World of Warcraft Classic content and The Burning Crusade content with the same character.
The $35 (around £25) price was roundly criticised by the World of Warcraft community as being too expensive - and Blizzard came under fire accordingly.

Publisher 505 Games and lead developer One More Level have announced that Ghostrunner 2 is currently in development, and will release on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. As of yet there&#x27;s no release date for the sequel, so we may be waiting a while to slide around its neon-lit streets.

In the video, Katy Perry and her Pikachu reminisce about growing up - and we see flashbacks to when she was younger and Pikachu was just a Pichu. Pokémon evolve, and so do people too! I think that&#x27;s the message here. 
It&#x27;s no Pokérap, but you can watch it anyway below:

                    <span>Since its announcement back at BlizzCon 2019, Overwatch 2&#x27;s pre-release marketing has predominantly focussed on its new bits - which is to say its story campaign and co-op modes. PvP&#x27;s still a major part of the package, of course, and Blizzard will finally be giving Overwatch 2&#x27;s competitive multiplayer an airing more of an airing next week.
That&#x27;s according to Overwatch game director Aaron Keller, making his Developer Update video debut following Jeff Kaplan&#x27;s departure from Blizzard last month.

Bandai Namco has announced the demo will first land on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on 21st May, with PlayStation 4 and PS5 following on 28th May. There&#x27;s no news on whether the demo is coming to PC, so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see if it comes to the platform.

                    <span>Microsoft has released a new dynamic theme for Xbox Series X/S which brings to life the retro, Matrix-inspired aesthetic of the OG Xbox. 
The animated background, named &quot;The Original&quot;, is more akin to the loading animation you got when first turning on that chunky console rather than its actual dashboard, but the look will likely still feel familiar. 
Here&#x27;s The Verge&#x27;s Tom Warren with a preview - though it should now be rolling out to all Xbox Series X/S owners:

                    <span>Ever since the new generation of consoles released at the end of last year, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles have suffered from stock shortages - and as a result of that, increased levels of scalping. The problem grew so severe that even British politicans began to pay attention. And with console shortages set to continue for the foreseeable future, it seems Microsoft is trialling a new way for customers to acquire a console - without everything being ruined by scalper bots.

Reports of Destiny 2 crossplay being possible emerged last night, and were picked up by Destiny community manager Cozmo. 
Describing it as an unintended &quot;sneak peek&quot;, Bungie said that crossplay was officially still in development, and would be disabled again in the coming days.

As its name implies, HTC&#x27;s Vive Pro 2 is the direct successor to the high-end PC VR headset it released in 2018. It&#x27;ll up the ante with a 5K resolution display (2448x2448 pixels per eye), a 120-degree field of view, and a 120Hz panel. By way of contrast, the original Vive Pro featured a 2880x1600 resolution, a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate.

                    <span>EA Play Live, the publisher&#x27;s big annual announcement show, will be held this year on 22nd July. 
That&#x27;s a month later than 2021&#x27;s digital-only E3 event, which is dated for 12th to 15th June. 
EA has not been a major part of E3 for years, instead opting to hold its own EA Play events elsewhere. E3 is traditionally held at the Los Angeles Convention Centre, while in recent years EA has housed its own show at the same time a few miles away up in Hollywood.

                    <span>The application, simply named Calculator, launches on the Nintendo Switch eShop tomorrow,12th May, priced £8.09.
Calculator is a third-party app, not made by Nintendo, and one of the rare few non-gaming applications to make it onto the eShop. Of course, some people do find maths fun - perhaps even a game! I am not one of these people.

                    <span>Reverse-engineered GTA code was restored after its developer filed a DMCA counterclaim on GitHub.
TorrentFreak reports GitHub restored a fork of the fan-made re3 project after its creator filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown counter-claim.
As Eurogamer reported in February, the Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City reverse-engineering fan project known as re3 was hit by a DMCA filed by Rockstar parent company Take-Two that claimed copyright infringement.

                    <span>Fortnite looks ready to launch its sandbox survival mode, Daybreak, according to files added in today&#x27;s new 16.40 patch. 
We&#x27;ve seen glimpses of Daybreak before, in leaked files from previous patches and also, intriguingly, via internal documentation released as part of the ongoing Apple v Epic trial, dated from last year. This suggested it has been in the works for quite some time, and was set to arrive a lot sooner.

THERE MAY BE RESIDENT EVIL VILLAGE SPOILERS AHEAD.
Mini Me Chris is one of the more eye-catching mods, simply because of how nightmarish it is. Modder JTeghius Kittius said: &quot;This was a dumb joke that popped into my head so I had to do this.&quot;

                    <span>Respawn recently reassured players that it was exploring &quot;every avenue&quot; to take down Apex Legends cheaters - legal action being one of them - and it seems one high-profile cheater is already facing something worse than the ban hammer. Prolific cheater Tufi, who some in the Apex Legends community have described as a &quot;God&quot; and &quot;unbannable&quot; cheater, is apparently facing some form of legal action from Respawn - although details remain light on exactly how far this has progressed.

The PC version of the Blood Angels versus Tyranids turn-based strategy game was due out in May, with the console versions to follow in the summer. But Slitherine is now going for a joined-up launch across all platforms in July.
Battlesector is developed by Black Lab Games, maker of the well-received Battlestar Galactica Deadlock. It&#x27;s described as &quot;battle-scale&quot;, and based on gam…</span>

                    <span>It was inevitable: the appropriateness of Fortnite&#x27;s bizarre banana man Peely has now been discussed in open court.
Last night, in the ongoing Apple v Epic trial, Peely came under scrutiny for being a naked piece of fruit with arms and legs.
In remarks transcribed from the courtroom by Verge reporter Adi Robertson, a lawyer for Apple brought up Peely in court and made a deal of showing the character wearing clothes (his Chapter 2 Season 2 Bond-esque Agent Peely tuxedo).

In the UK, Village is already the second-highest UK boxed debut this year, beaten only by Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury, and has set franchise records for concurrent players on Steam.

                    <span>Activision has offered a glimpse at Rambo in Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops Cold War.
The official Call of Duty Twitter account released a short clip showing Rambo preparing to unleash a fire arrow from his trademark bow at an unfortunate victim, alongside the tagline: &quot;Become war.&quot;
Rambo arrives on 20th May as part of the mid-season update for Season 3 - no doubt as a costly soldier skin.

                    <span>A movie director has accused Capcom of copying one of his monsters for a Resident Evil Village boss fight.
Dutch director Richard Raaphorst said the Sturm boss found in the recently-released Resident Evil Village is a &quot;one-to-one&quot; copy of a monster he created for his 2013 found footage horror film Frankenstein&#x27;s Army.
Capcom failed to comment by press time.

ValheimRAFT is a mod by Sarcen that allows players to construct their own ships rather than simply use the pre-made ones available in vanilla Valheim. (If the name didn&#x27;t give it away, it&#x27;s inspired by the game Raft, a survival game in which you construct a boat from bits of debris.)

The company&#x27;s CFO, Hiroki Totoki, said Sony will struggle to meet demand even with a supply boost, Bloomberg reported (paywall).
As most know, the PS5 is incredibly hard to buy at the moment, with stock snapped up as soon as it goes on sale. The console has also been the focus of scalpers, who sell on for an inflated price.

                    <span>Registration to participate in the closed beta for Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming battle royale, Final Fantasy 7 The First Soldier, is now open.
Prospective players have from now until 27th May 2021 to register their interest, although right now, the beta is restricted to players with 64-bit, 7.1+ Android phones with at least 3GB of memory available.
As is usually the case with these things, registering does not guarantee you a spot in the closed beta, but the sign-up page hints that it wants &quot;tons of players&quot; to g…</span>

                    <span>A new rumour purports two new DualSense controllers could be coming to market &quot;very soon&quot;.
According to AreaJugones - a Spanish-language site that has previously correctly leaked a PlayStation Plus freebie lineup ahead of confirmation from PlayStation - the new colour schemes deviate from the current white and black scheme to include shades of red and grey. 
Without photographic evidence, it&#x27;s not possible to know precisely how the colours will be used, or what parts of the controller will be more colourful…</span>

                    <span>Respawn has seemingly nerfed Wattson&#x27;s electrified fence in Apex Legends.
As spotted and shared by Twitterer LilakeyLK, it looks as though the latest season has not only introduced a new Legend and competitive mode Arenas, but it&#x27;s also made a tweak to one of Wattson&#x27;s key defences... with an emphasis on &quot;fence&quot;.
Previously, running into Wattson&#x27;s fence would slow down an opposing player, but now it looks as though the slowdown and corresponding stun has been removed, essentially making the fence useless (t…</span>

Activision even created a website for a fictional air conditioning repair company called Nakatomi Duct Cleaning, offering its services in Verdansk.
The website says &quot;A NAKATOMI CORP DIVISION MASTERING A/C DUCT CLEANING SINCE 1988&quot;, but the current Warzone map is set in 1984. Nah... I&#x27;m applying too much logic…</span>

Local press reported the strange image on Monday, 3rd May after it popped up overnight - and seemingly had no idea what it was about or who made it.
Its true nature was revealed when Resident Evil Village came out on Friday - it was a Capcom PR stunt. And a pretty cool one, I&#x27;ll admit.

GPUnity&#x27;s texture pack mod began life soon after Nier: Automata launched on PC in March 2017. They&#x27;ve continued to work on the mod since then, and now, four years later, released the final version.
Nier: Automata&#x27;s PC version is infamous for a raft of technical issues that were fixed by modders, including a constant stutter tick due to the game running at around 59 frames per second (this is something explored …</span>

It seemed an odd omission - Tojo Dojo noticed the Yakuza spin-off sequel was briefly listed as coming to PC on the official countdown website that was home to the Lost Judgment announcement. Even after mention of PC was removed from the website, fans spotted mention of the Steam logo in the Lost Judgment website source code.

The re-release of the much-loved 20 year-old action RPG went ahead as planned yesterday on Xbox One, where it costs a pricey £29.99, and PlayStation 4, where for some reason it costs a fiver cheaper at £24.99.
But even though the official Black Isle Studios Twitter page said yesterday that the Switch version would arrive in a couple of hours, the game failed to materialise on the Nintendo eShop.

In October 2019, speedrunner Cash Mayo set an incredible time of 11.7 seconds, shaving a fraction off Mayo&#x27;s previous world record of 11.9 seconds:

It saw 101,726 peak concurrents on launch day, 7th May.
That makes Capcom&#x27;s latest comfortably the biggest PC launch for any Resident Evil game. According to SteamCharts, Resident Evil 7 managed an all-time peak of 18,211 concurrents, Resident Evil 6 peaked with 11,836, and the most recent release, the Resident Evil 3 remake, hit 32,635. Only the Resident Evil 2 remake, which saw a concurrents peak of 74,024, comes close.

                    <span>A town in Japan built a giant squid statue with its COVID relief grant.
One local told the Chunichi Shimbun newspaper that while the statue may be effective in the long run, the money could have been used for “urgent support,” such as for medical staff and long-term care facilities.
But a spokesperson for the town told Fuji News Network that the statue would be a tourist attraction and part of a long term strategy to help promote Noto’s famous flying squid.

I am impressed by the town̵…</span>

                    <span>A new draft of an Australian educational curriculum proposes teaching children as young as five cybersecurity:
The proposed curriculum aims to teach five-year-old children — an age at which Australian kids first attend school — not to share information such as date of birth or full names with strangers, and that they should consult parents or guardians before entering personal information online.
Six-and-seven-year-olds will be taught how to use usernames and passwords, and the pitfalls of click…</span>

Kubernetes 1.21 marks the graduation of the metrics stability framework and along with it, the first officially supported stable metrics. Not only do stable metrics come with supportability guarantees, the metrics stability framework brings escape hatches that you can use if you encounter problematic metrics.

Graceful node shutdown, beta in 1.21, enables kubelet to gracefully evict pods during a node shutdown.
Kubernetes is a distributed system and as such we need to be prepared for inevitable failures — nodes will fail, containers might crash or be restarted, and - ideally - your workloads will be able to withstand these catastrophic events.

Have you ever been asked to troubleshoot a failing Kubernetes service and struggled to find basic information about the service such as the source repository and owner?
One of the problems as Kubernetes applications grow is the proliferation of services. As the number of services grows, developers start to specialize working with specific services. When it comes to troubleshooting, however, developers need to be able to find the source, understand the service and dependen…</span>

Once you have containerized a non-parallel Job,
it is quite easy to get it up and running on Kubernetes without modifications to
the binary. In most cases, when running parallel distributed Jobs, you had
to set a separate system to partition the work among the workers. For
example, you could set up a task queue to assign one work item to each
Pod or multiple items
to each Pod until the queue is emptied.
The Kubernetes 1.21 release introduces a new field to control Job comp…</span>
