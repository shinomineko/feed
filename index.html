                              <span>The pilot episode of a scrapped Kingdom Hearts animated series has been uploaded to YouTube by its proposed director.

The series was set to be directed and developed by Seth Kearsley, whose other credits include Eight Crazy Nights and The Looney Tunes Show.

In 2002, the same year as the release of the original Kingdom Hearts game, Kearsley was hired by Disney TV for the series. Although the pilot tested &quot;exceptionally well&quot;, it was canned due to Square Enix&#x27;s future plans for &quot;many more games&quot; in the series.

In response to continued questions over whether Microsoft owning Call of Duty would unfairly hobble PlayStation, Microsoft claimed that every COD player on PlayStation could move over to Xbox, and Sony&#x27;s playerbase would still remain &quot;significantly larger&quot; than its own. 


Microsoft does not go into detail on its mental arithmetic here, but does note elswhere in its comments that PlayStation currently has a console install base of 150 million, compared to Xbox&#x27;s install base of 63.7 million.

Modder DJ_Kovrik has created the Wannabe Edgerunner mod that adds in the Humanity stat.


Essentially, every piece of cyberware has a Humanity Cost that gradually drives your character towards cyberpsychosis.

Meanwhile, the story will follow a &quot;group of strangers&quot; doing what they can to negotiate the &quot;dangers of Night City&quot;. Something of which, we all know, there are many.

                              <span>The next update for Warner Bros.&#x27; brawler MultiVersus is here, and with it has brought the, quite frankly terrifying, gremlin Stripe along with a host of Halloween themed cosmetics. 


Stripe&#x27;s arrival follows that of fellow Gremlins alum Gizmo. Unlike Gizmo, however, Stripe will wield a chainsaw - you know, for those times when you want to go full Ash Williams. 


Stripe&#x27;s standard look is unlockable with either 2000 Gold, one Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium. If you fancy something a little bit more Rambo-like, you can unlock his Combat Stripe variant with 800 Gleamium.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 battle royale The First Soldier will shut down in January next year.


The game was first released in November 2021, meaning its shelf life was a little over 12 months.


News of its end was announced on Twitter: &quot;Despite all our efforts to bring you regular updates with fresh and exciting content, we haven&#x27;t been able to deliver the experience that we were hoping to, and that you all deserve, so we have made the extremely tough decision to end service for Final Fantasy 7 The First Soldier.&quot;

                              <span>Facebook parent company Meta has snaffled up several developers, including ReCore maker Armature Studio, to fold into its own Oculus Studios brand. 


Armature will be joined as part of Meta by LocoCycle and &#x27;Splosion Man developer Twisted Pixel Games, as well as Marvel&#x27;s Iron Man VR company Camouflaj. 


Meta made the acquisition announcements last night as part of its Meta Connect event, where it also confirmed a partnership with Xbox Cloud Gaming to see Microsoft&#x27;s game streaming tech arrive on Quest VR headsets. The new £1500 Quest Pro headset was also given an official unveiling - after an early unit recently turned up in a hotel.

                              <span>Researchers have used thermal cameras and ML guessing techniques to recover passwords from measuring the residual heat left by fingers on keyboards. From the abstract:
We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</span>

                              <span>Developer Volition has detailed its Saints Row reboot&#x27;s first major update, saying that while it would have &quot;preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions&quot; at this juncture, it will initially be prioritising &quot;improvements over new features&quot;.


Saints Row released to a middling reception in August, with its enjoyable open-world zaniness rather dampened by its considerable number of bugs. It&#x27;s these that Volition hopes to address in its first major post-launch update in November, explaining in a new blog post, &quot;We know there is still work to do to improve your experience in the game.&quot;


&quot;We are supporting Saints Row for the long-term,&quot; it insisted, &quot;and while we&#x27;d have preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions, right now we feel the focus must be on telling you how we&#x27;re going to improve the... experience for all players in 2022 and beyond.&quot;

                              <span>Rather than launching a new Call of Duty title in 2023, Activision is reportedly planning to instead release a premium expansion including new &quot;campaign content&quot; for Modern Warfare 2.


Word of new paid campaign DLC for Modern Warfare 2 was initially shared by Call of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope, who claimed it would arrive in the game&#x27;s second year (ie. 2023) and would be bundled with a 20th anniversary &quot;greatest hits map pack&quot; containing classic maps from the original 2009 Modern Warfare 2, as well as maps from across the series.


Following TheGhostofHope&#x27;s campaign DLC claims, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier stepped in to corroborate the news. &quot;Next year [Activision Blizzard will] be selling new stuff for MW2&quot;, he wrote in a tweet, &quot;an expansion or something like that&quot;. Although Schreier admitted he wasn&#x27;t &quot;sure exactly what it&#x27;ll look like&quot;, he claimed it would have &quot;campaign stuff too&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft and Meta have announced a partnership that will see Xbox Cloud Gaming come to Quest VR headsets at some currently unspecified future point.


Xbox Cloud Gaming gives Game Pass Ultimate subscribers the ability to stream and play a steadily growing number of titles on a range of Android, Apple, and Windows devices, as well as Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox consoles, and eventually, Microsoft&#x27;s dedicated Keystone device. 


And that list, as revealed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during today&#x27;s Meta Connect event, will grow to include Quest VR head sets via the Meta Quest Store.

                              <span>Ahead of its launch next spring, EA has offered a first look at its previously announced &quot;next generation&quot; PGA Tour game for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.


EA Sports PGA Tour - the publisher&#x27;s first foray into golfing sims since 2015&#x27;s Rory McIlroy PGA Tour - was officially unveiled back in March last year, promising to deliver world famous golf courses and professional golfers as part of a long-term deal with the PGA Tour.


One year-long delay later, EA Sports PGA Tour is shuffling ever-closer to release, and EA&#x27;s first major reveal for the game comes in the form of a 30-second teaser trailer.

                              <span>On 20th October, Phantom Abyss will be rope-swinging its way onto Xbox Game Pass.


Along with this announcement, we also have a nice shiny new trailer from Devolver Digital to mark the occasion. This trailer, which you can see below, shows off some of the extreme temple runs that you as the player will have to navigate.  


This &quot;massive asynchronous multiplayer&quot; will throw players into those temples seen above and task them with retrieving ancient relics from within. There will be hidden traps to account for, and, as with all good temple exploration, there will of course be guardians that will do everything in their power to stop players from reaching their goal.

A new gameplay video shared on Twitter shows the customisation options, urging players to &quot;get noticed&quot;.


It&#x27;s all part of the game&#x27;s visual style that marries realistic vehicles with colourful, animated street art.

                              <span>Are standard Xbox controllers a little too ordinary for your tastes? Then perhaps Microsoft&#x27;s has the answer with its newly revealed - and purportedly &quot;surreal&quot; - Lunar Shift special edition affair.


In what way, you might reasonably be wondering,  is the Lunar Shift Special Edition Wireless Controller &quot;surreal&quot;? Is it perhaps formed from the whisper of a backward-speaking entity in a red-curtain-clad room? Does it droop provocatively across surfaces like a slowly melting pocket watch? Does it wear a snazzy top hat and rain in multitudes?


Alas, none of those things; the Lunar Shift&#x27;s big gimmick is that - in a similar colour-changing fashion to last year&#x27;s Aqua Shift controller - it shifts from silver to gold as it catches the light. This, says, Microsoft, gives it a &quot;stylised, smokey atmosphere&quot;.

                              <span>Shipments of PS5 consoles to the US in September had a 400 percent increase year-over-year, according to a financial analyst.

David Gibson, senior analyst at MST Financial, shared a graph on Twitter showing the imports to the US per month from June 2021 onwards, with a huge spike during last month.

Gibson added he believes some of the stock will go towards the launch of God of War Ragnarök, which makes a lot of sense. Ragnarök is the next first-party title for PlayStation, and Sony will be undoubtedly eager to capitalise on its release to bolster sales of the PS5.

                              <span>There have been some rumblings that Sony, along with developer Naughty Dog, decided to release its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for the PlayStation 5 (and eventually PC) to capitalise on the upcoming HBO series inspired by the game.
However, PlayStation head Hermen Hulst has made it known that this is not the case. Well, at least, it is not entirely the case.
Chatting to Axios, Hulst stated that the initial 2013 release of The Last of Us was &quot;a little ahead of its time in terms of its creative vision&quot;. Hulst claimed that the limitations of technology at this time meant that Naughty Dog&#x27;s ideas ultimately had to be dialled back a notch or two.

                              <span>Earlier this month, high-profile modder Lance McDonald announced that the PlayStation 5 had been &quot;jailbroken&quot;.
Now, following the discovery of this jailbreaking exploit, McDonald has been rifling around in the files for both BluePoint&#x27;s Demon&#x27;s Souls remake and those of the elusive Abandoned from developer Blue Box Game Studio.

When having a closer look at those files for Demon&#x27;s Souls, McDonald came across a rather endearing and fun inclusion by developer BluePoint Games. It turns out that there are 3D model files for the one and only &#x27;Ring of the Chieftain&#x27; tucked away in the PS5 remake.

As part of The Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC, out on 28th October, Mercenaries mode will be getting more content, and we&#x27;ll finally be able to play as the lady herself.

But in order to accomodate her stature, the development team had to make a small compromise on her height.

                              <span>Following Overwatch 2&#x27;s fairly shambolic release that involved targeted DDoS attacks, Blizzard has reported interruptions this week to Battle.net via a further DDOS attack, causing login issues. 


In addition, Overwatch 2&#x27;s character roster has had to be downsized a tad to allow Blizzard to &quot;iron out a few bugs&quot;. Unfortunately for the developer, however, this has created a new bug of its own, resulting in even more characters becoming inaccessible for some Overwatch 2 players.


On the official customer support Twitter account, Blizzard addressed the DDoS attack faced by Battle.net yesterday. This has reportedly now all been dealt with, however it managed to cause widespread issues for players of both Overwatch 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

                              <span>Interesting research: “ImpNet: Imperceptible and blackbox-undetectable backdoors in compiled neural networks, by Tim Clifford, Ilia Shumailov, Yiren Zhao, Ross Anderson, and Robert Mullins:
Abstract: Early backdoor attacks against machine learning set off an arms race in attack and defence development. Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</span>

                              <span>Square Enix Montréal - the developer behind the likes of Hitman Go and Lara Croft Go - has rebranded as Studio Onoma following its acquisition by Embracer Group in May.


Square Enix Montréal was one of three studios purchased by Embracer Group as part of a $300m USD deal with Square Enix earlier this year. Following the deal&#x27;s completion in August, Embracer now also owns Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal, alongside major IPs including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain.


While Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal will keep their existing identities following the Embracer acquisition, Square Enix Montréal has now shaken off the last remnants of its former owner with a new name and new logo, both of which have been detailed in a lengthy post on the developer&#x27;s website. The key takeway for the curious, though, is that &quot;Onoma is Greek for name and names offer endless possibilities&quot;.

                              <span>Phil Spencer&#x27;s shelf is at it again. Ever since it was discovered the Xbox boss had secreted an Xbox Series S in plain sight behind him during a video interview months before the console was announced, fans have been scouring his furnishings for teases of more future reveals - and speculation is now mounting that Spencer has just revealed Microsoft&#x27;s long-in-the-works Xbox Game Pass streaming device on Twitter.


Spencer shared his latest shelf photo earlier today, writing, &quot;Vault Boy left the shelter and stopped by my office to celebrate the Fallout 25th Anniversary.&quot; Conspicuously, though, the Vault Boy statue that&#x27;s supposedly the focus of the tweet is far from the focus of the image. Instead, the photo continues several shelves upward, revealing a mysterious Xbox-branded box fans have so far struggled to identify - and which many are speculating might be the Xbox game-streaming box, codenamed Keystone, announced in 2021.


As described by Microsoft in an update on the project in May, the as-yet-unseen Keystone is intended to be a low-cost device enabling users to play Xbox Cloud Gaming titles through any TV or monitor without the need for a console. Reports on its exact nature have varied - some claimed it was a stick-like dongle, others a box - but whatever it was previously, Microsoft said it was &#x27;pivoting away&#x27; from the then-current iteration to refocus on &quot;a new approach&quot;.

                              <span>Twitch has responded to its controversial decision not to amend its revenue split for streamers.


At present, that split is 50/50 between Twitch and streamers, unlike key competition like YouTube that favours streamers with a 70/30 split. In a lengthy blog post last month, Twitch explained why it won&#x27;t be amending this.



Then, at TwitchCon San Diego during the Patch Notes livestream, Twitch addressed the issue once again.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 had its closed beta test over the weekend, giving lucky fans a taster of what the game will have to offer when it releases.

Players were also able to use the in-game character creation to make a custom fighter for the closed beta and so, unsurprisingly, people decided to experiment and see how far they could push those polygons.

And boy, did you all push them.

Quantic Lab came under scruntiny in June when a YouTube video uploaded by channel Upper Echelon Gamers contained details of mismanagement and malpractice at the company while it was helping with development on Cyberpunk 2077. 

The allegations, shared with Upper Echelon Gamers by whistleblowers, were brushed off by Quantic Lab CEO and founder Stefan Seicarescu at the time.

This port from Simon Brown, aka DrBeef, features motion controlled lightsabers and the ability to deflect oncoming blasts - perfect for all your Storm Trooper slicing and dicing needs. I feel compelled to write something about how &quot;I thought they smelled bad on the outside...&quot; here.


Known as Jedi Knight: Quest, this first-person taster offers an amusing (and a very satisfying looking) way to make one&#x27;s way through that beloved galaxy far, far away.

If you head on over to the phone notifications page on the Battle.net support site, you will see the text stating that those playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, or those with &quot;newly created Overwatch 2 accounts, and newly created Call of Duty: Modern Warfare accounts&quot;, will be  required to add a phone number to access the game. 


The page continues: &quot;Adding a phone number will allow Blizzard Entertainment to send you notifications when important changes are made to your account. Any mobile phone in a supported country with a data plan, and that is not prepaid or a VOIP number, can be used with this service&quot; (thanks, PCGamer).

Basically, real programmers are having their resumes copied and co-opted by scammers, who apply for jobs (or, I suppose, get recruited from various job sites), then hire other people with Western looks and language skills are  to impersonate those first people on Zoom job interviews. Presumably, sometimes the scammers get hired and…I suppose…collect paychecks for a while until they get found out and fired. But that requires a bunch of banking fraud as well, so I don’t know...</span>

Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures&#x27; Illumination animation division. It sees Chris Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.

As shared on the Overwatch subreddit community, Dracyoshi reports that whilst &quot;chatting with some friends while browsing the hero gallery&quot;, the game &quot;unexpectedly began unlocking Junnker Queen&#x27;s Plutonium skin&quot;.

                              <span>Bella Ramsey – who plays Ellie in HBO&#x27;s upcoming The Last of Us TV adaptation - was advised not to play the game ahead of joining the show.

During her audition for the part, Ramsey was asked if she&#x27;d played any of Naughty Dog&#x27;s critically-acclaimed game. When she answered honestly - &quot;nope&quot; - she was apparently &quot;encouraged&quot; not to.

&quot;I was actually encouraged not to,&quot; Ramsey told USA Today. &quot;After my first audition, they asked me, &#x27;Have you played it?&#x27; And I said &#x27;nope&#x27;, and they said, &#x27;Keep it that way&#x27;.

                              <span>It looks like the long-awaited System Shock remake will finally release on Steam in March 2023. 

Though not formally confirmed by the developer Nightdive Studios, Steam has updated the game&#x27;s store listing to reveal a March 2023 release date and pre-orders are now open. 

The upcoming release was also spotted and shared by industry insider, Wario64, although some commenters were unsure if this is a real, concrete release date or just an end-of-year placeholder. Guess we&#x27;ll find out in March, eh?

Although we already knew that the ports were on the way, we finally have a firm release date; in a tweet posted to Twitter earlier today, publisher Atlus revealed that the two games will be coming to current- and last-gen systems, as well as PC and Switch, on 19th January, 2023.

Specifically, P4G is coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC Windows, PS4, and Nintendo Switch, whilst P3P is coming to the same, but will also be availa ble on Steam, too.

                              <span>Amazon Games has outlined its plan for MMO Lost Ark with a new development roadmap. 

From now until the end of the year, the team is hoping to introduce three new raids - Mystic Abyss Vycas Legion, and Achates Trial Guardian - as well the Reaper Advanced class in November, and the Summoner Advanced class in December.  

&quot;The next few months mark the road to the Brelshaza Legion Raid — one of the most challenging, unique, and beautifully dangerous raids in all of Lost Ark,&quot; the team explains.

                              <span>PUBG: Battlegrounds&#x27; next update will &quot;refine the gunplay meta&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to developer Krafton, which says update 20.1 – which goes live on 11th October for PC and 19th for consoles and introduces a new ranked season – includes &quot;several improvements to weapon attachments, as well as updates to firing from vehicles, a new ranked season, world and map updates and quality-of-life updates&quot;. 

In response to the Vertical Foregrip &quot;dominating the battlegrounds as the choice grip slot attachment&quot;, the team is changing the Thumbgrip, Angled Foregrip, Halfgrip, Lightweight Grip - and the Vertical Foregrip itself - in a bid to shake things up, promising to &quot;monitor [our] plays after this balance update&quot;.

Yuzu is open-source and, crucially, legal, but as PC Gamer points out, emulation is a sticky topic for some, prompting Valve to upload an emulator-free version of the same video a short while later, which you can see below: 

&quot;Valve&#x27;s new official video for the Steam Deck has a very interesting game icon in it,&quot; industry insider Nibel tweeted yesterday, before following up with: &quot;Update: Valve has removed the original video and reuploaded a new one with a small difference.&quot;

                              <span>Another day, another Silent Hill story: this one purports, yet again, that there are &quot;several teams&quot; working on &quot;several games&quot;, including &quot;the Silent Team&quot; who were around when the first Silent Hill film was made in 2006. 

Christophe Gans, the director of the first Silent Hill movie - who we already knew was reportedly working on a third Silent Hill film - made the surprisingly candid revelations during a recent interview in which he seemingly confirmed the persistent whispers that there&#x27;s more than one Silent Hill game in development, including one by a central internal Konami team.

His interview also definitively confirms that Bloober Team is working on a Silent Hill 2 remake, several games are in development, he hasn&#x27;t worked with Kojima, and he &quot;knows a bit about&quot; the next upcoming game.

                              <span>Ever since the release of Deathloop last year, fans have speculated that the acclaimed time loop shooter was, in fact, set in the same universe as Arkane Studios&#x27; much-loved Dishonored series - and now theorists can given finally themselves a pat on the back and pack away their cork boards: the developer has confirmed it is indeed so.


Creative director Dinga Bakaba broke the news during the latest episode of the Xbox podcast (thanks PC Gamer), confirming that Deathloop is &quot;one of the futures of the Dishonored world.&quot;


When asked directly about the possible connection between the two games, Bakaba explained, &quot;We have a number of systems [that mean] not everyone has seen the same thing [in Deathloop], not everyone has heard the same song hidden somewhere, not everyone has seen every room. So it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after [the third Dishonored game] Death of the Outsider.&quot;

                              <span>It looks like the end of 2022 is going to have more than a whiff of Crash Bandicoot about it. Not only has Activision confirmed an 18th October Steam release date for the well-recieved Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, it seems the publisher might just be gearing up to unveil the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League at this year&#x27;s Game Awards.


All this news comes via a bit of promotional tat Activision has been sending out to influencers and press, taking the form of Crash-themed pizza box with goodies inside.


As detailed in a video by YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh (thanks Games Radar), the promotional pizza box in question comes emblazoned with the words &#x27;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-in Pizza Shack&#x27;, a not too subtle hint that the formerly Battle.net-exclusive PC version of Crash Bandicoot 4 will (as fans had already surmised) soon be making its way to Valve&#x27;s storefront. And to clear up any doubt, that&#x27;s made explicit by an attached label confirming an 18th October Steam release.

                              <span>As the nights start drawing in and the spectre of Halloween looms on the horizon, Planet Zoo is getting just a little bit spooky with the announcement of its new nocturnal-themed Twilight Pack DLC, launching on 18th October.


The big draw of Planet Zoo&#x27;s DLC is always its creature addtions, and the Twilight Pack brings five new nocturnal species: the Racoon, Red Fox, Common Wombat, Striped Skunk, and Egyptian Fruit Bat. The first four of those are free-roaming, meaning you can plop them wherever you please, while the Egyptian Fruit Bat is restricted to a walkthrough exhibit.


Players looking to infuse their zoos with a touch of gothic flair for Halloween can make use of the Twilight Pack&#x27;s 200 new scenery items, ranging from castle-themed building parts - including gargoyles and an imposing portcullis - to glowing pumpkins and cauldrons. Even the flora is getting a bit spooky, with Bristlecone pine trees, ivy, and bioluminescent ghost fungus.

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s big new 4.0 update - now officially titled Waypoint - is finally out in the wild. But while developer Hello Games broke from tradition for this latest releases, revealing some of its additions ahead of launch, the studio has now shared some extremely lengthy patch notes, discussing its contents in considerably more granular detail.


The top-level stuff we already knew about; as Hello Games boss Sean Murray told Eurogamer earlier this week, Waypoint - which arrives alongside a new Switch port for No Man&#x27;s Sky - is less about big new additions and more about major quality of life improvements.


To that end, Hello Games had previously teased a bunch of rejigging and streamlining intended to turn No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s last six years of updates &quot;into a more cohesive whole&quot;, as well as a new, less grindy Relaxed mode, a Survival mode revamp, plus extensive options for custom games.

                              <span>This is a quick public service announcement for those keen to avoid any spoilers for the upcoming release of Gotham Knights.


There are currently some major plot spoilers making their way around the internet, following the apparent early release of the game&#x27;s artbook.


I will not go into details of what they are here, I am sure if you are keen to know more you will be able to find out exactly what it is that has been revealed prematurely, but this leak has caused Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer to take to Twitter to complain about spoilers in general.

In a move that is sure to rile up the gaming community, the three options this time are starter Pokémon: are you grass type, fire type, or water type?


The Splatfest will take place in-game from the 11th November.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Platinum Games made the decision to cease all updates to its beleaguered live service game Babylon&#x27;s Fall, and announced it would be  &quot;terminating the game&#x27;s service&quot; on Tuesday, 28th February 2023. The game itself had received a poor reception across the board, with criticisms ranging from its monetisation model to its £60 price tag.


However, despite the fall of Babylon&#x27;s Fall, the developer is not taking its eyes off any future live service games. 


In an interview with VGC, Platinum Games boss Atsushi Inaba said the team has &quot;learned from this experience [with Babylon&#x27;s Fall]&quot; and it had not &quot;changed [its] future plans or outlook&quot; because of it.

It&#x27;s coming courtesy of Asmodee Entertainment and Dovetail Games, the former being responsible for a number of board game adaptations and the latter developing the likes of Train Sim World 2020.

Luiga, one of the co-founders of the studio ZA/UM, originally stated the three leads had left &quot;involuntarily&quot;.

Designer Robert Kurvitz, one of the developers affected, later confirmed that he, along with writer Helen Hindpere and art director Aleksander Rostov, was no longer working at the studio.

A new QR code was found at the PAX Aus gaming convention, with the enigmatic words &quot;where am I?&quot; written across its front. The code was found next to a poster of the same cryptic silhouette.


Scanning this code then leads to a new website and a picture of, yes, Elle Fanning looking back at you, as you can see below from the shot I took on my phone when I scanned the QR code for myself.

                              <span>Square Enix has warned of an attempted hack of the account management system used in Final Fantasy 14.


A post on the Lodestone blog advises on precautions for guarding against unauthorised account access, including resetting your Square Enix password.



&quot;We are currently experiencing an attack by a third party that is attempting to gain access to the Square Enix Account Management System by using a combination of email addresses and passwords that appear to have been obtained from other online services of other companies,&quot; reads the post.

                              <span>A leak of an advertisement for The Super Mario Bros. Movie reveals Princess Peach for the first time.


Last night, Nintendo showed a teaser trailer for the film, but Peach didn&#x27;t feature at all.


But in McDonalds adverts - most of which have been removed from social media, confirming their legitimacy - Peach is present alongside Mario and Toad.

But this trailer was not only shared in English (the version you can see below). Universal has also been uploading this trailer to its many YouTube channels, meaning we can hear just how Toad, Kamek and the rest of those in the Mushroom Kingdom (that we have seen so far at least) sound in Spanish, Italian and more.


First up, as this one has been garnering a lot of attention on Twitter, here is the French version of Mario making his way to the Mushroom Kingdom. Or, in this case, the Royaume Champignon.

Yerli left Crytek in 2018 after more than two decades, following a turbulent period where the company struggled to stay afloat and left some staff for months without pay.


He&#x27;s now developing Room, software designed to create &quot;lifelike virtual meetings&quot;, built on a new &quot;real-time AI 3D engine&quot;. Yerli is serving as chairman and CEO of its developer, TMRW Foundation.

Koukakis is suing Intellexa.
The lawsuit filed by Koukakis takes aim at Intellexa and its executive, alleging a criminal breach of privacy and communication laws, reports Haaretz. The founder of Intellexa, a former Israeli intelligence commander named Taj Dilian, is listed as one of the defendants in the suit, as is another shareholder, Sara Hemo, and the firm itself. The objective of the suit, Koukakis says, is to spur an investigation to determine whether a criminal indictment should be brought against the defendants...</span>

                              <span>RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, is getting a third paid expansion, titled Biotech - which&#x27;ll be bringing babies, mechanoids, and gene modding when it launches later this month alongside a free content update for all players.


Biotech&#x27;s first big additions come in the form of children and reproduction, with colonists and outsiders able to get pregnant and give birth - either naturally or via technological means.


Once babies grow into children, they can learn through lessons, play, or by watching adults work, with players able to determine their traits and passions every few years. Children given more attention and better education are more likely to become happy and talented adult colonists - but players can alternatively skip the nuturing and use growth vats to pump out soldiers and cheap workers to exploit.

                              <span>After years of behind-the-scenes chatter, Nintendo has shared the first trailer for its Chris-Pratt-starring animated Super Mario movie.


Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures&#x27; Illumination animation division. It sees Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.


Since initial casting details broke last year, all has been largely quiet, but the veil of secrecy has finally been lifted today with the first official teaser trailer, which you can see below.

                              <span>After a year of lengthy, but steadily diminishing, queues to purchase a Steam Deck, Valve has announced its impressive handheld gaming PC is now available without a reservation.


Since last July, Valve has been using a reservation system for Steam Deck orders that first required purchasers to pay a small, deductible sum to join the reservations queue then wait for an invite to make a final purchase. For some time, the wait between the two steps was upward of several months, but the gap has been steadily narrowing as Steam Deck production began to outperform Valve&#x27;s estimates.


Now, some 15 months after reservations for Steam Deck initially opened, Valve has announced the queue has been eradicated. Anyone looking to acquire a Steam Deck can now do so immediately, without needing to wait for an invitation to purchase.

&quot;Since the news of Stadia shutting down,&quot; the company wrote in a statement shared on Twitter, &quot;Bethesda Softworks and ZeniMax Online Studios have been discussing the next steps for our Elder Scrolls Online Stadia players and we appreciate your patience&quot;.


&quot;We are happy to share that our Stadia players will be able to transfer their ESO accounts to PC,&quot; it continued, &quot;bringing with them all of their progress, including but not limited to existing characters, purchased items, achievements, and inventory. Since Stadia players already play ESO on our PC servers, all of their friends and guilds will be waiting for them once they complete the transfer.&quot; Bethesda says it&#x27;ll be sharing details on how to make the transfer soon.

                              <span>Together We Rule, the first major expansion for developer Amplitude Studios&#x27; historical 4X strategy game Humankind, has been given a 9th November release date - and there&#x27;s free play weekend for the base game starting today too.


Together We Rule follows the release of two smaller, culture-focused DLC packs for Humankind - one themed around Africa, the other Latin America - and introduces diplomacy and espionage features intended to &quot;help players see the world in a new light and resolve conflicts differently&quot;.


These include the new Congress of Humankind - giving players the means to vote and decide on global doctrines and arbitrate international conflicts - as well as the new Embassy Quarter. The latter can be used to sign mutually beneficial agreements with other empires or force them into taking specific actions through Leverage - a special currency generated by the expansion&#x27;s new Agent units that can be spent to infiltrate, sabotage, and disinform other empires.

Upon its 11th October release, this expansion will bring a whole new element to your gameplay: Survival against some heinous zombies.


&quot;Just in time for spooky season, Undead adds a mix of survival and horror to Prison Architect that will put Wardens&#x27; management skills to the test,&quot; said game director Gaz Wright. &quot;Grappling with the task of survival is no easy feat, as it introduces an extra layer of complexity and pressure to management gameplay.&quot; You can see a little teaser for this expansion below.

                              <span>When EA released Battlefield 2042 almost 11 months ago, the promise of a live service Battlefield game filled brim with a constant stream of content updates was one of the key selling points.


In fact, the live service model was supposed to be used as a substitute for the traditional story campaign, where in-game events would fill in the lore of the new climate-change ridden world.


But all of that was postponed thanks to dire state of the game at launch. Now almost a year since launch and two seasons later, we finally have our first in-season event and new game mode.

                              <span>A handful of new, unannounced Pokémon have been spotted in the latest trailer.


Earlier today, The Pokémon Company released a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that included around 14 minutes of gameplay.


But at around the 7.17 mark, just as one trainer enters the town of Artazon, a number of new &#x27;mon can be seen on the minimap at the bottom right of the screen.

A USS Enterprise backpack and Beam Me Up celebration will also be available. 


It sounds like all of the above will be available via the game&#x27;s store, save for Spock - you&#x27;ll get him with Fall Guys&#x27; current season pass, alongside a Borg mask. I have to say, I really love these designs.

                              <span>Swedish video game company Starbreeze has announced its return to publishing with an agreement signed with development studio Walking Tree Games to publish its upcoming game: The Tribe Must Survive.


Starbreeze, best known for its development of the Payday series, fell from grace following the disastrous launch of Overkill&#x27;s The Walking Dead on Steam back in 2018.


The game&#x27;s failure led to severe financial issues and the exit of the company&#x27;s boss Bo Andersson. Wesley Yin-Poole produced a full-length feature on the company&#x27;s collapse in 2019 which I recommend you give a thorough read if you want the full context.

                              <span>An update to Spider-Man Remastered on PC lets players link their Steam and PlayStation Network accounts.


Doing so will unlock the Resilient Suit and Concussive Blast Gadget in-game, as well as two skill points. Players will also receive news, updates and offers from PlayStation Studios on PC or PlayStation platforms.


Spider-Man Remastered is the first PlayStation game on PC to offer this option, though it looks like Trophy support isn&#x27;t included. It&#x27;s unclear if previous games will also be updated with this feature, or if it will be included in future releases like Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves.

A survey on the official Twitter feed has asked fans if they would like to be &quot;able to interact with [their] animal companions?&quot;


There are then three options presented for you to choose from. These are: &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;YES&quot; (an important use of all capital letters there for emphasis) or &quot;Yes (in the next update)!&quot;

That tome is called Malevolence and will include memories for Killer Ghost Face and Survivor Mikaela Reid.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing the avalance of announcements to come from CD Projekt Red, maker of The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077.


Taking a leaf out of Ubisoft&#x27;s recent playbook - when it lay the entirety of its Assassin&#x27;s Creed plans on the table - CD Projekt Red has done similar, discussing projects which we&#x27;ll see release across the whole of the next decade. There&#x27;s going to be a new trilogy of new Witcher games, a Cyberpunk sequel, a new IP and various other spin-offs - though there was no word on Cyberpunk&#x27;s standalone multiplayer portion, and still no firm date for The Witcher 3&#x27;s long-awaited current-gen console update.

With questions still to answer about what we&#x27;d known was coming, how likely is it we&#x27;ll see any of these fresh projects soon? And if not, why announce them now? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan share their thoughts.

                              <span>After months of speculation, leaks and rumours, EA has finally revealed the next installment of the Need for Speed in a swanky new trailer. 


Need for Speed Unbound is lush with an anime aesthetic that&#x27;s combined with the grungy street racing vibes of early Need for Speed games. 


The trailer features American rapper A$AP Rocky, who is heard narrating in the beginning of the trailer before finishing off with what appears to be a brand-new track from the rapper.

                              <span>Brazil has approved Microsoft&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


In new documentation issued by the country&#x27;s Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE) on Wednesday, the regulator stated it has approved of this deal &quot;without restrictions&quot;.


Along with this approval, CADE did touch on the more high-profile elements of this proposed acquisition, including Activision&#x27;s Call of Duty franchise - a franchise which has recently felt like it&#x27;s been caught up in a custody battle between Xbox and PlayStation.

Spiral Abyss is the only true endgame content for players at high Adventure Ranks. In a recent Gamespot interview, a miHoYo spokesperson was asked if there were plans to release more permanent endgame content in the &quot;same vein&quot;.


&quot;The Spiral Abyss is one of the most effective ways [for] players [to] test out their party composition and combat strength,&quot; miHoYo replied. &quot;If we design another type of permanent endgame that is similar to the Spiral Abyss, it might end up creating excessive anxiety for our players - not everyone is interested in Musk Reef.&quot;

The trailer follows four different Trainers as they explore the Paldean region, showing the variety of adventuring available.


Most significant is the game&#x27;s Let&#x27;s Go feature that allows partner Pokémon to be sent off to battle others alone in the world, or gather items, which should make grinding much smoother.

                              <span>Activision has released its first gameplay trailer of the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which gives us our first glimpse of the first-person shooter&#x27;s campaign.


The trailer largely confirms the rumours and leaks of the past few months which suggested the campaign would involve the global War on Drugs. 


Task Force 141 is deployed in an unnamed South American country, as it seeks out a terrorist that appears to be allied with drug traffickers. Essentially, the story entangles the War on Terror with the War on Drugs.

EA&#x27;s latest trailer for the game was published today on PlayStation&#x27;s official YouTube channel for Latin America, which has 664,000 subscribers, and wrongly labels the revived survival horror as coming to both PS4 and PS5. 


The listing sparked fan speculation and media reports that the game was also quietly being developed for PS4 and Xbox One.

The Stadia controller currently works on other devices via a USB cable, but it also has wireless functionality in the form of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that&#x27;s firmware locked. 


While owners wait for a response from Google, some have taken matters into their own hands with some quirky workarounds.

What is the Lost Between Worlds expansion? That&#x27;s a good question - since Ubisoft is yet to announce it. We&#x27;ve asked the publisher for more information today.


Still, details for the Far Cry 6 Game of the Year Edition are now live via listings on the Xbox and PlayStation stores. These note that Lost Between Worlds is &quot;coming soon&quot; - so your £100 purchase will simply grant access whenever it does become available.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has acquired a majority stake in Limbic Entertainment, the developer behind its forthcoming sim game Park Beyond.


The deal marks an increased investment in the German developer, representing the publisher&#x27;s move to create a significant proportion of its business outside of Japan. 


Park Beyond will be Limbic&#x27;s highest profile release so far: a theme park game where players can create bizarre attractions using the &quot;impossification&quot; gimmick. Bandai Namco aims for Limbic&#x27;s sim games to become the new standard.

                              <span>After a rocky launch, Blizzard has updated fans on its progress tackling some of the various issues which have plagued Overwatch 2 over the past 24 hours. 


Many fans have been left unable to play for long periods, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.


These issues have been exacerbated by a series of DDOS attacks aimed at the game&#x27;s servers. And today, following a bruising 24 hours, Blizzard has apologised.

                              <span>Blizzard has pulled back from its requirement that players add their mobile phone number to their Battle.net account in order to play Overwatch 2. 


It was previously mandatory for players to enroll in the &quot;SMS Protect&quot; system to access the game. Players who declined would be unable to login to the game&#x27;s servers. 


Blizzard argued that SMS Protect was necessary as the game transitioned to a live service free-to-play model, in order to combat &quot;disruptive behaviour&quot; and stop banned users simply creating a new account.

                              <span>With less than 24 hours to go until the long-awaited reveal of EA and developer Criterion&#x27;s latest Need for Speed game, a full name, plus a release date, and screens have leaked online.


All this comes via a listing, still live at the time of writing, on Japanese retailer Neowing&#x27;s website - which, assuming its veracity (highly likely given the nature of the assets and details included), corroborates virtually all previous rumours circulating around the game in recent months.


First is the name, Need for Speed: Unbound, which tallies with a report from Insider Gaming at the end of September, as does Neowing&#x27;s listed release date of 2nd December this year.

Inquisitor - Martyr is a Diablo-esque take on the Warhammer 40,000 universe, casting players as Inquisitors who must battle their way, either solo or with friends, through a &quot;haunted fortress-monastery which hides a terrible secret from the past&quot;.


It features cover-based combat, four classes (Psyker, Crusader, Assassin, and Tech-Adept, with the new Sororitas class due at a later date), a procedurally generated mission system, skill trees, a wide range of weapons and vehicles, two-player local co-op on consoles - as well as four-player online multiplayer - and more.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the superb rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, has expanded once more, this time introducing a free Boss Rush mode - and an assortment of related rewards for those with sufficient skills - for players on PC.


Boss Rush mode is accessed through a basement door in the Prisoner&#x27;s Quarters and features four different stages to battle through. All four stages feature back-to-back bosses to defeat, one containing three bosses, another featuring five bosses, plus two more containing three and five enhanced bosses respectively. These enhanced bosses feature &quot;more ways to kick your ass&quot;, including new limbs, healing powers, and even some friends to help them.


Each of the four challenges feature bosses randomly selected from three tiers (although players must have encountered them in Normal mode before they appear), with three-boss challenges starting with a boss from Tier 1, then moving on to Tier 2, then Tier 3. Five-boss challenges feature two Tier 1 bosses, two Tier 2 bosses, then a final boss from Tier 3.

                              <span>Nintendo has quietly tightened up its policies regarding the release of adult games on Switch, a publisher has said.


In a recent Twitter thread (thanks, Nintendo Everything), adult game publisher Gamuzumi told fans it had heard back from Nintendo after facing an unexpected delay in the launch of its most recent title, Hot Tentacles Shooter.


According to Gamuzumi, which describes itself as a &quot;boutique publisher focused on releasing mature or &#x27;ecchi&#x27; [softcore hentai] titles&quot;, Nintendo has now ruled that games featuring topless anime women are no longer allowed.

Wild Hearts, a collaboration between EA Originals and Koei Tecmo&#x27;s Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series), transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan where up to three players can battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.


Omega Force - which has previous experience in the monster hunting genre, courtesy of its two Toukiden games - has now expanded on Wild Hearts&#x27; initial reveal with seven minutes of new, largely uninterrupted gameplay footage.

                              <span>The CD Projekt Red team helming development on the next Cyberpunk game will relocate to Boston in the US to start a new internal studio.


Yesterday, the Polish developer released a detailed timeline documenting all its upcoming games for the foreseeable future. This included the next game in the Cyberpunk series, which is codenamed &quot;Orion&quot;, along with updates on its Witcher series and a new IP known for now as &quot;Hadar&quot;.


Following this announcement, CD Projekt Red&#x27;s global PR director Radek Grabowski shared that the company would  establish a new studio, known as CD Projekt Red North America, to lead its next Cyberpunk-based project.

Sign-ups are now live via the PlayStation App and PlayStation.com, Sony has said, though new members will accepted on a &quot;rolling basis&quot; and some should expect to be &quot;randomly put on the waitlist&quot;. 


If you are put on the waitlist, you will be able to gain access &quot;in about two months&quot; from your registration date.

The role has instead gone to Jennifer Hale, who has voiced characters such as Commander Shephard in Mass Effect and Naomi Hunter in the Metal Gear Solid series, to name but a few.


In an interview with Game Informer, which features Bayonetta 3 as its cover this issue, director Yusuke Miyata explained that &quot;overlapping circumstances&quot; meant that Taylor was unable to reprise her role as Bayonetta. As such, Hale stepped in to take the place of the series&#x27; title role, with Miyata stating he felt she was a &quot;good match for the character&quot; (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

At least this collaboration makes some sense - both Rocket League maker Psyonix and Fortnite are products of Epic Games, which has already worked in the past to bring its two audiences together.


Now, you can drive Rocket League&#x27;s most famous vehicle - the Octane - within Fortnite. As you&#x27;d expect, it behaves just as it would on a Rocket League pitch - able to boost to high speeds and rapidly climb up walls.

On Steam, its £50 price sits in line with other upcoming AAA launches, such as Gotham Knights, Sonic Frontiers, The Callisto Protocol, Hogwarts Legacy and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns.

On console, the price point for these games varies a little more. Sonic Frontiers is £50, Callisto Protocol is £55 and Hogwarts Legacy is £60, while Gotham Knights and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns are £65.

With this app in play, users will now be able to see all of the channel&#x27;s offerings in Ultra HD thanks to its 4K HDR playback support (the PlayStation 4 version of the app was limited to 1080p).


&quot;A key part of our global expansion strategy is to meet consumers wherever they are, which is why we&#x27;re excited to enhance both Disney Plus and Star Plus for PlayStation 5 users,&quot; said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of product and design for Disney streaming (thanks, The Verge). &quot;The ability to support 4K HDR video streaming on the platform will also improve the viewing experience for fans.&quot;

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has laid out a timeline for its second phase of investigations into Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, following concerns this deal could be deemed anti-competitive.


New documentation from the CMA states that its statutory deadline to publish the final report will be 1st March, 2023. As such, the final deadline for all parties&#x27; responses regarding this investigation will be in February.


Between that time and now, the CMA will be conducting meetings with the main and third parties involved with this acquisition, issuing questionnaires and verifying the information provided.

                              <span>The European Union has voted to adopt a single charger design for use across all portable games consoles, smartphones, tablets and laptops sold in the region. 


Technology manufacturers will now be required to use USB-C charging ports in all smartphones and tablets sold in the region from 2024, and in laptops from 2026. Mice, keyboards, headphones are also included.


As previously reported, the UK decided to opt out out of being included in this initiative when it was first proposed, despite its aims to cut electronic waste and generally make things a bit easier for those with a drawer full of random Lightning cables,  micro-USB and mini-USB wires. Thanks Brexit!

I tend to fall on the apathy end of the spectrum; I don’t think I’ve ever mentioned it before. But the memes can be funny.
Here’s a decent rundown of some of the chatter.</span>

We expect the brand new Third Party Security Audit of Kubernetes will be
published later this month (Oct 2022).
In preparation for that, let&#x27;s look at the state of findings that were made
public as part of the last third party security audit of
2019
that was based on Kubernetes v1.13.4.
Motivation
Craig Ingram has graciously attempted over the years to keep track of the
status of the findings reported in the last audit in this issue:
kubernetes/kubernetes#81146.
This blog post will attempt to dive deeper into this, address any gaps
in tracking and become a point in time summary of the state of the
findings reported from 2019.

Players have reported unexpected server errors and difficulties joining Overwatch 2 games throughout the evening following today&#x27;s free-to-play launch, with some claiming to be experiencing queues of as many as 40,000 other players.


An earlier tweet by Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra acknowledged today&#x27;s server woes but gave no indication they might be the result of anything other that launch day teething troubles, only thanking players for their patience and pledging to &quot;get [them] into the fun&quot;.

                              <span>Tequila Works, the developer behind the likes of the sublime Rime and intriguing VR murder-mystery The Invisible Hours, has confirmed its formerly Stadia-exclusive action-adventure Gylt will be going multiplatform next year.


Gylt, an enjoyably surreal horror yarn that follows the adventures of a young girl in search of her missing cousin, launched exclusively on Stadia back in 2019. And while Tequila Works did at one point suggest a multiplatform release might eventually be on the cards, it&#x27;s remained resolutely Stadia-bound in the years since.


However, following last week&#x27;s announcement that Google will be shutting down Stadia on 18th January next year - a move that prompted questions as to what might happen to the cloud gaming service&#x27;s handful of remaining exclusives - Tequila Works has confirmed Gylt will finally be getting a multiplatform release some time in 2023.

                              <span>CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński has announced he&#x27;ll be stepping down from his joint-CEO role - a position he&#x27;s held at the company for nearly 30 years - before the end of 2022.


&quot;I am beginning a brand-new personal chapter at CD Projekt,&quot; Iwiński wrote in a statement shared following the company&#x27;s latest investor meeting, &quot;as I will submit my candidacy for the role of Chairman of the Supervisory Board, leaving behind my joint-CEO role. By the end of 2022, I&#x27;ll hand over my duties to my colleagues from the board.&quot;


&quot;For me this is a huge moment,&quot; Iwiński continued. &quot;I&#x27;ve been at CD Projekt for almost 30 years and I have seen it go from a handful of passion-driven rebels to an internationally recognised developer of story-driven role-playing games loved by millions globally. Back when Michał Kiciński and I founded the company, I don&#x27;t think either of us would have been able to imagine this incredible journey, not even in our wildest dreams.&quot;

                              <span>PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst has revealed Sony&#x27;s first-party PlayStation releases will likely take &quot;at least a year&quot; to launch on PC, although live-service games might come sooner.


Sony initially confirmed it was exploring bringing its first-party PlayStation exclusives to PC in March 2020, announcing that Horizon Zero Dawn would lead the charge - although it said &quot;releasing one first-party AAA title to PC doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that every game now will come to PC&quot; and that it didn&#x27;t have plans to follow Xbox&#x27;s lead with day-and-date PC releases.


Since then, following the successful launch of Horizon Zero Dawn on PC, the number of titles joining the platform has continued to grow. Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered have already made the jump, with Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Uncharted: The Legacy Collection, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure confirmed to be on the way.

In anticipation of this release, we now finally have our first look at some gameplay, including seeing weapons such as the series&#x27; plasma cutter in action. Oh, yes, and there are also lots of gloriously detailed mutated human corpses littering the scene. Godspeed to you Isaac Clark!

                              <span>Sega has announced a three-month delay to Company of Heroes 3, which will now arrive on 23rd February 2023. 


Announcing the hold-up this afternoon, Sega said Relic Entertainment&#x27;s real-time strategy threequel was currently &quot;not quite up to our players&#x27; or our own high standards&quot;, with &quot;bugs to squash, pixels to polish, gameplay to adjust and feedback to address&quot;. 


On that last point, Sega says developer Relic is continuing to react to community feedback on improvements to the game&#x27;s dynamic campaign map, a stronger visual focus on &quot;grit and details&quot; during battles, an overhauled light system, plus tweaks to the HUD and UI.

                              <span>Psychological horror game The Medium is the latest in a long line of video games to be getting a TV adaptation. 


Bloober Team shared the news in a blog post earlier today, where the company announced it had signed a cooperation agreement with Polish visual arts complany Platige Image to bring its game to a new medium (see what I did there).


This upcoming adaptation will be helmed by Tomasz Bagiński, whose resume includes Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher. Meanwhile, Bloober Team&#x27;s Piotr Babieno will work alongside Bagiński bringing this adaptation to life.

At the end of August, both Sony and Chinese publisher Tencent increased their shareholding in the Elden Ring and Soulsbourne studio. Sony now owns just over 14 percent.

Per The Washington Post, Activision Blizzard and the QA testers from Raven Software will now continue on with their negotiations to agree a collective bargaining agreement.
However, if the two parties can not settle upon an agreement, the NLRB can issue a complaint against Activision Blizzard. Another option would be for the NLRB to prosecute the case before a federal judge should the company refuse to settle, although this is deemed unlikely.

Officially, that is. 


Unofficially, we&#x27;ve glimpsed a leaked clip of early gameplay that doesn&#x27;t tell us a great deal, and there have been industry whispers to expect the game in December.

Last week, Colour shared a screenshot of his playtime in Red Dead Redemption 2 on Stadia on Twitter. In a follow-up tweet he tagged Rockstar, asking for a character transfer.

The pound, mercifully, is not yet affected - but many other countries will be. These include Poland, Sweden, Chile, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea and Vietnam, plus Pokémon&#x27;s homeland of Japan - a core market for Pokémon Go.


And while the change is driven by Apple&#x27;s action, Niantic has said it will raise its prices in-game whether you use an iPhone or not.

A jury has decided the companies must pay $3750 to Catherine Alexander, who designed tattoos for pro wrestler Randy Orton, after their likenesses appeared on Orton&#x27;s character in WWE 2K16, 17 and 18.


Alexander had pushed for a higher amount, including a share of profits from the games, Reuters reported. Still, the decision appears to mark a landmark judgement that may affect future usage rights in other games in future.

                              <span>An ex-NSA employee has been charged with trying to sell classified data to the Russians (but instead actually talking to an undercover FBI agent).
It’s a weird story, and the FBI affidavit raises more questions than it answers. The employee only worked for the NSA for three weeks—which is weird in itself. I can’t figure out how he linked up with the undercover FBI agent. It’s not clear how much of this was the employee’s idea, and whether he was goaded by the FBI agent. Still, hooray for not leaking NSA secrets to the Russians. (And, almost ten years after Snowden, do we still have this much trouble vetting people before giving them security clearances?)...</span>

Whether on-premises or in the cloud, clusters face real constraints for resource usage, quota, and cost management reasons. Regardless of the autoscalling capabilities, clusters have finite capacity. As a result, users want an easy way to fairly and
efficiently share resources.
In this article, we introduce Kueue,
an open source job queueing controller designed to manage batch jobs as a single unit.
Kueue leaves pod-level orchestration to existing stable components of Kubernetes.
Kueue natively supports the Kubernetes Job
API and offers hooks for integrating other custom-built APIs for batch jobs.
Why Kueue?
Job queueing is a key feature to run batch workloads at scale in both on-premises and cloud environments. The main goal…</span>

                              <span>Six years after its launch, the original Overwatch is no more, with Blizzard having now forever pulled the plug on the game in preparation for Overwatch 2&#x27;s free-to-play arrival tomorrow.


Fans gathered earlier today to witness the final moments of Overwatch, recording the momentous occasion for posterity. Despite its place in the gaming pantheon, though, it met an unceremonious end, blinking out of existing with a simple &quot;disconnected&quot; message.


A few official lobby chat server messages did at least attempt to imbue the occasion with some import, telling players, &quot;Even the best journeys end, but a new one is right around the corner. Thank you, heroes! See you October 4th!&quot;. A final message ahead of Overwatch 1&#x27;s oblivion simply read, &quot;See you on the other side&quot;.

Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games&#x27; much-loved 2008 original, once again putting players in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke as they journey through the Necromorph-infested mining ship USG Ishimura. This time, though, EA Motive is attempting to bolster the fear factor on modern systems with enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks including improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Since confirming a Dead Space remake was in the works last year, EA Motive has been unusually open about its development process, detailing the project&#x27;s progress in a series of livestreams focusing on gameplay changes, audio, and art.

This project was dubbed Heroes of Hyrule, and would not have had Link as the main character. Rather, the Hylian hero would have turned up as an NPC. 


Per YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming, which got its hands on Retro Studios&#x27; original pitch, Heroes of Hyrule would have told the story of a magical book.

When Black launched in 2006 for PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, it promised to be Criterion&#x27;s revolutionary take on the FPS genre - just as Burnout had won legions of fans for the studio&#x27;s version of racing. 


The game recieved largely positive reviews, though early plans for a sequel never materialised. Some who worked on the game, including its namesake Stuart Black, later left to make Bodycount - a spiritual successor developed by Codemasters.

                              <span>Sony is reportedly planning to make 2m units of its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset by March.

That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which has reported that mass production of the headset began last month.

These high production figures show Sony has an &quot;ambitious&quot; roadmap ahead of the VR2&#x27;s release, it was said.

                              <span>High-profile mod maker Lance McDonald has released footage of what looks to be a working PlayStation 5 exploit that leaves the console &quot;jailbroken&quot;. 


McDonald&#x27;s video appears to show custom code being read by a PS5 through an exploit in its online User Guide. Once run, the console is able to access debug settings and then install the infamous PT demo - which is, of course, no longer available under normal circumstances.


So, how bad is this for Sony? Well, for now, the use of this exploit is limited. Reportedly this method is still &quot;fairly unstable&quot; and offers &quot;read/write access, but no execute&quot; - so you could download the PT demo, for example, but not yet play it.

                              <span>Last week, Google announced it will shut down its cloud gaming service Stadia in January. While Google confirmed it will refund all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store, as well as all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store, users have been left concerned about their in-game data. 


Thankfully, developers are trying to ensure these players are not going to see their efforts wasted when Stadia ultimately closes its doors.


Sharing an update on Twitter, Hitman developer IO Interactive announced it was currently &quot;looking into ways&quot; for its Google Stadia fans to &quot;continue [their] Hitman experience on other platforms&quot;.

But Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has now beaten that, as noted on Twitter by GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s Brendan Sinclair.

Originally revealed by MP1st, this remaster will allegedly bring Zero Dawn closer in terms of visuals to its successor, Forbidden West. 


While, at the time of writing, it is unclear whether this is a &quot;from the ground up&quot; remake of the 2017 title, it is claimed that this version of Zero Dawn will see new character models, improvements to the game&#x27;s lighting system and animations, and &quot;overhauled textures&quot;.

                              <span>This is interesting research:
In this paper, we develop a new mechanism for detecting audio deepfakes using techniques from the field of articulatory phonetics. Specifically, we apply fluid dynamics to estimate the arrangement of the human vocal tract during speech generation and show that deepfakes often model impossible or highly-unlikely anatomical arrangements. When parameterized to achieve 99.9% precision, our detection mechanism achieves a recall of 99.5%, correctly identifying all but one deepfake sample in our dataset.

Kubernetes v1.25 introduces the support for user namespaces.
This is a major improvement for running secure workloads in
Kubernetes. Each pod will have access only to a limited subset of the
available UIDs and GIDs on the system, thus adding a new security
layer to protect from other pods running on the same system.
How does it work?
A process running on Linux can use up to 4294967296 different UIDs and
GIDs.
User namespaces is a Linux feature that allows mapping a set of users
in the container to different users in the host, thus restricting what
IDs a process can effectively use.
Furthermore, the capabilities granted in a new user namespace do not
apply in the host initial namespaces.
Why is it important?

After failing their San Andreas driving test, redditor MotorDesigner reached out to the GTA subreddit for advice on the best way to get around the city without a car - legally, in other words, even though the concept is comically novel in any GTA game, of course.

Admittedly, the in-game driving test doesn&#x27;t look too troublesome - questions include when it&#x27;s permissible to run a red light, what the correct driving position is, and how best to drive when &quot;getting serviced orally by a girl while driving&quot; - MotorDesigner failed to meet the San Andreas Department of Motor Vehicles&#x27; low, low standards, and therefore cannot drive legally in the city.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard&#x27;s chief compliance officer, Frances Townsend, is stepping down.

Bloomberg reports that Townsend - who also serves as executive vice president of corporate affairs - will step down ahead of Microsoft&#x27;s billion pound deal to acquire Activision (if it goes through, of course).

Townsend will, however, remain with the company as an advisor to the board and CEO Bobby Kotick, although his future at the company is also in doubt if and when the acquisition goes through.

                              <span>Chinese megacorp Tencent is reportedly &quot;resetting its mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) strategy&quot; by focussing on &quot;buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies&quot;.

According to Reuters, Tencent traditionally acquired minority stakes and was content with being a &quot;passive financial investor&quot;, but it is now &quot;aggressively seeking to own majority or even controlling stakes in overseas targets&quot;, chiefly in the &quot;core gaming sector&quot;. Metaverse assets are also reportedly of interest to Tencent. 

Citing &quot;four people with direct knowledge of the matter&quot;, Reuters adds that the shift in Tencent&#x27;s M&amp;A strategy &quot;comes as the world&#x27;s number one gaming firm by revenue is counting on global markets for its future growth, which requires a strong portfolio of chart-topping games&quot; and follows regulatory issues in its home country.

&quot;While Stadia will shut down on January 18, 2023, we&#x27;re happy to share that we&#x27;re working to bring the games you own on Stadia to PC through Ubisoft Connect,&quot; Ubisoft tweeted.

In a series of messages shared on Twitter, Dandy @ 6.2 –  who clarifies that they are &quot;not a victim in this&quot; but is &quot;speaking out for a friend who IS a victim who otherwise felt like she had no voice&quot; – posts a number of incriminating messages that intimate that despite reporting him, the alleged &quot;sex pest&quot; known as Charcoal Salamander had yet to be stripped of his &quot;admin&quot; role on the server. 

&quot;So who else knew that the Phasmophobia devs are housing a sex pest in their official discord by keeping him admin and refusing to take any claims against him seriously because I sure do now,&quot; tweeted Dandy @ 6.2.

In a succinct yet puzzling Medium post, Martin Luiga – a founding member of ZA/UM and seeming &quot;secretary of the ZA/UM cultural association&quot; – revealed that designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov haven&#x27;t worked at the company &quot;since the end of last year&quot;, &quot;which would seem like bad news for the loving fans that are waiting for the Disco sequel&quot;, Luiga said.

We&#x27;ve already told you about Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s second life. Cyberpunk 2077 initially shifted 13m copies when it arrived for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in December 2020, but interest in the game dropped when word of its technical issues spread.

We’re now learning that the CIA is still “using an irresponsibly secured system for asset communication.”
Citizen Lab did the research:
Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used these sites for covert communication...</span>

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing the failure of Stadia, and why Google&#x27;s cloud gaming gamble struggled from the start.


The announcement of Stadia&#x27;s demise came as a shock to some - including many developers with titles only weeks from launch - yet still feels like it was on the cards for some time. After a rocky launch and the closure of Google&#x27;s internal game development studios, what future did Stadia have left? Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson weighed in earlier today with his thoughts.

                              <span>A lifelong Nintendo fan has decided to make a realistic Super Mario Bros remake, and posted a movie-style trailer on YouTube to document their most recent update.

The YouTuber, who has uploaded their videos to the channel Re-Imagined Games, started work on the remake over two months ago.

According to a new report from 9to5google, the project received initial approval but as it was intended to be a strictly single-player experience (instead of the asynchronous multiplayer in Death Stranding), the Kojima collaboration was cancelled as Google believed there was no longer a market for solo games.



Despite reaching the early stages of development, the project was reportedly cancelled by Stadia&#x27;s general manager Phil Harrison in mid 2020 following the first mockups.

These tidbits are not meant to tease any particular storyline from Dreadwolf, but are included in a blog post detailing how BioWare&#x27;s writing team works together to build Dragon Age&#x27;s expansive world. 


The first codex entry presented here comes from a character&#x27;s diary - someone who, if we had to guess, is likely one of your new companions.

Elevated Chat, as it&#x27;s known, is currently a limited time experiment for four weeks only available for select streamers.


It allows viewers to pay to &quot;elevate&quot; their message in chat, either pinned to the top of chat or at the bottom of the video player. Varying payment amounts allows for various amounts of time for elevation.

                              <span>A little over six months after its big reveal, World of Warcraft&#x27;s Dragonflight expansion has been given a release date, with its launch now officially scheduled for 28th November this year.


As detailed back in April, Dragonflight&#x27;s first major addition is a new location known as the Dragon Isles, the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind. This, in turn, brings four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, the expansive Ohn&#x27;ahran Plains, the frozen Azure Span, and the majestic Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also introduces a new playable race-class hybrid (a first for WoW) known as the Dracthyr Evokers, which can switch between human and draconic forms. Depending on a player&#x27;s chosen class specialisations, its focus is either damage dealing or healing.

                              <span>Google is shutting down Stadia, with the beleaguered cloud gaming service set to remain live for players until 18th January 2023.


Stadia&#x27;s misfortunes are, of course, well-documented; despite initial praise for the service&#x27;s streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia&#x27;s failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.


And while Google continued to insist Stadia was &quot;alive and well&quot; as 2021 progressed, reports claimed it had &quot;deprioritised&quot; the consumer-facing side of its game streaming platform, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services&#x27; underlying technology to third-parties.

The highlight of this new investment package is 50bn riyals (£12bn) earmarked for the acquisition of &quot;a leading game publisher to become a strategic development partner,&quot; according to the state&#x27;s press agency.  


Another 70 billion riyals (£16bn) is pegged for minority stakes in other companies, while the rest will be spent targeting industry disruptors and mature industry partners to enhance Savvy&#x27;s portfolio.

Those of you with a discerning ear may find the voice very familiar. As a lot of people have pointed out, it sounds a lot like Mark Hamill.

The datamine comes from Twitter user LaisulMV, previously known as AisulMV.

&quot;From the moment you start the game to the moment you end the game, there are no camera cuts or load screens—unless you die,&quot; says senior producer Philippe Ducharme.

The anime adaptation of the cult classic Sega game was first announced back in September 2020, before being broadcasted and available to stream on Adult Swim and Crunchyroll respectively.  


A second season was reportedly in the works before the cancellation, which is likely a part of the wider purge by Warner Discovery of its properties following the merger of the two media conglomerates in April this year.

One hundred twenty-seven apps varied in what the apps were allowed to access on users’ mobile phones, 49 of which had additional permissions deemed “dangerous” by Google. Apps in Bahrain, Tunisia and Canada requested the most additional dangerous permissions.
Three VPN apps enable clear text communication in some countries, which allows unauthorized access to users’ communications.

Immutable fields can be found in a few places in the built-in Kubernetes types.
For example, you can&#x27;t change the .metadata.name of an object. Specific objects
have fields where changes to existing objects are constrained; for example, the
.spec.selector of a Deployment.
Aside from simple immutability, there are other common design patterns such as
lists which are append-only, or a map with mutable values and immutable keys.
Until recently the best way to restrict field mutability for CustomResourceDefinitions
has been to create a validating
admission webhook:
this means a lot of complexity for the common case of making a field immutable.

validation constraints on their fields…</span>

In a Twitter thread, developer Gameloft said it expected the update to launch &quot;in around three weeks&quot;, and fix several priority bugs such as issues with lost progress, missing founder&#x27;s pack rewards, and general console crashes.


October&#x27;s update will also add new features, such as an improved photo mode and new poses for your character avatar.

Warzone, which launched as a standalone free-to-play battle royale in March 2020 following the successful launch of 2019&#x27;s Modern Warfare soft reboot, was an overnight phenomenon fuelled by lockdowns that made billions of dollars for Activision.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority has found several mobile phone game adverts likely to cause &quot;serious or widespread offence&quot; due to harmful gender stereotypes. 


An advert for one game, Refantasia: Charm and Conquer, is described as having featured an &quot;anime-style image of a young woman in a cage&quot; in shackles and with torn clothing, which was singled out for particular criticism. 


Captions referenced &quot;my master&quot; and were accompanied by text which described the person as a &quot;little girl&quot;. The ASA judged the character as being someone under 18 represented in a sexual manner.

That story will now explain how players got to be so Honey I Shrunk The Kids small, Obsidian says, and potentially also allow you to &quot;go big and go home&quot; once all is said and done. 


Before that, though, there&#x27;s plenty of new things to experience in version 1.0. A new area of the garden, the Eastern Upper Yard, has been opened up to players. It features a new tunnel system, more towering manmade items and fresh &quot;angry bugs&quot;.

But it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s called the metaverse. I don&#x27;t care what people want to call it.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret we&#x27;re big fans of PowerWash Simulator here at Eurogamer which, for me, makes this hour-long development deep dive video something of a must-watch. 


I&#x27;ve often wondered while playing whether certain objects auto-complete faster than others. If you&#x27;re yet to try PowerWash yourself, it&#x27;s worth knowing the game will, after you clean a certain amount of surface area, auto-complete the rest of the object in question. (This also provides a nice &#x27;ding&#x27; sound.)


This subject is one of many covered in the developer video, which is ostensibly about how levels in the game are created but also delves into thoughts on dirt design, parkour, and the game&#x27;s lack of fall damage.

Following the release of the Night Ops Camo, Arctic Camo, and Daystrike Camo controllers, this Mineral Camo Xbox controller comes in a &quot;bold mineral blue, bright purple, aqua, and dark purple camouflage pattern&quot;. Microsoft says this controller is inspired by &quot;geode crystals&quot;, and that it &quot;finds the perfect balance between striking and subdued.&quot;

                              <span>The 17-year-old suspect believed to behind the recent hack of Grand Theft Auto maker Rockstar Games has pled not guilty to the charge of computer misuse. 


However, the teen did plead guilty to breaching bail conditions, Eurogamer understands. 


In a statement to Eurogamer this afternoon, the City of London Police&#x27;s Cyber Crime Unit acknowledged the individual had appeared in court over the weekend - and was now being held at a youth detention centre.

                              <span>Yves Guillemot, boss and co-founder of Ubisoft, has raised eyebrows for his comments on the need for &quot;a little friction&quot; in game development. 


Discussing his company&#x27;s troubles with harassment and workplace toxicity, as highlighted by a number of employees since the summer of 2020, Guillemot told La Presse that Ubisoft had been &quot;progressing at a good pace&quot; in dealing with its issues - but that &quot;creating a video game is not easy&quot; and sometimes created &quot;a lot of tension&quot;. 


&quot;Techniques must be put in place to ensure that everyone succeeds in finding their place,&quot; Guillemot continued, now discussing the games industry in general. &quot;To create, you need a little friction, because everyone has to succeed in getting their idea across. It&#x27;s a job that brings a lot of rewards when you succeed, but it&#x27;s difficult.&quot;

Both Nioh games were originally released on PS4 and PC, but never on Microsoft&#x27;s console.


Speaking to VGC, Nioh director Fumihiko Yasuda downplayed any possibility of the game coming to Xbox.

                              <span>Yesterday, as part of The Last of Us day, we were treated to the first full trailer for the franchise&#x27;s upcoming HBO adaptation, starring Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This trailer didn&#x27;t have any real dialogue between the characters (there were plenty of tense looks and some furtive Shh-ing), but it still offered an evocative picture of the world that HBO has created for its TV audience. You can see this trailer for yourself below. 


Right off the bat, it is clear HBO has taken this adaptation seriously, with several scenes looking like they have been pulled straight from Naughty Dog&#x27;s video game series. There is a lot to unpack in the minute and half or so of footage, so let&#x27;s dive on in.

Reddit user jamcar70 shared their impressive milestone on the game&#x27;s subreddit, to a stunned response.

The feat took jamcar70 two years, 34 days and four hours of playtime to achieve, as shown on their screenshot to prove their in-game savings.

The Altar of Hope update adds a new type of reward - Candles of Hope - which you can earn and then spend on various attributes which should make future missions safer for your party.


As you&#x27;d expect, the bigger the danger, the bigger reward in terms of Candles bagged at the end. Missions will offer more Candles the further you manage to progress, but suffer a wipe and you&#x27;ll see your Candle hoard penalised.

Speaking to IGN, Kato admitted he likes the style but the 2D pixel art of the original has been retained instead.


&quot;No, we didn&#x27;t think about making it HD-2D,&quot; he said. &quot;We kind of played with the idea of making it 3D, but what we were really thinking about was, &#x27;What are the major parts about this game that are really appealing to everybody?&#x27; And in the 2D original, it was really well done pixel art, so we realised that we couldn&#x27;t have a Tactics Ogre game without this really high-quality, awesome looking 2D pixel art. So to bring that sort of resolution and that sort of fidelity to new hardware and new technology was a lot of effort. But yeah, I think we did it.&quot;

ReImagine, as the unofficial fan server was known, has since been shut down.


Atlus&#x27;s MMO was first released in Japan in 2007 and had players exploring a post-apocalyptic Tokyo. North American (2008) and European (2009) releases followed, but the game was officially shut down in 2016.

The information can also be viewed in Splatnet 3, a complementary online service to Splatoon 3 which was made available through the Switch Online app at the game&#x27;s launch.

Along with this news, we also have a breakdown of his moveset. 


This will include fart bombs (of course) and a move called &quot;Meeseeks and Destroys&quot; which summons a meeseek that will then attack by running forward and deploying an uppercut or by wielding a golfclub. Lastly, Rick will be able to aim and place two portals thanks to his &quot;Basrick Portal Theory&quot; move.

A financial update from People Can Fly states that Take-Two is ditching the project after two years of work - but that development will still continue. 


Codenamed Project Dagger, the game is said to be a new action adventure IP, which People Can Fly now retains the rights to. It sounds like Take-Two had the option to purchase these rights - which it has not exercised.

                              <span>Today is The Last of Us day, an annual occasion formerly known as Outbreak Day that marks the in-universe date in which the Cordyceps infection spread throughout humanity. 


This year, to celebrate the occasion, Naughty Dog and HBO have released a new trailer for their upcoming TV adaptation, which stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This new trailer gives us all a closer look at Ellie and Joel in action as they make their way across America. Along with seeing more of the two protagonists, we now also have a better, but still brief look at the series&#x27; infected Clickers - complete with their unmistakable and haunting noises. Other characters such as Ellie&#x27;s friend Riley also make a showing. You can see the trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>Battlefield 2042 Season 2 continues today with the arrival of update 2.1, which most notably reworks the (appropriately named) map Renewal. 


DICE has taken the decision &quot;to competely remove certain sections of the map&quot; which it has decided broke the game&#x27;s &quot;flow&quot; or were simply &quot;too far away&quot;. 


Getting around the game will be quicker too - as Battlefield adds the Polaris RZR buggy as an in-world vehicle. To my eyes, it looks like a cross between a tank and a golf cart. Why not?

                              <span>Netflix is forming its own in-house game studio, as it seeks to rely less on third-party developers.


The new studio will be based in Helsinki and led by Marko Lastikka as director, formerly of Zynga and EA.


The studio will create &quot;world class&quot; original games without ads or in-app purchases, reports Engadget.

                              <span>A modder has added VR and motion controls to Trombone Champ. 

Their latest mod is Trombone Champ, the surprise Steam hit of last week.

Raicuparta shared a video of himself attempting Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony in VR. The display inside the headset shows a first-person view of the titular Trombone Champ and the gameplay screen is projected in front of you. The game is played with motion controls, meaning you have to extend and retract your arm instead of moving a mouse back and forth for the correct notes.

The LA-based show will open its doors for the first time since 2019 at its usual home of the Los Angeles Convention Centre, following mixed success as an online event in the interim. 


Next year will see the LACC&#x27;s two main halls divided into separate spaces for industry attendees and those attending as fans - similar to how the various halls are separated at Gamescom.

Twitter user MetroidMike64 spent seven years working on his Super World, which he has unofficially named Super Mario Bros. 5, and uploaded the finished product online yesterday.
MetroidMike64 began creating levels in 2015 using Super Mario Maker on the Wii U, and had always intended for them to be part of a larger game.

                              <span>The ever-expanding world of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will receive one of its final major updates tomorrow, as it adds a final set of puzzle tombs via patch 1.6.1. 


This activity was originally added to the game earlier this year, and adds a new storyline expanding upon the series&#x27; mysterious precursor Isu race, doled out by exploring a string of fun puzzle dungeons. 


It also allows for Eivor to come face-to-face with a series of British figures from history before her time - such as the ancient queen of the Iceni, Boudicca. Fans have some interesting theories on who may pop up in this concluding set of dungeons (including someone perhaps more from Assassin&#x27;s Creed lore than actual history itself).

Sable: Design Works will be the first instalment from publisher Lost in Cult&#x27;s new series of indie-focussed art books. This particular release, which is due to launch in the second quarter of 2023, will feature interviews from those at developer Shedworks, as well as a &quot;region-by-region insight&quot; into the world of Midden and its art.


The book itself will be split into two different sections, one that &quot;charts the development of Sable from its early concept and prototype, through its production, to launch&quot; and one that focuses exclusively on the artwork and visuals.

The developer - which has assisted with work on the Halo series from as far back as Halo 2 - was reported to be working on a new battle royale mode back in January. The following month, it issued a statement to confirm it was &quot;deepening&quot; its relationship with franchise holder 343 Industries. 


Now, Certain Affinity exec Paul Sams has said the studio&#x27;s still-technically-unannounced project had been in the works for more than two years, with almost 100 staff working on it.

Marvel exec Bill Rosemann set the record straight as part of a GamesIndustry.biz interview, which comes after a succession of announcements for upcoming Iron Man, Black Panther and Wolverine  games.


&quot;The world is, amazingly, very familiar and accepting of the multiverse,&quot; Rosemann said. &quot;We have all these different realities. Now they&#x27;re all real, and we want to give everyone the freedom to tell their story.

                              <span>The 17-year-old from Oxfordshire believed to have been behind the recent gargantuan leak of Grand Theft Auto 6 was set to appear in court in London over the weekend. 


The unamed teen has been charged with two counts of computer misuse, as well as two counts of breaching bail conditions. 


These latter charges likely refer to the teen&#x27;s previous run-in with police over hacking charges - when they were suspected of breaching both Microsoft and Samsung earlier in the year.

                              <span>We have all been there. Ikea - the shop that takes you through a convoluted one-way system as you see mock-ups of rooms full of all you could ever need for your own home, and then before you know it you have purchased 100 tealights and a packet of meatballs.


But what if you were to throw a load of zombie-like monsters into this experience, and then proceed to turn out the lights, leaving the exit near impossible to find? Well, one developer has decided to answer that question in its upcoming game: The Store is closed.


The Store is Closed is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games&#x27; The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy (thanks, PCGamesN).

As with Team Ninja&#x27;s previous Nioh games, Wo Long is a Soulslike game that thrives on challenge. Many players subsequently feel the games are too difficult and inaccessible.


Speaking to MP1st, producer Masaaki Yamagiwa defended Team Ninja&#x27;s decision to stick with one difficulty.

                              <span>There&#x27;s an Onimusha anime in the works for Netflix, Capcom has announced.


This adaptation of Capcom&#x27;s dormant samurai action series is produced by Sublimation Inc., the same company that handled the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma series that was streamed on Netflix in 2020, and is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer, 13 Assassins).


Details are scarce, but Capcom said the anime has &quot;3DCG&quot; animated characters with hand-drawn backgrounds. Protagonist Miyamoto Musashi is modeled on Toshihiro Mifune, the Japanese actor famous for appearing in multiple Akira Kurosawa films who died 25 years ago.

The Kubernetes in-tree storage plugin to Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration infrastructure has already been beta since v1.17. CSI migration was introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.14.
Since then, SIG Storage and other Kubernetes special interest groups are working to ensure feature stability and compatibility in preparation for CSI Migration feature to go GA.
SIG Storage is excited to announce that the core CSI Migration feature is generally available in Kubernetes v1.25 release!
SIG Storage wrote a blog post in v1.23 for CSI Migration status update which discussed the CSI migration status for each storage driver. It has been a while and this article is intended to give a latest status update on each storage driver for their CSI Migration status in Ku…</span>

The new initiative, entitled Screen Culture 2033, will &quot;advocate for the value of the full breadth of screen culture, including video games and interactive work&quot;.

Describing screen culture as &quot;young, dynamic and expanding&quot;, the BFI says &quot;it presents a wider screen landscape that encompasses film, television, digital media, extended reality (XR) and video games&quot; and says &quot;it has become the dominant means of communication, information and storytelling for Gen Z and beyond&quot;.

Originally, the character model and voice for Judgement character Kyohei Hamura was based upon Japanese musician and actor Pierre Taki. Shortly after his drugs arrest, however, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios scrambled to replace him with the voice and likeness of Japanese actor Miou Tanaka instead.

Modder Timo 654, however, has brought Taki back to life - so to speak - by meticulously restoring the original voice lines and likeness.

Whilst we&#x27;ve yet to hear of a definitive date, creator Yoko Taro was at least able to confirm the release window during Aniplex Online Fest, which took place over the weekend.

Interestingly, Taro also revealed that due to the differences between storytelling via games and traditional mediums - and despite Aniplex&#x27;s hopes of a faithful retelling of the game - the anime&#x27;s story will differ.

According to SteamDB, the beta is currently sporting more concurrent players than Team Fortress 2, Destiny 2, GTA 5, and even Cyberpunk 2077, which has seen a boost in its own player numbers recently, too. 

With an all-time concurrent peak of 168,330 players (at the time of writing, anyway; it&#x27;s been increasing steadily all weekend), that means it&#x27;s already beaten the concurrent records for games like Left 4 Dead 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, The Division, FIFA 22, and Borderlands 2.

Twitterer Shinobi602 - a games industry brand manager - found themselves intrigued enough by the sci-fi horror&#x27;s most recent promotional video that they texted the number that pops up in the latest trailer.

After texting the number, Shinobi received a mysterious video response. The secretive teaser flashes words like &quot;secrets, answers, ARCAS, lies&quot; and ends with a date: 29th September.

Confirmation came via TUDUM and a tweet on the official Netflix account, which simply announced: &quot;Our family returns! The Witcher is back for Season 3 in Summer 2023.&quot;

We also discovered that spin-off The Witcher: Blood Origin will premier &quot;this December&quot;, which is set to star Minnie Driver as the Narrator.

                              <span>They&#x27;ve been up, down, up, down, down, up, and down again, but right now, Dark Souls 3&#x27; PC servers are live once again.

Bandai Namco was originally forced to shutter the PC PvP servers for all Dark Souls games back in January following &quot;reports of an issue with online servers&quot;. Although the publisher described the situation as &quot;temporary&quot;, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3&#x27;s servers finally coming back online at the end of August… and going down again earlier this week.

On 21st September, Bandai Namco said &quot;there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls 3 online play via the Steam platform&quot; and revealed that it was &quot;investigating the source of the problem&quot;, but the servers remained offline for several days.

                              <span>It&#x27;s weekend two of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 beta - and now PC, PlayStation and Xbox players are all getting stuck in, cheaters have entered the battlefield.

And, in response, console players are disabling crossplay in a bid to avoid matching up with those on PC - the platform believed to have the most trouble with hackers.


If it sounds like you&#x27;ve read this story before, it&#x27;s because the same thing happened with the beta for last year&#x27;s Call of Duty Vanguard and 2020&#x27;s Black Ops Cold War.

                              <span>Patch 2.5 is now live in Diablo 2: Resurrected.

The new content includes Terror Zones, the &quot;fresh way to experience the journey to level 99 during seasons&quot; that were launched on the public test realm a little while back as an all-new &quot;experimental&quot; feature.

&quot;Terror looms every hour as the armies of the Burning Hells cause monsters in a specific zone to increase in power and level, encouraging players to level up and collect loot in locations all across Sanctuary,&quot; Blizzard teases.

In a statement shared with staff on Wednesday, Knight said she was off on a &quot;new adventure that provides exciting growth opportunities for [her] both professionally and personally&quot; in the &quot;creator space&quot;.

Knight&#x27;s departure from Twitch means the firm has lost its chief content officer, chief operating officer, and Knight&#x27;s position in the last year alone (thanks, Bloomberg).

In a joint statement, the partnership said that despite 1.3 billion women and girls making up half of the global game&#x27;s community – 60 per cent of whom started gaming before turning 13 – 60 per cent of &quot;girl gamers&quot; polled by Dove &quot;feel misrepresented and recognise a lock of diversity as a key issue in video games&quot;.

35 per cent of young girls also reported that their &quot;self-esteen is negatively impacted after seeing a lack of diversity in characters and avatars&quot;.

Ninja Theory was named by GLHF as a company that utilises the services of Altered AI, a tech firm that supports studios in creating &quot;compelling, professional voice performances&quot; via AI rather than professional – and real – voice actors. 

The report stopped short of revealing the minutiae of the arrangement, however, stating that &quot;the details of their partnership are under wraps&quot;.

                              <span>PUBG Mobile has released a new anti-cheat system that it says has already cut cheating by half.

Developer Krafton says the system, called Fog of War, &quot;helps mask the movements of other players from cheaters using x-ray vision/wall hacks&quot;, and states that during the testing period, cheating fell by 62 per cent in &quot;certain regions&quot;.  

&quot;The first of its kind in mobile gaming, Fog of War is an advanced anti-cheat system that limits the game information a player receives, reducing their ability to see players out of their field of view or through walls and objects,&quot; Krafton explains.

Our models and experimental results in a controlled lab setting show it is possible to reconstruct and recognize with over 75 percent accuracy on-screen texts that have heights as small as 10 mm with a 720p webcam.” That corresponds to 28 pt, a font size commonly used for headings and small headlines.

                              <span>Sly Cooper developer Sucker Punch has lifted the lid on a new line of merchandise to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary.


This range consists of a Sly plushy (seen in the header image), a print of some anniversary artwork by the original Sly Cooper&#x27;s art director Dev Madan and an anniversary T-shirt.


The artwork is certainly an impressive collection of nostalgia for Sly Cooper fans. Madan has rammed it full of references and Easter eggs from the last 20 years.

                              <span>A fresh batch of freebies has arrived on the Epic Games Store, with this week&#x27;s offerings coming in the form of dinosaur survival adventure Ark: Survival Evolved and the video game adaptation of acclaimed board game Gloomhaven.


This isn&#x27;t Ark: Survival Evolved&#x27;s first outing as an Epic freebie - it was given away in June 2020 - but if you&#x27;re a survival fan who hasn&#x27;t yet given it a look, it&#x27;s still probably worth checking out.


Released back in August 2017 after several years in early access, Ark&#x27;s base game offers a broadly compelling (if rather rickety) blend of dinosaur taming and breeding, base building, and survival meter management, all in service of massive-scale tribal warfare - unless you opt to join a PvE server, in which case your most terrifying foe is usually a pillar. Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic&#x27;s freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game&#x27;s rhythms, you might find more to your taste.

This sees fourteen Black Xbox employees offering up advice to others that are looking to get into the industry. Each will share insight into their jobs, as well as revealing some of their own career highlights.

Creative director Davide Soliani was initially told Rabbids were not to speak by Ubisoft. However, thanks to some creative manipulation of the rules and a successful bid by Soliani to &quot;gain trust&quot; from Ubisoft, Mario and his Rabbid companions will now talk during their upcoming escapades (thanks, IGN).


Let&#x27;s rewind back to the start to understand how this all came about.

&quot;Recently, we have seen increased harassment of our development team,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We welcome community input, however, the line between constructive feedback and the harassment of our dev team cannot be crossed.&quot;

Last night, I finished Return to Monkey Island. It was an amazing moment for me, and as I sat watching the credits roll with my heart feeling pleasantly full I saw a name make its way up the screen that I did not expect to see there - Neil Druckmann.


&quot;Neil Druckmann?&quot; my mind tried to compute, as my lips verbalised my amazement. Surely not the Neil Druckmann whose Ellie and Joel can be heard cussing left, right and centre in a game that is definitely not for children.

As you may have surmised from the headline already, this page sees all of Steam&#x27;s top games bundled together in one place. It will replace the usual Steam Stats many of you may be familiar with.


&quot;Today we&#x27;re launching Steam Charts, a new section of Steam that is dedicated to showing the most-played and top-selling games on Steam. Including numbers in real time,&quot; Valve said in a statement (thanks, Kotaku).

                              <span>Seven new patent filings from Destiny developer Bungie have been unearthed, predominantly all linked to virtual controls on touch-enabled devices, lending further credence to reports earlier this year that it had a Destiny mobile game in the works.


Those reports first surfaced back in July, when The Game Post, citing a source with knowledge of Chinese mobile developer NetEase&#x27;s plans, claimed the company was collaborating with Bungie to bring a completely new instalment in the Destiny series to mobile - a project said to have already been in development for several years.


It&#x27;s in this context that the seven newly unearthed Bungie patents (as spotted by The Game Post) prove particularly interesting. Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an &#x27;isometric/top-down&#x27; perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.

                              <span>Google&#x27;s Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.


Known as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico&#x27;s National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. 


This clearly can&#x27;t be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do &quot;love exploring&quot;. The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza.

                              <span>The GTA Forum, where this week&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto leaks occurred, has suggested the leak may have been the work of more than one person.


The initial leaker is known as Teapot and used the account @teapotuberhacker, but the forum believes another user, with the moniker Lily, also had access to this account.


It’s unclear whether this second user has access to any hacked material, though the forum believes this is not the case.

In Kubernetes 1.25, Validation rules for CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) have graduated to Beta!
Validation rules make it possible to declare how custom resources are validated using the Common Expression Language (CEL). For example:
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
 ...
 openAPIV3Schema:
 type: object
 properties:
 spec:
 type: object
 x-kubernetes-validations:
 - rule: &quot;self.minReplicas &lt;&#x3D; self.replicas &amp;&amp; self.replicas &lt;&#x3D; self.maxReplicas&quot;
 message: &quot;replicas should be in the range minReplicas..maxReplicas.&quot;
 properties:
 replicas:
 type: integer
 ...


Validation rules support a wide range of use cases. To get a sense of some of the capabilities, let&#x27;s look at a few examples:

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing video game leaks, following last weekend&#x27;s devastating hack of Rockstar Games which saw almost an hour of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage spilled onto the internet and promptly dissected by the masses.


The sheer fact Rockstar had been hacked in this manner was itself shocking - but the damage felt worse due to the negative comments this work-in-progress content then received. The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.

After that, we turn our attention to the YouTuber who accidentally outed themselves as being behind an &quot;insider&quot; Twitter account after posting under-wraps information they had been given by Ubisoft. Join Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan for their thoughts.

                              <span>As Microsoft starts to feel more heat from regulatory bodies over its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, CEO Satya Nadella has said he&#x27;s &quot;very confident” the deal will go through.


Governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition has grown in recent weeks, with the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority announcing it was moving to a more in-depth &quot;phase 2&quot; of its investigation, having determined the acquisition would give rise to the &quot;realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


Sony, too, has grown increasingly vocal over the proposed deal, particularly as it pertains to potential console exclusivity around the likes of Call of Duty. Early this month, for instance, PlayStation head Jim Ryan called Microsoft&#x27;s reassurances that the hugely popular shooter would remain on PS5 post-acquisition &quot;inadequate&quot;.

A running theme around the FIFA community is that every new game introduced players to their next favourite tune. And as the years go by, the tracks serve as a nostalgia trip to playing FIFA after a long day of school or work. 


Now EA has revealed the full track list for FIFA 23, and you can stream it all now in a dedicated Spotify playlist.

Bloody Ties - the first of two bits of story DLC currently confirmed as part of Dying Light 2&#x27;s five year journey of post-launch support - takes players to The Carnage Hall, an old opera house said to be the &quot;epicentre of death, wealth and absolute splendour&quot;. Here, they&#x27;ll find &quot;challenges and quests, surprising new weapon types, character interactions, and discoveries to uncover.&quot;


This initial bit of story DLC was originally expected to launch in June but was delayed to September for additional development. That date then slipped again, with Techland announcing a 13th October release date as August came to an end.

                              <span>A Pokémon and Ed Sheeran collaboration is happening, and it&#x27;ll be out next week.

This isn&#x27;t the first time the brand has paired up with Sheeran - he previously starred in a crossover event with Pokémon Go last year.

This time around, the collaboration will be in Sheeran&#x27;s area of expertise.

                              <span>PC players are rushing to find ways to download a popular Grand Theft Auto 4 mod compilation after it was taken down following a copyright infringement notice to the hosting site which provided access to the project. 


Grand Theft Auto IV - Definitive Edition is a project which complied a number of mods which aimed to enhance and update the game to run on modern PCs (thanks, PC Gamer). 


The game was last updated by Rockstar in 2020, when the developer removed the archaic Games for Windows Live DRM after it was shut down by Microsoft. However, this also had the unfortunate effect of disabling access to online multiplayer and leaderboards, which were run through the GFWL backend.

This listing (spotted by PSU) is for a scriptwriter and reads: &quot;Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience&quot;.


The post goes on to state that Ubisoft intends to &quot;keep the spirit and themes of the original game&quot; with this remake while &quot;exploring [its] characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable.&quot;

If you&#x27;re yet to try it, Spiritfarer is a memorable and moving adventure game where you shepard a crew of lost souls into the after life, while slowly upgrading your boat.


In a nutshell, it&#x27;s a &quot;cosy management game about dying&quot;, and one of my favourite games from 2020. If this news means more people get to play it - all the better!

The screenshot reel from a pre-release build of the game was found in the long-sought after 1996 Nintendo Company Report. 


The report, which has been carefully scanned and uploaded here, includes the standard yearly company round-up, plus some accompanying images of Nintendo&#x27;s star roster and various consoles including the Nintendo 64 and the destined for failure Virtual Boy.

Lenneth is an enhanced version of the original 1999 PS1 RPG Valkyrie Profile that was released on PSP in 2007 - its first release in the PAL region.


It was set for a re-release alongside the forthcoming action-RPG Valkyrie Elysium, available both separately and included in the deluxe edition, but now will arrive a little later.

This reception has, of course, not been missed by those at Lucasfilm Games, or more specifically, Craig Derrick who worked with Ron Gilbert and co to get the game released. 


Now, Derrick has shared his delight at all the positive feedback for Return to Monkey Island in a heartfelt Twitter thread. 


This alone is nice but not especially newsworthy. However, at the end of his thread, Derrick wrote some simple words that have caught the world&#x27;s eye: &quot;I&#x27;ll be standing by when it&#x27;s time to go BACK TO THE MANSION!&quot;

                              <span>The adorable fox-themed Tunic is making the leap to PlayStation and Switch soon. Ahead of these releases, its developer has shared some behind the scenes titbits about the game&#x27;s manual, including how a real one was made to ensure authenticity within the game


Sharing on the PlayStation Blog, Tunic&#x27;s lead developer Andrew Shouldice expressed his love for old-school game&#x27;s manuals. &quot;The more I thought about it though, the more I realised that my love for this kind of mystery came not just from the games, but from the manuals they were packaged with,&quot; Shouldice wrote, stating he would &quot;pore over these documents endlessly&quot;.


Such was Shouldice&#x27;s love for these manuals, he decided to incorporate one into Tunic&#x27;s gameplay. In this case, the player picks up pages for the manual as they make their way through the game&#x27;s mysterious word. These are then pieced together, allowing the player to uncover more of Tunic&#x27;s many (many) secrets.

                              <span>The Grand Theft Auto community has started to map out the game world of the next GTA game using leaks as their source. 


We know very little about the next game from official channels, but the huge leak on Monday gave us our biggest (albeit unfinished) look at the title. 


Moreover, with various reports reporting on the game&#x27;s location, characters and gameplay elements, there appears to be enough to go on to start the mapping process.

                              <span>Valorant will now flag bad behaviour in its end of game screen in an attempt to curb toxicity.


A new update has been released for the game, focused predominantly on changes to the Pearl map.


Yet nestled in the patch notes is a social update to add a &quot;disruptive gameplay-based behaviour indicator&quot;.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Nvidia announced its next series of GeForce RTX cards - and raised eyebrows at how much some of them will cost.


At the top end, the RTX 4090 will cost an eye-watering $1599. The RTX 4080 16GB will cost $1199, while the RTX 4080 12GB will cost $899.


Many had hoped for lower prices - but, according to Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, these costs reflect a world where Moore&#x27;s law - where performance is doubled for half the price every two years - is now &quot;dead&quot;.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s long-awaited new chapter is getting closer to its release - but it could have once been very different.
What we&#x27;re getting is a DLC package known as the Winters Expansion, which will include a third-person mode for the base game, a rework of the Mercenaries Mode which will introduce new playable characters such as Lady Dimitrescu, and the new story-based chapter known as Shadows of Rose.


Shadows of Rose will put Ethan Winters&#x27; daughter into the spotlight as she makes her way through the  consciousness of the Megamycete. This, Capcom has said, will conclude the Winters family story. However, Rose was not always going to be the focus of this story DLC. Instead, Capcom also had ideas for a Chris Redfield focused expansion.

Thankfully, Microsoft has heard your calls - over the noise of their own Xbox consoles, presumably - and is implementing an option to mute startup sounds entirely. Yes, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that Xbox swoosh to shoosh.


The choice of a silent startup is available now to those in Microsoft&#x27;s Alpha test ring for Xbox system software, meaning everyone else will likely follow suit within the next month.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s head of PlayStation Indies Shuhei Yoshida has said PS Plus should be used by publishers to manage the lifecycle of a game.


Speaking at GI Live: London (thanks GamesIndustry.biz), Yoshida discussed Sony&#x27;s approach to a subscription service, reiterating that the company still believes in the &quot;premium release of a title at launch&quot;.



Yet with PS Plus, Sony is offering a different approach as added value to developers and publishers.

The announcement comes after a steady increase in player count for Cyberpunk 2077. Previously, numbers for the game on Steam were on the rise, making it one of Steam&#x27;s top single-player games.

                              <span>Developer Asobo has released its latest Sim Update for the majestic Microsoft Flight Simulator, this one bringing, among other things, long-awaited DLSS support for PC.


Alongside DLSS anti-aliasing and upscaling, Asobo says Sim Update 10 should deliver &quot;stability, performance, and memory usage&quot; improvements for those using Flight Simulator&#x27;s in-development Direct X12 support - although it notes the new memory allocator will only be activated once Nvidia&#x27;s next GPU driver is released.


Elsewhere in today&#x27;s update, moving boats in the world now have a wake effect on PC, there&#x27;s a new cloud layer system - said to provide &quot;more vertical precision at low altitudes to better reflect the various cloud altitudes and thickness close to the ground&quot; - plus a number of quality of life features for Flight Simulator&#x27;s VFR map.

                              <span>Developer Jupiter has unveiled an eighth mainline instalment for its mighty Picross puzzle series on Switch, its big new addition being multiplayer support for up to four player when it launches next week. Furthermore, multiplayer and touchscreen support are reportedly being added to all previous Switch instalments at the same time.


Picross S8, as this newest entry is known, follows the same familiar formula as its predecessors - each stage requiring players to complete a picture on a grid by solving numerical clues indicating which squares must be filled in - but adds a bit of spice to proceedings by letting four players put their heads together to tackle each challenge.


According to the official Picross website, it&#x27;s local multiplayer only (the trailer suggests there&#x27;s a score-based component despite everyone working co-operatively to complete the same puzzle), and each player will need their own controller to participate.

                              <span>Gearbox has called the release of Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands a &quot;great victory&quot; for the studio, saying its success means it &quot;now clearly [has] a new franchise on its hands&quot;, with more &quot;experiences&quot; already in development.


Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands released back in March, taking the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2&#x27;s much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep and building it out into a full-length game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


It was generally well-received by critics on release - Eurogamer called it &quot;endearing&quot; despite its &quot;hodgepodge design&quot; - and it&#x27;s apparently been enough of a commercial success that Gearbox is now eager to do more.

                              <span>A month after Dark Souls 3&#x27;s Steam servers were finally bought online following more than seven months of downtime, they&#x27;re offline again, with publisher Bandai Namco confirming it&#x27;s currently &quot;investigating&quot; the issue.


The Dark Souls server woes began in January, when Bandai Namco was forced to disable servers for all Dark Souls games following reports of serious security concerns. Although the publisher described the situation as &#x27;temporary&#x27; at the time, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3&#x27;s servers finally coming back online at the end of August.


Unfortunately, the celebrations have been short-lived, and the game&#x27;s PvP servers are, as of yesterday, once again unavailable, preventing players from accessing any of its online features.

Customisation options for the Elite Wireless Controller Series 2&#x27;s Xbox button can be found in the latest version of the Xbox Accessories app on console and PC while a controller is connected. Here, users can visit the Colour tab to tinker with the Xbox button&#x27;s brightness, or use the menu sliders to pick one out of a possible 16 million hues.


In addition to button customisation, September&#x27;s Xbox update brings a revamp to the &#x27;My games and apps&#x27; Full library view on consoles, streamlining access to all games available to install and play. Furthermore, &#x27;All games&#x27; now displays every title a user has access to, including those on Game Pass, EA Access, and those claimed via Games with Gold.

                              <span>A cheat seller being sued by Bungie has launched a remarkable countersuit which claims Bungie hacked it.


The claim follows months of legal back and forth between cheat seller AimJunkies and Destiny developer Bungie, which has seen the former accused of both trademark and copyright infringement. 


AimJunkies has previously attempted to shrug off these claims, but has now gone one further. As reported by Torrentfreak, the cheat seller has now launched a countersuit which alleges Bungie accessed its computers for anti-cheat purposes via &quot;clandestine surveillance&quot; - effectively, that Bungie hacked it.

Call of the Sea - which initially launched for PC and consoles at the tail-end of 2020 - tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One&#x27;s Cissy Jones), as she investigates a beautiful South Pacific island, circa 1934, in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a captivating, often ingenious blend of story, exploration, and puzzling that successfully hits some powerful emotional beats even as it tips gently into cosmic weirdness.

It&#x27;s a music rhythm game where you play a trombone. Sounds simple, right?

You&#x27;d be wrong. Even though there&#x27;s some of the most famous classical pieces included, like Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony and Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, and even the national anthem, no amount of music knowledge will save you here.

Wingefors, whose company owns Saints Row developer Volition, acknowledged that views on the series&#x27; reboot had been &quot;polarised&quot; following its bug-laced release - in Eurogamer&#x27;s Saints Row review, Vikki Blake noted that its &#x27;Unto the Breach&#x27; mission was unplayable for her.


&quot;There are a lot of things that could be said and details around it. I&#x27;m happy to see a lot of gamers and fans happy. At the same time I&#x27;m a bit sad to see fans also not happy,&quot; Lars told investors (via Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo).

Writing on Twitter, the director of the ruling Taliban government&#x27;s media and information centre stated that the game would be blocked, alongside social app TikTok, for its effects on young people (thanks, PCGamesN). 


India, Pakistan, China and Jordan have also previously banned PUBG, whose mobile version specifically became particularly popular in these countries.

Players are tasked with documenting key animal behaviour to inform environmental research, mimicking that of natural history film-making researchers.

Light will now bounce around the settings, and &quot;be affected by the scene&#x27;s geometry and materials&quot;. Meanwhile, where shadows are being cast, these will be &quot;pixel perfect&quot;.


&quot;Portal&#x27;s unique selling point is the ability to take anything through a portal, and see through them, something that hadn&#x27;t been done before its release,&quot; Nvidia elaborated. &quot;With ray tracing, light can pass through portals, too. Even the light from the moving High Energy Pellets will cast through portals, causing shadows to shift in step.&quot; You can see a little preview of Portal with RTX below.

                              <span>UPDATE: Warner Bros. Games has responded to Eurogamer with a statement in response to previous investigations into sexual harassment at the studio. Below in full: 
&quot;Investigations found there was no evidence substantiating the allegations of this former employee who resigned in 2019. We stand against all forms of harassment and take any allegation extremely seriously. We support those who have concerns they wish to raise. We therefore took the necessary time to thoroughly investigate allegations at Rocksteady Studios with the utmost integrity. 
&quot;An external, independent law firm conducted a full and thorough investigation, including interviewing current and former employees, not only researching past allegations, but also examining the current culture of the studio. Furthermore, a Warner Bros. Discovery (then Warner Media) People Relations team, independent of the games division, diligently researched and investigated any allegations raised.

                              <span>New footage filmed on the show floor of E3 1999 has been posted on YouTube, and gives us one of the closest looks yet at the cut &quot;Perfect Head&quot; feature from N64 gem Perfect Dark.

Perfect Head would have allowed players to scan a face into the game using the camera on a Game Boy, which could then be mapped onto a multiplayer character&#x27;s head. The feature was complete and functional, but was removed from the game for its release. 

In an 2020 interview conducted by our own Wesley Yin-Poole, several of the developers revealed it had been removed at Nintendo&#x27;s request due to the recent Columbine High School massacre and concerns over the feature&#x27;s potential uses.

                              <span>A new and detailed report by Bloomberg has highlighted the numbers of children who stream on Twitch, and the number of accounts linked to adult predators who follow and interact with them.


Research includes various examples of children being asked by adult users to engage in explicit or inappropriate activities and perform dances or &quot;dares&quot; while live-streaming. After said streams have ended, the recordings are often viewed by hundreds of other accounts - far more than expected for small channels their size.


The report suggests this is due to &quot;hundreds&quot; of accounts believed to be used by predators, which have collated follower lists each with &quot;more than 1000 kids on their following lists&quot;.

M_S_1 said they took inspiration from the featured games&#x27; concept art for their covers, calling it &quot;a bit more timeless&quot; to work from. &quot;A character render with modern graphics would look pretty jarring for the era,&quot; they explained.

The revenue split between Twitch and streamers has long been an issue, with many claiming the current 50/50 split is stifling the growth of smaller channels.


The UserVoice post, begun by streamer SaltyWyvern in 2020, became the most voted issue on the platform as it requested Twitch change the revenue split to 70/30 (like main rival YouTube). This has now been closed by Twitch.

The highlight here is Infinity Ward&#x27;s explanation for Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s divisive mini-map, which has come under fire from some players for failing to provide enough information on enemy players.


Unlike some previous Call of Duty games, Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s mini-map only shows enemy player dots when a UAV is active. This means it does not display red dots when enemy players sprint or fire their weapons.

Vlambeer co-founder Rami Ismail was among those who spoke out about the game, and who shared a detailed thread of criticism posted on ResetEra.


&quot;Why don&#x27;t you for once just hire some Arabs [and] locals to ensure the places you seem to insist you gotta blow us up in would at least pass the critical gaze of say, a three-year-old,&quot; Ismail wrote on Twitter. &quot;This is embarrassing to game development as a whole.&quot;

                              <span>Co-operative time-travel puzzler The Past Within - the latest entry in developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s wonderfully sinister puzzle-adventure series - finally has a release date and will be coming to PC, Mac, iOS, and Android on 2nd November.


Developer Rusty Lake has released 14 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner to date - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - each delivering a deliciously surreal, narratively interconnected slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant.


The Past Within is Rusty Lake&#x27;s first attempt at a co-operative adventure, expanding the series&#x27; familiar formula, both spacially and temporally, as two players work together across different timelines - one located in the past, the other in the future - to solve the mysteries surrounding recurring series character Albert Vanderboom.

On seeing this leaked footage, some corners of the internet decided to use it as ammunition to criticise Rockstar&#x27;s unfinished work.


&quot;If you knew how game development goes, you&#x27;d know that visuals are one of the first things done. This game is four years into planning and development. What you see is almost exactly what you will get. The next year is mission coding and debugging. All backend stuff. It does look ass,&quot; claimed one Twitter user.

Allen gained brief internet fame by leaking details of Ubisoft&#x27;s various Assassin&#x27;s Creed announcements - details which he had been given by Ubisoft itself to prepare content while under embargo.

                              <span>This is a fascinating glimpse of the future of automatic cheating detection in sports:
Maybe you heard about the truly insane false-start controversy in track and field? Devon Allen—a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles—was disqualified from the 110-meter hurdles at the World Athletics Championships a few weeks ago for a false start.
Here’s the problem: You can’t see the false start. Nobody can see the false start. By sight, Allen most definitely does not leave before the gun.
But here’s the thing: World Athletics has determined that it is not possible for someone to push off the block within a tenth of a second of the gun without false starting. They have science that shows it is beyond human capabilities to react that fast. Of course there are those (I’m among them) who would tell you that’s nonsense, that’s pseudoscience, there’s no way that they can limit human capabilities like that. There is science that shows it is humanly impossible to hit a fastball. There was once science that showed human beings could not run a four-minute mile...</span>

Kubernetes v1.25, released earlier this month, introduced a new feature
that lets your cluster expand storage volumes, even when access to those
volumes requires a secret (for example: a credential for accessing a SAN fabric)
to perform node expand operation. This new behavior is in alpha and you
must enable a feature gate (CSINodeExpandSecret) to make use of it.
You must also be using CSI
storage; this change isn&#x27;t relevant to storage drivers that are built in to Kubernetes.
To turn on this new, alpha feature, you enable the CSINodeExpandSecret feature
gate for the kube-apiserver and kubelet, which turns on a mechanism to send secretRef
configuration as part of NodeExpansion by the CSI drivers thus make use of
the same to perfor…</span>

                              <span>Star Citizen, the controversial space sim from developer Cloud Imperium Games, has now raised more than half a billion dollars in funding from backers.


Star Citizen&#x27;s exceedingly lengthy development is well-documented, with the game still in alpha over a decade after production began. And while it&#x27;s attracted some private funding in that time, the overwhelming bulk has come via crowdfunding, beginning with a successful $2m USD Kickstarter in 2012 and ballooning from there.


As of today, Star Citizen has amassed $500,075,150 USD in crowdfunding from a total of 4,096,384 backers, according to the official Roberts Space Industries website. Its previous major milestone of $400m USD raised was reached last November, meaning it&#x27;s taken a further ten months to accrue an additional $100m.

                              <span>Apple has announced it will be raising its App Store prices in multiple territories - including every country that uses the euro, but excluding the UK at present - starting on 5th October.


As per an update shared with developers, which did not provide an explanation for the impending price hike, Apple said the move will impact all tiers of its App Store pricing chart in the following areas: Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Vietnam, and all territories that use the euro currency. 


When the pricing changes come into effect on 5th October, App Store items previously priced at €0.99 will, for instance, increase to €1.19, while apps formerly costing €9.99 will rise to €11.99. App Store developers who offer subscriptions will, however, have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.

Hints of an impending crossover with the award-winning Apple TV+ comedy series first emerged last week, when a listing for AFC Richmond - the fictional London team managed by Ted Lasso in the show - briefly appeared on EA&#x27;s FIFA ratings database  before being removed.


That might have been the end of it, but now the official Ted Lasso Twitter account has shared an image showing what appears to be Ted Lasso actor Jason Sudeikis, albeit from behind, ensconced in the FIFA team&#x27;s facial capture rig - used to digitise the real-world likeness of players (and, for the first time this year, managers) for use in-game.

                              <span>Earlier today, Nvidia finally revealed the new RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 video cards, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. We&#x27;ve been hands-on with the RTX 4090 for the last few days and we&#x27;re hard at work on content focusing on the firm&#x27;s latest AI-based frame generation technology - DLSS 3.
First impressions on the RTX 4090 itself though? It&#x27;s easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we&#x27;ve seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you&#x27;re one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.
We were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we&#x27;re not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we&#x27;ve put together a teaser video showing some of the work we&#x27;ve already done.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s new season is now underway, after kicking off on Sunday with a fresh cinematic that finally unmasks Brie Larson as a key character. 


For several months now, Larson has been voicing the role of Paradigm, one of the game&#x27;s heroic Seven. The Captain Marvel actress debuted as Paradigm in Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 3 Season 2 live event, where she commanded players as they took control of the game&#x27;s infamous bear mech. 


Larson has regularly popped up since, voicing audio logs and mission chatter for Fortnite&#x27;s weekly tasks through the recently-concluded Chapter 3 Season 3. Now, with the launch of Season 4, we&#x27;ve seen her with her helmet off for the first time.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has responded to a claim by the two former hosts of YouTube series Nintendo Minute, that the company would not let them feature a &quot;Nuzlocke&quot; run during an episode.

Nintendo Minute was a weekly series which ended in December 2021. The show was hosted by former PR managers for Nintendo of America Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang. Since Nintendo Minute ended, the pair both left Nintendo and went on to create their own podcast.

In episode 31 of Kit and Krysta Podcast, when responding to questions submitted through Patreon, Ellis and Yang recalled a time when they had brought up the idea of a Nuzlocke run to The Pokémon Company.

                              <span>A new teaser for Netflix&#x27;s Sonic Prime show has been unveiled by Sega. 


This trailer sees everyone&#x27;s favourite blue blur being incredibly blue and blurry as he makes his way through the world. Oh, and Shadow and Doctor Eggman are also hot on his heels. 


Along with this teaser, which you can see below, Sega has assured us that Sonic will &quot;shatter&quot; our worlds when Sonic Prime airs this winter on Netflix. And yes, I feel quite agitated writing about a Netflix show with the word &#x27;Prime&#x27; in its title.

                              <span>Nvidia has announced its latest generation of GeForce RTX graphics cards at its GTC AI conference. The Nvidia RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are the first GPUs from the &#x27;Ada Lovelace&#x27; series, and they should be up to twice as fast as their last-gen counterparts in rasterised games - and up to four times as fast in ray-traced games.  
The RTX 4090 24GB will be available on October 12th and costs $1599/£1679, while the RTX 4080 16GB arrives in November and costs $1199/£1269. There&#x27;s also an RTX 4080 12GB model that costs $899/£949. The 4090 and 4080 are reportedly two to four times faster than their Ampere equivalents, which are the 3090 Ti and the 3080 Ti, respectively. 
Note that Nvidia RTX 30-series cards will remain on sale for the moment, filling in the bottom part of the market until lower-tier RTX 40-series GPUs arrive.

                              <span>EA has confirmed it is developing a single-player third-person action adventure Iron Man game as part of a new collaboration between it and Marvel for &quot;several&quot; new projects.


The game - which is yet to be titled - is in the works at Star Wars Squadrons studio Motive, which is also developing the upcoming Dead Space remake.


The project still seems some way off, and EA lists it as in pre-production. As with other recent early announcements, the confirmation appears to have been made to spur recuitment on the game (and also follows earlier whispers of its existence).

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man made its way to PC earlier in the year, and along with it a multitude of mods have swung onto the scene. 


Now, one such mod has given the game a literal face lift, by replacing the new model of Peter Parker with that of the game&#x27;s original PlayStation 4 one. 


This mod was uploaded to Nexus mods by DaigronCDM. Known as the &#x27;John Bubniak - PS4 face restoration mod&#x27;, it does exactly as you&#x27;d expect. It makes Peter Parker look more like John Bubniak, Spidey&#x27;s original face model before the character was redesigned to look more like actor Yuri Lowenthal.

The online requirements for Xbox games have previously come under fire for being unclear and rendering downloaded and offline games unplayable during service outages. 

Microsoft has recently made a quiet change to the checks made when launching games on Xbox Series X. For anyone making good use of the Series X&#x27;s backwards compatibility, there are now no online DRM checks for Xbox One discs. (Of course, this was not an issue on the disc-less Series S.)

This mechanic, spotted by VGC, now offers players the opportunity to switch game regions from 50Hz PAL (a notably slower standard) to NTSC 60Hz through Syphon Filter 2&#x27;s settings menu.


You can see how this process looks in the image below.

Of course, this batch is undoubtedly headlined by the long-awaited arrival of Deathloop, the full version of Grounded, and indie hit Valheim on PC.


Parents and the young at heart may also be pleased to see new release Paw Patrol Grand Prix is also part of this latest update. The popular pups&#x27; take on Mario Kart joins Game Pass next week.

The same attacker also said they were behind last week&#x27;s high-profile hack of ride app Uber, which has provided an update on its own investigations.

Butterfly Soup 2 is due to launch on 29th October, and will follow the four main characters a few months after the original story.

We&#x27;ve previously featured Butterfly Soup in a piece by Natalie Flores on the humanisation of queer women through humour in games, and Butterfly Soup has this in spades.

Talking to IGN, Director Kento Kinoshita stated Capcom is &quot;creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga.&quot;


This means any future entries to the series will likely introduce us to a new set of characters or bring back some older faces from the previous generations of games - though Capcom itself is tight-lipped on any further details.

Wilson issued the comment at a financial event organised by Goldman Sachs (transcribed by Seeking Alpha), where he contrasted Call of Duty&#x27;s situation with that of Battlefield - the latter of which, he boasted, was &quot;platform agnostic&quot;.


&quot;In a world where there may be questions over the future of Call of Duty and what platforms that might be on or might not be on, being platform agnostic and completely cross-platform with Battlefield, I think is a tremendous opportunity,&quot; Wilson said.

As with previous leaks from August, this footage appears to have originated from the ongoing Friend and Family beta version of the game - something that is labelled as a &quot;private test build&quot;. 


The latest leaks were uploaded to reddit and show a total of 43 minutes of gameplay footage. This  work-in-progress  footage includes the map, various cosmetic options and a variety of attacks - though is all subject to change before the release of the full game.

The report, by Insider Gaming, suggests the console will otherwise have near-identical hardware to current PS5 models, with the only difference being the removable drive itself, and an extra USB-C port for it to plug in.


There&#x27;s also the suggestion this new console will be sold both on its own and with the detachable disc drive included.

                              <span>Rockstar has acknowledged the enormous Grand Theft Auto 6 leak of work-in-progress development materials that took place over the weekend.
In a statement published this afternoon on Twitter, as the company returned to work, Rockstar admitted it had suffered a &quot;network intrusion&quot; - a hack - from which the early development footage of GTA 6 had been taken.
Rockstar said it hoped the hack would have no impact on its live services - such as GTA Online - and insisted the leak would not impact the development of the game long-term. Still, Rockstar acknowleged it was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; at what had happened.

                              <span>The Washington Post is reporting that the US Customs and Border Protection agency is seizing and copying cell phone, tablet, and computer data from “as many as” 10,000 phones per year, including an unspecified number of American citizens. This is done without a warrant, because “…courts have long granted an exception to border authorities, allowing them to search people’s devices without a warrant or suspicion of a crime.”
CBP’s inspection of people’s phones, laptops, tablets and other electronic devices as they enter the country has long been a controversial practice that the agency has defended as a low-impact way to pursue possible security threats and determine an individual’s “intentions upon entry” into the U.S. But the revelation that thousands of agents have access to a searchable database without public oversight is a new development in what privacy advocates and some lawmakers warn could be an infringement of Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures...</span>

Local ephemeral storage capacity isolation was introduced as a alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.7 and it went beta in 1.9. With Kubernetes 1.25 we are excited to announce general availability(GA) of this feature.
Pods use ephemeral local storage for scratch space, caching, and logs. The lifetime of local ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the individual pod. It is exposed to pods using the container’s writable layer, logs directory, and EmptyDir volumes. Before this feature was introduced, there were issues related to the lack of local storage accounting and isolation, such as Pods not knowing how much local storage is available and being unable to request guaranteed local storage. Local storage is a best-effort resource and pods can be evicted due t…</span>

In a brief statement about it on Halo Waypoint, 343i said that whilst it knew &quot;many players have enjoyed this new mode&quot;, it had been &quot;steadily declining&quot; and &quot;starting to fall short of the quality bar&quot;. Consequently, the dedicated playlist will be &quot;rotated out&quot; and will instead &quot;roll into Quick Play&quot; at the beginning of November.

&quot;On Tuesday, Sept. 20, the dedicated Land Grab playlist will be rotated out of matchmaking,&quot; the blog post reveals. &quot;While we know many players have enjoyed this new mode introduced in Season 2, at this stage it’s been steadily declining and starting to fall short of the quality bar for a positive player experience.

This means that new games coming to what would&#x27;ve been the &quot;Yakuza&quot; series will carry the &quot;Like a Dragon&quot; name instead.

Confirmation comes by way of Sega, which confirmed to Kotaku that as the Like a Dragon branding is &quot;more closely align with the Japanese name&quot;, it is formally dropping the Yakuza name from every new title going forward.

As spotted by PC Gamer, Wizard101 was forced into unscheduled downtime in order to address in-game messages changed to read &quot;this game is shit&quot; and &quot;dick and balls&quot;, amongst others.

&quot;Wizard101 servers have been temporarily shut down due to an unexpected issue,&quot; the company tweeted yesterday. &quot;We will keep everyone updated on when they will be back up. Thank you for your patience.&quot;

                              <span>It looks like a new Final Fantasy 16 trailer may debut next month.

Though not set in stone, of course, producer/director Naoki Yoshida spoke at Tokyo Games Show and teased that Square Enix will &quot;probably release the trailer next month&quot;.

“I haven’t gotten a chance to talk to the marketing or public relations teams at all, so I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say, but I think we’ll probably be able to release the next trailer next month or so,&quot; Yoshida said (thanks, Gematsu).

                              <span>An Elden Ring board game is on the way.

Steamforged Games - the team behind the Horizon Zero Dawn, Resident Evil, and Dark Souls tabletop games - will be launching a Kickstarter campaign &quot;soon&quot; to bring the officially-sanctioned board game adaptation to fruition. 

&quot;Like the video game, the Elden Ring board game will immerse players in the forsaken Lands Between,&quot; explains a press release from the company. &quot;In a vast, sprawling world of decaying grandeur that unfolds through their exploration, 1-4 ‘Tarnished’ players will embark on a huge and varied adventure, visiting iconic locations and crossing paths with familiar enemies and characters.&quot;

                              <span>90+ screenshots and videos reportedly taken from GTA 6 have leaked online.

Whilst there&#x27;s no way of authenticating them, the initially hostile response on the GTA Forums eventually softened as posters began to believe that the leaked assets were genuine.

Whilst, naturally, the unfinished game has missing assets and features, the videos give a rudimentary peek at the protagonists, the open world, and even the shooter&#x27;s combat, totalling over seven minutes&#x27; worth of unsanctioned footage.

                              <span>Phil Spencer wants you to know that Microsoft hasn&#x27;t &quot;given up&quot; on bringing Final Fantasy 14 – currently only available on Sony consoles – to Xbox.

It&#x27;s been three years since Spencer first mentioned plans to bring Square Enix&#x27;s fan-favourite MMO to Xbox and while there&#x27;s been no movement, Spencer gave &quot;a commitment&quot; that the company was still trying to make it happen.

&quot;Hahaha, I did say that,&quot; he laughed when asked by Game Watch if he remembered talking about it way back in 2019.

                              <span>Valve is showing off Steam Deck&#x27;s unreleased dock at Tokyo Game Show.

Though the Steam Deck Steam page mentions the dock and still invites interested players to wishlist the item, we&#x27;ve not seen nor heard much about it since Valve began shipping its sought-after handheld system.

As spotted by NME, Valve has the dock on display at Tokyo Game Show, giving fans a chance to check out the new kit and count - and argue about - those all-important ports on the back, which crucially  seem to show just one USB-C port, which is for the power cable.

                              <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn has nerfed the Heat Sink skin iron sights and says it is &quot;improving the competitive integrity of iron sights now and in the future&quot;.

In an update posted to the game&#x27;s official website (via Reddit), Respawn responded to players&#x27; reports that some of the battle royale&#x27;s weapon skins offered an unfair competitive advantage when aiming down sights.

&quot;Competitive integrity is and will always be a core pillar for Apex Legends,&quot; Respawn said. &quot;As part of that, our default iron sights are designed to push players to loot for better optics. We also believe that skins shouldn&#x27;t be a factor in the sights functionality as well.

                              <span>Like a Dragon: Ishin will only feature Japanese voice acting, producer Masayoshi Yokoyama has confirmed.

In an interview with Yakuza fan site Tojo Dojo, Yokoyama revealed that whilst the Yakuza series has sometimes offered English voice-acting, Like a Dragon: Ishin&#x27;s &quot;specialised vocabulary [...] would make the lines incredibly long&quot;, so the game will be translated into English via subtitles.

“No, [Western players] don’t really watch subtitled content,&quot; Yokoyama acknowledged in the interview (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;Especially in English speaking countries. That’s why they prefer to have voice overs.

The new &quot;special collaboration&quot; with McLaren will run until 1st November for PC players and 9th for those PUBG-ing on console, and introduce a load of McLaren flavoured goodies, including a McLaren GT Standard - Onyx Black vehicle skin, costume, gear, emote, and &quot;more via in-game McLaren Loot Caches&quot;.

Players can also tart up the Coupe RB with McLaren skins &quot;through the new vehicle interaction feature&quot; although fair warning: the skins &quot;do not affect the performance of the vehicle&quot;. Sorry.

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment head and Battlefield franchise boss Vince Zampella has spoken about the reception - and failure - of the series&#x27; most recent entry, Battlefield 2042, suggesting it &quot;strayed too far from&quot; its roots.


Battlefield 2042 was dogged by technical issues and controversial design decisions when it launched last year, quickly attracting overwhelmingly negative reviews from players on Steam.


Since then, developer DICE has continued to tweak and expand on Battlefield 2042&#x27;s wobbly base, but it&#x27;s often felt like too little, too late - with publisher EA admitting the game&#x27;s sales &quot;did not meet expectations&quot;, saying, &quot;Some of the design choices we made...did not resonate with everyone in our community&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has revealed its upcoming PSVR2 headset for PlayStation 5 won&#x27;t be compatible with games for the original PSVR.


That&#x27;s according to PlayStation&#x27;s SVP of platform experience, Hideaki Nishino, speaking in the latest episode of the Official PlayStation Podcast (jump to the 29:10 mark). &quot;PSVR games are not compatible with PSVR2,&quot; he explained in answer to a question from the host, &quot;because PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next-generation VR experience&quot;. 


Elaborating further, Nishino claimed the new elements of the PVSR2 hardware - inside-out tracking and eye-tracking, 3D audio, a 4K HDR display, and its controller with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback - meant &quot;developing games for PSVR2 requires a whole different approach than the original PSVR.&quot;

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 closed beta announcement, Capcom has now revealed the full 18-strong character roster coming to the fighting series&#x27; latest instalment on launch day.


Previously, Capcom had confirmed 11 of the characters set to be playable in Street Fighter 6, offering a mix of familiar faces and brand-new additions. The iconic likes of Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, and Guile were all confirmed to be in, alongside more recent additions Juri and Luke. And as for newcomers, &quot;self-styled Chinatown peacekeeper&quot; Jamie and &quot;devoted student to Bushinryu&quot; Kimberly were both confirmed to be along for the ride.


As of today, though, that earlier 11-strong line-up has seen seven more additions, with Capcom having now announced Street Fighter 6&#x27;s full launch day roster. Series stalwarts Zangief, Cammy, and Dee Jay are all present and correct, and the list of newcomers is complete with Manon, Marisa, Lily, and JP.

                              <span>There&#x27;s good news for PlayStation-owning fans of developer Team Cherry&#x27;s sublime Metroidvania, Hollow Knight. Its feverishly anticipated sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, has finally been confirmed for release on PS4 and PS5.


Hollow Knight: Silksong has, of course, been a long time coming, with Team Cherry first announcing the game all the way back in February 2019. Even now, some three and a half years later, specifics around Silksong remain limited, but we do at least know it&#x27;ll offer a twist on its predecessor&#x27;s non-linear exploration, platforming, and combat thanks to a new protagonist, Hornet, with her own distinct abilities.


Given how very excellent the original Hollow Knight was, that&#x27;s still more than enough to warrant excitement, and Switch, Xbox, and PC players have been able to rest easy knowing Silksong would - eventually, at least - be available on their system to play.

                              <span>After nearly eight years in development, an ambitious VR mod for Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter Half-Life 2 finally launches on Steam today as a public beta.


Created by a group of modders going by the name of Source VR Mod Team, Half-Life 2: VR Mod has had a bit of a bumpy journey to release. Eurogamer first reported on the project back in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra in 2013. Some time after, it disappeared into what the team recently called &quot;its own kind of development hell&quot;, almost being abandoned, but eventually re-emerged in 2021.


The wait continued until last month, when Source VR Mod Team announced that, thanks to a &quot;new influx of team members [that] revitalised&quot; development, the Half-Life 2: VR project was poised to release, and that day is now here.

                              <span>The hype around the recently announced Like a Dragon: Ishin! remake is very real, and two new trailers from Sega show off the upgraded graphics, plus what new content has been added by developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.

There are two new trailers for us to digest, so let&#x27;s get into it!

A gameplay trailer, posted on the Japanese Like a Dragon YouTube channel, focuses on Ryoma Sakamoto&#x27;s (or Kazuma Kiryu&#x27;s historical counterpart) fighting styles (embedded below).

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was named on screen during the latest Nintendo Direct - but many fans still had questions.


Namely, was that &quot;tears&quot; as in crying? Or &quot;tears&quot; as in something being torn up?

                              <span>We learned this week that brilliant GameCube role-playing game Tales of Symphonia was getting a re-release on modern consoles - but fans have now expressed disappointment at the fact it will run at a locked 30fps. 


The detail, listed on the game&#x27;s new Japanese website, has raised eyebrows since Symphonia on GameCube was presented in largely 60fps (with 30fps only for the world map).


Instead, this new remaster features a blanket 1080p 30fps across all three platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

With so many announcements, it&#x27;s easy to get lost in what&#x27;s already out and what&#x27;s available when. 

Here&#x27;s a quick reminder of everything new that was announced for Game Pass this week.

                              <span>A mod for Cyberpunk 2077 enables Night City&#x27;s vehicles to take to the skies.


The mod in question comes from Jack Humbert on Nexus Mods (via PC Gamer). Named &#x27;Let there be flight&#x27;, this mod &quot;enables a configurable flight system for all vehicles with custom thruster models, visual &amp; sound effects, and animations.&quot;


This adds something to Cyberpunk 2077 that many had hoped would have been included on the game&#x27;s initial release almost two years ago.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has reiterated that Microsoft has no plans to raise the price of its consoles - after Sony stunned fans last month by hiking the price of PlayStation 5.


Speaking overnight to CNBC, Spencer noted the current economic issues many were facing, and said Xbox didn&#x27;t think it &quot;was the right move for us at this point&quot; to follow suit.


&quot;In a time when our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right move for us at this point to be raising prices on our consoles,&quot; Spencer said.

&quot;It&#x27;s time to Build a Zoo,&quot; reads the press release. &quot;Construct and decorate enclosures, buy and breed animals, hire zookeepers and vets... then try your hand at DNA splicing, and stitch together over 500,000 different types of animal. This can only go smoothly...&quot;


Splicing, did you say? Well, yes, yes I did! In Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, players can quite literally mix things up during any given playthrough. On its console release, new players will be able to exhibit a whole myriad of unusual beings. After all, who wouldn&#x27;t want to see a crocoduck if the opportunity presented itself.

Spencer appeared on CNBC overnight and was questioned over Sony&#x27;s recent comments on the deal - including pushback from PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who previously branded Microsoft&#x27;s reassurances around the future of Call of Duty as &quot;inadequate&quot;. 


When asked whether Microsoft was prepared to go further than its recently-stated pledge - to keep COD on PlayStation for several more years - and perhaps promise it would remain on PlayStation in perpetuity, Spencer said his expectation was that Xbox would &quot;continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation and other places&quot;.

It feels a bit wild to be making this statement nearly two years after the game came out.

According to SteamDB, yesterday the number concurrent players in Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam peaked at 37,000, beating out Elden Ring on 31,000 and mostly topped by titles with a huge multiplayer base such as Grand Theft Auto 5 and Destiny 2.

&quot;With Star Wars Eclipse we&#x27;re certainly going to keep the fundamental elements of a Quantic Dream game,&quot; he explained.

                              <span>Three more classic Mega Drive games have been added to Nintendo Switch Online for Expansion Pack members.


And they are: Earthworm Jim, Alisia Dragoon, and The Story of Thor (known as Beyond Oasis in the US).


Earthworm Jim is the most well known of these, a 90s character platformer about a humanoid worm in a space suit (look, it was the &#x27;90s...), but don&#x27;t sleep on those other two.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a comeback we weren&#x27;t expecting: 35-year old arcade rail shooter Operation Wolf is back in action.


French publisher Microids announced the imminent release of Operation Wolf Returns: First Mission, officially licensed by Taito and due out on consoles this autumn. It&#x27;s also coming to VR in 2023.


All we have on this new game for now is a handful of screenshots, below, which show a new cartooney art style compared to the cult classic late-&#x27;80s arcade shooter. I&#x27;m sure this one&#x27;s going to prove divisive.

                              <span>It’s big:
The breach appeared to have compromised many of Uber’s internal systems, and a person claiming responsibility for the hack sent images of email, cloud storage and code repositories to cybersecurity researchers and The New York Times.
“They pretty much have full access to Uber,” said Sam Curry, a security engineer at Yuga Labs who corresponded with the person who claimed to be responsible for the breach. “This is a total compromise, from what it looks like.”

It looks like a pretty basic phishing attack; someone gave the hacker their login credentials. And because Uber has lousy internal security, lots of people have access to everything. So once a hacker gains a foothold, they have access to everything...</span>

                              <span>Outer Wilds, the stellar time loop adventure - and Eurogamer Game of the Year 2019 - from developer Mobius Digital, has just received a next-gen upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Outer Wilds, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, casts players as tentative space explorers, slinging them into a miniature solar system of bizarre planets, absolutely stuffed with secrets. There&#x27;s little direction, only a breadcrumb trail of clues hinting at a much larger mystery, and it all gradually opens out into glorious puzzle box, as ingenious as it is hauntig. And that&#x27;s even before you start to grapple with the ramifications of the solar system resetting itself every 20 minutes.


It&#x27;s great, then, but while Outer Wilds has technically been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S before now via backward compatibility, &quot;playing...was not recommended because players could run into sections that weren’t optimised for the next-gen consoles, and encounter other backwards compatibility issues such as controller input lag&quot; - as Mobius explains in a new post.

                              <span>Capcom has shared more details on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s next free Title Update, which will introduce the likes of the Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos when it comes to Switch and PC on 29th September.


When Capcom previously discussed Title Update 2 at the end of last month, it confirmed that monster variant Flaming Espinas would be one ofits new additions. It&#x27;s now announced two additional variants for the release - the aforementioned Violet Mizutsune and Risen Chameleos - both appering in its latest update trailer.


There&#x27;s not much information about the Violet Mizutsune just yet, but the Risen Chameleos is described as an Elder Dragon that has &quot;overcome the affliction by achieving symbiosis with the Qurio, gaining great strength and new abilities&quot;. As such, it &quot;poses an even greater danger than when they were still under the influence of the affliction&quot; - so tread carefully.

                              <span>Saturnalia - the striking multi-character survival horror from acclaimed developer Santa Ragione - finally has a release date, and will be inviting PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC players into its ever-shifting labyrinth on 27th October.


We&#x27;re big fans of Santa Ragione&#x27;s previous work, which includes MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, around these parts, and Saturnalia sounds just as intriguing. It&#x27;s a survival horror adventure, of sorts - one heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - that sees players guiding four different characters through a mysterious ancient village steeped in murky rituals.


The goal of Saturnalia is to investigate, and ultimately solve, the mystery of village, but there are shadowy things in the night determined to stop you. Should you get captured as one character, you can switch to another and attempt a rescue - but once all four characters are dead, the village gets to reassert itself, its labyrinthine layout physically reconfiguring for another attempt. Narrative and puzzle progress, however, is retained across game-overs.

                              <span>Following tonight&#x27;s big Call of Duty blowout we finally have a release date for the much-anticipated Warzone 2.0 - plus we&#x27;ve plenty more details on what to expect. 


Warzone 2.0 is set to launch on 16th November, some two weeks after the launch of Modern Warfare 2 on 28th October. The pair will share the same engine, a first for the Call of Duty franchise and one that should ensure parity and a more consistent feature set - all of which makes this feel like something of a new dawn for the series. Warzone 2.0 introduces the new desert map of Al Mazrah, plus some of its own twists on the battle royale formula such as multiple circles appearing in certain end-game scenarios. It&#x27;ll also feature a new AI faction, with Strong Holds harbouring loot patrolled by NPCs, and a tweaked Gulag system. There will also be a new sandbox mode called DMZ, and while details remain slim it does indeed sound like Warzone&#x27;s take on Escape from Tarkov. 


Like other popular battle royale titles it will also feature a third-person view - something entirely new for Warzone 2.0, and an addition that will likely be the subject of some debate. Third-person playlists will also be available in Modern Warfare 2, harking back to the third-person mode that was available in the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009.

                              <span>Lego Bricktales, the beautiful diorama-based puzzler from developer ClockStone, finally has a release date and will be coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 12th October.


Announced back in March, Lego Bricktales sees players traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they, with the assistant of a cute robot pal, embark on a quest to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


The ensuing adventure offers a blend of puzzling and questing based around Lego Bricktales&#x27; brick-by-brick building mechanic, challenging players to come up with a solution to a particular task at hand by building something from a limited number of bricks - a bridge to cross a river, for instance, or a flyable, physics-based gyrocopter.

                              <span>Norco, the acclaimed southern gothic adventure from developer Geography of Robots, will be making the jump from PC to PlayStation and Xbox next month, arriving on 20th October.


Norco unfolds in the &quot;sinking suburbs and verdant industrial swamps&quot; of a surreal, future South Louisiana, where players - in the role of a rebellious teenage girl - embark on a quest to find their brother, Blake, missing after the death of their mother.


What follows is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure, but one that aims in all sorts of directions, with Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell somewhat futilely summing it up as a &quot;text-adventure, turn-based party battler, boat-navigating... poem... puzzler?&quot; in his review.

Series veterans Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim and E. Honda were all confirmed as returning characters to the roster. Footage of the Battle Hub showed a game centre full of arcade cabinets for players to compete against one another.

                              <span>We&#x27;re back again this week for another Eurogamer Newscast, focusing on the recent Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play, plus the week&#x27;s big news on the Yakuza franchise and what&#x27;s next from Xbox Game Pass. It&#x27;s been a busy week - full of Zelda, Pikmin, God of War and Yakuza 8 - but some corners of the internet are disappointed.


True, we didn&#x27;t see some of the things we had expected might materialise. This week was not when we saw Wind Waker on Switch, Silent Hill on PlayStation, or got some kind of assurance Nintendo remembered what Metroid even was. But that&#x27;s not to say there isn&#x27;t plenty to look forward to.

Join Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan for our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom theories, thoughts on new Switch hardware, and our expert opinion on where to start with Yakuza.

                              <span>UPDATE 5pm UK: In a statement to Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson has addressed Sony&#x27;s statement: &quot;It makes zero business sense for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty from PlayStation given its market leading console position.&quot;

ORIGINAL STORY 4.45pm UK: 
Sony says it &quot;welcomes the announcement&quot; by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority that it will further investigate Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In a statement to GamesIndustry.Biz, the platform holder said that &quot;by giving Microsoft control of Activision games like Call of Duty, this deal would have major negative implications for gamers and the future of the gaming industry&quot;.

                              <span>At the conclusion of Resident Evil Village, it was teased that Ethan Winters&#x27; now teenage daughter could wield some impressive powers. What exactly these powers were was never disclosed, with Rose revealing that &quot;even Chris&quot; didn&#x27;t know the full extent of what she could do thanks to her brush with the megamycete. 


However, a new trailer for Village&#x27;s The Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC has shown off more from its new story, Shadows of Rose, including what these powers are.


Shared as part of Capcom&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show presentation, this trailer reveals that Rose is actually able to freeze her enemies. So, very name appropriate.

                              <span>343 Industries has announced that it will not be adding purchasable Spartan Points into Halo: The Master Chief Collection. 

Back in June, 343 discussed the idea of introducing Spartan Points, a premium currency to unlock items within the game.


The idea was that given there are over 1000 customisation items in MCC which were added over the years, it could be overwhelming for new players or those who only hop into the game occasionally.

                              <span>Capcom has announced a last-gen PlayStation 4 version of its upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake - but will still skip the Xbox One. 


The long-rumoured Resi 4 remake was finally unveiled back in June, and was initially announced for just PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.


Today, during a Tokyo Games Show livestream, Capcom said it had been working on securing a last-gen version of the game as well - and it had done so, but only for PS4.

                              <span>A new update for the Xbox app on PC has added official integration of website HowLongToBeat.

If you haven&#x27;t used it before, HowLongToBeat is a community run website where people can log how long it took them to beat a certain game. The times are then averaged to provide a rough estimate of the game&#x27;s expected length.

It&#x27;s by no means sound scientifically, but it&#x27;s a nifty way of ballparking how much time you might need to finish a game&#x27;s story before you commit to playing (or buying) it.

Gunsmith was first introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) as a replacement of the attachment system used in preceding titles, and it&#x27;s been used in every game since. 


The system allows players to customise their weapons in greater detail, with multiple attachments, optics and of course, skins.

                              <span>As Call of Duty fans wait for Activision to reveal the future of the franchise later today, some players have already been diving into the settings of the recent Modern Warfare 2 beta to spot new details. 


The beta, which is set to go live tomorrow evening, is available to preload now for those who have pre-ordered the game. 


The most notable finding has been the option to adjust the &quot;3rd Person Field of View,&quot; which implies that the game will feature a third-person game mode, as well as an FOV slider on console.

                              <span>Despite the flurry of Like a Dragon (or Yakuza) games that have been recently announced, none of them will be released on Switch.

Indeed, a Switch port of anything Yakuza is unlikely to happen, according to Ryu Ga Gotoku Sydido head Masayoshi Yokoyama.

Yokoyama made the statement in an interview with GameSpot yesterday and explained why the studio was reluctant to put Yakuza on Switch.

                              <span>The surprisingly brilliant PowerWash Simulator will soon arrive for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PS5.


PowerWash Simulator is a game about cleaning things - cars, helicopters, bungalows - that quickly becomes a compulsion. You complete jobs to upgrade your powerwash machine, then take on progressively bigger challenges. 


Pretty soon you&#x27;re hosing down whole skate parks, fairground rides, and a particularly grubby set of public toilets.

The creator has recently set up a website, presumably for a new game, which features nothing more than a shadowy visage with the words &quot;Who Am I?&quot; written across the image.


Clicking on this image then gives you the option to share said picture across various social media feeds, something that Geoff Keighly has done. As such, the internet now expects whatever this new project of Kojima&#x27;s is to be fully unveiled at The Game Awards this December.

                              <span>The last day of Overwatch 1 will be 2nd October, Blizzard told me during an Overwatch 2 roundtable interview last night. (Note: this is from a Pacific Time point of view. With time differences, it could be 3rd October elsewhere in the world.) Overwatch 2 will then launch 4th October and be the only Overwatch game in operation.
&quot;So roughly a day before Overwatch 2 launches, we&#x27;re going to be taking down the Overwatch 1 servers,&quot; commercial lead Jon Spector explained to me. &quot;So that means, as a practical point, that October 2nd really is the last day to go in and play Overwatch 1. And then it&#x27;s a 27-hour downtime that we&#x27;re planning in order to get the Overwatch 2 server stood up and running. 
&quot;We&#x27;ll give current Overwatch players the ability to download Overwatch 2 a little bit ahead of when we launch, if they want to pre-download. There&#x27;s also a couple of things that we&#x27;ll be asking players to do, to get ready for Overwatch 2. We&#x27;ll share a kind of launch checklist with players ahead of things so that they have a smooth experience getting in on 4th October, when we launch.

The reveal came during an unusually packed Tokyo Game Show livestream from Xbox, which also included Game Pass confirmations of the Ni No Kuni series, and an Xbox release date for Deathloop.


Odyssey is the Assassin&#x27;s Creed game set in Ancient Greece, and its deepest dive into the RPG genre. It&#x27;s a warm, enjoyable and expansive experience - and one of the highlights of the whole series.

                              <span>Nice work:
Radio relay attacks are technically complicated to execute, but conceptually easy to understand: attackers simply extend the range of your existing key using what is essentially a high-tech walkie-talkie. One thief stands near you while you’re in the grocery store, intercepting your key’s transmitted signal with a radio transceiver. Another stands near your car, with another transceiver, taking the signal from their friend and passing it on to the car. Since the car and the key can now talk, through the thieves’ range extenders, the car has no reason to suspect the key isn’t inside—and fires right up...</span>

This blog describes the two features namely minReadySeconds for StatefulSets and maxSurge for DaemonSets that SIG Apps is happy to graduate to stable in Kubernetes 1.25.
Specifying minReadySeconds slows down a rollout of a StatefulSet, when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field, by waiting for each pod for a desired time.
This time can be used for initializing the pod (e.g. warming up the cache) or as a delay before acknowledging the pod.
maxSurge allows a DaemonSet workload to run multiple instances of the same pod on a node during a rollout when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field.
This helps to minimize the downtime of the DaemonSet for consumers.
These features …</span>

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Gran Turismo movie continues to progress, with Stranger Things star David Harbour having now joined the cast.


Sony&#x27;s live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Harbour is the first member of the cast to be officially revealed (thanks The Hollywood Reporter) and he&#x27;ll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who&#x27;s helming the project.


Blomkamp will be directing from a script by Jason Hall (American Sniper) and Zach Baylin (King Richard), which dramatises an apparently true story of a teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills put him on the path toward becoming a professional racecar driver.

                              <span>&#x27;Tis the week of showcases, it seems, and following Nintendo and Sony&#x27;s efforts last night, Microsoft has taken its own turn today with another one of its predominantly indie-focused ID@Xbox digital showcase events. And if you missed its typically meandering reveals, you can check out everything that put in an appearance, considerably more succinctly, below.

Eville


Eville is a multiplayer social deduction game from developer VestGames that&#x27;s coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 11th October. It sees up to 13 players working together - or otherwise - in order to unmask Conspirators hiding in a village beset by murders. Those cast as Villagers must weed out the suspects by day, while those in the role of Conspirators can decide who should be bumped off next by night.

                              <span>Cities Skylines&#x27; 11th major expansion, Plazas and Promenades, has skipped the release date announcement pre-amble to surprise-launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC today.


Plazas and Promenades, which was announced back in August, brings a new pedestrianisation focus to developer Colossal Order&#x27;s acclaimed city builder, giving players the tools needed to add pedestrian-only streets, pedestrian zones, and zone-specific policies.


Pedestrian Streets can be placed like any other road to create green city centres largely free of vehicles and pollution. These work in tandem with new pedestrian zones which can be augmented with new policies, such as Slow Driving (reducing the speed limit for all vehicles in the area to 20km an hour), and Street Music, which boosts happiness in pedestrianised commercial zones at the expense of noise pollution.

Fortnite&#x27;s next season is set to begin this Sunday, 18th September, as its peaceful summer party gets consumed by chrome-coloured goo.

                              <span>Eight years after its initial launch, EA&#x27;s is making its enormously popular life sim The Sims 4 permanently free-to-play, beginning Tuesday, 18th October.


From that point onward, The Sims 4&#x27;s base game (which is currently priced at £17.99/£19.99 USD) will be available to download at no cost across all platforms - that is, PC, Mac, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. There&#x27;s no talk of pricing changes for the game&#x27;s extensive DLC catalogue - which totals 12 Expansion Packs, 12 Game Packs, 18 Stuff Packs, and 15 Kit Packs at present - so it appears to be business as usual on that front for now.


In a post announcing today&#x27;s news, EA said it will &quot;continue to develop and release packs, kits and Sims Delivery Express drops into the foreseeable future&quot; following The Sims 4 base game&#x27;s transition to free-to-play, with more on its future plans set to be shared in a special developer livestream airing on 18th October at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT.

According to the official Nintendo website, you&#x27;ll play as Alear &quot;who awakens a thousand years after the war [between Elyos and the Fell Dragon] with no memory of their past&quot;. 

Perhaps that&#x27;s the in-game explanation for the odd fashion choices for Alear, then.

                              <span>Ahead of Return to Monkey Island&#x27;s release next week, I sat down with series creator Ron Gilbert, co-writer Dave Grossman and art director Rex Crowle to discuss the series&#x27; surprise revival. It&#x27;s a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years (two years!) before its April Fool&#x27;s Day announcement a few months ago. 
Speaking via video call, it was clear the trio had a great passion for what they do - and also an oversized Stan S. Stanman cutout, which loomed over Gilbert&#x27;s shoulder. (This turned out to be a prop from a recent PAX trip liberated by Gilbert, thanks to the series&#x27; iconic distraction of &quot;Look! A three-headed monkey&quot;. Apparently, this move works &quot;every time&quot;.)
In addition to sharing more about Return to Monkey Island, including details of its under-wraps hint system, we spoke about the future of the series, scrapped plans to break up Guybrush and Elaine, and even ideas for Elaine Marley to lead her own game - as well as some Monty Python influences thrown in for good measure.

                              <span>Judgment, the detective spin-off to the Yakuza series, and its sequel Lost Judgment are now available on Steam.

Last year, in an article by Japanese news site Nikkan Taishu, it was revealed that Sega wished to publish the Judgment games on PC through Steam but were being blocked by actor Takuya Kimura&#x27;s management agency.

Kimura plays private investigator Takayuki Yagami, the main character of the Judgment games.

                              <span>Nintendo welcomed a select group of fans into its flagship New York store yesterday  to view its latest Direct broadcast - the first time it has done so for nearly three years.


The practice was previously commonplace pre-Covid, and frequently prompted outpourings of excitement at major Nintendo game reveals. 


Well, as we know, yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct had plenty of those - and the assembled group of fans reacted as well as you might expect to word of Pikmin 4, Fire Emblem Engage, and the name for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

                              <span>Yesterday, we were all treated to a new trailer announcing the name for Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming Legend of Zelda sequel. 
Along with finally getting its name revealed - Tears of the Kingdom - we also got some new footage. And where there is new footage, you can be sure that Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and I will not be far behind with our theories about what it all means for the next instalment in the Zelda series.
So, we have teamed up to bring you our thoughts on this new trailer below - and to discuss the little things you  may have missed on a first pass. Without further ado, let&#x27;s get stuck in.

                              <span>343 Industries, the developer behind Xbox&#x27;s blockbuster Halo series, has reportedly lost another high-profile figure.


David Berger, who served as lead developer on Infinite&#x27;s ambitious Slipspace Engine technology, will leave the studio - according to reports by Windows Central and Lords of Gaming.


News of the departure comes just days after 343&#x27;s boss Bonnie Ross announced her own exit from the company after 15 years, to attend to a family medical issue.

For non-Yakuza fans, it looks a bit confusing. Why are we so excited about an eight year old PS3/4 game being playable in English?

To explain, we need to look back on the Yakuza series as a whole.

Titled as Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, this game will follow the story of former gangster Kiryu Kazuma from the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life up until Like a Dragon 8.

A trailer was released, showing Kiryu being disciplined at a monastery, having seemingly renounced all of his former life, before it&#x27;s revealed that Kiryu is in fact still involved with the Daidoji family from Yakuza 6.

                              <span>This year has given us a fresh bounty of farming sims to harvest.

Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct alone gave us five forthcoming farming sims: Harvestella (which now has a demo), Rune Factory 3 Special, another new Rune Factory, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, and Fae Farm. Plus Japanese Switch Online subscribers are getting N64 game Harvest Moon 64.





That&#x27;s on top of recent additions like Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Island Sanctuary mode, the quirky Ooblets, and the just-released in early access Disney Dreamlight Valley.

A short trailer revealing Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga and and series poster boy Kiryu Kazuma standing in Kamurocho was shown.

This is the first official reveal of Like a Dragon 8, following the brief glimpse seen in July thanks to a video from inside Sega&#x27;s offices.

                              <span>Nintendo still intends to release Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, though is yet to decide when to do so. 


The turn-based strategy game - believed to be complete and ready to launch - was pulled from release schedules earlier this year due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


Fans had hoped to see Advance Wars 1+2 reannounced during last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, though the company made no mention of it at all.

An advert for the game now appears on the Xbox dashboard with the option to pre-order now.


However, selecting the advert takes users to a blank screen as it&#x27;s not yet available on the store itself.

AppLovin announced it was backing off in a statement last night (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), saying it had instead decided to remain on &quot;its path as the independent market leader&quot;.


Unity rejected AppLovin&#x27;s bid within a week of it being made, and stated at the time it was &quot;not in the best interests of Unity shareholders&quot;.

Kubernetes 1.25 introduces Alpha support for a new kubelet-managed pod condition
in the status field of a pod: PodHasNetwork. The kubelet, for a worker node,
will use the PodHasNetwork condition to accurately surface the initialization
state of a pod from the perspective of pod sandbox creation and network
configuration by a container runtime (typically in coordination with CNI
plugins). The kubelet starts to pull container images and start individual
containers (including init containers) after the status of the PodHasNetwork
condition is set to True. Metrics collection services that report latency of
pod initialization from a cluster infrastructural perspective (i.e. agnostic of
per container characteristics like image size or payload) can utilize the
PodHasNe…</span>

                              <span>We had an elusive tease at Evo earlier in the year, but now it is time for the real deal. Opening up Sony&#x27;s State of Play, Tekken 8 was officially announced - no I am not Tekken the piss. 


This new teaser shows Kazuya and Jin Kazama facing off against each other on a suitably atmospheric backdrop wearing inappropriate clothing. The mother in me wants to get them both a jacket. But I digress. 


You can see this new teaser for Tekken 8 below.

                              <span>Following a similar move by Activision Blizzard last year, EA has unveiled EA AntiCheat (EAAC), a new internally developed kernel-level anti-cheat system that&#x27;ll initially be rolling out with the launch of FIFA 23 on PC this autumn.


Announcing EAAC - which is officially described as a &quot;kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution&quot; - in a new blog post, the publisher explained, &quot;PC cheat developers have increasingly moved into the kernel, so we need to have kernel-mode protections to ensure fair play and tackle PC cheat developers on an even playing field.&quot;


EAAC&#x27;s arrival will coincide with the release of FIFA 23, which brings cross-play across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation to the series for the first time. &quot;In addition to EAAC protecting our PC players from cheaters,&quot; EA notes, &quot;our console players who match with PC opponents will also be protected from cheaters operating on PC platforms.&quot;

                              <span>Fallout 76&#x27;s The Pitt update, which lets players leave the boundaries of Appalachia for the first time, is out today on Xbox and PC.


Announced back in June 2021, The Pitt - which is inspired by the Fallout 3 add-on of the same name - takes players to a city built on the remains of post-nuclear Pittsburgh, which can explore by embarking on Expeditions, a brand-new feature introduced in today&#x27;s update.


Expeditions are essentially repeatable missions for up to four players that feature new NPCs and new foes to battle, with participants able to earn various in-game rewards for their endeavours. Bethesda says anyone can take part in these new activities but recommends that players be level 50+ &quot;for the best experience&quot;.

                              <span>Following a period of Xbox Insider testing announced earlier this year, Microsoft has officially launched Discord voice chat support for all Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S users.


As of today, anyone on either console will be able to connect directly to Discord Voice chats in order to talk with their friends, wherever they may be. The actual process required to do so, though, is a little convoluted, and first demands that users link their Xbox account to their Discord account - a process that&#x27;ll need to be redone if done previously, so new permissions needed for voice chat on Xbox can be confirmed.


With that step complete, you&#x27;ll next need to make sure you have the Xbox mobile app installed on your phone, and that you console is linked to the app. That done, fire up Discord on either your mobile device or desktop and join the Voice call you want to transfer to Xbox. From here, select the transfer call option, which will automatically open the Xbox mobile app.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct did not disappoint, with a brand new look at The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel, the newly-titled Tears of the Kingdom, plus surprise announcements for Pikmin 4, GoldenEye 007 and a new Fire Emblem game. 
Nintendo finally confirmed Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s name and a release date: 12th May 2023 - plus new details on what to expect from Link&#x27;s next adventure, which will apparently take him &quot;to the vast lands of Hyrule... up into the skies and [into] an expanded world that goes beyond that.&quot;
Originally confirmed to Eurogamer by Shigeru Miyamoto in 2015, Nintendo finally gave us an official first teaser for Pikmin 4. I can&#x27;t quite believe it&#x27;s still in development, but it is, and it is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2023.

As revealed in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta will be up against man-made bioweapons called Homunculi. She&#x27;ll be joined by series favourites Luka, Jeanne, and new ally Viola.


Perhaps the biggest addition (literally) to combat this time are the infernal demons.

                              <span>Wube Software&#x27;s much-loved construction and management sim Factorio will be making its way to Switch on 28th October.


Factorio, which has garnered a seemingly endless procession of rave reviews since entering Steam early access all the way back in 2016 (it got its full release in 2020), casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation.


Ultimately, the goal is to build a rocket ship and escape the planet you&#x27;ve crash-landed on - a process that begins by farming natural resources to create basic machines which, in turn, open up more and more construction possibilities the further you travel along the tech tree. Eventually, with the planet&#x27;s hostile local wildlife dead and conveyor belts stretching as far as the eye can see, freedom should, hopefully, be yours.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct revealed a lot of surprises - including, of course, the long overdue re-reveal of Pikmin 4 seven whole years after Miyamoto first told us about it - but one of the biggest shocks didn&#x27;t even get a place in the western broadcast. It turns out that Clap Hanz just quietly released its latest golf game on the eShop, rebranded as Easy Come, Easy Golf. 


It&#x27;s effectively a re-release of Clap Hanz Golf, which we first saw on Apple Arcade last April, and which was the developer&#x27;s first non-PlayStation foray. On PlayStation, Clap Hanz was behind the brilliant Everybody&#x27;s Golf series, games we&#x27;ve been championing on Eurogamer for some time. Clap Hanz Golf was essentially more Everybody&#x27;s Golf on a different platform - so to see it reborn on the Switch where it can be played with traditional controls is a very welcome thing indeed. 


You can find Easy Come Easy Golf on the Switch right now, where it currently costs £17.59.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming fantasy farming game Harvestella is getting a Switch eShop demo today, ahead of its 4th November release.


Harvestella - a sort of blend of Final Fantasy, Harvest Moon, and Rune Factory - casts players as an amnesiac who wakes up in a world where the seasons are governed by four giant crystals known as Seaslight. Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.


What follows is a familiar blend of farming, socialising, and adventuring that sees players growing crops to raise the money needed to buy new farming and adventuring equipment - the latter helping players gradually push deeper into Harvestella&#x27;s dungeon-like regions where they&#x27;ll encounter enemies and bosses, and gather resources required elsewhere.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village - the most recent entry in Capcom&#x27;s acclaimed survival horror series - will be coming to Switch, albeit in cloud streaming form, on 28th October, with a bunch of other Resident Evil games following closely behind.


Village, of course, is the direct sequel to 2017&#x27;s Resident Evil 7 and follows that game&#x27;s protagonist, Ethan Winters, as he travels to a mysterious village filled with mutant creatures - and some exceptionally tall ladies - in order to find his kidnapped daughter.


There&#x27;s a demo version out today on Switch&#x27;s eShop, and Capcom says it&#x27;ll also be releasing Village&#x27;s previously announced Winters&#x27; Expansion - promising the likes of new story content and a new third-person mode - for Switch on 2nd December.

                              <span>Announced during the latest Nintendo Direct, Tunic is coming to the Nintendo Switch on September 27th, the same day the little Zelda-inspired fox hits PS4 and PS5.
Tunic was previously only available on Xbox consoles, PC and Mac, and was also a day one Xbox Game Pass title.
If you&#x27;re not familiar with Tunic, it&#x27;s an indie game primarily developed by just one person, Andrew Shouldice, who was inspired by early Zelda games and their detailed manuals, particularly Zelda II - but don&#x27;t let that put you off.

                              <span>Octopath Traveler 2 was announced during this afternoon&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, and will launch on Switch 24th February 2023. The Square Enix Japan OT2 trailer also notes Steam, PS4 and PS5 releases for the game (thanks, commenter TinyKaiju! Great name, too).
The sequel takes place in a new era and involves eight new characters whose adventures you&#x27;ll get to individually play. The era appears to be more modern and reminds me of a kind of 18th/19th Century. There are huge, ocean-going ships but also trains of a kind, probably steam. And it looks as deliciously dinky and delicate as Octopath Traveler did before it.
Characters will also apparently now have different path actions at day and night, and there&#x27;s specific mention of their stories intertwining in this game.

Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto first confirmed Pikmin 4 to me as part of an interview with Eurogamer back in 2015. It&#x27;s fair to say we&#x27;ve been waiting on this one for a while.


In 2017, I asked Miyamoto about the project again - and heard from the Nintendo legend that it was still progressing. I never gave up hope.

This Switch port, annouced as part of today&#x27;s Direct, will offer local wireless play via a Friends Pass which lends this version of It Takes Two its own edge.


In It Takes Two, players take on the role of unhappily married couple Cody and May. A turn of events leaves the couple trapped inside the bodies of two dolls that were made by their daughter, Rose. The twosome must work together to complete multiple tests presented to them by It Takes Two&#x27;s relationship therapist, Dr. Hakim... The Book of Love.

An early sample of the device, apparently left behind by accident, was recently discovered by hotel worker Ramiro Cardenas - after he responded to complaints of a pile of rubbish left in a bag in a corridor.


Cardenas, a VR fan, quickly realised what the device actually was - and promptly posted a series of photos and videos on the internet.

Future updates planned for the game have been scrapped, and its servers will go dark on 28th February next year. After that, you will no longer be able to log in and play.


Babylon&#x27;s Fall only launched in March this year, but has struggled to attract players from the get-go. Square Enix confirmed it was pulling the plug this morning, and said it would run a final season of content from November until the game goes dark.
