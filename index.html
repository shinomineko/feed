While issuing a kubectl delete command and hoping for the best might work for day-to-day operations, understanding how Kubernetes delete commands operate will help you understand why some objects linger after deletion.
In this post, I’ll look at:
What properties of a resource govern deletion
How finalizers and owner references impact object deletion

The gist of Knockout City is that, in time-honoured dodgeball style, two teams of players (either 3v3 or 4v4) battle it out for supremacy by lobbing balls at each other.

It wasn't quite the infamous stim glitch, but the end result was similar, as this time players found an exploit that allowed them to create unbreakable gas masks. Thankfully, this particular method has now been patched out by Raven. 
In your average game of Warzone, masks are supposed to degrade when you sit outside the ring, eventually breaking so that you start taking damage from the gas (and die). Some players figured out a way to glitch…</span>

Fortnite fans do not typically get to see the battle royale's eye-catching characters until they're added to the game's files - and even then, some are encrypted so they're a complete surprise until they go on sale. 
However, a new player survey has spilled onto the internet via LeakySussed - and among questions about the game itself there are dozens of unrevealed characters for fans to offer feedback on.

It was a monumental task.

                      <span>Destiny 2's new transmog system to change the appearance of items has come under further fire from fans, following its general release. 
In the run up to its long-awaited launch, players despaired at the announcement of its grind-heavy mechanics. Now it's actually out in the wild, the criticism has continued. 
Chief among the complaints is the fact that Synthstrand, the base tier of three transmog currencies, appears to be time-gated.

The company was set to charge $35 per character for an optional cloning service, which would let players keep playing the original World of Warcraft Classic content and The Burning Crusade content with the same character.
The $35 (around £25) price was roundly criticised by the World of Warcraft community as being too expensive - and Blizzard came under fire accordingly.

                      <span>Continuing its welcome push for accessibility and inclusivity on Xbox, Microsoft has introduced a number of new features to its Xbox Party Chat system.

Announced via the PlayStation blog, the two new colours are themed around space and are officially called "midnight black and cosmic red". The black apparently comes in "two subtly different shades of black with light grey detailing", and y…</span>

                      <span>Since its announcement back at BlizzCon 2019, Overwatch 2's pre-release marketing has predominantly focussed on its new bits - which is to say its story campaign and co-op modes. PvP's still a major part of the package, of course, and Blizzard will finally be giving Overwatch 2's competitive multiplayer an airing more of an airing next week.
That's according to Overwatch game director Aaron Keller, making his Developer Update video debut following Jeff Kaplan's departure from Blizzard last month.

Bandai Namco has announced the demo will first land on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on 21st May, with PlayStation 4 and PS5 following on 28th May. There's no news on whether the demo is coming to PC, so we'll have to wait and see if it comes to the platform.

                      <span>Microsoft has released a new dynamic theme for Xbox Series X/S which brings to life the retro, Matrix-inspired aesthetic of the OG Xbox. 
The animated background, named "The Original", is more akin to the loading animation you got when first turning on that chunky console rather than its actual dashboard, but the look will likely still feel familiar. 
Here's The Verge's Tom Warren with a preview - though it should now be rolling out to all Xbox Series X/S owners:

Or, in normal speak, Ubisoft wanted its profits to grow by making even more money from other things.
On Twitter, Ubisoft's Sean Lama clarified this did not mean free-to-play games would replace AAA games. Instead, it meant Ubisoft now saw free-to-play as "an additional way to experience some of these…</span>

                      <span>Ever since the new generation of consoles released at the end of last year, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles have suffered from stock shortages - and as a result of that, increased levels of scalping. The problem grew so severe that even British politicans began to pay attention. And with console shortages set to continue for the foreseeable future, it seems Microsoft is trialling a new way for customers to acquire a console - without everything being ruined by scalper bots.

Reports of Destiny 2 crossplay being possible emerged last night, and were picked up by Destiny community manager Cozmo. 
Describing it as an unintended "sneak peek", Bungie said that crossplay was officially still in development, and would be disabled again in the coming days.

Zombies Ate My Neighbors, which originally launched on SNES and Sega Mega Drive back in 1993, follows the adventures of Zeke and Julie (who can be played solo or co-operatively) as they attempt to save their neighbours from a host of B-movie monsters - zombies, werewolves, vampires, giant ants, aliens, and so on - on a journey that stretches from suburb…</span>

                      <span>HTC has unveiled the latest addition to its PC VR headset line-up in the form of the Vive Pro 2, which arrives on 4th June with pre-orders open now.
As its name implies, HTC's Vive Pro 2 is the direct successor to the high-end PC VR headset it released in 2018. It'll up the ante with a 5K resolution display (2448x2448 pixels per eye), a 120-degree field of view, and a 120Hz panel. By way of contrast, the original Vive Pro featured a 2880x1600 resolution, a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate.

                      <span>EA Play Live, the publisher's big annual announcement show, will be held this year on 22nd July. 
That's a month later than 2021's digital-only E3 event, which is dated for 12th to 15th June. 
EA has not been a major part of E3 for years, instead opting to hold its own EA Play events elsewhere. E3 is traditionally held at the Los Angeles Convention Centre, while in recent years EA has housed its own show at the same time a few miles away up in Hollywood.

TorrentFreak reports GitHub restored a fork of the fan-made re3 project after its creator filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown counter-claim.
As Eurogamer reported in February, the Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City reverse-engineering fan project known as re3 was hit by a DMCA filed by Rockstar parent company Take-Two that claimed copyright infringement.

                      <span>Fortnite looks ready to launch its sandbox survival mode, Daybreak, according to files added in today's new 16.40 patch. 
We've seen glimpses of Daybreak before, in leaked files from previous patches and also, intriguingly, via internal documentation released as part of the ongoing Apple v Epic trial, dated from last year. This suggested it has been in the works for quite some time, and was set to arrive a lot sooner.

                      <span>Respawn recently reassured players that it was exploring "every avenue" to take down Apex Legends cheaters - legal action being one of them - and it seems one high-profile cheater is already facing something worse than the ban hammer. Prolific cheater Tufi, who some in the Apex Legends community have described as a "God" and "unbannable" cheater, is apparently facing some form of legal action from Respawn - although details remain light on exactly how far this has progressed.

Last night, in the ongoing Apple v Epic trial, Peely came under scrutiny for being a naked piece of fruit with arms and legs.
In remarks transcribed from the courtroom by Verge reporter Adi Robertson, a lawyer for Apple brought up Peely in court and made a deal of showing the character wearing clothes (his Chapter 2 Season 2 Bond-esque Agent Peely tuxedo).

The official Call of Duty Twitter account released a short clip showing Rambo preparing to unleash a fire arrow from his trademark bow at an unfortunate victim, alongside the tagline: "Become war."
Rambo arrives on 20th May as part of the mid-season update for Season 3 - no doubt as a costly soldier skin.

Dutch director Richard Raaphorst said the Sturm boss found in the recently-released Resident Evil Village is a "one-to-one" copy of a monster he created for his 2013 found footage horror film Frankenstein's Army.
Capcom failed to comment by press time.

ValheimRAFT is a mod by Sarcen that allows players to construct their own ships rather than simply use the pre-made ones available in vanilla Valheim. (If the name didn't give it away, it's inspired by the game Raft, a survival game in which you construct a boat from bits of debris.) I had a quick tinker with it and made a basic ghost…</span>

                      <span>The constrained supply of the PlayStation 5 will continue into 2022, Sony has warned.
The company's CFO, Hiroki Totoki, said Sony will struggle to meet demand even with a supply boost, Bloomberg reported (paywall).
As most know, the PS5 is incredibly hard to buy at the moment, with stock snapped up as soon as it goes on sale. The console has also been the focus of scalpers, who sell on for an inflated price. Retailers have struggled to prevent new consoles from getting into the hands of scalper groups, some…</span>

According to AreaJugones - a Spanish-language site that has previously correctly leaked a PlayStation Plus freebie lineup ahead of confirmation from PlayStation - the new colour schemes deviate from the current white and black scheme to include shades of red and grey. 
Without photographic evidence, it's not possible to know precisely how the colours will be used, or what parts of the controller will be more colourful…</span>

                      <span>Respawn has seemingly nerfed Wattson's electrified fence in Apex Legends.
As spotted and shared by Twitterer LilakeyLK, it looks as though the latest season has not only introduced a new Legend and competitive mode Arenas, but it's also made a tweak to one of Wattson's key defences... with an emphasis on "fence".
Previously, running into Wattson's fence would slow down an opposing player, but now it looks as though the slowdown and corresponding stun has been removed, essentially making the fence useless (t…</span>

Activision even created a website for a fictional air conditioning repair company called Nakatomi Duct Cleaning, offering its services in Verdansk.
The website says "A NAKATOMI CORP DIVISION MASTERING A/C DUCT CLEANING SINCE 1988", but the current Warzone map is set in 1984. Nah... I'm applying too much logic…</span>

Local press reported the strange image on Monday, 3rd May after it popped up overnight - and seemingly had no idea what it was about or who made it.
Its true nature was revealed when Resident Evil Village came out on Friday - it was a Capcom PR stunt. And a pretty cool one, I'll admit.

                      <span>A modder has released their final Nier: Automata HD texture pack after four years of development.
GPUnity's texture pack mod began life soon after Nier: Automata launched on PC in March 2017. They've continued to work on the mod since then, and now, four years later, released the final version.
Nier: Automata's PC version is infamous for a raft of technical issues that were fixed by modders, including a constant stutter tick due to the game running at around 59 frames per second (this is something explored …</span>

                      <span>This week, Sega announced Lost Judgment for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One - but there was no word of a PC version.
It seemed an odd omission - Tojo Dojo noticed the Yakuza spin-off sequel was briefly listed as coming to PC on the official countdown website that was home to the Lost Judgment announcement. Even after mention of PC was removed from the website, fans spotted mention of the Steam logo in the Lost Judgment website source code.
Unfortunately, it appears Lost Judgm…</span>

                      <span>Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance's re-release on Nintendo Switch was delayed at the last minute.
The re-release of the much-loved 20 year-old action RPG went ahead as planned yesterday on Xbox One, where it costs a pricey £29.99, and PlayStation 4, where for some reason it costs a fiver cheaper at £24.99.
But even though the official Black Isle Studios Twitter page said yesterday that the Switch version would arrive in a couple of hours, the game failed to materialise on the Nintendo eShop.

                      <span>With Titanfall 2 enjoying an Apex Legends-powered resurgence, so is its superb Gauntlet.
Respawn's wall-hopping assault course tasks players with completing one lap as quickly as possible - and nearly five years after Titanfall 2 came out, speedrunners are breaking world records again.
In October 2019, speedrunner Cash Mayo set an incredible time of 11.7 seconds, shaving a fraction off Mayo's previous world record of 11.9 seconds:

"The Yakuza series has been transformed into a turn-based RPG. On the other hand, over the years, Ryu ga Gotoku Studio has accumulated resources and know-how of making flashy and exhilarating action games that are effortless to enjoy. We decided that we should let our signature action gameplay live on through Lost Judgment."

                      <span>Call of Duty: Warzone developer Raven has said it is close to a "balance homeostasis", where most weapon options are "at the very least viable" - leaving it to focus on raising the skill ceiling of the game.
The developer shared its balance change philosophy as part of the patch notes for a Warzone update that went live this week.
Raven spoke openly about the difficulty it faces making sweeping changes to the Warzone meta, as popular guns are inevitably affected.

One local told the Chunichi Shimbun newspaper that while the statue may be effective in the long run, the money could have been used for &#8220;urgent support,&#8221; such as for medical staff and long-term care facilities.
But a spokesperson for the town told Fuji News Network that the statue would be a tourist attraction and part of a long term strategy to help promote Noto&#8217;s famous flying squid.

The new line of attacks exploits the micro-op cache: an on-chip structure that speeds up computing by storing simple commands and allowing the processor to fetch them quickly and early in the speculative execution process, as the team explains in a writeup…</span>

Kubernetes 1.21 marks the graduation of the metrics stability framework and along with it, the first officially supported stable metrics. Not only do stable metrics come with supportability guarantees, the metrics stability framework brings escape hatches that you can use if you encounter problematic metrics.

Once you have containerized a non-parallel Job,
it is quite easy to get it up and running on Kubernetes without modifications to
the binary. In most cases, when running parallel distributed Jobs, you had
to set a separate system to partition the work among the workers. For
example, you could set up a task queue to assign one work item to each
Pod or multiple items
to each Pod until the queue is emptied.

The CSI Volume Health Monitoring feature, originally introduced in 1.19 has undergone a large update for the 1.21 release.
Why add Volume Health Monitoring to Kubernetes?
Without Volume Health Monitoring, Kubernetes has no knowledge of the state of the underlying volumes of a storage system after a PVC is provisioned and used by a Pod. Many things could happen to the underlying storage system after a volume is provisioned in Kubernetes. For example, the volume could be deleted by …</span>
