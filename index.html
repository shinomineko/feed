The Security Profiles Operator (SPO)
is an out-of-tree Kubernetes enhancement to make the management of
seccomp,
SELinux and
AppArmor profiles easier and more
convenient. We&#x27;re happy to announce that we recently released
v0.4.0
of the operator, which contains a ton of new features, fixes and usability
improvements.
What&#x27;s new
It has been a while since the last
v0.3.0
release of the operator. We added new features, fine-tuned existing ones and
reworked our documentation in 290 commits over the past half year.
One of the highlights is that we&#x27;re now able to record seccomp and SELinux
profiles using the operators log enricher.
This allows us to reduce the dependencies required for profile recording to have

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been enjoying your time sleuthing around the sunny, Mediterranean-inspired climes of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, you might be interested to know that developer Frogwares has just released a brand-new case to crack in the form of its Beyond a Joke DLC.
Beyond a Joke, which is out now on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5, serves up a new quest - the first of &quot;three major bonus story content additions&quot;, as Frogwares puts it - in which young Sherlock Holmes and his chiselled jawline go on the hunt for an &quot;unstoppable&quot; thief targeting the island of Cordona&#x27;s ultra-rich &quot;with brazen gusto and open mockery&quot;.

                    <span>Actor Ernie Hudson, perhaps better known as Ghostbusters&#x27; Winston Zeddemore, has claimed a new video game based on the legendary movie series is &quot;definitely happening&quot;.
This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve heard word of a new Ghostbusters game, of course; back in October, Raphael Saadiq, the co-founder of Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunter Grounds developer Illfonic, let slip that the studio was currently working on the title. Unsurprisingly though, given that the game is still yet to be officially announced, Saadiq hasn&#x27;t offered any update since, leaving movie fans uncertain of the project&#x27;s status.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot going on in the world of Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock today; not only has the studio announced it&#x27;s been acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, it&#x27;s also just released the first big post-launch content update for its well-received co-op zombie shooter. The latter brings with it a range of tweaks and additions, the most notable of which is a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression.
First the acquisition news; as of today, following Tencent&#x27;s purchase of Turtle Rock&#x27;s parent company Slamfire, the studio is now wholly owned by the Chinese conglomerate. According to the announcement, Turtle Rock will continue to operate independently at its Lake Forest, California, offices, with co-founders Phil Robb and Chris Ashton remaining at the helm.

                    <span>This seems big:
The UK government has officially included decapod crustaceans–including crabs, lobsters, and crayfish–and cephalopod mollusks–including octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish–in its Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill. This means they are now recognized as “sentient beings” in the UK.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>Author: Matthew Cary (Google)
Kubernetes v1.23 introduced a new, alpha-level policy for
StatefulSets that controls the lifetime of
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) generated from the
StatefulSet spec template for cases when they should be deleted automatically when the StatefulSet
is deleted or pods in the StatefulSet are scaled down.
What problem does this solve?
A StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the
Kubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior
before Kubernetes v1.23 was that the control plane never cleaned up the PVCs created for
StatefulSets - this was left up to the cluster administrator, or to some add-on automation that
you’d have to find, check suitability, and deploy. The commo…</span>

                    <span>Minecraft, you probably don&#x27;t need telling, is popular; it&#x27;s sold over 238M copies since its launch in 2009 making it the best-selling game of all time, it claims over 140M monthly active users, and was enticing enough for Microsoft to spend an eye-watering $2.5 billion USD acquiring its developer Mojang back in 2014. And now here&#x27;s another massive figure for the record books: it&#x27;s officially the first game to surpass one trillion views on YouTube.
To celebrate the immense milestone, YouTube has launched a new website highlighting the creators and videos that helped Minecraft reach 1,000,000,000,000 views over the last decade - a figure that would, as YouTube points out to put it into some kind of perspective, amount to over 30,000 years if each view equated to just one second of time.

Ubisoft first revealed it would be revisiting the Settlers&#x27; much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula in a new series instalment back in 2018. At the time, it told fans to expect the title in autumn the following year but, as that window grew near, the publisher announced a delay, pushing the game&#x27;s release into 2020.

                    <span>The Queen and the Sea, the third paid expansion for developer Motion Twin&#x27;s majestic rogue-like action-platformer Dead Cells, will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 6th January next year, and there&#x27;s a first trailer to celebrate the news.
The Queen and the Sea, which follows previous paid expansions The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls, brings a touch of the nautical to Dead Cells&#x27; acclaimed action, introducing new enemies, bosses, weapons, and two brand-new biomes - Infested Shipwreck and the Lighthouse - that&#x27;ll run parallel to the existing High Peak Castle and Throne Room late-game stages.

                    <span>Red Candle Games, the developer behind critically acclaimed horror outings Detention and Devotion, has - following a bit of an animated tease earlier this year - formally announced its latest title, an action-platformer loosely inspired by From Software&#x27;s superb Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice that&#x27;s currently going by the name of Nine Sols.
Details are extremely limited right now, but Red Candle describes Nine Sols (a working title at present) as a &quot;lore rich hand-drawn 2D platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat&quot;. The developer has also shared a wonderfully evocative bit of promo art that - while a significant aesthetic departure from its previous games - does suggest, with its mangled limbs and pools of blood, that we&#x27;re not exactly in family friendly territory here.

                    <span>Tis the season of festive sales in video game land, and the Epic Games Store has now thrown open its shutters and bellowed news of its own discount offerings into the cold winter night, which includes the return of its daily &quot;mystery gift&quot; free games, starting with Shenmue 3.
Shenmue 3 is, of course, the long, long, long-awaited third instalment in developer Yu Suzuki&#x27;s classic action-adventure series, which finally arrived in 2019 following a gap of 18 years between it and its predecessor. Picking up where Shenmue 2 left off, part 3 sees protagonist Ryo Hazuki resume his quest for vengeance after the murder of his father in the original, delivering a new chapter that Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robison called both &quot;archaic and arcane&quot; and &quot;a worthy successor to what many consider an all-time great&quot; in his review.

PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) are
associated with Reclaim Policy.
The Reclaim Policy is used to determine the actions that need to be taken by the storage
backend on deletion of the PV.
Where the reclaim policy is Delete, the expectation is that the storage backend
releases the storage resource that was allocated for the PV. In essence, the reclaim
policy needs to honored on PV deletion.
With the recent Kubernetes v1.23 release, an alpha feature lets you configure your
cluster to behave that way and honor the configured reclaim policy.

                    <span>343 Industries has released a new Halo Infinite hotfix, aiming to tackle Quick Resume issues reported by Xbox Series X/S players last week.
The incident saw players reporting that earned cosmetics were failing to show up in multiplayer inventories - which in turn saw 343 warning against using Xbox&#x27;s Quick Resume feature during Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign, with developer explaining the issue was caused by Quick Resume failing to get sessions back online.

                    <span>Inscryption, the acclaimed deck-building horror game from Pony Island and The Hex developer Daniel Mullins, is getting a free new mini-expansion that will turn its devilishly enjoyable opening act into an endless, rogue-like experience.
As with Mullins&#x27; previous creations, Inscryption - a dizzyingly strange blend of deck-building rogue-like, escape-room puzzler, and psychological horror - loves to surprise, which inevitably means some deviation away from its opening portion, a engaging combination of sharply designed card battling and Slay-the-Spire-style map progression.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re in the market for a thoroughly delightful distraction to help occupy those cold winter nights over the festive period (and who wouldn&#x27;t be?), you might like to point your face in the direction of Ubisoft Connect, where the excellent Rayman Oranges is currently free on PC.
It&#x27;s yet another offering in Ubisoft&#x27;s 35th anniversary celebrations, which have previously seen the publisher tucking into its pockets of yore and slinging the likes of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed Chronicles trilogy, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, and Anno 1404: History Edition at PC players.

                    <span>As part of its fascinating Power On documentary series released to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Xbox, Microsoft has discussed the time it rejected Rockstar&#x27;s pitch to put Grand Theft Auto 3 on the original Xbox back in 2001 - a decision that would ultimately lead to the multi-million-selling phenomenon being snapped up by Sony as a timed exclusive.
The story, which follows similarly candid recollections from Microsoft in Power On - including the admission its closure of Fable developer Lionhead Studios was one of the company&#x27;s &quot;biggest missteps&quot; - comes in the third episode. Here, various members of the original Xbox team discuss Microsoft&#x27;s preparations for the console&#x27;s launch, which saw the group going on a &quot;barnstorming tour&quot; across America, Europe, and Japan to build excitement and convince developers its machine could be a success.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re curious about PlayStation Plus but haven&#x27;t yet become a member - or have no intention of ever becoming a member, but have a sudden urge to play some online multiplayer games all the same - Sony is giving players two days to trial the subscription service this weekend.
PlayStation Plus, should you be unfamiliar, is required to play the vast majority of PlayStation 4 and PS5 multiplayer games online (although free-to-play titles such as Fortnite are excluded), and, as an extra incentive to subscribe, offers a monthly selection of games to add to your library for the duration of a membership at no extra cost.

                    <span>If been wondering where Nightdive Studios&#x27; long-in-the-works System Shock remake has got to - given that it&#x27;s previously announced &quot;late summer&quot; 2021 release window has very much been and gone - the developer says the project is now due to arrive some time next year. It&#x27;ll be published by Koch Media&#x27;s Prime Matter division and there are a selection of new screenshots to tide people over until more solid release date news comes their way.
It has, of course, been a long and eventful road for the System Shock remake, which was originally intended to be a remaster of Looking Glass Technologies&#x27; cult-classic 1994 sci-fi horror before ballooning in scope. By the time its Kickstarter commenced in July 2016, Nightdive was calling it a &quot;reboot&quot; and, after a rocky period of development, the studio announced it was putting the project on hiatus after letting &quot;things get out of control&quot;.

                    <span>Details about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s next expansion, widely thought to be called Dawn of Ragnarok, have leaked via a Chinese web site.
Ubisoft announced Valhalla would be receiving a second year of updates back in June, confirming several new expansions were on the way, starting in 2022. The publisher is yet to share specifics but clues spotted in Valhalla&#x27;s Trophy list have suggested the first will be titled Dawn of Ragnarök.

                    <span>Persona 3 Portable may be getting a &quot;multiplatform&quot; remaster.
As spotted by Nintendo Enthusiast, the same leaker that correctly teased that a remaster of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax was on the way has also revealed that a &quot;multiplatform&quot; remaster of Persona 3 Portable is possibly in development.

Though currently running as a &quot;beta&quot; site - which means we&#x27;re to expect &quot;a few hiccups&quot; - the Pokémon Center UK site caters directly to fans in the UK, offering a flat shipping fee of £5 per order.

                    <span>While we already knew that Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is coming to PC via Epic Games Store next week, 16th December, we now have a price: £65 in the UK, $70 in the US, and €80 in Europe.
Yes, that version includes both the photo mode and the Intergrade expansion that&#x27;s currently only available on PlayStation 5 (thanks, PC Gamer), but it&#x27;s the &quot;standard&quot; edition of a game - that is, a base version without a season pass, cosmetic items, or DLC etc. - and one of the first PC games to be sold at &quot;next-gen&quot; console prices.

The Kubernetes in-tree storage plugin to Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration infrastructure has already been beta since v1.17. CSI migration was introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.14.
Since then, SIG Storage and other Kubernetes special interest groups are working to ensure feature stability and compatibility in preparation for GA.
This article is intended to give a status update to the feature as well as changes between Kubernetes 1.17 and 1.23. In addition, I will also cover the future roadmap for the CSI migration feature GA for each storage plugin.
Quick recap: What is CSI Migration, and why migrate?
The Container Storage Interface (CSI) was designed to help Kubernetes replace its existing, in-tree storage driver mechanisms - especially vendor spe…</span>

                    <span>Following its blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss it debut during this year&#x27;s Game Awards, developer Rebellion has officially revealed Sniper Elite 5, which will be making its way to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC some time next year.
As you&#x27;d expect, Sniper Elite 5 will deliver more of the series&#x27; &quot;unparalleled tactical sniping&quot;, as Rebellion puts it, alongside an enhanced version of the iconic kill cam, said to be &quot;more realistic and grisly than ever&quot;. All that comes with a shift in location, with Sniper Elite 5&#x27;s WW2 yarn taking the series away from Italy circa 1943, as seen in the previous game, to the France of 1944.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard has emailed staff arguing that &quot;active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees&quot; is better than unionisation as ongoing strike action heads into its fifth day.
Last month, Activision Blizzard was the focus of a damning Wall Street Journal report detailing further alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - further shining an unflattering spotlight on an organisation already facing widespread condemnation following the launch of a California state lawsuit in July calling it a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.

                    <span>Frontier Developments has offered Elite Dangerous players with access to the game&#x27;s troubled Odyssey expansion a bit of an early Christmas present, finally introducing a new ground vehicle option - the two-seater Scorpion SRV - for the first time in six years.
Elite Dangerous&#x27; first SRV (that&#x27;s Surface Recon Vehicle, in case you were wondering) arrived as part of the game&#x27;s Horizons expansion back in 2015. Horizons added the ability to land on planets, and that first SRV, the single-seater Scarab - released long before the Odyssey expansion introduced on-foot traversal - was an integral part of the puzzle, giving players the ability to travel outside their ships.

The trailer ends with the game&#x27;s &quot;2022&quot; release window - which hasn&#x27;t changed. This means it is still slated to turn up in the same year as Gotham Knights, the next game from Arkham Oranges studio Warner Bros. Montreal.

It&#x27;s certainly welcome news if not particularly surprising; after all, developer Remedy has spent the last few years doing its best to bring Alan Wake back into the public conscience - first in a fairly substantial cameo in the studio&#x27;s acclaimed supernatural shooter Control, and then in a refreshed remaster for the 2010 original earlier this year.

                    <span>Capcom&#x27;s brilliant Monster Hunter Rise is, very excitingly given how good the base game is, set to get a &quot;massive&quot; paid expansion next summer in the form of Sunbreak, and we&#x27;ve now been given a fresh look at its action - and new monster Lunagaron - in a new teaser trailer.
We initially got a taste of Sunbreak&#x27;s moody new climes in September, when Capcom brought first news of the expansion. However, as part of this year&#x27;s Game Awards, the publisher has traded pre-rendered cinematics for what appears to be in-engine footage. Granted, we&#x27;re still talking cut-scenes here, but it&#x27;s nice to get a more tangible look at the game as its release drawers slowly nearer.

                    <span>The cloud may seem a nebulous concept, but it’s a place where a huge and increasing amount of IT takes place. And it has been a boon for startups.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>A January 2021 FBI document outlines what types of data and metadata can be lawfully obtained by the FBI from messaging apps. Rolling Stone broke the story and it’s been written about elsewhere.
I don’t see a lot of surprises in the document. Lots of apps leak all sorts of metadata: iMessage and WhatsApp seem to be the worst. Signal protects the most metadata. End-to-end encrypted message content can be available if the user uploads it to an unencrypted backup server.</span>

With the release of Kubernetes v1.23, Pod Security admission has now entered beta. Pod Security is a built-in admission controller that evaluates pod specifications against a predefined set of Pod Security Standards and determines whether to admit or deny the pod from running.
Pod Security is the successor to PodSecurityPolicy which was deprecated in the v1.21 release, and will be removed in Kubernetes v1.25. In this article, we cover the key concepts of Pod Security along with how to use it. We hope that cluster administrators and developers alike will use this new mechanism to enforce secure defaults for their workloads.

                    <span>Blasphemous, developer The Game Kitchen&#x27;s superb gothic action-platformer, has reached the end of its current adventure, wrapping things up with a final free expansion, Wounds of Eventide, that&#x27;s available now on all platforms.
Blasphemous, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, released to well-deserved acclaim back in 2019, sending players on a decidedly dark quest - a punishing, but deeply rewarding blend of 2D Souls-like and Metroidvania - that told the story of The Penitent One, a pointy hatted fellow with a barbed-wire sword, forced to venture across the accursed kingdom of Cvstodia.

                    <span>Gears of War&#x27;s Marcus Fenix and Kait Diaz are the latest characters to be uprooted from their usual homes and shoved into the metaversal nightmare that is Fortnite, with both arriving in the free-to-play battle royale game later today.
It&#x27;s not entirely clear what the occasion is - although a quick Google tells me Gears of War is currently celebrating its 15 year, one month, and two day anniversary, so perhaps that&#x27;s a thing - but Fenix and Diaz will both be available as paid skins in the Fortnite store from 7pm ET this evening, which equates to 12am, 10th December in the UK.

                    <span>Thursday is here, meaning a fresh batch of free games to download and keep courtesy of the Epic Games Store, which this week look an awful lot like Prison Architect and Godfall: Challenger Edition. And if that&#x27;s somehow not enough to be getting on with, leaks are suggesting Epic will have plenty more freebies to give away over the festive period.
First up though, this week&#x27;s offerings, beginning with developer Counterplay Games&#x27; Godfall: Challenger Edition. If that name sounds familiar, it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s the same title currently being given away, somewhat controversially, as part of PlayStation Plus.

After years of hype and flashy trailers, Cyberpunk 2077 arrived in a broken and buggy state on consoles, particularly on last-gen machines. The game was temporarily withdrawn from sale on PlayStation and, a year on, its next-gen update is still to materialise.

The key changes include improvements to hit registration consistency, the addition of a toggle to disable cross-play for Xbox Series X/S players, and fixing a rare bug where a player would be invisible to other players (which was quite handy if you wanted to earn the melee achievement).

The Nintendo that Uemura joined in the 70s was still centred around hanafuda cards, and it was his engineering prowess that helped it make new inroads into the toy industry. Uemura worked alongside Gunpei Yokoi and Genyo Takeda on their early light gun games, before heading up Nintendo&#x27;s first foray into home consoles with the Color-TV series that started in 1977.

The campaign, which released yesterday, is set on a large slice of a Halo ring. Dotted around the ring are armour lockers that, once found, unlock cosmetics for use in the multiplayer.

&quot;When will Kubernetes have IPv6?&quot; This question has been asked with increasing frequency ever since alpha support for IPv6 was first added in k8s v1.9. While Kubernetes has supported IPv6-only clusters since v1.18, migration from IPv4 to IPv6 was not yet possible at that point. At long last, dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 networking has reached general availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.23.
What does dual-stack networking mean for you? Let’s take a look…
Service API updates
Services were single-stack before 1.20, so using both IP families meant creating one Service per IP family. The user experience was simplified in 1.20, when Services were re-implemented to allow both IP families, meaning a single Service can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 workloads. Dual-stack load…</span>

                    <span>Following a judge&#x27;s ruling that Apple must allow developers the option of linking to external payment systems in their iOS apps as part of its lawsuit with Epic Games, an appeals court has permitted Apple to delay making the change until it&#x27;s fully able to hear the case.
Back in September - following a lengthy court battle arising from Apple&#x27;s decision to remove Fortnite from its App Store after Epic wilfully broke App Store guidelines by deliberately circumventing iOS&#x27; in-app payment mechanisms - California&#x27;s Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruled against all but one of Epic&#x27;s legal challenges.

                    <span>Kratos is making the leap from PlayStation to PC early next year as 2018&#x27;s acclaimed God of War heads to the platform - and in anticipation of its arrival, Sony has released a new trailer showing the PC version in action, alongside details of the enhancements it&#x27;ll bring.
God of War 2018, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, reunites with Kratos some time after his reckoning with the gods of Olympus. It&#x27;s all change as the game begins; not only has our protagonist gained a big bushy beard and slightly mellower demeanour in the interim (not to mention, got himself a son), he&#x27;s swapped the opulence of Ancient Greece for colder climes, living a quieter life in the snow-ravaged realm of the Norse Gods.

Ubisoft shared the warning in a post to its forum, explaining a full download would be required with update 1.4.1 as part of base game restructuring needed in order for the development team to support Valhalla&#x27;s &quot;future content and game updates&quot;.

                    <span>Sonic the Hedgehog is celebrating his 30th birthday this year, and the anniversary festivities are set to continue later this week, with a look at Sonic&#x27;s upcoming movie sequel and next game both now confirmed for the Game Awards. Oh, and a new movie poster has been revealed too.
Sega first unveiled its new Sonic game during the hedgehog&#x27;s special 30th birthday livestream back in May. The accompanying teaser trailer didn&#x27;t offer much beyond a quick snatch of the iconic gaming mascot speeding through a forest, but a later press release named the game - planned to launch on Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2022 - as Sonic Rangers. However, Sega later retracted that name, claiming its inclusion was a mistake.

A new Bloomberg report details the rough journey developer 343 Industries took, leading up to the release of Halo Infinite this week.

                    <span>Authors: Kubernetes 1.23 Release Team
We’re pleased to announce the release of Kubernetes 1.23, the last release of 2021!
This release consists of 47 enhancements: 11 enhancements have graduated to stable, 17 enhancements are moving to beta, and 19 enhancements are entering alpha. Also, 1 feature has been deprecated.
Major Themes
Deprecation of FlexVolume
FlexVolume is deprecated. The out-of-tree CSI driver is the recommended way to write volume drivers in Kubernetes. See this doc for more information. Maintainers of FlexVolume drivers should implement a CSI driver and move users of FlexVolume to CSI. Users of FlexVolume should move their workloads to the CSI driver.
Deprecation of klog specific flags
To simplify the code base, several logging flags were marked as deprecated in Kubernetes …</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but Halo&#x27;s live-action TV adaptation will soon get a proper reveal, courtesy of its first full-length trailer airing at this week&#x27;s Game Awards. Before all that though, there&#x27;s the briefest of new teases to stoke a spot of anticipation and get you in the mood.
The live-action Halo series - which was first announced all the way back in 2013, at the height of Microsoft&#x27;s infatuation with TV, TV, TV - got its first teaser trailer during November&#x27;s Xbox Anniversary Celebration. It admittedly didn&#x27;t show very much - Master Chief popped on his helmet, Cortana said hello - but it was just enough to get fans in the mood.

Ubisoft says the Anno team is &quot;just getting started&quot; on its latest DLC journey and so isn&#x27;t quite ready to reveal specifics just yet. However, its blog post offers a few teases on the direction Seasons 4&#x27;s three planned DLCs will be taking, with the focus this time around said being the New World - in contrast to the Old World focus of Season 3.

                    <span>In case you weren&#x27;t aware just yet, Gran Turismo 7 is all about delivering more of a classical Gran Turismo experience, after the more experimental multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport. Which probably explains why our best look at the game in action to date comes via the reveal of classic circuit Deep Forest, which PlayStation just served up a full in-game onboard playthrough. 
The fictional Deep Forest circuit made its debut alongside the Gran Turismo series way back in 1997, and has been a fan favourite ever since. Its appearance in Gran Turismo 7 is, perhaps unsurprisingly, its most impressive yet, and the lap onboard a GT Lamborghini shows a track that&#x27;s at once visually outstanding while also being remarkably faithful to the PS1 original.

                    <span>From Ontario and not surprising:
Since September 2021, officers have investigated five incidents where suspects have placed small tracking devices on high-end vehicles so they can later locate and steal them. Brand name “air tags” are placed in out-of-sight areas of the target vehicles when they are parked in public places like malls or parking lots. Thieves then track the targeted vehicles to the victim’s residence, where they are stolen from the driveway.
Thieves typically use tools like screwdrivers to enter the vehicles through the driver or passenger door, while ensuring not to set off alarms. Once inside, an electronic device, typically used by mechanics to reprogram the factory setting, is connected to the onboard diagnostics port below the dashboard and programs the vehicle to accept a key the thieves have brought with them. Once the new key is programmed, the vehicle will start and the thieves drive it away...</span>

                    <span>Epic Games has revealed what&#x27;s next for Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 with its all-new &quot;Flipped&quot; trailer, highlighting the island&#x27;s startling new look.
&quot;Due to a particularly cold winter, the first thing you&#x27;ll notice about the Island is that the western half&#x27;s a wintry biome,&quot; the studio teases in the video description. &quot;Perhaps stop by the suburban Greasy Grove, the industrial Logjam Lumberyard, and other locales.

Without pointing to specific posts of concern, Redditor and moderator 343-Guilty-Spark posted a message over the weekend, instructing Halo fans to &quot;take the weekend off&quot; as the subreddit would be closed to comments until tomorrow, Monday 6th December.

In a blog posted earlier today, Yoshida said congested server queues have persisted since the start of Endwalker&#x27;s Early Access period, acknowledging it has been &quot;the cause of many inconveniences to our players&quot;.

                    <span>There are 14 multiplayer modes hidden in Halo Infinite for PC players.
Though the secret modes can only be seen by players accessing the playlist offline - which sounds counter-intuitive, given Halo Infinite is an online multiplayer shooter - players can save and share the playlists, which then makes them playable online.

Although the publisher confirmed it is &quot;still hard at work on building the next singleplayer focused experience for Dragon Age&quot; and that we have to wait until &quot;next year when [EA/BioWare] can talk more about what [they&#x27;re] working on&quot;, the new short stories - written by members of the BioWare team - should help tide us over.

It gives us a peek at an iconic Resident Evil enemy - the Cerberus hound - which looks super cute and healthy at first, until it turns its head and shows the rotting flesh on the other side of its skull before it flashes to the logo.

Washington Post reports that the studio - which co-created Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War with Treyarch - is calling in its quality assurance contractors for meetings between 3rd and 8th December. It&#x27;s here staff will be told if they&#x27;ve been promoted or if they&#x27;ve been made redundant.

The bundle - which was only available to those who could get to the Team LA store at Staples Center, Los Angeles, on Friday afternoon ahead of that evening&#x27;s match against the LA Clippers - was selling for a very reasonable $140 (£105) given the price of a controller alone can set you back £55.

                    <span>Fortnite has pulled off its latest live event - typically spectacular in scope, technically ambitious in scale, and hugely important to the game&#x27;s ongoing story. Tonight&#x27;s The End event closed the book on its Chapter 2 map forever - and gave players a glimpse at what&#x27;s next.
The End event began at the small fort built over the past week by Pleasant Park and, as players arrived, they were greeted by the welcome sight of the friendly Blue Cube teleporting into the location too. It was here players would make their last stand against the Cube Queen, head of the alien race which has now plagued Fortnite&#x27;s reality for several seasons. Maybe, with the Blue Cube on side, she could be defeated?

                    <span>To date, the BioShock series has taken players deep beneath the ocean circa the 1960s, high into the clouds in 1912, not to mention a multitude of lighthouses spanning, possibly, all of space and time and everything between. And now, a new report has seemingly revealed where the next entry in the acclaimed FPS saga will be leading us next.
As spotted by VGC, journalist Colin Moriarty relayed fresh details on 2K Games&#x27; next BioShock project, previously confirmed to be in development at new studio Cloud Chamber, as part of his latest Sacred Symbols video.

                    <span>Sony is reportedly working on a new PlayStation subscription service to rival Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass, which will bundle together the existing PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus as part of a multi-tier membership approach.
The news comes via Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who reports the project - code-named Spartacus and expected to launch in spring 2022 - will provide subscribers with access to a range of both modern and classic for a monthly fee.

                    <span>Usually, the first step after purchasing an expensive bit of portable consumer electronics (apart from turning it on and going &quot;woo&quot;, of course) is to find some sort of case to put it in. Ordinarily this is the point where I just cram my new purchase into a sock with a resigned sigh and have done with it, but Valve has you covered as far as Steam Deck goes, and has offered a look at the cute little carry case all units of its handheld gaming PC will ship with. And also its box.
We&#x27;ve already seen a fair amount of Steam Deck in the run up to its release - including a peek at its innards and the categorisation system Valve is employing so purchasers know exactly what is and isn&#x27;t compatible with their new device on Steam - but the company&#x27;s latest update is all about what&#x27;s on the outside.

With Valhalla&#x27;s one-year anniversary now passed, Ubisoft is still to say exactly what the next year will bring. In the meantime, the game&#x27;s current Oskoreia Festival event has been extended a week until 9th December.

                    <span>Sci-fi movie trilogy The Matrix - in which Keanu Reaves wears a trench coat and gets cross with some machines - is, after nearly a two decade absence from cinemas, making a comeback later this month in Lana Wachowski&#x27;s The Matrix Resurrections, and it looks like there&#x27;ll be some kind of accompanying tie-in &quot;experience&quot; heading to PlayStation 5.
As detailed by Reddit user the_andshrew on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, the new Matrix...thing was discovered listed in the PSN backend, where it was accompanied by an extremely minimal amount of useful information - primarily a couple of database entry numbers, an associated image, and word that it&#x27;ll be coming to PS5.

                    <span>Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Edition - the spruced up version of the spruced up version of everybody&#x27;s favourite comedic rumination on video game agency - has, not entirely unexpectedly given where we are in the year, been delayed yet again. However, there&#x27;s finally light at the end of the long, long tunnel in that it&#x27;s now expected to arrive &quot;early&quot; in 2022.
Stanley Parable&#x27;s Ultra Deluxe Edition was first announced back in 2018, with an anticipated launch of 2019. That, obviously, never came to pass, nor did it do so the following year or, as developers Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows have now revealed, will it do so the year after that. &quot;Hopefully when we all reconvene this time next year for our latest Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Edition update,&quot; I wrote after the game&#x27;s 2020 delay, &quot;it&#x27;ll be to discuss how awesome this fully released thing is, and not to bow our heads as it&#x27;s jettisoned into the following year.&quot; So, uh, sorry for jinxing it, I guess.

Zampella revealed EA&#x27;s plans to create a multiple-game &quot;connected Battlefield universe&quot; in an interview with GameSpot, explaining it would feature an interconnected world with shared characters and stories, and &quot;the player at the center&quot;. The aim of the move, Zampella claimed, is to &quot;grow Battlefield and meet players where they play through various experiences and business models&quot;, including the upcoming Battlefield Mobile.

                    <span>A hacker stole $31 million from the blockchain company MonoX Finance , by exploiting a bug in software the service uses to draft smart contracts.
Specifically, the hack used the same token as both the tokenIn and tokenOut, which are methods for exchanging the value of one token for another. MonoX updates prices after each swap by calculating new prices for both tokens. When the swap is completed, the price of tokenIn­that is, the token sent by the user­decreases and the price of tokenOut­or the token received by the user­increases.
By using the same token for both tokenIn and tokenOut, the hacker greatly inflated the price of the MONO token because the updating of the tokenOut overwrote the price update of the tokenIn. The hacker then exchanged the token for $31 million worth of tokens on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains...</span>

The Kubernetes release train rolls on, and we look ahead to the release of 1.23 next week. As is our tradition, I&#x27;m pleased to bring you a look back at the process that brought us the previous version.
The release team for 1.22 was led by Savitha Raghunathan, who was, at the time, a Senior Platform Engineer at MathWorks. I spoke to Savitha on the Kubernetes Podcast from Google, the weekly* show covering the Kubernetes and Cloud Native ecosystem.
Our release conversations shine a light on the team that puts together each Kubernetes release. Make sure you subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts so you catch the story of 1.23.
And in case you&#x27;re interested in why the show has been on a hiatus the last few weeks, all will be revealed in the next episode!

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been playing Jurassic World Evolution 2 and are of the opinion it very much needs more dinosaurs, you&#x27;re in luck. Frontier has announced the park management sim&#x27;s first paid DLC expansion, which introduces four new Early Cretaceous era creatures.
Arriving exactly one month after Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s release, the Early Cretaceous Pack (as the DLC is unfussily known) costs £5.99/€7.99/$7.99 USD and adds two new new land dinosaurs, one new flying reptile, and one new marine reptile - the Wuerhosaurus, Minmi, Dsungaripterus and Kronosaurus respectively.

                    <span>Politicians in the US have announced a new legislative bill - named the Stopping Grinch Bots Act, after the Dr. Seuss character that stole Christmas - which seeks to curtail the scalping of high demand toys and goods.
The bill, which specifically targets scalpers using bots to snap up online inventories of in-demand items in order to resell them at significantly higher prices, doesn&#x27;t limit its focus to the video games industry, but it would certainly cover items such as consoles and graphics cards - both of which have been hit particularly hard by scalping as a result of supply chain issues worsened during the pandemic.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment has announced it&#x27;ll be delisting the original Titanfall from all digital stores starting today, 1st December, although servers will remain online for existing players.
In a statement announcing the news on Twitter, Respawn called Titanfall, which launched for Xbox and PC in 2014, a part of its DNA - a game that &quot;showcased the ambitions of the studio&quot; and one that &quot;continues to be a beacon of innovation that we strive for in all of our games&quot;. Despite its professed fondness for the title, however, it will be delisted on all digital storefronts starting today and will be removed from all subscription services from 1st March next year.

                    <span>CD Project has provided an update on the continuing post-launch development of its troubled Cyberpunk 2077, confirming a &quot;major update&quot; is planned to launch alongside the game&#x27;s long-awaited next-gen versions in Q1 2022.
As part of its third quarter 2021 report, CD Projekt said it&#x27;s currently &quot;hard at work&quot; on Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions - which were originally due to launch this year before the studio made the decision to push their release into early next year - and that these would be accompanied by a &quot;major update&quot; for all platforms.

                    <span>With the season of spooky fruit mutilation behind us, Sea of Thieves is readying to trade one lot of festivities for another, and will be getting into the spirit of celebration when its jam-packed fifth season sets sail this Thursday, 2nd December.

                    <span>Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s standing on Steam has recently improved - it now has a &quot;Very Positive&quot; user rating and is one of the top-selling games on the platform.
Cyberpunk 2077 suffered a disastrous launch and caused developer CD Projekt severe reputational damage it has yet to recover from. It went so badly, CD Projekt changed how it operates to develop multiple AAA games and expansions in parallel, and only begin promoting its creations much closer to release.

                    <span>Authors: Tim Xu (Tencent Cloud)
Kubernetes v1.22, released in August 2021, introduced a new alpha feature that improves how Linux nodes implement memory resource requests and limits.
In prior releases, Kubernetes did not support memory quality guarantees.
For example, if you set container resources as follows:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: &quot;64Mi&quot;
        cpu: &quot;250m&quot;
      limits:
        memory: &quot;64Mi&quot;
        cpu: &quot;500m&quot;

spec.containers[].resources.requests(e.g. cpu, memory) is designed for scheduling. When you create a Pod, the Kubernetes scheduler selects a node for the Pod to run on. Each node has a maximum capacity for each of the resource types: the amount of CPU and memory it can…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s not really a new Gran Turismo without a shiny new wheel to accompany it, and for the release of Gran Turismo 7 next year Fanatec is doing the honours and pulling out all the stops as it introduces the first direct drive wheel for PlayStation with the GT DD Pro. 

It&#x27;s a piece of hardware that comes with a considerable cost, with the basic bundle that includes the direct drive hub, the bespoke GT rim and a two pedal setup coming in at 699.95EUR, running up to the premium bundle which includes a three-pedal setup and the Boost Kit 180 which increases the peak torque to 8nm. Which basically means more force feedback.

Since its arrival on Switch back in March, Capcom has released a steady flow of post-launch content for Monster Hunter Rise, ranging from the big stuff - which is to say new creatures and a proper conclusion to the Kamura Village story arc - to fun smaller additions, including a series of &#x27;collaborations&#x27; based on various video game properties.

While foundational issues such as the lack of a scoreboard or in-game voice chat have been acknowledged, they&#x27;re not part of the first wave of patches.

The fire, which had broken out in the ceiling of the ride&#x27;s indoor section, was spotted by a Universal Studios employee late on 23rd November, after guests had left the park for the day. According to the Fuji News Network (thanks Nintendo Life) emergency services were immediately contacted and no-one was harmed in the incident.

                    <span>Nintendo is bringing Mario Golf: Super Rush&#x27;s post-launch support to a close with one final free content update, available now on Switch.
Mario Golf: Super Rush teed off with enough of the good stuff to earn itself a Recommended badge back in June, but its launch line-up was bolstered with a free update in August - introducing Toadette, a New Donk City course, and more - and continued to expand in September, adding Koopa Troopa and Ninji as playable characters, Blustery Basin and Spiky Palms as new stages, alongside various other tweaks and improvements.

                    <span>Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, in which developer Yacht Club Games&#x27; iconic spade-bearer embarks on a colourful blend of falling-block puzzling and dungeon-crawling, finally has a release date and will be making its way to Switch, PlayStation, and PC on 13th December.
Announced back in the early part of 2020, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is a collaboration between Yacht Club Games and developer Vine that trades the titular hero&#x27;s previous bouts of acclaimed platform action for top-down puzzling and adventuring. The goal is to work through each single-screen stage by clearing groups of adjacent enemies - lining them up with a quick spade-thwack to create massive chain attacks - in order to progress to the next area.

                    <span>Fortnite Chapter 3 arrives next month, following a climactic live event to conclude the game&#x27;s second Chapter and wave farewell to its current, ever-changing Island map. 
Epic Games confirmed the timing for this season&#x27;s ending live event this afternoon - and acknowledged it would also bookend the game&#x27;s second Chapter. This backs up earlier rumours reported by Eurogamer that Epic planned to deploy Chapter 3 in December, rather than continuing Chapter 2 into a ninth season.

                    <span>I am, dear reader, a big fan of Nurgle. It&#x27;s an odd thing to be a fan of. The putrid Chaos faction is quite possibly the most disgusting thing in all of fantasy, but when it comes to Warhammer, disgusting can be cool. Sort of.
This week, developer Creative Assembly released a cinematic trailer for upcoming strategy game Total War: Warhammer 3, and it showcased Nurgle in all its puss-packed glory. I must say it&#x27;s just about the best Nurgle has looked in any video game ever.

Expeditions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, are effectively No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s stab at live-service-style seasonal content, offering limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the game&#x27;s ever-expanding systems into a series of progression-based challenges - with various cosmetic rewards served up as different milestones are reached.

                    <span>Men of War 2, the sequel to the original cult RTS Men of War, has been announced. It&#x27;s coming in 2022, and being developed by Ukrainian studio Best Way, the same studio behind the originals in the series: Men of War, which came out in 2009, and the proper first game in the series, 2004&#x27;s Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2.
We&#x27;ve seen some extended gameplay in action and had a walkthrough of some of the key features, and were pretty impressed with what we saw. In simple terms, imagine a Company of Heroes game with a bit more complexity to its systems (and maybe a smidge less budget).

Harmonix was founded in 1995 and began carving a rhythm-action niche for itself with the 2001 release of celebrated PS2-exclusive Frequency and its much-loved sequel Amplitude. 2005 saw the studio release Guitar Hero, arguably its most impactful game to date, which would go on to spawn a steady succession of sequels - although the developer would soon leave the series behind to expand on Guitar Hero&#x27;s plastic instrument premise with 2007&#x27;s Rock Band.

Party Spectacular, as season six is officially known, brings with it five new rounds, 25 new costumes, and a new 50-tier progression track with associated rewards. There&#x27;s also a special Sackboy-themed limited-time event, the return of custom usernames, the addition of cross-progression between PlayStation and PC, and more.

                    <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 sales aren&#x27;t great and Elite Dangerous: Odyssey under-performed, developer Frontier has said.
In a trading update, the Cambridge-based company said sales of Jurassic World Evolution 2 were &quot;lower than expected&quot; on the PC platform specifically. Frontier believes this is the &quot;short-term effect&quot; of a crowded release window, with a number of other highly-anticipated PC games launching in the same window.

Unfortunately it also breaks mods. What&#x27;s more, because the recently released Anniversary Edition is actually an upgrade to the previously released Special Edition, the update will affect owners of either version.

If you&#x27;ve yet to experience Rusty Lake&#x27;s deliciously surreal output - a collection of, so far, 15 games, all serving up a darkly atmospheric slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant - they&#x27;re well worth checking out.

                    <span>Rockstar has apologised for the &quot;unexpected&quot; technical issues plaguing its widely lambasted Grand Theft Auto: Trilogy - Definitive Edition release, promising to put the classic versions of the games back on sale on PC and making them free to owners of the remaster.
Rockstar&#x27;s Definitive Edition, developed by Grove Street Games, launched last week and immediately attracted ire for its myriad issues, including progression crashes, a widely documented procession of (admittedly sometimes hilarious) bugs, poor performance across all consoles, and a host of art concerns.

Starting with the free additions, Flight Simulator&#x27;s 1.21.12.0 update introduces a total of five new aircraft, some very different to those seen in the base game. The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, for instance, is Asobo&#x27;s first military jet, while the VoloCity is its first eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, capable of pinpoint landings and described as a taster for the proper arrival of helicopters in Flight Simulator next year.

Speaking to Eurogamer in a new interview, Joseph Staten, Head of Creative at 343 Industries, said the recent extension of Halo Infinite Season 1 to May 2022 means the releases of campaign co-op and Forge mode have also been pushed back from their initial announced target launch windows.

                    <span>Rowhammer is an attack technique involving accessing — that’s “hammering” — rows of bits in memory, millions of times per second, with the intent of causing bits in neighboring rows to flip. This is a side-channel attack, and the result can be all sorts of mayhem.
Well, there is a new enhancement:
All previous Rowhammer attacks have hammered rows with uniform patterns, such as single-sided, double-sided, or n-sided. In all three cases, these “aggressor” rows — meaning those that cause bitflips in nearby “victim” rows — are accessed the same number of times. ...</span>

                    <span>Cult classic platform star Earthworm Jim, first seen on Super Nintendo and Mega Drive back in the early 90s, is returning to television in a brand-new animated series.
As those of a certain age may recall, Earthworm Jim&#x27;s early video game success saw the space-faring invertebrate make the jump to television once before, way back in the mists of 1995 with an animated TV show that ran for two seasons and 23 episodes.

                    <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has written to staff saying he is &quot;evaluating all aspects&quot; of Xbox&#x27;s relationship with Activision Blizzard in light of a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming Activision CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.
In an email seen by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier - and later confirmed by Microsoft in a statement to IGN - Spencer told Xbox employees he and the gaming leadership team were &quot;disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions&quot; at Activision Blizzard, and that &quot;this type of behaviour has no place in our industry&quot;.

                    <span>Ninja Theory&#x27;s acclaimed 2017 action-adventure, Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice, has just received a new update, bringing August&#x27;s Xbox Series X enhancements over to PC. Additionally, a range of new accessibility features have been introduced to both versions.
The official description for Hellblade&#x27;s PC enhancements is a little vague, with Ninja Theory only promising &quot;enriched visuals&quot;, alongside DirectX Raytracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and AMD FSR support. However, the new PC release will almost certainly reflect the Xbox Series X version, which introduced the likes of upgraded materials, particles, and draw distances.

                    <span>Sifu, the striking martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, will be making its way to PlayStation and PC a little sooner than expected. Its arrival date has been revised to 8th February, a few weeks earlier than its originally anticipated 22nd February release.
Announcing the revised launch, Absolver explained it wanted to get Sifu into players hands a little sooner so they &quot;can enjoy playing [it] ahead of an incredibly big month for highly anticipated AAA releases&quot;. If Sifu had stuck to its original release date it would have been jostling up against the likes of Destiny 2&#x27;s The Witch Queen expansion, Horizon: Forbidden West, and the mighty Elden Ring.
