                              <span>Locks that use Bluetooth Low Energy to authenticate keys are vulnerable to remote unlocking. The research focused on Teslas, but the exploit is generalizable.
In a video shared with Reuters, NCC Group researcher Sultan Qasim Khan was able to open and then drive a Tesla using a small relay device attached to a laptop which bridged a large gap between the Tesla and the Tesla owner’s phone.
“This proves that any product relying on a trusted BLE connection is vulnerable to attacks even from the other side of the world,” the UK-based firm said in a statement, referring to the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol—technology used in millions of cars and smart locks which automatically open when in close proximity to an authorised device...</span>

Stellaris, a sort of space-faring amalgam of grand strategy and 4X action, burst onto the scene back in 2016 to significant acclaim. Six years on, it&#x27;s a substantially different beast, with Paradox having made some sweeping changes along the way, most notably in its radical 2.0 release.
The many faceted road to galactic supremacy it present is still a tonne of strategic fun though, even if - as is generally the way with Paradox titles - the purity of the base game has now been somewhat muddied by an increasingly unwieldy stack of post-launch DLC.

                              <span>If you were roaring at the starting line ready to race into Redout 2 later this month, you might want to cool your engines (sorry, I&#x27;ll stop this now); developer 34BigThings has announced a short delay for its stylish anti-grav racing sequel, with the game now set to release on 16th June.


Redout 2, which was originally expected to launch on 26th May, builds on the superb racing action of its 2016 predecessor with a whole new set of tracks (36 in total, plus mirror variants of each) alongside expanded customisation options - with players now able to start with one of 12 distinct chassis and strap on the likes of new rocket engines, propulsors, stabilsers, rudders, magnets, intercoolers, flaps, wings, and spoilers.


There&#x27;s also online multiplayer racing for up to 12 challengers, plus a single-player career campaign, promising &quot;hundreds&quot; of events from a variety of different modes, including Arena Races, Time Attacks, Last Man Standing, and Boss Races.

                              <span>After one hell of a long wait, the live-action Halo TV adaptation finally arrived earlier this year, and the response has been...mixed. And now Marcus Lehto, co-creator of the videogame series that started all, has shared his own thoughts on the adaptation, saying that while he doesn&#x27;t &quot;hate&quot; it, he was ultimately &quot;confused by many of the choices that were made&quot;.


Paramount+&#x27;s Halo adaptation finally launched for US audiences this March - a mere nine years after it was originally announced - and while changes were expected (fans were forewarned that the TV show takes place in the so-called Silver Timeline, separate from the core Halo canon), the end result has certainly proven divisive.


While it was Master Chief&#x27;s amusing loss of inhibitions that drew the most headlines over the series&#x27; run - just episodes after he&#x27;d stunned audiences by showing his face for the first time, he&#x27;d got his bum out, then ended the series having sex in front of his mum - there&#x27;s been plenty of criticism around the show&#x27;s writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing.

In a new interview with Leo, Reedus - the actor behind lead role, Sam Porter Bridges - discussed Death Stranding and said simply: &quot;We just started the second one.&quot;

                              <span>Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers is a brand new film out today on Disney+. For some reason, it features Ugly Sonic.


Ugly Sonic, as you&#x27;ll no doubt be aware, was the original design for Sonic in the 2020 film before fans complained. His dodgy teeth and human eyes were removed, eventually leading to a decent film and better sequel.




But now he&#x27;s back and... uglier than ever before. Honestly, it&#x27;s terrifying.

Just added for Global Accessibility Awareness Day are new badges for viewers to identify as audio or video only, so streamers can see those with a limited channel experience.


Earlier this year the platform began working with accessibility consultants to review the Creator Stream Manager dashboard on web, mobile apps, and the core UI library to improve accessibility across the board.

When this update goes live, players will be able to continue on with their adventures in The Chasm. But they will not be alone there, as they will join a new team of &quot;diverse members&quot; to &quot;discover a long-sealed history about the people, monsters and the yakshas&quot;.
In addition a to new story quest and challenges, two new playable characters will also be introduced to the game. Their names are Yelan and Kuki Shinobu and HoYoverse has assured us they will be &quot;capable allies&quot;. Yelan is described as a &quot;mysterious figure with many faces and identities&quot; and will use a bow as her weapon of choice. Meanwhile, Kuki is a &quot;surprisingly reliable and capable deputy leader of the Arataki Gang&quot; who uses a sword and can manipulate the Electro element. You can check out the new trailer for Version 2.7 below.

It seemed to be the bargain of the year, if not century, for the holding company. 
Now, in its financial report, Embracer has highlighted its hopes for the future following this acquisition (including potential remakes of some classic titles) saying, &quot;after the end of the quarter, we further strengthened our development capabilities and IP-portfolio by entering into an agreement to acquire Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal, including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain and other IPs.
&quot;We see a great potential, not only in sequels, but also in remakes, remasters, spinoffs, as well as transmedia projects across the Group.&quot;

The Xbox Play team has daily streams on the main Xbox Twitch channel. Since April, the team has partnered with Sorenson (a communications company with the largest global interpreter base) to launch a dedicated ASL channel with around 25 hours of streams a week.

The heavily-delayed mobile version of the embattled eFootball 2022 arrives eight months after eFootball 2022 first launched and was widely panned.


Also on 2nd June, the 1.1.0 update for eFootball 2022 on PC and console comes out - the first update since season one launched in April. &quot;Too little, too late,&quot; was Eurogamer&#x27;s verdict.

As tweeted by Sony Bend Studio, the stealth game will include trophies - including a platinum. &quot;Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include Trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus,&quot; it said.


It&#x27;s unknown, however, if other classics will also have this feature.

Kubernetes v1.24 introduces alpha support for Non-Graceful Node Shutdown. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shutdown or in a non-recoverable state such as hardware failure or broken OS.
How is this different from Graceful Node Shutdown
You might have heard about the Graceful Node Shutdown capability of Kubernetes,
and are wondering how the Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature is different from that. Graceful Node Shutdown
allows Kubernetes to detect when a node is shutting down cleanly, and handles that situation appropriately.
A Node Shutdown can be &quot;graceful&quot; only if the node shutdown action can be detected by the kubelet ahead

Mysteries were originally discussed back in January, when Rare laid out its plans for Sea of Thieves in 2022. The big gambit this year, if you&#x27;re unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.


It&#x27;s a promising idea that so far doesn&#x27;t really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves&#x27; initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation. But with three Adventures now under its belt, Rare is ready to launch the other major component of 2022&#x27;s ambitious narrative plans: Mysteries.

                              <span>EA has announced two new small-scale Kit expansions for The Sims 4 - one themed around evening fashion, the other around camping for kids - with both due to release on 26th May. Astute readers may note the word werewolf is yet to feature, despite previous teases from EA, but there&#x27;s still some hope it seems...


The first of EA&#x27;s newly announced expansions is the Moonlight Chic Kit, which appears to primarily focus its attention on new clothing options for your little digital pals, offering up new looks, designed by Parisian creator Paola Locatelli, said to be &quot;perfect for all the experiences a Sim will encounter during a night out on the town&quot;.


Expect &quot;slinky dresses, flowing shirts and smart jackets, all of which can be styled with sneakers for casual fun or dressed up with some silk and sparkles for a romantic date.&quot;

                              <span>Ben Brode, the charismatic former boss of Blizzard&#x27;s card battler Hearthstone, has finally revealed his new project. It&#x27;s called Marvel Snap, and is a new multiplayer collectible card game filled with comic book characters.

Brode quit Blizzard back in 2018, after more than 15 years at the company, and before its more recent troubles became public. Alongside others who had worked with him to launch Hearthstone, Brode went on to found his own studio, Second Dinner, which has been working on Marvel Snap ever since with Chinese outfit Nuverse, the gaming arm of TikTok owner Bytedance.


Snap&#x27;s focus is on short, unique matches which &quot;cut out the fluff&quot; and last around three minutes total. Player decks are smaller - 15 cards or fewer - and both players act simultaneously, rather than waiting for the other person to finish.

                              <span>System of a Down singer Serj Tankian has joined the growing selection of artists contributing to upcoming music-themed first-person shooter Metal: Hellsinger.


Metal: Hellsinger, which was revealed back in June 2020, is the work of developer The Outsiders - the studio co-founded by former Battlefield 3 lead designer and Payday 2 director David Goldfarb - and promises to developer plenty of furious gun-based demon-slaying, all synced up to a metal soundtrack.


Each of the game&#x27;s stages will feature its own track, with the player&#x27;s power increasing - alongside the complexity of the music, from atmospheric background ambience all the way up to big metal anthems - if they manage to keep their attacks timed to the beat.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we&#x27;re talking PlayStation Plus Premium, and our thoughts on whether it&#x27;s worth the price based on what we know so far. 

The thing is, there are still several questions about what it will provide - even now, less than a week away from its initial rollout in Asia. What is its full game list? How good will its streaming be? And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet &amp; Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? 
The biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield&#x27;s delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

&quot;Aspyr has gone full in to make this the best game that they can make. When we acquired Aspyr, we knew from the start that they would require our assistance [and] Saber has tremendous expertise in creating these types of products,&quot; he said.

The update has not yet been officially announced by Ubisoft, but details of its impending arrival on PlayStation 5 were scooped up by PlayStationSize, a Twitter account which regularly crawls behind the scenes of the PlayStation Store.


Patch notes for the update include an option to enable a &quot;higher framerate&quot; on PS5, and a &quot;franchise menu&quot;. The update is expected to launch next week.

Arizona man Nathan Harris is trying to launch the suit, which claims Hearthstone tricks players into non-refundable purchases without knowing the odds of rare cards (thanks, Polygon). 


In particular, Harris complains that his daughter - who used his credit card without asking - did not realise you could not get a refund from packs which &quot;almost never received any valuable cards&quot;. The game also lacks parental controls, Harris complained.

                              <span>The PS5 and Xbox Series X/S update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will release in Q4 2022, CD Projekt has confirmed. 


The announcement was made as part of the seventh anniversary celebrations for the game&#x27;s release on last-gen consoles and PC.


This is welcome news for Witcher fans, who last month got the bad news that the upgrade was delayed indefinitely after  its development was moved in-house from Saber Interactive.

                              <span>Max Hoberman, CEO of Halo co-developer Certain Affinity, has shared a message with staff regarding recent political events, namely those involving personal health and privacy matters and the recent draft from the US Supreme Court to potentially overturn Roe vs. Wade.
&quot;As a business leader it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to navigate highly politicised issues like transgender and abortion rights. But I&#x27;m not content to sit back and say or do nothing,&quot; he tweeted, before sharing an in-depth message he had sent out to his employees.
This message reads: &quot;It is appalling that states, including the [Certain Affinity] headquarters&#x27; home state of Texas, are wading into what I consider personal health and privacy matters. Recently this encompassed gross intrusions on the rights and dignity of transgender youth, putting politics over the physical and emotional health and wellbeing of a vulnerable population, and threatening their families, friends, doctors and other supporters.

                              <span>Square Enix is continuing to support Babylon&#x27;s Fall with a second season of content, despite the fact barely anyone is playing it.



Game directors Kenji Saito and Takahisa Sugiyama were interviewed and discussed difficulties with developing a live service game.



&quot;It is our first time developing and amending content after release as part of a live service, so we need to prioritise player feedback above all else. In that sense, it really brings home the realisation that this game is very much a service as well as a standalone product,&quot; said Saito.

  Fortunately (or to the chagrin of Activision), there have since been numerous leaks revealing what&#x27;s ahead for  the first-person shooter series. 


First, there&#x27;s a brand-new game mode called DMZ, an extraction-style mode similar to Escape From Tarkov.

&quot;Not only have we redesigned our UI to allow for more flexibility and readability, but we have also rebuilt controller remapping from the ground up and added more customization to our combat and interaction systems. We have retained all our accessibility features from 2018&#x27;s God of War and expanded upon them to include more than 60 ways to adjust gameplay to best suit your style and needs,&quot; reads a PlayStation Blog on the topic.

                              <span>You can now watch the first episode of the Pokémon: Hisuian Snow anime series on YouTube or through Pokémon TV.
The show&#x27;s debut episode, which is called &quot;Onto the Icy Blue&quot;, introduces us to a boy named Alec. During his youth, Alec was led to believe that Pokémon and people could not live peacefully together. This is due to the Pokémon&#x27;s powers, which the humans fear. However, when an older and wiser Alec goes to visit his father the Hisui region (of Arceus fame), he starts to look back on his childhood and recalls an encounter with a wild and (characteristically) timid Zorua. 
It is a short but adorable watch, and perfect to enjoy with a nice cup of tea. So, that&#x27;s your cue. Pop the kettle on, then come back and settle on in with the first episode, which can be watched below.

                              <span>Today brings a look at gameplay for Fallout: London, the upcoming Fallout 4 PC mod that lets you explore the UK&#x27;s post-apocalyptic capital.


It&#x27;s planned to be about the size of the base game&#x27;s Commonwealth map, making this a hugely ambitious piece of DLC.


&quot;The mod encapsulates the gritty, adventurous nature of the Fallout games with a new world, factions, storylines, NPCs, weapons, creatures, and much more! This all comes together in a package tied with a uniquely British bow,&quot; reads the press release.

                              <span>A new mod for God of War shows off something I never imagined - but now I&#x27;ve seen it, I can&#x27;t take my eyes off it: Homer and Bart Simpson stepping into the shoes of Kratos and Atreus. 
Oh, and you know The Stranger (wink wink) we all meet at the beginning of the game - well, thanks to this mod, he becomes the Hi-diddly-hoing Ned Flanders.
The mod comes from Omega Fantasy (via IGN) and uses the character models from 2003&#x27;s The Simpson&#x27;s Hit and Run. And to be honest, if all this mod did was swap out God of War&#x27;s characters for those from Hit and Run, it would have still been an incredibly amusing watch.

But now, players have also found a questionable method of farming XP - in King Kong&#x27;s private parts. 


A clip posted on the Warzone subreddit shows a player flying a helicopter toward&#x27;s King Kong&#x27;s giant testicles (which is easier said than done as Kong tends to crush anyone that heads towards him).

                              <span>Bungie has responded to the recent terrorist attack in Buffalo that resulted in the deaths of ten people and the injury of three others by announcing a new charity initiative and pledging to bolster its ongoing efforts &quot;to maintain safe and anti-racist spaces&quot; within its community.


&quot;On Saturday, 14th May, a young white man drove hours from his home to a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, and opened fire in a crowded supermarket, killing ten people and maiming three others,&quot; Bungie said in a statement. &quot;It has since been confirmed that this was an act of terror aimed at Black Americans and is being investigated as a hate crime. Our hearts go out to the victims of this tragedy, and anyone impacted by this act of violence.&quot;


The studio, in collaboration with its Black at Bungie inclusion club, has announced a number of initiatives in response to the attack. It will, for instance, donate all profits made through the sale of its Be Heard collectable pin over the next 12 months to the Southern Poverty Law Center - a charity whose work includes &quot;monitoring hate groups and other extremists throughout the United States and exposing their activities to the public, the media, and law enforcement.&quot;

The funding package will also allow for Frogwares to supply its team with specialised equipment and migrate its data infrastructure.

                              <span>Sony has released its first PlayStation 5 bundle that includes Horizon Forbidden West.


The bundle has been spotted across UK stores - though of course it&#x27;s mostly sold out.


Released earlier this year, Horizon Forbidden West is Sony&#x27;s current premiere title for the console, though it was somewhat overshadowed by the release of Elden Ring a week later. This bundle should help to boost the game&#x27;s profile.

                              <span>EA DICE has removed the 128-player Breakthrough offering from Battlefield 2042 in its latest patch.


Update 4.1, which released today, has made substantial changes to the game&#x27;s All-Out Warfare playlists, which are available on current-gen consoles and PC. 


In a blog post, DICE explained the removal of 128-player Breakthrough lobbies was necessary to increase &quot;the value and impact of an individual player&quot;, as they currently were full of &quot;intensity and chaos&quot;.

Attorney general Letitia James announced the investigation last night, in response to the attack which killed 10 people and wounded three more. 


The perpetrator livestreamed the attack via Twitch for two minutes before the video was removed. Before the attack took place, he had posted numerous messages discussing and promoting his plans via Discord, as well as on the notorious imageboards 4chan and 8chan. All will now be part of James&#x27; invesitigation.

                              <span>Amanita Design - the developer behind the acclaimed likes of Samorost, Machinarium, Creaks, and last year&#x27;s surreal horror Happy Games - has unveiled its latest project: &quot;hand-crafted&quot; dystopian adventure Phonopolis.
Phonopolis, which makes use of actual corrugated cardboard sets and a 12fps stop-motion animation style inspired by classic animated films, casts players as Felix, a thoughtful young man who must try and stop the titular city&#x27;s authoritarian leader from playing the Absolute tone - an occurrence that would effectively cause Felix and his fellow citizens to lose their humanity.
What follows is a story-driven puzzle adventure encompassing &quot;relatable, real-world themes&quot;, including manipulation and individualism. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll be heavy going, though; Amanita says Phonopolis will explore its subject matter in a &quot;playful and light-hearted&quot; way.

                              <span>Naughty Dog&#x27;s much-rumoured, but as yet still unannounced, The Last of Us remake for PlayStation 5 will reportedly launch before the end of this year.


Word of a PlayStation 5 remake for The Last of Us first surfaced in April 2021 when Bloomberg reported the project had initially been in the works at Sony&#x27;s San Diego-based Visual Arts Service Group before Naughty Dog was asked to take over. Further evidence of the project&#x27;s existence emerged earlier this year, when a member of Naughty Dog&#x27;s QA team listed an &quot;unannounced remake&quot; on their resumé - a reference since removed.


Yet while there&#x27;s still no official word on a Last of Us remake, rumours of the project continue to swirl, with ever-leaky GamesBeat reporter Jeff Grubb now claiming it&#x27;s set for a 2022 release.

                              <span>Thunderful Games, the studio formed after the merger of developers Zoink and Image &amp; Form, has confirmed it currently has four SteamWorld titles in the works, including the previously announced SteamWorld Headhunter.


Headhunter - a &quot;stylised and colourful, third-person co-op action adventure&quot; that was announced last November - initially looked like it would be the sixth entry in the celebrated series, following on from SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Heist, SteamWorld Dig 2, and SteamWorld Quest. That may no longer be the case, however.


According to Thunderful&#x27;s latest earnings report (thanks IGN), Headhunter, which is now scheduled for a 2023 release, won&#x27;t be the only SteamWorld title coming that year. An accompany release schedule reveals that Thunderful has three additional, currently unannounced SteamWorld games in development, with two of those also due in 2023.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play team-based sports game Roller Champions finally has a release date and will, after a bit of a delay earlier this year, be launching next Wednesday, 25th May on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


Roller Champions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is Ubisoft&#x27;s stab at creating the kind of knockabout sports mash-up that&#x27;s made Rocket League such a perennial favourite, playing out like a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football - wherein two teams of three hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another and score a goal.


Is it any good? Time will tell, but Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell was pretty impressed when he played an early version shortly after its E3 2019 unveiling, calling it &quot;honestly one of the demos I found hardest to tear myself away from.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Spiders&#x27; scrappy but enjoyable RPG GreedFall is getting a sequel, and it&#x27;ll be launching for PC and unspecified consoles in 2024. Or next year - publisher Nacon&#x27;s press release and YouTube description currently disagree, which I&#x27;m trying to get to the bottom of.


When the original GreedFall launched in 2019, its combination of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice struck a bit of a chord despite its unavoidable rough edges, quickly raising its profile through plenty of positive word of mouth - ultimately, to the tune of over 2m sales - as players got stuck into its ambitious historical fantasy yarn.


&quot;GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults,&quot; said Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield in her review at the time, &quot;and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings.&quot;

The Road to Zero plan was first concieved in 2010, when Sony announced it as a &quot;a long-term global environmental plan... to realise a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of Sony&#x27;s products and business activities&quot;. Originally, this target of carbon neutrality was set for 2050. However, today the company released a statement revealing a new target year of 2040.
&quot;Sony will accelerate its target year for carbon neutrality, that is, greenhouse gas emissions of virtually zero, from 2050 to 2040. Specifically, Sony intends to make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations carbon neutral by 2030, and by 2040, in addition to scopes 1 and 2, Sony will also target other emissions originating from stages such as products, supply chains, and logistics (scope 3), aiming for net zero emissions achieved in all scopes.&quot;

It&#x27;s... very NSFW.


Logjam is the latest game from famed creator Robert Yang, following the likes of Hard Lads, Rinse and Repeat, and The Tearoom in exploring gay sexuality.

                              <span>Last week, I got to have a closer look at the Saints Row reboot from Volition. As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.
However, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this &quot;stuff&quot; to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.
Throughout the showcase, Saints Row&#x27;s fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss&#x27; face, you could clearly see that the character&#x27;s eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss&#x27;, although their eye did look jarred as well).

                              <span>Following my hands off preview of the Saints Row reboot, I sat down and chatted more with Volition developers Kenzie Lindgren (associate UX designer) and Damien Allen (principal designer). We covered a broad range of topics, including plenty on what&#x27;s new for this entry, but we started by discussing why Saints Row aficionados should come back to the series, despite its brand-new cast and setting. 


&quot;It definitely still feels like Saints Row - even if it&#x27;s not the same characters, even if it&#x27;s not the same setting, even if it&#x27;s not exactly the same as before - it feels like Saints Row,&quot; Lindgren said.


&quot;I feel that every single time I go into the game, whether that&#x27;s just customisation (because customisation is a huge part of it), whether that&#x27;s travelling around the city, whether that&#x27;s wing suiting and doing the missions, it feels like Saints Row. And I think that&#x27;s at least worth checking out if you&#x27;re an older player, but also for a newer player to discover that feeling for the first time.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 news will come next month, according to director Tetsuya Nomura.


During a Japanese livestream covering the mobile battle royale Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier, Nomura mentioned that news would be coming next month as part of the Final Fantasy 7 25th anniversary.


Presumably this could be news on part two of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, as well as other projects in the works.

This paid-for add-on lets you fling birds at pigs, as is tradition, now in blocky 3D.  There&#x27;s a story mode, which plays like a classic Minecraft map, or a full-on version of the classic Angry Birds gameplay, converted into Minecraft.

The expansion is the work of Oreville Studios, a developer dedicated to building content on the Minecraft Marketplace platform, and looks... decent? Here&#x27;s a trailer showing gameplay:

                              <span>For those who had a PlayStation 3 in 2009, Shatter was a must play. Its block-busting gameplay was married with a slamming soundtrack that made it an ideal way to pass some time while waiting for the release of Fast and Furious and other classics of that year. However, if you didn&#x27;t have the chance to bop along with this sci-fi puzzler then, now is your chance. 
Yes, that&#x27;s right, the game is getting remastered. And, not only that, it is also coming to even more consoles than before. In &quot;late 2022&quot;, you will be able to play Shatter Remastered Deluxe on Windows and Mac for PC (via Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. You are, quite simply, spoiled for choice. 
You can check out the announcement trailer for Shatter Remastered Deluxe below.

As reported back in March, hair and fur textures were tanking the frame rate when played on PC - sometimes as low as 8FPS. Modders have released fixes which make all characters bald in a bid to alleviate the issue.



Now an update has been released for the game, in which &quot;models for hair and fur associated with important characters have been revised to improve performance.&quot;

                              <span>Solo developer Stephen Ddungu believes Disney and Marvel likely copied his indie game for an eye-catching fight sequence in the recent Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.


Ddungu has been chronicling his work on music-based JRPG Sword of Symphony via Tiktok, where footage of the game&#x27;s combat system has notched up millions of views (thanks, Kotaku). 


His game allows you to conjur glowing musical notes in mid-air and send them flinging towards an enemy. If you&#x27;ve seen the new Doctor Strange, you&#x27;ll likely recognise that description - since a short sequence in the film sees Benedict Cumberbatch doing just that.

                              <span>Following Activision Blizzard&#x27;s reveal of its Diversity Space Tool, a video of a GDC 2017 presentation has resurfaced online.


In the video, presenters of the tool embarrassingly apply their findings to Nintendo&#x27;s series.


Apparently the game lacks diversity in ability and sexual orientation, as the characters aren&#x27;t disabled and are all presumed straight. How you can tell someone&#x27;s sexual orientation just by looking at them is beyond me.

The investment means the PIF is now Nintendo&#x27;s fifth-largest shareholder, Bloomberg reported this morning. 


In response, Nintendo said it learned of the stake from news reports and declined to comment further.

Rumours surfaced earlier this week that a remake of the PS2 horror game was in the works, alongside other projects in the series.


However, speaking to IGN at Polish games conference Digital Dragons, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno said he cannot comment, but the studio hopes to make an announcement on future projects &quot;as soon as we can&quot;.

                              <span>Researchers have demonstrated iPhone malware that works even when the phone is fully shut down.
t turns out that the iPhone’s Bluetooth chip­ — which is key to making features like Find My work­ — has no mechanism for digitally signing or even encrypting the firmware it runs. Academics at Germany’s Technical University of Darmstadt figured out how to exploit this lack of hardening to run malicious firmware that allows the attacker to track the phone’s location or run new features when the device is turned off.
[…]
The research is the first — or at least among the first — to study the risk posed by chips running in low-power mode. Not to be confused with iOS’s low-power mode for conserving battery life, the low-power mode (LPM) in this research allows chips responsible for near-field communication, ultra wideband, and Bluetooth to run in a special mode that can remain on for 24 hours after a device is turned off...</span>

                              <span>From Elden Ring on Game Boy to that Advance Wars/Mass Effect mash-up, demakes are all the rage these days - and now it&#x27;s classic first-person puzzler Portal&#x27;s turn to get the retro port treatment, courtesy of a new fan project to rebuild it for N64.


Portal, of course, released back in 2007 as part of Valve&#x27;s legendary Orange Box collection, where it immediately wrought cake memes, Companion Cubes and iconic antagonist GLaDOS upon an unsuspecting world. It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.


The currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve&#x27;s classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.

                              <span>Following recent reports that Sony is refusing to approve any statements from PlayStation studios relating to reproductive rights, Bungie - whose acquisition by Sony was announced in February - has said &quot;there will never be a &#x27;muzzle&#x27; big enough to stop us from standing up for what&#x27;s right&quot;.
Bungie was one of the first studios to speak out in support of Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the US, following recent reports the US Supreme Court was trying to overturn the ruling. At the time, the developer called the move a &quot;direct attack on human rights&quot;, adding that &quot;standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values&quot;.
However, in light of reports that Sony is refusing to authorise any public statements its PlayStation studios might want to make around the issue of reproductive rights, some Bungie fans have questioned whether the developer will still be able to express its opinion so freely once its acquisition by Sony is complete.

                              <span>Developer The Bearded Ladies, the studio behind 2018&#x27;s acclaimed turn-based strategy adventure Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, has unveiled Miasma Chronicles - a new tactical RPG that&#x27;s heading to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 some time next year.


Miasma Chronicles unfolds in a United States torn apart by a force known only as the Miasma, some time in the &quot;not-too-distant future&quot;. Here, in the mining town of Sedentary, we meet our protagonist Elvis, a young man raised by a robotic older &quot;brother&quot; after being left by his mother. 


Elvis, for reasons both unknown and extremely convenient as far as gameplay goes, has access to a mysterious glove that enables him to control Miasma - a device that&#x27;ll almost certainly prove useful as the brothers set out across the post-apocalyptic wasteland in search of answers that might &quot;change the course of human history forever.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Bohemia Interactive has, following an extensive leak over the weekend, officially unveiled Arma Reforger, the next step in its long-running first-person military shooter series. Described as the &quot;first milestone on the long road to Arma 4&quot;, Reforger launches into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access today.


Bohemia opened a lengthy livestream earlier today with confirmation that the long-awaited Arma 4 is in development (its predecessor, Arma 3, celebrates its 10th birthday next year), but the remainder of the stream&#x27;s focus was very much on Reforger. It&#x27;s being called a new standalone &quot;platform&quot; for the series, consisting of several key parts; there&#x27;s a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.


Reforger&#x27;s sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia&#x27;s previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001&#x27;s Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer&#x27;s latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.

                              <span>Fortnite has teased the return of an enormous icon from its original Island, as the clock counts down to the game&#x27;s latest big season finale.


While not yet confirmed by developer Epic Games, eagle-eyed Fortnite leakers are confident this season will end in another of the game&#x27;s eye-catching live events - the first of 2022 - likely on Saturday, 4th June.


This afternoon, Epic itself issued a typically cryptic teaser with snippets of audio and an unmistakable logo at the end: the fan-favourite Mech (or Mecha Team Leader, to give its full name) which duelled and ultimately beat Fortnite&#x27;s Devourer monster in one of the game&#x27;s most memorable moments back in 2019.

                              <span>May&#x27;s second crop of games headed to Xbox Game Pass includes Jurassic World Evolution 2, available today, plus Sniper Elite 5 and Pac-Man Museum+.


Jurassic World Evolution 2 is the dinosaur management sim sequel which adds in plenty of new features and creatures, including flying and airborne reptiles. 


Developer Frontier last year admitted the game had under-performed, something it blamed on the delay of the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion movie, now due in June. Here&#x27;s hoping Xbox Game Pass gives it fresh legs.

                              <span>Lost Ark still has a bot problem, publisher Amazon Games has admitted. 


In a blog post acknowledging the continued issue and the ongoing &quot;frustration within the community&quot; it said it had felt too, Amazon announced it had permanently banned &quot;several million accounts that participated in botting, hacking or gold-selling&quot;.


&quot;Since Lost Ark launched, we&#x27;ve been fighting a war against the bots infiltrating Arkesia,&quot; Amazon dramatically wrote. &quot;Addressing bots can be especially challenging in free-to-play games because it&#x27;s so easy to create an account and enter the game, but we&#x27;re working on multiple fronts to fight them.&quot;

                              <span>Red Dead Online publisher Take-Two has acknowledged fan frustration over the lack of meaningful updates to Rockstar&#x27;s online cowboy offering - though said it was up to developer Rockstar to say what it was - or wasn&#x27;t - up to.


Speaking to IGN, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he had &quot;heard the frustration&quot; surrounding the game from fans who felt sidelined, and who have campaigned for more content using the hashtag #SaveRedDeadOnline. 


&quot;Rockstar Games talks about the updates that are coming, and we&#x27;re working on an awful lot at Rockstar Games,&quot; Zelnick said. &quot;I&#x27;ve heard the frustration, it&#x27;s flattering that they want more content, and more will be said by Rockstar in due time.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 15 has now sold more than 10m copies worldwide since its launch back in November 2016.


The new sales milestone was announced today via the official Final Fantasy 15 Twitter account.


While a sizable number, it&#x27;s interesting to compare it to the 11.8m copies sold by the Square Enix-published Rise of the Tomb Raider, launched back in 2015, or the 14.5m copies sold by the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot - especially in light of Square Enix ditching its western game studios, such as Tomb Raider&#x27;s Crystal Dynamics.

Speaking to IGN, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said Take-Two - a potential new home for the FIFA brand, post-EA - was keen to continue expanding its sports portfolio, but did not have anything to announce regarding FIFA at the moment. 


&quot;We&#x27;re definitely interested in expanding our opportunities in sports,&quot; Zelnick said, &quot;and FIFA has a great brand and incredible clout, but we have no current plans to discuss.&quot;

The sale to Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive marks another studio gone from Improbable, as it ditches its previous designs on video game development backed by its ever-nebulous SpatialOS cloud technology.

As a result of the sale, Scavengers&#x27; console versions - currently being tested via a closed alpha - have been cancelled, Eurogamer has been told. Its PC version currently remains alive, as a small internal team keeps it operational.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has released a suitably ridiculous new cinematic trailer for its Smash-Bros-like free-to-play crossover brawler Multiversus, confirming a handful of previously unannounced playable characters alongside the news its open beta will be launching this July.


Multiversus was officially unveiled last November following a string of leaks, and now, after and a steady stream of reveals focused on its increasingly proposterous character roster - where the likes of Game of Thrones&#x27; Arya Stark can battle against Scooby Doo&#x27;s Shaggy - it finally enters invite-only closed alpha later this week.


Multiversus&#x27; closed alpha runs from 19th-27th May, giving participants access to 15 playable fighters, seven maps, and a selection of different modes.

                              <span>Spacefaring sim sequel Kerbal Space Program 2 - which has faced repeated delays since its unveiling in 2019 - has been delayed yet again, and is now expected to arrive in &quot;early 2023&quot; on PC, with a console release to follow later in that year.


Kerbal Space Program 2 was first confirmed to be in development during Gamescom 2019, where it slapped with what would prove to be an extremely optimistic 2020 release date. Publisher Private Division later adjusted that to &quot;fiscal 2021&quot; - sometime between April 2020 and March 2021 - and then pushed it back once again to autumn 2021.


That still wasn&#x27;t the end of the delays, however; as 2020 drew to a close, developer Intercept Games revealed it had made the decision to postpone release yet again, this time to some nebulous point in 2022, citing the &quot;immense technical and creative challenge&quot; of developing the sequel. And now, Kerbal Space Program 2&#x27;s release has shifted once more.

                              <span>Netflix will be giving its Cyberpunk 2077 animated series a first airing - alongside glimpses of its live-action Resident Evil show and Cuphead season 2 - during its Geeked Week event in June.


Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, which was announced back in June 2020 well before Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s troubled launch, is a 10-episode collaboration between CD Projekt and Japanese animation studio Trigger, which has previously worked on Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill.


At the time of its announcement, CD Projekt said the series would follows the adventures of a street kid trying to survive in a technology- and body-modification-obsessed city of the future. &quot;Having everything to lose,&quot; went the official blurb, &quot;he chooses to stay alive by becoming an edgerunner — a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk.&quot;

                              <span>Following a controversial email last week, in which PlayStation boss Jim Ryan asked staff to &quot;respect differences of opinion&quot; on abortion rights, a new report has claimed Sony is currently refusing to approve any statements its PlayStation studios might want to make on the topic of reproductive rights in response to the US Supreme Court&#x27;s proposal to reverse the ruling of Roe v Wade, with Insomniac head Ted Price going as far as to tell staff he believed there would be &quot;material repercussions&quot; if it went against Sony&#x27;s wishes.


According to a new report by The Washington Post, Spider-Man and Ratchet &amp; Clank developer Insomniac, which was acquired by Sony in 2020, had made the decision to donate $50,000 USD to the Women&#x27;s Reproductive Rights Assistance Project (WRRAP) following the US Supreme Court&#x27;s recent proposal to reverse Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the country - a donation Sony has agreed to match, along with any additional donations from staff, as part of company&#x27;s &quot;PlayStation Cares&quot; programme.


However, according to the Washington Post, Sony won&#x27;t authorise any public statement Insomniac might want to make about reproductive rights or its donation, and staff have been expressly forbidden from mentioning either Sony or Insomniac in any retweet should the WRRAP choose to make an announcement about the donation. &quot;[Sony Interactive Entertainment] will not approve ANY statements from any studio on the topic of reproductive rights,&quot; Insomniac head Ted Price told studio employees in an email dated 13th May. &quot;We fought hard for this and we did not win.”

                              <span>Knockout battle royale game Fall Guys is going free-to-play from 21st June, developer Mediatonic has announced. Additionally, the shift in monetisation model will coincide with the game&#x27;s long-awaited release on Switch and Xbox, as well as the arrival of a new PlayStation 5 version, and its debut on the Epic Games Store.


As part of its transition to free-to-play, Fall Guys - which celebrates its second birthday later this year - will be hitting the reset button, and 21st June will see it re-launching with a new season that Mediatonic is referring to as Season 1: Free For All, promising &quot;stacks of new challenges and rewards&quot;.


As with Rocket League before it, which similarly went free-to-play after being snapped up by Epic Games, Fall Guys will be adapting a monetisation model that&#x27;ll be immediately familiar to Fortnite players. That means the arrival of a new paid premium Season Pass - purchasable with a new in-game currency known as Show-Bucks - that&#x27;ll sit alongside the existing free tier.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly developing an Xbox and PC app to let you create your own dynamic backgrounds. 


As spotted by notorious Microsoft leaker Aggiornamenti Lumia and Windows Central, the in-progress app looks like it will let you add up to eight concurrent visual effects to custom imagery. You can then layer said effects over a timeline, creating an animated background for your PC or console.


Microsoft took a little while to add dynamic backgrounds to Xbox, but there are now an array to choose from, including themes which nod back to the Xbox console family&#x27;s past, as well as to favourite franchises such as Halo.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s revamped PlayStation Plus service is now just a week away from its initial launch, and we now have some idea which games will be included as part of its current and classic game catalogues.


As a reminder, the new PlayStation Plus tiers will arrive here in the UK on 23rd June, as with elsewhere in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. This follows the service&#x27;s launch in the Americas on 13th June, Japan on 2nd June, and Asia next week on 24th May.


Included with both the new Extra and Premium tiers, the PS4 and PS5 Game Catalogue will include numerous recent PlayStation exclusives, including Returnal, Death Stranding: Director&#x27;s Cut, Demon&#x27;s Souls, Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut and Horizon Zero Dawn.

That&#x27;s a question answered by YouTube creator ZeoNyph, who&#x27;s produced a short video of a demake done using Blender software.


It&#x27;s a fun video homage, with all the hallmarks of a PS1 game.

Robocop is available to buy for 1500 V-Bucks, with accessories including a LEG-209 pickaxe (the leg of rival ED-209), as well as a little ED-209 to ride around on as a traversal remote (500 V-Bucks apiece). 


The appearance of Robocop is the first retro-era icon in a while, though Fortnite has in the past welcomed characters from Terminator, Alien, Tron, Ghostbusters and Predator. Here&#x27;s how Robocop looks, dusted off and back in action:

                              <span>Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment has laid out its upcoming slate of projects - and there&#x27;s a lot on the cards. 


Of course, there&#x27;s the upcoming long, long-awaited Alan Wake 2. Last week we glimpsed some new concept art, though were told not to expect any big reveal this summer as originally planned. Still, word of a Nintendo Switch release of the original game and a TV series in development all sounded positive.


&quot;Alan Wake 2 is in the full production stage,&quot; Remedy wrote in its latest financial results. &quot;A lot of work remains, but the game is starting to take a more complete form in many areas. As communicated earlier, Alan Wake 2 will be released in 2023.&quot;

                              <span>A new Elden Ring PC mod turns its NPC and bosses into companions.


Created by modder Satoshi98 (thanks PC Gamer), the mod turns various characters from the game into spirit ash summons.


What&#x27;s more, the range of these summons has been extended, meaning they can be summoned more frequently and in more places on the map, following the player like Skyrim&#x27;s companions.

                              <span>Twitch and Discord have issued statements following the deadly mass shooting in Buffalo, New York at the weekend, which is being investigated as a racially-motivated attack.


10 people died and three more were injured in the shooting, all but two of whom were African-American. 


The perpetrator, an 18-year-old white man, livestreamed the attack on Twitch, and planned it via a private server on Discord.

                              <span>Staff at Activision Blizzard have criticised the company&#x27;s diversity tool that was revealed over the weekend.


Known as the Diversity Space Tool, it was started in 2016 and has been in beta at mobile studio King. It&#x27;s intended to boost the diversity of characters in games, but has been criticised for belittling diversity and diminishing it to a checklist.


A blog post about the tool was shared on 12th May, but has since been heavily edited. Originally it mentioned the Overwatch 2 team was experimenting with the tool, but this has since been removed.

                              <span>Rob Joyce, the director of cybersecurity at the NSA, said so in an interview:
The NSA already has classified quantum-resistant algorithms of its own that it developed over many years, said Joyce. But it didn’t enter any of its own in the contest. The agency’s mathematicians, however, worked with NIST to support the process, trying to crack the algorithms in order to test their merit.
“Those candidate algorithms that NIST is running the competitions on all appear strong, secure, and what we need for quantum resistance,” Joyce said. “We’ve worked against all of them to make sure they are solid.”...</span>

The volume populators feature is now two releases old and entering beta! The AnyVolumeDataSouce feature
gate defaults to enabled in Kubernetes v1.24, which means that users can specify any custom resource
as the data source of a PVC.
An earlier blog article detailed how the
volume populators feature works. In short, a cluster administrator can install a CRD and
associated populator controller in the cluster, and any user who can create instances of
the CR can create pre-populated volumes by taking advantage of the populator.
Multiple populators can be installed side by side for different purposes. The SIG storage
community is already seeing some implementations in public, and more prototypes should
appear soon.
Cluster administrations are strongly encourag…</span>

                              <span>Players tempted by - but yet to purchase - Ska Studios&#x27; Salt and Sacrifice may be in for a bit of a shock today, as the price for the Soulslike 2D action game has shot up in some territories on the PlayStation Store.

Forced to match the local prices on the Epic Games Stores across the world - regardless of each country&#x27;s own economy or the fact the game has already launched - Sony&#x27;s prices have absolutely rocketed for some, with places like Brazil seeing a price hike of 276 per cent (thanks, TechRaptor).

In the UK, players will actually see a saving - the price here has dropped from £16 to £13 - and in Canada, it&#x27;s jumped a little from $22CAD to $27CAD.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns has just been age-rated in South Korea.

The age classification - deliberated on 13th May and published on Friday - suggests the tactical card-battle RPG may be coming to PC, Switch, and PlayStation and Xbox consoles sooner than expected. 

As spotted by a members of r/LeaksandRumours, the RPG has been awarded a 15 rating, the description for which explains how Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns will take on the Hydra in a game. The board cites the game&#x27;s &quot;many expressions that look like violence and blood towards living things&quot; as the reason why it was given a 15 rating.

Though not remotely confirmed - so just take this with the proverbial bucket of salt for now until we&#x27;re told anything more conclusive - journalist and podcaster Nick Baker said on the Xbox Era podcast that Microsoft&#x27;s first-party shooter franchise may be getting the &quot;Master Chief Collection-type treatment&quot;.

Conducted by Famitsu and translated by FrontlineJP (thanks, NME), the survey was completed by 1700 people, the majority of whom (1509) were male and aged 25-29. 

Almost all respondents confirmed they loved the story and world of Elden Ring, as well as exploration, the field, and boss combat. Item crafting and the upgrade system for equipment were the least favourite aspects of Elden Ring.

As first reported by Windows Central, Atlus has circulated a consumer survey to players asking a whole slew of questions about their gaming preferences. 
While not unusual in and of itself - it&#x27;s an annual survey, after all - question 38 has Persona fans cautiously optimistic that mainline entries of the franchise may finally make their way to Xbox.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s housing lottery system issues have now been fixed.

Producer and director, Naoki Yoshida, confirmed that, while &quot;extensive and persistent&quot;, the errors will  be resolved when the game goes into maintenance mode tomorrow, 16th May. 

It&#x27;s taken a full month to fix the issue, though. Back in April, Yoshida apologised to players for ongoing issues with the MMORPG&#x27;s new housing lottery system that prevented players from winning any land. Writing on the official website, he explain what the team was doing to address a problem in which players were being told their bids were unsuccessful because there &quot;were no participants in this lottery&quot;, or that the winning number was &quot;0&quot;... even though no players can be assigned that number.

That&#x27;s according to Striking Distance Studios CEO Glen Schofield, who teased yesterday that &quot;now might be a good time to start&quot; keeping an eye on updates from the studio.

Up until now, the studio has been playing its cards very close to the chest indeed, but yesterday - fittingly Friday 13th - Schofield teased on his personal Twitter account that we should &quot;look for some news next week&quot;, before dropping the wondeerfully gross image of a close-up of one of The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s creatures below.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Bohemia Interactive dropped a save the date for &quot;Future of Arma&quot;, an upcoming livestream set to reveal what&#x27;s next for the tactical military shooter.

Earlier today, however, an alleged marketing and brand guide leaked online, revealing that a new multi-platform instalment, Arma Reforger, is on the way to PC. It looks like it&#x27;s set to come to Xbox and PlayStation consoles, too, although the wording is a tad confusing, so it&#x27;s possible the PS4 and PS5 release will come &quot;in the future&quot;.

The leak intimates that the company is set to announce Arma 4 alongside Reforger, which has been called a &quot;more focused&quot; title that will &quot;introduce Arma to a new console-oriented audience&quot; with a &quot;very strong multiplayer focus&quot; that will &quot;test new technology and design decisions to form the foundation for Arma 4.&quot;

                              <span>Just weeks after confirming it was selling off its western studios and IP to Embracer Group for $300m, Square Enix has revealed plans to &quot;establish new studios&quot; and acquire others.

The news came as part of the company&#x27;s recent financial presentation, which revealed that one of Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;medium-term business strategy&quot; initiatives is to &quot;boost game development capabilities by establishing new studios, [mergers and acquisitions], etc.&quot;

As spotted by Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo (thanks, NME), the company also revealed that the &quot;objectives behind divestiture of select overseas studios and IP&quot; - that is, the reason why it sold off its three western studios - was to &quot;achieve sustained growth through selection and concentration of company sources, better align overseas publishing function with organisation in Tokyo, and transform group business portfolio&quot;.

                              <span>Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé has hinted that &quot;some developer is playing around with an idea&quot; that may bring Nintendo&#x27;s space racer F-Zero back to life.

In an interview with VentureBeat, Fils-Aimé confirmed that a developer rarely &quot;makes a conscious decision not to continue supporting&quot; a franchise, stating that - &quot;at least during [his] tenure&quot; - Nintendo is always experimenting with ways to make new games… or apply new ideas to an existing franchise. 

&quot;Why was F-Zero abandoned?&quot; he said. &quot;The insight I would share is that, at least during my tenure, Nintendo developers were always experimenting with different gameplay styles, always thinking about where a unique experience could be applied back, either to an existing franchise or maybe creating a new franchise.

That means the wholesome farming simulator has doubled its 10 million sales since January 2020, and sold five million copies since September 2021 alone.

&quot;The 20 million copies milestone is really amazing,&quot; Stardew Valley creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone said in an email to PC Gamer. &quot;I can&#x27;t believe the game has reached this level.

                              <span>It&#x27;s all go for American Truck Simulator; not only does SCS Software currently have its hands full working on its previously announced Montana and Texas expansions, the developer has also been beavering away on its major California overhaul - and phase two of that work is now available in a new update.


California was, of course, one of two states included at American Truck Simulator&#x27;s launch back in 2016 (the other being Nevada), and has been starting to show in age in recent times, particularly alongside SCS&#x27; increasingly impressive work on newer state expansions.


As such, the developer pledged a refresh for the ageing location back in 2020, with the aim of bringing it up to current mapping standards. The first phase of this rework arrived last July, making significant changes to California&#x27;s northern road network, adding (and in a few cases, removing) scenery towns, and introducing Border Protection Stations.

                              <span>If this week&#x27;s two previously announced Epic Games Store freebies somehow aren&#x27;t enough to be getting on with, Epic has also, rather unexpectedly, thrown in a third offering - taking the form of developer 34BigThings&#x27; blisteringly fast, wonderfully stylish anti-grav racer Redout.


Redout initially launched all the way back in 2016, immediately dazzling with its gorgeous, high-speed racing, and did well enough that it was followed up by no less than five expansions, introducing a host of new courses to sate those smitten with its core action.


The free Epic Store version doesn&#x27;t include all those post-launch goodies, but it does deliver 11 event types across 25 tracks and five locations, alongside a robust career mode, extensive customisation, and online multiplayer for up to 12 racers. Which, to be honest, should be more than enough to keep you amused if this is your first time in Redout&#x27;s world.

                              <span>Game grading company Wata Games is the target of a new US class action lawsuit accusing it of unfair business practices and of manipulating the retro gaming market for its own gain.


As reported by VGC, the lawsuit was filed on 10th May in the Central District of California, representing class members (estimated to be as many as 10,000 individuals) who all paid for game grading and other services by Wata. It accuses Wata of &quot;engaging in affirmative acts to manipulate the retro video game market&quot; and of &quot;engaging in unfair business practices&quot;, specifically pointing the figure at Wata president and CEO Deniz Kahn.

Kahn is accused of working with auction house Heritage Auctions co-founder Jim Halperin - a previous Wata investor and advisory board member - to manipulate the retro games market through promotional efforts and media interviews, in which the pair are said to have claimed that retro games prices would continue to rise.

                              <span>Sonic remains Sega&#x27;s biggest franchise, as the publisher releases its latest financial results.


The company has seen a significant increase in its sales over the past year (totalling 320.0bn yen), with Entertainment Contents (divided into full games and free-to-play games, as well as arcade machines, toys, and animation) contributing the most (235.9bn yen).


With 5.8m units, the Sonic franchise remains Sega&#x27;s biggest seller by a considerable margin, but Yakuza and Total War are strong.

                              <span>Fortnite looks set to dramatically upgrade its user-made creative capabilities later this year, when Epic Games releases the Unreal Editor for Fortnite. 


Speaking to Fast Company, Epic boss Tim Sweeney said the release would allow &quot;the full capabilities that you&#x27;ve seen [in Unreal Engine] opened up so that anybody can build very high-quality game content and code... and deploy it into Fortnite without having to do a deal with us - it&#x27;s open to everybody&quot;.


Fortnite already has a Creative mode where you can build your own Fortnite island or mini-game using Epic-designed props and game design options. But collaborations with brands and monetisation of content has remained controlled by Epic itself.

                              <span>Eurogamer is delighted to announce the return of its paid work experience programme for ethnic minorities, following its successful debut last year. 


The programme will once again run for two months this summer, with applications now open, exclusively to those from ethnic minorities who live in the UK. 


As we wrote last year when launching the scheme initially, the games media has a diversity problem and Eurogamer is no exception. It is on us to help affect change and continue improving representation, so that the games media better reflects the gaming community as a whole.

Starship Troopers: Terran Command is a traditional-looking real-time strategy game set in the Starship Troopers universe. As you&#x27;d expect, you take command of the mobile infantry and go to war against the Arachnid threat.


The video below shows how this plays out in the game - you generate troops, troops and more troops, who gain experience and battlefield prowess as they eradicate the enemy. The trick is keeping experienced troops alive long enough to get truly powerful. Once the last soldier in a squad is killed, that squad is toast.

                              <span>Publisher Slitherine has shown off half an hour of upcoming real-time tactics game Stargate: Timekeepers, while confirming plans to release a beta to coincide with the much-loved SG1 TV series&#x27; 25th anniversary in July.


The video, below, shows the Stargate: Timekeepers segment of Slitherine&#x27;s Home of Wargamers event. It debuts the In Plain Site mission, in which the Stargate team, including sniper Max Bolton and technical officer Sam Watson, attempt to put down a sacrifice ritual inside the Jaffa village by disguising themselves as the enemy.


The stealth heavy Stargate: Timekeepers, developed by Creative Forge Games (Hard West, Phantom Doctrine), looks heavily inspired by the Commandos series (this is not a guns blazing type of game). The campaign departs from the end of season seven of the Stargate SG-1 main plot with an original story starting during the Battle of Antarctica. It unfolds over 14 missions, each of which lasts around an hour, and revolves around unravelling a timeloop mystery and defeating the Goa&#x27;uld threat.

                              <span>The Fallen Order sequel is reportedly called Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.


That&#x27;s according to the ever chatty Jeff Grubb from VentureBeat, who confirmed a guess at the subtitle from the chat of the Grubbsnax Giant Bomb show.


You can watch the moment Grubb confirms the name in the video below (skip to 1:17).

                              <span>Angry PlayStation employees have leaked an internal email sent by company boss Jim Ryan, in which he asked staff to &quot;respect differences of opinion&quot; on abortion rights. 


The email, excerpts from which were posted by Bloomberg, landed in PlayStation employee inboxes yesterday. In it, Ryan addressed a number of subjects - including the ongoing controversy over the US Supreme Court&#x27;s proposed work to ditch the key abortion rights case Roe v Wade.


While not expressing a personal stance, Ryan did suggest staff acknowledge &quot;we owe it to each other and to PlayStation&#x27;s millions of users to respect differences of opinion among everyone in our internal and external communities.

                              <span>Square Enix has released its financial results for the past year, which have kept afloat thanks to Final Fantasy 14.


Net sales for the publisher were 365.3m yen, with 51m yen profit. Those net sales dropped almost 10 percent compared to the previous year, which saw the release of Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Marvel&#x27;s Avengers.


However, net sales in the MMO sector increased, due &quot;not only to a sharp rise in the number of monthly paying subscribers for Final Fantasy 14, but also to the release of an expansion pack for the title&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox must work to &quot;better meet expectations&quot;, boss Phil Spencer has said, reflecting on yesterday&#x27;s bombshell delay of both Starfield and Redfall. 


The shift for both Bethesda games until the first half of nextyear leaves the Xbox first-party game slate for 2022 looking decidedly bare. 


Addressing the news, Spencer said such decisions were &quot;hard on teams making the games and our fans&quot;. He continued: &quot;While I fully support giving teams time to release these great games when they are ready, we hear the feedback.

In a call for staff applications to various open roles on the project, Funcom released two pieces of artwork that give us our first sense of the vibe this new Dune game is going for.

There&#x27;s also an additional piece of art, showing a man, maker hook in hand, presumably about to pounce upon a sand worm.

With Kubernetes 1.24 the gRPC probes functionality entered beta and is available by default.
Now you can configure startup, liveness, and readiness probes for your gRPC app
without exposing any HTTP endpoint, nor do you need an executable. Kubernetes can natively connect to your your workload via gRPC and query its status.
Some history
It&#x27;s useful to let the system managing your workload check that the app is
healthy, has started OK, and whether the app considers itself good to accept
traffic. Before the gRPC support was added, Kubernetes already allowed you to
check for health based on running an executable from inside the container image,
by making an HTTP request, or by checking whether a TCP connection succeeded.
For most apps, those checks are enough.…</span>

                              <span>Way back in 2018, developer Remedy Entertainment announced it was working to adapt its beloved supernatural horror adventure Alan Wake for television - and now, some four years later, it finally has an update on the project, announcing it&#x27;s partnering with The Walking Dead network AMC to bring the show to life.


Alan Wake, for the uninitiated, debuted on Xbox 360 back in 2010, and its small-town horror, in which the titular novelist battles supernatural forces armed with little more than a flashlight and an endless urge to monologue, quickly gained cult classic status. But while all was quiet on the Alan front for over a decade, he&#x27;s had something of a resurgence in recent times.


Alongside a prominent role in Remedy&#x27;s acclaimed Control - specifically in its second DLC, known as AWE - Alan Wake was given the remaster treatment in 2021 (a release now confirmed for Switch) and will be getting a long-awaited sequel some time next year. As such, a TV series expanding Alan&#x27;s reach still further seems like the next logical step for Remedy.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been pining for the return of Ubisoft&#x27;s impressively enduring Rabbids ahead of their flagship appearance in this year&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope on Switch, you&#x27;re in luck: Ubisoft has announced it&#x27;ll be giving its previously China-exclusive game Rabbids: Adventure Party a global release at some point before the end of next month.


Rabbids: Adventure Party initially launched for Switch in 2020, sending the titular nuisances back in time for some hijinks inspired by classic Chinese novel Journey to the West - and for some minigame action played using the Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers.


There&#x27;ll be a number of notable changes for Rabbids: Adventure Party come its global release, however. For starters, according to Ubisoft&#x27;s latest earnings report, it&#x27;ll be getting a new name, becoming the slightly less catchy Rabbids: Party of Legends, and will be branching out onto other platforms in addition to Switch - namely Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Stadia.

                              <span>Dead Space fans eager to get their hands on EA Motive&#x27;s promising remake of developer Visceral Games&#x27; much-loved sci-fi horror classic now have a date to scrawl in their diaries; EA has confirmed it&#x27;ll be releasing for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 27th January next year.


Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of the 2008 original, promising to raise &quot;the level of horror and immersion to unprecedented heights&quot;. Of course, players still step into the shoes of engineer Isaac Clarke as they take their terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura - battling the nightmarish necromorphs along the way - but EA Motive&#x27;s version promises to bring enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks include improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Following the remake&#x27;s official unveiling, EA Motive has given Dead Space fans a surprisingly thorough behind-the-scenes look at its development, revealing more on its gameplay changes, audio, and art across three separate livestreams.

                              <span>Alan Wake Remastered, the spruced-up version of developer Remedy&#x27;s cult-classic action-horror, is officially launching on Switch this autumn. Additionally, the developer has offered an update on its long-awaited Alan Wake 2, saying it has made the decision to delay the larger reveal it had originally told fans to expect this summer.


Alan Wake Remastered - which bundles together the base game plus its two expansions, The Signal and The Writer - launched for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last October, giving Remedy&#x27;s much-loved original a welcome modern-day makeover with the likes of richer environmental detail and enhanced character models.


A Switch version of Alan Wake Remastered wasn&#x27;t previously been announced by Remedy, but a surprise listing pointing to a release on Nintendo&#x27;s platform was spotted on the Brazilian ratings board website last September.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re talking FIFA - or from next year, EA Sports FC. The breakup of FIFA and EA has sparked numerous headlines this week, as both sides have claimed the deal is good for them.

On EA&#x27;s part, it has said freedom from the FIFA organisation will allow it to do far more with its football game.  (It will also, of course, save the hefty sum it paid for those four letters on the front of its box.) As for FIFA, it has said its brand is the thing that matters, and it&#x27;ll be fine without EA. Indeed, to quote FIFA president Gianni Infantino, &quot;the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST&quot;. So there&#x27;s that.
But behind all the bluster, what do we think EA Sports FC will really look like in future? And does FIFA stand any chance of coming up with a rival game developed in time for next year? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan, plus resident footy fan Wesley Yin-Poole.

The second trailer focuses on Umbrella Corp as it works on the &#x27;Joy&#x27; miracle drug that cures all of humanity&#x27;s ailments... though is also infused with the T-virus.

                              <span>Accessibility options have finally been added to Deathloop on PS5 and PC, eight months after its release.


Over 30 improvements and options have been added in this latest update, including - at last! - the option to navigate menus using directional buttons instead of a cursor.


Also included are gameplay settings to customise combat difficulty and game speed, and new HUD and subtitle options, which can be found in a new accessibility category in the options menu.

                              <span>Pokémon Home, the franchise&#x27;s creature storage app for Switch and mobile phones, will soon add support for new releases Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl. 


Support for these games - which was expected, but still not yet dated - will arrive &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;, The Pokémon Company said today. 


It sounds like Arceus&#x27; story and mechanics have prompted a few workarounds to the normal Home formula - as already supported in Pokémon Sword/Shield, Let&#x27;s Go Pikachu/Eevee and Pokémon Go.

&quot;Over the last few months, we have focused on adding some of your most requested features, such as New Game + mode, FOV slider for consoles, and many co-op improvements,&quot; the developer wrote today. &quot;On top of that, in June, we will introduce the first game Chapter entitled &#x27;In the Footsteps of a Nightrunner,&#x27; filled with content and events, as well as the highly anticipated photo mode.
&quot;That being said, we need a bit more time to develop the first story DLC, which is now planned to be released in September.&quot;

The 8-bit game centres around you and your dog Data, as you navigate around PrivaCity. Your task is to get Data safely to the park, dodging cat ads and battling trolls.

                              <span>Valve has lost its bid to end the antitrust case over its Steam platform.
The original lawsuit, which we reported on in January 2021, saw Valve accused of abusing Steam&#x27;s market power to prevent price competition.
Now, Judge John C. Coughenour says it is possible that the company does use its influence to do just that.

The lawsuit, which was filed by Riot&#x27;s parent company Tencent, reads: &quot;This action seeks to stop Moonton from continuing its deliberate and sustained campaign to free ride on Riot&#x27;s highly valuable rights in the mobile video game League of Legends: Wild Rift and related content.&quot; The company goes on to call Moonton&#x27;s strategy &quot;blatant copying&quot;.
The lawsuit continues, &quot;Over the years, as Riot updated its video game, Moonton would copy it. When Riot updated the game&#x27;s promotional materials, Moonton copied them. And when Riot released a new trailer, Moonton copied it. This is a critical issue for Riot.

The company has also announced a similar delay - again, to the first half of 2023 - for Redfall. 

&quot;We&#x27;ve made the decision to delay the launches of Redfall and Starfield to the first half of 2023,&quot; Bethesda announced via Twitter today. &quot;The teams at Arkane Austin (Redfall) and Bethesda Game Studios (Starfield) have incredible ambitions for their games, and we want to ensure that you receive the best, most polished versions of them.

                              <span>Lego Brawls, a minifigure fighting game previously launched on Apple Arcade, is set to relaunch this summer on consoles. 


The Smash Bros-style fighter will arrive on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, published by Bandai Namco. 


The idea here is to battle - solo or with up to eight players (four on PlayStation) - and collect minifigures which you can then customise to create your own hero of choice. You can then take said hero and attempt to tackle the game&#x27;s global leaderboards.

&quot;Sharing common values and similar cultures, we strongly believe unifying the huge wealth of expertise across both teams will help us to deliver the best racing experiences we can for our players,&quot; Codemasters said in a tweet.

The group, part of contracted game services company Keywords Studios, were recently told they would need to begin working in BioWare&#x27;s offices full-time from this week. This sparked calls of unfairness from Keywords staff, who compared their lot to BioWare&#x27;s own staff - who are allowed a hybrid work from home option. 


Keywords workers have now been told they can continue to work from home &quot;until further notice&quot;, The Verge reported.

Romero himself describes it as &quot;a positive story of gratitude for a life in games. Code and games changed the trajectory of my life. I cover everything in detail, including lessons learned.&quot;

As spotted by Kotaku, at least two players who were streaming the game were put into jail by moderators.


It follows a lengthy blog post from game director and producer Naoki Yoshida earlier this week, stating that players caught using third-party tools would be reprimanded.

                              <span>Konami has just had its most profitable year ever, according to its latest financial reports.


The Japanese publisher had a record revenue of 299.5bn yen last financial year, an increase of almost 10 percent (9.9). Operating profit was a record 74.4bn yen.


The vast majority of that revenue came from the Digital Entertainment sector: 215bn yen. But without Metal Gear or Silent Hill, Konami has barely released any games, right?

                              <span>We already knew Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla was doing well - but it&#x27;s still doing well now, 18 months later.


New data released by Ubisoft last night as part of its annual financial results revealed Valhalla had more unique players in the past 12 months ending 31st March 2022 than it did in the four months after its hugely-successful launch. 


The stat suggests players are still picking up - and sticking with - Valhalla. Indeed, Ubisoft also said that the past year - free from a new Assassin&#x27;s Creed release - notched up nearly double the money than the year after 2018&#x27;s Odyssey arrived. That points to stronger sales of Valhalla&#x27;s DLC than Odyssey&#x27;s, too.

                              <span>Activision has announced Project Aurora, the codename for its upcoming Call of Duty mobile battle royale. 


According to a press release, the game has entered the alpha stage of development with a limited number of players testing it out, directly invited by Activision. 


&quot;The Closed Alpha is limited in size and with it we are looking to simply start to improve tuning, stress test matches, identify and fix bugs, as well as collect feedback and insights on all aspects of the game as new features come online,&quot; writes Activision in the press release.

                              <span>Valve has released patch notes for the Steam Deck&#x27;s latest update, which include the very welcome addition of game-specific performance settings.
To access this new feature, users must simply hop into their deck&#x27;s &#x27;quick access menu&#x27;, and then select the &#x27;performance&#x27; option. From here, click into &#x27;advanced view&#x27;.
When the per game settings are then toggled to the &#x27;on&#x27; option, a &quot;profile for the currently running title is created.&quot; Once you have edited the settings in this profile to your liking, they will be saved and applied automatically when you launch said game.

                              <span>A video said to showcase gameplay footage from a new Tencent-developed Need for Speed mobile game has leaked online.


Need for Speed Mobile, as per a series of job listings spotted earlier this year, currently appears to be in development at Tencent&#x27;s Timi Studio, which has also worked on the enormously popular Call of Duty Mobile and Pokémon Unite.


EA is yet to officially unveil a new Need for Speed mobile project, however, meaning the leaked footage - shared on the Need for Speed subreddit earlier today - is the first opportunity many will have had to see the game in action.

                              <span>Following a report last month that Ubisoft had attracted early takeover interest from several private equity firms, the Assassin&#x27;s Creed publisher has once again addressed the issue, saying it has &quot;everything we need to remain independent.&quot;


Ubisoft initially discussed the subject of buyouts back in February, following a round of acquisitions that saw Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, Sony buying Bungie, and Take-Two buying Zynga. Since then, however, a report from Bloomberg claimed Ubisoft had attracted preliminary interest from a number of private equity firms, although it was said the publisher had yet to enter into &quot;serious negotiations&quot; regarding such a deal.


In light of those reports, Ubisoft has once again addressed the subject of acquisitions, albeit in very much the same terms it did back in February. &quot;There&#x27;ve been a lot of talks around consolidation in the industry, and in Ubisoft in particular,&quot; company chairman Yves Guillemont said during the publisher&#x27;s latest earnings call, adding that its &quot;overall position is clear.&quot;

Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate ship battler - a spin-off from 2013 Assassin&#x27;s Creed game Black Flag - has been repeatedly delayed, though test footage leaked late last month suggested a launch was now finally on the horizon. Today, Ubisoft reconfirmed it would indeed see the light of day this financial year (before 1st April 2023). 


Also up this year, finally, is Ubisoft&#x27;s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Developed by The Division studio Massive Entertainment, it was first announced more than five years ago.

                              <span>Remember last week when we reported on the video showing one The Last of Us Part 2 fan trying to rewrite the game&#x27;s narrative using mods? Well, they have done it again, and this time discovered the zebra that Abby and her father take care of in Salt Lake City is actually invincible (for which I am quite relieved - this game has enough bloodshed as it is).
In the second episode of Speclizer&#x27;s myth busting series, the creator used a series of gunshots and explosives to see if the zebra would meet its demise. However, that lady is a hardy one, and if anything, she only looks mildly disgruntled as the bomb blasts go off around her (which, you know, seems fair).
Another amusing discovery comes from the snowy streets of Jackson. This time, it is Ellie in the control seat, and she is pissed at the community&#x27;s annoying kids for trying to best her in a snowball fight. However, no matter how far Ellie goes from that play area, she will still be hit over and over again by the white stuff. In the words of Speclizer, &quot;the kids have aimbot&quot;.

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t long ago that developer Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s confirmed its free-to-play battle royale shooter Apex Legends would finally be making its debut on mobile devices this May - and now the developer has gone one better, confirming it&#x27;ll be heading to iOS and Android next Tuesday, 17th May.


Apex Legends&#x27; move to mobile was made official last April, when Respawn confirmed it would be a completely separate entity to its console and PC counterparts, meaning players should expect unique battle passes, even mobile-only maps and gameplay - although no cross-play. It also promises to tailor the experience specifically for mobile devices with the likes of streamlined controls for touchscreens.


Apex Legends Mobile has been available to select players for some time now, having entered regional testing earlier this year, but Respawn has now confirmed its ready to roll out the experience globally, with its full iOS and Android launch now set for next Tuesday, 17th May.

                              <span>Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, has made the leap to Switch and will be available via the console&#x27;s eShop from today, 11th May.


As you might have already twigged, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club&#x27;s celebrated underground railway builder Mini Metro, and delivers an equally minimalist, equally excellent, spin on its predecessor&#x27;s tactile strategy action.


In Mini Motorways, each level takes loose inspiration from a real-world city, and the goal is to construct as efficient a road network as possible, placing down the likes of traffic lights, bridges, and roads to ensure commuters are able to reach their destination within the allotted time. New building items are awarded each in-game week, enabling your urban expansion to continue unfettered - until you make a mistake and your best laid plans end in chaos.

What we did get was a look at more than a dozen promising indie titles headed to Nintendo Switch over the next year, some of which were new reveals, while others popped up with new release windows. Oh, and a couple are out today!


The showcase kicked off with creature collection and farming game Ooblets, which is getting a Nintendo Switch release this summer. It previously launched via Early Access on PC and Xbox.

It&#x27;s being developed as a collaboration between Deadpan Games&#x27; Will Lewis (maker of Steam and Switch roguelike Caveblazers) and artist Gaziter.

Speaking to The New York Times, EA boss Andrew Wilson said a lot of the company&#x27;s motivation was to improve players&#x27; experiences without being pigeonholed.
&quot;It was really about how can we do more for the players, more for the fans, how can we offer them more modalities to play,&quot; he said. &quot;How can we bring more partners into the game, how can we expand beyond the bounds of the traditional game.&quot;

                              <span>EA has released it financial report for the year, highlighting the ongoing growth of its live-service games. The company specifically drew attention to Apex Legends, revealing it has now surpassed $2bn in lifetime net bookings.
&quot;Our healthy live services growth was driven by strength across our broad-based portfolio, mostly notably by Apex Legends and FIFA,&quot; said EA exec Chris Suh.
&quot;Apex Legends is up over 40 percent for the year, taking it past the $2bn milestone in lifetime net bookings.&quot;

                              <span>BioWare has swiftly shut down internet speculation it had inadvertantly teased a return for franchise hero Commander Shepard in the next Mass Effect.


Yesterday, fan gossip was sparked by the description of a poster on the BioWare store. The poster is a print of the teaser image BioWare released last November for its in-development Mass Effect game, and was described thus: &quot;While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what&#x27;s next.&quot;


This description (which was later corrected to remove Shepard&#x27;s name) was enough to spark YouTube videos, as well as articles from various blogs and websites. And, of course, the fire was only fuelled further by BioWare&#x27;s later correction.

                              <span>Capcom has had yet another great year of sales, and as such made some pretty tidy profits. 
The company released its financial report earlier today and announced its &quot;fifth consecutive year of record-high profits&quot;, although this is actually its ninth consecutive year of seeing some kind of profit growth. Capcom stated these profits have been driven by its digital contents business (so, hey there Resident Evil and Monster Hunter).
&quot;Net sales were 110bn yen (up 15.5 percent from the previous fiscal year), operating income was 42bn yen (up 24 percent), ordinary income was 44bn yen (up 27.2 percent), and net income attributable to owners of the parent was 32,553m yen (up 30.6 percent),&quot; Capcom said.

The other three mystery titles include a &quot;remake&quot;, a &quot;sports title, and a &quot;partner title&quot; - likely meaning one of the various studios EA publishes games for, such as It Takes Two&#x27;s Hazelight.


Alongside those, EA also has its upcoming (and final) FIFA game and Madden NFL 23 set for this autumn, before NHL 23 and the long-awaited Need for Speed turn up before Christmas. So, what could those mystery games be?

De Waubert was previously managing director of Ubisoft Paris and will now report directly to CEO Yves Guillemot and lead all Ubisoft studios worldwide.

&quot;I will refrain from making comments on the competitors&#x27; strategy,&quot; PlayStation exec Hiroki Totoki told investors during the company&#x27;s latest financial call). &quot;Our current thinking is to have development costs [and] appropriate R&amp;D investment for quality products, and that will improve the platform and also improve the business in the long run.
&quot;AAA type titles on PS5, if we distribute that on the subscription services, we may need to shrink the investment needed for that and that will deteriorate the first-party title quality and that is our concern.&quot;

Speaking to investors last night, EA boss Andrew Wilson said the publisher was taking &quot;the long view&quot; when it came to the franchise, and that it would remain a big part of EA for the forseeable future.


Wilson praised former Respawn boss Vince Zampella in his new expanded role in which he also oversees some Battlefield development, and also promised EA would continue to &quot;grow&quot; Battlefield 2042 - after righting its ship first.

The new figure was revealed in publisher Bandai Namco&#x27;s earnings report that takes us up to the end of March, meaning global sales will have exceeded that 13.4m.

                              <span>Four different pathways to deprecation that AWS has trod over the past few years. Some approaches are more customer- or partner-friendly than others, while others are painfully slow or silently abrupt.

                              <span>Georgetown has a new report on the highly secretive bulk surveillance activities of ICE in the US:
When you think about government surveillance in the United States, you likely think of the National Security Agency or the FBI. You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don’t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has — without any judicial, legislative or public oversight — reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</span>

                              <span>Following EA&#x27;s announcement that it will be ditching the FIFA brand and renaming its long-running football series EA Sports FC starting in 2023, FIFA President Gianni Infantino has responded, insisting, &quot;the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans.&quot;


That comes alongside FIFA&#x27;s announcement it&#x27;ll be adopting a non-exclusive licensing model for games based on its brand moving forward, and that it&#x27;s currently working with third-party studios and publishers to developer new projects. This, it says, will enable it to provide &quot;more choice for football and gaming fans in the lead-up to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Australia &amp; New Zealand 2023.&quot;


Now that its partnership with EA is officially over, FIFA says it&#x27;s already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024. Before that, however, it&#x27;ll be launching a number of &quot;non-simulation games&quot; with the initial selection due to release in the third quarter of this year.

                              <span>Grounded, developer Obsidian&#x27;s inch-high garden survival adventure, has just dropped another update on the road to its Version 1.0 release later this year, introducing what sounds like a sort of on-demand horde mode for players wishing to farm and battle particular enemies.


As explained in a new developer video, the idea behind Grounded&#x27;s Bugs Strike Back update is to introduce - in &quot;true Obsidian fashion&quot; - Faction Reactivity. Essentially, the more players bother specific bug types in their quest for new materials - whether that be by killing them outright or merely invading their territory - the more likely those creatures will be to storm player bases to try and exact revenge.


While that&#x27;ll happen automatically during play, those looking for a more on-demand-style experience can take advantage of two additional features. There&#x27;s the new Waft Emitter device that enables players to summon specific bug types to a location for some wave-based mayhem by jamming in parts stolen from their downed brethren. The more parts used, the more intense the ensuing battle will be so players are recommended to proceed cautiously.

                              <span>Almost four year to the day that Microsoft formally unveiled its well-recieved Xbox Adaptive Controller, the company has announced a new range of accessibility focused accessories intended to provide a &quot;highly adaptable, easy-to-use&quot; ecosystem for those that have difficulty using a traditional mouse and keyboard.


Designed in partnership with the disability community, the new adaptive accessories consist of three main components - an Adaptive Mouse, Adaptive Buttons, and an Adaptive Hub - with the idea being that users can augment the first two devices with 3D printed accessories in order to customise mouse and keyboard inputs in a way that best suits their needs.


The new Adaptive Mouse, for instance, can be customised with a thumb support and tail extension - or 3D printed tails - as required, while the Adaptive Hub serves as a means of either replacing or augmenting a traditional keyboard.

Beginning in 2023, FIFA&#x27;s new name will be EA Sports FC - though expect the game to remain otherwise unchanged, with the same wide array of club and player licenses, as well as all the usual game modes. 


The widely-expected move was confirmed today via press release, shortly before EA&#x27;s annual financial briefing.

Malenia is one of the game&#x27;s most brutal bosses, but a player named Let Me Solo Her stepped in as a summon to assist those in need.


Now, later tonight, they will stream their 1000th Malenia kill live: check it out on their &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDUpJh1Ek3plo34sGriwe-w

Online functionality for both games will cease on 30th June, meaning no more access to online matches or community-made content.


WWE 2K19, released in 2018, was the final game from long-time series stalwart Yuke&#x27;s. WWE 2K20, released in 2019, was the disastrous follow-up solely made by Visual Concepts, previously the series&#x27; co-developer.

We reported in 2020 that PS3 players appeared to trigger the secret cutscene by disarming all nukes in the game&#x27;s asynchronous online multiplayer mode. 


As it turns out - thanks to a new video from Did You Know Gaming - players didn&#x27;t actually meet the requirement of zero nukes. Why? It&#x27;s impossible.

Previous reveals have confirmed the likes of a new, more challenging Master Rank, new monsters, a new area in the form of The Citadel - which promises diverse biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece - and a new hub area in the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost.


That, though, isn&#x27;t the end of the additions arriving in Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s &quot;massive&quot; Sunbreak expansion. As part of its latest reveal, Capcom has showcased three new monsters and discussed Sunbreak&#x27;s flagship addition, Malzeno, in more detail.

                              <span>Sony has today launched new system updates for the aging PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, apparently in a bid to enhance their security. 


Two-factor authentication is now required when signing-in, and certain account features have been disabled (thanks, PushSquare). 


It is now no longer possible to create a new PlayStation account on either console, for example, instead leaving this to Sony&#x27;s more secure website accessible via PC or mobile.

                              <span>After, let&#x27;s be honest, a pretty long wait, Ubisoft has announced that The Division 2 will be getting a brand-new season.
The launch of season nine, which is known as Hidden Alliance will go live on 12th May and will add a new big bad to the game: Captain Lewis. As well as this hulking brute, there will also be four new mini bosses for players to square up against, or Lewis&#x27; &quot;True sons&quot; as Ubisoft calls them. 
This update will also introduce a new eight-player co-op mode called Countdown. As the name suggests, here players making up two teams will be given a 15-minute countdown to stabilize a power plant before it&#x27;s locked down for good. The teams will be starting in different locations on the map and must work together to be victorious on their mission (so, you know, no pressure). You can check out the full season reveal below.

                              <span>An Elden Ring player has spent three hours hiding in a bush in order to thwart a rune farmer.


To explain, AFK rune farming has become a bit of an issue in the game. In order to easily get runes, some players have opened their game to invaders but hidden away in an inaccessible spot. When the invaders either die or leave the game in frustration, the host receives runes.


However, when Reddit user Teasnarker came upon a rune farmer, they decided to take revenge by trolling the troll.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has cancelled the planned PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Gotham Knights.
The news - which came alongside a first-look at gameplay showing Nightwing and Red Hood - means Gotham Knights will now launch on 25th October just for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Warner Bros. did not go into detail on its decision to drop last-gen consoles, or explain when this decision was made. By way of explanation, it simply said the move was &quot;to provide players with the best possible gameplay experience&quot;.

                              <span>Warner Bros and DC have revealed new gameplay footage for two of Gotham Knights&#x27; heroes, Nightwing and Red Hood. 


&quot;The new video debuts an extended look at both playable characters as they bring justice to Gotham City&#x27;s criminal element, while also investigating clues around the mysterious Court of Owls,&quot; the Gotham Knights team states. 


&quot;In this gameplay walkthrough, each hero&#x27;s distinct fighting style and open-world traversal abilities are on full display, from Nightwing&#x27;s unique acrobatic combat and aerial glider to Red Hood&#x27;s twin firearm skills and powerful leaping capability.&quot; You can check out the new footage for yourself below.

&quot;The all-new #MilesMoralesPS5-inspired statue from Premium Collectibles Studio is huge! Here&#x27;s a @NajJeter for scale,&quot; the developer tweeted yesterday.


As you may have surmised, the tweet was accompanied by a photo of Miles Morales actor Nadji Jeter sitting beside his action figure.

Documents obtained by GameSpot reveal Brandon Despotakis, or BlazeFN as they are known online, violated the Fortnite end user license agreement and its terms of service, and infringed Epic&#x27;s copyright by unlawfully selling in-game accounts and cheats to other Fortnite players. 


These included &quot;aimbots, limited-time &#x27;Full Access V-Bucks accounts&#x27; and &#x27;inactive&#x27; accounts that included rare or popular skins and pre-completed battle passes, among other illegal offerings&quot;.

&quot;To me, I see the Metaverse as &#x27;a system that replaces reality with a virtual world.&#x27; So I don&#x27;t think the Metaverse has anything in common with entertainment,&quot; he said.

                              <span>VR is amazing, for sure. It adds a whole other level of immersion to your gameplay and as a result will enhance the overall experience. However, a group of scientists has taken this winning formula and now boosted it even further. How have they done this? Simply by letting your face and mouth also become part of the VR experience. And how have they chosen to demonstrate this new tech? Well - with, er, spiders.


Before we go on, let me quickly assure you that when I say spiders, I do not mean real spiders. Rather, just some small VR arachnids. So, once more to clarify, no real spiders (or people for that matter) were harmed in the making of this article. 


Anyway, back to the matter in hand.  A group of scientists from Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Future Interfaces Group (via PC Gamer) have taken a standard Oculus Quest 2, and decked it out with a series of ultrasonic transducers.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s critically-acclaimed Nintendo Switch adventure Metroid Dread looks to have become the series&#x27; best-selling game.


The original Metroid Prime on GameCube had previously been the series&#x27; biggest seller, which Dread has now dethroned. 


Metroid Dread has now shifted 2.9m copies worldwide since its launch in October last year. Metroid Prime was previously reported to have sold 2.8m.

                              <span>Nintendo has shifted another 23m Switch consoles in the past financial year (ending 31st March), for a new lifetime total of 107.65m units.


But while that&#x27;s a huge milestone - already 6m more than the Wii - Nintendo admitted its consoles sales were down 20 percent on last year, and blamed &quot;shortages of semiconductor components and other parts&quot;. Last year&#x27;s results were also boosted by the breakout popularity of Animal Crossing, Nintendo noted.


Nintendo Switch game sales saw no such slowdown. Software sales were up 1.8 percent year-on-year to 235m, meaning the past 12 months were the highest annual game sales figure ever recorded for a Nintendo platform.

                              <span>Ahead of Call of Duty developer Raven Software&#x27;s vote on whether to form a legally binding union, Activision Blizzard has sent out anti-unionisation emails to its staff.


In a report by The Washington Post, employees revealed Raven management held several meetings and town halls ahead of the workforce&#x27;s upcoming vote to unionise. During one such town hall, held on 26th April, Raven management reportedly inferred that any unionisation within the company would &quot;impede game development and affect promotions and benefits&quot;. Following this meeting, employees then received an email with an attachment that simply read &quot;Please vote no&quot;.


However, these emails do not appear to have had the desired affect for AKB, as many employees still went on to vote &#x27;Yes&#x27; on their ballot cards.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki Yoshida has said third-party tools are not to be used with the MMORPG.


Square Enix released a full statement yesterday, noting &quot;the use of third-party tools is strictly prohibited&quot;. However, the team intends to &quot;review the most prominent tools, and in order to discourage their use, endeavour to enhance the functionality of the HUD&quot;.


The news follows the completion of the notoriously difficult Dragonsong&#x27;s Reprise raid added in the latest patch. Team Neverland was the first to complete the raid and Square Enix shared a video of the win, before swiftly taking it down due to a copyright request.

However, those figures are lower than expected - by 3.3m consoles - following warnings by Sony it was struggling to get hold of components. 


Sony had hoped to shift 14.8m PS5 consoles this past financial year (the 12 months ending 31st March 2022) in order to match - if not outpace - the number of PS4s sold at the same point in its lifecycle.

Flight Simulator&#x27;s Top Gun expansion was announced last June as part of the Xbox and Bethesday Showcase. It was initially due to launch last November along the upcoming Top Gun: Maverick movie but was delayed when Paramount Pictures made the decision to postpone the film&#x27;s release into this year.
Asobo has yet to fully detail what Flight Simulator players can expect from its free Top Gun expansion, but we do know it&#x27;ll include the F-18 among other things, and aims to give players first-hand experience of &quot;what it&#x27;s like to be a US Navy Top Gun&quot;.

                              <span>David Ward, co-founder of renowned game developer and publisher Ocean Software, has died at the age of 75.


Ward founded Ocean with Jon Woods in 1983, and the Manchester-based company - initially known as Spectrum Games - would go on to become one of the era&#x27;s biggest publishers.


Its extensive output spanned the 80s and early 90s, with a focus on arcade conversions and licensed games, including the likes of 1984&#x27;s legendary Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon, and home computer versions of Batman, RoboCop, and the Addams Family.

                              <span>Publisher Wales Interactive has given a fresh airing to Sker Ritual - its co-op survival shooter follow-up to 2020&#x27;s horror outing Maid of Sker - sharing new details and a first proper trailer.


The original Maid of Sker took its cue from Welsh folklore - retelling the supposedly true tale of Elizabeth Williams, said to have have died of a broken heart after being locked inside her home by her controlling father - and spun it into an richly atmospheric, if ultimately rather unadventurous slice of 19th stealth horror.


Follow-up Sker Ritual is quite a departure, however, switching out the methodical sneaking of its predecessor in favour of co-operative FPS action for up to four players as they try and &quot;survive the onslaught and supernatural menace of the Quiet Ones&quot;.

                              <span>EA Motive is readying to show more of its remake of Visceral Games&#x27; much-love sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and will be shining a light (a small one obviously, so as not to ruin the gloomy ambience) on the game&#x27;s art in a new livestream set to air this Thursday, 12th May.


This will be EA Motive&#x27;s third developer livestream since the Dead Space remake&#x27;s official unveiling last July, with the developer&#x27;s first showing having focused on enhancements being made to the original&#x27;s moody environments, zero-g traversal, and dismemberment and damage systems. Its second showcase, meanwhile, was all about audio.


EA&#x27;s calling this third livestream Crafting the Tension, and promises a &quot;deep dive into various aspects of the upcoming game’s art design&quot;. Specifically, it&#x27;ll be talking about how it&#x27;s using the power of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and modern PC hardware to &quot;visually evolve and remake the original Dead Space&#x27;s environments, characters, VFX, lighting and more from the ground up to create a new level of immersion and quality&quot; for today’s audiences.

                              <span>Summer Games Done Quick returns with more charity speedruning attempts this June - with an in-person event to go with its online component for the first time in two years - and organisers have now revealed the full schedule, meaning you can begin planning your viewing now.


This year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick serves up a week of speedrunning fun from Sunday, 26th June to 3rd July, and will feature more than 120 speedruns over its run-time, with all money raised during the show going to Doctors Without Borders.


As ever, this year&#x27;s schedule is a pleasingly diverse thing, featuring retro classics, indie favourites, triple-A blockbusters, and a couple of oddities thrown in for good measure. The mighty Elden Ring is in there - perhaps inevitably given its speedrunning allure - and a further browse of the list reveals everything from Phasmophobia and Yakuza: Like a Dragon to Halo Infinite and McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure, all serving up various flavours of speedrun.

Behaviour Interactive has a livestream planned for the 17th May where new content for the game will be revealed.


However, as posted up on Reddit, some of that content has allegedly leaked early. Spoilers follow.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s decision not to bring cult classic Mother 3 to the west was purely &quot;business&quot;, former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has said. 


The latest comment on the matter - and the latest interview with Fils-Aimé as he promotes his new memoir - comes from Bloomberg, where the former exec stated for the first time that Mother 3&#x27;s content was not the issue.


&quot;That is not at all the issue why Mother 3 in particular never made it to the West,&quot; Fils-Aime said when asked about Mother 3&#x27;s more sensitive topics. &quot;It was all based on the business needs and the business situation at the time.&quot;

Well, that&#x27;s what happened to the developers of Final Fantasy 16, when Bloodborne was first released. They pretty much had the exact same idea themselves, they say, but their game was cancelled before we got to hear about it. 

Writing in Japanese magazine Famitsu, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida detailed what could have been (via ResetEra). 

Yoshida and fellow Final Fantasy team members Hiroshi Takai and Hiroshi Minagawa reminisced about their previous game that was &quot;basically Bloodborne&quot;, but before Bloodborne was even a thing.

                              <span>The PC servers for the Dark Souls games have now been offline for over 100 days.


Back in January, we reported a security issue with the online multiplayer functionality of FromSoftware&#x27;s Souls games that would allow invaders to run code on someone else&#x27;s PC without permission.


Publisher Bandai Namco shut down the servers, meaning PC players are unable to play the games online - a key part of the experience through invasions, summoning, and messages.

                              <span>Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse (which manages all of miHoYo&#x27;s global operations outside of China) has teased its upcoming game, Zenless Zone Zero.
The game&#x27;s site is now live and shows a digital clock perched atop a retro TV. Meanwhile, off to one side, there is a calendar couting down to 13th May. More interestingly (and also more strangely), the dials on the TV can actually be twiddled by clicking on them and, when done so, one of two videos will start playing.
The first video is mostly static with a few blurry and erratic shots thrown in here and there. Throughout, an unknown man chats a lot about &quot;Doomsday&quot; and states, &quot;in short, we&#x27;re being reborn... and you&#x27;re involved.&quot; If that doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to you right now, don&#x27;t worry. It doesn&#x27;t to us either.

As reported by Reuters, the change comes as part of a crackdown on the booming games sector.


The National Radio and Television Administration said in a statement that livestreaming platforms need to step up controls for underage users (under 18).

Officially, we&#x27;ve heard nothing about Re:Verse now for nearly a year, since its second delay last July. Once intended to arrive alondside Village in May 2021, it now holds a vague &quot;2022&quot; release date. 


However, a new PEGI rating for a Stadia version of the game popped up over the weekend, suggesting Capcom was back prepping the game for launch (thanks, Gematsu).

                              <span>Activision has revealed its Call of Duty mobile game is doing just as well as its PC and console games are, with the mobile title having now reached an impressive 650m downloads.
In the company&#x27;s recent annual report (via CharlieIntel), Activision wrote: &quot;We continued to demonstrate the potential for our console and PC franchises on mobile. Call of Duty Mobile enjoyed a record year following its launch in China, with annual consumer spending on the title of well above $1bn.
&quot;Over 650 million people have downloaded Call of Duty Mobile around the world, and the number of people experiencing Call of Duty on mobile each month almost matched those playing on console and PC in 2021. This is no mean feat given the success of the free-to-play Warzone experience on console and PC.&quot;

                              <span>The New York Times has decided to remove today&#x27;s intended Wordle answer, in case players thought its appearance was an attempt by the newspaper to reference a &quot;major recent news event&quot;. 


We&#x27;ll mention the word itself below.


However, the New York Times is unable to affect Wordle&#x27;s list of upcoming answers (all pre-programmed into the game months in advance) if you do not refresh your browser window. This means some players will still see the removed word today.

                              <span>When you think of Left 4 Dead, in general the image of a zombie comes to mind. However, if Gabe Newell had his way, this may not be the case, as the Valve president initially felt zombies were a bit cliché and &quot;cheesy&quot;. 
Former Valve writer Chet Faliszek chatted about his time at the company with YouTube channel Kiwi Talkz (via VG247). Here, the writer revealed during the development of Left 4 Dead he, &quot;went to dinner with Gabe and [Newell] was like &#x27;if you look at zombie movies, Night Of The Living Dead is about racism, Dawn Of The Dead is about consumerism&#x27;&quot;.
When the Newell then asked Faliszek to explain &quot;what his game was about&quot;, the writer replied: &quot;well it&#x27;s about working together, it&#x27;s the game itself, it&#x27;s a reflection of the game.&quot;

Essentially, players can watch specific Twitch streams to earn exclusive items to be used in-game. However, fans were frustrated and posted negative reviews for the game on Steam.


&quot;In order to get these items... you have to watch hours and hours of inane Twitch streamers prattling on instead of actually playing the game you paid for. They also are timed so if you miss them you miss them forever,&quot; wrote one review. &quot;If there was another way to earn these in-game it would not be a big deal but I&#x27;m not gonna watch ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Angry Joe for two hours just to get a weapon.&quot;

In a lengthy tweet from the League of Legends player, he explains the difficulties of coming out in the hostile world of esports and calls for change.


&quot;I&#x27;m not making this announcement because I owe everyone the details of my personal life, but because I want there to be more awareness about the problems our community faces,&quot; he wrote.

                              <span>Xbox has been criticised for several periods of server downtime over the weekend, which left some players unable to boot games they own. 


The Xbox Support Twitter account reported issues impacting the ability to launch Xbox games and play games via the Xbox Cloud on the evening of Friday 6th May, and then again on Saturday morning, and once more on Saturday night (UK times).


The outages have sparked a wave of complaints on social media, including from streamer and Xbox presenter Parris Lilly, who has called for greater transparency from Microsoft on how its digital rights management (DRM) policies work.

                              <span>Apple Mail now blocks email trackers by default.
Most email newsletters you get include an invisible “image,” typically a single white pixel, with a unique file name. The server keeps track of every time this “image” is opened and by which IP address. This quirk of internet history means that marketers can track exactly when you open an email and your IP address, which can be used to roughly work out your location.
So, how does Apple Mail stop this? By caching. Apple Mail downloads all images for all emails before you open them. Practically speaking, that means every message downloaded to Apple Mail is marked “read,” regardless of whether you open it. Apples also routes the download through two different proxies, meaning your precise location also can’t be tracked...</span>

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly set to launch an Xbox cloud gaming streaming device in the next 12 months.

According to VentureBeat, this may be a stick or puck similar to Amazon and Roku devices, although there are also reports that an app for Samsung smart TVs is on the way, too, which is also expected to launch in the next year or so.

If true, it means players will not only be able to stream games to their PC and mobile devices, but also play them on TVs, all without the added expense of buying consoles or their expensive accessories.

                              <span>Ron Gilbert has responded to fans unhappy with Return to Monkey Island&#x27;s art style, stating &quot;Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style you wanted or were expecting but it&#x27;s the art style I wanted&quot;.

In a candid blog post, Gilbert said the game had &quot;a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it’s beautiful to see, play, and listen to&quot;.

As Victoria so perfectly summarised for us earlier this week, the Monkey Island series has taken on a new look as well as a new creative team in its third outing, The Curse of Monkey Island. However, this new art style was not simply because of the change in management behind the game&#x27;s development but because of the tools being used behind the scenes, and not all fans are happy with the new look.

That&#x27;s according to an eagle-eyed fan on Reddit (thanks, PCGN) who spotted that the PSN Store&#x27;s listing of the game has been updated to state it supports &quot;four network players&quot;.

Acutely aware that anyone can knock up a fake screenshot, I took the liberty of checking the PSN Store listing myself and yup, it&#x27;s there in black and white, although the description itself curiously still says you can play &quot;in solo-play or with one other hero and drop in on criminal activity wherever you find it&quot;.

                              <span>Babylon&#x27;s Fall, Platinum Games&#x27; action RPG, saw its concurrent PC player count drop to just a single player on PC on Wednesday, 4th May, 2022.

It&#x27;s yet another sign that the troubled game - which only released at the beginning of March - seemingly continues to struggle to maintain a player base on PC (Babylon&#x27;s Fall is also out on PS4/5, but there&#x27;s no similar way for us to monitor player counts for PlayStation consoles).

Just a couple of weeks back, we reported how SteamCharts - a site that, predictably enough, charts the performance of games on Steam - noted that in mid-April, global players on PC dropped below ten. Fast forward to May, and it looks as though like things are getting worse, with concurrent PC players failing to top 100 at all this week (thanks, VGC). Its highest ever peak sits at just 1166 players.

                              <span>Lost Ark&#x27;s first Legion Raid, Valtan, is set to release in the western version of the game now developer Smilegate believes &quot;enough of [its] player base has reached the item level needed to participate&quot;.

In an update on the game&#x27;s official blog, the team confirmed that the &quot;difficult team-based activities&quot; will require an item level of 1415 for normal difficulty, and 1445 for hard mode and will release later this month. 

&quot;Valtan will introduce the first Legion Raid into the western version of Lost Ark. Legion Raids are difficult team-based activities that require teamwork to understand and execute the strategy necessary to counter each Legion Commander&#x27;s unique characteristics, abilities, and mechanics,&quot; the team said.

                              <span>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has fined Nvidia $5.5m USD for failing to properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on revenue the company earned from the sale of its gaming GPUs - a failure the SEC says &quot;deprived investors of critical information [needed] to evaluate the company’s business in a key market&quot;.


Announcing the results of its investigation, which specifically relates to Nvidia&#x27;s actions during its fiscal year 2018, the SEC claimed that while the tech company had reported material growth in revenue within its gaming business at the time, it had failed to reveal to investors that - based on its own information - its gaming sales were driven in significant part by cryptomining.


Why&#x27;s that important? As the SEC puts it, &quot;These significant earnings and cash flow fluctuations related to a volatile business for investors to ascertain the likelihood that past performance was indicative of future performance.&quot;

                              <span>Despite having already cancelled one attempt at turning EVE Online into an FPS, developer CCP&#x27;s enthusiasm for the project apparently remains strong: it&#x27;s now confirmed that, two years after Project Nova officially got the chop, work on a new FPS continues at its London Studio.


EVE Online FPS Project Nova was initially unveiled in 2016 as a spiritual successor to CCP&#x27;s long-defunct free-to-play PS3 shooter Dust 514. Almost two years went by with ne&#x27;er a peep on the project, but then October 2018 finally brought a more extensive reveal. Unexpectedly, though, just a month later, CCP announced its intention to &quot;return to the drawing board&quot; with Project Nova, and 18 months after that, the game was officially no more.


Despite that rollercoaster ride, CCP said it remained committed to releasing an EVE Online FPS and that work on a new sci-fi shooter, with expanded scope, would continue at its London studio. That was more than two years ago, though, leading many to assume that the project had also run its a course.

                              <span>Following comments last week that Final Fantasy 16 was in the &quot;final stages&quot; of development, producer Naoki Yoshida has offered a further progress update, confirming, among other things, that a new trailer for the long-awaited JRPG is expected to release soon.


Previously, Yoshida had told Uniqlo&#x27;s UT magazine - where he was featured to promote a new Final Fantasy t-shirt line - that Final Fantasy 16 was &quot;in the final stages of development&quot; and that the team hoped to deliver a &quot;comprehensive&quot; experience &quot;full of story and gameplay&quot;.


In new comments made during a Nier Reincarnation and Final Fantasy 14 crossover livestream, as translated by Twitch streamer Audrey (thanks Polygon), Yoshida joked to interviewer and Nier producer Yosuke Saito that Square Enix&#x27;s American PR team &quot;got mad&quot; at him following the Uniqlo comments. Undeterred though, Yoshida was willing to speak a little further on Final Fantasy 16&#x27;s progress, saying the game is &quot;greatly coming together&quot; but that he wants the development team to spend more time on polishing the experience.

In addition to this news, Witch Beam artist Tim Dawson shared some more information about the real-life origins behind some in-game items on the PlayStation blog.
&quot;People often describe the game as feeling very personal, and we think it is, but personal can mean different things,&quot; Dawson wrote.

The footage in question was shot in downtown Calgary and shows Military forces moving through the city&#x27;s streets.
As the trucks make their way through, red flares go off from the nearby buildings and celebratory gunfire can be seen and heard. The extras making up the crowds on these streets appear to be shouting &quot;Freedom!&quot; and &quot;Fuck FEDRA!&quot;.

That is, until now! Mexican indie developer Luto Akino has been putting together his own version of what a possible Metroid 64 may have looked like.


Akino has shared a video of his work on Twitter, which shows a wonderfully polygonal Samus Arun exploring some caves (spotted by Kotaku).

The report comes from developer People Can Fly (via Tweak Tower). Here, the company revealed the game is yet to make its publisher (Square Enix) any revenue. This was something that was suspected in August last year, when the developer said Square Enix was yet to pay it a royalty fee.
But, even in the several months following that initial statement, no royalty fee ended up coming People Can Fly&#x27;s way in 2021.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has opened a probe into Sony&#x27;s recent acquisition of Bungie. 
In January, Sony announced its plans to buy Destiny maker Bungie for a tidy $3.6bn. And, as has become the norm for deals such as this, the FTC has opened an in-depth investigation into this takeover. 
According to sources (via The Information), this investigation may set the closing date of this deal back by six months, if not more. While we were never given a firm date of when Sony had hoped to have this deal all squared away by on its initial announcement, reports now state that any closure will be happening early next year.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing Square Enix&#x27;s surprise sale of its western studios - Guardians of the Galaxy developer Eidos Montreal and Marvel&#x27;s Avengers maker Crystal Dynamics - and what this might mean. 


Will a leaner, more focused Square Enix now itself be sold to an interested party (*cough* PlayStation)? Is this actually good news for mothballed series such as Deus Ex? And on a related note, we talk about the latest rumblings of a Ubisoft acquisition - and whether we think the Assassin&#x27;s Creed creator is the next big games industry acquisition.


Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

                              <span>Nintendo has released an extended look at gameplay from the upcoming Mario Strikers Battle League, the next entry in the Mushroom Kingdom-based football series. 
For now, the trailer has only been released in Japanese, but it&#x27;s still fairly clear what&#x27;s going on. Characters shown off include Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, Rosalina, Toad, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario and Waluigi.
Mario Strikers Battle League was announced a couple of months back with a launch date set for Nintendo Switch on 10th June, though we&#x27;ve heard little about it since. Once again, series stalwart Next Level Games (of Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 3 fame) is on development duties.

                              <span>Pokémon Unite may be getting a new game mode, according to dataminers.


Prolific data miner ElChicoEevee has unearthed files that point to playable wild Pokémon, suggesting a new mode may be on the way to capture and control them.


That includes legendary Pokémon like Zapdos, Articuno, and Regigigas.

To put those numbers into a different perspective, that is over 30 percent of Activision&#x27;s entire workforce (which, is roughly 9800), and close to half of its total developers (6800).
&quot;We are working on the most ambitious plan in Call of Duty history, with over 3000 people now working on the franchise and a return to the Modern Warfare setting that delivered our most successful Call of Duty title ever,&quot; Activision wrote in its 2021 annual report (via Tweak Town).

                              <span>The infamous, one-of-a-kind golden Wii meant for the Queen has been put up for auction.


This unique promotional console was crafted by THQ back in 2009 as a stunt to launch a mediocre minigame collection. The publisher famously tried to send the console to the Queen - though it never reached royal hands. 


Now, the console - arguably, a piece of gaming history - has been listed on auction site Goldin. As of the time of writing, the bidding stands at £2k.

Head creative Joseph Staten acknowledged fan feedback on Twitter: &quot;Hey Spartans, this week has been bumpy. That definitely wasn&#x27;t our goal.

Then, in January, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra released a blog post laying out the steps he said will &quot;rebuild trust&quot; in the developer. This included plans to hire new team members, whose roles would focus on improving the company&#x27;s workplace culture. 
Following the arrival of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s new chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer Kristen Hines last month, Blizzard has welcomed Jessica Martinez as its &quot;first Vice President, Head of Culture.&quot;
Martinez&#x27;s arrival will mark &quot;part of [Blizzard&#x27;s] ongoing initiative to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace culture where people at every level can learn, grow and bring their most creative selves to their work,&quot; Blizzard says.

It’s not an international treaty, but it does impose obligations on the signatories. It’s a major milestone for global Internet security and safety.

The v1.24 release of Kubernetes brings storage capacity
tracking as a generally available feature.
Problems we have solved
As explained in more detail in the previous blog post about this
feature, storage capacity
tracking allows a CSI driver to publish information about remaining
capacity. The kube-scheduler then uses that information to pick suitable nodes
for a Pod when that Pod has volumes that still need to be provisioned.
Without this information, a Pod may get stuck without ever being scheduled onto
a suitable node because kube-scheduler has to choose blindly and always ends up
picking a node for which the volume cannot be provisioned because the
underlying storage system managed by the CSI driver does not have sufficient
capacity left.
Because CSI driv…</span>

TennoCon has, of course, traditionally been a live, in-person event combining Warframe announcements, developer panels, and various community focused activities, but Digital Extremes made the decision to go online-only back in 2020 in reponse to the coronavirus pandemic, meaning this year&#x27;s TennoCon will be its third fully digital show.


Unfortunately, beyond that 16th July date, Digital Extremes is yet to share much in the ways of details about this year&#x27;s TennoCon, only saying that the all-day event will feature &quot;exciting reveals&quot; from the team, alongside a community art show.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re starting to tire of splicing up the same old animals into DNA hybrid monstrosities in park management sim Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, there&#x27;s some potentially exciting news on the horizon: you&#x27;ll soon be able to fancy up your adorably terrifying creations into something even more exotic when the game&#x27;s newly announced Dinosaur Island DLC arrives on 23rd May.


Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, takes the familiar framework of classic zoo tycoons as its starting point, tasking players with importing and breeding animals, managing staff, and fashioning an appealing park using scenery items, shops, and amenities in order to keep guests happy and the money rolling in.


It offers two main twists on that familiar formula, however; there&#x27;s a morality system - giving players the choice between keeping everything above board or taking a more exploitative path - plus the aforementioned DNA splicing angle, enabling players to create and exhibit the likes of crocoducks, giraffephants, and chickow.

                              <span>Fans of quality freebies (so basically everyone then, I assume) are in for a treat next week as Prey and Jotunn join the lengthening list of games to be given away on the Epic Store.


Prey, of course, is yet another winner from Arkane Studios, the developer behind the critically acclaimed likes of Dishonored and Deathloop. As with those series, Prey, which released back in 2017, falls squarely in the immersive sim genre, this time taking the studios&#x27; focus on open-ended traversal and player choice into outer space.


Here, players take on the role of Morgan Yu and, after a memorably orchestrated opening sequence, find themselves onboard the space station Talos I somewhere in the year 2032. It&#x27;s a gorgeously luxuriant setting - Eurogamer called it &quot;perhaps the grandest and most beautiful facility of its kind ever imagined for a game&quot; in its Recommended review - but all is not right.

                              <span>Following the news that Haden Blackman, studio head and founder of Mafia 3&#x27;s developer Hangar 13, is stepping down from the role after seven years, a new report has claimed a fourth instalment in the Mafia series is currently in early development at the studio.
That&#x27;s according to Kotaku, which reports that newly appointed studio boss Nick Baynes is leading development on a brand-new Mafia game, codenamed Nero. The project is said to be a prequel to the Mafia trilogy - which would suggest a return to the prohibition era action of the very first Mafia game, if not even earlier.
Additionally, Hangar 13 will reportedly be ditching its Mafia 3 engine - used in the recent Mafia 1 remake - in favour of Unreal Engine 5. It may, however, be some time before either the studio or publisher 2K Games is ready to talk about the title, given it&#x27;s still &quot;early in development&quot;.

As with any Xbox Cloud Gaming title, you&#x27;ll need an Xbox account to log-in - but you won&#x27;t need membership to any subscription, such as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

                              <span>All sorts of strange things come out of Reddit.

A post on the r/gaming subreddit appeared to show a test-build copy of Star Wars: Battlefront 3 for PSP, which belongs to poster&#x27;s fiancé. 


&quot;LucasArts was a client of a relative of my Fiancé back in the day, and he got to play test a lot of games, one of which was Star Wars: Battlefront 3, once it was cancelled, and all the assets were being gathered up to send back to Skywalker Ranch, one of the play test cartages for the PSP version got left behind. Him being young, he didn&#x27;t think much of it and took it home, tested it out, AI battles, CTF, and Conquest all worked fine,&quot; the user wrote.

Summer Game Fest is, of course, the Keighley-fronted rival (and now semi-successor) to the usual array of E3 press conferences which typically broadcast each summer. There&#x27;s no actual E3 this year, as you&#x27;ll recall.


Announcing the festivities, Keighley promised a &quot;live cross-industry showcase&quot; with game announcements, reveals, and the indie-focused Day of the Devs.

Tickets for Pokémon Go Fest: Berlin have also now gone on sale - including the usual Early Access option as well as some new and pricey extras which pop up as you complete your purchase. 


For example, you can pay an extra €10 for the Raid Lover bolt-on, which gives you 12 in-person raid passes and some extra items and XP rewards. You can also pay an extra €10 for the Critical Hatch! bolt-on, which grants you 1/4 egg hatching distance, plus extra XP and other bonuses for hatching eggs.

                              <span>As many know already, the Monkey Island series took on a new look as well as a new creative team in its third outing, The Curse of Monkey Island. However, this new art style was not simply because of the change in management behind the game&#x27;s development. Rather, it was because of the tools being used behind the scenes.
&quot;A new art path had to be developed for Curse of Monkey Island,&quot; game designer Jonathan Ackley revealed on Twitter.
&quot;2D games of the time scanned drawings straight to raster, causing heavy aliasing. We used US Animation. It vectorised the line art before compositing and colour/resolution reduction, creating smoother art,&quot; he explained.

IO Interactive has published an update on its Hitman 3 - Year 2 content, following an announcement at the start of the year.

The Freelancer mode will see Agent 47 off on a series of roguelike missions from a customisable safehouse, but IO has stated it needs more time. The offering will now be released in the second half of 2022, instead of this spring.

With the arrival of Halo Infinite&#x27;s Season 2, Clippy makes a return in the form of a legendary-tier weapon charm, although it&#x27;s currently unclear how players can unlock it, as it&#x27;s not available on the Battle Pass or earned in-game. 


Xbox hardware senior project manager James Shields showed off Clippy and the associated nameplate the &quot;Clipster&quot; in a tweet.

However, all is not well on Isle Delfino, as fans have noticed thr track&#x27;s cars before the final turn are now static. 


The dissatisfaction amongst some fans became obvious when Nintendo tweeted a promotional clip of Coconut Mall (thanks, Nintendo Life).

                              <span>Yuke&#x27;s, the Japanese developer behind two decades of popular WWE games, has announced it is returning to the wrestling genre with new project AEW Fight Forever.


There&#x27;s no word yet on a release date or platforms (beyond a vague promise of PC and consoles), but today&#x27;s announcement and first look at development will likely be welcomed by fans who have missed Yuke&#x27;s work over the past few years. 


Yuke&#x27;s final WWE game was 2018&#x27;s WWE 2K19, before publisher 2K Sports gave Yuke&#x27;s the boot and chose US outfit Visual Concepts to take control of the series instead - with decidedly poor results (so much so that WWE 2K21 was cancelled altogether).

The stats system in Elden Ring can be a little complex, balancing character stats, spell schools, and weapon types to work out how much damage you&#x27;re actually doing.


Now, though, there&#x27;s a tool to do the maths for you. Praise the calculator!

                              <span>A Rockstar Games artist has taken some of the most iconic games of today and given them a retro comic book inspired makeover. 
Mark Scicluna, who worked as a senior illustrator and graphic designer on Red Dead Redemption 2, LA Noire Remastered and Bully Anniversary Edition, has created some amazing retro illustrations of other games outside of Rockstar (via GoombaStomp). These include everything from Metal Gear Solid to Crash Bandicoot.
Taking inspiration from the likes of DC comics of old, these illustrations immediately evoke memories of a time since passed, but with a modern twist. My personal favourite is Dino Crisis – just look at the teeth on that triceratops!

Recent details suggested Ubisoft was being circled by several private equity firms, and Ubisoft itself has addressed the possibility it will be bought during a recent investor briefing. 
Now, mergers and acquisitions site Dealreporter (via SeekingAlpha) has suggested Ubisoft&#x27;s founding Guillemot family is looking to partner with one of these private equity firms while retaining  control of the company - a move designed to see off a full-scale takeover attempt by another party.

For the unfamiliar, Heardle is basically guess the intro: second by second you&#x27;re given an extra chance to guess the song and share the result online in pretty coloured squares.


Apply that to the music of Square Enix&#x27;s critically acclaimed MMORPG and you have Final Fantasy 14 Heardle.

That&#x27;s according to the latest report from Streamlabs, which states that all platforms have seen a decline in growth in comparison to this time last year.


The Covid-19 pandemic is the main cause of both the rise and fall of streaming numbers. With more people working from home and spending less time on outdoor leisure activities, streaming viewership increased; now the world is opening up again, those numbers are declining.

                              <span>Yesterday we reported that Dying Light&#x27;s Hellraider DLC was getting its final update. However, despite what was first assumed (by me at least), this is not the end of Techland&#x27;s plans for its Zombie platformer. Rather, the company has announced a brand new Dieselpunk DLC, which is available from today (5th May).
&quot;Go Back in Time with the New Dieselpunk DLC, discover historical Volkan Machines equipment crafted for world-class soldiers, and enjoy their unique design in Harran,&quot; the developer teased. This DLC comes with new gear, most notably a chainsaw known as the &#x27;Gut Render&#x27; and a serrated sword known as the &#x27;Flesh Ripper&#x27;. With these two weapons in your armoury, you will soon be slicing and dicing your way through those zombie hoards in a breeze.
If you prefer to be less up close and personal with your prey, perhaps the &#x27;Greaser&#x27; firearm will be more your thing. In the words of Techland, this gun is the &quot;new definition of swiss cheese&quot;. Of course, you could always just barrel through the advancing enemies with your new wheels, aka the &#x27;Rugged Roadster&#x27;. Check out the blood-soaked trailer for this new DLC below.

While this isn’t the largest application-layer attack we’ve seen, it is the largest we’ve seen over HTTPS. HTTPS DDoS attacks are more expensive in terms of required computational resources because of the higher cost of establishing a secure TLS encrypted connection. Therefore it costs the attacker more to launch the attack, and for the victim to mitigate it. We’ve seen very large attacks in the past over (unencrypted) HTTP, but this attack stands out because of the resources it required at its scale...</span>

Volume expansion was introduced as a alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.8 and it went beta in 1.11 and with Kubernetes 1.24 we are excited to announce general availability(GA)
of volume expansion.
This feature allows Kubernetes users to simply edit their PersistentVolumeClaim objects and specify new size in PVC Spec and Kubernetes will automatically expand the volume
using storage backend and also expand the underlying file system in-use by the Pod without requiring any downtime at all if possible.
How to use volume expansion
You can trigger expansion for a PersistentVolume by editing the spec field of a PVC, specifying a different
(and larger) storage request. For example, given following PVC:
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: myclaim

                              <span>Today, 4th May, is Star Wars Day and Microsoft is celebrating the annual ode to George Lucas&#x27; iconic sci-fi odyssey by giving away 12 custom Xbox Series S consoles inspired by developer Traveller&#x27;s Tales&#x27; recently released Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.


Each of the 12 custom consoles features a unique colour scheme and design inspired by a different Lego-ised Star Wars character from across the nine Skywalker Saga movies. BB-8 is represented by an orange and grey Xbox Series S, for instance, while Boba Fett opts for orange and green, and Darth Vadar goes all-in on the black.


The full list of characters emblazoned on the custom consoles is as follows: BB-8, Boba Fett, Chewbacca, Darth Maul, Darth Vader, Finn, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, Rey, Stormtrooper, and Yoda. Additionally, all 12 custom consoles feature controller designs that match their chosen character-themed colour schemes.

                              <span>A new lawsuit filed by New York City Employees&#x27; Retirement System has alleged Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick fast-tracked a takeover bid from Microsoft in order to escape liability for wrongdoing following a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming he&#x27;d known about sexual misconduct at the Call of Duty publisher &quot;for years&quot;.


Activision Blizzard has faced a relentless stream of shocking allegations relating to its workplace culture since last July, when a State of California lawsuit filing called the publisher &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;. Building on that lawsuit, the Wall Street Journal published a report in November claiming Bobby Kotick had been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company &quot;for years&quot;, but had failed to act on them or tell the board of directors and executives everything he knew.


It&#x27;s these claims relating to Kotick&#x27;s behaviour that form the backbone of a new lawsuit filed by the New York City Employees&#x27; Retirement System and pension funds, which owns Activision shares. The filing (as spotted by Axios) aims to secure documentation Activision has reportedly so far refused to release so that the plaintiff can carry out an investigation into the board’s &quot;failure to maintain a safe and non- discriminatory working environment for its (specifically minority and female) employees, and failure to take action in response to repeated, grave allegations of misconduct, discrimination, and harassment by Activision’s senior executives.&quot;

                              <span>Following a bit of a bumpy start to 2022 for The Sims 4 - thanks to the frustratingly buggy launch of My Wedding Stories - EA has teased a look ahead at the next few months of expansion releases, including what appears to be the long-awaited return of playable werewolves.


According to a newly shared content roadmap, The Sims 4 will receive three new expansions of varying sizes over the next two months. EA is gathering all three together under the banner Seize the Night, and all are connected by a loose nocturnal theme.


At the smaller end of the scale are two new Kit packs, currently being teased under the names Chic Nights Out and Cozy Nights In, which perhaps points to a new selection of nightlife clothing in the first expansion and comfy new furnishings in the latter.

The choir performed a series of songs that together tell the story of Rapture, the iconic underwater city from the first entry in the game series.


The likes of Andrew Ryan, Brigid Tenenbaum, and Sander Cohen all feature, singing classics like Proud Mary - the lyrics switched to &quot;rolling underwater&quot;, of course.

                              <span>New data shows that the free-to-play Breath of the Wild-like Genshin Impact has surpassed $3bn in player spending worldwide for its mobile versions. Not a bad sum for a game that only released in September 2020. This basically means that Genshin Impact makes roughly $1bn every six months. 
These impressive figures come from Sensor Tower, with the company saying: &quot;Following its worldwide release, the title took 171 days to generate its first $1bn on mobile, not including spending through third-party Android stores. 
&quot;It then took an extra 195 days to accumulate a further $1bn - resulting in the title picking up $2bn in its first year alone. Genshin Impact crossed the $3bn milestone 185 days later, meaning the game has averaged revenue of $1bn every six months, making it one of the most successful mobile games of all time.&quot;

Available via Steam for less than £2, it adapts familiar Resi weaponary and health items and tasks you with healing up and restocking a hero over various levels. 
Think of it as a window into Resi 4&#x27;s safe rooms, translated into 40 puzzle scenarios of escalating difficulty, where Leon might pause for a few minutes to snort some herbs and shuffle around his guns to squeeze in a few more shotgun shells.

Writing in his newly-published Disrupting the Game memoir, Fils-Aimé said he was surprised to hear of plans for Game Boy Micro relatively late in its development, and despite Nintendo having moved on to focus on Game Boy Advance&#x27;s successor, Nintendo DS.


In a section of the book posted online by VGC, Fils-Aimé also said he disliked the Micro&#x27;s form factor. Overall, it was a &quot;distraction&quot;, he concluded - something which he later moved to ensure became a &quot;teachable moment&quot; and not repeated.

                              <span>It has been a week for the &quot;last of its kind&quot; stories. Sony unveiled its last set of games for PlayStation Now subscribers, but developer Techland has additionally revealed its last ever update for Dying Light&#x27;s Hellraid.
This free update for the game&#x27;s dark fantasy inspired DLC will go live on 5th May and brings with it a variety of bug fixes and quality of life improvements. These all sound very nice, with balancing tweaks and economy changes across the board, but let&#x27;s talk about the true star of the show - Hellraid&#x27;s new (and only) firearm. Or, to give it its proper name, the Deathbringer shotgun.
A far cry from its fellow axes and swords of old, this shotgun is obtained by completing the Loaded for the Undead bounty (thanks, RPS) and certainly packs a powerful punch. Those pesky skeletons do not stand a chance, and will soon crumble into a bony pile of, well, bones thanks to the Deathbringer. I won&#x27;t lie, it all looks very satisfying indeed - see for yourself below.

Speaking on the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vMuUGOXtX_U&quot;&gt;Kinda Funny podcast as part of a press tour for his new memoir Disrupting the Game, Fils-Aimé was asked about Nintendo franchises he was looking forward to - before Mother 3 was inevitably brought up in conversation.


&quot;How long did it take until Earthbound and the Mother franchise came up? Don&#x27;t hold your breath,&quot; Fils-Aimé - who departed Nintendo three years ago - said. &quot;Again, I&#x27;m not there, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on.&quot;

                              <span>We all love Mario Kart; it is a classic that has evolved and grown up with us and will surely continue to dominate various sales charts for many years to come. However, what if someone took this tied and tested formula, but then added in some of the classic 20th Television characters in place of Mario and co.? Well, we now have the answer. You would get Warped Kart Racers, Apple Arcade&#x27;s upcoming karting game.
In Warped Kart Racers, players will be able to control one of 20 characters, including Hank from King of the Hill, Stan from American Dad! and Stewie from Family Guy to name but a few. In addition to these familiar faces, players will also recognise some familiar locales, as the maps that we could all soon be charging round are inspired by locations from &quot;fan-favourite episodes&quot;.
Keen karters will be able to take to the tracks in either Warped Kart Racers&#x27; single player campaign or take part in a chaotic 8-player multiplayer mode. In addition to this, you will also be able to take on daily challenges to unlock new characters, skins, karts and other customisation options. You can check out the trailer for Warped Kart Racers below.

Nintendo has added a filter to prevent obvious rude words, but many players are finding creative ways to circumvent the filter.


Players on Reddit want Nintendo to amend the naming filter, or add a method of reporting inappropriate content.

                              <span>Former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has distanced himself from recent reports concerning contract workers at the company, and said the issues raised were not representative of his time in charge. 

Last month, a Nintendo of America staff member filed an official complaint concerning alleged company interference in unionisation efforts - though Nintendo itself later responded to say the employee had been fired for disclosure of confidential information.
 Still, in the last two weeks, IGN and Kotaku have both published comments from various current and former contract workers at Nintendo, with criticism raised for how the company differentiates between full-time and contract staff in terms of pay, benefits and a feeling of inclusion, and claims it lacked a solid progression path to becoming a permanent employee.

Then, in its official statement, Bungie called the leaked draft decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade a &quot;direct attack on human rights&quot;.

                              <span>On a longer planning horizon than many companies seem to operate, it would appear that the approach that most of the existing cloud providers are taking today is suboptimal. Their messaging, their product offerings, their enhancements around existing services, and their hiring all swirls around a central theme: migrating enterprise workloads into cloud.

                              <span>Mandiant is reporting on a new botnet.
The group, which security firm Mandiant is calling UNC3524, has spent the past 18 months burrowing into victims’ networks with unusual stealth. In cases where the group is ejected, it wastes no time reinfecting the victim environment and picking up where things left off. There are many keys to its stealth, including:
The use of a unique backdoor Mandiant calls Quietexit, which runs on load balancers, wireless access point controllers, and other types of IoT devices that don’t support antivirus or endpoint detection. This makes detection through traditional means difficult.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has written to shareholders urging them to vote against against a New York State proposal that it should publish an annual report detailing the effectiveness and outcomes of its efforts to prevent abuse, harassment, and discrimination in its workplace. Similarly, it also wants shareholders to vote against a proposal to put an employee representative on its board.


As detailed in its latest shareholder filing, Activision Blizzard&#x27;s board of directors is unanimously recommending shareholders vote against enacting the annual report, which would include several proposed metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company&#x27;s progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.


While this kind of proposed transparency might seem prudent given that Activision Blizzard has been rocked by shocking allegations around its workplace practices since last July, and remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last year&#x27;s State of California filing, which described the publisher as a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - its board says it believes the proposal isn&#x27;t &quot;in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft has revealed the development of its troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake - which was originally due to release in January last year - has been moved a new studio and will now release &quot;when it&#x27;s ready&quot;.


Prior to today&#x27;s announced, the Sands of Time remake was being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai, but the project has been dogged by setbacks since its unveiling in September 2020. Shortly after its announcement, Ubisoft moved its launch date from January 2021 to March that same year, but February brought a second delay, this time indefinitely, while the team worked on delivering &quot;a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original&quot;.


A subsequent update in June last year gave the Prince of Persia remake a revised launch window of 2022, and it&#x27;s all been pretty quiet since then.

                              <span>Furi, the now six-year-old psychedelic boss rush extravaganza from developer The Game Bakers, is poised to receive a new lease of life later this month on 17th May with the arrival of its newly announced Onnamusha DLC.


Furi - which The Game Bakers has previously described as a &quot;love letter to Japanese action games such as No More Heroes, Metal Gear Solid and Godhand&quot; - first released on PC in 2016, pitting its protagonist The Stranger against 12 incredibly stylish bosses. Each encounter played out very different - each boss requiring entirely new strategies to defeat - but it&#x27;s all built around the game&#x27;s streamlined one-on-one &quot;dash-and-slash&quot; action.


Onnamusha, then, aims to freshen up Furi&#x27;s six-year-old core by giving players a brand-new protagonist that can be used throughout the existing Story, Speedrun and Practice modes.

Building on the acclaimed racing action of its 2016 predecessor, Redout 2 features 36 new tracks (plus mirror variants of each) which can be experienced in its 12-player online races or single-player career campaign - which promises &quot;hundreds&quot; of events from a variety of different modes, including the likes of Arena Races, Time Attacks, Last Man Standing, and Boss Races.


Elsewhere, the original game&#x27;s extensive customisation options return, with players now able to start with one of 12 distinct chassis and then built on that from a selection of rocket engines, propulsors, stabilsers, rudders, magnets, intercoolers, flaps, wings, and spoilers.

                              <span>Back in February, Activision Blizzard revealed its long-running Warcraft franchise would be heading to mobile some time this year - and we now know exactly what form it&#x27;ll arrive in thanks to the company&#x27;s official reveal of free-to-play &quot;tower offence&quot; game Warcraft Arclight Rumble.


Arclight Rumble is being pitched as a combination of strategy game and tower defense, that sees players choosing from one of several leaders across five factions - Alliance, Horde, Beast, Blackrock, and Undead - each with their own abilities and specialisations.


Objectives vary depending on the chosen map (of which Blizzard is promising 70+ at launch), and these can range from skirmishes to boss battles. Players will need to deploy their units from their available &quot;minis&quot; - 60 collectible minis are being touted - and more powerful units can be deployed by gathering gold as a match plays out.

                              <span>Netflix has released a new trailer for its upcoming kids shows, giving us a new look at Sonic Prime.
I will cut to the chase, however. Yes, we do have some new footage of the spiked blue one roaring onto the screen as he collects up his golden rings, quipping, &quot;I know what you&#x27;re thinking - I&#x27;m goooood. And powerful, apparently. Jealous?!&quot;, but... well that is really all we get to see. On the other hand, it is nice to know that Sonic hasn&#x27;t been given the boot following Netflix&#x27;s recent animation purge, so every cloud. 
You can check out the footage for yourself below (PSA: unless you want to see what other kids shows are coming - some of which do certainly look like they are a lot of fun - skip forward to 1.49 to see Sonic&#x27;s bit).

                              <span>EA has announced plans for a cross-play test to be held within FIFA 22 for all players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Stadia. 


The test will be limited to the game&#x27;s Online Seasons and Online Friendlies mode, and let you play together with a friend or against rivals, regardless of their console.


An image shared by EA as part of today&#x27;s announcement showed a simple button prompt on the game&#x27;s main menu to opt out of the cross-play test, if you so choose. Cross-play will also become an option in the game&#x27;s matchmaking settings.

                              <span>Nintendo cult classic Mother 3 still hasn&#x27;t reached the west, and now its producer has been asked why. 


Discussing the long-requested threequel with former Nintendo Treehouse employees Kit and Krysta on their new podcast (thanks, Nintendo Life), producer Shinichi Kameoka was asked directly why Mother 3 had never seen the light of day outside of Japan.


&quot;Personally, I think the biggest selling point of Mother 3 is [creator] Shigesatao Itoi&#x27;s unique writing style,&quot; Kameoka replied, &quot;translating the charm and nuances of his writing into other languages is quite a challenge, and maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s taken so long to consider international releases of Mother 3.&quot;

Modders drs32 and XeIerate have teamed up to create a Darth Vader mod that replaces the confessor armour, available on Nexus Mods.

Financial details for the two companies have been made public as part of Square Enix&#x27;s sale. The Final Fantasy publisher is offloading both for just $300m - a figure which seems miniscule compared to other recent games industry mergers and acquisitions.


&quot;We firmly believe that the studios will excel under Embracer&#x27;s operating model and ownership,&quot; Embracer wrote in a note to press, adding that the studios would continue to &quot;breakeven&quot; for the &quot;the upcoming two financial years driven mainly by sales of the back-catalogue titles&quot;.

                              <span>Last month, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier tweeted that Blizzard was coming out of its &quot;dry spell&quot; and was set to release &quot;a bunch of new games&quot;, with an accompanying link to tonight&#x27;s mobile Warcraft announcement. Here, Schreier stated that this particular game was &quot;one of two&quot; mobile Warcraft projects in development. 
Schreier then went into more detail about these games on ResetEra, saying: &quot;Yup there are (at least) two Warcraft mobile games in development. One Pokémon Go, one other Clash-ish one. Heard good things about both.&quot;
However, it has now been confirmed that the Pokémon Go-like Warcraft game has in fact been cancelled.

                              <span>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger believes the global chip shortage will continue into 2024.


Speaking to CNBC, Gelsinger said the shortage could continue due to constrained availability of key manufacturing tools.


&quot;That&#x27;s part of the reason that we believe the overall semiconductor shortage will now drift into 2024, from our earlier estimates in 2023, just because the shortages have now hit equipment and some of those factory ramps will be more challenged,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Last week, Nintendo issued a warning for parents, asking them to ensure that their children always stand far enough away from the TV screen to avoid hitting it, and far enough away from others to avoid any unintentional fisticuffs. 
But alas, even after this warning, and the Wii-era experiences predating this time in our lives, it turns out that many still need to be reminded about the Joy-Cons handy little wrist straps, and why they are actually there. Specifically, when taking part in Nintendo&#x27;s latest offering: Switch Sports.
Nintendo Switch Sports came out several days ago, and in that time, many have been streaming their own exploits in the fitness themed world it provides. However, while these streams have given many a small taster of the sports that they too could try if they decide to purchase the game, they have also given us a peak into the lives of some Nintendo rebels, who choose to forgo safety warnings.

                              <span>Elden Ring has now been played with a Fisher Price controller.


New Zealand streamer Rudeism (aka Dylan Beck) is known for his controller tinkering and, after a jokey Twitter post from Wario 64, took on the challenge of modifying the kids controller.




Over two weeks, he modified the Fisher Price controller into a working Xbox controller and showed off his creation with a spot of Elden Ring.

Microsoft&#x27;s main Perfect Dark studio, The Initiative, confirmed yesterday that its co-development agreement remained in place with Crystal - despite the latter changing hands.


On Monday, Square Enix announced it was selling off its western development studios - including Crystal Dynamics, Guardians of the Galaxy studio Eidos Montreal, as well as Square Enix Montreal - and IPs including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief and Legacy of Kain for just $300m.

                              <span>Researchers are using the reflection of the smartphone in the pupils of faces taken as selfies to infer information about how the phone is being used:
For now, the research is focusing on six different ways a user can hold a device like a smartphone: with both hands, just the left, or just the right in portrait mode, and the same options in horizontal mode.

It’s not a lot of information, but it’s a start. (It’ll be a while before we can reproduce these results from Blade Runner.)

Major Themes
Dockershim Removed from kubelet
After its deprecation in v1.20, the dockershim component has been removed from the kubelet in Kubernetes v1.24.
From v1.24 onwards, you will need to either use one of the other supported runtimes (such as containerd or CRI-O)
or use cri-dockerd if you are relying on Docker Engine as your container runtime.

Dockershim has been removed as of Kubernetes v1.24, and this is a positive move for the project. However, context is important for fully understanding something, be it socially or in software development, and this deserves a more in-depth review. Alongside the dockershim removal in Kubernetes v1.24, we’ve seen some confusion (sometimes at a panic level) and dissatisfaction with this decision in the community, largely due to a lack of context around this removal. The decision to deprecate and eventually remove dockershim from Kubernetes was not made quickly or lightly. Still, it’s been in the works for so long that many of today’s users are newer than that decision, and certainly newer than the choices that led to the dockershim being necessary in the first place.

                              <span>Square Enix has sold off its western studios and over 50 intellectual properties to Embracer Group for just $300m.


The sale, which is set to go through by September this year, means Embracer owns Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal, as well as IPs including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief and Legacy of Kain. That amounts to around 1100 employees.


As already announced, a new Tomb Raider is in development at Crystal Dynamics, built on Unreal Engine 5. Thoughts now turn to other games potentially in development at these just-bought studios.

                              <span>Two leaked screenshots, reportedly of the next Forza Motorsport game, have popped up online.

Posted to r/gamingleaksandrumours over the weekend, the images - reportedly taken in July 2021 - have been deemed authentic by the subreddit&#x27;s moderating team.

If true, this means the new racing instalment will be coming to Xbox One as well as Xbox Series X and PC (thanks, Dualshockers).

                              <span>Techland has opened up about what players can expect from Dying Light 2&#x27;s upcoming story-driven DLC packs.

In an interview with wccftech, Dying Light 2 lead designer Tymon Smektała has confirmed the first &quot;runs parallel to the main story&quot;.

&quot;It can be started right after Aiden arrives in The City. Since it’s the first one out the gate, we didn’t want to force players to finish the game before they’d be able to have fun with it,&quot; Smektała said. &quot;I went through some of the speculations our community has expressed online, but I haven’t seen any of those theories get it right. So I hope that we’ll positively surprise people with this DLC.&quot;

                              <span>Dead Cells co-developer Evil Empire has opened up about new accessibility options coming to the fan-favourite indie.
It includes details about new features such as auto-hit, continue, and assist modes, all of which aim to boost accessibility. 

While the team believes &quot;part of the fun&quot; is Dead Cells&#x27; &quot;tough but fair experience&quot;, Evil Empire says it knows &quot;that it can be complicated for some people&quot;.

YouTuber Jamie Moran was even able to play it on their Xbox Series X and share the footage, stating on Twitter: &quot;The First Forza Horizon game popped up again in the store. Such a fun game, it still holds up really well and it’s 4K on Series X &amp; One X.&quot;

The game&#x27;s sudden and unexpected reappearance six years after it was removed from sale has some fans speculating that it may be making a return. Without official word from the developer or Microsoft, however, we can only chalk this up to a mistake for now.

The latest game in the series, Forza Horizon 5, has seen more than 10 million players since launch. The impressive milestone means Playground&#x27;s racing game has enjoyed the biggest first week in Xbox and Game Pass history.

Forza Horizon 5 looked like a hit even before it came out, when nearly one million people were already playing via early access on PC and Xbox ahead of the 9th November street date.

The original Forza Horizon game was briefly available to buy from the Xbox store yesterday.

While there&#x27;s no official word on whether or not the game&#x27;s return to the Xbox store was intentional, the racer has already been removed again, albeit not quite before some gamers managed to buy and download it (thanks, VGC).

The news comes via art director Lisette Titre-Montgomery, who revealed the sequel&#x27;s success in a series of tweets she posted whilst confirming she&#x27;s now left the studio. 

&quot;April Fools Day was my last day at Double Fine. I have learned so much over the past four years+ about who I am as a leader and what it means to be a creative visionary,&quot; she said in a recent tweet. &quot;Thank you for trusting me to bring the world of Psychonauts 2 to life.&quot;

                              <span>If you caught the rumour earlier this week that developers could prevent their games being downloaded on Steam Deck, worry not; turns out it was just an error.
A tweet showed purported evidence that the recently-released Demon Gaze Extra had been specifically configured to prevent downloads to Steam Deck, which understandably worried early adopters of Valve&#x27;s new handheld system.

Turns out it&#x27;s just a big misunderstanding, something Valve now suggests was &quot;accidental&quot;. It&#x27;s also promised to &quot;fix the issue&quot; with any other games that similarly prohibit Steam Deck installations.

                              <span>Players rushing to get into Call of Duty Warzone Season 3 have seemingly contributed to Virgin Media O2&#x27;s &quot;biggest gaming traffic spike on record&quot;.

Call of Duty Warzone Season 3 released at 5pm on Wednesday 27th April - albeit a day earlier for Vanguard players - and the rush of players downloading and jumping into the new season has purportedly resulted in internet provider Virgin Media&#x27;s busiest day of the year thus far - and its second-busiest since records began.

According to our sister site VGC, the average Virgin Media customer downloaded 12.1GB of data between 4pm and midnight on 27th April - that&#x27;s up 29 per cent on the preceding week - whilst the busiest period of 8-10pm saw an uptick in data consumption, 11.9 per cent higher than usual and 23.8 per cent higher than the week before.

                              <span>An update on the Microsoft store intimates that Battlefield 2042 and FIFA 22 may be on the way to Xbox Game Pass.

Whilst not formally confirmed by Microsoft nor Electronic Arts - so treat this as a rumour for now - both games now sport the Game Pass logo (thanks, XGP, via NME) on the former&#x27;s online store, suggesting they may get their debut on Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service next month. 

As FIFA 22 was released in October 2021 and Battlefield 2042 in November, this means both games will only be around six months old should they indeed be joining Microsoft&#x27;s library of games soon.

                              <span>The Long Dark&#x27;s very first paid DLC is coming &quot;later this year&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to a new developer diary in which Hinterland Studio reflects on the last eight years of development, as well as teasing what may be coming next, including a premium season pass to ensure the game &quot;continues to be financially self-sustaining&quot;.

After focussing for so long on the sandbox and story modes, the team says it&#x27;s now ready to &quot;decouple&quot; them, mitigating issues that founder Raphael van Lierop says made development &quot;unwieldy&quot; at times.

The Striking Distance Studios&#x27; CEO shared what appears to be concept art of an enemy set against a grimy, dilapidated sci-fi backdrop of smashed gangways and torn fences. 

&quot;Going through some of the concept art from our incredibly talented art team for @callistothegame today,&quot; Schofield tweeted along with the single image. &quot;It&#x27;s almost time to show you the real thing. Can&#x27;t wait.&quot;

Whilst the studio stopped short of detailing what&#x27;s caused the delay - &quot;project progress&quot; is all we&#x27;ve been told, although many suspect the strict Chinese quarantine may be affecting development - the upcoming update has been indefinitely postponed.

&quot;Due to project progress, the Version 2.7 update will be postponed,&quot; the developer tweeted. &quot;For detailed information on the date of the new update, content adjustment plan, and compensation, please stay tuned for upcoming announcements.&quot;

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known developer Sloclap&#x27;s challenging kung-fu beat-&#x27;em-up Sifu would be getting much-requested difficulty settings for some time, but now, following the release of a new content roadmap earlier this week, Sloclap has offered a closer look at how they&#x27;ll function when they arrive in a new update next Tuesday, 3rd May.


As we learned earlier this week, Sifu&#x27;s new difficulty levels will come in three flavours - Student, Disciple, and Master - and Sloclap&#x27;s latest preview trailer breaks each setting down in a little more detail. Disciple, for instance, will offer the &quot;classic Sifu experience&quot;, and it&#x27;s the option for those that want to continue playing the game as it is now.
Student, however, is designed for those wanting a slightly easier ride. It&#x27;ll make the experience &quot;more forgiving but still challenging&quot;, by increasing player health, making ageing more forgiving, and introducing weaker enemies with less aggressive AI that use simplified combos.

                              <span>As we teeter on the cusp of a brand-new month, Microsoft has whipped out its announcement horn to regale Xbox Live Gold subscribers with news of May&#x27;s Xbox Games With Gold, which this month include Yoku’s Island Express and Viva Piñata Party Animals.


Yoku’s Island Express, which will be available to download from 1st-31st May is a strange but successful blend of platforming and pinball that Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan liked a lot when it released back in 2018, calling it a &quot;wild-spirited adventure to cherish.&quot;


Next up, and available to download from 16th May to 15th June, is The Inner World: The Last Wind Monk. This one, developed by Studio Fizbin (responsible for last year&#x27;s striking Minute of Islands), is a follow-up to acclaimed 2013 point-and-click adventure The Inner World, and once again follows young, flute-nosed adventurer Robert on a quest to save the world.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s been taking the slow and steady approach to revealing more on Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion since its initial unveiling last year, but now, with its 30th June release approaching, the news is coming faster, and the publisher is promising &quot;exciting reveals&quot; and more for its next digital event on Tuesday, 10th May.


Precisely what will feature remains a mystery, but, alongside those aforementioned &quot;exciting reveals&quot;, Capcom is also promising new gameplay, a look at some new monsters, and other currently unspecified treats. If your interest is suitably piqued, proceedings kick off at 3pm in the UK/7am PDT on 10th May via Twitch, and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak’s director, Yoshitake Suzuki, will be on presenting duties.


Capcom’s previous Sunbreak digital event was a biggie, giving us a release date, a look at some new monsters, as well as an introduction to the expansion’s new hub area - the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost - and its new map, The Citadel. The latter promises to deliver a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece - and we got an extended tour in a subsequent video.

                              <span>Sony has confirmed it has removed the ability for existing PlayStation Plus subscribers to extend their subscription - blocking the ability for anyone to stack future membership via pre-paid cards - until the revamped service arrives in late June.


This week, PlayStation Plus subscribers found they were unable to redeem pre-paid voucher cards and extend their subscription time - even if it was about to run out. Bewildered customers were told the situation was &quot;temporary&quot;, but not given further explanation.


Now, Sony has updated its FAQ page for its upcoming PlayStation Plus changes and ackwnowledged the move - and said that, for now, you&#x27;ll only be able to redeem pre-paid vouchers you have bought after your current Plus membership expires.

If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the farming sim, the game opens with you inheriting land from your grandpa who has sadly passed away - shown in a brief scene at the start.


However, modders are now altering the scene to show grandpa in a variety of new... situations.

                              <span>New release windows have been revealed for several upcoming indie games, including Stray and Cult of the Lamb.
In a tweet from PlayStation, that also comes with a colourful teaser, the company revealed that Stray will be coming to consoles this summer. Previously we had been given an &quot;early 2022&quot; window but, given that we are now into Q2 and not been told a more concrete date, this new timeframe isn&#x27;t exactly a surprise. 
Along with Stray, We are OFK will also be releasing this summer. Meanwhile Cult of the Lamb, which was previously only slated for a release &quot;later this year&quot; will be coming our way this autumn.

                              <span>After employees from Blizzard Versailles were made redundant in 2020, a move that preceded the studio&#x27;s closure, those affected began a legal battle with the company. Now, staff that were made redundant have won their appeal.
As reported by French outlet Gamekult (via Gamesindustry.biz), an appeal court has invalidated the redundancies that led to the closure of the branch in 2020. As such, those looking to seek further legal actions will now potentially be entitled to &quot;further compensations, equivalent to a minimum of six months of salary&quot;.
But while this is certainly still a victory in itself, it does not mean former Blizzard Versailles employees will find their positions reinstated in a different studio.

His comment is taken from the Final Fantasy 35th anniversary Uniqlo magazine, which accompanies a new line of t-shirts celebrating the series.


Final Fantasy fan and translator Aitai Kimochi shared a translation of Naoki&#x27;s comments on Twitter, as he noted the game is now in the final stages of development.

                              <span>Bungie has suffered a setback in its bid to punish a group of cheaters who sold &quot;hacks&quot; for Destiny 2. 


A court has dimissed much of Bungie&#x27;s legal action against cheat site AimJunkies, in which it had alleged copyright and trademark infringement, as well as breach of contract, &quot;tortious interference&quot; and &quot;unjust enrichment&quot; (thanks, TorrentFreak).


AimJunkies had argued back and said its cheating software was its own work, not a copy of Bungie&#x27;s code. The Destiny developer&#x27;s other claims, it continued, should also be kept out of court per clauses in Bungie&#x27;s own user license agreement. Now, a US judge has largely agreed.

                              <span>Video games are wonderful things. They offer an escape from the mundane rigger of everyday life and give us the chance to experience whole new worlds of fantasy and adventure. However, while Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the galaxy certainly does this in spades with its eclectic cast and bustling locales, there is one area that is (for me at least) just like home. 
Yes, I am talking about that damn fridge on the Milano that just will not stay shut. No matter how many times you get Star-Lord to close the door, it will always reopen again (and again and again and again).
But it turns out I am not alone in my quest to get that door closed (we need to save energy here people). In fact, that little seemingly benign door has been closed a grand total of 18.6m times. Much like the Guardians of Galaxy devs do as well, I admire the tenacity.

                              <span>Pokémon Go&#x27;s upcoming set of official Pokémon Trading Cards has been shown off, with several dozen designs now available to browse.
Due to launch on 1st July via various box sets and booster packs, this &quot;first wave&quot; of products marks an unusual collaboration between the long-running Pokémon TCG and a Pokémon game not made by main series developer GameFreak.
Pleasingly, many of the designs feature nods to the game - such as stalwart Pokémon Go gym defender Blissey pictured sat atop a Valor gym.

The video in question shows footage from a demo, and uses the Megacity environment from The Matrix Awakens (you can check out Aiofe and Ian giving the Matrix a whirl below).
But back to Spider-Man. A YouTube user with the nickname Menterial used Lewis Fiford&#x27;s Spider-Man (thanks, DSOG) to add everyone&#x27;s favourite neighbourhood superhero into the sprawling Matrix city.

                              <span>Call of Duty developer Infinity Ward has now confirmed what was widely expected: its new entry in Activision&#x27;s long-running shooter series will be titled Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.


Yes, that&#x27;s exactly the same name as the same studio&#x27;s 2009 classic - which, with apologies, is now 13 years old.


Infinfity Ward revealed the name last night via Twitter, alongside the game&#x27;s logo. To me it looks more like MIIW rather than MWII. Others, meanwhile, have said it reminds them of Nine Inch Nails.

                              <span>This is rare:
An about 3-meter-long giant squid was found stranded on a beach here on April 20, in what local authorities said was a rare occurrence.
At around 10 a.m., a nearby resident spotted the squid at Ugu beach in Obama, Fukui Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. According to the Obama Municipal Government, the squid was still alive when it was found. It is unusual for a giant squid to be washed ashore alive, officials said.
The deep-sea creature will be transported to Echizen Matsushima Aquarium in the prefectural city of Sakai.

Sadly, I do not expect the giant squid to survive, certainly not long enough for me to fly there and see it. But if any Japanese readers can supply more information, I would very much appreciate it...</span>

                              <span>New research: “Are You Really Muted?: A Privacy Analysis of Mute Buttons in Video Conferencing Apps“:
Abstract: In the post-pandemic era, video conferencing apps (VCAs) have converted previously private spaces — bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens — into semi-public extensions of the office. And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users’ understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs — some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting — cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</span>

One of the highlights of hosting the weekly Kubernetes Podcast from Google is talking to the release managers for each new Kubernetes version. The release team is constantly refreshing. Many working their way from small documentation fixes, step up to shadow roles, and then eventually lead a release.
As we prepare for the 1.24 release next week, in accordance with long-standing tradition, I&#x27;m pleased to bring you a look back at the story of 1.23. The release was led by Rey Lejano, a Field Engineer at SUSE. I spoke to Rey in December, as he was awaiting the birth of his first child.
Make sure you subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts, so you hear all our stories from the Cloud Native community, including the story of 1.24 next week.

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s previously confirmed Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sequel is reportedly now targeting a 2023 launch, and will be skipping previous-gen consoles in favour of a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC release.


That&#x27;s according to VentureBeat reporter Jeff Grubb in his latest Grubbsnax episode (as transcribed by VGC), who claims publisher EA and Respawn had initially been aiming to launch the Fallen Order sequel later this year, but that those plans have since changed and the game &quot;is for sure now not coming out until 2023&quot;.


This later-than-planned release date combined with the decision to drop support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in favour of the newer consoles and PC means, according to Grubb, the development team won&#x27;t &quot;have to worry about trying to straddle these generation lines&quot;.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard stockholders have overwhelming voted in favour of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69BN acquisition of the publisher, with 98% of shares approving the transaction.


There&#x27;s still some way to go until the deal is finalise, however; while Activision Blizzard stockholders - and, earlier in the week, board members - have now given the deal the go-ahead, it&#x27;s still subject to regulatory review around the world, by the likes of the Federal Trade Commission in the US, to determine if the deal constitutes unfair competition.


Should the deal make it through regulatory review, the acquisition has until June 2023 to close, whereupon Microsoft will welcome some of the industries most recognisable franchises into its fold, including Call of Duty, Warcraft, Overwatch, and mobile hit Candy Crush.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s revamped PlayStation Plus isn&#x27;t too far away now, with the company currently targeting a 22nd June launch in Europe, but questions around the service still remain, particularly concerning the library of games that&#x27;ll be made to available to higher-tier subscribers. But while Sony&#x27;s lips remain officially sealed, it appears the first batch of retro games coming to the top-end Premium tier have begun leaking onto PSN.


PlayStation Plus&#x27; new Premium tier gives subscribers access to around 340 additional games beyond the library of 400 PS4 and PS5 titles included in the mid-range Extra tier, focusing on retro games from PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PSP. Sony is yet to offer specifics on either library, but users on Reddit have spotted that new listings for classic titles, complete with new thumbnail art, are starting to appear in the PSN backend, pointing to the beginnings of a roll-out for PlayStation Plus&#x27; retro games.


Granted, there are only three such titles to be found at present, all from publisher Bandai Namco - Tekken 2 and Mr. Driller for PlayStation 1, and Ridge Racer for PSP - but it does suggests the floodgates are slowly starting to open as publishers move to get their classic titles in order ready for the new PlayStation Plus launch.

                              <span>Yuji Naka, best known as the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog, says he was removed as director of Balan Wonderworld six months before its launch by Square Enix. 


The revelation comes from a Twitter thread posted by Yuji where states he filed a lawsuit against Square Enix following his dismissal, which has now been settled. 


Last year, Yuji left Square Enix following the disastrous launch of Balan Wonderworld, which sold less than 2100 copies in its opening week in Japan.

The teaser, which played while 343 Industries community director Brian Jarrard and community manager John Junyszek were going through cosmetic unlocks in the Season 2 Battle Pass, showed the logo for a company called &quot;Lux Voluspa&quot; before we hear two voices panicking about a &quot;missing core&quot;. 


The clip ends with a woman ominously saying &quot;they&#x27;re here&quot; and the return of the &quot;Lux Voluspa&quot; logo with the slogan: &quot;Artificial Minds. Real Solutions.&quot;

                              <span>Climate Replay, an independent group comprising of game developers, gamers themselves and leading climatologists, has shared a stark warning about the use of NFTs and their impact on the planet. It has also begun a pledge, encouraging those in the industry, as well as those who are against the use of NFTs in general, to sign and make positive moves towards a &quot;sustainable, socially responsible, equitable future for all&quot;.
Given the rise in blockchain technology, and the growing number of companies looking to implement it in their games, Climate Replay has additionally released a guide addressing everything that is wrong with NFTs.
&quot;NFTs are the digital elephant in the room for the games industry right now, and many are feeling the pressure to pick a side,&quot; Climate Replay wrote (via TheGamer). &quot;... This technology has massive implications for games, the climate crisis, and society at large. Our hope is that, by the end of this guide, readers will have a broad foundation of knowledge on top of which they can make truly informed decisions regarding NFTs.&quot;

The group, which is part of a contacted game services company named Keywords Studios, were recently told by that company they would need to return to office working full-time, five days a week, beginning in May (thanks, Kotaku).


In-office working - &quot;embedded&quot; within a developer - is one of the services which Keywords offers, and over the years the company has worked with BioWare and others to offer development support in this way.

Called Rengoku, the event lasts until 17th May and takes place in a modified version of the Skyscraper map. 


Players battle it out in a 5v5 capture point game mode that&#x27;s similar to Domination in other shooters like Call of Duty, except the capture points move every two minutes. The first team to reach 300 points wins.

                              <span>PlayStation owners looking to stock up on their Plus subscription through pre-paid cards report being unable to redeem the vouchers on their account. 


Several who have raised the matter with PlayStation customer support say they  have been told Sony has &quot;temporarily&quot; disabled the ability to stack Plus subscription time ahead of the new PS Plus changes due in June. 


Just yesterday, we covered how existing PlayStation Now owners with an active PS Plus subscription (who will get upgraded to the priciest PS Plus Premium tier) were trying to extend their PS Plus for as long as possible. Per PlayStation&#x27;s own FAQ page, the company will take the longest-running active subscription when setting the converted membership&#x27;s end date, essentially allowing Now members to stock up on regular Plus cards to receive the same time as a Premium subscriber.

                              <span>Microsoft is celebrating 20 years of Xbox in Scotland with a new partnership with Gordon Nicolson Kiltmakers and Lochcarron of Scotland. The end results - Xbox&#x27;s very own tartan, which is now on a controller (although I also spotted a rather dashing pair of trews, as well). 
&quot;The pattern, using the brand&#x27;s iconic colours, has been endorsed by the Scottish Tartans Authority and entered into The Scottish Register of Tartans,&quot; Xbox shared yesterday. &quot;The landmark pattern and limited-edition controllers commemorate the history of Xbox with a contemporary design created by Edinburgh-based tartan designer Gordon Nicolson, makers of the Scotland National Football Team Tartan.&quot;
Check out a video showing the making of Xbox&#x27;s new tartan below, as well as a closer look at a very smartly dressed controller (which appears to be a true Scotsman, as no underwear lies between the controller and its tartan cladding - cheeky).

                              <span>Reggie Fils-Aimé says he&#x27;s a believer in blockchain and so-called play-to-own technology. 


Speaking at last month&#x27;s SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, Fils-Aimé was asked what role blockchain, crypto and play-to-earn technology had in the future of gaming (thanks, Nintendo Life). 


He appeared to be quite enthusiastic about the idea: &quot;So I&#x27;m a believer in blockchain, I think it&#x27;s a really compelling technology. I&#x27;m also a believer in the concept of &#x27;play to own&#x27; within video games, and I say this as a player where I may have invested 50 hours, 100 hours, or 300 hours in a game, and when I&#x27;m ready to move on to something else, wouldn&#x27;t it be great to monetise what I&#x27;ve built?&quot;

Reddit user Mar_Reddit shared a video of the holy encounter (thanks Kotaku), where he invaded another player&#x27;s game only to discover dedicated role-players posing as Jesus and Satan awaiting him in the Rapture pose.


While he thought it was a trap, he moves closer to discover their true identities and share an Erdtree heal incantation like a prayer.

The advice, posted by Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese customer support Twitter account (thanks, Nintendo Life), warns that children should take care not to accidentally hit each other while playing. 


Anyone playing the game should stand a good distance from their TV, the advice continued, so you do not hit the Joy-Con controller on the screen.

At least six Russian Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors and other unattributed threats, have conducted destructive attacks, espionage operations, or both, while Russian military forces attack the country by land, air, and sea. It is unclear whether computer network operators and physical forces are just independently pursuing a common set of priorities or actively coordinating.

                              <span>Parkasuarus, WashBear Studio&#x27;s thoroughly enjoyable dinosaur theme park sim, is making its console debut tomorrow, 28th April, as it brings its adorable management action to Switch.


Parkasaurus, for those yet to experience the game&#x27;s vibrant, dino-infused spin on the classic theme park management formula, challenges players to build and run their very own dinosaur-flavoured tourist attraction - a task requiring them to hurtle back to the past to unearth new dinosaurs then build the perfect habitats to keep them happy, ensuring their specific terrain, water, food, privacy, and scenery needs are met.


And on top of all that, there are the usual park management demands to content with, ranging from landscaping and staff wrangling to ensuring all guests&#x27; needs - be they food, entertainment, merchandise, or bowel related - are adequately catered for.

                              <span>Thanks to the success of Stardew Valley and its ilk, you can barely move for video games insistently attempting to thrust you into some idyllic digital corner for a bout of wholesome pal-making or enthusiastic vegetable palpating these days, and now it&#x27;s Disney&#x27;s turn to get in on the action with its newly announced free-to-play village life sim Dreamlight Valley.


The set-up for Dreamlight Valley goes that, once upon a time, a bunch of Disney and Pixar characters all lived happily together in the idyllic land of the title - until, that is, a cataclysmic event known as the Forgetting stole everyone&#x27;s memories. It&#x27;s up to players, then, to explore and restore the kingdom (and its inhabitants&#x27; memories too), in an adventure that combines life-sim-style action with more traditional questing.


As Dreamlight Valley unfolds, players will be able to travel to exotic biomes beyond the village and befriend classic Disney and Pixar characters - each with their own story arcs, quests, and rewards - including the likes of Elsa and Anna in a snowy, Frozen-inspired kingdom, Ariel in a tropical corner of the world, and even the Lion King crew across a sunny savanna.

                              <span>As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty&#x27;s server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution has announced it&#x27;s implemented a new mitigation technique, known as Cloaking, that will prevent cheaters from seeing opponents during a match.


As explained in new blog post highlighting the latest developments for Call of Duty&#x27;s Ricochet anti-cheat solution, Cloaking follows a similar philosophy to its previous Damage Shield initiative in that it&#x27;s designed to &quot;give legitimate players a leg up on cheaters.&quot;


While Damage Shield effectively turned on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater was detected in a match, Cloaking aims its focus squarely at the cheater, making it impossible for them to see opponents, bullets, and even sounds. &quot;Legitimate players, however,&quot; the post explains, &quot;can see cheaters impacted by cloaking (generally, they’ll be the players you see spinning in circles hollering, &#x27;Who is shooting me?!&#x27;) and can dole out in-game punishment.&quot;

This means anyone still with an active Now subscription who has also stacked a PS Plus sub for months (or even years) to come will get converted to Premium for as long as their existing Plus sub is set last.


The difficulty in taking advantage of this now is that Sony has stopped selling Now subscriptions - presumably to deter people who were previously not Now subscribers but who are after a bargain.

                              <span>Twitch is reportedly looking to make changes to its partner programme, which would include paying top streamers less with an adjusted revenue split.


At present the revenue split for partners is 50/50 for a tier one subscription, 60/40 at tier two, and 70/30 at tier three, in favour of the streamer. Some top Twitch partners have privately negotiated an alternative revenue split.


However, according to a new report from Bloomberg, this revenue split may be pared down to a 50 percent cut across the board.

Devotion will be the 11th Tome added to the narrative Archive mode that will explore the background of existing survivor David King, as well as the memories of killers The Twins.


David is a fan-favourite survivor, described by developer Behaviour as a &quot;hot-tempered ruffian with a penchant for a good scrap&quot;. Many fans read the character as gay; now this new story content will make that a reality as his past struggles with identity are revealed.

                              <span>Those who have been exploring the Lands Between in Elden Ring over the last couple of months will have likely come across the game&#x27;s singing bat enemies. These enemies have humanoid facial features and will attack when approached. However, these mysterious creatures are often heard before they are seen, as (as their name suggests) they sing a rather haunting song known as the Song of Lament.
This song is sung in Latin, adding to the mysterious aura that surrounds these bats. However, one player has recently discovered a translation of the bats&#x27; song and revealed its unsettling translation.
Twitter user Chinchillazilla (via Screen Rant) wrote, &quot;just learned that the singing bats in Elden Ring are singing in Latin and their song is a huge bummer&quot;. The user then went on leave a copy of the translated song for others to mull over.

Spoiler warning: The Last of Us Part 2 plot and ending details follow.
Questions like, can you save Joel from death? Can you kill Abby in Santa Barbara? What happens if Abby jumps out of the car before being ambushed by the Scars? Basically, can you manipulate The Last of Us Part 2 to get a happier or different ending? These are things I need to know.

The previously announced 1/6 scale figurine was revealed last weekend and is available globally as part of its Masterline series. It features Final Fantasy 6 character Terra riding Magitek armour.


Sakaguchi responded on Twitter saying &quot;Isn&#x27;t this a bit much? Are you okay Square Enix?&quot;, according to several translations shared by Kotaku.

The warning these so-called &quot;vampire devices&quot; are draining power - expensive for you, but also unecessary for the planet - comes as the UK faces an unprecedented energy price hike, while gas and electricity companies continue to turn massive profits. 


Indeed, the language of today&#x27;s call from British Gas has been criticised for passing the blame for high bills onto consumers. There have also been questions asked about the numbers British Gas has used to calculate its savings.

                              <span>One of the joys of Supermassive Games&#x27; titles are their focus on player choice, and as a result, the branching narratives created on any given playthrough. However, this means that there are multiple different endings that players can achieve, and The Quarry is no exception. In fact, there are going to be an incredible 186 unique endings scripted into the game. Consider my jaw dropped.
Chatting to IGN, The Quarry director Will Byles broke down how exactly one goes about making a game with so many variables, and the impressive work from the actors.
&quot;We write it like a movie screenplay... actors are used to a 100-page script [on a feature film], the script for this is over 1000 pages. [The actors] can get very alarmed,&quot; Byles revealed.

Yoshida has penned a blog post response, noting that such behaviour is prohibited - including the amusing firework emote.

A matchmaking issue which caused a very long transition from Story Mode to GTA Online has also been fixed.

                              <span>Sifu is set to receive difficulty options this spring, as revealed in a new content roadmap.


The kung-fu beat &#x27;em up is brutally hard and was criticised at launch for not including difficulty options. Developer Sloclap previously announced it would be adding in options - and now we know when.


The three options will be named Student, Disciple, and Master.

There is not too much longer to wait until Halo Infinite&#x27;s second season - Lone Wolves - makes its debut. However, following the reveal of the season&#x27;s new roadmap, many within the Halo community have started to ask more about their own hopes and desires for the game&#x27;s future. 
One such member made a heartfelt plea to see Cortana as an AI. But alas, this is one dream that will not be realised, at least not any time soon.

                              <span>Microsoft says it is gaining console market share globally thanks to the success of Xbox Series X/S.


The comments came from Microsoft boss Satya Nadella, speaking during the company&#x27;s third quarter results call. 


Nadella did not say which company it has specifically gained market share from, though quarterly results from US numbers firm NPD this week pointed to Xbox availability being key, compared to the supply-constrained PlayStation.

The previous update to the game added a bug where the already notoriously tricky boss was made more difficult by self-healing when joined by a summoned player in multiplayer.


Now she&#x27;s back to her usual (still tricky) self, along with a couple of other fixes.

                              <span>Both Google and Mandiant are reporting a significant increase in the number of zero-day vulnerabilities reported in 2021.
Google:
2021 included the detection and disclosure of 58 in-the-wild 0-days, the most ever recorded since Project Zero began tracking in mid-2014. That’s more than double the previous maximum of 28 detected in 2015 and especially stark when you consider that there were only 25 detected in 2020. We’ve tracked publicly known in-the-wild 0-day exploits in this spreadsheet since mid-2014.
While we often talk about the number of 0-day exploits used in-the-wild, what we’re actually discussing is the number of 0-day exploits detected and disclosed as in-the-wild. And that leads into our first conclusion: we believe the large uptick in in-the-wild 0-days in 2021 is due to increased detection and disclosure of these 0-days, rather than simply increased usage of 0-day exploits...</span>

Microsoft has gone from the bad old days of being generally obnoxious, to being the de facto stewards of everyone else&#x27;s open source code by way of GitHub, as well as putting out Visual Studio Code, the TypeScript programming language, and a mountain more.

                              <span>Last month, Soulsborne dataminer Lance McDonald offered Elden Ring fans a peek behind the Lands Between&#x27;s ordinarily sealed colosseum doors, and now, a fresh delve inside has revealed more of what may have been planned for the currently dormant structures during development.


Elden Ring players will no doubt be familiar with the gargantuan colosseums that lie at three points on the map - one just beyond Stormveil Bridge, another jutting out from Caelid&#x27;s coastline, and a third set high above Leyndell, Royal Capital. They&#x27;re imposing things on the outside, and McDonald&#x27;s initial boundary break video revealed, somewhat surprisingly given their impenetrable nature, that developer FromSoftware hadn&#x27;t skimped on their innards either.


By following a series of intricate passageways beyond one of the colosseum&#x27;s closed doors, McDonald emerged in a vast arena overlooked by a lavishly rendered viewing area. And while the discovery lead some to theorise the arenas could be intended for PvP play at some future point, a fresh delve has suggested there maybe a little more going on.

                              <span>2K Games is reportedly looking to take on developer Psyonix&#x27;s mighty Rocket League, and is currently developing its own spin on the four-wheeled football formula, titled Gravity Goal, that&#x27;ll supposedly switch out the cars in favour of TRON-like bikes.


That&#x27;s according to reliably leaky journalist Tom Henderson who, writing for Exputer, claims Gravity Goal will be &quot;just like Rocket League&quot; in as far as it&#x27;ll offer up 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 matches where the aim is for players to knock a ball into a goal using their vehicles.


Henderson reports a number of twists on the Rocket League formula, however; alongside the switch from cars to TRON-like bikes - an aesthetic that&#x27;ll reportedly be reflected in Gravity Goal&#x27;s arenas, sporting a &quot;futuristic and high-energy-based vibe&quot; - players will be able to damage their opponents&#x27; bikes by hitting them with a hockey-puck-like disc. This&#x27;ll supposedly also either slow down or stop any vehicles it hits.

                              <span>Following Netflix&#x27;s initial dalliances with video games toward the end of last year, which saw the streaming service begin offering a small selection of casual mobile games to subscribers, the streaming service is reportedly looking to significantly ramp up its offerings before the end of 2022, expanding its gaming library to almost 50 titles.


When Netflix launched its fledging video game service last November, subscribers were able to choose between a total of five games as part  of their normal subscription. That number has steadily grown since then, with Netflix currently offering 18 games to subscribers - but a new report by the Washington Post says the company is going big in 2022, aiming to offer nearly 30 more titles by the end of the year.


There&#x27;s currently no indication of what these titles may be - other than that Netflix will reportedly be sticking with mobile games &quot;for now&quot; - but we do know the streaming service has been attempting to expand its video game development know-how since last year, in the form of three studio acquisitions. It now owns Texas-based mobile developer Boss Fight Entertainment, Next Games - which made Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales - and, as of last September, Oxenfree developer Night School Studio.

                              <span>Sega has revealed it&#x27;ll be delisting the standalone versions of Sonic of the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3, and CD from all digital stores on 20th May - just in time, although it doesn&#x27;t say as much, for the the arrival of its upcoming retro bundle, Sonic Origins.


Currently, standalone copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3, and CD can be purchased for between £3-4 a piece on Steam and the Xbox Store, putting their combined value significantly below the £32.99/$39.99 asking price of Sonic Origins&#x27; standard edition.


As of those games&#x27; delisting on 20th May, however, the only way to purchase Sonic&#x27;s early titles digitally will be via Sonic Origins, with the one exception: the Sega Ages versions of Sonic 1 and 2 on Switch will remain on sale. Sega also notes Sonic the Hedgehog 2 will remain playable as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + subscription.

                              <span>The pricier new PlayStation Plus Premium subscription will include time-limited game trials - and now Sony has reportedly informed some developers it will need to ensure it provides them. 


According to a GameDeveloper report, PlayStation has updated its developer guidelines to state that a game demo lasting at least two hours will now be required for any title which costs $34 or higher (around £27). 


This rule is not retroactive, so will only apply to games currently in development and not yet released. Additionally, developers will have a three-month grace period after a game launches before this trial must be made available.

                              <span>Bethesda has released another video ahead of Starfield&#x27;s approaching release date, this time focusing on the game&#x27;s music and sound design. 
In this video, entitled &quot;The Sound of Adventure&quot;, audio director Mark Lampert and Starfield composer Inon Zur chat more about what music means to them, and why it is important for the overall gameplay experience.
&quot;I always say, music is the fourth dimension. It is the emotional dimension,&quot; Zur explains. &quot;In order to create this, you have to ask these questions - where are you going? What is your motivation? What is your story? What is really pushing us?&quot; It is these questions, that Zur says are &quot;as big as space&quot;, that drove the compressor forward with his work on the game.

                              <span>Monthly active users of Activision games fell by a third over the past 12 months, the company has confirmed. 


In March 2021, Activision had 150 million monthly active players across its games (at this point, a figure likely dominated by those playing Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty Warzone).


In March 2022, Activision had 100 million monthly active players - a third less than a year ago.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if The Truman Show and Deathloop had a baby, and that baby also had some Hunger Games bloodlust running through its veins? And yet, despite all this, was still somehow colourful and cute looking? Well, wonder no more, as Call of the Sea developer Out of the Blue has today announced its latest game - American Arcadia - and it looks like that is just what it&#x27;s going to be. 
You can check out the new teaser for yourself below.
American Arcadia tasks players with escaping a seemingly idyllic life of luxury. However - plot twist (which admittedly I may have spoiled with my opening sentence) - this life is not all it is cracked up to be. Rather, residents in this apparent utopia are under the watchful gaze of &quot;countless anonymous observers&quot;. Shudders.

                              <span>A new LinkedIn listing has pointed to the previously-reported The Last of Us remake. 
Naughty Dog QA Corey Hong has both &quot;QA testing and development support on environment design for unannounced multiplayer project&quot; and &quot;QA testing and development support + Level Point of Contact for unannounced remake project&quot; listed on their resumé. This, fans expect, relates to both The Last of Us&#x27; long-awaited standalone multiplayer component and a remake of the initial game. 
While Naughty Dog has never officially announced it is remaking The Last of Us, its existence was first reported over a year ago now. Bloomberg initially revealed the project, claiming that it was in development at an unannounced new studio created within its little-known San Diego-based Visual Arts Service Group, but was handed to Naughty Dog after Sony had a change of mind.

The event - titled Gaming Prom – From 8-Bit to Infinity - will be held on Monday, 1st August at the Royal Albert Hall and feature a new arrangement of music from Battlefield 2042 as originally composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir and Sam Slater, performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

                              <span>Combined sales of the Xbox Series X and S consoles gave Microsoft its biggest March in terms of hardware revenue for a decade. 


Xbox Series X/S led the US console market in March - and cumulatively over the year&#x27;s first quarter - in terms of dollar sales, according to numbers from analytics firm NPD. 


However, Nintendo Switch still was the US&#x27; best-selling console in terms of units sold, in March and across 2022 to date.

                              <span>Ubisoft has ended the online services for 90 of its games. Don&#x27;t be too alarmed though, as they are all from a considerably older catalogue of titles. We are talking about games such as Scrabble 2007 and Far Cry on PC.
Other games affected by this announcement include Splinter Cell: Double Agent for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Tom Clancy&#x27;s EndWar (also for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) and Watch Dogs Companion for Andriod and iOS, with the full list available here.
However, do not worry if you still enjoy a twirl around the dancefloor with the likes of the Xbox 360&#x27;s Just Dance 3, as the offline features for each game will still remain available.

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has now officially announced its overhaul of the Mega Evolution mechanic, which was previously leaked through datamined game files. 


As expected, the changes go a long way to answering fan criticism of the way Pokémon Go has handled Mega Evolution since it was introduced in August 2020 - in particular, adding the ability to re-Mega Evolve a creature without energy cost after it has been Mega Evolved once.


Players in Australia and New Zealand can access the new system now, with a global rollout expected shortly. (The game&#x27;s next Mega Pokémon release is due this Friday, so we&#x27;d expect before then.)

                              <span>Workers at Call of Duty developer Raven Software are now one step closer to realising their unionisation efforts, something which, it&#x27;s fair to say, has not been encouraged by parent company Activision Blizzard.
Axios has reported that those at Raven Software have now obtained approval from the National Labour Relations Board to move forward with a vote on whether to unionise. This is a major step for the QA team, as previous efforts for voluntary recognition from ABK had been denied. This latest approval means that legally, should the vote to unionise be won by the majority of workers, Activision Blizzard will have to recognise its workers&#x27; terms and conditions.
&quot;Once a union has been certified or recognised, the employer is required to bargain over your terms and conditions of employment with your union representative,&quot; states the NLRB.

                              <span>Sony has confirmed it&#x27;ll finally start rolling out Variable Refresh Rate support to PlayStation 5 in the new few days, with patches to implement the feature across a variety of games - included Spider-Man and Resident Evil Village - set to follow &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;.


VRR dynamically syncs the refresh rate of HDMI 2.1 VRR-compatible TVs and PC monitors to the PlayStation 5&#x27;s graphical output, helping, as Sony puts it in its announcement post, to minimise or eliminate visual artifacts, including frame pacing issues and screen tearing.


&quot;Gameplay in many PS5 titles feels smoother as scenes render seamlessly, graphics look crisper, and input lag is reduced,&quot; it adds.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s Ace Attorney series has some very good music (especially the one that goes dur-doo-dur-doo-dur-doo-dur-doo-dur-durr from the first Phoenix Wright game) and the publisher is celebrating that fact once again this year with a new live orchestral concert, being streamed across the internet in May.
Following on from last year&#x27;s similarly styled event, Capcom is poised to hold another Ace Attorney orchestra concert on 7th May at the Bunkamura Orchard Hall in Shibuya, Tokyo, this time in honour of the series&#x27; 20th anniversary.
If your interest is piqued, the official website has now revealed the full, series-spanning set list for the 20th anniversary concert (which you&#x27;ll find below) and you can get a solid idea of what&#x27;s in store by watching this 7-minute snippet from the 2021 show.

                              <span>This weekend marked the tenth anniversary of Telltale Games&#x27; celebrated The Walking Dead series, and to mark the occasion, publisher Skybound Games has released a new mini-documentary bringing with it various behind-the-scenes treats, including early prototype footage, and even the revelation that Telltales&#x27; genre-defining adventure was at one point planned to be a Left 4 Dead spin-off.


Telltale Games&#x27; The Walking Dead first released on 24th April 2012, and, over the course of Season 1&#x27;s five critically acclaimed episodes, would establish not only the template for pretty much every one of the studio&#x27;s releases from that point onward - blending real-time events and persistent choices - but a host of other narrative-driven adventures too, most notably the work of Life is Strange developer Dontnod.


However, as revealed by The Walking Dead&#x27;s season design and direction lead Jake Rodkin in the newly released mini-documentary, Telltale could have ended up with a very different zombie experience if it&#x27;s original plans had come to pass, given the project started life as a pitch to do a narrative side-story within Valve&#x27;s Left 4 Dead universe.

                              <span>Right on cue, with Apex Legends&#x27; current season rapidly racing towards its conclusion, developer Respawn Entertainment has started cranking the hype handle for the free-to-play battle royale shooter&#x27;s imminent thirteenth instalment - confirming that Newcastle will play a major role when it launches on 10th May.
Newcastle, who&#x27;ll be Season 13&#x27;s latest playable hero (sorry to disappoint if you had other ideas), is described as the Hero of Harris Valley, but, more importantly in lore terms, has a direct connection to another Apex Legends character - with Respawn confirming Newcastle to be none other than Jackson Williams, the long-missing brother of Bangalore.
Newcastle&#x27;s arrival in Apex Legends isn&#x27;t too much of a surprise, of course; back in March, a huge Apex Legends leak seemingly revealed, accurately it now appears, the game&#x27;s next nine seasons&#x27; worth of unannounced heroes - with Newcastle being the most likely candidate for Season 13 at the time, given his advanced stages of development.

In addition to this, the companies also revealed that Valheim had an all-time player peak of 502,000 – not too mead-iocre at all. In fact, the player numbers were so good, that in just over two weeks, Valheim sold an astounding 3m units.

The new Warzone, which Activision today again described nebulously as an &quot;experience&quot; rather than a fresh update or full sequel, will also be free-to-play. 


It&#x27;s being &quot;built from the ground-up&quot; alongside this year&#x27;s main Call of Duty release, Activision said, which is a sequel to Infinity Ward&#x27;s 2019 Modern Warfare.

                              <span>After a controversial launch and a series of updates focussed on course correction, Gran Turismo 7 got its first proper content drop today, bringing three new cars and a sort of new track into the mix, as well as a suite of fixes and new features. 


Let&#x27;s get the disappointing bit out the way first - the new track on offer is the 24-hour layout of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, which makes bold and daring changes to the layout you&#x27;ll likely know well by…. Changing the position of the start/finish straight. So it&#x27;s the same track you know and love, with Eau Rouge serving as the first corner rather than La Source, but this new configuration inspired by the round-the-clock race does at least suggest extended support of Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s time-of-day feature. 


In terms of new cars, leading the charge is the Subaru BRZ GT300 which was seen challenging and indeed conquering last year&#x27;s Super GT series, and it&#x27;s joined by its road legal offspring the freshly tweaked Subaru BRZ S. For lovers of kei cars there&#x27;s a neat surprise in the diminutive form of the Suzuki Cappucino EA11R from 1991 (you&#x27;ll find it on sale in the used car dealership).

                              <span>Peridot, the next game from Pokémon Go maker Niantic, has begun to roll out via its recently-announced soft launch. 


So far, the cute Tamagotchi-like app has become available in Malaysia - and footage of the game&#x27;s opening stages has been posted online. 


Around 10 minutes of footage from one user reveals Peridot&#x27;s opening tutorial, item shop and a list of possible tasks to increase your creature&#x27;s happiness. These tasks include pointing your phone camera (and therefore your Peridot pet) at specific objects like a flower, a cat or a dog.

                              <span>GSC Game World, the Kyiv-based developer of Stalker 2, has had its website blocked by the Russian government. 


The Stalker 2 website, unsurprisingly, includes a message of support for Ukraine. The developer has also called for an end to Russia&#x27;s brutal invasion of its home country, as it struggles to continue development while Kyiv has been under attack.


Now, the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office of the Russian Federation has blocked access to the website for Russian audiences, removing access to anyone in the country without use of a proxy. The RIA Novosti news agency said the move followed GSC&#x27;s decision to cease business in Russia (thanks, XGP.pl, via VGC).

Co-operative gameplay has been a staple of FromSoftware&#x27;s games since Demon&#x27;s Souls, allowing players to summon in help. However, if either player dies they must restart again; and if a boss is defeated, the summoned player will still be booted.


YouTuber LukeYui is now working on a mod that will stop players from being booted out during multiplayer (spotted by TheGamer).

&quot;To do so, you&#x27;ll need to pay the difference between the current plan and your new plan, adjusted for the remaining time of your subscription.&quot; However, there is nothing about if it will be as easy to go the other way...

At least two firms are eyeing up Ubisoft ahead of a potential future offer, Bloomberg has reported, though &quot;serious negotiations&quot; are yet to take place. These companies include Blackstone and KKR &amp; Co., two of the world&#x27;s largest in the takeover market.
In a subsequent Kotaku report, sources suggested Ubisoft has been quietly auditing parts of its business over the past year - a potential sign it may be readying itself for a future suitor.

It comes almost a year after Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford stated that PlayStation cross-platform support would be cut from an upcoming Borderlands 3 patch without explaining why. The decision was then reversed last month, again without explanation.

Confirmation came by way of the official Borderlands Twitter page, which finally gave us a window - if not yet an exact date - as to when PlayStation players will be able to hook up with their pals on other platforms: spring 2022.

                              <span>Apple has notified developers that apps and games that have gone two full years without an update may be at risk of being removed from the App Store. 

The change comes as part of Apple&#x27;s App Store improvement scheme which aims to make the online shop easier to use and ensure customers &quot;find great apps that fit their needs&quot; that are compatible with newer iOS devices.

In an email to Protopop Games, Apple reportedly said: &quot;This app has not been updated in a significant amount of time and is scheduled to be removed from sale in 30 days. No action is required for the app to remain available to users who have already downloaded the app.

                              <span>Sony is on the hunt for a senior director of PC planning and strategy.

The new position - which will sit within PlayStation Global and, despite the pandemic, insists the successful candidate relocates to California - wants to &quot;bring the best of the PlayStation experiences to markets and channels around the world&quot;, hinting that Sony may be ready to further strengthen its PC presence.

&quot;The successful candidate will be responsible for the strategy and commercial activity within global channel sales and will deliver a single, optimised PC sales growth and commercial plan to hub and territory teams to implement  [and] identifying future sectors &amp; partnerships for commercial growth,&quot; the job ad states (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;The plan should support the delivery of the agreed global channel sales critical metrics.&quot;

                              <span>Koei Tecmo has confirmed its increasing its average basic salary in Japan by 23 per cent.

The increase - which sees the average salary jump by ¥73,000 (that&#x27;s £442) a month - follows similar initiatives by Bandai Namco and Capcom in a bid to attract and retain its staff.

The company has also pledged to boost the starting salary for new graduates from ¥234,000 to ¥290,000 - that&#x27;s a jump from around £1417 a month to £1756 in order to &quot;improve the motivation&quot; and &quot;welfare&quot; of its staff.

                              <span>An update to Call of Duty developer Infinity Ward&#x27;s Twitter page has fans speculating that the team may be ready to announced a new Modern Warfare game.

On Friday, Infinity Ward switched out both its Twitter banner and profile icon which - at first blush, anyway - seemed to be solid black logos with no image or text. 

Brightened up, however, and eagle-eyed players think they&#x27;ve spotted fan-favourite character Ghost lurking in the background, sparking whispers that an announcement is imminent.

Confirmation came via animation director Bruno Velazquez after a fan pressed for an update on Twitter.

When asked to &quot;reassure us&quot; that the sequel &quot;will come this year 100 per cent&quot;, Velazquez responded with a simple: &quot;Ragnarok is coming this year&quot;.

                              <span>Following GOG&#x27;s example, CD Projekt is reportedly considering introducing paid menstrual leave for its employees.
In recognition of the impact period pain has on some staff, at the time of the announcement GOG said the &quot;experimental&quot; leave &quot;breaks taboos&quot; and is &quot;yet another step towards making GOG an even more inclusive workplace&quot;, but it won’t stop its &quot;continuous efforts to learn, reflect and improve on how we can do better for all of our team members&quot;.

Given the initiative was announced at the start of April not everyone was convinced of the sincerity of the announcement, but Axios confirms the scheme was introduced following the personal experiences from inside GOG&#x27;s own team.

                              <span>Games merchandiser Numskull has unveiled a new range of Silent Hill collectables, kicking off with the Bubble Head Nurse. 

Styled on the variant found in Silent Hill 2 rather than Homecoming or the movies, the 9-inch tall &quot;super-exclusive&quot; statue is officially sanctioned by Konami and comes &quot;with all the finishing touches that fans would expect to see&quot;.

&quot;Straight from the highly acclaimed horror game Silent Hill 2 comes a high-quality statue of the iconic Bubble Head Nurse, a sinister female monster manifested from James Sunderland’s subconscious,&quot; the blurb explains.

                              <span>The release of Halo Infinite&#x27;s co-op campaign has seemingly slipped to August 2022.

The co-op campaign was expected to release next month after it was delayed from the initial launch. However, last month developer 343 Industries acknowledged that it needed &quot;more time&quot; to work on the cooperative campaign and Forge, and cooperative missions would not be available in May as hoped.

Now, in an image on the company&#x27;s latest news update, 343i has revealed the &quot;target&quot; for campaign co-op is August, along with campaign mission replay. The Forge Open Beta is slated for September, but split-screen isn&#x27;t expected until sometime during November&#x27;s Season 3.

&quot;There are no good guys, no bad guys, with only nature as the adversary,&quot; a press statement teases. &quot;A sandstorm will appear randomly in wild areas of battle royale. Players entering the sandstorm will be challenged to avoid hurricanes and tornadoes to reach the high-tier loot and special items contained within the weather event.&quot;

Dropping on 28th April at 1am UK time, season 4 also offers two new maps - Cold War&#x27;s Satellite and Modern Warfare 2019&#x27;s Khandor Hideout - as well as new operators, weapons, blueprints, calling cards, charms, and COD Points, plus 50 new tiers of &quot;Battle Pass rewards&quot;.

                              <span>Interesting:
Drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, engineers at the University of California, Irvine invented an adaptive composite material that can insulate beverage cups, restaurant to-go bags, parcel boxes and even shipping containers.
[…]
“The metal islands in our composite material are next to one another when the material is relaxed and become separated when the material is stretched, allowing for control of the reflection and transmission of infrared light or heat dissipation,” said Gorodetsky. “The mechanism is analogous to chromatophore expansion and contraction in a squid’s skin, which alters the reflection and transmission of visible light.”...</span>

                              <span>Interesting implementation mistake:
The vulnerability, which Oracle patched on Tuesday, affects the company’s implementation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm in Java versions 15 and above. ECDSA is an algorithm that uses the principles of elliptic curve cryptography to authenticate messages digitally.
[…]
ECDSA signatures rely on a pseudo-random number, typically notated as K, that’s used to derive two additional numbers, R and S. To verify a signature as valid, a party must check the equation involving R and S, the signer’s public key, and a cryptographic hash of the message. When both sides of the equation are equal, the signature is valid. ...</span>

                              <span>Lego is now firmly entrenched in the world of video games, what with its sets inspired by the likes of Mario, Sonic, and Minecraft, and that looks set to continue with an official Lego version of the iconic Atari 2600 having now been uncovered for apparent release later this year.


As reported by Promobricks (via VGC), an official Lego version of the Atari 2600 console - which initially released as the Atari VCS all the way back in 1977 - complete with distinctive wooden trim, will arrive this August as part of Atari&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations.


Promobricks says the set - not to to be confused with the fan-made submission on Lego&#x27;s Ideas website - will include a Lego rendition of the console itself (said to be roughly the size of the 1977 original), a replica of the equally iconic CX40 joystick, plus a cartridge of gaming classic Pitfall! fashioned from plastic bricks.

                              <span>Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers have become notorious for their struggles with &quot;drift&quot;, to the point that lawsuits have been launched over the issue, the EU has pledged to investigate, and Nintendo&#x27;s president has even formally apologised. A new report, though, shines additional light on the extent of the issue, claiming that Nintendo&#x27;s US arm was receiving &quot;easily thousands&quot; of faulty controllers a week for repair at the height of the problem.


That&#x27;s according to a new report by Kotaku, which, citing a former supervisor at the Switch repair facility (run by United Radio under contract with Nintendo), claims the volume of repairs got so high - with &quot;hundreds&quot; of faulty controllers arriving each day - that work became &quot;very stressful&quot;, leading to high turnover in the department and &quot;lots of&quot; repair mistakes.


Nintendo&#x27;s initial response to the Joy-Con drift problem, reportedly saw the company providing replacements for customers&#x27; faulty Joy-Cons between 2017 and 2018; however, that policy is said to have eventually changed and repair staff were then required to repair every set of Joy-Cons received. At the height of Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con drift issues, Nintendo&#x27;s repair centre was reportedly receiving “easily thousands&quot; of faulty units each week, necessitating the establishment of new workplace specifically for controller repairs.

And now it&#x27;s delivered, giving the overhauled subscription service a launch target of 22nd June in Europe and 13th June in the US.


That&#x27;s according to an update on Sony&#x27;s official PlayStation Blog which, alongside the target dates mentioned above, also reveals a planned 1st June launch for the new PlayStation Plus in Japan and an even earlier 23rd May arrival in all other Asian markets.


Sony&#x27;s overhauled PlayStation Plus combines elements of its existing PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now subscription services into one, offering three distinct subscription tiers - Essential, Extra, and Premium - each with their own distinct features.

                              <span>Dying Light 2 might have had a rocky road to release, but it looks like the project has paid off for developer Techland; the studio has revealed its zombie parkour sequel has surpassed 5m copies sold across all platforms since its launch at the start of February, with that number reflective of sales as of 28th February and said to be &quot;significantly growing&quot; each month.


By way of comparison, we can look toward Dying Light&#x27;s original instalment, also regarded as a sizeable hit for the studio. That game - according to new figures released by Techland today - has now sold 20m copies since launching a little over seven years ago in 2015, meaning its follow-up really is off to a flying start.


All that suggests a healthy future for Dying Light 2 - doubtlessly reassuring for Techland, given the developer has already committed to five years of post-launch DLC support for the game. Already that promise has brought the likes of new armour, weapons, events, and challenges to the game, with the first bit of substantial post-launch story content scheduled to arrive this June.

As wizardry students advance their magic becomes more powerful, which will be needed not just in duels, but in dealing with ancient curses and nefarious enemies looming about the school.


Though the wizardry course has been spotted in previous trailers, a new course reveal video has given a more detailed look at the classes - you can watch it below.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 will launch for Nintendo Switch on Friday, 9th September, Nintendo has confirmed. 


A new trailer today has showcased its 4v4 online Turf War battle mode across &quot;a mix of new and familiar stages&quot;. Fresh off the boat here is Eeltail Alley, a new level, and the stringer, a bow-shaped weapon type you can fire ink from both vertically and horizontally.


In single-player mode, meanwhile, you&#x27;ll fight the Octarians and &quot;discover the secrets of Alterna and the Fuzzy Ooze&quot;. I have no doubt Splatoon master and Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson is excited by the sounds of that.

This update, and the timing of it, suggests all of these games may well be making their way to Sony&#x27;s upcoming Premium tier subscription package, which promises access to a catalogue of &quot;beloved classic games&quot;. 
The only games in the series to have not been given a rating for modern consoles are Syphon Filter 3 (which originally released for PlayStation on all the way back in 2001), and Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain, which came out on the PlayStation 2 in 2004. 
Below is a table showing these new ratings from the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea (via Gematsu).

                              <span>Earlier this week, Sega screwed up its announcement of a promising-looking Sonic Origins retro collection by listing a bizarre selection of pre-order bonuses, DLC and deluxe edition content. 
&quot;Character animation in the main menu&quot; and &quot;camera controls over the main menu islands&quot; were listed as being part of the Premium Fun Pack DLC or the game&#x27;s Digital Deluxe Edition. The same is true of the game&#x27;s &quot;Hard Missions&quot;.
A bonus listed simply as &quot;Letterbox Background&quot; is highlighted as being available in either the Premium Fun Pack DLC or the separate Start Dash Pack DLC - free but only if you pre-order.

                              <span>It has been over 20 years since Kao, the boxing glove wearing kangaroo from the land down under, first made his debut. But he is now back again and will be hopping into our lives for a rebooted hurrah on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam) on Friday 27th May. And what will his reboot be called? Well, Kao the Kangaroo, of course.
&quot;We&#x27;ve been blown away by the response we&#x27;ve had from gamers since we announced Kao the Kangaroo was making a return earlier this year,&quot; said Kaja Borowko, head of Kao developer Tate Multimedia. 
&quot;With this new chapter, we&#x27;ve set out to make sure the new Kao the Kangaroo both honours his previous outings and offers fresh, contemporary gameplay for fans new and old alike. This is a complete reboot for Kao, and we can&#x27;t wait to see how people take to it at launch!&quot; You can check out Kao&#x27;s new trailer below.

Speaking to Edge magazine (spotted by VGC), Shinkawa was asked about any future ambitions.


&quot;One day I would like to design a car - a real car,&quot; he replied. &quot;This has been a long-held ambition for me.&quot;

                              <span>A judge has dismissed the majority of a gender discrimination lawsuit lodged against PlayStation by a former employee.


The case, filed in November last year by ex-PlayStation IT analyst Emma Majo, claimed PlayStation paid women less than men in similar jobs and were held back from promotions. Majo also claimed she had been wrongfully fired &quot;soon after&quot; reporting gender bias. 


In a new ruling, reported by Axios, a judge has now decided much of Majo&#x27;s case lacked necessary evidence.

&quot;Hold on to your… everything. 😱 The MONSTER OF ALL BATTLES is coming,&quot; Activision proclaimed on Thursday. This crossover, which is known as Operation Monarch, will go live on 11th May.

The new Tales game will launch this year and feature a fresh cast of characters, Gearbox&#x27;s colourful CEO Randy Pitchford announced on stage at PAX East last night. 


In development for &quot;many&quot; years, the project has been worked on in-house at Gearbox after the developer saw the critical success of the original Tales - and after Telltale itself sadly closed down.

                              <span>One of Elden Ring&#x27;s most difficult bosses has now been made even trickier.


It&#x27;s thanks to a bug in the latest update that causes the infamous Malenia to self-heal when other players are summoned in to help.


The bug was spotted by the now legendary player Let Me Solo Her, who regularly leaves a summon sign outside the boss fight to help those struggling to defeat her.

                              <span>Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series, Bandai Namco-s two-game remaster of the much-loved Klonoa series, will be heading to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 8th July, arriving alongside the previously announced Switch version.


Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series features HD remasters of Klonoa: Door to Phantomile, first released on PlayStation 1 in 1997 and celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, plus its 2001 PlayStation 2 sequel Klonoa 2: Lunatea’s Veil, both in the same package.


Both games, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, play out as side-scrolling platformers in which protatongist Klonoa, a Dream Traveler (and be-hatted rabbit thing), embarks on an adventure to save their respective worlds.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been an eventful day for long-starved Skate fans; not only did footage from the series&#x27; upcoming fourth instalment leak its way onto the internet, additional details have begun to emerge, with a new report suggesting Skate 4 will let players build skateparks together in free skate mode as part of an emphasis on user-generated content.


That&#x27;s according to the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb, who shared some fresh Skate 4 morsals from his sources during the most recent episode of his Giant Bomb show Grubbsnax. As transcribed by VGC, Grubb began by saying early word on the game appeared to be positive, with those who&#x27;ve played it being &quot;very impressed with the way it feels.&quot;


According to Grubb, EA&#x27;s goal with Skate 4 is to modernise the series while retaining its much-loved skating core, with some of the new features said to be akin to those seen in the likes of Forza or other modern multiplayer games. These reportedly includes ample customisation options for characters - &quot;a lot of skins, skins for your board, things like that&quot;, Grubb explained - as well as user-generated content, which Skate 4 will &quot;really emphasise&quot;.

                              <span>Sci-fi grand strategy game Stellaris&#x27; new Overlord expansion has been given a release date and will be making its way to PC on 12th May, arriving alongside a free update for all players.


Overlord is Stellaris&#x27; sixth major expansion (following on from Nemesis, Federations, MegaCorp, Apocalypse, and Utopia), and brings a range of new options for players as they spread their influence among the stars, this time loosely focussed on empire management.


There are, for instance, new vassalisation mechanics, enabling players to negotiate or demand the terms of their agreements with their new vassals, or even define the specialist role they&#x27;ll play in an empire - either focusing on military might, tech research, or economic acquisition.
