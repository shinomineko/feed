Introduction
Are you interested in learning about what SIG Usability does and how you can get involved? Well, you&#x27;re at the right place. SIG Usability is all about making Kubernetes more accessible to new folks, and its main activity is conducting user research for the community. In this blog, we have summarized our conversation with Gaby Moreno, who walks us through the various aspects of being a part of the SIG and shares some insights about how others can get involved.
Gaby is a co-lead for SIG Usability. She works as a Product Designer at IBM and enjoys working on the user experience of open, hybrid cloud technologies like Kubernetes, OpenShift, Terraform, and Cloud Foundry.

                    <span>After a year of research, Pokémon Go fans have uncovered a hidden mechanic involved in catching creatures from raid battles.
The research, published today by fan resource The Silph Road, appears to show a secret modifier that boosts the likelihood of catching a raid boss over the course of an encounter.
Simply put, the longer it takes you to catch a boss, the more likely it becomes that your next Premier Ball throw will actually do so. Or, as The Silph Road reports: &quot;You are more likely to catch the raid boss on the 10th throw of the encounter than on your first.&quot;

                    <span>Raven has teased some upcoming changes to Call of Duty: Warzone in the latest patch notes for the battle royale.
The developer plans to update the High Alert perk to let players hear Dead Silent footsteps. Currently, all High Alert does is make your vision pulse whenever enemies outside of your view see you. By then, of course, it&#x27;s often too late.
This change to High Alert is important for anyone who plays Warzone - a game in which your ability to hear your enemy coming can make the difference between winning and losing a gunfight.

Download the game and log in anytime before 31st August and you also gain access to the Mythical Pokémon Zeraora.
As previously announced, Pokémon Unite&#x27;s mobile version then launches at some point in September (and there will be a way for mobile players to get Zeraora then as well).

Redditor Joslatt1 took to the Black Ops Cold War subreddit to report the new support, which other players have subsequently confirmed. There&#x27;s even a toggle in the menu for &#x27;trigger haptics&#x27;.

                    <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick is all wrapped up, but if you&#x27;re looking for another exciting speedrun to watch, this world record-breaking blindfolded Super Mario Bros. run seems like a good place to start. 
Speedrunner Crescendo posted a video of the world record run last night, with the timer showing that he managed to beat the game in 11 minutes and 55 seconds. It appears the previous record was held by speedrunner dodai, who achieved a time of 14 minutes and 46 seconds back in 2016. 
This all sounds impressive on paper, but the run itself makes for remarkable viewing: at one point Crescendo has to accurately count down the seconds needed to run a sufficient distance before making a series of perfect jumps. He uses fireballs as an echolocation device, and is able to figure out his surroundings from the noise they make when hitting a wall. He also seems to break bricks to figure out his position.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone&#x27;s new Season Four Reloaded update is the &quot;first major step&quot; towards increasing the game&#x27;s average time-to-kill, developer Raven has said.
Raven has talked about making it so it takes longer to kill an enemy in Warzone for some time now.
This morning, a sweeping weapon balance pass, which Raven called &quot;the biggest balance update in the history of Warzone&quot;, has seen some weapons heavily nerfed. Guns such as the SCAR, Oden, both AK-47s and the FAL all took a hit, with a particular focus on reducing torso multipliers.

                    <span>Resident Evil Re:Verse, the multiplayer component for this year&#x27;s Resident Evil Village, will now launch in 2022. 
Re:Verse had been given a vague July launch window, after previously being delayed from launching alongside Village back in May.
This latest setback, of at least six months, is the most major yet - though it doesn&#x27;t come as too much of a surprise. Fan response to Re:Verse&#x27;s beta was mixed to say the least, and Capcom said today it needed more time &quot;to deliver a smooth gameplay experience&quot;.

Don&#x27;t expect any differences, outside of the box and cartridge. Nintendo has also yet to set a price, though in the US the digital and physical versions are sold for the same amount.

                    <span>Minecraft maker Mojang has released a new Caves and Cliffs test live for PC, and fans are seriously impressed by the changes it makes.
The 1.18 experimental snapshot allows for some truly spectacular world generation, including realistic-looking mountain peaks and Mines of Moria-like cave structures. 
The only thing which disappointed me was these &quot;cheese&quot;, &quot;spaghetti&quot; and &quot;noodle&quot; caves were not actually places you could mine out Italian foodstuffs. (Those names simply reflect the holey or elongated shapes created by the snapshot&#x27;s cave generation algorithm.)

                    <span>YouTube is getting several new live-streaming features today, and they may seem rather familiar, as all three of them have been popular features on Twitch for some time. 
As spotted by The Verge, YouTube streamers will now be able to create polls inside their chats, and limit the chats to subscribers-only. Viewers will now also be able to create clips of streams. 
Although the features are hardly the most original, they should give YouTube streamers a little more control over their communities. The subscribers-only chat option is a useful way to moderate discussion and discourage any unwelcome drive-by comments from new viewers. Polls provide another way for viewers to stay engaged with the action - and are a handy tool for streamers looking to find out what their community wants to watch next.

The streaming giant has now hired former EA, Oculus and Zynga exec Mike Verdu as vice president of game development, Bloomberg has reported, and is set to add its first games to its subscription offering within the year.
There&#x27;s no detail yet on what the mix of games will look like, to what extent Netflix will make its own original games, or whether any big franchises you&#x27;ve already heard of will be part of the plans.

As the Kubernetes API evolves, APIs are periodically reorganized or upgraded.
When APIs evolve, the old APIs they replace are deprecated, and eventually removed.
See Kubernetes API removals to read more about Kubernetes&#x27;
policy on removing APIs.
We want to make sure you&#x27;re aware of some upcoming removals. These are
beta APIs that you can use in current, supported Kubernetes versions,
and they are already deprecated. The reason for all of these removals
is that they have been superseded by a newer, stable (“GA”) API.
Kubernetes 1.22, due for release in August 2021, will remove a number of deprecated
APIs.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 will feature cross-play between PC and console players, with some limitations and opt-outs.
PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners will all be able to play together, with the option to opt-out of mixing PC and console groups if you so choose.
Separately, PS4 and Xbox One console players can also play together, but separate from other platforms. This makes sense, considering last-gen platforms feature 64 instead of 128-player matches.

                    <span>Rockstar has dropped Red Dead Online&#x27;s PlayStation Plus requirement for two weeks to coincide with the release of its new Blood Money update.
PlayStation players can play Red Dead Online without a PlayStation Plus subscription from 13th to 26th July, Rockstar said. It costs £17.99 from the PlayStation Store.
Red Dead Online currently requires Xbox Live Gold to play, but it&#x27;s worth noting it&#x27;s included with Xbox Game Pass.

                    <span>The recent story surrounding the notion of a pirate, DRM-free &#x27;cracked&#x27; version of Resident Evil Village out-performing Capcom&#x27;s launch code had me in turns fascinated and horrified. I can accept that anti-piracy measures are a necessity, and I can equally accept that their sophistication these days may have a certain level of CPU overhead. However, putting out a game that has performance issues because of the DRM crosses a red line - it&#x27;s something that a developer or publisher absolutely should not do. And yet, I can confirm that Resident Evil Village on PC in its cracked form does run smoother than the flawed official release.
In fact, the compromised code addresses the two key performance issues my colleague Alex Battaglia noted in his Resident Evil Village PC tech review. Firstly, key…</span>

For individual games, there&#x27;s a new 85 percent revenue split for titles sold after 1st October up until the end of 2023, and up until the first $3m earned. This is similar to both Google and Apple&#x27;s app store policies, which also take just 15 percent of the revenue cut compared to the industry standard 30 percent, up to a certain threshold.

                    <span>Remember that Bloodborne PSone demake project that imagined what the game would look like if it had been transported back through the console generations? Well, the team has provided us with another update video to show their progress, and they&#x27;ve now managed to recreate an entire PSone-style boss fight in Unreal Engine 4. 
Developer Lilith Walther, who&#x27;s an Unreal Engine 4 tech artist and also lead programmer on indie JRPG Witch, shared a video of the boss fight on Twitter. It shows the player taking on Father Gascoigne, and features cutscenes, destructible gravestones and music produced on a Roland SC-88 for &quot;maximum authenticity&quot;. You can take a look at the full video below:  
It&#x27;s seriously impressive work, and personally I think the atmosphere in the &quot;PSone&quot; version feels even spookier than in the original game. The comparison video showing the same cutscene in Bloodborne and the demake is also well worth a watch:

                    <span>Originally filed in 2019, the patent was picked up by Tencent last week and spotted by video games analyst Daniel Ahmad.
&quot;[It] relates to the inheritance of digital items and assets after a person passes away,&quot; Ahmad wrote. &quot;While not fully related to video games, it has sparked discussions online about game accounts / virtual item inheritance.&quot;

                    <span>Ever wondered what a stroll around the magnificent decks of the Titanic would feel like? As ever... there&#x27;s a mod for that. 
The Titanic Mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven aims to do exactly what it says on the tin, which is to put the RMS Titanic in Mafia. This isn&#x27;t just any old 3D model seen from a distance, however - the mod team is trying to make &quot;one of the most detailed and accurate free 3D recreations of the Titanic ever made&quot;. Players will be able to explore the ship in freeroam mode, and the work done so far really does look stunning:
On top of all that, the mod even comes with its own storyline. It promises fully voice-acted missions, complete with cutscenes and a new soundtrack.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&#x27;s hidden nuke scorestreak has expanded to the rest of multiplayer, Treyarch has announced.
The nuke scorestreak that was only available in Cranked Hardpoint mode is now available in all multiplayer modes except League Play and CDL variants, Multi-Team, party games and Gunfight.
Treyarch first added the nuke scorestreak to Black Ops Cold War without an announcement in May, during season three, to the Cranked Hardpoint mode. It was the first time a Treyarch Call of Duty had the nuke scorestreak.

You can set a spending limit by manually adding money to their Microsoft account and removing the ability to purchase with a credit or debit card. 
You can also toggle an &quot;Ask to Buy&quot; function if a child account wants to make a purchase they don&#x27;t have sufficient funds for, prompting a request to either make the purchase for the child or add funds to do so.

                    <span>The maker of a machine learning cheat that hit the headlines last week has insisted &quot;my intent was never to do anything illegal&quot; after Activision stepped in to shut development down.
The creator of the cheat, who goes by the name &quot;USER101&quot;, has slapped a statement on the website for User Vision Pro, which Activision took steps to scrub from the internet after console competitive multiplayer fans expressed concern about its potential to ruin games.
A new version of existing cheat User Vision Pro was set to use machine learning to analyse gameplay footage in real-time before sending inputs to a controller.

                    <span>If Nintendo and Nickelodeon got in a fight and that fight was turned into a video game but without any Nintendo characters, well that&#x27;s Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl.
It&#x27;s the latest take on the Super Smash Bros style of fighting games, this time filled with classic cartoon characters. 
Nigel Thornberry, Spongebob and Patrick, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Helga from Hey Arnold!, Reptar from Rugrats and Powdered Toast Man from Ren &amp; Stimpy have all been pulled out of Nickelodeon&#x27;s vault for the occasion.

                    <span>China is making sure that all newly discovered zero-day exploits are disclosed to the government.
Under the new rules, anyone in China who finds a vulnerability must tell the government, which will decide what repairs to make. No information can be given to “overseas organizations or individuals” other than the product’s manufacturer.
No one may “collect, sell or publish information on network product security vulnerabilities,” say the rules issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China and the police and industry ministries.

This just blocks the cyber-arms trade. It doesn’t prevent researchers from telling the products’ companies, even if they are outside of China...</span>

                    <span>In a surprising twist on the normal Call of Duty: Warzone cheating issues that have plagued the battle royale since launch, hackers appear to be boosting high-profile streamers&#x27; accounts to level 1000 and unlocking their weapon camos.
A raft of popular Warzone streamers were shocked to see their accounts hit the maximum level 1000 while playing last night, and all Black Ops Cold War weapons in the game hit maximum level, complete with all camos unlocked.
Yes, even the incredibly difficult to obtain Dark Matter camos for these weapons were unlocked.

                    <span>PUBG Mobile really has been through the wringer in India: its popularity in the country led to concerns that children were spending too long playing the game, and several Indian cities placed bans on the game in 2019 after blaming it for promoting violent behaviour. Then, in 2020, PUBG Mobile was banned across the entire country following increased tensions between China and India. As the game was published by Chinese company Tencent, PUBG Mobile was included in the list of 118 apps banned in India over security concerns. 
But it seems PUBG Corp wasn&#x27;t quite ready to give up, and a new version of the game is already seeing massive success. 
Battlegrounds Mobile India is the new (but still not particularly catchy) name of PUBG Mobile in India, and it&#x27;s off to a roaring start. The game launched on 2nd July, and now has 34 million registered players, 16m daily active users, and a peak concurrent player count of 2.4 million. And apparently it&#x27;s not even on the Apple App Store yet (via Times of India).

                    <span>PlayStation 5 timed-exclusive Ghostwire: Tokyo will now launch in &quot;early 2022&quot;, developer Tango Gameworks has announced.
The delay will allow the studio to finish the project while protecting the health of staff at the studio, Tango said in a statement issued via Twitter today.
Ghostwire: Tokyo was previously set to launch for PS5 and PC this October, with a year&#x27;s console exclusivity before arriving on Xbox - despite the fact Tango&#x27;s parent company Bethesda is now part of Microsoft.

                    <span>The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection PC port now has some graphics options.
The collection launched last month and was immediately found wanting, with severely limited customisation and graphics options.
To play in fullscreen mode you had to launch the game and then click the maximise icon in the upper-right of the title bar. At launch the game started in windowed mode every time.

                    <span>Frontier Developments has delayed Elite Dangerous&#x27; Odyssey update on consoles indefinitely to focus on fixing the PC version.
In a post on the Frontier forum, chief David Braben said the studio accepts the &quot;frustration&quot; players have had with the Odyssey expansion since it came out in May.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched, quickly accruing a &#x27;Mostly Negative&#x27; rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.

                    <span>Surprise! Lighting Returns: Final Fantasy 13 just got a surprise patch five years after the game came out on PC.
Square Enix&#x27;s role-playing adventure, which launched on PC in December 2015, received an update to fix an issue with Lightning&#x27;s voice not being played in some scenes, according to a note on Steam.
How random! Or is it? As many fans have already speculated, this update may be more about tidying up the game ahead of a launch into Xbox Game Pass.

It&#x27;s called Payload, and it arrives as part of the Season Four Reloaded refresh, which kicks off 5am UK time this Thursday, 15th July.
Payload is inspired by Call of Duty: WW2&#x27;s War Mode (a mode I very much enjoyed), Activision said in a blog post. In it, two teams of 20 players fight against each other in a race against time to obtain intel from vehicles that are carrying satellite parts.

                    <span>Respawn has been battling hackers in its online games for some time, but the situation escalated recently when hackers blocked players from accessing Apex Legends in order to complain about hacking in Titanfall. And unfortunately it seems the saga is having an impact on Respawn&#x27;s development plans, with work on at least one highly-anticipated feature for Apex Legends, cross-progression, slowed by the recent spate of attacks.  
Earlier this week Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier responded to a question about cross-progression on Twitter, explaining that &quot;recent hacks on Apex and TF have slowed down the progress of it&quot;. He added that the studio needed to &quot;context switch to solving live game issues&quot;. 
Although cross-platform play was implemented in Apex Legends last year, players have so far been unable to transfer progress between accounts on different platforms (aside from moving between Steam and Origin). It&#x27;s a feature the team seems eager to introduce, with Grenier explaining via Reddit that implementing it will be &quot;much harder post-launch since users may have multiple accounts to merge or use&quot;. Given the ongoing problems with hacking in Apex Legends and the Titanfall games, it sounds like it could be a little while longer before we see this feature implemented.

LeBron James&#x27; appearance is timed alongside this week&#x27;s release of Space Jam: A New Legacy, the live action and animated Looney Tunes film sequel in which he stars.
There will be two LeBron skins - Majesty, which reflects his King nickname, and one with Tune Squad and Casual styles, reflecting his Space Jam outfit and... I guess how he hangs out at home in shorts.

                    <span>Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima has said he doesn&#x27;t like the name of his expanded Death Stranding: Director&#x27;s Cut. 
In a series of tweets this morning, Kojima compared the typical use of the term Director&#x27;s Cut in the movie business, and what had happened here. 
Kojima&#x27;s reasoning is the PlayStation 5 version&#x27;s new features were all developed after the original Death Stranding released, rather than it being a new version of the game assembled from cut content.

                    <span>EA is facing a backlash over its decision to make FIFA 22 on PC the last-gen version of the game.
Fans have criticised the move, which was confirmed last night when EA unveiled the game alongside its debut trailer, below.
FIFA 22 has what EA calls &quot;HyperMotion&quot; gameplay, which combines machine learning with 11v11 motion capture to improve how players move during a match.

                    <span>After a week of weird and wonderful speedruns, this year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick event came to an end on Sunday - with a total of $2.8m (£2m) raised for charity. 
This year the online speedrunning event was raising money for Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), a charity that provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disasters, epidemics or exclusion from healthcare. The donations from the latest event mean that Games Done Quick has now raised over $34m (£24.5m) for charity in total. 
As you may have noticed from Twitter, one of the highlights of this year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick was a GeoGuessr speedrun, in which player Havrd managed to figure out his locations with remarkable accuracy. The Pokémon Black and White any percentage race between PulseEffects and Swiftalu, meanwhile, came down to the last five seconds. You can check out both of these highly entertaining speed runs below - or check out the full catalogue of runs on GDQ&#x27;s YouTube channel.

                    <span>EA has changed the way its dual entitlement program works for FIFA 22 so that the next-gen upgrade is only available to those who fork out £89.99 for the Ultimate Edition.
EA unveiled FIFA 22 on Sunday with a 1st October release date and debut trailer, below, and with the announcement came confirmation that only those who buy the digital-only Ultimate Edition get both the last-gen and current-gen versions of the game.
This is a marked change compared to the dual entitlement program for FIFA 21, which offered a free next-gen upgrade to owners of all versions on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

                    <span>A pristine sealed copy of Super Mario 64 has sold for $1.56m (£1.12m), setting a record for the highest amount anyone has paid for a video game at auction. 
Heritage Auctions, which handled the sale, has shifted numerous rare games in the past, but nothing with a price close to this.
Still, interest in rare or vintage video games is on the rise. The previous record was set only last week, for an unopened NES copy of the original Legend of Zelda. That went for $878k (£633k).

While not yet formally announced by developer/publisher Square Enix, Wario64 spotted the listing for The Ultimate Final Fantasy 14 Cookbook on the Simon &amp; Schuster website and was able to cross reference it with another listing that had popped up on Amazon (thanks, Siliconera).
While the former scrambled to rename the listing as &quot;Licensed Video Game Cookbook&quot;, it wasn&#x27;t changed in time to prevent Wario64 from snapping a screenshot of the Insights Editions book and details on its contents.

&quot;All people should be able to enjoy games,&quot; a later tweet insisted (thanks, TheGamer). &quot;All ages, all possible needs. It&#x27;s an ongoing and important process for our industry and a challenge we need to me[e]t.

                    <span>Bloober Team has responded to fan speculation that its new partnership with Konami could mean there&#x27;s a new Silent Hill game on the way.
Following the recent discovery of EU funding applications from the studio for a number of codenamed projects - including H2O, Black, and Dum Spiro - fans are speculating that either one of the latter two games could be related to Silent Hill.
Bloober CMO Tomasz Gawlikowski, however, has clarified that the scope of these projects have changed considerably since the funding applications were filed.

The exploit is particularly egregious given the opposing player is unable to damage the invincible interloper at all. Check out the brief video below to see how it works in action:
Right now the YouTuber who first publicised the exploit has refrained from explaining how it can be done, but has teased in their comment section that they will &quot;post how to do it in a couple [of] days&quot;.

                    <span>Unhappy Resident Evil Village players are blaming DRM for the game&#x27;s poor performance on PC. 
&quot;All in-game shutters like the one from when you kill a zombie are fixed because Capcom DRM&#x27;s entry points are patched out so most of their functions are never executed anymore,&quot; explained hacker Empress, who claims playing a pirated version of the game without Capcom&#x27;s anti-tamper V3 and Denuvo V11 &quot;results in [a] much smoother game experience&quot;.
DSO Gaming tested the theory for themselves and played a two-hour snippet of a cracked version. Despite killing numerous enemies, they said they &quot;did not get a single stutter during these two hours&quot;.

                    <span>Washington D.C. and 36 states have filed a lawsuit against Google for alleged antitrust practices.
As reported by Politico (thanks, TheGamer), the lawsuit - which was filed on Wednesday, 7th July 2021 in California and led by Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah - reportedly challenges the megacorp&#x27;s control of the Android app store.
The filing takes umbrage with Google&#x27;s plans to take a 30 per cent cut of all digital goods and services sold via its Play Store from September and is just one of several ongoing litigation battles taken out against the company over Google&#x27;s perceived search engine and advertising monopolies.

A modder known as Zel is spearheading the effort, whichuses the Zelda &#x27;97 &quot;overdump&quot; as well as data from the infamous Nintendo &quot;gigaleak&quot; of July 2020.

In conversation with Nier chief Yoko Taro during a special Final Fantasy 14 livestream, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida indicated the hotly-anticipated game will skip this year&#x27;s TGS, which kicks off at the end of September.
In comments translated by Twitter user @aitaikimochi and Siliconera, Yoshida said the team wants to show Final Fantasy 16 shortly before the game launches, rather than drip feed fans snippets of information over a long period of time.

That figure comfortably beats the previous world record price for a video game, set by an unopened copy of Super Mario Bros. that went for $660,000 earlier this year.
Dallas, Texas-based Heritage Auctions said this cart is an early production copy of the first game in the Zelda series, and &quot;is no doubt the apotheosis of rarity, cultural significance, and collection centerpieces&quot;.

                    <span>Following its entirely underwhelming first footage reveal of The Witcher TV show&#x27;s second season earlier this year (all 12 seconds of it), Netflix has finally shared a first proper trailer for Season 2 as its newly confirmed 17th December release draws nearer. And here it is now!
As part of tonight&#x27;s WitcherCon, a livestream collaboration between CD Projekt and Netflix, the streaming service has announced that the long-awaited second season of its live-action Witcher TV series will arrive on 17th December this year.
That means fans will have been waiting almost exactly two years by the time Season 2 arrives (its predecessor debuted in December 2019), with the long gap between seasons largely the result of coronavirus-related filming delays. With filming wrapped and post-production now well underway, though, Netflix is finally ready to talk specifics and has confirmed Season 2 will once again consist of eight episodes, all of which have now had their official names revealed.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s animated Witcher movie, Nightmare of the Wolf, will officially arrive on 23rd August, and there&#x27;s a first look at its action in a new teaser trailer to celebrate the news.
Announced back at the start of last year, Nightmare of the Wolf focusses on Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s friend and mentor Vesemir, and is set &quot;long before&quot; the two meet. In fact, previous word from Netflix suggests it&#x27;ll wind the action all the way back to the start of Vesemir&#x27;s journey as a Witcher, &quot;after the mysterious Deglan claims him through the Law of Surprise&quot;.
And if that&#x27;s left you sufficiently intrigued, you can see Netflix&#x27;s first teaser trailer for Nightmare of the Wolf below. Animation is being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind Legend of Korra - while Lauren S. Hissrich and Beau DeMayo, respectively showrunner and writer on the main live-action Witcher series, are both involved.

                    <span>A video game collector has come across what is believed to be evidence of the &quot;SNK Millennium&quot; console - 20 years after it was rumoured to be in the works.
Anthony Bacon, from Chicago (who we&#x27;ve featured multiple times on Eurogamer before), was sent a mystery SNK motherboard earlier this year and asked to investigate by its owner.
This board had a long journey to Bacon&#x27;s desk. His friend, Brian Hargrove, bought a lot of SNK motherboards from Yahoo Auctions Japan 15 years ago, not having any idea what they were. He sold the board in question to a friend of his called Max, who five months ago contacted Bacon to ask if he could work out what it was.

                    <span>Snowman and Land &amp; Sea has announced that Alto&#x27;s Odyssey, the endless sand-surfing game from 2018, is getting a special edition. Alto&#x27;s Odyssey: The Lost City comes to Apple Arcade on 16th July.
The Lost City is a sort of revisiting of the original game, allowing players to &quot;venture deeper into the endless desert to uncover its best-kept secret.&quot; The game adds a new biome - the Lost city - and expands upon the original design with new secrets and challenges. The idea is to give returning players something fresh to tease at, while allowing new players to see what the game&#x27;s all about in the first place.
The teaser trailer promises lavish mystery and paper lanterns - always a lovely mix. If you have played the original game, your save data will carry across too, which is pretty great. Can&#x27;t wait for this one.

                    <span>After launching in April with several serious bugs, Oddworld: Soulstorm is now in a place creator Lorne Lanning has said he is proud of. 
In a message to fans, Lanning today thanked the Oddworld series&#x27; community for their feedback and patience while the latest game in the series was improved. 
Now, seven updates later, Soulstorm stands &quot;refined&quot;, Lanning said. &quot;Major fixes&quot; include updates to Abe&#x27;s movement, aim, and stealth. Enemy AI has been improved, and several levels have been rebalanced. The game&#x27;s PlayStation 5 trophies have been rejigged, and DualSense support now extends to being able to feel Abe&#x27;s heartbeat at times of stress.

                    <span>Sony has removed a PlayStation 5 advert which showed the console placed upside down.
Fans spotted the incorrectly-positioned PS5 in the video yesterday, posted to Twitter. Overnight, the advert was quietly deleted from the internet.
The heartwarming ad began with a dad telling his son a bedtime story. Thinking of his current God of War playthrough, the dad starts telling his son a tale of how a father and son went for a walk in the mountains. The cherubic child quickly falls asleep.

                    <span>Arkane Studios, the developer behind the likes of Dishonored and Prey, has been teasing Deathloop for quite some time now, and the wonderfully stylish recursive stealth shooter has looked captivating at every turn. And the tantalising glimpses continued tonight with nine new minutes of gameplay footage, as shown during Sony&#x27;s latest PlayStation State of Play.
First, the basic premise for those unfamiliar; in Deathloop, players take on the role of Colt, an assassin who finds himself trapped in an endless time loop on the mysterious Blackreef island. In order to escape, he&#x27;ll need to take out eight targets known as the Visionaries before the day ends - but if he fails (or dies) time rewinds and he&#x27;ll need to start over.
All isn&#x27;t lost, however; by exploring further in each successive loop, players can gain valuable clues they&#x27;ll be able to use next time around to locate and eliminate their targets before the day ends - and Arkane&#x27;s latest gameplay footage focusses on an attempt to bring down the Visionary known as Aleksis &quot;The Wolf&quot; Dorsey.

                    <span>Sony has now shown a chunk of gameplay footage from Death Stranding: Director&#x27;s Cut, which launches on 24th September. 
This expanded version of Hideo Kojima&#x27;s oddball post-apocalyptic courier adventure adds new story missions, new combat mechanics, a firing range and... a racing mode.
Combat has been expanded with upgraded melee attacks, a laser gun and mounted machine guns. There&#x27;s also a cargo gun that launches packages over long distances, a support skeleton to let you carry even more, and a cute buddy bot who can carry loads and run alongside you.

                    <span>Developer Megagon Industries&#x27; wonderfully serene (and deliciously infuriating) mountain bike adventure Lonely Mountains: Downhill is a brilliant thing, but given that it&#x27;s also a year and a half old now, fans may be hoping for a bit of a shake-up. And what do you know? Megagon&#x27;s newest update is here to do just that, wafting away the threat of encroaching staleness with a range of new Daily Ride challenge modifiers.
Daily Rides, if you&#x27;ve not yet checked them out, are daily cross-platform leaderboards that challenge players to do their best in a randomly selected trial, with participants able to unlock various cosmetic rewards, refreshed each season, along the way. Today&#x27;s update marks the start of Lonely Mountains&#x27; seventh season, Summer Strolls, and introduces those aforementioned modifiers to freshen things up for players.
Today&#x27;s Daily Ride, for instance, rolls out the new Changed Checkpoints modifier - which, as its name suggests, changes and adds new checkpoints to the trail - but future modifiers for the season have also been revealed (and you can see a few of them in the trailer below).

                    <span>Rockstar has started removing GTA Online jobs.
Rockstar warned jobs such as races, missions, adversary modes and survivals will be cycled in and out over time as they add more to the game.
We&#x27;ve verified the Bombushka Run Adversary Mode is currently not in GTA Online. Bombushka Run was added to GTA Online as part of the continuation of the Smuggler&#x27;s Run update in September 2017.

This Time It&#x27;s Virtual (Sam &amp; Max&#x27;s first entirely new video game outing since Telltale Games&#x27; The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse in 2010) is the work of developer HappyGiant, which promisingly includes Sam &amp; Max creator Steve Purcell and a number of ex-LucasArts alumni who all worked on the studio&#x27;s seminal 1993 point-and-click adventure Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road - writer/designer Mike Stemmle, creative director Mike Levine, and concept artist Peter Chan.
Additionally, David Nowlin and Dave Boat, who&#x27;ve voiced Sam and Max previously in a number of Telltale titles, are reprising their roles as the dubious dog and bunny duo.

Neither Guilty Gear Strive publisher Bandai Namco nor developer Arc System Works have commented, despite repeated requests from Eurogamer.

The in-development cheat, brought to light by the Anti-Cheat Police Department Twitter account this week, claims to use machine learning to analyse gameplay footage in real-time before sending inputs to your controller.
Eurogamer will not disclose the name of the cheat or publish the original video.

The Los Angeles-based studio has previously assisted DICE on its Battlefield series, and is doing so again with the upcoming Battlefield 2042 - more on that below.
But Ripple Effect Studios is also now creating its own new project, after Vince Zampella, boss of Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order developer Respawn Entertainment, took on an expanded role in January as &quot;head coach&quot; of the now-renamed team.

That&#x27;s a steady uptick from the last couple of sales milestones announced by the publisher - 3m at launch in May, then up to 4m after 20 days. 
Village&#x27;s predecessor Resident Evil 7 has shifted 9m copies since its launch in 2017, though only sold 3.5m after nine weeks. Village is selling faster, then, and looks on track to potentially overtake 7 as the biggest-selling entry in the series.

                    <span>Among Us&#x27; new Irish localisation has been described as &quot;a cultural win for a thriving minority language&quot; by one of the people who worked on it.
The monster hit game received a new update yesterday, and with it brought Irish localisation. Among Us is perhaps the biggest game ever to receive an Irish localisation, although it is not the first.
&quot;It&#x27;s a MASSIVE win for a minority language and one of many I hope!&quot; Úna-Minh Kavanagh, who spearheaded the project, said in a post on Twitter.

                    <span>Dark Souls 3 has just received a new lease of life on Xbox Series consoles, thanks to the transformative powers of FPS Boost. The From Software classic now targets 60 frames per second on the new wave of Microsoft consoles, replacing the somewhat wobbly 30fps of the Xbox One rendition of the game. We had early access to the FPS Boosted rendition of the game and it certainly does the job, delivering nigh-on flawless performance on Xbox Series consoles.
This is a much-requested upgrade for Xbox Series X and S owners, bringing the game closer into line with its performance profile on PS5. Dark Souls 3 released on last-gen systems in 2016 with a firm 30fps cap, but many months later, a PlayStation 4 Pro patch removed the limit, offering frame-rates up to 60fps. Unfortunately, the value of the upgrade was questionable at the time, owing to a highly variable level of performance on Sony&#x27;s enhanced machine. However, in the long run, it worked out - PlayStation 5&#x27;s backwards compatibility horsepower locks the game to 1080p60.
Unfortunately, From Software never went back to the Xbox One version of Dark Souls 3 to add One X support, meaning that 900p30 has been the upper limit of performance on Xbox consoles since the game&#x27;s original launch. Not only that, in common with From&#x27;s other 30fps console offerings, inconsistent frame-pacing added a certain degree of judder to the game, something baked into the engine that extra back-compat horsepower could not address. Today&#x27;s FPS Boost upgrade overrides the frame-rate cap to give Xbox Series X and S the same, smooth experience 60fps as PS5, with no judder, hitches or stuttering.

                    <span>ArsTechnica has a good story on the REvil ransomware attack of last weekend, with technical details:
This weekend’s attack was carried out with almost surgical precision. According to Cybereason, the REvil affiliates first gained access to targeted environments and then used the zero-day in the Kaseya Agent Monitor to gain administrative control over the target’s network. After writing a base-64-encoded payload to a file named agent.crt the dropper executed it.
[…]
The ransomware dropper Agent.exe is signed with a Windows-trusted certificate that uses the registrant name “PB03 TRANSPORT LTD.” By digitally signing their malware, attackers are able to suppress many security warnings that would otherwise appear when it’s being installed. Cybereason said that the certificate appears to have been used exclusively by REvil malware that was deployed during this attack...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait, but console fans of 11 Bit Studios&#x27; celebrated post-apocalyptic city builder Frostpunk will finally be able to get their hands on Xbox and Playstation versions of the game&#x27;s three expansions from Wednesday, 26th June. 
Frostpunk launched on consoles toward the end of 2019, introducing its narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder - in which players must overcome gruelling conditions to keep their fledgling community alive in a desolate sub-zero world - to a legion of new fans.
Since then, three distinctive expansions have released on PC, building upon Frostpunk&#x27;s punishing but wonderfully compelling core in interesting new ways, and it&#x27;s these that will finally debut on consoles later this month.

                    <span>Switch owners with a taste for cracking yarns, urban fantasy, and a smattering of demonic possession have a bit of a treat in store; developer Wadjet Eye&#x27;s superb point-and-click adventure Unavowed is available on Nintendo&#x27;s platform from today.
Unavowed - which is the work of Dave Gilbert, the designer behind Wadjet Eye&#x27;s renowned Blackwell series - was enormously well-received when it released on PC back in 2018, receiving much acclaim for its ambitious structure and wonderfully compelling storyline.
It sees players taking on the role of a (somewhat definable) character who&#x27;s spent the last year terrorising New York City in a demonically possessed frenzy - and who now, after intervention from a crack team of supernatural specialists, finds themselves in the employ of an ancient, evil-battling secret society and ready to put their recent mistakes right.

                    <span>Konami has cancelled its contract with Antoine Griezmann after a video in which the France and Barcelona star appears to ridicule Asian hotel staff resurfaced this week.
The Snapchat video, which appears to show Griezmann as well as teammate Ousmane Dembele mocking Asian technicians during Barcelona&#x27;s tour of Japan in 2019, has sparked a vociferous backlash amid racism allegations.
According to ESPN, in the video Dembele says to Griezmann: &quot;All these ugly faces, just so you can play PES, aren&#x27;t you ashamed?&quot;

                    <span>A popular third-party Call of Duty: Warzone stats tracker app is back online after its creators held successful talks with Activision.
Warzone Tracker was one of a number of overlay apps on the Overwolf network that were disabled earlier this year following an update to the battle royale.
This update, issued in response to an Activision API terms of service breach by a separate app on the Overwolf framework, had the knock-on effect of blocking Overwolf entirely, preventing its use while the PC version of Warzone was in use.

The lengthy blog post contains mention of two teams led by two creative directors. Clint Hocking, formerly of Splinter Cell and Watch Dogs Legion, will lead a team at Ubisoft Montreal. Jonathan Dumont, a veteran of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate and Odyssey, will lead a team at Ubisoft Quebec.
The Infinity project that will include the games made by both these teams will be led by Marc-Alexis Côté, who will now serve as executive producer of the entire Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise. Côté worked on Brotherhood before becoming creative director on Syndicate, and is one of the most senior staff at Ubisoft Quebec.

EA told GamesIndustry.biz the pair&#x27;s departure has &quot;always been part of the plan&quot;, but was brought forward due to the speed of Codies&#x27; integration into EA.
F1 developer Codemasters and Project Cars developer Slight Mad, which Codies bought in November 2019, are being made a part of EA Sports, which is publishing F1 2021 next week.

The video, below, shows off Gollum doing stealthy climby bits and bobs as we&#x27;ve seen him do before in previous trailers, but in a few new environments such as Mirkwood.
We then see the Lieutenant of Barad-dûr, aka Mouth of Sauron, for the first time:

                    <span>I once said that AWS has launched so many services that I could talk about a service that didn&#x27;t really exist and not get called out for it–by AWS employees. Sure enough, last week saw the rise of AWS Infinidash, an imaginary AWS service that doesn&#x27;t (at the time of this writing) really exist.

                    <span>Publisher Nacon has delayed the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong. Originally scheduled to arrive this year, the narrative RPG is now due to launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and PC in February 2022.
Swansong, which was announced back in 2019, is the work of Big Bad Wolf, the studio behind episodic adventure game The Council, and places players into the shoes of three different vampires, each belonging to a different clan within the vampire sect of The Camarilla.
&quot;Weaving between their intertwined tales,&quot; Nacon explained at the time of Swansong&#x27;s reveal, &quot;the player has to confront the different points of view of his characters to unravel fact from fiction. With whispers of conspiracy, murder and power struggles, the player must protect his clan, discover the truth and above all enforce the Masquerade, the vampire law designed to conceal the existence of creatures of the night from humans.&quot;

                    <span>Spiders - the French studio behind the scrappy but lovable RPG likes of GreedFall and The Technomacer - has shared first gameplay footage of its offbeat new action-RPG, Steelrising.
Steelrising, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, features a deliciously high-concept premise, unfolding in a heavily reimagined version of 18th century Paris, where players are cast as Aegis, one of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s automaton bodyguards, and charged with tracking down their maker in a bid to stop Louis XVI&#x27;s army of rogue robots.
Steelrising got its big reveal last summer, when Spiders shared a wonderfully atmospheric teaser trailer offering a glimpse of Paris&#x27; battle-ravaged streets and glorious automaton creations. And now, following a second cinematic trailer in June, the developer has provided a first look at Steelrising&#x27;s gameplay, predominantly focussing on its flashy third-person combat.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been quite some time since iconic 80s action-movie antihero RoboCop had a video game to call his own (he last appeared on PC and consoles over 18 years ago, re-emerging with a free-to-play mobile offering in 2014), but it&#x27;s been revealed everybody&#x27;s favourite cyborg security professional will be making a long-awaited gaming comeback in RoboCop: Rogue City.
RoboCop: Rogue City, which is set for release on PC and currently unannounced consoles some time in 2023, is the work of developer Teyon (the studio responsible for the critically savaged Terminator: Resistance and Rambo: The Video Game), and will feature an &quot;original story&quot; based on the events of the first three RoboCop films.
Beyond the fact that players will take on the role of  RoboCop himself - &quot;Become the iconic hero whose [sic] part man, part machine, all cop as you attempt to bring justice to the dangerous, crime-ridden streets of Old Detroit in RoboCop: Rogue City,&quot; teases publisher Nacon in its press release - specifics are currently a little scarce.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve known for a while that Kylotonn Racing is working on an all-new Test Drive Unlimited, and now we finally know where it&#x27;ll be set, with Hong Kong set to be the backdrop for the open world racer. 
The location was revealed in today&#x27;s Nacon Connect with another CGI trailer which teased some further details including a doubling down on the bling-obsessed lifestyle elements. We also got to see what the backdrop of Hong Kong will offer, from its muddy shores to its hyper-colourful streets through to its glorious hills. 
Hong Kong has been a popular destination for previous video games, of course, from Shenmue 2 to the beloved Sleeping Dogs. It follows on from Test Drive Unlimited&#x27;s Oahu setting, while its sequel headed to Ibiza (and missed out on the opportunity for a Wayne Lineker cameo - for shame).

The Witcher: Blood Origin is a new six-part series set 1,200 years before Netflix&#x27;s Henry-Cavill-starring main Witcher show and will chart the creation of the prototype Witcher, as well as the events leading to the &quot;pivotal&quot; Conjunction of the Spheres - in which a collision of different realms brought monsters into the world. 
Lauren S. Hissrich, showrunner on Netflix&#x27;s mainline Witcher series, will executive produce Blood Origin, and Declan de Barra - who penned The Witcher Season 1&#x27;s &quot;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials&quot; episode - will serve as writer and showrunner on the prequel.

In a tweet, SNK confirmed the launch platforms for the upcoming fighting game, which was recently delayed to Q1 2022 due to production issues associated with rising cases of COVID-19 in Japan.
King of Fighters 15 is due out on PC via Windows 10, Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox Series X and S. Xbox One and Nintendo Switch are not on the list.

                    <span>Surprise! Or not. Nintendo has at last unveiled its upgraded Switch model, which is due to launch on 8th October alongside Metroid Dread. It has a 7-inch OLED screen, 64GB of internal storage, a wide adjustable stand plus improved speakers.
There&#x27;s a new dock, too, with a wired LAN port.  White and neon red/blue colours will be available. Officially, it&#x27;s called the Nintendo Switch (OLED model) console. In the US it costs $350. In the UK, we&#x27;re yet to see local pricing.
We and others had expected Nintendo to push the button (flip the Switch?) and reveal its new model before E3. Nintendo really doesn&#x27;t like leaks! Anyway, on time or not, here we are:

                    <span>A vulnerability (just patched) in the random number generator used in the Kaspersky Password Manager resulted in easily guessable passwords:
The password generator included in Kaspersky Password Manager had several problems. The most critical one is that it used a PRNG not suited for cryptographic purposes. Its single source of entropy was the current time. All the passwords it created could be bruteforced in seconds. This article explains how to securely generate passwords, why Kaspersky Password Manager failed, and how to exploit this flaw. It also provides a proof of concept to test if your version is vulnerable...</span>

                    <span>RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, has announced a second paid expansion, titled Ideology, which&#x27;ll be arriving in the next few weeks alongside a substantial free content update for all players.
Following on from last year&#x27;s Royalty DLC, Ideology aims to enhance RimWorld&#x27;s celebrated core by providing the tools needed to fashion a specific belief system for your colony. &quot;You can play as tree-worshipping cannibals who carve skulls into every piece of furniture,&quot; explains developer Tynan Sylvester on Steam, &quot;or blind tunnelers who shun the light, or transhumanists obsessed with perfecting the human form using exotic technology. Or be nudists, or drug-stupor mystics, or piratical raiders, or charity-focused givers, or pain-loving animal sacrificers, or dance-party techno ravers, or rustic ranching cowboys, or many many more.&quot;
Sylvester says it&#x27;ll be possible to mix and match different core elements of a colony&#x27;s belief system in Ideology, and that customisation can be taken even further if desired, with the expansion enabling players to individually adjust preferences in the following categories: precept, ritual, special social role, venerated animal and weapon, culture and style, unique building, tattoo, clothing, background narrative, god, and, perhaps most importantly of all, beard (more on those shortly!).

                    <span>Streaming service PlayStation Now offers a huge library of games for PlayStation users giving hundreds of PS4 titles to download and play instantly. 
The biggest and arguably best game coming this month is Red Dead Redemption 2, which follows the story of outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. It is full of shootouts, heists, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with NCPs, and maintaining Arthur&#x27;s honour through the choices you choose. The action-adventure game will be available on Tuesday, 6th June.
Judgment, from the same team that created the Yakuza series, is a spin off series that follows a detective investigating a string of murders. The game will be available for three months, from 6th June until the 4th October 2021.

Last week Sony announced Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut, which is due out August on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
In doing so, Sony set the cat among the pigeons by putting a price on the various last-gen to current-gen upgrade paths.

                    <span>The next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series will not release anytime soon, according to reports. 
Grand Theft Auto 6 is still at least three or four years away, according to Battlefield insider Tom Henderson, who last week suggested GTA6 would not see a release until at least 2024 or 2025. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has now said he has heard similar.
The long wait, Henderson said, was due to a push within developer Rockstar to improve staff welfare and avoid the levels of crunch which have plagued the company over past releases. It is also, Henderson continued, because Rockstar wants to launch GTA6 at a time when the install base for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has grown considerably.

                    <span>Ubisoft has pulled Might &amp; Magic 10 - Legacy from sale following a backlash to its server shutdown.
Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for the game - leaving some unable to access significant portions of its single-player content and its DLC.
And, as Emma reported last month, despite these issues, the game and its DLC were left on sale. No more.

                    <span>A new mod for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition has fixed the series&#x27; infamous save bug involving Conrad Verner - the infamous Shepard fan who loves to bug you.
The glitch caused Mass Effect 2 to incorrectly remember how you had treated Verner in Mass Effect 1, if you were nice to him. Catching up with Verner a second time, he would always react like you had put a gun in his face to get him to desist from acting like a trained N7 recruit for his own good. 
BioWare likely left this bug unpatched in the Legendary Edition as it later retconned Verner&#x27;s glitched response in Mass Effect 3, where Verner apologises if he had misremembered Shepard&#x27;s earlier actions.

Square Enix&#x27;s long-running MMO hit 47,542 concurrent players on Steam over the weekend, according to official stats provided by Valve&#x27;s platform.
That beats the game&#x27;s previous record of 41,200, set in June 2019 just ahead of the Shadowbringers expansion.

The image shows a group of stylish caped figures, who fans will recognise as the Antivan Crows (their sigil in the bottom right confirms this).
Antivan Crows have briefly popped up in the series before (Zevran was a Crow recruit way back in Dragon Age 1), as well as its spin-off comics and novels.

                    <span>Titanfall fans have hacked Apex Legends in an effort to flag the attention of developer Respawn.
Log into Apex Legends on PC right now and instead of the usual playlists, you&#x27;ll get the URL &quot;savetitanfall.com&quot; with the subheader, &quot;[Titanfall 1] is being attacked so is Apex&quot;.
Players are also getting an &quot;important message&quot; at the end of each match that requests players &quot;visit and report savetitanfall.com&quot;, a website that&#x27;s been online since at least March 2021. Affected players are seemingly unable to access other game modes, essentially blocking them from playing at all.

                    <span>Sharkmob has updated the system requirements for its upcoming vampire-themed battle royale, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt.
Confirmation comes following a closed alpha beta test for the free-to-play game which ended earlier today.
While previously it was recommended players used a GTX 970 or RX 590, now Sharkmob suggests players use either a GTX 1070, RX 5600 XT or better for graphics,  and a SSD is &quot;strongly recommended&quot; even in the minimum spec. You&#x27;ll need around 20GB of storage, too.

While not formally revealed by the developer, the information has seemingly been leaked by a trademark filing with Justia Trademarks. The new logo - which looks in keeping with past ones from the anthology - was filed on 1st July, 2021.
As described by the trademark organisation itself, The mark consists of the word &quot;THE on top of the words DARK PICTURES, stacked on top of the words THE DEVIL IN ME&quot;.

                    <span>Dead By Daylight has hit a new record of over 100,000 concurrent players on PC during its fifth anniversary celebrations.
The new record - which coincided with a 40 per cent off Steam sale and the recent release of a bunch of Resident Evil-themed goodies, including new skins and a new killer - saw 105,093 players jump on Steam at the same time, according to SteamDB.
The milestone also comes at the same time the asymmetric horror game, developed by Behaviour Interactive, is running an time-limited event from now until 15th July, during which there&#x27;s a load of new content up for grabs, including anniversary crowns, community challenges, and enough Iridescent Shards for all players to purchase an &quot;entire original character&quot; of their choice.

                    <span>A sealed, rare variant of Nintendo&#x27;s 1987 classic The Legend of Zelda is currently for sale via auction. At the time of writing, with five days left to go on the auction, the lot has a current bid of $110,000 (£72,300).
This lot, called a &quot;NES R&quot; variant, is particularly significant because this version was &quot;only produced for a few months in late 1987&quot;. Rev-A replaced it in early 1988.
The only version considered more valuable than this one is a &quot;NES TM&quot;, and there&#x27;s reportedly only one sealed copy in existence &quot;and there is no telling whether or not that copy will ever come to market&quot;. Therefore, this cartridge is likely &quot;the earliest sealed copy one could realistically hope to obtain&quot; and sits at a grading - or wata rating - of 9.

                    <span>Nightdive Studios has published seven minutes of gameplay of its System Shock remake.
The System Shock video, below, includes plenty of skulking about in the Research level of Citadel Station.
I think it looks pretty impressive - the visuals are appropriately atmospheric, with plenty of sparky visual effects. There&#x27;s a sense of foreboding, which System Shock should have. We see enemies who lurch towards the player once they&#x27;re disturbed. The video ends with a quite terrifying fight against a large robot who takes an age to go down.

                    <span>Guild Wars 2 developer ArenaNet has issued an update on the studio and its long-running MMO.
The headline announcement is the End of Dragons expansion has been delayed from late 2021 to early 2022. In a post on the Guild Wars 2 website, ArenaNet director John Taylor explained the delay:
&quot;As expansion development has progressed and the real-world challenges of the past year and a half have changed the way we live and work, it&#x27;s become clear that we need a little more time to deliver our creative vision for Cantha. As a result, we&#x27;re delaying the release of Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons from late 2021 to early 2022.

                    <span>A Guilty Gear Strive patch stealth removed reference to Uyghur, Tibet and Taiwan in a China-related lore entry.
The change was highlighted on the ResetEra forum on 21st June after it bubbled up on Strive&#x27;s Steam forum following a patch issued on 18th June that brought Strive up to v1.03.
Neither Guilty Gear Strive publisher Bandai Namco or developer Arc System Works have commented, despite repeated requests from Eurogamer after the change emerged.

In a statement published to Twitter, Faze said it had &quot;removed&quot; Frazier Kay from its clan, and suspended Jarvis Khattri, Nikan Nadim and Teeqo until further notice.
These influencers, each with millions of YouTube subscribers and social media followers, were heavily criticised for promoting a cryptocurrency token called Save the Kids whose value plummeted soon after it launched.

                    <span>Dark Alliance got its first big update today - and its patch notes are frustratingly vague.
The Dungeons &amp; Dragons action role-playing game launched on 22nd June and was met with a mixed reception, so there are a lot of eyeballs on this first patch to see if it remedies some of the game&#x27;s more immediate issues.
Unfortunately, developer Tuque Games&#x27; patch notes for Dark Alliance v1.16 are so vague, players are struggling to work out what the update actually does.

                    <span>Mortal Kombat 11 DLC has come to an end, NetherRealm has confirmed.
The studio will now focus on its next project, it said in a tweet.
The confirmation comes as no surprise to Mortal Kombat fans - the fighting game last saw new DLC characters in November last year, when Kombat Pack 2 added John Rambo, Mileena and Rain to the fighting game.

                    <span>Doom Eternal will no longer receive its previously announced PvP-focussed Invasions mode, with id Software having made the decision to pivot development toward a new single-player horde mode instead, due to coronavirus-related development challenges.
Invasions Mode, announced back at QuakeCon 2018, was intended to deliver a vaguely Dark-Souls-esque multiplayer spin on Doom Eternal&#x27;s single-player campaign, enabling other humans to manifest as demons throughout the story and do battle with the host player for some added challenge.
Well over 12 months after Doom Eternal&#x27;s March 2020 launch, however, Invasions Mode is still yet to materialise, leaving fans to ponder its fate. And now, in a newly released statement, id Software executive producer Marty Stratton has provided an answer, confirming Invasions Mode is officially dead due to the impact &quot;the unforeseen consequences of the pandemic and remote working&quot; have had on development.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, the second game in Capcom&#x27;s RPG spin-off series, comes to Switch and PC next Friday, 9th July, and, much like its mainline sibling, will enjoy a healthy dose of post-launch support. And now, with its arrival in sight, Capcom has shared a roadmap outlining those post-release content plans.
One week after Monster Hunter Stories 2&#x27;s launch, Capcom will deploy its first (and previously detailed) post-launch update, introducing introducing Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s dog-like Palamute companion as a rideable Monstie.
That&#x27;ll be followed by a second update on 5th August introducing Hellblade Glavenus and Boltreaver Astalos as new Monsties, alongside a new co-op quest - featuring the gilded Elder Dragon Kulve Taroth - that Monster Riders can tackle together. Capcom notes that while the Elder Dragon won&#x27;t be rideable, materials gained from the quest can be used to craft &quot;powerful&quot; new equipment.

                    <span>Nexus Mods has announced that mod authors will soon be unable to delete mod files from the website, a change being made ahead of the introduction of its new collections system. 
The news was announced via a blog post, where the company explained that the change was necessary for the implementation of its collections system. From now on, mod files will be archived instead of deleted, which will make them &quot;inaccessible unless directly requested eg. via the API.&quot;
&quot;It is our core belief that making modding easier is a noble goal, so more people can enjoy our joint hobby,&quot; Nexus Mods said. &quot;We are convinced that our collections system, a project we have spent almost two years and many work-hours on, is the way to achieve this goal.&quot;

Instead, expect Fi the sword spirit to pop up less often (this is very welcome), the game to bother you with item notifications less frequently (also welcome), and for game progress to be saved automatically, in addition to manual saves.

                    <span>Humble Bundle faced criticism earlier this year when it tried to remove charity sliders from its bundle pages, a decision that would have severely limited the amount players could donate to charity for their purchases. Following significant backlash, Humble Bundle decided to reverse this decision and reinstate the sliders - but it&#x27;s once again placing limits on how much can be donated to charity. 
In a blog post, Humble Bundle announced it will be rolling out a &quot;new iteration&quot; of sliders in mid-July. &quot;While splits on each bundle will vary, on average there will be a minimum amount for Humble Bundle between 15-30 percent,&quot; the post said. This means users will no longer be able to donate the entire amount to charity, although the company said there will continue to be some &quot;100 percent to charity bundles&quot;. 
The company explained that the &quot;PC storefront landscape has changed significantly&quot; since the bundles began in 2010, and it had to &quot;continue to evolve with it to stay on mission.

                    <span>The Witcher: Monster Slayer, CD Projekt&#x27;s attempt at a Pokémon Go-style free-to-play mobile AR game, will launch for iOS and Android on 21st July.
Monster Slayer is set long before the main Witcher games, meaning you need to step up and take on the fantasy world&#x27;s many beasties yourself. 
CD Projekt first announced Monster Slayer in August last year, and said that its mobile studio Spokko was on development duties. It promised &quot;rich, story-driven quests&quot; and first-person monster battles impacted by your local time of day and weather. So, rain.

Venturebeat - which first reported on potential plans for a deal between the two back in April - say discussions have now progressed to the stage that a letter of intent has been signed while legal teams hash out the finer details. 
This leaves development work to continue (and Xbox boss Phil Spencer to continue displaying a Kojima Productions figurine on his shelf) in the meantime.

                    <span>Star Wars: The Old Republic has been around for some time now - nearly 10 years, in fact - and to mark the occasion the game is getting another expansion. 
The new expansion, titled Legacy of the Sith, was announced in a livestream last night. It&#x27;s due to add a mixture of additional story content, player rewards and new gameplay features.  
&quot;The war between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire spreads to new worlds,&quot; the announcement post explains. &quot;Dangerous fringe groups rise in the dark corners of the galaxy ​and Darth Malgus pursues an unknown plan...

                    <span>Digital PSP games will continue to be sold via the PlayStation 3 and Vita even after today&#x27;s PSP store shutdown.
PlayStation confirmed the situation in an update to its support page for discontinued apps and services this week, first noticed by ResetEra, and then confirmed by Kotaku.
So, while the PSP will still lose its purchasing functionality as planned, PSP games will still be available to play - a key concern among fans worried over Sony&#x27;s perceived lack of care for game preservation.

                    <span>One of the many highlights of Satoru Iwata&#x27;s reign at Nintendo was his series of Iwata Asks interviews - intimate, insightful and always entertaining chats between the president and the developers that started in the Wii era and carried on until Iwata&#x27;s untimely death in 2015, they&#x27;re some of the finest pieces of games journalism online. 
After an understandable hiatus, Nintendo has introduced a new similarly-themed series simply called &#x27;Ask the Developer&#x27;, with the first installment focussing on the recently released Game Builder Garage. It&#x27;s a gentle, informative and enlightening read, even if it&#x27;s short on any major revelations (although it&#x27;s opened my eyes to the stylish lab coats all Nintendo developers seem to wear at the moment). 
The interview comes as Game Builder Garage gets a free demo on Nintendo Switch, with the first of its seven lessons now available to download from the eShop.

                    <span>Mario Kart Live Home Circuit, the curious and enjoyable AR-offshoot for Nintendo&#x27;s much-loved racing series that first released in October last year, has just got a substantial new update that introduces a whole new cup and various other elements. 
The 1.1.0 update, which went live yesterday, introduces the all-new Mario Cup, and upon its completion you&#x27;re given access to new environments and gates to use in your course creations. There&#x27;s also new kart elements, with &#x27;Super Yoshi&#x27; and &#x27;Yoshi Horn&#x27; up for grabs. 
Mario Kart Live Home Circuit was the work of Velan Studios, who&#x27;ve gone on to find further success with this year&#x27;s Knockout City. Home Circuit wasn&#x27;t without its limitations, but it was still a fascinating and frequently charming thing.  &quot;A neatly crafted gizmo, and a fresh reminder that Nintendo remains a toymaker at heart,&quot; we wrote in our Mario Kart Live Home Circuit review.

                    <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator is gorgeous but notoriously demanding of PC hardware; however, developer Asobo says it&#x27;ll be getting a whole lot less demanding when its next Sim Update arrives alongside the game&#x27;s highly anticipated Xbox Series X/S release on 27th July.
Asobo offered a look the huge performance improvements coming to Microsoft Flight Simulator on PC during its latest developer livestream, with CEO Sebastian Wloch explaining the team has rewritten &quot;a lot of the parts of the engine...in order to get the maximum performance out of the sim&quot;, as part of its work on the upcoming console version.
To illustrate just how effective Asobo&#x27;s engine tweaks have been, Wloch demoed a before-and-after gameplay video featuring a flyover of Manhattan, captured from a PC equipped with an i7-9700K CPU and Nvidia 2060 Super graphics card - and running Flight Simulator at Ultra settings in 4K with a 40% render scale (jump to the 8-minute mark below to see the footage).

                    <span>What better way to enjoy the summer months than an escape to the countryside for some idyllic cottage living? And what better way to do it without the inconvenience of ever actually having to leave your house than with the Sim&#x27;s 4&#x27;s latest expansion?
The Sims 4: Cottage Living, which arrives on 22nd July, is the tenth full-scale Expansion Pack (and 42nd bit of paid DLC) to launch for life sim since its release in 2014, and - as its name very much implies - is all about cosy cottages and rustic charm.
Unsurprisingly, top of the list of features coming in Cottage Living is the ability to settle down in a charmingly rustic new abode. Here, players can befriend the likes of wild rabbits, foxes, and birds, while also raising their own animals - including llamas, chickens, and cows for wool, eggs, and milk respectively - in order to start their journey to self-sufficiency.

                    <span>Having spent some time percolating in the rumour pool (and occasionally leaking onto various ratings boards around the world), developer Sucker Punch&#x27;s &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; of its acclaimed open-world stealth-action game Ghost of Tsushima is now official, and coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 20th August.
Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut, as the new edition is formally known, features all the content from the original release, alongside a new chapter in protagonist Jin&#x27;s story, which will see him travel to Tsushima&#x27;s neighbouring island of Iki.
&quot;In this new story,&quot; Sucker Punch explains on the PlayStation Blog, &quot;Jin travels to the island to investigate rumours of a Mongol presence. But soon, he finds himself caught up in events with deeply personal stakes that will force him to relive some traumatic moments from his past.&quot;

                    <span>It&#x27;s no secret that Team Fortress 2 has a bit of a bot problem, but the game also has a community that really enjoys mid-match shenanigans - and the two combined today in one of the funniest posts about TF2 bots I&#x27;ve seen so far. 
Reddit user 2Noel posted footage of an Attack/Defend match in which Blu team was pitted against a bunch of bots - normally not great news for those wanting to keep their heads on their shoulders. Yet the team decided to try a different tactic to just charging into battle, instead choosing to conga their way out of spawn and onto the control points. And surprisingly, it worked. Stay tuned for the satisfying bot slaughter at the end of the match:  
The question you&#x27;re probably asking right now is: why didn&#x27;t the bots shoot the Blu team members? The answer, it seems, is that the bots are programmed to avoid shooting players who are using taunts and emotes. If you look closely at the video, you&#x27;ll notice that players not engaged in the conga line (such as poor old atomdotdat) are instantly sniped by the bots, while the dancers remain unharmed.

                    <span>Norse god and Disney+ star Loki is now available in Fortnite, resplendent in his original Avengers movie outfit. Sign up to the game&#x27;s £10 Fortnite Crew subscription in June and you&#x27;ll get Loki for yourself, horns and all. 
But it is those horns which are causing a problem for some fans, who have said the mischievous god&#x27;s headpiece simply blocks too much of their view.
I&#x27;ve played a few games now as Loki and haven&#x27;t seen as much of an issue as the images being shared on reddit, such as the one below. I think this is probably angled to make the problem look as bad as possible, although yes, Loki&#x27;s enormous helmet is certainly quite distracting.

                    <span>Good news for anyone particularly attached to their Valheim buildings, as developer Iron Gate has tweaked the AI to make monsters slightly less keen on smashing up structures. 
Iron Gate recently made a change to enemy AI that made monsters much more aggressive towards buildings, and players started to complain the monsters had become a bit too rowdy. Enemies were seen running past players to destroy their buildings instead, while some monsters became so confused about what they should be attacking that they essentially froze in place. I checked the patch out for myself and discovered local greydwarfs had stripped our village walls of decorations, while a run-in with a troll ended in disaster when it became a bit too interested in my friend&#x27;s treehouse:
In any case, it seems Iron Gate noticed the AI change was causing a fair bit of chaos, and the AI has been tweaked once again to solve the problems.

The Netherlands-based Nixxes has a track record of working on the PC and console versions of multiplatform projects, and in recent years has worked with Square Enix on Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and the Tomb Raider franchise. 
PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst announced the acquisition this afternoon, just two days after the confirmation that Sony had also snapped up Returnal studio Housemarque. Exactly how much Nixxes cost is being kept confidential.

                    <span>Last week we heard that several fan-made GoldenEye levels in Far Cry 5 had been pulled by Ubisoft following a copyright claim, but it seems the author has now reuploaded the levels under a new name - which will hopefully be enough to ensure the levels stay up in future. 
After confirming the levels had been pulled, creator Krollywood said a few days ago he intended to &quot;change some details like names and re-upload them as soon as possible,&quot; and it seems that&#x27;s now happened. Krollywood confirmed in a Reddit comment that the levels have been reuploaded to Far Cry 5&#x27;s arcade mode under the name &quot;Golden Cry&quot;. To find them on PS4 you&#x27;ll need to search for the creator name &quot;Perfect-Dark1982&quot;, and on PC the creator name is &quot;Graslu00&quot;.
Krollywood spent two and a half years recreating the 18 GoldenEye 007 levels in Far Cry 5&#x27;s level editor, and you can hear a little about how he did it in the video below:

                    <span>Pokémon Go has today added a new twist to its in-game Special Research questlines: the ability for storylines to branch out and end in different ways. 
The feature will be used in Pokémon Go&#x27;s upcoming Go Fest 2021 event later in July, which is this year themed around music, to offer a choice of Pikachu costumes and build a pop or rock band comprised of different creatures. 
Today, however, the feature is being rolled out via Pokémon Go&#x27;s delightfully bizarre Bidoof celebration, which has flooded the game with the meme-heavy beaver over the past week.

                    <span>As with many online games, Apex Legends unfortunately has its fair share of cheaters, and developer Respawn is in something of a continuous battle to prevent them from misbehaving. In recent months players have reported increased DDoS attacks on Ranked games, with Respawn pledging to take &quot;huge steps&quot; to fix the problem. And we now have another update on what the studio is doing to combat cheaters, with Respawn hiring more people and developing new tools to keep them at bay. 
As explained on Twitter, Respawn said it&#x27;s hiring &quot;more people to focus on manual bans&quot;, and is also investigating new ways to catch and remove cheaters from games - presumably through automated tools. Respawn also specifically addressed the DDoS problem, saying it was &quot;developing more tools to automatically detect and stop DDoS attacks&quot;. 
&quot;Playing against cheaters sucks,&quot; said Respawn&#x27;s Twitter account. &quot;We&#x27;ll keep you updated as we ship the above changes and pursue new ones.&quot;

                    <span>A Plague Tale: Innocence will launch for PlayStation 5 next month via PlayStation Plus. 
Asobo&#x27;s brilliant stealth horror game follows the story of two children on the run in medieval France, while creepy supernatural rat shenanigans ensue. 
This new version of the game, available for PS5 via Plus on 6th July, adds 4K visuals, 60FPS and faster loading. (It will also release for Xbox Series X as a free update on that date, as well as a new cloud-based version for Nintendo Switch).

                    <span>As ransomware becomes more common, I’m seeing more discussions about the ethics of paying the ransom. Here’s one more contribution to that issue: a research paper that the insurance industry is hurting more than it’s helping.
However, the most pressing challenge currently facing the industry is ransomware. Although it is a societal problem, cyber insurers have received considerable criticism for facilitating ransom payments to cybercriminals. These add fuel to the fire by incentivising cybercriminals’ engagement in ransomware operations and enabling existing operators to invest in and expand their capabilities. Growing losses from ransomware attacks have also emphasised that the current reality is not sustainable for insurers either...</span>

                    <span>PUBG&#x27;s much-teased Taego map has finally arrived on PC test servers, bringing with it some new features including self-revives and a special &quot;second chance&quot; mechanic. Well... new to PUBG, at least. 
The freshly-released patch notes explain that Taego is an 8x8 map set in 1980s South Korea, with landscapes &quot;ranging from wide-open reed fields to the close quarters of Hosan Prison&quot;. It&#x27;s also got some wildlife, with flocks of birds that react to player movement and gunfire, so take your binoculars with you - those birds might just help you track down another squad. If you stream yourself doing that, you&#x27;re a twitcher in two senses of the word. 
The map also has a new feature called Comeback BR, which gives players who die before the first Blue Zone the ability to get themselves back into the game. All you have to do is stay alive in a separate &quot;Comeback Arena&quot; for a certain amount of time. It sounds pretty similar to Call of Duty: Warzone&#x27;s Gulag, except it&#x27;s more like another mini battle royale rather than a one-on-one battle to the death. Players who survive are reintroduced to the main game in phase three of the match, complete with all their items and gear.

                    <span>Silent Hill publisher Konami has confirmed a partnership with Bloober Team, developer of horror games such as The Medium and Blair Witch.
The agreement allows Bloober to &quot;produce games from existing and new IPs&quot; which Konami owns - including, of course, the missing-in-action Silent Hill.
No further detail on the project was announced today, other than some vague promises of &quot;high quality content&quot; and the exchanging of game-making &quot;knowhow&quot;.

                    <span>Remember those Call of Duty: Modern Warfare maps that were surprise-added (and then removed) earlier this year? Well, they&#x27;re back once again, and hopefully they&#x27;re going to stick around a bit longer this time. 
The returning multiplayer maps are Al-Raab Airbase (6v6) and Drainage (Gunfight), with the former being reintroduced as a 24/7 playlist, and the latter now available in the Gunfight and Gunfight - Snipers Only playlists. 
The maps were originally added to the game in an update back in March, a move that surprised players given Activision was expected to have switched focus to supporting Black Ops Cold War and Warzone. Al-Raab Airbase and Drainage were briefly available to play in private matches, but in April Activision removed the two maps, later explaining they needed more time in the oven. Anyway, they have now returned, and should help mix things up for those still playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare multiplayer.

&quot;The [new Starfield] technology, Creation Engine 2, is sort of built for both,&quot; Howard told The Telegraph. &quot;It&#x27;s like a new tech base. The vast majority of our development development work is on Starfield right now but everybody works on everything so the projects kind of intertwine.&quot;

All purchases made in the game&#x27;s PC open beta will be refunded. Planned full launches for PlayStation, Steam and Xbox have been scrapped. 
Magic: Legends was first announced in January 2020, as the next project from Neverwinter and Star Trek Online developer Cryptic. It promised an action role-playing take on the Magic universe, more commonly seen in the ubiquitous card game.

                    <span>Control developer Remedy Entertainment has announced plans for two new titles in the series. 
The first will be a multiplayer spin-off, currently titled Project Condor. The next will be &quot;a bigger-budget Control game&quot; which sounds further off. 
Concept art for Condor shows a team of four players with a bagged-up enemy at their feet. Control franchise director Mikael Kasurinen said in a blog post that the image &quot;tells pretty well what Condor is about&quot;.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve ever felt bad about keeping all your old files in a mess, here&#x27;s something to make you feel better, as a much sought-after early version of Minecraft has finally been found - thanks to one player who made backups of her old laptop. Oh, and I guess this also means that tweeting everything is useful after all. 
As spotted by Kotaku, Twitter user @lunasorcery explained in a thread that she&#x27;d helped a group of Minecraft historians find a long-lost early version of the game. Build Alpha 1.1.1 was apparently a &quot;long-running meme&quot; and &quot;holy grail&quot; for Minecraft archivist group Omniarchive, as the historians had never been able to track the elusive build down. It was an exceedingly rare version of the game that was released on 18th September 2010, and was only available for three hours and 25 minutes due to a bug that would turn the player&#x27;s screen grey. 
Luckily, someone spotted a 2010 tweet by Luna in which she discussed the Minecraft update, and messaged her to ask if she had a copy of the build. She initially ignored the message, thinking there was &quot;no chance in hell&quot; that she would still have a copy, but last Friday another person contacted her about the tweet - and this prompted her to take a closer look.

                    <span>Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut is an unannounced new game spotted on a rating board website.
The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has a listing (thanks, ResetEra) for Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut, with Sony Interactive Entertainment mentioned as publisher, and PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 listed as platforms.
We don&#x27;t yet know what this Director&#x27;s Cut entails, but Sucker Punch&#x27;s adventure is reportedly set for a standalone expansion / DLC called Ghost of Ikishima. Perhaps that&#x27;s included.

Bugs and vulnerabilities can lead to inaccurate evidence, but the proprietary nature of software makes it hard for defendants to examine it.
The software engineers proposed a three-part test. First, the court should have access to the “Known Error Log,” which should be part of any professionally developed software project.

Given the growth and scale of the Kubernetes project, the existing reporting mechanisms were proving to be inadequate and challenging.
Kubernetes is a large open source project. With over 100000 commits just to the main k/kubernetes repository, hundreds of other code
repositories in the project, and thousands of contributors, there&#x27;s a lot going on. In fact, there are 37 contributor groups at the time of
writing. We also value all forms of contribution and not just code changes.
With that context in mind, the challenge of reporting on all this activity was a call to action for exploring better options. Therefore
inspired by the Apache Software Foundation’s open guide to PMC Reporting and the
CNCF project Annual Reporting, the Kubernetes project is proud to ann…</span>

                    <span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will see its final DLC character released later this year, series director Masahiro Sakurai has confirmed.
In a video showing off DLC character Kazuya Mishima, out tomorrow, 29th June, Sakurai said the final character to be released as part of Fighters Pass Vol. 2 will be Ultimate&#x27;s last.
&quot;Up until now, we&#x27;ve created all sorts of fighters and stages,&quot; Sakurai said.

                    <span>Last week, Valheim developer Iron Gate rolled out a patch that was intended to provide players with an extra level of challenge: enemies were tweaked to be more aggressive towards structures, meaning players would have to be more proactive about defending their homes. But some players feel Iron Gate went overboard with these changes, highlighting that the patch has resulted in some strange enemy behaviour - along with the wanton destruction of property. 
Over on the Valheim subreddit, players have argued that Valheim&#x27;s monsters are now too eager to attack buildings, sometimes opting to destroy structures even when standing directly next to the player. This has led to some &quot;immersion-shattering&quot; enemy behaviour, with monsters looking uncertain about who they should be attacking. Some players, meanwhile, are simply exasperated at the amount of damage now being caused in monster raids. 
&quot;Earlier today I had a troll invasion and I had three trolls attacking my base non-stop,&quot; said Reddit user Squatch11. &quot;I literally couldn&#x27;t get them to attack me. Half of my base was destroyed before I managed to kill them.&quot;

                    <span>A Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City reverse-engineering fan project is back online after Take-Two issued a takedown earlier this year.
As Eurogamer reported in February, the GTA 3 and Vice City reverse-engineering fan projects known as re3 and reVC were hit by a DMCA filed by Rockstar parent company Take-Two that claimed copyright infringement.
The fan-created source code for both games was made available on GitHub, offering a raft of eye-catching improvements over the original games officially available to play today on PC. (For more, check out our feature on how re3 came to be.)

That&#x27;s according to franchise producer Masaru Oyamada, who was speaking during the Mana series&#x27; 30th anniversary live stream, below (thanks, Gematsu):
&quot;We wanted to announce it by running a cool trailer, but we&#x27;re only at the start of the 30th anniversary,&quot; Oyamada said.

                    <span>River, the real-life dog who inspired Dogmeat from Fallout 4, has passed away.
Joel Burgess, studio director at Capybara Games and former developer on Fallout 3, 4 and 76 at Bethesda, took to Twitter to look back at her impact on Fallout 4.
Dogmeat is a recurring dog non-player character in the Fallout series who acts as a possible companion to the player. Dogmeat is one of the most popular companions in the series, and was even a part of trailers made to promote Fallout 4.

As part of its &quot;one-year anniversary celebration&quot;, the Nintendo Switch-exclusive free-to-play &quot;Ninja-Gum&quot; action game is teaming up with the anime Demon Slater: Kimetsu no Yaiba for a limited-time event running from mid-July until the end of August.
Kicking off on 19th July, the collaboration will reportedly &quot;not only feature Tanjiro and Nezuko, but other members of the Demon Slayer Corps including Zenitsu and Rengoku, and their nemesis Muzan Kibutsuji himself&quot; (thanks, Nintendo Life).

According to translation courtesy of Google Translate, Kiciński told TVN24: &quot;We have already achieved a satisfactory level in this regard [of stability]. We have also been working on the overall efficiency, which we are also quite happy about. Of course, we also removed bugs and glitches, and we will continue to do that.&quot;

The reply came from technical director, John Lafleur.

It solidifies a leak that came to light last week, when the same title similarly popped up in Australia.
This time, H2 Interactive Co. Ltd submitted the game to the panel - in Australia, it was publisher and IP holder Konami itself - which has been awarded an ages 12 and up rating (thanks, VG24/7).

                    <span>Valve&#x27;s 2007 shooter Team Fortress 2 just broke its all-time concurrent players count.
According to Steam&#x27;s official stats, the multiplayer FPS hit a peak of 151,253 concurrent players on Steam on Friday night.
The previous high was 147,360 concurrent players in December. At the time of this article&#x27;s publication, Team Fortress 2 had 141,741 concurrent players on Steam.

                    <span>Modders do incredible things with the video games we love. They build expansion-sized add-ons, issue performance fixes, and come up with the weird and wonderful to extend the life of games long since left behind by their original creators.
And then there&#x27;s this, a Greggs in Far Cry 5.
Edinburgh-based artist Mojo Swoptops recreated our nation&#x27;s sandwich shop in fine detail. It&#x27;s got a Greggs-looking counter flanked not by fridges stuffed with sparsely-filled sandwiches but shelving units packed with fruit. The Greggs sign is pretty close, though.

                    <span>Mass Effect Legendary Edition has certainly done the trick: it&#x27;s rekindled a love of BioWare&#x27;s original trilogy years after the games came out. But it&#x27;s not just Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 that are being judged once again. Fans are reappraising Mass Effect Andromeda, too.
2017&#x27;s Mass Effect Andromeda endured a torrid time upon release, with clips of dialogue scenes descending into meme status. There were other areas of the game that came under fire, including its limited character creator, bugs and animation quirks.
Beyond that, though, Andromeda&#x27;s missions, storyline and characters failed to set the world on fire. Without Commander Shepard, the Normandy and the original trilogy&#x27;s cast of much-loved characters, Andromeda set out for a new galaxy, a new premise and new party members. I think it&#x27;s fair to say it didn&#x27;t stick the landing. Some thought the game was just okay, others considered it outright awful. Either way, Andromeda flopped and BioWare soon moved on, leaving it sequel-less.

                    <span>The Halo TV show will reportedly lose its showrunner after season one is over.
Variety reports lead showrunner Steven Kane will not return, should the show get picked up for a second season. Variety suggests a second season &quot;seems likely... given the high-profile nature of the underlying IP and the high level of investment on ViacomCBS&#x27; part&quot;.
Kane has been in Budapest, where production of the Halo TV show is ongoing, for the past two years and wants to return to the states for &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

                    <span>Friday the 13th: The Game was set for an Among Us-style mode before a lawsuit blocked development.
That&#x27;s according to Wes Keltner, CEO of Gun Media and one of the developers of Friday the 13th.
In a TwitLonger post, Keltner revealed a raft of content planned for the game before development was shut down in 2018 because of a messy Hollywood battle over ownership of the franchise.

The &quot;digital convention&quot; will be streamed at 6pm UK time on 9th July, and includes &quot;deep dives&quot; into the making of the Witcher games, the live action series and anime film. The WitcherCon teaser is below:

                    <span>There was once a Mass Effect movie in the works. In 2010 EA sold off the film rights to Legendary Pictures, with then BioWare bosses Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk set to work as executive producers alongside former Mass Effect chief Casey Hudson. But it failed to materialise. Why?
In a recent interview with Business Insider, BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained what happened.
&quot;It felt like we were always fighting the IP,&quot; he said. &quot;What story are we going to tell in 90 to 120 minutes? Are we going to do it justice?&quot;

                    <span>Activision has defeated WWE wrestler Booker T in a Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 likeness lawsuit.
Booker T. Huffman claimed unlicensed use of his character &#x27;G.I. Bro&#x27; with the character &#x27;Prophet&#x27; from Treyarch&#x27;s Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in a lawsuit filed in February 2019.
The lawsuit revolved around a poster Booker T commissioned and used to promote his 2015 comic, G.I. Bro and the Dragon of Death. The comic stars a &quot;special operations hero called G.I. Bro&quot;. Prophet, from 2018&#x27;s Black Ops 4, is a &quot;cybernetically enhanced soldier&quot;. The image below compares the two characters:

                    <span>A fan has made a video imagining a battle royale with cartoon characters set in Apex Legends maps.
Redditor Elpinko made this video after first creating a test version using just Family Guy characters. &quot;I can say that I have spent the last three days perfecting and tweaking but honestly I got carried away,&quot; he said. 
The video was made by putting together different clips from the famous TV shows, using exclusively cartoon characters, to create a battle royale match. Elpinko took action scenes out of the shows and paired them against each other with Apex maps as the setting.

                    <span>Good news everyone, Konami&#x27;s working on a brand new game - other than New Football Game Online Performance Test - and this one certainly looks intriguing. It&#x27;s a &quot;mystery simulation game&quot; called Crimesight, where players must deduce &quot;not only the culprit, but the victim as well&quot;. What, were you expecting Silent Hill? 
The social deduction game is set in a futuristic version of London where crimes can be predicted using an &quot;analytical programme developed using data harvested online&quot;. This has led to reduced crime rates across the world, but the system predicts a crime that could &quot;plunge the world into chaos&quot;, prompting the system&#x27;s architects to create an AI called Sherlock to investigate and prevent this crime.
Sherlock must prevent the criminal mastermind AI (named Moriarty, of course) from committing simulated murder, while Moriarty will try to predict the perfect moment to murder an NPC avatar. The trailer explains that Crimesight allows for 2-4 person multiplayer, and that the game takes place on what looks like a virtual tabletop board.

                    <span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a next-gen exclusive game - it&#x27;s due out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and Stadia at some point in 2022 (assuming it doesn&#x27;t get delayed). But what does being next-gen exclusive actually mean?
In the video below, developer Massive Entertainment discusses how the team has improved its Snowdrop game engine - the one it used to build The Division - to make use of the more powerful hardware.
There&#x27;s a lot of talk about ray tracing and object detail, which is great. And Avatar does look like quite the tech powerhouse - a game that will actually push those next-gen consoles. But my ears were pricked by something Alice Rendell, lead narrative realisation designer, mentioned too: Massive has created a system where NPCs understand the state of the world. For example, they&#x27;re aware of the weather, player progression and time of day. That sounds pretty cool, and I&#x27;m already imagining NPCs complaining about the rain. It rains on Pandora, right?

                    <span>Microsoft unveiled Windows 11 last night, and in doing so mentioned new gaming-focused features.
Windows 11 automatically adds high dynamic range (HDR) enhancements to games built on DirectX 11 or higher that previously only used standard dynamic range (SDR). HDR allows a supported game to render a much wider range of brightness values and colours. It&#x27;s a tech already in the Xbox Series X and S. Microsoft mentioned over 1000 games will support auto HDR, including Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, Rocket League, DayZ, and even Doom 64.
Microsoft said Windows 11 will load new games faster via tech called DirectStorage. Again, this was a part of Xbox Series X and S tech. DirectStorage means games quickly load assets to the graphics card without bogging down the CPU. Microsoft  said to expect incredibly detailed game worlds rendered at &quot;lightning speeds&quot; and without long load times. &quot;DirectStorage Optimised&quot; Windows 11 PCs are configured with the hardware and drivers needed to enable this.

The video showcases GTA 5 running in 8k on an Nvidia RTX 3090. Various mods have been applied, such as QuantV, which updates the games graphics and GTA 5 Real Life Pack.

                    <span>Insomniac Games has largely focused on single-player titles over the last few years, producing big hits Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man for the PlayStation. But it seems the studio has plans to work on a multiplayer project - although exactly what this could be is anyone&#x27;s guess. 
A job advert posted by Insomniac on Twitter mentions the developer has &quot;five new job openings for a multiplayer project&quot;. Insomniac is looking for a creative director, systems designer, story lead, art director and VFX artist. 
That doesn&#x27;t give much away, but the systems designer job description does mention having a &quot;thorough understanding of melee combat systems, enemy design and boss design&quot; would be useful experience. The designer would help develop &quot;combat, navigation, progression, and economy&quot; for a multiplayer environment. Make of that what you will.

In a post on Halo Waypoint, live team design director Ryan Paradis and lead progression designer Christopher Blohm discussed 343&#x27;s seasons and battle pass philosophy.
Infinite&#x27;s seasons will each last three months, which, according to Paradis, &quot;gives players a good amount of time to experience and explore the seasonal content, without it getting tiresome and without constantly pulling the rug from under players.&quot;

                    <span>Ubisoft has pulled GoldenEye levels a fan made in Far Cry 5 after a copyright infringement complaint.
YouTuber Krollywood spent two-and-a-half years recreating Rare&#x27;s seminal N64 first-person shooter inside the level editor provided within Far Cry 5, but this week Ubisoft removed the levels from the game&#x27;s arcade mode after a copyright infringement claim reportedly issued by MGM.
All 18 GoldenEye campaign levels were remade and made available to play by anyone in Far Cry 5&#x27;s arcade mode, even with the odd additional Easter egg. You can check out the Dam remake level in the video below:

                    <span>It&#x27;s very much a case of &#x27;gotta go faster&#x27; this week on the Epic Games Store, where Sega&#x27;s masterful retro platformer reimagining Sonic Mania and the excellent old-school arcade racer Horizon Chase Turbo are both currently free.
2017&#x27;s Sonic Mania, if it somehow managed to pass you by, sees developer Christian Whitehead and team serving up a sumptuous smorgasbord of classic side-scrolling platforming, meticulously designed to evoke the breathless left-right thrills of Sonic&#x27;s 16-bit heyday. 
Brand-new stages sit alongside beloved classics taken from Sonic 1 through Sonic &amp; Knuckles - all thoroughly, expertly remixed to form playful new challenges - and the package is topped off with vibrant visuals and a flawless soundtrack, both managing to perfectly capture the spirit of Sonic&#x27;s original Mega Drive adventures.

                    <span>Following various not-so-subtle teases from the Apex Legends Twitter account, Respawn has announced that the original Kings Canyon map is returning in an upcoming Collection Event. Oh, and everyone&#x27;s favourite murder site, Skull Town, is being introduced as an Arenas map. 
The Genesis Collection Event kicks off on 29th June and lasts until 13th July, offering a bunch of new paid cosmetics (and what looks like an extremely cool Revenant scythe heirloom). As usual, you can acquire these by purchasing event packs or buying them directly with Apex Coins or Crafting Materials. You&#x27;ll need to purchase all 24 items to unlock the Revenant heirloom - paying for all of that would certainly be the death of me. 
There are some freebies, however: players will be able to earn 1600 points per day in daily challenges as part of the event&#x27;s rewards track. This includes legendary Charge Rifle and EVA-8 skins, along with a variety of charms. On top of this, there are some stretch challenges with special event badges as rewards.

                    <span>Cowering in terror used to be one of my absolute favourite strategies during my early Valheim days, but from now on it seems that will be a less viable tactic. Developer Iron Gate is introducing some enemy AI tweaks to make monsters more aggressive, which should encourage them to start barging into your base. How rude.
The latest Valheim patch notes explain that the new update will fix several AI issues, with monsters made &quot;slightly more aggressive&quot;. They will now &quot;attack your buildings etc. when they are not able to attack you&quot;, meaning you&#x27;ll probably have to be more proactive in taking out enemies before they destroy your beautiful wooden structures. &quot;It&#x27;s fun for the whole family,&quot; Iron Gate said in the patch notes. (Is it, though?)
If you&#x27;re strolling through the Black Forest, you may also want to watch your head, as the Greydwarfs have had their aim improved - meaning they now have half a chance of actually getting a shot on target. A &quot;long forgotten Blob event&quot; has also been enabled, while bosses will no longer run from you. All in all, it sounds like the world of Valheim is getting a little more dangerous.

                    <span>It&#x27;s time for the latest chapter in Valve&#x27;s ongoing battle with Team Fortress 2 bots: this week sees a new update that should, in theory, make bot behaviour slightly less annoying.
As detailed on the Team Fortress 2 updates page, TF2 was patched on Tuesday with a number of measures that should limit what bots get up to when in-game. There&#x27;s now a tool to control how many times players can change their name in a match, for instance, and for public matchmaking it seems this has been set to zero - thus preventing bots from frequently changing their names or mimicking real players. 
The update also introduces a grace period at the start of matches to prevent players immediately calling votes, which should put the brakes on bots that are trying to deliberately clog up the vote-kick system. Similarly, players joining an in-progress game will face a cooldown before they can call a vote. Kick votes will also &quot;end early and automatically pass if the vote target leaves the match during the vote&quot;.

                    <span>Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy - leaving some players unable to access significant portions of the game&#x27;s single-player content and its DLC. And despite these issues, the game and its DLC are still on sale.
The server shutdown began on 1st June, after which players began to report problems accessing DLC areas from the game&#x27;s The Falcon &amp; The Unicorn expansion. Players who owned the DLC also found they were unable to play past Act 1 of the main game with the expansion installed. Some who bought the deluxe version reported they could no longer access the special in-game items included with that version (via PC Gamer). 
Players have been creating their own workarounds for the problems, with some editing NPC dialogue to do so, but so far there hasn&#x27;t been an official fix. Ubisoft told Eurogamer it is &quot;aware and investigating the reported issues with our internal teams&quot;.

                    <span>The people behind Skywind have issued a video update for the eye-catching fan project - and it still sounds a long way away from completion.
Skywind is a non-commercial, fan-made modification for The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim that recreates The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind with the enhanced graphics and capabilities of Skyrim&#x27;s engine.
In the video, below, the Skywind team show off the work done so far, and announce a few major milestones, such as the completion of almost all the concept art.

                    <span>Konami has quietly launched a demo for PES 2022.
The brilliantly-named &#x27;New Football Game Online Performance Test&#x27; is available to download now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S. You don&#x27;t need PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold.
The demo kicked off at midnight just gone, and runs until midnight on 8th July. The video below includes gameplay of a full online match I played this morning between Manchester United and Bayern Munich. Spoilers: there are a few goals!

                    <span>The Norwegian Consumer Council just published a fantastic new report: “Time to Ban Surveillance-Based Advertising.” From the Introduction:
The challenges caused and entrenched by surveillance-based advertising include, but are not limited to:
privacy and data protection infringements
opaque business models
manipulation and discrimination at scale
fraud and other criminal activity
serious security risks
In the following chapters, we describe various aspects of these challenges and point out how today’s dominant model of online advertising is a threat to consumers, democratic societies, the media, and even to advertisers themselves. These issues are significant and serious enough that we believe that it is time to ban these detrimental practices...</span>

                    <span>Space Jam - the cult Looney-Tunes-meets-live-action basketball movie from the 90s - is getting the retro-style video game beat-&#x27;em-up treatment for Xbox, PC, and mobile to promote upcoming movie sequel, Space Jam: A New Legacy, and it&#x27;ll be accompanied by a range of new Space-Jam-themed Xbox controllers.
According to a new post on Xbox Wire, Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game, developed by Digital Eclipse, was inspired by a number of fan-submitted idea picked as part of a competition held late last year. That ultimately led to the creation of a 90s-inspired arcade beat-&#x27;em-up in which Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, and LeBron James engage in some basketball-imbued brawling to defeat a virtual army controlled by a nefarious AI.
&quot;Fortunately,&quot; explains Microsoft, &quot;our heroes have access to a variety of moves, including a special basketball, and some rather unique Space Jam cards, to help them out.&quot;

                    <span>The original Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive first launched in Japan on 23rd June 1991 - 30 years ago today.
Sonic himself is actually a couple of years older. Like the Nintendo mascot he was engineered to replicate, Sonic first popped up elsewhere - in 1991 Sega arcade racer Rad Mobile - before getting his own game.
But it&#x27;s that 1991 side-scrolling classic which defined Sonic&#x27;s appeal, as well as the series&#x27; gameplay, design and villain Doctor &quot;Eggman&quot; Robotnik.

Iron Harvest and Prodeus (the latter via its early access Game Preview) also arrive on the same date.

                    <span>Youtuber Harrison Kinsley has used an AI tool named GameGAN to recreate a highway stretch from GTA 5. A video showing off the results - named GTA5: GAN Theft Auto - is worth a watch.
Using GameGAN, Kinsley collaborated with developer Daniel Kukieła on this two-month project, which followed a similar idea last year that recreated Pac-Man by watching another AI play through the game.
Neither of the two collaborators came in with much knowledge of GANs, Kinsley told Eurogamer. &quot;It was a lot of trial and error and just small tweaks and seeing if and how they improved. We didn&#x27;t have much knowledge, so we had a lot of learning to do, and still do.&quot;

Now, an update on the game&#x27;s official Twitter account has stated that Blaston &quot;isn&#x27;t the best fit for this type of advertising test&quot;. The trial has now been cancelled.

                    <span>Two fans who leaked details of Pokémon Sword and Shield back in 2019 will be forced to pay $150k - each.
Newly-filed court documents show The Pokémon Company has now reached a $300k settlement with the pair, who are described as having stolen &quot;trade secrets&quot; by snapping &quot;illicit pictures from an unreleased strategy guide&quot; (thanks, Polygon). 
One of the defendants was discovered to have been employed at LSC Communications, the company which had printed the Pokémon Sword and Shield strategy guide. The other defendant was identified as the individual who had then received photos of the guide via a group chat and posted them onto Discord, making them public.

In a regulatory filing ahead of a say-on-pay vote set for August, EA said it had &quot;considered stockholder feedback&quot; and made &quot;substantial changes&quot; to executive pay for the 2022 financial year.
Last year&#x27;s say-on-pay vote saw 170.89m votes against the company&#x27;s plan versus just 59.6m votes for.

How long will the pre-show be? When will the actual show start? EA has not provided either of these details, presumably in a bid to hook you in earlier and have you watching the whole thing.

In a note on the Microsoft Store, Microsoft said updates to the game had caused the change.

The popular field upgrade does exactly what it says on the tin: it temporarily makes your footsteps silent. But there&#x27;s more: it also makes your movement slightly faster.
It&#x27;s extremely powerful in Warzone. Getting the jump on an opponent is often the name of the game, and if they can&#x27;t hear your footsteps, you&#x27;re at a distinct advantage.

                    <span>A new Grand Theft Auto 5 mod lets players transform into Godzilla and rampage across San Andreas.
Eight years on from its release the action-adventure game developed by Rockstar Games is still extremely popular, especially because of the constant remastering of GTA 5.
JulioNIB, a notorious modder who has created many popular mods in the past is in the process of making the Ultimate Godzilla mod.

The star of this wave, the Luigi Starter Course, had been officially announced already (after its creepy tease which cause Mario Starter Course figurines to begin crying out).
We&#x27;ve also had a look at the hulking Bowser&#x27;s Airship expansion already - that leaked last week - and the next wave of 10 blind bag figurines available in the Series 3 Character Packs.

                    <span>Chinese conglomerate Tencent now holds a majority stake in Yager, the Berlin-based developer behind cult favourite 2012 shooter Spec Ops: The Line.
Tencent first acquired a small stake in the company back in February 2020. At the time, Yager said it would put the funds towards its free-to-play multiplayer game The Cycle, and then unnamed future projects.
Today&#x27;s news was revealed in an interview with Yager boss Timo Ullmann by German site gameswirtschaft.de, and picked up by Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad. In it, Ullmann says the move comes ahead of a relaunch for The Cycle based on early access feedback.

If this sounds familiar, that&#x27;s because Blue Box said as much back in April. And again last week on Twitter. And now again today.

                    <span>It looks like Call of Duty: Warzone&#x27;s controversial Roze skin is finally, properly nerfed.
Developer Raven made a change to the skin for the start of Season 4, and it has brightened up what was a very dark outfit for operator Roze.
Activision&#x27;s battle royale has for months come under fire for a particular skin for Roze, which many considered &quot;pay-to-win&quot;.

                    <span>Since the start of its new season, Fortnite&#x27;s island has lain in the shadow of a giant UFO mothership. Today, you can beam aboard and explore.
Get beamed up and you&#x27;ll find yourself in a mini dungeon filled with locations from the past to hop around in low-gravity. (I am delighted to see the return of the much-missed Butter Barn, home of Fortnite&#x27;s brilliant pancake song.)
With 90 seconds on the clock, the aim of the game is to collect alien orbs which boost the amount of loot you&#x27;ll get upon leaving. You can also extend your time in the mothership by picking up timer orbs.

Kidscreen reports Paris-based Cyber Group Studios has done a deal with Square Enix to adapt the 21-year-old role-playing game into an animated series aimed at eight to 13-year-olds.
It&#x27;s early days, though. Cyber Group Studios plans to pitch the project to broadcasters in the coming months, with production set to begin by the end of 2021 or beginning of 2022. Episode count and length have yet to be decided.

                    <span>After more than a year of gameplay bonuses designed to make Pokémon Go easier to play during the pandemic, developer Niantic has laid out a detailed roadmap for how it will remove, replace and adopt these changes in the future.
Some changes will be made permanent, though others - most notably the ability to interact with PokéStops and gyms at an increased distance - will be removed. 
But changes will be made on a country-by-country basis, Niantic has said, and in the short term there will be new temporary &quot;exploration bonuses&quot; for countries which lose the pandemic changes soon.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve boss Bobby Kotick&#x27;s $155m pay packet after a controversial delay.
GamesIndustry.biz reports the say-on-pay vote, which had been delayed to this week in what was seen by some as an effort by Activision Blizzard to avoid an embarrassing slapdown, won approval from 54 percent of shareholders - down from the 56.8 percent approval seen last year, which itself was down from the 58 percent approval of 2019.
The decision comes following significant pressure from CtW, an investment company that &quot;holds directors accountable for irresponsible and unethical corporate behaviour and excessive executive pay&quot;.

                    <span>At this year’s Apple Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple announced something called “iCloud Private Relay.” That’s basically its private version of onion routing, which is what Tor does.
Privacy Relay is built into both the forthcoming iOS and MacOS versions, but it will only work if you’re an iCloud Plus subscriber and you have it enabled from within your iCloud settings.
Once it’s enabled and you open Safari to browse, Private Relay splits up two pieces of information that — when delivered to websites together as normal — could quickly identify you. Those are your IP address (who and exactly where you are) and your DNS request (the address of the website you want, in numeric form)...</span>

Operators are proving to be an excellent solution to
running stateful distributed applications in Kubernetes. Open source tools like
the Operator SDK provide ways to build reliable and maintainable
operators, making it easier to extend Kubernetes and implement custom
scheduling.
Kubernetes operators run complex software inside your cluster. The open source
community has already built many operators for distributed
applications like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, or Argo CD. Even outside of

Speaking on his YouTube series Harada&#x27;s Bar, Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada discussed the ill-fated project, which was announced 11 years ago in July 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

                    <span>After being interrupted during mining in the Black Forest for the thousandth time, you could be forgiven for wanting to beat up a Greydwarf with your bare hands - and thanks to the work of Valheim&#x27;s modding community, you now can. Well, while holding VR controllers, I guess. 
VHVR is a community-made VR mod for Valheim that was first released back in April, and did a pretty good job of translating Valehim&#x27;s Viking world into VR (even if players could only move using a standard gamepad or mouse and keyboard). Here&#x27;s our own Ian Higton trying it out at the time:
Work on the mod continued post-launch, and now VHVR has been given a game-changing update that adds motion control support. Thanks to the work of modder Maddy25 (who apparently almost single-handedly implemented many of the motion control systems), you can now interact with items in Valheim more directly. There&#x27;s upper-body and finger tracking using VRIK, melee combat, bow and arrow controls, fishing, point and click building, and you can use your hands to interact with the environment. There are also custom VR controls for interacting with menus, along with switching and equipping items.

                    <span>Pokémon Go will introduce a new costumed Pikachu variant only available in the Okinawa islands of Japan.
It&#x27;s the first time the game has reserved a costumed Pokémon specifically for a certain region - and a small one, at that. 
Immediately, the announcement raised eyebrows among fans wanting to catch &#x27;em all - but unable to do so due to ongoing international travel restrictions.

                    <span>Star Wars Squadrons developer EA Motive is working on the revival of an established, fan-favourite IP.
That&#x27;s according to a comment made by GamesBeat&#x27;s ever-chatty Jeff Grubb, which was picked up by VGC, and which tallies with information we&#x27;ve also heard.
According to Grubb, EA plans to announce the project at its upcoming EA Play event in just a few weeks&#x27; time. So, act surprised.

                    <span>The Center for Security and Emerging Technology has a new report: “Machine Learning and Cybersecurity: Hype and Reality.” Here’s the bottom line:
The report offers four conclusions:
Machine learning can help defenders more accurately detect and triage potential attacks. However, in many cases these technologies are elaborations on long-standing methods — not fundamentally new approaches — that bring new attack surfaces of their own.
A wide range of specific tasks could be fully or partially automated with the use of machine learning, including some forms of vulnerability discovery, deception, and attack disruption. But many of the most transformative of these possibilities still require significant machine learning breakthroughs.

                    <span>Square Enix says it is &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; by the success of its new IP, Outriders, stating &quot;the digital sales ratio for the title have been very high&quot; and insisting that its &quot;decision to make Outriders available with Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass as soon as the title launched also worked in [its] favour&quot;.
Xbox teased the shooter was coming to Xbox Game Pass just a couple of weeks before release, and swiftly became one of the service&#x27;s most high-profile Game Pass offerings. Now, a few months on, Square Enix says that despite the &quot;slight issues&quot; with bugs and server instability, it has &quot;gotten off to a good start as a new IP&quot;.
&quot;In regards to the response to Outriders, while there were slight issues with bugs and the like on launch, we believe it has gotten off to a good start as a new IP,&quot; Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda told investors at a financial briefing back in May, the English translation of which was published today (thanks, VGC).

According to an analysis by dataminer PlayerIGN (thanks, PCGN), as well as self-pickup, TAEGO&#x27;s new 8x8 map will also feature a new Pony Coupe vehicle, 5.56 K2 Assault Rifle, 5.56 K12 DMR, a &quot;new airdrop type&quot;, a possible new Zone feature, and the return of Paramo&#x27;s Chinook helicopter.
A second teaser and screenshots released in Korea also suggest we&#x27;ll see a palace and a school on the new map, with rumours the new content will be available to play on the PC Test Server from 30th June.

                    <span>The team behind Among Us, Innersloth, has opened up about feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; and &quot;burnt out&quot; after the success of their cult classic multiplayer detective game during lockdown.
&quot;Among Us going viral, it was just like, &#x27;OK, this is my life,&#x27;&quot; said artist Amy Liu. &quot;The pressure to get things done quickly was really high. September to December, we&#x27;re talking to Xbox, PlayStation. They were gonna try to get Among Us on these platforms, which usually takes many months - like, half a year to a year. We were like, &#x27;Three months! We&#x27;re gonna try that.&#x27;&quot;
&quot;I definitely burnt out,&quot; Liu told Anthony Padilla (thanks, Kotaku). &quot;It was tough because during all of this, we weren&#x27;t able to see friends and family. Being so tired from working, I couldn&#x27;t even go visit my family during covid and had to spend holidays alone... that was definitely the hardest time.&quot;

The role-playing game based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons tabletop launched in early access form in October 2020, and last saw an update in February.

It means the upcoming Left 4 Dead spiritual successor cannot be played offline, even solo with AI teammates.
&quot;We&#x27;re looking into ways we could support offline for the future but you will need an internet connection to play at launch,&quot; Turtle Rock tweeted in response to a question on the subject.

Modder FGCdraft created a Potato Low Spec mod for Arc System Works&#x27; wonderful anime fighting game to help people get it running on underpowered hardware, and in the process created a pixel art aesthetic I&#x27;m very much on board with.
FGCdraft&#x27;s video, below, shows off the potato mod in all its glory. The download instructions are in the video description.

                    <span>Biomutant has a new patch that makes significant improvements to the game.
Developer Experiment 101 released the patch yesterday to the PC and PlayStation versions of the game. It&#x27;s due out on Origin and Xbox soon.
The headline additions are an increased level cap from 50 to 100 and the much-requested scrap action to the loot screen, which should reduce time spent cleaning up the inventory.

The co-op ghost-hunting game is created by 25-year-old UK indie developer &#x27;Dknighter&#x27;, who took to Phasmophobia&#x27;s Steam page to announce the expansion of studio Kinetic Games.
&quot;Over the past few years I have been developing Phasmophobia on my own however due to how much it has grown in both popularity and its future content plans it is now time to expand the team,&quot; Dknighter said.

                    <span>EA has increased the Battlefield 4 server capacity after a player spike following the Battlefield 2042 reveal.
In a post on EA&#x27;s website, community manager &#x27;Straatford&#x27; said the company had noticed queue times in the US West region for the 2013 DICE-developed shooter were far longer than in other regions. In response, EA increased server capacity in this region, so players should expect less waiting to get into a game.
&quot;We were absolutely blown away by your excitement and reactions to the recent Battlefield 2042 reveal,&quot; Straatford said.

                    <span>Outriders&#x27; next patch tackles one of the biggest issues with the game: the dreaded grind for legendaries.
In a post on reddit, Outriders&#x27; community manager from publisher Square Enix &#x27;thearcan&#x27; outlined a raft of changes coming to the looter shooter in a patch set for early next week.
Chief among them is a significant change to legendary drops. Legendary drop rates, across the board, will increase by 100 percent with this update.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone got a new LMG this week - and already its developer has promised a nerf.
The MG 82, added to the game as a tier 15 unlock from the Season 4 battle pass on Thursday, was soon found to shred enemies extremely quickly - at a time when developer Raven wants to increase Warzone&#x27;s &#x27;time-to-kill&#x27;.
One of the other issues with the gun is it is available out in the field as ground loot. This means players have early access to an extremely strong gun, simply from looting. Sometimes you&#x27;ll pick up the MG 82 with decent attachments, too.

                    <span>Pottering around a Viking-era version of your home in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is an enormous amount of fun - as I discovered from my adventures in Gloucestershire - but could it also encourage others to visit your country? That&#x27;s what Tourism Ireland is banking on, as the organisation has teamed up with Ubisoft to use Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla in a promotional campaign. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s first expansion, Wrath of the Druids, brings Viking protagonist Eivor across the seas to embark on new adventures in Ireland. Locations such as Dublin, Benbulben, the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and the Hill of Tara are all visitable in-game, and Tourism Ireland has collaborated with Ubisoft to create a comparison video showing the game versions and their real-life counterparts: 
The campaign doesn&#x27;t end there, however, as streamers in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Scandinavia will help showcase Irish landscapes in Wrath of the Druids as part of the collaboration. This is the first time that Tourism Ireland has worked with gaming content creators.

                    <span>Under increasing pressure from governments, children&#x27;s welfare groups and gambling charities, EA has today added the ability to see what&#x27;s inside FIFA 21 loot boxes before you buy them.
These Ultimate Team Preview Packs, as EA calls them, let you see all the specific items contained within them before you make a decision on whether to buy with FUT Coins or FIFA Points.
FUT Coins is a virtual currency earned through gameplay. FIFA Points is a virtual currency bought with real-world money.

                    <span>Thanos has appeared in Fortnite before, of course, as part of a previous Avengers mode where playing as the Mad Titan made you deliberately overpowered. 
Three years on from that mode&#x27;s appearance, however, you&#x27;ll soon be able to obtain Thanos for keeps.

                    <span>Alan Wake Remastered and Final Fantasy 7 Remake were both spotted in Epic Games Store updates, suggesting a PC release is coming.
Redditor AsleepEntrepreneur73 spotted updates for both games on the EpicData website, an Epic Games Store data tracker.
It looks like both games&#x27; entry on the database is via codenames (HeronStaging for Alan Wake Remastered, and Pineapple for Final Fantasy 7 Remake), but you can see the real game names in the cloud save folder.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s big Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla update added a new mode to the game, Mastery Challenge, which offers a series of repeatable maps to stomp and stealth your way through in return for fresh rewards. 
We knew the gist of all this already - and we&#x27;ll go into more detail below - but what has come as a nice surprise is the new narrative this mode folds into the game, including a tease for something else being added to Valhalla down the line. 
The Mastery Challenge questline begins with a bang, as a meteor hits Eivor&#x27;s Ravensthorpe. The impact reveals a door, apparently concealed within the cliffside all this time, and a mysterious woman, Hildiran, who&#x27;s now investigating what&#x27;s going on.

                    <span>What if you were a tiny little semi-sentient program running through a mainframe? Well, that&#x27;s basically what&#x27;s going on in Recompile - a Metroidvania-inspired 3D platformer that&#x27;s due to release later this year. 
Recompile was originally planned for release in 2020, but as announced during Gamespot&#x27;s Play for All showcase, it&#x27;s now set to launch this August. Players take on the role of a computer virus that&#x27;s trying to escape deletion. It&#x27;s got snappy combat, generous amounts of mobility and plenty of hacking-themed puzzles - as I discovered when I tried it out at EGX Rezzed in 2019. 
Oh, also there are some pretty spectacular visual effects going on, as you can see from the latest trailer:

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone on PlayStation 4 received a surprise update this week to enable 120fps on PlayStation 5 via backwards compatibility, but it can be tricky to actually make work.
Fans soon discovered that in order to get 120fps on the battle royale, you have to turn off HDR (high-dynamic-range imaging) on the PS5.
I had a chat with Rich from Digital Foundry and he verified this is the case. Disabling HDR is the only way to get Warzone working at 120fps on PS5.

                    <span>Elden Ring finally stepped out of the shadows with a proper trailer and several chunky interviews during E3 week, but one person we hadn&#x27;t heard from on the subject was, of course, George R.R. Martin. The Game of Thrones author has been involved in some of the writing for Elden Ring, and now we&#x27;ve finally heard a little more about his contributions from the man himself. 
Martin recently visited Northwestern University&#x27;s Medill School of Journalism (where he studied in the &#x27;70s) to receive an honorary doctorate, and during the visit spoke to local news station WWTW about his career... including Elden Ring. He didn&#x27;t exactly provide any shocking revelations, but confirmed he&#x27;d mainly been involved in the early stages of development and creating the game&#x27;s fantasy world. 
&quot;The game is called the Elden Ring and it&#x27;s a sequel to a video game that came out a few years ago called Dark Souls,&quot; Martin said. &quot;My work on it was actually done years ago. These games, they&#x27;re like movies, they take a long time to develop.

Nintendo customer support is aware of the problem, and there is a page of troubleshooting tips to follow if you encounter the issue&#x27;s error code: 2123-1502.
Fans I&#x27;ve spoken to say customer support is helping as best it can, but that repeating the above &quot;possible solutions&quot; per-download is meant as a temporary solution at present.

The update, which brings with it the next chapter in the Shadowlands story, adds a new zone called Korthia. This area, which the Jailer has pulled into the Maw, includes a number of new quests.
There&#x27;s a new mega-dungeon called Tazavesh, The Veiled Market. &quot;Explore the exotic wares, merchants, and creatures of this Broker bazaar, which culminates in a high-stakes heist involving powerful artifacts from Azeroth,&quot; Blizzard said.

Bowser&#x27;s Airship is one of the largest Super Mario sets we&#x27;ve seen so far. Clocking in at over 14 inches, this 1152-piece addition provides one of the best-looking builds of the entire range.
There&#x27;s no official launch date yet, and Amazon&#x27;s product listing page has now been deleted. Still, we&#x27;d expect it to arrive in August alongside the upcoming Super Luigi Starter Kit and the third wave of blind bag add-ons announced officially earlier this week.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 4 launched yesterday, and with it brought a new vehicle - and the return of an old exploit.
Season 4 added a new armored cargo truck to the game - itself a controversial addition due to how strong the vehicle is, particularly in solo battle royale. But it got a lot worse when it soon emerged the truck could be used to turn invisible.
To be fair to developer Raven, it moved quickly to pull the truck from the game, thus eradicating the invisibility glitch.

                    <span>Flight Simulator is primed to make its highly anticipated Xbox Series X/S debut in just over a month, but, before that, there&#x27;s another huge World Update for PC players, arriving today and giving makeovers to the sim&#x27;s rendition of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.
Developer Asobo is promising pilots the chance to explore &quot;vast fjords, riveting urban vistas, domineering peaks, and centuries-old iconic castles&quot; in its new Nordic countries update, which also brings landscape enhancements, improved regional architecture, five new airports, improved data for 100 airports, and over 78 new points of interest.
Once the World Update is downloaded (first update the sim, then grab the World Update from the in-game Marketplace) players will also have the opportunity to tackle five new bush trips - one for each of the new Nordic countries - plus five new landing challenges, focussed on Denmark&#x27;s Bornholm, Iceland&#x27;s Ísafjörður, Sweden&#x27;s Stockholm Arlanda, Norway&#x27;s Svalbard, and Finland&#x27;s Vaasa Airports.

                    <span>Xbox Design Lab was temporarily suspended last October while Microsoft worked on transitioning between console generations, but the custom controller service is back - allowing you to design your own Series X/S controller. 
The relaunch was announced during Xbox&#x27;s E3 follow-up showcase this evening, and the Xbox Design Lab website is now up and running. The customisation program allows you to pick colours for most external parts of the controller, including the &quot;body, back case, D-pad, bumpers, triggers, thumbsticks, ABXY, View, Menu and Share buttons.&quot; The Xbox Wire blog post says there are 18 colours to choose from, including the colours of existing Xbox Series X/S controllers like Shock Blue and Pulse Red.   
If you want to make it extra personal, you can also get your controller engraved with a Gamertag or custom message of up to 16 characters.

                    <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; next major free update is packing in one hell of a crossover, bringing the world of Disney&#x27;s Pirates of the Caribbean into Rare&#x27;s swashbuckling multiplayer adventure. And if the arrival of Captain Jack Sparrow wasn&#x27;t enough to be excited about, it&#x27;s also finally giving the formidable kraken a face - which makes an appearance in a brand-new trailer.
The centrepiece of Sea of Thieves&#x27; Pirates of the Caribbean crossover - officially known as A Pirate&#x27;s Life - takes the form of a brand-new cinematic story campaign. It features five new Tall Tales episodes (the first since March 2020&#x27;s Heart of Flame), charting Jack Sparrow&#x27;s arrival in the Sea of Thieves and the events that ensue.
There are tantalising snatches of those adventures in Rare&#x27;s second crossover trailer below, including the appearance of Davy Jones and his formidable vessel the Flying Dutchman, battles against gargantuan mermaid statues, and even a portable talking skull that should stir fond memories for Monkey Island aficionados.

As ever, if you play on Xbox Series X you&#x27;ll just get these enhancements on that date with no extra fuss. Microsoft announced the update tonight, during its E3 Xbox Showcase: Extended event.

                    <span>Ninja Theory has released a new video for Xbox exclusive Hellblade 2, and provided an update on its development.
The video, below, does not include any gameplay or any new footage of the game save some hard to make out snippets. It begins instead with a message from Ninja Theory chief Tameem Antoniades, who discusses the work that&#x27;s being done to make Hellblade 2 at the Microsoft-owned studio&#x27;s new digs in Cambridge. The video then goes on to present a rather disturbing montage that sets the scene.
I get the impression Hellblade 2 is still a long way off. In the video, Antoniades says Ninja Theory is currently building &quot;a good chunky slice of the game before we then move into full production to build out the rest&quot;.

                    <span>If you were wondering just how popular PUBG is on mobile, the answer is: very, as 17 million people have now signed up for upcoming mobile title PUBG: New State. 
PUBG: New State was announced back in February and described as the &quot;only mobile successor to the original PC version of PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;. It&#x27;s a futuristic version of PUBG set after the events of the original game, in the year 2051. It&#x27;s supposed to have &quot;ultra-realistic graphics&quot; that will surpass &quot;what was previously possible in mobile gaming graphics&quot;, along with some new game mechanics like dodging, drone calls and support requests. 
Pre-registration was opened up following the game&#x27;s announcement, with players able to register their interest via Google Play and the App Store. And it seems to have received a lot of attention, judging by the numbers announced by PUBG Corp today.

&quot;While not the most ambitious sequel, Overcooked 2 still ranks among the best couch co-op has to offer,&quot; kitchen master Johnny Chiodini wrote, recommending the game in Eurogamer&#x27;s Overcooked! 2 review.

                    <span>Well, another Cyberpunk 2077 patch has arrived, and although this one doesn&#x27;t bring any spectacular gameplay additions it does promise further bug fixes and stability improvements.
Patch 1.23 is now live on all platforms, and sorts out a number of quest-specific bugs and general performance issues. The patch itself is apparently rather chunky, with console users reporting a download size of 30GB (my Steam download was a rather more modest 3.45GB).  
Of note is the paragraph on stability and performance, which says the patch will provide &quot;numerous crash fixes in animations, UI, scene, physics and gameplay systems&quot;. The patch also promises a reduction in the number of crashes through &quot;memory optimisations and memory management improvements in various systems&quot;. There&#x27;s also a vague mention of &quot;various console CPU optimisations&quot;.

Cross-platform play and cross-save are planned, the latter of which requires you use the same Nintendo Account or Pokémon Trainer Club log-in. 
Here&#x27;s a new trailer showing the game&#x27;s opening cinematic and fresh gameplay:

&quot;Later this year, we&#x27;re rolling out another major system update packed with new features, and we want your help testing them out!&quot; Sony said in a post on the PlayStation Blog.
You can register your interest for the beta program now on the PlayStation website. It&#x27;s open to players over the age of 18 in the US, Canada, Japan, UK, Germany and France.

                    <span>It sounds like a dystopian nightmare, yet it&#x27;s fast becoming a reality: Facebook has announced it&#x27;s going to start testing in-headset VR adverts. 
Facebook initially started testing adverts on the Oculus mobile app last month, but it&#x27;s now taking things a step further by trialling adverts inside the Oculus Quest VR headset. The adverts are first being tested in a game called Blaston by Resolution Games, and will roll out to a couple of other apps &quot;over the coming weeks&quot;. 
Judging by a gif on the Oculus blog showing an in-headset advert, it looks like players can point at an advert to click on a link or save it for later. There&#x27;s also a drop-down menu to report and hide ads, and an option to tweak user preferences.

                    <span>Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s creator Scott Cawthon has announced he is retiring, just days after a controversy erupted over his past donations to Republican candidates, including Donald Trump. 
Cawthon confirmed his decision in a statement shared to ScottGames.com, accompanied by Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s artwork drawn by an unnamed eight-year-old fan.
There&#x27;s no mention of the controversy in his statement, save for a reference to him receiving support from the LGBTQ community - a nod to the recent criticism faced by him for supporting Republican candidates with broadly anti-LGBTQ stances.

It adds spectator mode and cross-platform multiplayer as Tetris Effect: Connected launches on PlayStation 4 late July.
Cross-platform multiplayer applies to ranked match, friend match and multiplayer leaderboards. There is no cross-platform progress or saves, and you can turn cross-platform play off if you wish.

Now the dust has settled, some excellent fan theories have emerged about what&#x27;s going on - especially regarding Link&#x27;s seemingly-corrupted arm. 

In a thread on Twitter about Link&#x27;s appendage, freelance writer and Eurogamer contributor 
Jordan Oloman highlighted how Link appears to lose his arm at the beginning of the trailer, before it appears to be restored with Sheikah technology.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone has become the first PlayStation 4 backwards compatible game to support 120hz on PlayStation 5.
Season 4 launched this morning, and buried within the patch notes is word Warzone now has 120hz support for PS5. This requires HDMI 2.1.
It&#x27;s a surprise but welcome addition, and hopefully heralds similar updates from other PS4 games running in back compat form on PS5.

Now, we know what these figurines will do when you first scan them into the game.
The pack&#x27;s Samus amiibo will add an extra energy tank to your health, increasing its overall capacity by 100 HP. These permanent power-ups are often hard to find in Metroid games, but you&#x27;ll get one easily here.

                    <span>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a mobile data standard that was widely used in the early 2000s. The first encryption algorithm for that standard was GEA-1, a stream cipher built on three linear-feedback shift registers and a non-linear combining function. Although the algorithm has a 64-bit key, the effective key length is only 40 bits, due to “an exceptional interaction of the deployed LFSRs and the key initialization, which is highly unlikely to occur by chance.”
GEA-1 was designed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute in 1998. ETSI was — and maybe still is — under the auspices of ...</span>

However, Nintendo has now made up for that no-show, sharing 20 minutes of new gameplay in a special Nintendo Treehouse livestream.
Announced back in 2019, No More Heroes 3 - which is set nine years after the events of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle and two years after Travis Strikes Again - once again casts players as otaku and sometime-assassin Travis Touchdown. However, while previous games saw Travis murdering his way to the top of the United Assassins Association league, this third series entry ushers in a new threat, with players now charged with eliminating extraterrestrial enemies in order to reach number one in the Galactic Superhero Rankings.
As seen in Nintendo&#x27;s new &quot;early look&quot; at No More Heroes 3, the series&#x27; wonderfully satisfying hack-and-slash action - built around Travis&#x27; lightsaber-like Beam Katana - makes a return, with no obvious surprises where core mechanics are concerned. Players will again need to combine the likes of basic moves, heavy moves, kicks, blocks, and rolls to defeat enemies (motion controls are optional) with the likes of finishers and jackpot bonuses also returning.
