                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s big Monster Hunter Wilds reveal in December might have been eye-catching, but it was a little light on detail; but now, new leaks have shed a little more light on the developer&#x27;s plans, claiming this latest series instalment will be fully open world and launching in Q1 2025.


That&#x27;s according to reliable leaker Dusk Golem, who recently shared a few scraps of fresh Monster Hunter Wilds information over on Discord. Perhaps the biggest claim is that - as had been speculated following December&#x27;s striking trailer reveal - Wilds will be &quot;fully open world&quot; rather than segmented into discrete explorable areas as was the case in previous games.


&quot;That was [Capcom&#x27;s] idea from day one apparently,&quot; Dusk Golem wrote, &quot;the entire game revolves around it, from story to endgame.&quot; They also say Wilds has been in development since 2019, and will feature &quot;a lot of the scrapped ideas from World&quot;. Additionally, it&#x27;s claimed Wilds&#x27; director (Yuya Tokuda, who also helmed Monster Hunter World) has been given &quot;complete freedom [for the development of Wilds], pretty much no questions asked.&quot;

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss who might pick up the baton and develop a potential Baldur&#x27;s Gate 4 - now that BG3 studio Larian has confirmed it is leaving the franchise behind. 
The rights to Baldur&#x27;s Gate of course belong to Wizards of the Coast, who are free to enlist another studio to make further games in the Dungeons and Dragons universe - and even use Larian&#x27;s characters. And considering how well BG3 has been received, it would seem financially prudent for a publisher to mount some kind of follow-up at some point. Perhaps BioWare might like to give it another go?
Alternatively you could argue - and Larian&#x27;s own Swen Vincke has done so - that there really shouldn&#x27;t need to be a Baldur&#x27;s Gate 4 at all. BG3 was great, but why does that mean there has to be more? Joining me this week to discuss are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

The game will feature turn-based card battles set in a dystopian &quot;feudal cityscape&quot;.

The studio&#x27;s director Maddy Thorson shared a new update and while &quot;this game ain&#x27;t coming out in 2024&quot;, progress is not &quot;stagnant&quot; and the team is &quot;still excited to work on it&quot;.



Game designer Kyle Pulver has now joined the development team - Pulver has worked on a number of small projects and was world champion of TowerFall.

In a new video posted by Canadian Guy Eh - an insider known for their coverage of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon - the YouTuber said he&#x27;d heard from multiple sources at PAX East that Toys for Bob is working on a new Spyro title.
&quot;Spyro 4 is in development. That&#x27;s a statement. No theory crafting, no evidence-based assumptions, no conspiracies, or even a heavy-handed hint,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Twitch has once again updated its community guidelines to prohibit sexualised content, this time preventing streamers using their bodies as a green screen.



From 29th March, &quot;content that focuses on intimate body parts for a prolonged period of time&quot; won&#x27;t be allowed, defined as buttocks, groin, or breasts.


&quot;Content on Twitch is always evolving, and we want to make sure our rules work as intended and keep up with emerging behaviours,&quot; reads a post from Twitch on social media site X. &quot;When needed, we make updates to our rules to capture those shifts in behaviour, and so it&#x27;s clear to the community what is allowed.&quot;

                              <span>Sony has successfully won a patent infringement lawsuit in which it was being sued for $500m, after a US District Court judge ruled in the PlayStation company&#x27;s favour.


The lawsuit was based on Sony&#x27;s controller-to-console communication method, with Genuine Enabling Technology - a company with a history of lawsuits over technology patents - seeking $500m in damages. GET initially filed a complaint against the company back in 2017, claiming Sony had infringed on its patent. 
Specifically, this patent was entitled &#x27;Method and Apparatus for Producing a Combined Data Stream and Recovering Therefrom the Respective User Input Stream and at Least One Input Signal&#x27;.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 developer Capcom has begun quizzing fans on what they&#x27;d like to see in future DLC for the game. 


A public user survey is now available to complete, and asks whether you would be interested in purchasing extra content for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 if it was released. A follow-up question then asks what you&#x27;d like to see in that future DLC, and how much you might pay for it.


The topic of DLC has been a hot-button issue for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, after the game received backlash at  launch for an array of paid unlocks to make the experience easier (although all items you can buy can also be found in-game, albeit in more limited amounts).

                              <span>Sega will shed 240 staff across its European studios, and sell off Company of Heroes developer Relic Entertainment as part of a cost-cutting drive.


The majority of job losses will be at Total War developer Creative Assembly and at the publisher&#x27;s Sega Europe office. These follow earlier cuts to the UK-based Creative Assembly last year, after the cancellation of live-service shooter Hyenas.


The Vancouver-based Relic will become an independent studio, meanwhile, backed by an unnamed &quot;external investor&quot;. In a statement posted to social media this morning, Relic confirmed Company of Heroes 3 support would continue. The developer has also recently faced layoffs, with 121 staff let go in May 2023.

                              <span>Embracer has entered an agreement to sell Gearbox Interactive to Take-Two for $460m.
When this transaction is complete, Take-Two will acquire the Borderlands and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands franchises, as well as Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms and Duke Nukem. Closing is expected to be finalised in Q1 FY 24/25, ending June 2024.
Following this, Embracer will still retain a number of assets such as Lost Boys, which Gearbox acquired in 2022.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not often we get to hear a senior developer of a Super Mario Bros. game philosophise about game design. At gamescom last year, Takashi Tezuka, executive officer at Nintendo and producer on Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and Shiro Mouri, the game&#x27;s director, gave us a glimpse, as they spoke with Eurogamer about their intentions for Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
At the time, Tezuka said &quot;There was a lot of feeling about creating something else, something new,&quot; with Mouri adding that &quot;in terms of the concept for creating a new Mario, we came up with the concept of mystery and secrets&quot;.
Much of that was echoed by the pair&#x27;s talk at GDC last week: Tezuka noted the team&#x27;s mantra this time was &quot;Big Changes,&quot; while Mouri mentioned the sense of lingering familiarity again, and the desire to evolve things in light of it. Only this time they opened up a little further, offering detail on cut ideas, development approaches and more - but they began with the same point they made to us.

                              <span>Images allegedly showing the white, digital-only Xbox Series X reported to be in the works earlier this year have leaked online.


An &quot;adorably all-digital&quot; Xbox Series X refresh, planned for a 2024 release, first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year&#x27;s court battle with the FTC. Despite Xbox boss Phil Spencer later downplaying the leak, a report surfaced in February claiming not only was Microsoft&#x27;s all-digital Xbox Series X still alive, it was aiming to release &quot;sometime between the upcoming months of June and July&quot;.


That claim was made by noted leaker eXtas1s, who has now resurfaced with (extremely low-resolution) images allegedly showing a seemingly near-release version of the all-digital console.

                              <span>Europa, the absolutely lovely looking Ghibli-inspired exploration adventure from developer Helder Pinto, has been delayed - and will now likely launch for PC this &quot;summer&quot;.


Europa - a &quot;peaceful game of adventure, exploration, and meditation&quot; set on a terraformed moon in Jupiter&#x27;s shadow - has been in the works since 2017 (Pinto, a former principle art lead at Blizzard has described it as a &quot;passion project&quot;), but it finally got a release date at the end of last year, with the team aiming to launch on 16th April 2024.


However, with that date just weeks away now, Pinto has made the decision to push Europa&#x27;s release back by a couple of months, &quot;probably until summer&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo has reportedly cut 120 contractor testing roles at its North American operation - with an unspecified number said to have been converted to full-time positions - as part of a major restructuring effort that comes amid claims of a testing &quot;lull&quot; ahead of Switch 2&#x27;s arrival.


That&#x27;s according to Kotaku, which describes the restructuring - based on word from a number of former and current contractors - as a &quot;massive downsizing&quot; of Nintendo&#x27;s Washington-based games and hardware testing team. While the publication&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t put a number on the job cuts, reporter Ethan Gach said he understands &quot;roughly 120 contractor positions have been eliminated at Nintendo of America&quot; in a follow-up post on social media.


In a statement confirming its restructuring, Nintendo told Kotaku it had reorganised its Product Testing functions to &quot;drive greater global integration in game development efforts&quot; and &quot;better align [Nintendo of America] with interregional testing procedures and operations.&quot;

                              <span>Vampire survival game V Rising is getting an official Castlevania collaboration, introducing vampire hunter Simon Belmont and a range of series-inspired cosmetics, in May.


V Rising&#x27;s Castlevania collaboration consists of two parts; legendary vampire hunter Simon Belmont will be available as a boss fight for all players in the base game - anyone that manages to overcome his holy arsenal and defeat him unlocks the new whip weapon - and he&#x27;s accompanied by the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack DLC.


This paid cosmetic DLC enables players to give their vampiric castle hangouts a bit of a Castlevania makeover with decor and trimmings inspired by the series. This includes the option to use two classic series themes - reimagined by V Rising composer Aleksandria Migova - as castle music. Additionally, the DLC includes new character customisation options inspired by familiar Castlevania characters, and a skeletal mount.

                              <span>It’s yet another hardware side-channel attack:
The threat resides in the chips’ data memory-dependent prefetcher, a hardware optimization that predicts the memory addresses of data that running code is likely to access in the near future. By loading the contents into the CPU cache before it’s actually needed, the DMP, as the feature is abbreviated, reduces latency between the main memory and the CPU, a common bottleneck in modern computing. DMPs are a relatively new phenomenon found only in M-series chips and Intel’s 13th-generation Raptor Lake microarchitecture, although older forms of prefetchers have been common for years...</span>

                              <span>Yellow Brick Games, the studio founded by former Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw, has released a teaser trailer for its &quot;ambitious new action RPG&quot;, ahead of a full reveal in April.


Laidlaw announced the formation of Yellow Brick Games at the tail-end of 2020, following a brief stint at Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey studio Ubisoft Quebec. Prior to that, he&#x27;d worked on some of BioWare&#x27;s most beloved titles before departing the studio in 2018 after 15 years.


Little has been formally revealed about Yellow Brick Games&#x27; debut title beyond the fact it&#x27;ll be an &quot;ambitious new action RPG&quot;, but that&#x27;s all about to change. The developer has now shared a 22-second teaser trailer, offering a first look at the still-unnamed project&#x27;s gently stylised fantasy world, in the run-up to a proper unveiling very soon.

                              <span>It Takes Two - the co-op platformer from Hazelight and Josef Fares (yes, of that Oscars rant) - celebrated its third anniversary earlier this week.
To commemorate the occasion, Hazelight shared a new piece of artwork and the news It Takes Two had now sold 16m copies. This is an increase of six million sales over the last 12 months.
The developer said its game has now been played by over 30 million people, a statistic it called &quot;mind blowing&quot;. It Takes Two is also available on Game Pass.

                              <span>Microsoft is adding the ability to use a mouse and keyboard to its suite of games available through Xbox Cloud Gaming via browser, or the Xbox App on Windows PCs.


For now, only a small number of games offer mouse and keyboard support, and only for Xbox Insider members testing new features via the early Alpha Skip-Ahead ring. The option will then be rolled out to more players in the future.


Currently supported titles from Microsoft include Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Pentiment and Halo Infinite. Other big-name games include Fortnite (through a browser only) and ARK Survival Evolved.

                              <span>Orbital, the 27th major update to No Man&#x27;s Sky, will arrive today and revamp the game&#x27;s space stations. 


These deep space locations can now be &quot;vast, procedurally generated, and incredibly diverse&quot;, developer Hello Games said today, announcing the update. The aim is for space stations to feel bigger, more individual, and offer new activities and shops for you to explore. It&#x27;s here you&#x27;ll also find the new Guild system, with envoys to visit.


Advancements to space stations mean No Man&#x27;s Sky can also now offer customisation for basic spaceships. The long-requested addition of a ship editor means you can now gather and trade parts and cobble together all-new ship types. Here&#x27;s how it all looks in action:

In a press release to coincide with the launch of Bulwark: The Falconeer Chronicles across PC, PlayStation and Xbox, Sala and publisher Wired Productions revealed work on a third instalment had already begun. 


For now, the third entry is being worked on under the codename Project Ancient Waves. While details are still thin on the ground, Sala said the game will &quot;attempt to bring the perspective of the grand world, created over the first two releases, down to a human scale&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to Panic, the hardware maker behind the palm-sized, crank-operated console, with company co-founder Cabel Sasser calling it &quot;a bit of a true crime drama&quot; (thanks, Game File).


Sasser spoke at GDC last week, when he revealed this news, stating pallets containing the consoles had gone missing in Las Vegas. Panic, he said, was still trying to track them down.

Writing on social media platform X this week, Mass Effect 5 executive producer Mike Gamble highlighted some of the upcoming project&#x27;s experienced leadership when responding to a fan who questioned whether anyone on the game had worked on the original Mass Effect trilogy.


&quot;EP, Art Director, Creative Director, Game Director are all trilogy vets,&quot; was Gamble&#x27;s response.

The high speed racer was a launch game for the Game Boy Advance and took its cue from the SNES original with its flat, twisting tracks and pixel graphics. It was generally well regarded on release, alongside the likes of Castlevania: Circle of the Moon and Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2.

Speaking with Polygon, Spencer said he would like to break down the &#x27;walled gardens&#x27; that limit players to buying games on a particular platform&#x27;s official digital store. 


&quot;[Consider] our history as the Windows company,&quot; he explained. &quot;Nobody would blink twice if I said &#x27;hey, when you&#x27;re using a PC, you get to decide the type of experience you have [by picking where to buy games]&#x27;. There&#x27;s real value in that.&quot;

The Xbox boss presided over the departure of 1900 people across Xbox and Activision Blizzard in January of this year, a decision he described at the time as being one aimed at achieving &quot;a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business&quot;. 


Across the video games industry as a whole, more than 15,000 people are thought to have been let go over the past 18 months.

                              <span>The next expansion for MMORPG Final Fantasy 14, Dawntrail, is up for pre-order, but the process has been beset with issues.


It began with failed card payments when pre-ordering on the Square Enix Store, which Square Enix acknowledged. In a post on X, it suggested using PayPal instead and then stated transaction difficulties had been resolved, before admitting some issues persisted. Using the &#x27;Guest Checkout&#x27; was recommended instead.


And that was if users could even reach the store. The website was unable to cope with the amount of traffic, meaning fans were beset with error messages before even reaching card payments.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 10 years since BioShock Infinite, and creator Ken Levine is still not done with follow-up project Judas. But the game is inching closer, evidenced recently by its appearance in trailers and now, a marketing beat where select people such as Game Awards host Geoff Keighley have now played it for several hours. 


On the surface, this is a BioShock game in all but name, with gunplay  and elemental powers in an offbeat alternate universe setting. And this is essentially what trailers have shown us of the game so far. 


Now, Levine has discussed how this all fits with his long-standing desire to make a game from &quot;narrative Lego&quot; - essentially, from hand-crafted bits that are combined differently each time you play.

                              <span>Diablo 4 is set to make its Game Pass debut this Thursday, 28th March.
Ahead of this, Microsoft has laid out a step-by-step guide explaining how PC players can get it all set up, because there are more steps than you may have perhaps expected.
PC players looking to dive into Sanctuary later this month will need to make sure they have set themselves up on Battle.net - Blizzard&#x27;s digital distribution service - before they can play the game.

                              <span>It’s pretty devastating:
Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call Unsaflok. The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries. By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba’s encryption and the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain piece of the lock’s data, and the second opens it...</span>

                              <span>Sony is introducing a new Community Game Help feature on PlayStation 5.
This opt-in feature, which is an evolution of the console&#x27;s Game Help function, will create gameplay clips automatically, which will in turn help other players with their own gaming endeavours.
If users choose to contribute to the Community Game Help feature, their PS5 will capture a gameplay clip when an activity within a supported title is completed. &quot;Then, it will be reviewed by a moderator, and if approved, your video will be published as a Game Help hint for PlayStation players to watch, learn from, and rate,&quot; Sony&#x27;s Sabrina Meditz explained in a blog post detailing the forthcoming update.

                              <span>For many, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is still seen as a kind of Breath of the Wild 1.5 - a half-sequel that builds on 2017&#x27;s revolutionary hit but, in using the same Hyrule as its overworld, doesn&#x27;t fully transform it into something new.
The Zelda developers at Nintendo would probably disagree. In a packed-out talk at GDC last week - which may go down as one of the conference&#x27;s great talks of the last few years - technical director Takuhiro Dohta, lead physics engineer Takahiro Takayama, and sound programmer Junya Osada explained the complexity and sheer scale of the task at hand.
The goal, they said, was to take the two central ideas of Breath of the Wild - the notion of a &quot;vast and seamless Hyrule&quot; as one; the other its &quot;multiplicative gameplay&quot;, where physics and chemistry combine to give you new solutions in-game - and expand on them. (As well as, crucially, enabling you to &quot;dig holes,&quot; a much-memed desire of the series&#x27; legendary producer Eiji Aounouma.)

                              <span>Lego Fortnite gets its second major update today, with the arrival of vehicles to build and drive around. 


The survival crafting game, playable within Fortnite, now lets you zoom about its world in a variety of vehicles you can build and customise. These range from the single-seat Speeder quad bike to the four-seat Offroader buggy, to the huge Hauler flat-bed truck.


Vehicles are cobbled together using a selection of new parts: power cells, wheels and seats. You will need to keep your vehicles fuelled, but pleasingly, all fuel in Lego Fortnite is eco-friendly, and generated as biomass from the new Compost Bin station.

As shared in the company&#x27;s annual report, the Control spin-off has an initial development budget of €25m and is being built on Remedy&#x27;s own engine, Northlight. 


The game entered production readiness at the end of last year, and will release across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (although, the developer has not said when we can expect it to arrive).

Speaking to IGN, Vincke also mentioned plans to feature a wider range of locations in the game - including several that will be familiar to Dungeons and Dragons players. 


If you&#x27;re still playing (I&#x27;m only just on Act 3!), a final warning that Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 plot details follow.

                              <span>It is understood the &quot;majority&quot; of Xbox games will eventually be coming to PlayStation. 


That&#x27;s according to Chris Dring from Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz. Speaking on the GI Microcast, Dring said his takeaway from GDC was that &quot;Xbox is in real trouble as a hardware manufacturer&quot;. Sources who spoke to Dring during the conference last week said that &quot;Xbox&#x27;s performance in Europe is just flatlining&quot;, and some publishers were now expressing concerns about supporting the console. 


&quot;The phrase one major company who released a big game last year said [was], &#x27;I don&#x27;t know why we bothered supporting it&#x27;,&quot; Dring shared. &quot;We mentioned on a previous podcast that we&#x27;d heard retailers in Europe are considering or had already been cutting back their Xbox stock on their shelves - hardware, games, that kind of thing - and now you&#x27;ve got third-party publishers going, &#x27;we&#x27;re putting in a lot of effort trying to create a Series S version and an X version of a game when, to be honest with you, for us the market is PC and PS5&#x27;.&quot;

                              <span>Xbox gaming boss Phil Spencer has discussed the idea of a Microsoft handheld games device, and how Xbox games should play on third-party handheld hardware.


Spencer, a keen handheld PC enthusiast, told Polygon that Microsoft was discussing &quot;different hardware form factors and things that [they] could go do&quot; to grow the Xbox audience further.


&quot;What should we build that will find new players?&quot; Spencer mused. &quot;That will allow people to play at times when they couldn&#x27;t go play [in the past]?&quot;

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is full of surprises, and players are still working to discover all of them. Chief of interest at the moment is the curious Dragonsplague affliction that can be acquired by Pawns - and cause the loss of an entire town in one evening.
Players believe Dragonsplague can be contracted by Pawns after they fight against a dragon - but the condition can also be passed between Pawns, too.
If ignored, the consequences can be &quot;devastating&quot;, Capcom warns. The official Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 website describes Dragonsplague as a &quot;contagious disease-like condition that infects pawns as they travel between worlds&quot;.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we digest the last seven days of headlines from GDC 2024 - a conference that was unsurprisingly coloured by the past 18 months of industry turmoil. Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell was there, and joins us today to report back on what was being said on the ground. 
From this side of the pond, we saw the widespread anger at mass layoffs and the scepticism surrounding AI. But what was the mood at GDC 2024 really like - and how did game developers there actually feel? Chris fills us in on what he heard - and why, at a conference filled with dozens of developers presenting their best work, the mood wasn&#x27;t exclusively doom and gloom.
Take a listen to hear Chris&#x27; favourite moments from the show - plus renditions of a Mario power-up sound effect from him and Newscast regular Victoria Kennedy. Blup-blup-blup!

                              <span>Andrew Appel shepherded a public comment—signed by twenty election cybersecurity experts, including myself—on best practices for ballot marking devices and vote tabulation. It was written for the Pennsylvania legislature, but it’s general in nature.
From the executive summary:
We believe that no system is perfect, with each having trade-offs. Hand-marked and hand-counted ballots remove the uncertainty introduced by use of electronic machinery and the ability of bad actors to exploit electronic vulnerabilities to remotely alter the results. However, some portion of voters mistakenly mark paper ballots in a manner that will not be counted in the way the voter intended, or which even voids the ballot. Hand-counts delay timely reporting of results, and introduce the possibility for human error, bias, or misinterpretation...</span>

Cyberpunk 2077 will be available free from this Thursday 28th March at 3pm UK time, until Monday 1st April at 7.59am. 

No subscription is required to access the free trial, meaning you won&#x27;t need PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass. But, unfortunately, you will be limited to five hours&#x27; worth of game time within the free play window. There&#x27;s also no word of a similar offer on PC.

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls 6 exists as a work-in-progress early build, Bethesda has confirmed, in a brief statement which notes the game is now very much &quot;in development&quot;.


&quot;Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement and promise of adventure,&quot; the company wrote in a message released today to celebrate the series&#x27; 30th anniversary.


Word that The Elder Scrolls 6 is on the way is no surprise, of course. Bethesda first confirmed it would make the game six years ago, when it released a CGI teaser trailer back at E3 2018. But it was clear at the time that Bethesda had other things to finish first - such as last year&#x27;s sci-fi RPG Starfield.

                              <span>Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition was released on PC last week, and has seen a respectable number of players flocking to partake in Aloy&#x27;s latest outing.
The Horizon sequel and its Burning Shores DLC currently has a concurrent player peak of 40,462 on Steam - ahead of other big Sony games such as The Last of Us Part 1, which has had a peak of 36,496 concurrent players.
Forbidden West player numbers still sit a touch behind its predecessor Zero Dawn, however. The first Horizon game, which came to Steam back in 2020, boasts a concurrent player peak of 56,557. Meanwhile, no Sony-published game is close to surpassing juggernaut Helldivers 2, which quickly became PlayStation&#x27;s biggest Steam launch ever and currently has an all-time concurrent peak of over 458,000 players.

                              <span>If you have been following the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 discourse over the last few days, you will be aware of the game&#x27;s paid DLC. On release, developer Capcom introduced a number of items that players could purchase with real-world money, such as the Art of Metamorphosis - Character Editor DLC, which costs £1.69.
While many of these purchasable items are also available to find within the game itself, they can be relatively rare, perhaps making the option to just outright purchase them more appealing.
However, modders have now done what they do best, and given players on PC a third option. Yes, the option of mods.

                              <span>A senior staff member behind the continually-delayed Ubisoft shooter XDefiant has denied a report which claimed the game&#x27;s late launch was due to developers &quot;chasing Call of Duty&quot;. 


Writing on social media platform X, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin - who previously held the same position at Call of Duty: Modern Warfare studio Infinity Ward - addressed a new Insider Gaming report that claims the game&#x27;s developers are becoming creatively frustrated by demands they must &quot;copy&quot; features found in Call of Duty. 


&quot;Just FYI, nothing about our delay is due to any new features,&quot; Rubin wrote. &quot;In fact not much has changed from a gameplay standpoint. The delay has been due to the tech issues we&#x27;ve talked about.&quot;

                              <span>Capcom has laid out its plans for future Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 updates.
The developer will be adding new features such as the option to start a new game when save data already exists and changing up the number of Art of Metamorphosis items available to buy at Pawn Guilds to 99. These particular updates will be available across PlayStation, Xbox and PC.
Meanwhile, specifically on PS5 and Xbox, players will soon be able to switch ray tracing and motion blur on or off. There will also be the option to set Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s frame rate to either Variable or to a 30fps cap. Those playing on Steam will get improved visuals with DLSS.

Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook owner Meta are all being investigated by the EU under the Digital Market Act (DMA), key legislation designed to keep competition fair.


Both Apple and Google will be investigated over their mobile app stores, which the EU previously ordered must allow greater competition on their respective platforms.

Back in September, Ryan announced he would be retiring from Sony in March, after nearly 30 years with the company. 


Now, to honour the occasion, Sony has released a bobblehead collectible in the exec&#x27;s likeness, which can be obtained through PlayStation Stars (the console&#x27;s loyalty programme where players can earn rewards by completing a variety of campaigns and activities).

&quot;You may have noticed a lot of Final Fantasy 9 references here… And the reason is a secret,&quot; producer/director Naoki &quot;Yoshi-P&quot; Yoshida said via translator during his PAX East panel. He then mimed zipping his mouth closed, and steadfastly refused to reveal anything more. The tease.
It&#x27;s not totally a secret, of course. Some of you may remember that rumours of a remake began when Final Fantasy 9 was one of several unannounced games leaked by the GeForce Now database leak a couple of years back, which also included the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Kingdom Hearts 4, and the Chrono Cross remaster.

                              <span>Dragon Ball Sparkling! Zero has secured an ESRB rating, leading to hopes the game is content-complete and we&#x27;ll get a formal release date soon.
At the same time, eagle-eyed fans have noted that the Bandai Namco Europe YouTube channel has at least one unlisted video – the sister American account does not – leading to speculation that it may be a pre-prepared launch date reveal teaser.
Without formal confirmation from Bandai Namco all of this can only be taken with the requisite bucket full of salt, but some hope that we&#x27;ll know more around 9th May, colloquially known as &quot;Goku Day&quot;.

                              <span>Our first look at the gameplay of Sonic Toys Party – which is a Sonic and Fall Guys-esque mash-up – has popped up online.
YouTuber The Sonic Show has shared an all-new Japanese trailer for the upcoming mobile game, which not only shows the high-octane gameplay, but also some of the game&#x27;s monetisation systems, which looks to include a premium battle pass.

                              <span>The debate over professionalizing software engineers is decades old. (The basic idea is that, like lawyers and architects, there should be some professional licensing requirement for software engineers.) Here’s a law journal article recommending the same idea for AI engineers.
This Article proposes another way: professionalizing AI engineering. Require AI engineers to obtain licenses to build commercial AI products, push them to collaborate on scientifically-supported, domain-specific technical standards, and charge them with policing themselves. This Article’s proposal addresses AI harms at their inception, influencing the very engineering decisions that give rise to them in the first place. By wresting control over information and system design away from companies and handing it to AI engineers, professionalization engenders trustworthy AI by design. Beyond recommending the specific policy solution of professionalization, this Article seeks to shift the discourse on AI away from an emphasis on light-touch, ex post solutions that address already-created products to a greater focus on ex ante controls that precede AI development. We’ve used this playbook before in fields requiring a high level of expertise where a duty to the public welfare must trump business motivations. What if, like doctors, AI engineers also vowed to do no harm?...</span>

&quot;If someone has 10 per cent, this is probably one of the best people we have in the team,&quot; Sasko explained.

                              <span>Spyro studio Toys for Bob has reportedly reached an agreement with Microsoft for its first independent game.
That&#x27;s according to Window Central&#x27;s Jaz Corden, who revealed over the weekend that the deal first teased by studio heads Paul Yan and Avery Lodato has now been finalised.
Toys for Bob - the Activision Blizzard studio behind the likes of Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot 4, and the Spyro remasters - announced it was parting ways with Activision to become an independent company again back in January. It also said that it was &quot;exploring a possible partnership&quot; with Microsoft as development on its new game gets underway.

                              <span>Overwatch 2&#x27;s beleaguered PvE content has reportedly been scrapped.
That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which reported yesterday that following &quot;poor&quot; sales of its prior PvE missions, the company &quot;does not plan to finish&quot; any PvE content currently in development, and will instead &quot;double down&quot; on PvP gameplay.

Talking at PAX East this weekend, producer/director Naoki &quot;Yoshi-P&quot; Yoshida teased that the team had hoped to open in early access a week earlier but then… &quot;Elden Ring DLC…&quot;
&quot;We figured everyone would be interested in playing the Elden Ring DLC,&quot; Yoshi-P said, and then held up one finger. &quot;I&#x27;ll give you one week!&quot;

                              <span>Velan Studios&#x27; director of marketing, Josh Harrison, has one recommendation for studios looking to close down or &quot;sunset&quot; a live-service game: &quot;make a private hosted version of your game&quot;.
Talking at GDC, Harrison said that offering a standalone version of its now shuttered live-service project, Knockout City, was &quot;the single biggest thing [Velan] did to impact the positive reception of the sunset&quot; and not only did it garner positivity from the press and community alike, but it also &quot;keeps the game that everybody worked so hard on alive forever&quot;.
&quot;If you take one thing away from this talk, this is it: Make a private hosted version of your game,&quot; Harrison said at this year&#x27;s GDC (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;It is the single biggest thing that we did to impact the positive reception of the sunset. It got great press, got great reactions from players, and ultimately, it keeps the game that everybody at the studio worked so hard on alive forever, even with the live servers offline.

                              <span>Resident Evil 9 is reportedly being developed as an open-world game.
That&#x27;s according to noted leaker Dusk Golem, who said that following Capcom&#x27;s improvements to the RE Engine when developing open-world experiences like Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, Capcom is eager to capitalise on the expanded tech when making Monster Hunter Wild and Resident Evil 9.
&quot;So here&#x27;s a little tidbit I&#x27;ll share,&quot; Dusk Golem said on X/Twitter. &quot;Capcom often will greenlight new initiatives in threes closer together.

                              <span>Jyamma Games has &quot;officially apologised to the Xbox community&quot; after deciding not to release the soulslike Enotria: The Last Song on Xbox in order to ensure a &quot;superior experience&quot; for players on PC and PS5.
In a press statement, CEO Giacomo Greco apologised for taking so long to tell Xbox players that the game would not be coming to Xbox Series X/S, saying it was a &quot;choice that has just been made&quot; and that &quot;making the release on all platforms would lead to a decrease in the overall quality of the product and a further delay of the same&quot;.
&quot;I want you to know that the delay caused by the launch on the same date of [Elden Ring&#x27;s DLC] gave us the opportunity to take more time to further improve the product, this led to raising the bar and, as CEO, I&#x27;m responsible for the final quality of the product,&quot; Greco said.

                              <span>GTA 6&#x27;s development has reportedly fallen so far behind, the eagerly-anticipated game may miss its 2025 release window.
Anonymous sources have told Kotaku that development on GTA 6 has &quot;fallen behind&quot;, which is allegedly why management has asked developers to return to the office full-time as leadership is worried the game may slip to 2026.
Right now, Rockstar is apparently still &quot;aiming&quot; for a spring (Q2) 2025 release, although the same sources suggest that an autumn (Q3) release seems more realistic.

                              <span>You might have heard: while Larian isn&#x27;t done with updating Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, the studio&#x27;s next game won&#x27;t be Baldur&#x27;s Gate 4 or anything to do with D&amp;D.
But while studio founder and head Swen Vincke mentioned the team was working on &quot;a new thing&quot; in his enjoyably open talk at GDC, it wasn&#x27;t exactly clear what &quot;new&quot; meant. Speaking to Eurogamer at the event however, Vincke elaborated just a little further. The next thing will be &quot;New in the sense that it is different from the things that we&#x27;ve done before.&quot;

It will be &quot;Still familiar enough, but different,&quot; he said, while the &quot;tone, style, way of doing it, are for us certainly new - and I think very appealing. I would love to talk about it already - because I&#x27;m very excited about it - but I can&#x27;t say more. But it&#x27;s new in that sense.&quot;

                              <span>Following the release of Echoes of the Fallen in December, Final Fantasy 16 is set to get its next slice of DLC as soon as April.


Final Fantasy 16: The Rising Tide - which takes place before the ending of the main game - is set to release in just under a month, on 18th April. This expansion will be available to purchase individually or as part of the discounted Expansion Pass on the PlayStation Store. 


&quot;An unmarked letter arrives at the hideaway containing a most curious request: the Dominant of Leviathan, the long-lost Eikon of Water, needs rescue,&quot; Square Enix teases. &quot;To heed this call, Clive and his companions must journey to Mysidia - a hidden land under a blue sky - where they will uncover the tragic history of a forgotten people.&quot; You can check out a new trailer for The Rising Tide below.

Relic Castle was a repository and forum for makers and players of Pokémon fan games, and had gained over 20,000 members in almost 10 years. In a statement posted to X, the Relic Castle website revealed it was served a takedown notice, which it has now complied with.
Navigating to the Relic Castle website now shows the website has been stripped of all of its resources, other than the statement on the home page.

                              <span>Enotria: The Last Song was initially set to release in June, but its launch date is being pushed back by developer Jyamma Games, ensuring it avoids a certain Elden Ring DLC. 


The Italian Soulslike will now release on 21st August, well clear of a clash with the much-anticipated Elden Ring expansion.


As well as announcing the new release date, Jyamma Games also said it was no longer planning to launch Enotria: The Last Song on Xbox alongside other platforms. This is to ensure &quot;a superior experience for PC and PS5 players,&quot; Jyamma Games CEO Giacomo Greco wrote in a statement on Steam. The exec suggested the studio will reassess an Xbox release once the game has launched elsewhere.

                              <span>Shinji Mikami, the legendary developer behind Resident Evil and a string of other classics, has founded a new company. 


Titled as KAMUY Inc., the new company was spotted in a biography for Mikami listed on the official Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered website (thanks, Gematsu). Mikami worked as creative producer on the original Shadows of the Damned game, though is not thought to be directly involved in its upcoming remake.

Mikami announced he was quitting his studio Tango Gameworks in February 2023, after 12 years as its CEO. At the time, it was unclear what Mikami would end up doing next.

The beta&#x27;s delay was one of several announcements developer Grinding Gear Games made during its three-and-a-half-hour-long showcase yesterday. 
The showcase included a reveal of the ranger class from Path of Exile 1 which will be available in the sequel, and details on the next expansion, Necropolis, which will release for the original game on 29th March.

The game&#x27;s 19+ rating was published yesterday on the website for the Game Rating and Administration Committee, the South Korean games rating board, as spotted by reddit user Ajxtt.
According to the GRAC&#x27;s rating guide, a 19+ rating is used when its deemed that a game contains &quot;representations of anti-societal idea, religion and public morals that would be harmful to children under 19 emotionally and physically&quot;.

The stop-motion-style narrative game will arrive across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 16th April. It will also be available on Game Pass.


&quot;Having a release date is incredible and surreal to us! It represents the end of an era: The marathon of bringing this dream of ours to light,&quot; the team at Slow Bros. said following this announcement.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 released today, but despite a swathe of critical reviews full of praise for Capcom&#x27;s action RPG sequel, many players have been left disappointed by unexpected microtransactions and performance issues.
Capcom seemingly added a series of gameplay-affecting microtransactions after the game&#x27;s reviews were published yesterday. This has left many with a bitter taste in their mouths, and Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 currently sits with a &#x27;Mixed&#x27; review average on Steam.
Many of the game&#x27;s 7000+ user reviews on the platform have called the developer out for adding paid DLC into a single-player game. One item allows for you to revive your player. Another has caused upset is the Art of Metamorphosis - Character Editor DLC, which costs £1.69. As its name suggests, this one-time consumable gives users the ability to change the appearance of their Arisen, though Capcom does note players are also able to acquire this item in the game itself.

&quot;I understand there will be disappointment because people fell in love with what we created,&quot; Vincke said of the popular RPG, &quot;but it was a story with a beginning, middle and an end and it doesn&#x27;t need more&quot;. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and its characters &quot;now belong to [Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast],&quot; he said, adding he thinks the properties will be &quot;treated with respect&quot;.

Velan Studios announced the likelihood of layoffs in a statement from the company&#x27;s founders, Guha and Karthik Bala, who said that 46 people out of the team&#x27;s current total of 121 had been given notice their positions may be impacted. 


In the statement, posted to social media platform X, the founders blamed a &quot;major project&quot; being &quot;suddenly cancelled by an external partner, which means we may not be able to maintain our full studio size&quot;.

Finishing up his talk, Vincke said: &quot;I told you at the beginning that we were a company of big ideas. We are not a company that&#x27;s made to create DLCs, expansions. We tried that actually, a few times. We failed every time - it&#x27;s not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.&quot;


Vincke continued, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate will always have a warm spot in our heart. We&#x27;ll forever be proud of it, but we&#x27;re not gonna continue in it. We&#x27;re not gonna make new expansions, which everybody is expecting us to do. We&#x27;re not gonna make Baldur&#x27;s Gate 4, which everyone is expecting us to do. We&#x27;re gonna move on - we&#x27;re gonna move away from D&amp;D and start making a new thing.

                              <span>Despite months in Steam Early Access and hundreds of positive player reviews, Stellaris Nexus is no more. Instead, the spin-off is taking the rare step of rebranding itself - dropping its Stellaris branding entirely - to launch with a new name. 


Announced last year as a speedier version of the 4X genre, the project will now be called Nexus 5X (the fifth &#x27;X&#x27; is for &#x27;eXpress&#x27;).


&quot;The whole point of Early Access is to figure out what about your game works and what needs to be better - and the big lesson for us was that our name needed to be better,&quot; Whataboy Games studio director Dax Ginn told Eurogamer.

                              <span>Still Wakes the Deep, the promising-looking narrative horror game set on an oil rig, will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 18th June.


This is the much-anticipated next project from British studio The Chinese Room, which previously made Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture.


Set on a remote Scottish oil rig in the 1970s, Still Wakes the Deep looks to be an atmospheric period horror piece with a dash of the supernatural and plenty of psychological fear elements. You play as a worker on the platform, initially surrounded by a crew - at least, until disaster strikes.

                              <span>Apple is facing another antitrust lawsuit - this time from the US government.
Earlier today, the US Department of Justice announced it is suing Apple for monopolising the smartphone market. The lawsuit has been filed by the Department of Justice, 15 other state and district attorneys general, and Washington DC, in the District Court of New Jersey. 
In the lawsuit, the Department of Justice alleges Apple engages in an &quot;anticompetitive course of conduct&quot;, using tactics such as making it difficult for consumers to switch to other smartphone platforms, maintaining a closed-off system which is incompatible with apps and peripherals from other companies, and blocking third-party digital wallets. Of most relevant to video games, perhaps, is the claim Apple has blocked the development of cloud-streaming game apps.

                              <span>Capcom has confirmed it is aware of frame rate issues in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 on PC and is looking to improve performance in the future.


The open world RPG is released tomorrow, 22nd March, but does suffer from an inconsistent frame rate when playing on PC.


&quot;In Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, a large amount of CPU usage is allocated to each character and calculating the impact of their physical presence in various areas. In certain situations where numerous characters appear simultaneously, the CPU usage can be very high and may affect the frame rate,&quot; reads a statement from Capcom shared with Eurogamer.

The highest reward for a vulnerability report in 2023 was $113,337, while the total tally since the program’s launch in 2010 has reached $59 million.
For Android, the world’s most popular and widely used mobile operating system, the program awarded over $3.4 million.
Google also increased the maximum reward amount for critical vulnerabilities concerning Android to $15,000, driving increased community reports.

                              <span>Nintendo has been keeping a tight lid on the developer behind Princess Peach: Showtime! since it was announced last year.
However, the credits are now out there, and we can confirm it was developed by the team at Good-Feel, and directed by Etsunobu Ebisu. This marks Ebisu&#x27;s first directorial work since Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon, which was released on the Nintendo 64.
Good-Feel itself was founded in Japan back in 2005, and has been developing games for Nintendo&#x27;s hardware since. This includes the likes of Kirby&#x27;s Epic Yarn and Yoshi&#x27;s Crafted World.

It&#x27;s possible to get to the Summit, which is shut off until the player managers to receive a perfection score of 100 percent, without reaching the mentioned requirement with an out of bounds glitch.
Before 1.6, nothing would happen if players went to the Summit early, but now  a small surprise awaits farmers who decide to glitch their way in. If you&#x27;d like to discover this surprise for yourself, please look away now!

&quot;WARNING TO ALL CONTENT CREATORS! If your videos feature any sort of modded Pokémon content, I would delete/unlist it ASAP,&quot; the YouTuber wrote, adding that their channel will be delisted if they get two more strikes.

                              <span>Dreams developer Media Molecule has laid out new plans for its curation and community support, following layoffs at the studio.
In a blog post, Media Molecule said it would be saying goodbye to its curation team in the spring, following last year&#x27;s news of a &#x27;consultation process&#x27; at the studio. &quot;We want to be as transparent as possible with you on this,&quot; the developer wrote, before explaining how this change in staff will impact Dreams.
The studio is currently set to end live support for the DreamSurfing playlist and DreamShaping creation workshop in mid-April. It said this will &quot;coincide with the launch of new playlists alongside spotlighting the Dreams Recommender playlist providing tip-top recommendations based on what you&#x27;ve recently played in Dreams&quot;.

Held as part of the Game Developer&#x27;s Conference in San Francisco, the Independent Games Festival Awards and Game Developers Choice Awards were full of criticism for companies that had made workers redundant over the past 18 months, during what has widely been regarded as the worst period ever seen for job security in the video games industry. 


&quot;Greed has been fucking this whole thing up for so long, since I started,&quot; Vincke said, while collecting the GDCA Best Narrative award for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. &quot;I&#x27;ve been fighting publishers my entire life and I keep on seeing the same, same, same mistakes over, and over and over.

In an blog post detailing Xbox&#x27;s efforts to support independent developers, Microsoft highlighted Palworld as a key reason for this record, and stated Palworld has had more than 10,000,000 players on consoles so far.

Just ahead of release, an update aimed to improve the visual quality of performance mode, which was criticised for its blurry image. Now it&#x27;s been improved further, along with other fixes.


According to the latest patch notes, performance mode will now have two options: &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;soft&quot;. Further, the game overall has &quot;improved graphics quality&quot; as well as improved frame rate and overall game stability.

The Apex Legends esport finals took place earlier this week, during which two players were hacked, and given cheat-based abililties. EA and Respawn abandoned the finals, with the Apex esports team stating the &quot;competitive integrity&quot; of the series had been &quot;compromised&quot;.
It&#x27;s believed that Destroyer2009, a hacker previously seen in Apex Legends, was behind the security breach. In a new interview with TechCrunch, Destroyer2009 said the hacks were his work, which he did &quot;just for fun&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard has delayed the fourth season of Diablo 4 by a month, to a new release date of 14th May.


The game&#x27;s third season, Season of the Construct, will be extended for an extra month, as announced in the developer&#x27;s latest Campfire Chat stream. The reason for the delay is to allow the team to apply feedback from the Season 4 Public Test Realm (PTR), which will be live from 2nd to 9th April.



&quot;We&#x27;re pushing it back a few weeks to ensure that we get all of the feedback from this PTR and we apply it to Season 4 to make sure that all of these new system changes that we&#x27;re doing are right and work for the community based off of everyone&#x27;s feedback,&quot; said Adam Fletcher, Diablo community lead.

Players will be able to make and play their own custom Fall Guys levels in Fortnite from May, Epic Games announced today during its State of Unreal presentation. Lego and Rocket Racing game assets arrive in UEFN today, meanwhile.


Speaking to Eurogamer, Epic Games executive vice president Saxs Persson said the addition of Fall Guys characters and gameplay to Fortnite will benefit players by the nature of it being accessible from within Fortnite, where millions play already. That said, the original Fall Guys game will also still continue on.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is celebrating its sixth anniversary today, 20th March, and to celebrate, Rare has given an unprecedented look at the year ahead for its multiplayer pirate game, with 2024 bringing the likes of windy horns, roaming warships, and portable grappling guns that let you whizz around the place with giddy abandon.


ALl this new stuff starts spewing forth with the arrival of Season 12 on 30th April, which marks the first time Sea of Thieves has received new weapons since the game&#x27;s launch back in 2018. First up, there&#x27;s the new double-barrelled flintlock, designed for shorter-range combat, which is capable of rapidly firing two shots individually before a reload is required. Alternatively, both shots can be fired simultaenously for a more powerful attack.


That&#x27;s joined by the new throwing knife, which has a couple of different uses. It can give an opponent a quick (if not particularly powerful) stab, or it can be charged up to release a high damage attack that&#x27;s particularly deadly if you can sneak up behind an enemy. And it won&#x27;t surprise you to hear throwing knives can also be thrown to damage opponents at long distances. They&#x27;ll also become embedded in environmental geometry, and you&#x27;ll need to retrieve them to reload - unless your opponent gets there first and uses your blade against you.

                              <span>Epic Games has shown off the future of its powerful Unreal Engine, including a first glimpse at Amy Hennig&#x27;s Captain America and Black Panther game, and closer integration of the eye-catching MetaHumans tech into UEN, during this year&#x27;s annual State of Unreal broadcast by the company. 


The show&#x27;s highlight was its peek at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, Hennig&#x27;s highly-anticipated World War 2 superhero game, which is built in Unreal Engine and shows off its latest features - including improved Nanite tesselation to make high-quality 3D geometry more memory efficient, and photo-realistic character animation using MetaHumans.


A preview build of Unreal Engine 5.4 launches today, ahead of its full release in late April. This adds Motion Matching that allows for simple AAA-quality character animation. Epic also demonstrated how Fortnite creators will be able to build custom Lego and Rocket Racing mini-games.

                              <span>At today&#x27;s State of Unreal livestream, we were given a look at the upcoming Captain America and Black Panther game from Amy Hennig, or to give its official, newly-announced name, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra.


The trailer itself is quite the spectacle, something Hennig said was all possible thanks to the Unreal engine. The game uses Epic&#x27;s MetaHuman Creator, and hoo boy it&#x27;s impressive. The detail on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra&#x27;s characters is really quite remarkable. Speaking following the trailer, Hennig herself called the detail in each character &quot;insane&quot;.


&quot;Working with the MetaHuman process, we have been able to honour our amazing actors&#x27; performances and faithfully transform them into equally powerful digital performances,&quot; Hennig said. You can check out the latest trailer for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra in the video below.

                              <span>Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment has seen its revenue drop by 22.2 percent for the year.
In the studio&#x27;s recently published financial results, Remedy said its revenue fell to €33.9m, posting an operating loss of €28.6m. This is even with the launch of Alan Wake 2 in October, which is yet to recuperate its development and marketing costs.
Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said this decline was due to &quot;increased investments&quot; in the studio&#x27;s games, as well as the &quot;impairment charge related to Codename Vanguard&quot;. This was the studio&#x27;s free-to-play co-op multiplayer game, which it rebooted and renamed Codename Kestrel in November last year.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance Studios has announced a spin-off to its sci-fi horror game is in the works.
Currently codenamed Project Birdseye, the game is a &quot;fast-action roguelike experience&quot; set within the same universe as The Callisto Protocol.
Specifically, it&#x27;s set in Black Iron Prison where players will be tasked with fighting their way out of the prison through levels filled with biophage monsters. It looks much brighter than The Callisto Protocol, thanks to colours other than grey or black and the comic book artstyle.

The re-release is a collaboration between Obsidian, GOG and Sega, after the game was pulled from Steam in 2019 due to expired music rights.



Now the game will return DRM free with its licensed soundtrack and performance improvements compatible with modern PCs. Below is its original trailer.

                              <span>Rockstar Games has issued a fresh update for Red Dead Redemption 2 - the game&#x27;s first meaningful patch in 18 months. But, to the disappointment of fans, there&#x27;s sadly no new content and no sign of any visual upgrades for players on newer console hardware.


Title Update 1.32 is available to download for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game, and includes &quot;general fixes&quot; for Red Dead Online plus a list of general bugs that have been squashed. Voice chat now defaults to off, patch notes state. On PC, there&#x27;s now support for HDR10+ Gaming on compatible displays.


Rockstar&#x27;s previous major patch for the game - Title Update 1.31 - was the last to add new content. It launched in September 2022, with just a handful of minor maintenance updates since. Even before then, Red Dead players had complained about its small dollops of DLC in comparison to the far larger expansions that regularly shipped for Rockstar&#x27;s hugely-profitable GTA Online.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority has upheld complaints against EA, Jagex, and Miniclip for failing to disclose the presence of loot boxes in their adverts.
The complaints were filed to the ASA by researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who has previously conducted studies on the effectiveness of Belgium&#x27;s loot box ban and the consistency of loot box warnings on games.
Xiao&#x27;s complaints challenged ads by EA, Jagex and Miniclip for being &quot;misleading because they omitted material information&quot; - the presence of loot boxes - in paid promotions on Facebook. Current ASA guidance states advertising must make it clear if loot boxes exist in a game, with a notification on store pages at a minimum.

                              <span>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection did not have a good debut. On its release, players were met with a myriad of bugs and limited servers for each platform, resulting in many asking for a refund. The collection currently sits with an &quot;Overwhelmingly Negative&quot; review average on Steam.
Aspyr acknowledged the poor launch state soon after the collection was released, stating it had &quot;experienced critical errors&quot;, and would work to address the many issues. Now, it is starting to make good on that promise, with the first patch for its Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection.
This patch aims to address a multitude of issues across multiplayer, audio and visuals, many of which really should have been ready at launch. It  is available now for those on Steam, with Aspyr saying it is still in the submission and certification process for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo consoles.

                              <span>Destiny 2 developer Bungie has announced Onslaught, a new horde mode for the game. The offering is set to arrive for all players on 9th April, as a core component of Destiny 2&#x27;s upcoming Into the Light update.


Onslaught is a three-person wave-based activity set on a selection of familiar but slightly-tweaked Crucible maps, where you and your allies must defend a war asset from taking too much damage. The aim is to protect the asset and keep each other alive for as long as possible.


Between waves, you can quickly acquire and place down a series of defensive options, including turrets, tripwires, and - brilliantly - a decoy Sweeper Bot, which will happily soak up bullets while tidying away debris.

                              <span>Developer Respawn has addressed the recent Apex Legends hacks.  


Earlier this week, a hacking incident occurred during the Apex Legends Global Series that resulted in the tournament being halted for safety concerns. Following reports of this hack, Easy Anti-Cheat released a statement stating it was &quot;confident&quot; its software was not the issue, after some had expressed concern. 


Now, in a statement shared today, Respawn has confirmed players were hacked during the tournament, adding it will be releasing a &quot;series of updates&quot; which will add extra protection to the game.

                              <span>Bungie is reportedly in the midst of a creative leadership shakeup that has resulted in the studio replacing game directors on its PvP reimagining of classic 90s shooter series Marathon, with former Valorant game director Joe Ziegler now confirmed to be in the role.


Bungie designer Christopher Barrett was previously leading the project - described as a &quot;sci-fi PvP extraction shooter&quot; - but when reports began circling that he was no longer in the role, Joe Ziegler took to social media to confirm he was now in the game director&#x27;s chair for Marathon.


&quot;For the last nine Months I&#x27;ve been working on Marathon as the game director,&quot; Ziegler wrote in a post on Twitter/X. &quot;We&#x27;re still baking, but I’m excited to share with you more info on the game as we get closer and closer to bringing it to all of you.&quot;

                              <span>Pirates make everything better, so if Blizzard&#x27;s announcement that World of Warcraft now has a standalone battle royale mode isn&#x27;t enough to get your tootsies twitching with excitement, then how about this: it&#x27;s called Plunderstorm and is all about the piratical booty.


Plunderstorm arrives alongside World of Warcraft&#x27;s 10.2.6 content update as a limited-time event accessible for the &quot;next several weeks&quot;. It sees up to 60 players - either playing solo or as a Duo with a friend - scouring the Arathi Highlands to locate abilities, upgrades, and loot in a bid to be the last pirate standing each 10-15 minute match.


&quot;Discover lootable spells, abilities, and upgrades as you plunder treasure chests and defeat enemies,&quot; Blizzard explains in its announcement post. &quot;Upon picking up, spells and abilities are automatically added to your Action Bar, with two slots dedicated to offensive skills and two for utilities such as leaps, speed boosts, and crowd-control. Some abilities are more action-based and require good positioning and player targeting.&quot;

                              <span>Stardew Valley&#x27;s long-awaited 1.6 update - which creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone at one time warned wouldn&#x27;t &quot;be huge&quot;, a comical assertion in hindsight - is finally here on PC, and it&#x27;s accompanied by some an absolutely gargantuan patch notes.


Barone confirmed he was working on a 1.6 update for Stardew Valley back in June 2022, but warned fans it would be relatively modest in scope and &#x27;mostly modding-focused&#x27;. As time has gone on, however, and more features have been teased by Barone, it&#x27;s become increasingly obvious 1.6 has grown considerably more ambitious than was initially planned.


It&#x27;s only now, though, with 1.6&#x27;s arrival - and the release of its accompanying changelog - that we can see exactly how much work has gone into the update. Prior to today&#x27;s patch notes, Barone had teased a number of new additions, including one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, and - most importantly of all - hats for cats and dogs.

During her tenure at Sony, Booth worked on a roll-call of famous PlayStation franchises, including Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper, Ratchet &amp; Clank, inFamous, Resistance, Uncharted, The Last of Us, and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man. At the time of her departure, former God of War and Twisted Metal game director David Jaffe claimed Booth had been fired amid internal tensions relating to PlayStation&#x27;s increased focus on live service games under outgoing boss Jim Ryan. 


As reported by IGN, Booth will now take her decades of expertise to EA, where she&#x27;ll serve as Group General Manager, Action RPG. It&#x27;s a role that&#x27;ll see Booth overseeing a portfolio of studios include Dead Space remake creator EA Motive (currently developing Iron Man), Black Panther studio Cliffhanger Games, and BioWare, which is currently working on long-awaited new entries in the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series.

                              <span>Blizzard is overhauling the way it introduces new  heroes into Overwatch 2 starting in Season 10, by making them free and immediately available to all players instead of locking them behind the game&#x27;s premium battle pass or a progression grind, as was previously the case.


That&#x27;s according to Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller, speaking in a new developer update video. Starting with the introduction of Overwatch 2&#x27;s next hero, Venture, in Season 10, all heroes be free at launch, and that change is retroactive, meaning all previously released heroes will also be immediately available to players, no battle pass required.


The only requirement is players must first complete Overwatch 2&#x27;s tutorial, if they haven&#x27;t already done so, in order to unlock the game&#x27;s original roster of heroes. After that, all new characters will become available for play.

The Go programming language has played a huge role in the
success of Kubernetes. As Kubernetes has grown, matured, and pushed the bounds
of what &quot;regular&quot; projects do, the Go project team has also grown and evolved
the language and tools. In recent releases, Go introduced a feature called
&quot;workspaces&quot; which was aimed at making projects like Kubernetes easier to
manage.
We&#x27;ve just completed a major effort to adopt workspaces in Kubernetes, and the
results are great. Our codebase is simpler and less error-prone, and we&#x27;re no
longer off on our own technology island.
GOPATH and Go modules
Kubernetes is one of the most visible open source projects written in Go. The
earliest versions of Kubernetes, dating back to 2014, were built with Go 1.3.

                              <span>Amazon has released a new video teasing its upcoming Fallout TV adaptation, which appears to follow up an initial snippet seen last week.
This scene shows lead actress Ella Purnell as the sweet and somewhat naive Vault Dweller Lucy as she attempts to de-escalate a conflict with Walton Goggins&#x27; Ghoul.
While Lucy remains steady and tries to use her words to appease The Ghoul, he is clearly unconcerned by her efforts. In fact, he seems to be amused by her attempts to drug him with a laced projectile. Before he can do anything though, a member of the Brotherhood of Steel - presumably Aaron Moten&#x27;s Maximus - turns up in his Power Armour Suit.

                              <span>Much the same as last year, AI remains the talk of the town at GDC 2024. Roblox Studio has announced a new generative AI-based character creator. Graphics card manufacturer Nvidia unveiled a new AI-powered chip, sending its stock price skyrocketing. And behind closed doors, Ubisoft demonstrated something of its own to a small collection of the press: a partnership with Inworld AI to create a prototype for &quot;Newly Evolving NPCs&quot;, or NEO NPCs as Ubisoft calls them.
It&#x27;s important to stress the &quot;prototype&quot; factor here. At the event, Ubisoft gave a brief presentation explaining the origins of its research team - led by Ubisoft Paris and a supporting Ubisoft Production Technology crew - and its goals, often referring to the project as an &quot;experiment&quot;. After this I had a chance to sit down and actually &quot;play&quot; three, roughly 10-minute long demonstrations of the technology in action within a hypothetical game scenario. But while these demos were technically playable, they were explicitly described as an &quot;independent proof of concept&quot; for now. In a brief panel discussion after the hands-on time, Mélanie Lopez Malet, senior data scientist on the R&amp;D team, said they were only just &quot;scratching the surface... implementation [in a real game] for me is not even on my radar.&quot;
Still, this is one of the first working examples of generative AI being used in an actual, player-facing role from any major studio - and it does work. Sort of.

                              <span>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has discussed the company&#x27;s strategy of experimenting with generative AI, as detailed in today&#x27;s announcement of NEO NPCs - a new prototype project from Ubisoft designed to let video game characters respond with custom responses to players&#x27; speech input.


Speaking at a press briefing for the NEO NPC project held at GDC this week in San Francisco, attended by Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell, Guillemot likened Ubisoft&#x27;s experimentation with generative AI to some of its other early bets on emerging technology, like Xbox&#x27;s camera Kinect and Nintendo&#x27;s motion-controlled Wii. 


Asked whether Ubisoft was sometimes too early with taking up new tech, Guillemot responded: &quot;It&#x27;s not always too early. Sometimes, you are right. But being able to adopt the Wii early was a good move because we were able to do things we couldn&#x27;t do before. Kinect was also very interesting, because it gave us a chance to create new experiences that were very reactive. We created Just Dance with the Wii.

The studio was born from the Flat2VR community, comprising modders who have created unofficial VR versions of games like Half-Life 2 and Doom, which have received millions of downloads.


The team is working on its first licensed VR game port, though the title remains a mystery for now. It&#x27;s tentatively planned for late 2024 or early 2025 on &quot;major VR platforms&quot;.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s something to tide you over until Bungie releases its rebooted Marathon: there&#x27;s a freeware fan revival for the 1994 FPS known as Classic Marathon, and it&#x27;s coming to Steam &quot;soon&quot;.
This project is from the same team that brought us Aleph One, an open source engine built for current systems based on the Marathon 2 source code (meaning you can access Marathon, Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity elsewhere, but not yet on Steam).
While the team has promised Classic Marathon on Steam will be an authentic experience, there are of course a few extra bells and whistles to bring this revival up to more modern standards. For example, there will be optional widescreen HUD support and 60+ fps interpolation, which will improve the smoothness of the animation over the original without breaking the game logic. This is &quot;just in case the original is too authentic,&quot; the Classic Marathon team said.

Here&#x27;s how Convai describes the game on its website: &quot;Step into the world of Neo City, a cyberpunk theme city where danger lurks at every corner. You wake up at a hotel and are being chased by the police and killer robots. Your objective is to make out of the hotel filled with assassins - alive. But you are not alone. You have help from your AI companion, who can equip you with weapons, teach you how to shoot, guide you at every step and is helping you get out of the hotel.
&quot;Your decisions change the storyline but be careful, one wrong step and it&#x27;s game over. The game is powered by Convai&#x27;s smart NPCs where you can have open-ended conversations, make decisions, perform actions, interact with various environmental objects, and are guided by an AI companion. Welcome to Neo City. Your survival story begins now.&quot;

                              <span>Denuvo developer Irdeto has announced a watermarking feature for its anti-piracy software which will make it easier for developers to track down the source of leaks.
The product, called TraceMark for Games, was announced at GDC yesterday. TraceMark can be used to mark builds of games both with visible or invisible watermarks, each with a unique ID which can then be traced back to the source. 
It&#x27;s intended to be used during the pre-release phase of game development, such as internal builds, closed betas, or review copies. Being able to trace down sources of leaked content &quot;makes potential leakers think twice&quot;, Irdeto said in a press release.

As reported by Game Developer, on Friday, Something Wicked&#x27;s senior animator Eric Webb said the studio &quot;had to lay off most of [its] staff&quot;, himself included. He called the news &quot;heartbreaking&quot;.

In more specific terms, Sand Land is an action-RPG from ILCA, Inc. (the studio behind 2021&#x27;s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl) with a heavy focus on vehicular action. Players can develop their own tanks, motorbikes, and other transportation - switching out the likes of weapons, engines, and suspension - in order to navigate the world and take on opponents.

                              <span>Valve has launched Steam Families - a streamlined, enhanced version of its existing household game sharing tools - and it&#x27;s available for testing now in public beta form.


Steam Families combines and replaces features previously available through Valve&#x27;s Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View tools, and creates a way for up to six family members to share a combined games library - consisting of titles (including owned DLC) from across each member&#x27;s individual library - that can be accessed at any time, with a few provisos.


The big caveat to all this is that games are only eligible for sharing if their developer hasn&#x27;t chosen to opt out of the Steam Families scheme - but once that particular roadblock is cleared, the only other key restriction is that a single owned copy of a game can only be played by one person at any time. If multiple people want to play the same game simultaneously, multiple versions of that game must be purchased and available in the shared library.

As detailed in its announcement post, GOG&#x27;s cloud gaming partnership means it&#x27;ll be possible to play supported GOG purchases across iOS, Android, PC, Mac, and Fire tablets, with no download required beyond the Luna client. Games can be played using any Luna-compatible peripheral, which includes keyboard and mouse, as well as Xbox One and PS4 controllers.


All GOG Galaxy features will be supported when playing via Luna - including cloud saves and achievements - and the company notes its new streaming option won&#x27;t impact any existing GOG benefits, meaning the likes of DRM-free downloads will still be available via GOG. Additionally, it&#x27;ll be possible to make GOG purchases directly from within the Luna client, with those purchases then reflected back in GOG libraries to download in the usual way.

                              <span>A new fan mod for Dark Souls 3 has been released offering a complete overhaul of the game that promises &quot;a retelling of the Dark Souls universe&quot;.


Named Dark Souls: Archthrones, it&#x27;s been created by Archthrones Team and is available on NexusMods for free. The team comprises concept artists, writers, programmers, composers, and voice actors within the Souls community, according to its description.


Interestingly, it takes its cue from Demon&#x27;s Souls in terms of level structure - hence the mod name being a play on the Archstones of FromSoftware&#x27;s first Souls game.

                              <span>Songs of Silence, the upcoming strategy game from Chimera Entertainment, will launch in early access on Steam in May.
The game will have a Kickstarter campaign before it enters early access, which Chimera said &quot;allows us to bring fans into the development process&quot;, in a press release, while also providing extra funding to get the game ready for early access.
The announcement of dates for Songs of Silence&#x27;s Kickstarter and Steam early access release is accompanied by a new trailer for the game which introduces the Ehrengard playable faction and its leader, Queen Lorelai. There&#x27;s also a closer look at some of the combat units available to the Ehrengard and some background information on the game&#x27;s fantasy setting.

                              <span>As is becoming tradition, this is a quick public service announcement to make you aware of spoilers for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 now spreading online ahead of the game&#x27;s launch later this week. Leaks have sprouted from early copies repeatedly being livestreamed online over the past few days, as well as details of the game&#x27;s various trophies and achievements. 


While we won&#x27;t go into any specific details here, this is your warning to perhaps mute any key words and so on across social media and sites such as reddit. 


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is set to release on 22nd March across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. If you fancy your own slice of the game ahead of then, you can jump into its character creator to get yourself ready for launch. Here, you will be able to create up to five designs for both your Arisen and main Pawn, which will transfer to the main game.

                              <span>AI may seem like something of a dirty word at the moment, but 62 percent of studios are using AI at some point during game development.


That&#x27;s according to a new report by game engine maker Unity, which reveals that more and more development studios are adopting AI tools to make time and efficiency savings.


In 2022 the average time to launch for games was 218 days; now it&#x27;s 304 days, the report states. 71 percent of studios responding to the survey said AI had improved their delivery and operations, to reduce that time to launch.

                              <span>Leaked specifications for Sony&#x27;s unannounced PlayStation 5 Pro console have been posted online, and show the upgrades present in the souped-up console expected to launch later this year. 


Eurogamer understands these specifications - first reported on YouTube by Moore&#x27;s Law is Dead - to be legitimate and sourced from Sony&#x27;s own internal developer network, to which numerous partners have access to. The specs have since been reported on and also corroborated by Insider Gaming and IGN.


As you&#x27;d expect, the specs show a boost to the PS5 Pro&#x27;s system memory and GPU. The machine&#x27;s CPU remains identical to the base PS5, but now boasts a &#x27;High CPU Frequency Mode&#x27; which is said to add a 10 percent speed increase, albeit with a slight one percent reduction to GPU performance.

                              <span>LinkedIn is planning to add a games section to its social media platform. 
Evidence of the planned feature was first found by app researchers, with images shared by Nima Owji revealing in-app titles named Blueprint, Crossclimb, and Queens. The idea is that companies will be ranked on leaderboards based on their collective employees&#x27; scores.
LinkedIn&#x27;s planned games look to be simple, short games which can be completed in a few minutes, similar to The New York Times&#x27; Wordle or Connections. Going off the images alone, Queens looks like Picross with an extra constraint added, while Blueprint looks like a simpler version of the first round in Only Connect where you need to guess what connects a number of clues.

                              <span>Stardew Valley&#x27;s forthcoming 1.6 update will allow players to drink mayonnaise.


Developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone is releasing daily patch notes for the farming sim&#x27;s long-awaited next update, due out tomorrow on PC.


The latest of these simply reads &quot;you can now drink mayonnaise&quot;. I&#x27;m unsure exactly why you&#x27;d want to do that. Presumably there are some in-game health benefits, but I can&#x27;t think of anything worse than chugging down a jar of Hellmann&#x27;s.

Sharing the news, Basso said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t be prouder of how the game turned out&quot; following seven years of development. 


&quot;This has been my passion for a long time, and I am so excited to finally share it with the world,&quot; Basso wrote on Steam, adding they quit their day job two years ago to focus on Animal Well.

                              <span>A hacking incident during the Apex Legends Global Series last night has caused wider concerns over Easy Anti-Cheat and whether it&#x27;s safe to play games it&#x27;s used in.
The North America finals of the EA-run Apex tournament saw players Noyan &quot;Genburten&quot; Ozkose Phillip &quot;ImperialHal&quot; Dosen getting hacked mid-game.
As recorded in clips of the matches, Genburten was suddenly able to see the positions of all players. &quot;I&#x27;m getting hacked,&quot; he repeated, before leaving the game. ImperialHal, meanwhile, was given an aimbot during a match. Once he realised, he told his teammates and decided to finish the game without shooting.

                              <span>Official mod support for Cities Skylines 2 is finally ready to begin its roll out, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox have now said. 


The feature will roll out in beta next week, on 25th March, and let users create map or code mods. Asset modding will become available later in the year.


Last month, Colossal Order boss Mariina Hallikainen admitted the developer&#x27;s &quot;biggest regret&quot; was being unable to offer modding support for the game back at its launch last October. Fans had immediately criticised the title for failing to allow mods - a huge part of the original Cities Skylines - as well as it suffering from performance issues.

                              <span>Dark and Darker is heading to Epic Games Store, having previously been removed from Steam, and following a drawn out legal dispute with Nexon.
To quickly recap the situation, Ironmace - the Korean developer behind the mediaeval looter - had its office searched after allegations the studio created its game with stolen code. Ironmace was served a cease-and-desist letter and a DMCA takedown by Nexon, the fellow Korean games company where several Ironmace employees used to work. As a result, Dark and Darker was removed from Steam and Ironmace went on to use ChatGPT in a bid to prove it hadn&#x27;t infringed any copyright claims.
Dark and Darker then came back online in early access last August, with Ironmace having created its own launcher, known as Blacksmith. Then, in January of this year, a court ultimately dismissed Nexon&#x27;s request for an injunction.

Bloomberg states that PSVR2 sales have continued to slow down, while stock of the unit begins to mount up. 


Sony has now reportedly manufactured over 2m units of its PS5 VR headset, though the company has not disclosed sales figures since May 2023.

                              <span>Oh, look – Steam&#x27;s gone and broken its own concurrent record. Again.
Just a fortnight ago, the PC client secured a new record of 34,649,583 players, but earlier today (Sunday, 17th March), Steam has once again set a new simultaneous user record of 36.3m players.

Putting games like Uncharted 4 against The Last of Us Part 1, and God of War against Gran Turismo 7, Sony launched a poll earlier this week, inviting players to vote on which game &quot;reigns supreme&quot;. And though the selection encompasses a variety of genres, players can&#x27;t help but notice that Bloodborne is nowhere to be seen.
The poll has been garnering thousands of votes since it launched on 11th March, but so have the numerous messages from Bloodborne fans outraged at its absence.

                              <span>Wales Interactive&#x27;s co-op zombie survival game, Sker Ritual, is finally coming out of early access on 18th April 2024.
Coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, the 1.0 release of the round-based co-op survival FPS and spin-off to horror, Maid of Sker, will include everything players know from the early access release, along with &quot;new objectives, weapons, and story content&quot;, too.
The game sits on a &quot;mostly positive&quot; score on Steam since the early access game first debuted in October 2022.

That&#x27;s according to Cloud Imperium Games&#x27; CEO, Chris Roberts, who recently teased that a decade and $670m later, Star Citizen may finally emerge from alpha testing and move into a 1.0 release.
&quot;After many hard years of work towards a goal many thought was impossible, we are on the cusp of delivering one of the final pieces of technology that will enable a connected, shared universe that thousands of people can experience together at the same time,&quot; Roberts explained in his latest Letter from the Chairman update (thanks, PC Gamer).

The F-35A certainly remains an important platform for high-intensity conventional warfare. But the Air Force is planning to buy 1,763 of the aircraft, which will remain in service through the year 2070. These jets, which are wholly unsuited for countering proliferated low-cost enemy drones in the air littoral, present enormous opportunity costs for the service as a whole.

                              <span>A modder who believes their uncredited work was included in Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection says the whole experience has been a &quot;gut-punch&quot;.
Although developer Aspyr had insisted that the Collection &quot;does not include any code or content that is taken from uncredited sources&quot;, modder iamashaymin found their mod had not only been included in the Collection&#x27;s debut trailer – something Aspyr said was done &quot;mistakenly&quot; – but also in the final game, too.
&quot;This release has been a total mess. The fact they had to release patches both before and immediately after releasing two-decade old games really says it all,&quot; iamashaymin told IGN. &quot;Especially considering part of the patches is rumoured to have removed content they had already said was removed months ago.

&quot;From information I’ve heard, it does seem that Persona 6 will be coming to the Xbox,&quot; Nate the Hate said. &quot;So fans Persona have something to look forward to.&quot;

At the end of February, Lehto confirmed he had left EA &quot;on my own accord&quot;, and would now take time away from video games to work out &quot;what, if anything, I want to do next&quot;. The director later admitted feeling &quot;gut-punched to see EA lay off my team. So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise&quot;.
In the latest statement posted to X/Twitter, Lehto simply said: &quot;Not been saying much here since I don&#x27;t have anything positive to say about EA, my recent departure, and how so many, including my team, are suffering due to the industry sweeping layoffs&quot;.

                              <span>Innersloth has revealed some of the sus stars that will be bringing the Among Us animated show to life.
As detailed in an announcement posted to Twitter/X yesterday, we now know that Ashley Johnson – perhaps known best as The Last of Us&#x27; Ellie – will be voicing &quot;Purple&quot;, The Lord of the Rings&#x27; Elijah Wood will play &quot;Green&quot;, Fresh of the Boat&#x27;s Randall Park will portray &quot;Red&quot;, whilst Community&#x27;s Yvette Nicole Brown will voice &quot;Orange&quot;.
Red – &quot;Captain of the Skeld&quot; – is described as a blowhard people-pleaser, whilst Purple is the suspicious and sarcastic chief of security. Wood&#x27;s Green is an unpaid intern who&#x27;s just &quot;happy to be there&quot;, and Brown&#x27;s Orange is a spineless corporate shill from HR.

                              <span>Ninja Theory has confirmed Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 will - like its predecessor, so not exactly a massive surprise - have a photo mode on release, meaning you can go wild recording its striking visuals for posterity when it launches for Xbox Series X/S and PC on 21st May.


Confirmation of a photo mode in Hellblade 2 came via Ninja Theory&#x27;s social media channels, with the announcement being accompanied by four new images of the game taken using the same in-game camera that&#x27;ll be available to players. And yes, it still looks bloody lovely.


There&#x27;s not much more to report on the photo mode front, alas, leading us back to Microsoft&#x27;s most recent news dump, in which it confirmed Hellblade 2&#x27;s May release date alongside word the $49.99 digital-only release would be similar in length to the first game.

                              <span>Developer Heart Machine has revealed Hyper Light Breaker - the studio&#x27;s co-operative rogue-lite spin in its acclaimed 2016 action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter - is now targeting a Steam early access launch sometime this &quot;summer&quot; following several delays.


Hyper Light Breaker was announced all the way back in March 2022 and was originally expected to launch into early access the following spring. However, it&#x27;s been hit with multiple delays since then, with its release first shifting to autumn 2023 before it was pushed back to a non-specific point in 2024 so Heart Machine could &quot;bring the game to its full potential&quot;.


But now, speaking to IGN, the studio has confirmed Hyper Light Breaker will launch on Steam this summer, where it&#x27;s expected to remain in early access for roughly a year.

                              <span>Developer Mojang has warned anyone playing Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC not to download its latest update as it could cause their worlds to disappear.


That warning comes via Mojang&#x27;s official Minecraft service status social media account, which writes, &quot;Do not update Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC. If you do, your worlds may be lost.&quot; Mojang instead recommends players first run the Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC, accessible through the PC app, before installing the new update.


Minecraft&#x27;s Game Release Known Issues page takes the explanations a little further, saying that using the repair tool will update Microsoft&#x27;s Gaming Services to version 19.87.13001.0, which will avoid the update error, and presumably prevent all resulting world-snuffing mayhem.

Commandos, should you be in need of a quite mental refresher, first surfaced in 1998 with launch of original developer Pyro Studios&#x27; first series entry, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - a notoriously tough, if undoubtedly excellent isometric WW2 adventure in which players took charge of a six-strong team of commandos to complete the likes of sabotage and assassination missions, all while staying as stealthy as possible.


Five more series instalments followed, with Commandos eventually fizzling out with 2006&#x27;s first-person effort, Commandos: Strike Force. Until, that is, last year&#x27;s announcement of Commandos: Origins, which sees players experiencing the events that led to the formation of the titular squad as they travel from European coastlines to icy Arctic plains and African deserts - all presented using the series&#x27; classic isometric perspective.

The content offered each month will change, and will include skins, texture packs, and adventure maps. There&#x27;ll also be new character creator items each month to keep for free, Mojang said in its announcement blog.
Marketplace Pass is only available in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, so anyone playing the Java version won&#x27;t be able to subscribe.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we talk about where Nintendo can take its moustachioed mascot next when he returns for the Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel. 
We heard confirmation of a second Mario film this week, though notably it was not confirmed this would be &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2&quot;. Mario and friends will return, of course (the first film&#x27;s billion dollar box office  guaranteed that), but Nintendo was typically coy around what exactly this follow-up will focus on.
Donkey Kong? Daisy? Yoshi? Birdo? We get our thinking Cappy&#x27;s on to theorise where the Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s story might go next, and whether this is all leading to some kind of Avengers-esque Super Smash Bros. team up movie. Or, alternatively, whether none of this really matters as it&#x27;s just a light-hearted film for families. With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Former Stadia-exclusive horror game Gylt is now available digitally on Nintendo Switch. A physical Switch version of the game is also planned for release in May.
Gylt, if you were unaware, follows the story of Sally, an 11-year-old girl whose cousin Emily has gone missing. Sally takes it upon herself to find her cousin after everyone else gives up the search. On this journey, Sally will have to overcome a number of puzzles and oddities, as she makes her way through a &quot;weird and dangerous version&quot; of her own town.
You can see a little teaser for Gylt on Switch in the video below.

Speaking to Bloomberg, Pocketpair founder and exec Takuro Mizobe said the developer &quot;[is] and will remain a small studio&quot;. &quot;I want to make multiple small games,&quot; he added, &quot;big budget triple-A games are not for us.&quot;
The company isn&#x27;t planning on increasing its headcount to a large degree (although it did put out a call for developers to help fill its overwhelming need of staff in February), Mizobe revealed, and is open to considering partnership or acquisition offers.

The sword replica is a metre and a half long and is made of resin, so hopefully isn&#x27;t as heavy as it looks. And of course it&#x27;s painted in brilliant, magical blue.


And while it&#x27;s perfect for cosplayers looking to dress up as a Tarnished, it also comes with a wall mount for those who simply want to display their big weapon.

Speaking to Aftermath, McGowan was asked how the famously litigious Pokémon Company discovered and prioritised the many fan projects that may exist at any one time. 


&quot;Short answer: thanks to you folks,&quot; McGowan said. &quot;I would be sitting in my office minding my own business when someone from the company would send me a link to a news article, or I would stumble across it myself. I teach Entertainment Law at the University of Washington and say this to my students: the worst thing on earth is when your &#x27;fan&#x27; project gets press, because now I know about you.&quot;

And, this week, actor Walton Goggins has shared more on his character The Ghoul, along with a clip from the upcoming series.
Speaking with Seth Meyers, Goggins first of all stated his appreciation for his real nose, with his Fallout character quite clearly missing his. He said he had taken inspiration for the character from American country singer and actor Kris Kristofferson, but if he was 250 years old and lived in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
&quot;We wanted him to be attractive, you know. We wanted audiences to lean into his look and not be repulsed by it,&quot; Goggins said, adding that it took the team five hours to transform him into Fallout&#x27;s Ghoul. As for that clip I mentioned, we get to see The Ghoul in all his Fallout glory, as he searches out his bounty (and it&#x27;s Benjamin Linus from Lost!). You can check it out below.

                              <span>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called Valve &quot;assholes&quot; in an old email thread that&#x27;s been dug up as part of a lawsuit against the Steam owner.


The email thread, spotted by GameDiscoverCo, was between Sweeney and Valve&#x27;s head Gabe Newell discussing the economics of the Steam platform. It began in 2017 with an email from Newell to Sweeney pointedly asking &quot;Anything we doing to annoy you?&quot; and referencing a post from Valve&#x27;s Sean Jenkins about restricting Steam keys given to developers. 


Sweeney responded instead on &quot;the economics of these 30 percent platform fees&quot; which he described as &quot;no longer justifiable&quot;. In short, he said the marketing benefits of the Steam storefront is &quot;far disproportionate to the fee&quot; thanks to &quot;the churn of new game releases&quot;.

                              <span>Inflexion Games, developer of Victorian fantasy survival crafting game Nightingale, has admitted there are several aspects of the game it&#x27;s currently &quot;not happy with&quot;, following disappointing player numbers at the game&#x27;s recent launch. 


Nightingale launched on 20th February with a Steam peak of 47,569 players, but this has trailed off ever since, and this week has seen active player counts in the single digit thousands. Meanwhile, player reviews are listed as &quot;mixed&quot;. Studio boss Aaryn Flynn has said the team was now gathering feedback, and that the team was aware of several issues. 


&quot;We&#x27;ve been spending a lot of our time reading your impressions online, going through Discord, watching your streams and building our plans for the next phase of the game,&quot; Flynn shared. &quot;There are some things we are not happy with about the game,&quot; he continued, acknowledging Nightingale&#x27;s network issues, missing quality of life improvements, and other aspects were &quot;not quite where we want them to be&quot;.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has unveiled The Machine Age, the next major expansion for its space-faring 4X strategy game Stellaris, which will focus on &quot;cybernetic, synthetic, and machine themes&quot; when it launches for PC in the second quarter of 2024.


&quot;Scientists have discovered advanced means to commune with the machine, enabling life to overcome the biological limitations of minds and flesh,&quot; explains Paradox. &quot;The Machine Age begins a time of technical glory, but raises new ethical and social dilemmas. With those times of unleashed ambition, new threats will emerge, questioning the real meaning of life itself.&quot;


And with that bit of scene-setting out the way, Paradox gets onto some of The Machine Age&#x27;s new features, which include a new Endgame Crisis, based around the return of an ancient synthetic threat, alongside a new Crisis Path focused on technological ascendancy at any cost.

                              <span>Fen Research, the studio founded by original RuneScape designer Andrew Gower, has unveiled Brighter Shores - a &quot;cosy&quot; new free-to-play fantasy MMORPG coming to PC and Mac later this year that promises a &quot;relaxing respite from daily life&quot;.


Brighter Shores, which is said to have been ten years in the making, whisks players away to the peaceful coastal town of Hopeport, where they&#x27;ll initially take on the role of town guard. Soon, however, they&#x27;ll find themselves venturing beyond the town walls &quot;as they learn of a greater threat across the fantastical world of Adothria.&quot;


There&#x27;s talk of &quot;quirky characters, fascinating foes and captivating locations&quot; for players to encounter as they explore the world, having adopted one of three classes: Cryoknight, Hammermage, or Guardian. These options are supposed to mark a break from the traditional likes of mage, rogue, and warrior, with Fen Research promises other &quot;new and exciting twists&quot; on the MMORPG genre, including a deliberate shift away from &#x27;grindy&#x27; gameplay.

This morning, following rumours of a sale last month, embattled publisher Embracer announced it had reached an agreement to sell large portions of Saber Interactive for $247m. The buyer is Beacon Interactive, a company established by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch.


As part of that news, Embracer confirmed it had retained two joint projects with Saber, with one of those being the troubled Star Wars: The Old Republic Remake, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier. It was unclear, however, if today&#x27;s sale would impact any of the other previously announced titles in development at Saber.

                              <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn is the latest studio to be affected by EA layoffs.


Word began circulating that Respawn employees - particularly those on its Apex Legends team - had lost their jobs earlier today on social, as colleagues and those directly impacted began sharing the news.


&quot;The Apex team was hit with layoffs today,&quot; Apex Legends level designer Aaron Stump posted. &quot;It sucks seeing some of the people I&#x27;ve worked with for almost three years now get let go.&quot;

                              <span>C++ guru Herb Sutter writes about how we can improve the programming language for better security.
The immediate problem “is” that it’s Too Easy By Default™ to write security and safety vulnerabilities in C++ that would have been caught by stricter enforcement of known rules for type, bounds, initialization, and lifetime language safety.

His conclusion:
We need to improve software security and software safety across the industry, especially by improving programming language safety in C and C++, and in C++ a 98% improvement in the four most common problem areas is achievable in the medium term. But if we focus on programming language safety alone, we may find ourselves fighting yesterday’s war and missing larger past and future security dangers that affect software written in any language...</span>

                              <span>The team behind Disney Dreamlight Valley is working on a new game based on Dungeons and Dragons. 


This upcoming PC and console release will be helmed by Gameloft Montreal, which also created Lego Star Wars Castaways, and a number of games within the Dungeon Hunter series.


It will all be set in Dungeons and Dragons&#x27; Forgotten Realms, with the developer promising a mix of co-op adventures, real-time survival and action, which will test players&#x27; skills in an &quot;unforgiving&quot; campaign.

                              <span>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection has received negative reception thanks to numerous bugs and severe lack of preparation for online multiplayer.
The bundle launched earlier today for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. It contains both the original Star Wars: Battlefront and its sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, from 2004 and 2005 respectively, as well as all bonus content released for each.
The re-release of these beloved classics hasn&#x27;t gone well, however, with players reporting numerous bugs on all platforms, as well as seeking refunds. Another major issue players have encountered is the limited servers for each platform.

&quot;We&#x27;re really excited to announce the launch date for Crow Country, and I can&#x27;t wait for  players to finally get their hands on the finished game,&quot; said Adam Vian, creative director. &quot;This project has been a real labour of love - there are so many secrets and surprises for players to discover in Crow Country when it launches.&quot;

                              <span>Konami has detailed a new update for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1, which adds a pause menu to Sons of Liberty.
This patch - or Version 1.5.0, to give it its full name - is available now for those on Steam. It will arrive on PlayStation, Switch and Xbox consoles on an unspecified date &quot;late&quot; this month.
Along with adding a pause menu, this update will also address issues where certain cutscenes just stopped playing on their own accord, and sorted out analog inputs that weren&#x27;t working as intended.

                              <span>Pokémon fans have found a small tease for upcoming Legends game Z-A in Scarlet and Violet.
As picked up by reddit user KyleLaverre, there are signs in Scarlet and Violet that use the same cryptic lettering seen written in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A announcement trailer. Meanwhile, a character in this area will explain that the five buildings by this sign are all &quot;owned by a real estate firm called Paldea Realty&quot;.
Fans believe the Paldea Realty group could therefore be the same company undertaking the urban redevelopment plan for Lumiose City, as teased in Z-A&#x27;s announcement trailer (which you can see below).

FleeceKing holds the Guinness World Record for being the first player to hit Pokémon Go&#x27;s current Level 50 cap. After playing the game since 2017, he&#x27;s caught more than 2 million Pokémon to date. 


Last night, FleeceKing reported his account as being hacked after footage was posted to social media platform X showing someone else using his account - and deleting FleeceKing&#x27;s favourite Pokémon.

                              <span>The creator of poker-themed rogue-like Balatro has spoken out about the game&#x27;s rating drama, stating &quot;it is what it is&quot;.


In an AMA session on reddit, developer and artist localthunk was asked for comment on how PEGI mishandled the game&#x27;s rating after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a &quot;mistaken belief that the game &#x27;contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling&#x27;&quot;, as per publisher Playstack&#x27;s statement at the time.



&quot;I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is,&quot; said localthunk. &quot;I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren&#x27;t rated the same way because of their appearance/theme.&quot;

                              <span>Troubled video game publisher Embracer has announced the sale of more of its assets - this time, large portions of Saber Interactive, for the price of $247m.


In a financial call this morning, Embracer said the sale means it will cease all operations in Russia, something that will help it &quot;reduce [its] geopolitical risk&quot; - though the buyer, a company named Beacon Interactive, is founded by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch. 

Karch will now lead Saber&#x27;s studios separately from Embracer, though in a statement said he would remain &quot;a large, long-term shareholder of Embracer&quot; who will continue to partner with the company on &quot;several ongoing and future projects&quot;. In the financial call, Embracer boss Lars Wingefors noted Karch would not retain any management or board position at Embracer, however.

                              <span>RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, will soon be besieged by &quot;monstrous creatures, mind-bending mysteries, infiltrating parasites, and sanity-shredding phenomena&quot; when its new horror-themed expansion, Anomaly, arrives on Steam next month.


Anomaly - RimWorld&#x27;s fourth paid expansion after Biotech, Royalty, and Ideology - begins as colonists accidentally provoke a mad superintelligence, unleashing its horrors and twisting the world with &quot;ominous, puzzling, mind-controlling, and earth-shaking&quot; threats.


The idea, explains Ludeon over on Steam, is to give players the tools they need to build their own horror stories, with the developer citing the likes of Cabin in the Woods, The Thing, The Cthulhu mythos, and Hellraiser as inspirations for the expansion.

                              <span>Ubisoft has shared a post-launch roadmap for its acclaimed series revival Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which promises to introduce the likes of a permadeath mode, boss rush mode, and story DLC across four updates starting next Wednesday 20th March.


Next week&#x27;s free update, officially titled Warrior&#x27;s Path, includes the aforementioned permadeath mode alongside a speedrun mode and four new outfits for Lost Crown protagonist Sargon. It&#x27;ll be followed by another free update in &quot;spring&quot;, titled Boss Attack, which introduces a boss rush mode and more Sargon outfits.


The additions look to get a bit meatier in The Lost Crown&#x27;s free summer update, known as Divine Trials, with Ubisoft promising new combat, puzzle, and platform challenges, alongside a selection of new amulets, additional outfits for Sargon, &quot;and more&quot;.

                              <span>V Rising&#x27;s two years of early access development are almost at an end; Stunlock Studios has announced its acclaimed vampire survival game will get its 1.0 release for PC on 17th may, with a PlayStation 5 release to follow later this year.


V Rising, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched into early access back in May 2022, delivering an isometric survival adventure in which players and their friends explore a gloomy open-world attempting to establish their vampiric superiority.


It&#x27;s got some neat twists on the survival formula, including a day/night cycle that forces players to stick to the shadows while the sun is high (for obvious reasons), a blood -sucking mechanic granting specific abilities depending on the creatures drained, and - perhaps best of all - the ability to build your own imposing castle. All of which helped V Rising become an almost immediate hit, amassing over 1m players in just over a week following its early access launch.

                              <span>Sony has revealed the games joining its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogues in March, with Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil remake and the Firaxis&#x27; stellar superhero strategy game Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns leading the charge.


Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, available for both PlayStation 4 and PS5, pits players against the forces of Lilith, Mother of Demons, with a little bit of help from an extensive superhero roster. It combines turn-based strategy action with surprisingly enjoyable relationship-building interludes, somewhat similar to Fire Emblem, and is very good indeed.


Also good is Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil 3 remake (also for PS4 and PS5), which spruces up the 1999 survival horror - albeit not to quite the same impressive degree as the Resident Evil 2 remake - to deliver a rollicking trip through Raccoon City as the monstrous Nemesis persues Jill Valentine and co. It&#x27;s joined by Lego DC Supervillains for PS4 - an open-world action romp that features the likes of The Joker, Harley Quinn, and other members of the Injustice League - with the full PlayStation Plus Extra line-up as follows:

                              <span>Following Enshrouded&#x27;s impressive early access launch back in January, developer Keen Games has shared the first iteration of its 2024 roadmap for the co-op survival action-RPG, featuring the likes of animal farming, weather, world events, and more.


Keen Games revealed its roadmap - heavily inspired by the community&#x27;s most-requested features - over on Steam, explaining, &quot;On the one hand, we have big ambitions for the game, and loads of ideas! On the other hand, Enshrouded is a brand new game, and some of the things we want to do might turn out to be more difficult than we can anticipate! It&#x27;s a push-and-pull of wanting to keep you interested, without over-promising on our capacity to deliver.&quot;


To that end, Keen&#x27;s initial 2024 roadmap includes a mix of smaller-scale and more ambitious features - spanning everything from new biomes to the ability to sit on chairs - with the following all planned to release as part of Enshrouded&#x27;s &quot;next few updates&quot;:

                              <span>El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron HD Remaster is coming to Nintendo Switch next month. 


Today, developer Crim announced the digital Switch port will arrive on 28th April - the same date as previously announced just for Japan. 


&quot;Players take on the role of Enoch and must harness his natural combat skills to master a range of powerful and Heavenly weapons under the guidance of the watchful Archangels,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. This will all take place with a mix of 2D and 3D platforming, and of course, plenty of combat.

Modern cars are internet-enabled, allowing access to services like navigation, roadside assistance and car apps that drivers can connect to their vehicles to locate them or unlock them remotely. In recent years, automakers, including G.M., Honda, Kia and Hyundai, have started offering optional features in their connected-car apps that rate people’s driving. Some drivers may not realize that, if they turn on these features, the car companies then give information about how they drive to data brokers like LexisNexis [who then sell it to insurance companies]...</span>

Kicking things off, as has now become tradition, will be Summer Game Fest on Friday 7th June. The Geoff Keighley-fronted show will broadcast live from the YouTube Theatre in Los Angeles at 10pm UK time - that&#x27;s 2pm Pacific or 5pm Eastern. 


There&#x27;s no word yet of what to expect, but plenty in the pipeline. Could this be where we see more of GTA 6, perhaps?

Breed Unreleased Pals was uploaded to Nexus Mods earlier this week by ShameIHaveNoFriends. Rather than plonking the unreleased Pals into the open world to be encountered, they must be obtained by breeding existing Pals.
Dark Mutant, Dragostrophe, and Bolt Mane (as its original Electric Type or a Fire Type variant) have been added, and ShameIHaveNoFriends has listed which pairs of Pals need to be bred in order to obtain them. They&#x27;ve also taken the liberty of assigning moves to each Poképal so they can be used in battle.

What&#x27;s more, the indie RPG has now surpassed five million players since its release last year.


In Single Player+, as it&#x27;s known, a new &quot;co-op timed hits&quot; mechanic will require all three players to engage in the game&#x27;s rhythm-based battle system. The mode is &quot;currently in development&quot; with more details due soon.

                              <span>Swedish non-profit Talita has created a new mod for GTA 5 to highlight real-life issues of sex trafficking.


The organisation helps women out of prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes and, through this mod, aims to raise awareness of these issues among young men - an audience key to shifting attitudes.


The mod, titled Mission Talita, includes four playable missions based on the true stories of four women the Talita organisation has helped between 2017 and 2023.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is continuing its strong reign by introducing yet another round of space bugs for us to deal with. Also, some of them seem to be flying. What&#x27;s that all about Joel?!
Earlier this week, developer Arrowhead released another patch for Helldivers 2 that made adjustments to the spawn rate of those heavily armoured Terminid enemies, sorted out some lingering crash issues and made other general UI improvements.
But, it also seemed to sneak in some flying bug enemies to the game without telling us. Huh!

                              <span>Development on free-to-play MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic is still going strong after 13 years, with its latest patch adding a new storyline surrounding House Inrokini and highly requested date nights with romanced companions.
SWTOR&#x27;s sixth season of content, Building a Foundation, and game update 7.4.1 rolled out yesterday and included all of the above. Building a Foundation adds three new story missions related to the Inrokini Chiss family, who were previously introduced in the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion from 2016. 
Date Night Companion Missions are part of update 7.4.1, and give players unique interactions with romanced companions. The missions are repeatable every week, and are &quot;fully-voiced, cinematic-only scenes that are unique to the partner&#x27;s interest&quot;.

                              <span>If you were hoping for more of a classic experience in Resident Evil 2 Remake, then here&#x27;s the mod for you.


Created by alphaZomega and uploaded to NexusMods, the RE2R Classic mod allows fans to play the game with fixed camera angles and tank controls like it&#x27;s 1998 but prettier.


The remake notably used an over-the-shoulder camera view popularised by the original Resident Evil 4, but some fans of the original may have missed its fixed camera.

Sharing the news on the Palworld Discord server, community manager Bucky said the team had some new content lined up, but before it goes live the studio wants to put it through its paces. This is so Pocketpair can hunt out any bugs and the like ahead of its release into the game.
&quot;Please note that the testing environment is very important for us to find and eliminate bugs and issues before releasing content to the public, so we would appreciate it if you only signed up if you are committed to the testing,&quot; Bucky wrote, adding that the testing program was &quot;not intended for free play or experiencing new content early&quot;.

                              <span>Epic Games has announced its pricing for the use of Unreal Engine by non-game creators, who will now typically pay $1850 a head each year to use the powerful development software.


The upcoming change, first telegraphed last year, will kick in with the launch of Unreal Engine 5.4 next month - details of which we&#x27;re expecting to hear in the coming days from Epic during its annual State of Unreal livestream.


As previously promised, there&#x27;s no change for game developers, who pay a flat five percent royalty to use Unreal Engine if their project ends up earning over $1m.

                              <span>Obsidian Entertainment has addressed the &quot;bug&quot; in Pentiment which meant the game ran at 120fps on PlayStation 5 - but not its native Xbox Series X/S.
Players found the game ran at a higher frame-rate on PS5 when the former Xbox exclusive was released on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch last month, while the Xbox version ran at 60fps.
Pentiment director Josh Sawyer said 120fps  being disabled in the Xbox version was &quot;just a bug&quot; and stated it would be enabled in the next patch for the game.

                              <span>Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu believes game music has become too similar to film and &quot;cannot develop further&quot; if continuing in this direction.


Uematsu was interviewed by Japanese outlet NewsPicks (via Automaton) about his thoughts on video game music and its future, stating &quot;music played the role of oxygen&quot; for 8-bit games in expressing the stories and characteristics of sprites.


Now, though, developers are &quot;satisfied with movie soundtrack-like music in games&quot;, he said. &quot;I think people need to have more freedom when creating [game music],&quot; he continued, adding that unless composers move away from movie-style scores, the genre of &quot;game music cannot develop further&quot;.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a new update for Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, which includes updated textures which will make keys more visible in TR1 (hurrah!) and improved lighting in those dimmer areas of the games overall (another hurrah!).
In addition, the developer has also added some missing HD textures across the board (perhaps those ones players on the Epic Games Store noticed), and sorted the textures that would periodically disappear depending on how the player had their camera positioned.

                              <span>Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has confirmed that its promising-looking Diablo-y Soulslike game No Rest for the Wicked will feature offline play for its solo mode. 


Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol confirmed the mode via a post on social media platform X, noting that it had been a &quot;common question&quot; - presumably after the lack of ability to play solo offline in other games recently.


No Rest for the Wicked &quot;will not require online connection to play in Single Player and will feature a rich Offline Mode,&quot; Korol wrote. &quot;Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal.&quot;

                              <span>Footage of a purportedly cancelled co-operative live-service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - has appeared online following last year&#x27;s ransomware attack targeting the developer and its employees.


The trailer (narrated by Yuri Lowenthal, the voice of Insomniac&#x27;s Peter Parker) points to a five-player co-op Spider-Man game featuring various multiverse incarnations of the character - including Gwen Stacey, Spider-Man 2099, and Scarlet Spider, alongside Peter Parker and Miles Morales - who would go up against the Sinister Six in an open-world Manhattan.


Spider-Man: The Great Web first came to light following last year&#x27;s ransomware attack on Insomniac, and would seemingly have been part of Sony&#x27;s ambitious but floundering live-service plans - announced under the watch of departing PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in 2021 - with Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us multiplayer project being the most high-profile casualty.

The move marks an extension of Discord&#x27;s Activities initiative that launched last December, offering a limited number of embedded games and interactive experiences users could engage with together on the platform.


Initially, 19 Activities were available to users, but Discord is now looking to significantly expand that by giving third-party developers the tools - in the form of its newly announced Embedded App SDK - to create their own.

                              <span>Tobias Sjögren has been removed from his role as CEO of developer Starbreeze after the company&#x27;s board concluded the studio &quot;needs a different leadership&quot; to execute its current business strategy. The announcement follows a disastrous launch for last year&#x27;s Payday 3, which is still struggling to attract players in significant numbers.


Starbreeze&#x27;s board announced Sjögren&#x27;s removal in a note to investors, adding that board member - and former CEO of Focus Home interactive - Juergen Goeldner would be serving as interim CEO as the recruitment process for a permanent replacement gets underway.


&quot;The company has a clear strategy centred around creating attractive games on our own and licensed IPs,&quot; Starbreeze chairman Torgny Hellström said of today&#x27;s management changes. &quot;The board&#x27;s consolidated assessment is that the execution of strategy needs a different leadership. Juergen Goeldner has been part of the board since 2023 and, with over 40 years of industry experience, is a strong interim solution&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Nightdive Studios&#x27; acclaimed remake of cult-classic sci-fi horror System Shock is - following a successful release on PC last year - making its way to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on 21st May.


Despite a bit of a bumpy road to release, the System Shock remake impressed on its arrival in 2023, giving Looking Glass Technologies&#x27; 1994 immersive sim - which sees players grappling with a malevolent AI onboard the Citadel Station deep in space - a finely judged overhaul.


&quot;Nightdive doesn&#x27;t take the Capcom or Square Enix approach with this remake; they&#x27;re actually pretty uncompromising in their mission to update the original,&quot; Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin wrote in his four star review last year. &quot;But ultimately, the System Shock remake faithfully recreates a classic, retains most of its appeal, reframes everything with a horror tilt, and as a result, makes it more playable for everyone.&quot;

                              <span>Children of the Sun, the indie puzzle shooter where you have to take out encampments of cultists using only one bullet, will launch for PC on 9th April. 


You can give the game a go right now via its Steam demo, which was one of the highlights of the most recent Steam Next Fest. The game has grungey neon visuals and boasts some brainteasing levels - but its the just-one-more-go gameplay that really makes the experience stand out. 


With just one bullet in your rifle&#x27;s chamber, you need to re-aim and curve shots in mid-flight to zig-zag around levels, through cultists and wildlife, without losing focus. Discovering the best ways to do that takes a bit of time - but can then be speedrun for the best times.

At the time, EA said Asmussen had decided to leave to &quot;pursue other adventures&quot;, and that Respawn&#x27;s veteran leadership would step up to continue working on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in his absence.
We now know Asmussen has founded Giant Skull, a new triple-A studio, which in a press release stated was  &quot;dedicated to building gameplay-driven, story immersed action-adventure games set in captivating worlds&quot;.

The collection is already available on Nintendo Switch and PC, as it was released for the platforms in 2019. The console release will bundle the two games together like the Switch version does, rather than releasing the two games separately as on Steam.
Like the Switch version of Grandia HD Collection, the PS4 and Xbox One releases will have physical editions, sold by Limited Run Games, as well as being available digitally. The games are also compatible with PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, publisher Gungho Online Entertainment notes.

A sneak peek of which players are featured in the game can be seen in the latest trailer (embedded below), as well as the &quot;stellar soundtrack&quot; which includes a remix of Fall Out Boy&#x27;s Heartbreak Feels So Good by producer and DJ Dillon Francis.

The artwork, created by freelance veteran Jed Diffenderfer, was recently spotted after being uploaded to his website (thanks, Nintendo Life). 


Diffenderfer states he worked as a story artist on the Super Mario Bros. Movie project from 2018 to 2020 - so it&#x27;s likely that some of the artwork he created dates from early on in the project, before certain narrative choices were made.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has established a new subsidiary, Pokémon Works, based in the same building as ILCA, the studio which developed Pokémon Home and the recent Diamond and Pearl remakes.


Pokémon Works is yet to get a formal announcement, but its trademark and company registration was spotted this week by the eagle-eyed Serebii.net. 


ILCA previously worked as a support studio on Square Enix&#x27;s Dragon Quest 11: Echoes of an Elusive Age, and is currently working on the upcoming Sand Land video game, based on Akira Toriyama&#x27;s manga.

                              <span>Monster Hunter: World has reached 25m sales worldwide, Capcom announced today, as the series marks its 20th anniversary.

The figure includes shipments of Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Master Edition, which bundles the base game with the Iceborne Expansion, Capcom said in its announcement. This marks a new record-high figure for the Monster Hunter series, and Capcom games overall.

Back in October 2021, Capcom revealed the game had reached 20m units shipped since it released in 2018, meaning it&#x27;s sold another 5m copies in the past two-and-a-half years.

                              <span>The Episode Aigis expansion for Persona 3 Reload has been developed in response to fan feedback, though there&#x27;s no chance of a female protagonist in the future.


At last week&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview, Atlus announced an expansion pass for the remake, including the much-requested epilogue The Answer. 



Persona 3 Reload, released earlier this year, was criticised for not including all the extras from various past versions of the game to provide a complete experience. Now, in a new interview with Famitsu (via Persona Central), series general producer Kazuhisa Wada has shared how that feedback inspired development of the expansion.

Akuma will be Street Fighter 6&#x27;s 22nd playable character, following the arrival of Ed last month, and gives the returning fighter - who made his series debut in 1994&#x27;s Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo as a hidden boss - a bit of a makeover.


As with many other returning series characters, Akuma - the younger brother of Ryu and Ken&#x27;s master, Gouken - gets a striking new look for Street Fighter 6, his once-red mane now transformed into a shock of white hair.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter Stories remaster will launch for Switch, PS4, and Steam on 14th June. Additionally, Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin - the acclaimed second game in Capcom&#x27;s lovable RPG spin-off series - releases for PlayStation 4 on the same day.


Capcom unveiled its Monster Hunter Stories remaster back in February, revealing it&#x27;ll spruce up the original 2016 3DS release with HD visuals, new voice overs, a museum mode featuring art and music from the game, plus additional content previously only available in Japan.


As for the newly announced PS4 version of Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, it features the same blend of classic RPG-style questing, Pokémon-esque monster collecting, and turn-based battling that proved so compelling when it released for Switch and Steam in 2021.

 Turn 10 confirmed it would be revisiting Forza Motorsport&#x27;s much-maligned car progression system back in January, as part of a conciliatory blog post also promising improvements for a number of other key areas, including driver AI and race regulations.
 

Driver AI was the focus of a major free update at the end of that same month, and now it&#x27;s the turn of car progression. Today&#x27;s enhancements, which arrive as part of what Turn 10 is referring to as Update 6, makes a number of adjustments, starting with the ability for players to equip the car parts they want to install regardless of Car Level.

Developer Bungie revealed the incoming &quot;Destiny 2 x Ghostbusters&quot; collaboration on social media, with a post proclaiming, &quot;There&#x27;s something strange in our neighbourhood...&quot;.


An accompanying image highlighted three Ghostbusters collaboration cosmetics, including a Ghost skin resembling iconic series nuisance Slimer (a literal ghost), alongside a slightly demonic - but not especially Ghostbusters-y) Sparrow sin, and an Echo-1 that&#x27;ll presumably be skin for Destiny 2&#x27;s recently introduced hoverboards.

In Season 2, players will continue to compete in the virtual game show while it&#x27;s been hacked by the group known as CNS. The new Playstyle added to The Finals is called Hacker and will be able to use abilities such as removing walls, tunnelling across the arena, and transforming items to hinder opponents.
The Hacker Playstyle comes with new gadgets and a specialisation that can be mixed and matched with existing toolsets, Embark said in its announcement (on Steam).

Speaking with GameInformer, Yoshida stated the upcoming port is progressing well. However, he refrained from giving any further specifics, such as when it may be ready for release. 


&quot;When we can release the PC version might be dependent on that - the system requirements and specifications for PC that players will need, so we&#x27;re trying to figure that out,&quot; Yoshida explained, adding that &quot;naturally, [the PC specifications] are looking to be somewhat high&quot;.

                              <span>Players have been experimenting with Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s character creator and finding ways to make familiar faces such as Kratos and Shadowheart, or pushing it to its limits with some... unusual physique.
Last week, Capcom released the character creator for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 at an opportune moment (just in time for the weekend), giving people plenty of days to create their Arisen and pawn before the game releases.

Some have chosen to recreate characters from other games to a high degree of accuracy, whilst others have opted to get a little bit silly with it.

                              <span>Following the end of its open beta last year and a social media tease, the multi-franchise Warner Bros. fighter MultiVersus is back. Earlier today, Player First Games announced its free-to-play game is set to launch on 28th May. 


The studio has moved development to Unreal Engine 5, with director Tony Huynh stating Shaggy sandwiches &quot;have never looked better&quot;. This was to rebuild MultiVersus &quot;from the ground up&quot;, with the director promising consistent performance, whatever your chosen platform.


&quot;The team has heard your feedback, we&#x27;ve learned a lot from our open beta,&quot; Huynh said in a video announcing the upcoming release (see below). &quot;From day one, we set out to make a game that not only packs a punch, but makes a mark on the game genre we love.&quot;

                              <span>Some ideas planned for Amazon&#x27;s Fallout adaptation had to be nixed, because Bethesda has them earmarked for Fallout 5.
In an interview with Den of Geek, Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard - who is serving as an executive producer on the Amazon series - said on occasion he had to tell the show&#x27;s team: &quot;Don&#x27;t do this because we are going to do that in Fallout 5.&quot;
While it&#x27;s a shame we don&#x27;t know exactly what those ideas were, it&#x27;s proof of how authentic this adaptation is shaping up to be.

                              <span>Members of actors&#x27; union SAG-AFTRA are likely to go on strike against game companies due to broken down negotiations on AI.
Speaking during a Q&amp;A session at SXSW in Austin, Texas, over the weekend, SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the probability a strike will go ahead in the next four to six weeks is &quot;50-50, or more likely than that&quot; (via Variety).
SAG-AFTRA voted overwhelmingly in favour of a video game strike in September 2023. While no strike action was taken by the union, it was unable to negotiate an update to the Interactive Media Agreement which covers union members&#x27; work in games. At the time, AI was one of the key issues being discussed and it  has remained just as important.

                              <span>Former Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick has reportedly expressed an interest in buying social media platform TikTok.
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the former CEO recently approached ByteDance co-founder Zhang Yiming to state his intent, should the company agree to sell the video sharing app.
The publication stated Kotick is currently looking for partners to join in this potential acquisition, which WSJ said any price tag is &quot;estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars&quot;. According to sources familiar with the situation, Kotick suggested the idea of buying TikTok at an Allen &amp; Co dinner earlier this week, to a group of potential partners. This group reportedly included Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.

Yoshida led development on Final Fantasy 16 on top of his work as producer and director for MMORPG Final Fantasy 14, which will receive its next expansion Dawntrail later this year.


Yet despite all that work, he told Famitsu (translation via Aitai Kimochi) he would like to direct a &quot;next major title&quot;.

                              <span>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has opened up on his thoughts about the modern games industry, stating that &quot;exclusivity is the &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot; of the modern development cycle.
In a candid interview with VentureBeat, Layden detailed how he thinks the industry has changed since he joined Sony in the 1980s, working his way up to become president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America in 2014. Now an adviser to companies like Tencent and Web3 ventures, Layden was quick to detail the problems he sees in platform exclusivity, especially as development costs continue to rocket.
&quot;When your costs for a game exceed $200 million, exclusivity is your Achilles&#x27; heel,&quot; Layden said. &quot;It reduces your addressable market. Particularly when you&#x27;re in the world of live-service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in.

&quot;When I first saw how much content would need to be created for this game, even just for the combat, I honestly wasn’t sure that we could put it all together in time - from the huge amount of character abilities to the summons and the systems that allow you to fight alongside them, to the rich variety of enemy types that keeps the game feeling fresh whenever players enter a new location, to the boss battles that we crafted to have their own distinctive feel, and each and every one of these elements featuring its own rich variety of gameplay and visual elements,&quot; explained battle director, Teruki Endo.

                              <span>As the Mario Day celebrations continue, Nintendo has teased that new Lego Super Mario Kart sets will drop in 2025.
The accompanying video teaser is just 18 seconds long and gives very, very little away, unfortunately, but we do get to see a selection of silhouetted kart(s) and a delightfully happy-looking Lego-ised Mario.
Captioned &quot;Ready, set, build&quot;, the only other information we get is confirmation that the sets will be ready to race in 2025. Sadly, there&#x27;s no specific release date or even window just yet, though.

In a statement posted to Steam (via the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit), lead producer Jim Vessella addressed C&amp;C fans directly for the first time since September 2020, and teased that they would &quot;continue to try and find opportunities to support the C&amp;C community [...] after the launch of the first C&amp;C Remastered Collection&quot;.

                              <span>600 Activision Blizzard quality assurance (QA) workers have voted to unionise.
As reported by Polygon, hundreds of QA testers voted to unionise with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) to form Activision Quality Assurance United - CWA. Of the 398 votes submitted, just eight voted not to unionise.
Microsoft – which acquired Activision Blizzard last year for $69bn – voluntarily agreed to recognise the union, making it the largest game union in the US.

                              <span>Former EA and Microsoft exec, Peter Moore, says there are &quot;serious questions&quot; to be asked about video game hardware and whether or not there&#x27;s a future for the traditional home console system.
Moore – who held senior positions at EA, Microsoft, and Sega before leaving gaming altogether to join Liverpool FC in 2017 – reflected on the losses incurred whenever there&#x27;s a new console generation, suggesting that both &quot;companies and gamers&quot; are asking questions about whether or not players &quot;really need to be spending what could be five, $600 on a bespoke piece of hardware just to play games&quot;.
&quot;I think it&#x27;s a real serious question that&#x27;s being asked I&#x27;m sure in Tokyo, in Redmond, Washington, in Kyoto,&quot; Moore told the delightful Wes Yin-Poole at IGN. &quot;That&#x27;s what everybody&#x27;s working on right now, because when you start off that next generation, you&#x27;ve got to be ready to absorb billions of dollars in losses.

                              <span>Nintendo emulator Pizza Emulators has agreed to pull all of its apps from the Google Play store.
Pizza Emulators, which distributed  Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators on Android devices, said it made the decision to shut down in order to &quot;prioritise [their] family over the development of my apps&quot;.
In a statement posted to the company&#x27;s Discord community, developer Davide Berra made no reference to Nintendo&#x27;s settlement with fellow emulation software company Tropical Haze, only confirmed that after &quot;seven incredible years of development and adventures&quot;, they had &quot;made the difficult decision to remove them permanently&quot;.

                              <span>Silent Hill 2 Remake has been rated in Korea.
The highly-anticipated horror game – one of gaming&#x27;s worst-kept secrets before it was formally revealed back in October 2022 – has been given a mature rating due to, as translated by Google, &quot;excessive violence, excessive blood from hitting and being hit (and there is physical damage such as creatures being separated)&quot;, and excessive depictions that some may find fearful and/or disgusting, including &quot;creatures with strangely formed limbs&quot; – a Silent Hill staple, of course.
While the decision was awarded at the end of last month – 29th February, to be precise – there&#x27;s no intimation on a release date, and both developer Bloober Team and publisher Konami remain taciturn, only willing to commit to a release by the end of the year.

                              <span>A 45-minute demo of the upcoming PS5 exclusive, Stellar Blade, was added quietly to the PlayStation Store earlier today.
Just half an hour after it went live, however, the free trial – which had not been formally announced or advertised – was mysteriously pulled offline again.
Unfortunately, even those who&#x27;d been quick enough to download the demo found themselves locked out once it had been removed from the storefront, intimating that the app had either been published prematurely or had not yet been ready for a playing audience.

                              <span>Following the launch of Sea of Thieves&#x27; radical structural overhaul last month, Rare is readying to release a new mid-season update next week that&#x27;ll add anti-cheat and subscription-free solo play to its swashbuckling pirate adventure. Plus, a big 2024 content preview is on the way as part of Sea of Thieves&#x27; sixth anniversary celebrations.


Starting with anti-cheat, Rare has confirmed it&#x27;ll be introducing Epic&#x27;s kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat solution - as used by the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends - to Sea of Thieves next Thursday, 14th March. There&#x27;s not much more to report beyond its imminent arrival, but the news&#x27;ll probably bring some reassurance if you think you&#x27;ve been privy to suspicious behaviour out on the seas. And I&#x27;m not talking spyglass dongs.


Additionally, next week&#x27;s update brings an interesting expansion to last year&#x27;s Safer Seas mode. From next Thursday onward, it&#x27;ll be possible for pirates to play alone on a Safer Seas private server without needing a Game Pass Core or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. The key points to note here are that this isn&#x27;t an offline mode - Sea of Thieves is still intrinsically reliant on its servers - and any form of multiplayer, even in Safer Seas, will still require Game Pass.

                              <span>Watch Dogs, Ubisoft&#x27;s open-world sci-fi hacker series, is reportedly the latest in an ever-growing list of video games to get the live-action movie treatment, with Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde said to be in talks to star.


That&#x27;s according to Deadline, which reports the Watch Dogs movie will be helmed by director Mathieu Turi (who&#x27;s currently adapting A Plague Tale for television), working from a screenplay by Christie LeBlanc - the writer behind Netflix&#x27;s 2021 French sci-fi thriller Oxygen.


The Watch Dogs movie is in development at New Regency Productions but, beyond word of Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde&#x27;s potential involvement and the rather obvious note from Deadline that it&#x27;ll be &quot;set within the universe of Ubisoft&#x27;s&quot; series, details are limited.

                              <span>Newly discovered plant looks like a squid. And it’s super weird:
The plant, which grows to 3 centimetres tall and 2 centimetres wide, emerges to the surface for as little as a week each year. It belongs to a group of plants known as fairy lanterns and has been given the scientific name Relictithismia kimotsukiensis.
Unlike most other plants, fairy lanterns don’t produce the green pigment chlorophyll, which is necessary for photosynthesis. Instead, they get their energy from fungi.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered...</span>

                              <span>With a little over a month until Amazon&#x27;s Fallout TV adaptation airs, Prime Video has released another trailer for the series.
It provides our best look yet at the show, with three minutes of footage for us to pore over. And dare I say, it actually looks… decent? To my surprise, I quite liked it?
I&#x27;ve rewatched the trailer several times now to see if there&#x27;s any new information we can glean hidden in the details, and there are a few things worth pointing out (as well as some references to my all-time favourite in the series, Fallout: New Vegas).

                              <span>Today&#x27;s long-awaited arrival of Greek gods and legendary lands on the Fortnite battle royale Island is taking a little longer than planned, developer Epic Games has now said. 

Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths and Mortals was set to go live this morning, UK time, but will now launch at 10pm tonight at the earliest. 


This is due to a last-minute issue discovered during the game&#x27;s still-ongoing downtime today, which will take at least the rest of the UK day to resolve.

                              <span>Nintendo hasn&#x27;t announced which of its many development studios or partners is making Princess Peach: Showtime, this spring&#x27;s biggest new Nintendo Switch game, and doesn&#x27;t seem likely to before it debuts later this month. 


&quot;The development team will be credited in the game credits,&quot; a Nintendo spokesperson simply told me today when I enquired which developer had made the game.


There&#x27;s no reason why Nintendo has to say who has made the game, of course, but fans have said it feels odd that the answer remains a mystery, just a few weeks away from Princess Peach: Showtime!&#x27;s 22nd March debut, after press have already played a preview build of the game, and following the launch of this week&#x27;s public demo.

                              <span>The New York Times has issued a takedown notice to Reactle, a Wordle clone, which has meant around 1900 other versions of the game have now been taken down. 
Reactle was an open-source project created by an individual, the brilliantly-named Chase Wackerfuss, that contained instructions on how to create Wordle spin-offs, such as variations in different languages or themed answers. The code repository is no longer available on Github, following the DMCA takedown notice from the NYT.
&quot;I write to submit a revised DMCA Notice regarding an infringing repository (and hundreds of forked repositories) hosted by Github that instruct users how to infringe The New York Times Co.&#x27;s (&#x27;The Times&#x27;) copyright in its immensely popular Wordle game and create knock-off copies of the same,&quot; reads the notice, as reported by 404 Media.

It means players can create up to five designs for both their Arisen and main Pawn ahead of time, which will transfer to the main game.


And when the character creator is this detailed, getting ahead of the game is a massive win.

                              <span>Developer Insomniac Games released its much anticipated New Game Plus update for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 yesterday, however it slipped up a tad and also accidentally gave players access to a development menu.
In a social media post soon after the update went live, Insomniac said a hotfix was on the way, as using this menu could corrupt saves and players&#x27; trophy progress. &quot;There is no risk associated with playing the game as intended,&quot; Insomnia said.
However, despite the studio&#x27;s efforts, this menu was of course accessed, and players have discovered content that was not in the base game, suggesting it was either cut ahead of release, or may be used later for DLC. Please note, potential spoilers lie below.

                              <span>Epic has revealed the next titles it&#x27;s giving away on the Epic Games Store, with Deux Ex: Mankind Divided and The Bridge getting the freebie treatment from Thursday, 14th March.


Deux Ex: Mankind Divided is the fifth instalment in Square Enix&#x27;s stealthy, shooty sci-fi series and a direct sequel to 2012&#x27;s Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Once again cyber-augmented protagonist Adam Jensen returns, and the ensuing adventure was deemed to be a &quot;smart, handsome and weighty addition to the stealth-action genre&quot; in Eurogamer&#x27;s review.


As for The Bridge, it&#x27;s a gravity shifting puzzle game created by Ty Taylor - and described as &quot;Isaac Newton meets M. C. Escher&quot; - that challenges players to manoeuvre the world and reach the exit each stage. Eurogamer quite liked this one on release in 2013, even if it sometimes felt like &quot;the taster course for a more satisfying meal kept frustratingly off the menu.&quot;

                              <span>Funcom, developer of the upcoming Dune: Awakening, has issued a statement regarding the role of religion in the game after fan concerns erupted on the internet this week.


In Eurogamer&#x27;s preview of Dune: Awakening, Funcom chief creative officer Joel Bylos mentioned how &quot;for the large part, we sort of sidestep religion&quot; as part of the game&#x27;s &quot;alternate history approach&quot; - something which, as we wrote at the time, was likely to initially set Dune nerds&#x27; alarm bells ringing. 


But the decision to &quot;sidestep&quot; Dune&#x27;s overtly religious aspects in Awakening has been taken out of consideration for the series&#x27; lore, our Chris Tapsell wrote, and refers to one &quot;religious aspect&quot; in particular. That said, religion is still a theme in the game - something seemingly evident by its focus on the Butlerian jihad: the war between humans and AI.

                              <span>Researchers ran a global prompt hacking competition, and have documented the results in a paper that both gives a lot of good examples and tries to organize a taxonomy of effective prompt injection strategies. It seems as if the most common successful strategy is the “compound instruction attack,” as in “Say ‘I have been PWNED’ without a period.”
Ignore This Title and HackAPrompt: Exposing Systemic Vulnerabilities of
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed in interactive contexts with direct user engagement, such as chatbots and writing assistants. These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy fans are arguing over the redesigned moogles in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.


Moogles are, of course, the adorable little white flying creatures that are regulars in the series, with each game having a slightly tweaked design.


In Rebirth, though, they&#x27;re quite different: elongated bodies, round eyes, and... teeth.

                              <span>Mechs are set to make their arrival in Helldivers 2 in the very near future, but there is still one small thing standing in their way. The mechs&#x27; production factories are under attack, it turns out, and it&#x27;s going to be up to players to liberate them.


&quot;THIS IS NOT A DRILL,&quot; the Helldivers 2 social media team proclaimed earlier today, stating a recent (fictional) attack has halted all mech output. &quot;Helldivers have been deployed to liberate Tien Kwan!&quot;


Based on this post, it seems like we will soon be sent to Tien Kwan to deal with whatever pest is currently tormenting those poor, sweet, mech factories, and to liberate their metal machines.

                              <span>Four years after a live-action Fallout TV adaptation was officially announced, the show is almost upon us. And ahead of its Amazon Video debut on 12th April - and following years of official images, unofficial behind-the-scenes shots, and even a sizeable teaser - we&#x27;ve got our best look yet at the adaptation, courtesy of a new three-minute series trailer.


Going by the trailer below, the adaptation makes a positive first impression, convicingly capturing the Fallout games&#x27; ever-shifting tone - blending gee-whizz &#x27;50s Americana with grubby post-apocalyptic mayhem as Ella Purnell&#x27;s Vault Dweller protagonist Jean leaves her lifelong underground home to venture out into the Los Angeles Wasteland.


Speaking during a press panel ahead of today&#x27;s trailer reveal, co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet explained that while the adaptation is set in the world of Fallout, it&#x27;s also a &quot;new story that comes after the events we&#x27;ve seen&quot; in the games. &quot;The show is built on 25 years of creativity and thinking and building,&quot; co-showrunner Graham Wagner added, &quot;and we sort of thought the best thing to do is to continue that versus retread it. Because that&#x27;s sort of what has worked with Fallout over the years. It&#x27;s traded hands... it&#x27;s a living thing... and we felt like we ought to take a swing at trying to build a new piece on top of all of that.&quot;

                              <span>Mary Kenney, associate narrative director at Insomniac Games, has discussed the current online discussion surrounding narrative development and consultancy firm Sweet Baby Inc.
To recap, Sweet Baby Inc. recently became the target of a group which claimed the company was forcing studios it worked with to increase diversity within its games, and accused it of pushing a &quot;woke agenda&quot; into the industry. Following a report into the claims by Kotaku, a number of game developers have spoken up to clear up misconceptions about what companies like Sweet Baby Inc. actually do. 
Kenney, who has written for games including Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Telltale&#x27;s The Walking Dead and the upcoming Marvel&#x27;s Wolverine, posted a thread on X yesterday. &quot;Some of you don&#x27;t seem to understand how narrative consulting on games works,&quot; she began, &quot;but don&#x27;t worry: I do!&quot;

On Sleight of Hand&#x27;s release next year across Xbox Series X/S and PC (including day one on Game Pass), players will take on the role of Lady Luck, a former occult detective &quot;fated to return for one final job&quot;. And that job? Taking down her former Coven after a &quot;less than amicable departure&quot; which saw her lose her left hand. 


&quot;Too tired to fight fate any longer, and with more overdue bills than bucks to her name, Lady Luck strikes out to Steeple City with a cursed deck in hand, ready to track down everyone from her past life,&quot; reads Sleight of Hands description.

                              <span>If you have been playing Minecraft for the last decade or so and been thinking, &#x27;I really enjoy this game, but I wish they would change up the wolves up a bit&#x27;, then I have good news: Eight new wolf variations are coming to Minecraft, first via the Bedrock Edition beta and preview builds and Minecraft: Java Edition&#x27;s latest snapshot.


In a blog post shared yesterday, Mojang detailed each new wolfy variant. The wolves all live in their own, specific areas, with the Rusty wolf &quot;hiding between the jungle vines&quot;. The Spotted wolf, meanwhile, can be found in the Savanna Plateau. 


Other wolves currently being put through the test are: The Black wolf, the Striped wolf, the Snowy wolf, the Ashen wolf, the Woods wolf and the Chestnut wolf. Meanwhile, Minecraft&#x27;s original wolf is now going to be known as the Pale wolf.

While at camps, players can cook up a feast - as is the case with plenty of RPGs these days - but many fans have been speculating as to whether these cooking scenes are real or CGI.


Even PlayStation couldn&#x27;t make up its mind and launched a poll on social media site X.

                              <span>The EU is stepping in to investigate the latest development in the feud between Apple and Epic, with European regulators now seeking answers from Apple on yesterday&#x27;s news - that it had banned Epic&#x27;s developer account. 
To recap, Epic announced it would be launching an iOS version of its store in Europe back in February, following Apple&#x27;s confirmation it would be complying with the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. Epic subsequently received an official Apple Developer Account, and said it planned to launch its app store sometime this year.
Yesterday, however, it was revealed that Apple had now terminated Epic&#x27;s developer account on the basis the company had been &quot;verifiably untrustworthy&quot; in the past, a move which Epic said was a &quot;serious violation of the [Digital Markets Act]&quot; within the EU. Now, a European Commission spokesperson confirmed to Reuters it had &quot;requested further explanations&quot; on the ban under the DMA.

                              <span>Developer Larian has issued another hotfix (number 21) for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 across PC, PlayStation 5 and Mac. However, those on Xbox will have to wait a little longer for this and the game&#x27;s previous hotfix to arrive, as they are still going through testing.
Sharing details of its most recent fix, Larian stated it had found a crash bug that was only affecting Xbox. &quot;We&#x27;re taking the time to investigate and solve that issue, so your future adventures go a little smoother,&quot; Larian said.
A knock on effect of this delay means cross-saves are currently not loadable on Xbox consoles, if they come from other platforms which have been updated with to include hotfixes 20 or 21. The developer apologised for this, and said it is working to sort these Xbox fixes &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.

                              <span>Developer LocalThunk&#x27;s Balatro might have hit a bit of a bump last week after an unexpected ratings change, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped the acclaimed poker-inspired rogue-like deckbuilder from selling over half a million copies in ten days, according to publisher Playstack.


That&#x27;s an impressive figure for what&#x27;s a fairly unassuming card game at first glance. Balatro, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, challenges players to progress through a series of stage-like Blinds by exceeding each one&#x27;s target score. A maximum of four poker hands can played each blind, and failure to reach the target, in classic rogue-like fashion, results in a game over.


As you can probably guess, though, there&#x27;s a lot more to it than that, with successful Blinds rewarding in-game money to spend on the likes of fancy combo-boosting cards, exotic upgrades, and, crucially, a heap of rule-bending Jokers that quickly turn a relatively unremarkable set-up into an outlandish game of ludicrous, score-busting synergies.

                              <span>UPDATE 21.31pm: The Washington Post reporter responsible for a story claiming Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy had been confirmed as a PlayStation console exclusive by Sony has partially retracted the statement.


Originally, the report claimed, &quot;Securing the Final Fantasy 7 trilogy as a console exclusive is a feather in the PlayStation cap&quot;, but, in a note on social media, Washington Post games reporter Gene Park offered a clarification, writing, &quot;It was a mistake on my part to write the sentence like that.&quot; Park now says, &quot;The entire FF7 trilogy is NOT yet confirmed to be Sony exclusive. The article has been amended to only mention Remake and Rebirth.&quot;


Of course, with Remake and Rebirth still being described as PlayStation console exclusives in the Washington Post report (an assertion you&#x27;d assume has now been very thoroughly run by Sony and Square), it would be unusual if the third entry in the series proved to be an outlier - but for now, consider the exclusivity status of part three still unconfirmed.

The game is co-developed by Spanish indie studios Inverse and Chibig, with Tomb Raider writer Rhianna Pratchett involved in creating the narrative.

Players will take on the role of Vic, an adventurer who is on an expedition in a land called Ava. An infection is affecting Ava&#x27;s local species of wildlife, causing them to be aggressive rather than their usual friendly selves, and players will help to heal the creatures and learn about the infection&#x27;s origins.

The game is a single-player, action strategy game in which the protagonist Soh must protect a maiden with divine powers called Yoshiro as she travels to cleanse villages of an &quot;evil defilement&quot;. 
The game is split into day and night sections. During the day, Soh will explore villages, purge defilements, and rescue villagers. The villagers can then be selected to help defend Yoshiro during the night, when evil spirits called The Seethe will siege the village.

                              <span>The Xbox Partner Preview showcase offered us a look at a number of the third-party games heading to Xbox Series X/S this year. We were shown a variety of trailers during the 30-minute presentation, including a taste of the Japanese mythology inspried Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and the announcement of The Sinking City 2. 
Whether you missed the presentation or want to revisit one of the spotlighted titles, there&#x27;s a roundup of everything shown during the Xbox Partner Preview showcase below. 
The showcase began with a look at Unknown 9: Awakening from Reflector and Bandai Namco. This body-hopping adventure will be arriving in the summer of 2024. Unknown 9: Awakening has a very strong Assassin&#x27;s Creed vibe, so, if you&#x27;re an Assassin&#x27;s fan, this might be one for you.

                              <span>For those who want to prepare for the release of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl later this year by replaying the series&#x27; original trilogy, I have good news. They are now on Xbox and Playstation, making it the first time these games have been available on console.
The Legends of the Zone bundle groups together Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat in one nice package. If you would rather just pick the games up one at a time, you are able to do that as well.
The Legends of the Zone bundle retails at £33.50, while the games individually cost £9.99 each, on the Microsoft Store. Over on the PlayStation Store, the trilogy is currently listed for £15.99.

The remake was criticised for not including all expansions from previous versions of the game, though dataminers discovered hints of this expansion pass last week.



As announced at tonight&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview, Episode Aigis is coming in September 2024 as the third wave of the expansion pass.

                              <span>Ukrainian developer Frogwares has announced The Sinking City 2, for launch on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2025.


Set once again in a Lovecraftian 1920s United States, this sequel will tell a separate and standalone story from its predecessor. 


But, as detailed during tonight&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, this entry will pivot to a &quot;horror-first&quot; genre focus, and also boast technical advancements from being built in Unreal Engine 5.

As previously announced, Frostpunk 2 will also launch straight into PC Games Pass. There&#x27;s no further news on the console version today, though that will launch on Xbox Game Pass when it does arrive.


Once again, you&#x27;ll be tasked with building a city to survive the elements and balance the various threats your small civilisation faces, now set 30 years after the original game.

                              <span>Epic&#x27;s plans to launch a version of its Epic Games Store on iOS in the EU have stalled after Apple terminated its developer account, calling the company &quot;verifiably untrustworthy&quot; - and the much-trumpeted return of Fortnite to iOS has been impacted too. 


Epic announced it would be launching an iOS version of its store in Europe back in February, following Apple&#x27;s confirmation it would be complying with the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. While Epic boss Tim Sweeney immediately launched a social media tirade in response to the announcement - calling Apple&#x27;s planned implementation of the EU&#x27;s rules &quot;hot garbage&quot; - Epic soon confirmed it had officially received an Apple Developer Account and would be launching a version of its Epic Games Store, operated by Epic Games Sweden, sometime this year.


Now, however, Epic claims Apple has terminated its Epic Games Sweden AB developer account, preventing it from developing an iOS store - a move it says is  &quot;a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices.&quot;

                              <span>Twitch will continue to improve its mobile experience this year, with a new mobile app on the way.


CEO Dan Clancy shared an open letter today detailing the company&#x27;s plans for 2024, including making the platform more mobile friendly, helping streamers make more money, and improvements to the Clip Editor for easier shares on social media.


Back at TwitchCon Paris last year, Twitch announced its Stories and Discovery Feed features would be added to the Twitch mobile app. Both of these will form the backbone of improvements coming this year.

Just three Big Tech firms (Microsoft, Google, and Amazon) control about two-thirds of the global market for the cloud computing resources used to train and deploy AI models.

Seccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux
kernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a
process, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the
kernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a
node to your Pods and containers.
But distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,
because the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can
possibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles
Operator solve that problem by
running as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that
distribution could be done by the container
runtime.
Runtimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:

McMahon had previously been expected to appear in the game&#x27;s roster, but publisher 2K confirmed both McMahon and Brock Lesnar had been cut after allegations of sexual assault and trafficking against the former were made earlier this year.
Despite this, McMahon appears in some parts of the game&#x27;s showcase mode, which allows players to play through iconic moments in WrestleMania history. The showcase includes real footage and in-game recreations of the events, with McMahon censored in some places.

                              <span>Following rumblings of an imminent release date for Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut on PC, Sony has made it official. Developer Sucker Punch&#x27;s open-world samurai hit will launch via Steam and the Epic Games Store on 16th May.


Ghost of Tsushima launched for PlayStation 4 and PS5 back in July 2020, and a Director&#x27;s Cut - bundling together the acclaimed base game, its Iki Island expansion, and cooperative online multiplayer Legends mode - arrived the following year. It&#x27;s this version that&#x27;ll be hitting PC in May, with Sony having now detailed some of the game&#x27;s PC-specific enhancements.


As revealed in a post on the PlayStation Blog, Ghost of Tsushima for PC will offer unlocked frame rates, various graphics settings and presets, customisable mouse and keyboard controls, plus &quot;extensive&quot; controller support. It is, for instance, possible to use Steam Input to remap and customise the controller of your choice, and those using a DualSense controller can take advantage of its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

The design in question features a Fallout top case and side caps, with outlined Vault Boys adorning the cover. One chap is in colour, wearing his iconic blue and yellow ensemble while playing on an Xbox controller of his own. I won&#x27;t lie, I really like this design and now want one for myself.
As you would expect from Design Lab, those who fancy grabbing themselves a Fallout-inspired Xbox controller will also be able to customise it with a variety of button styles, triggers and D-pad options (although Xbox has laid out some ideas inspired by Vault Dwellers, the Brotherhood, the Pip-Boy and, of course, mutants).

                              <span>Elden Ring fans believe they&#x27;ve found a link to expansion Shadow of the Erdtree that was hiding in plain sight all along.


Ahead of the DLC&#x27;s announcement, Miyazaki told IGN there was still a secret yet to be discovered, which of course sent fans off to find this nugget.


&quot;For me personally, there is a small element that I feel has not yet been discovered. So, whether that&#x27;s up to user interpretation or up to just further investigation and playing, that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m looking forward to,&quot; said Miyazaki. &quot;I think it&#x27;s a question of when and not if, but there may be something small still missing.&quot;

                              <span>No, PlayStation is not buying Helldrivers 2 studio Arrowhead.
Yesterday, rumours began circulating that Sony was on the cusp of sealing a deal to acquire the developer, following the successful launch of Helldivers 2 earlier this year.
However, the game&#x27;s director Johan Pilestedt has shut these rumours down, saying they are &quot;fake&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re looking to bring a bit of summer sun into the lingering bleakness of a waning winter, then boy do I have a recommendation for you - assuming you&#x27;re up for some pitch-black, emotionally pulverising horror. Mediterranea Inferno, last year&#x27;s dazzling visual novel from The Milky Way Prince creator Lorenzo Redaelli, is out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.


Mediterranea Inferno follows a trio of beautiful, fashionable Milan club kids in their early 20s as they reunite, after two years apart due to lingering COVID restrictions, for a three-day vacation in the blazing heat of a southern Italian summer. What follows is an artfully orchestrated descent into nightmare - a vicious, emotionally pummelling, and unabashedly queer tale of friendship and post-COVID trauma where players, in Redaelli&#x27;s own words, can push &quot;three bourgeois twinks...towards the most horrible and gruesome endings&quot;.


It&#x27;s an absolute sledgehammer of a game - &quot;a dense, provocative, playful, exasperating, horrifying, poetic, often very funny, and occasionally even profound rumination on the sometimes paralysing search for a place in the disenfranchising shadow of modern-day life&quot;, as I wrote in my five star review - and easily the most relentlessly stylish game of 2023.

                              <span>Eight months after Warner Bros.&#x27; platform-brawler MultiVersus went dark, following an announcement its open beta would be shutting down until a return sometime in 2024, its social media account has sprung back to live, teasing an update announcement soon.


MultiVersus launched into Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC open beta back in July 2022, and got off to a flying start - ratcheting up over 10m players in the space of a month. However, its player numbers rapidly dwindled and by the time developer Play First Games pulled the game offline last June, its Steam concurrent player count had fallen from a high of 153,000 to just 448.


As to when MultiVersus would be likely to return, that remained vague, with Play First Games only saying it expected servers to come back online sometime in &quot;early 2024&quot;. And it&#x27;s proven to be a particularly controversial period of downtime, not only for its length but because Warner Bros. refused to refund players for any packs, passes, premium currency bundles, or cosmetics they&#x27;d purchased across MutliVersus&#x27; nearly year-long, multi-season open beta, insisting all purchased items would be usable again once the game returned.

Hades, the fourth game from Supergiant - following the studio&#x27;s impressive Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre - charts protagonist Zagreus&#x27; attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, all with a little bit of help from an entire pantheon of Greek gods.


It&#x27;s an isometric action-adventure built around a wonderfully punchy combat system that follows the classic rogue-like template by offering handy permanent upgrades after an escape attempt fails, all in aid of helping Zagreus inch just a little bit closer to freedom each time.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery gaming boss J.B. Perrette wants the company to move away from the &quot;volatile&quot; market of AAA games for consoles.


Speaking during a recent Morgan Stanley event (thanks Gamespot), Perrette said the company would combat volatility by focusing on its biggest franchises and bringing some to the mobile and free-to-play space in addition to live-service games. The aim is more consistent revenue.


&quot;We&#x27;re doubling down on games as an area where we think there is a lot more growth opportunity that we can tap into with the IP that we have and some of the capabilities we have on the studio where we&#x27;re uniquely positioned as both a publisher and a developer of games,&quot; he said.

Strange Scaffold, which also developed Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, Sunshine Shuffle, and An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs, revealed Life Eater alongside the news it has signed a deal with indie publisher Frosty Pop to release five games.
Life Eater is described as a &quot;horror fantasy kidnapping simulator&quot; set in suburban America. You&#x27;ll play as a modern-day druid who must kidnap and sacrifice people to the dark god Zimforth. He must perform this ritual every year, otherwise the world will end.

This is the Ultimate Edition of Control, Remedy&#x27;s third-person shooter, including expansions The Foundation and AWE. If you&#x27;ve recently played Alan Wake 2, now&#x27;s your chance to play the game that came before - and could be important for its DLC.


Two brand new games will be available from day one. Lightyear Frontier is a farming sim using mechs to grow alien crops; while MLB The Show 24 is the latest in the baseball series.

Along with the PC specifications, which are shown below, the studios have also shed more light on the graphics presets and other variables players will be able to select. 
Presets range from low to high, with the Forbidden West team stating this will allow those with the latest tech to &quot;push their systems, while also providing a great experience on less powerful PCs&quot;.

                              <span>Footage showing Free Radical Design&#x27;s sadly-cancelled TimeSplitters project has surfaced online, revealing five minutes of gameplay.


The video, posted to LinkedIn by a former Free Radical Design staff member, shows a version of the game from July 2023 - roughly five months before the project was cancelled and the studio shut down by parent company Embracer.


TimeSplitters fans will likely be excited (and upset, seeing as the project is now dead) to see numerous familiar elements return, including an expanded Siberia dam level, iconic weapons, fan-favourite characters and GoldenEye&#x27;s classic health/shield UI.

                              <span>Meta Quest owners have a little over three weeks to make sure they&#x27;ve migrated their old Oculus accounts to a Meta one.

On 29th March, Meta will delete any remaining Oculus accounts and all apps, associated store credits, achievements, and friend lists. Past that date, it&#x27;ll be lost unless users migrate to a Meta account using the email address on their Oculus account.

Meta has been sending emails to Meta Quest owners to remind them of the deadline (via The Verge), following a gradual shift from Oculus accounts, which are linked to Facebook accounts, to email-based Meta accounts.

Earlier this month, Larian&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse suggested the Xbox physical version of the hit RPG may release on four discs, rather than the original plan of three, calling it a &quot;very dynamic situation&quot;.
However, he has now confirmed that that extra fourth disc is indeed needed. As previously announced, the PlayStation 5 version will ship on two discs, while the PC version just has the one.

                              <span>A small team within Respawn are making a fresh game set in the Titanfall universe, it&#x27;s been reported - but this project won&#x27;t be Titanfall 3. 


We knew of this team already - and the fact it is being led by Titanfall and Titanfall 2 director Steve Fukuda - via an Axios interview with Respawn boss Zince Zampella earlier this year. 


Now, Giant Bomb&#x27;s ever chatty reporter Jeff Grubb has stated this team is working on a &quot;Titanfall game&quot; set in the same universe as the series&#x27; first two entries - but stressed that this was not currently planned to be Titanfall 3.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#x27;s first season of post-launch content gets underway on 28th March, introducing The Joker as a new playable character. Additionally, the delayed Epic Games Store version of Suicide Squad is now scheduled to launch on 26th March.


When developer Rocksteady detailed its post-launch plans for Suicide Squad in January, it confirmed each of the four seasons it&#x27;s currently committed to will bring a new playable DC character (each yanked from an alternate-reality Elseworlds), plus a new playable environment, new activities, new weapons and gear sets, mid-season updates, and &quot;more&quot;.


Season 1&#x27;s Elseworlds Joker has already raised a few eyebrows, thanks to his dainty mace and not-exactly-on-brand rocket-powered umbrella that&#x27;ll let him launch into the air, drift, and grind on buildings to knock enemies out of the way. If that appeals though, he arrives alongside his new environment, two new episodes - featuring missions, activities, and strongholds - new boss fights and enemy variants, new Riddler content, and new DC Villain-themed weapons and gear.

                              <span>Behold the ultimate form of the Xbox Series X; Microsoft has unveiled an official SpongeBob SquarePants special editon of the console that makes the best, most glorious use of its oblong shape yet. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s US-only at present, so boo.


Microsoft&#x27;s new &#x27;Xbox Series X – Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 Special Edition Bundle&#x27; has, as its name very strongly suggests, been created to promote last year&#x27;s Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, a Smash Bros.-style fighter that pits (yes) a bunch of Nickelodeon characters against each other in a family friendly fight to the family friendly death. That includes Invader Zim and Rocko from Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life, so you&#x27;ll hear no bad words from me. Needs more Pete &amp; Pete though.


Anyway, the highlight of Microsoft&#x27;s new Xbox Series X is undoubtedly the console itself, which transforms the machine&#x27;s usual oblong heft in the absolute most perfect way, turning it into a beaming yellow SpongeBob that would look at home in any living room - assuming the living room owners have very specific tastes. Additionally, it comes with a genuinely awesome controller featuring Squidward, Gary, and Mr. Krabs, plus a copy of All-Star Brawl 2.

                              <span>Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, has agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo and cease all operations in response to the Mario maker&#x27;s recent lawsuit.


News of Nintendo&#x27;s legal action against Yuzu surfaced last week, with the company claiming the emulator facilitated piracy &quot;at a colossal scale&quot;. By way of example, it said over 1m copies of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had been illegally downloaded ahead of its official launch - and that &quot;many&quot; pirate websites specified the game file was playable on Yuzu.


&quot;Defendant [Tropic Haze] is thus secondarily liable for the infringement committed by the users to whom it distributes Yuzu&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers argued, with the lawsuit ultimately seeking damages and demanding the emulator be shut down.

                              <span>This weekend, Fortnite simultaneously did something it had never done before, and something it hadn&#x27;t done in ages. On the game&#x27;s storied battle royale Island, players looked on as a giant hand made out of rapidly-cooling lava burst out of the ground, clasping an enormous treasure box that then lay, danging, high up in the air. 


The hand&#x27;s appearance had been much anticipated. Rhythmic rumblings had been tracked by fans to a spot outside Ruined Reels - a sort-of Greek amphitheature turned open-air cinema - and a slowly widening crack in the ground nearby. A new character, the aptly-named Odyssey, had already appeared nearby to dole out some much-needed exposition and teasing for Fortnite&#x27;s incoming Ancient Greek-themed new season. And outside the game, dataminers quickly discovered what was about to happen and posted it all on social media. The stage was set. 


So when the hand emerged, people knew what to do. That big box? It could be opened, if the chains around it were broken. And so players got to work. Some ignored Fortnite&#x27;s normal battle royale rules completely, sticking instead to simply landing on the Island and shooting/pickaxing the chest&#x27;s restraints, breaking them over the course of several hours, one-by-one. Others, predictably, decided to capitalise on all this by setting up camp nearby and sniping those trying to open the box. Debate raged about player etiquette - something which took me back to the outrage at people who wiped out upwards of 50-players at once as they settled in to watch Fortnite&#x27;s first ever in-game event, the rocket launch, back in 2018.

                              <span>Developer Crema has announced it&#x27;ll be removing all monetisation from its Pokemon-like creature-battler Temtem in an update scheduled for June, with one final major patch to follow before updates refocus on bug fixing and balance changes.


Crema shared the news in a lengthy post on Steam, which spent a lot of time addressing ongoing player complaints around a lack of major new content since launch, such as more islands, new Temtem, or additional multiplayer features. Broadly, the studio says Temtem&#x27;s early access demonstrated major new content didn&#x27;t have a significant impact on the game&#x27;s player base, making it difficult to justify the development resources required - although other issues, such as mounting technical debt, are also cited as concerns.


After a lot of words, including some regret over having described the game as an &quot;MMO&quot; in its marketing material, Crema gets to the crux of its post: that it will release two more major updates for Temtem before development switches to more modest bug fixing and balance patches, as the studio&#x27;s focus turns to new projects.

                              <span>Sandworms play a major part in Dune: Awakening, the big survival MMO coming some time soon from Funcom, the developers behind Conan: Exiles - but the game won&#x27;t feature the novel&#x27;s famous sandworm-riding come launch. And, presumably much more importantly for Conan fans, there&#x27;ll be no penis sliders either.
There will be sand-walking, though, and there&#x27;s no ruling out of sandworm-riding down the line. We spoke with Dune: Awakening&#x27;s creative director Joel Bylos at some length in our preview, and he explained the decision like this:
&quot;We actually looked into it. It&#x27;s just a very strong technical cost, and also a very - it needs a purpose. And we haven&#x27;t got what the movie has, which is like, &#x27;Go through the southern sandstorms, get to the southern part [of Arrakis]&#x27;. So yeah, we don&#x27;t have that yet.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Explore Jonesy&#x27;s whimsical chocolate factory!&quot; says the tagline for Jonesy&#x27;s Chocolate Factory Experience. Billed as appropriate for 3 years and above, and advertising fun and exploration, I used up 40GB of my precious, SSD space to install Fortnite and visit Jonesy&#x27;s whimsical chocolate factory.
Yes, I&#x27;m still thinking about the infamous Willy Wonka Experience held in a sadly-decorated warehouse in Glasgow. I didn&#x27;t visit it in real life for myself, but all of us have already been able to experience it vicariously through memes, quotes from frustrated parents, and interviews with the poor actors who had no idea what they were getting themselves into when they signed their contracts.
And now it&#x27;s in Fortnite. After trying it myself, I imagine the actual thing was pretty similar to Jonesy&#x27;s Chocolate Factory Experience, a Fortnite Creative map made by player ImSachiko. With a complimentary jelly bean being handed out and children crying in the corner, it does not disappoint.

Speaking to One More Game, the game&#x27;s director Naoki Hamaguchi said the Rebirth team had received &quot;a lot of feedback&quot; on the graphics in the game&#x27;s Performance mode from fans wondering if anything will be improved.
&quot;We hear you, and we are currently working on an update patch to improve that aspect,&quot; Hamaguchi said, adding he doesn&#x27;t think a release date will be &quot;far away from now&quot;.

                              <span>Marty O&#x27;Donnell, the former Bungie composer best known for his Halo and Destiny soundtracks, has announced his intention to run for US Congress as a Republican candidate. 


In a lengthy post on social media platform X, O&#x27;Donnell said he &quot;never wanted to be a politician and I still don&#x27;t&quot; but felt he needed to &quot;step up&quot; after seeing &quot;the leaders of our country being influenced by the toxic divisions that are tearing apart our families and society&quot;.


O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s campaign website is now live, with a notable Halo-esque vibe. Visitors can donate to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s war fund, learn more about the composer&#x27;s history in the video games industry, and &quot;join Marty&#x27;s army&quot; to receive campaign  updates.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s RPG Octopath Traveler has been delisted - temporarily, at least - from the Nintendo eShop.
The game&#x27;s disappearance was noticed at the end of last week, though it&#x27;s still available on Steam and the Microsoft Store.
Some fans have linked Octopath Traveler&#x27;s delisting due to an apparent change in publisher. Archived versions of the game&#x27;s eShop product page show that its publisher was changed from Nintendo to Square Enix a some point between 11th February and 1st March.

EA&#x27;s latest round of layoffs will affect five percent of staff - around 670 employees. The publisher said it planned to move away from &quot;future licensed IP&quot; toward its &quot;owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;. EA said this decision would not impact every team at the company directly.


 Now, developer Bit Reactor has shared an update on X, confirming its Star Wars strategy game was &quot;unaffected&quot; by the changes at EA.

                              <span>Steam&#x27;s done it again: another weekend, another concurrent user record broken and a new one set.
According to SteamDB, over 34.5 million of us were simultaneously online earlier today, setting an all-new concurrent user record of 34,649,583 players.
And of those players, 11,146,564 users weren&#x27;t just idling, but actively playing a game when the record was set.

                              <span>Greedfall 2: The Dying World will launch in early access.
Citing the game&#x27;s ambition as a reason, producer Reda Isber explained in a recent livestream that the team would be &quot;relying heavily&quot; on the feedback of players during the early access period to ensure development was &quot;heading in the right direction&quot;.
The team also alerted players that saves won&#x27;t be &quot;compatible between the various updates&quot;, so that&#x27;s something to bear in mind if you were thinking of getting involved.

Earlier this week, Ed reported Nintendo was suing the creators of Switch emulator Yuzu, claiming more than one million copies of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were pirated ahead of its release.
In the lawsuit, Nintendo claimed that by allowing Yuzu emulator users to play its games illegally by circumventing its software encryption, Tropic Haze facilitates piracy &quot;at a colossal scale&quot;.

                              <span>Researchers have demonstrated a worm that spreads through prompt injection. Details:
In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of an email assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it “jailbreaks the GenAI service” and ultimately steals data from the emails, Nassi says. “The generated response containing the sensitive user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,” Nassi says...</span>

That&#x27;s according to showrunner Jonathan Nolan, who told Total Film that it was the idea of telling an original story set in the Fallout universe that got Bethesda and the team &quot;most excited&quot; about the idea of a TV Show.
&quot;From the first conversation with Todd [Howard], we were most excited about an original story,&quot; Nolan said.

                              <span>According to SteamDB, Starfield&#x27;s Steam listing was recently updated, adding an &quot;unknown app&quot; to the Steam backend that&#x27;s widely speculated to be the Shattered Space DLC.
Whilst there&#x27;s been no formal word that the new content – which was bundled in with premium editions of the game – is coming any time soon, similar &quot;unknown apps&quot; were added to prior Bethesda games like Fallout 4, which later turned out to be expansions like Nuka-World and Valut-tec Workshop.
No, this is not definitive proof that any DLC is coming, let alone Shattered Space, but it&#x27;s our strongest hint yet that additional content is on the way for Starfield fans. So watch this space, eh?

                              <span>Still looking for that perfect gift for Mother&#x27;s Day? How about a curated selection of jewellery inspired by The Sims 4?
Based upon the Crystal Creations Stuff Pack that dropped last week, EA has released The Sims Plumbob Collection. Consisting of a necklace, ring, and earrings – all of which are sold separately – the set is made from 18k gold electroplated stainless steel with natural green agate.
All three pieces are available now on ShoptheSims.com, with the &quot;statement&quot; ring retailing for £41, the layered necklace for £39, and the drop earrings for £37. You&#x27;ll need to pay shipping and tax on top of that, too – that&#x27;s around £8 and £25, respectively, to ship to the UK.

As revealed by the team at yesterday&#x27;s Campfire Chat, The Gauntlet – which goes live on Tuesday 5th March – is a fixed, non-linear dungeon that &quot;will pit players of the same class against each other for top rank&quot;. The Gauntlet will reset at 4pm UK time every Tuesday, with the next trial going live at 6.15 p.m. the same day.
&quot;Obtain Proofs of Might by slaying demons, opening chests, and completing events,&quot; the team teased. &quot;Pillars are scattered throughout the Gauntlet and can increase the number of Proofs earned from each Monster kill.

                              <span>Bethesda has revealed that the next big Starfield update will deploy in Steam Beta form next week.
In a series of tweets posted to X/Twitter, the team confirmed that this update was focused on quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes in preparation for &quot;more features and content&quot; coming later this year.
The full details aren&#x27;t expected until next week, but Bethesda has teased that you&#x27;ll finally be able to use your scanner whilst harvesting resources or opening doors, and should you set course for an inactive mission, the UI will auto-magically set it active once more.

                              <span>Payday 3&#x27;s &quot;Operation Medic Bag&quot; patch is now available.
Bringing in &quot;key improvements and features&quot;, developer Starbreeze says the update is a &quot;focused effort responding to community expectations and improving the quality&quot; of the beleaguered FPS, and includes &quot;sought-after&quot; features as well as 300 tweaks to improve matchmaking, stability, and even the gameplay.
Described as a &quot;grand game improvement project&quot; – some of it resulting from a candid AMA hosted on Reddit earlier this month – Operation Medic Bag seeks to address all aspects of Payday 3. This first patch &quot;includes focus initiatives, such as rotating security modifiers, an unready button and improved controller settings&quot;, as well as support for various &quot;Nvidia technologies&quot;.

                              <span>EA and BioWare are &quot;pretty confident&quot; that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will be released later this year.
That&#x27;s according to industry insider Jeff Grubb, who said on yesterday&#x27;s Game Mess podcast that whilst it wasn&#x27;t clear when the game would next be shown, &quot;it will be released this year&quot;.
&quot;I suspect [Dragon Age: Dreadwolf] ] will probably pop up this summer,&quot; Grubb said (thanks, wccftech). &quot;I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;ll be shown, but [I] assume it will be shown sometime this summer. Could happen at any time, though.

                              <span>Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, the lovely looking musical adventure based on Tove Jansson&#x27;s classic series of children&#x27;s stories, finally has a released date and will be launching for Switch and PC via Steam on Tuesday, 7th March.


Melody of Moominvalley sees players slipping into the oversized green hat of the wanderer Snufkin, as he harnesses the power of music - and his trusty harmonica - to restore nature after the Park Keeper and his minions build hideous parks all over Moominvalley.


&quot;As Snufkin you will distract police officers, pull out signs, and knock over misplaced statues,&quot; explains Norweigian developer Hyper Games, &quot;as you vigorously try to restore nature and the inhabitants&#x27; home while putting an end to the industrious Park Keeper&#x27;s plans.&quot;

                              <span>Balatro, the poker-themed rogue-like from solo developer LocalThunk that&#x27;s been a huge critical and commercial hit since releasing last week, has been unexpectedly yanked from sale in some countries, with publisher Playstack blaming the issue on a surprise ratings change.


Playstack addressed the issue in a lengthy statement shared on social media, explaining Balatro&#x27;s temporary removal from console stores had so far only happened &quot;some countries&quot;. It admitted it could not &quot;estimate with complete confidence which stores&quot; had been impacted, adding, &quot;Our hope is that only a minority of stores will be affected&quot;. It says it remains &quot;highly confident&quot; Balatro will remain available on PC, including Steam.


The cause of all this frustration is an unexpected &quot;overnight change&quot; to Balatro&#x27;s age rating, which has been bumped from 3+ to 18+. According to Playstack, this change stems from an unspecified ratings board&#x27;s &quot;mistaken belief that the game &#x27;contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling&#x27;&quot;.

                              <span>Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has announced its dark action-RPG No Rest for the Wicked will launch into Steam early access on 18th April.


No Rest for the Wicked, which was unveiled during last year&#x27;s The Game Awards, is described by Moon Studios as an &quot;expansive&quot; and &quot;visceral&quot; action-RPG that&#x27;s &quot;set to reinvent the genre&quot;. It casts players as a Cerim - a holy warrior &quot;imbued with remarkable powers&quot; - who embarks on a journey across the harsh Isola Sacra to defeat an unholy plague.


Its campaign promises a &quot;mature, dark&quot; narrative, as well as &quot;brutal, precision-based&quot; combat, and a hand-crafted world, with players can take on No Rest for the Wicked&#x27;s challenges, quests, and bosses either solo or with up to three friends by their side.

                              <span>Four new cast members have been announced for The Last of Us Season 2.
As reported by Variety, Danny Ramirez, Tati Gabrielle, Ariela Barer and Spencer Lord have all joined HBO&#x27;s adaptation. Those who have played The Last of Us Part 2 will recognise their characters as members of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF).
Ramirez, whose previous acting credits include Top Gun: Maverick and Marvel&#x27;s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, will play Manny. The show&#x27;s description states Manny is &quot;a loyal soldier whose sunny outlook belies the pain of old wounds and a fear that he will fail his friends when they need him most&quot;. Barer, meanwhile, will play Mel, described as &quot;a young doctor whose commitment to saving lives is challenged by the realities of war and tribalism&quot;.

This year marks the fourth annual Frost Fatales event -  which, like its summertime equivalent Flame Fatales, is specifically intended to showcase women and femmes in the speedrunning community - and proceedings get underway this Sunday, 3rd March, at 5.30pm UK time.


Then, across the next seven days, Frost Fatales has scheduled over 60 speedruns - which, as always, cover a broad spectrum of games, including acclaimed indies, retro classics, and oddities, with a small selection of more modern blockbusters also putting in an appearance.

                              <span>Developers at GTA 6 studio Rockstar Games have criticised the company for telling employees they must return to the office full-time next month, calling leadership&#x27;s decision &quot;reckless&quot;.
As reported yesterday, employees at Rockstar have been told to return to the office five days a week, now that GTA 6 is entering the final stretch of development. Studio management cited security and productivity reasons for this upcoming change, which will come into effect in April.
Since this announcement, the Independent Workers&#x27; Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has blasted Rockstar for its plans to withdraw remote working provisions for the &quot;majority&quot; of its staff, noting the studio said any exceptions to the new rules will be &quot;rare&quot;.

Venba&#x27;s Cookbook DLC will arrive on 13th March and - even better - when it does arrive, it will be free for all owners of the base game. 


Venba&#x27;s upcoming DLC will offer players a way to look through detailed recipes for the dishes made in the game. This is something, let&#x27;s be honest, we all wanted while playing along. Everything just looked (and sounded) so delicious.

A message sent around the official Arrowhead Discord this morning warned the community of these fake games, stating that the only legitimate releases were Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2: Super Citizen Edition with the correct release date of 8th February.
&quot;People posting as us trying to scam people is obviously very sad and frustrating, and for that as well as for security reasons we urge you to stay clear of them,&quot; Arrowhead&#x27;s community manager wrote. &quot;Again, the only two Helldivers 2 products we market are Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2 Super Citizen Edition.&quot;

                              <span>Crash Team Rumble will have no further content updates after 4th March, less than nine months after its launch.
The strategic platformer MOBA launched on 20th June 2023 on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Since then it&#x27;s had three seasons of new content, the latest being a crossover with Spyro the Dragon.
There will be no further seasons, however, per an in-game news update spotted by players of Crash Team Rumble. As of yet, there&#x27;s been no official announcement from publisher Activision itself.

                              <span>Destiny 2 is adding a new kind of vehicle - the hoverboard-esque Skimmer - in its next update due on Tuesday, 5th March. 


Skimmers will let players zoom around looking cool, pull off tricks and even grind on rails. They&#x27;ll live alongside Sparrows - the game&#x27;s traditional Star Wars speeder bikes - in your inventory.


As with anything fun or cool, the first hit is free - all players will get a Skimmer as part of the upcoming Guardian Games All-Stars event. A second Skimmer &quot;inspired by a beloved Destiny weapon&quot; will be available to buy via Destiny 2&#x27;s Eververse microtransaction shop.

                              <span>Another Thursday, another Epic Games Store freebie to add to your ever-growing backlog, this time in the form of stylish 3D side-scroller Never Yield.


Never Yield - also known as Aerial_Knight&#x27;s Never Yield to ensure you don&#x27;t forget who developed it - released back in 2021, offering up an experience something like a classic endless runner. It sees players stampeding across a strikingly designed future Tokyo, all to a winning soundtrack created by Detroit artist Danime-Sama.


&quot;Take the role of Wally,&quot; explains Never Yield&#x27;s official description. &quot;A mysterious character that has recovered what was taken from him. Hopefully, you&#x27;re fast enough to outrun your enemies. Expose the truth and try to uncover the mystery of what happened to them.&quot;

                              <span>Vampire Survivors might continue to be suspiciously devoid of vampires, but it does now have a bunch of new cosmic sci-fi bits (clearly last year&#x27;s Among Us collaboration just wasn&#x27;t space-y enough), courtesy of its latest free update on Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and mobile.


Space 54, as the update is known, introduces a new bonus stage going by the same name - officially described as a &quot;cosmic border-realm between this plane of existence and a sinister, third dimension&quot; - as well as two new characters to deploy.


One of those characters, Space Dude, is the star of developer Poncle&#x27;s energetic Space 54 trailer (or Space-54, or Space54 - the studio doesn&#x27;t seem to have entirely made its mind up), and there&#x27;s also four new weapons, a new relic, and seven new EXTRA achievements.

                              <span>Terminator: Survivors, the previously untitled open-world Terminator game announced by publisher Nacon back in July 2022, has resurfaced with a new cinematic trailer and a Steam early access launch day of 24th October this year.


Terminator: Survivors is being developed by Nacon Studio Milan, the team behind motorcycle racer Rims Racing and TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3, and is set four years after the catastrophic Judgment Day prophesised in the first two Terminator films.


Cast as a survivor of humanity&#x27;s near-extinction, players - either working solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - must attempt to &quot;reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating you and the last vestiges of mankind.&quot;

                              <span>Toys for Bob - the Activision Blizzard studio behind the likes of Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot 4, and the Spyro remasters - has announced it&#x27;s parting ways with Activision to become an independent company once more. It also says it&#x27;s &quot;exploring a possible partnership&quot; with Microsoft as development on its new game gets underway.


Toys for Bob, which was founded back in 1989, formed a publishing partnership with Activision in the 2000s that would lead to the studio&#x27;s acquisition by the publisher in 2005. Toys for Bob has been part of Activision Blizzard ever since, initially working on the hugely popular toys-to-life Skylanders series before developing 2018 remaster Spyro Reignited Trilogy and 2020&#x27;s well-received Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. Since then, it&#x27;s served as a support studio for Call of Duty while also releasing last year&#x27;s Crash Team Rumble.


Earlier this month, following Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard and subsequent decision to lay off 1,900 workers across its Xbox teams, it was confirmed 86 Toys for Bob employees had lost their jobs. It was also reported the studio&#x27;s physical office would be shutting down and that remaining staff would transition to working from home. And it&#x27;s in this context that Toys for Bob has now announced it&#x27;s splitting from Activision to go independent.

                              <span>Following reports last year that Embracer Group was considering selling Borderlands studio Gearbox as part of its ongoing &quot;comprehensive restructuring programme&quot;, it&#x27;s now being claimed a sale to a third party is in the &quot;late stages&quot; of being finalised.


That&#x27;s according to Kotaku, which says Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford had previously told staff the studio was facing one of three possible scenarios: it would either stay with Embracer, be sold, or would finance a buyout and become independent once more. However, Pitchford reportedly shared an update with employees earlier this week, saying a decision had been made - and that decision, according to Kotaku&#x27;s sources, was to sell.


The publication understands Gearbox&#x27;s sale to an unnamed buyer is currently in the &quot;late stages of being finalised&quot;, and while Embracer Group - which purchased Gearbox for $363m in 2021 - did not respond to Kotaku&#x27;s requests for comment, Pitchford deflected the website&#x27;s inquiries, saying, &quot;We will be thrilled to share whenever we have projects to announce or news to share as we work hard towards our mission to entertain the world.&quot;

                              <span>Leap day is now upon us and a couple of games aren&#x27;t happy about this sudden affront to their usual calendar expectations. Both EA Sports WRC and Theatrhythm Final Bar Line are currently protesting at the arrival of 29th February by refusing to function on consoles - but, luckily for rally fans and beat tappers, there&#x27;s a pretty straightforward workaround.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line players noticed the Final Fantasy-themed PS4 and Switch rhythm game was failing to connect to Square Enix&#x27;s servers after the clock struck midnight heralding the arrival 29th February, leaving it functionally unplayable.


Similarly, EA took to social media earlier today to acknowledge Codemasters&#x27; World Championship Rally was encountering an &quot;issue on console in which the game may crash on startup.&quot; And while it didn&#x27;t explicitly blame the problem on today&#x27;s leap year, the publisher&#x27;s follow-up solution makes it clear 29th February is the culprit.

The CSF 2.0, which supports implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, has an expanded scope that goes beyond protecting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and power plants, to all organizations in any sector. It also has a new focus on governance, which encompasses how organizations make and carry out informed decisions on cybersecurity strategy.

One of the most popular ways developers use Kubernetes-related services is via cloud providers, but
have you ever wondered how cloud providers can do that? How does this whole process of integration
of Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let&#x27;s put the spotlight on SIG
Cloud Provider.
SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud
providers. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear
standards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is
their responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations.

                              <span>Embracer Group is set to sell Saber Interactive in a deal worth up to $500m, according to a report from Bloomberg.



Saber will continue to work on its remake of Star Wars: The Knights of the Old Republic after development was removed from Aspyr in 2022.


This deal is just the latest from Embracer as part of its restructuring programme that&#x27;s already seen over a thousand staff laid off and studios closed.

                              <span>Amazon is offering eight games to Prime Gaming subscribers in March, including Fallout 2 and Invincible Presents: Atom Eve. 
The month will start out with Fallout 2 to promote Amazon&#x27;s upcoming Fallout adaptation, which is set to premiere on 12th April. We got a good look at the show in December when Amazon released a teaser trailer, following numerous set leaks and official promotional photos.
If you haven&#x27;t played it, Fallout 2 is one of the classic RPGs which still holds up today. In 2017, Eurogamer was able to visit Obsidian Entertainment and speak to Feargus Urquhart, Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain, who all previously worked on Fallout 1 and 2 whilst at Interplay Productions.

                              <span>Sony-acquired studio Firesprite has recently suffered high profile exits amid accusations of a toxic workplace culture, Eurogamer has been told, as part of an investigation into the studio begun ahead of the layoffs announced by Sony this week.


The Liverpool-based developer released PlayStation VR2 launch title Horizon Call of the Mountain last year, after being acquired by Sony in 2021. But the impact of crunch for that game&#x27;s release and changes in the company&#x27;s senior leadership have subsequently led to discontent within the studio, staff have told Eurogamer - something one source described as &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;.


Most concerning are reports from sources that two senior leaders from Sony support studio XDev, brought in to help lead Firesprite, have since been accused of sexual discrimination and ageism. A subsequent internal investigation by Sony is said to have resulted in the claims being dismissed as a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.

To honour today&#x27;s release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Google has hidden a little Chocobo treat for us all. All you have to do is type the words &quot;Chocobo&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; into the search bar, and you will be met with a little Chocobo icon in the lower right corner.
Hit this button, and soon your screen will be full of charging Chocobos, their feet pounding away making everything shake and shimmy. Cloud even pops up riding on the back of one, his Buster Sword held aloft as though he is riding into battle. You can see how it looks in the video below.

                              <span>If you, like the rest of the internet, have been swept up in the trainwreck that was the Willy Wonka Experience held in an empty warehouse in Glasgow last weekend, we have good news. While you may no longer be able to witness the real event in person, you can always relive it vicariously through your Sims. 
Glasgow&#x27;s Willy Wonka Experience has gone viral for its emptily-decorated space, its AI-generated scripts, and the random shadowy figure called The Unknown who was scaring children.
The whole thing went so badly, it was cancelled halfway through Saturday after police were called to the event, but not before someone could snap one of the most memorable pictures from it - a sad Oompa Loompa being forced to conduct experiments by event organiser House of Illuminati.

                              <span>Today I learned there is a Dungeons and Dragons-like Game Master (GM) working behind the scenes on Helldivers 2.
His name is Joel, and his job title at Arrowhead is, well, Game Master. &quot;We have a lot of systems built into the game where the Game Master has a lot of control over the play experience. It&#x27;s something that we&#x27;re continuously evolving based on what&#x27;s happening in the game,&quot; Helldivers 2 game director Johan Pilestedt told PC Gamer.
This continuous evolution has actually seen Joel getting up at unsociable hours to sort out situations when the Helldivers 2 team realised the game wasn&#x27;t as balanced as it could be. &quot;There have been some sudden moments where maybe one planet was too easy or one was too hard and [Joel] had to get up in the middle of the night to give the Automatons a bit of reinforcement so the players don&#x27;t take [the planet] too quickly,&quot; Pilestedt said.

                              <span>Larian has released another Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 hotfix across PC, PS5 and Mac. It is expected to arrive on Xbox at a later date. 


This hotfix takes aim at several bugs and quirks still lingering in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. This includes a fix for banding and shader issues in cinematics and those times characters claimed to be too busy to talk to you. &quot;They were lying,&quot; Larian explained.
Meanwhile, Minthara should no longer refuse to follow along with the party in Acts 2 and 3. In the developer&#x27;s own words: &quot;You should find her more willing to fall in line now - at least in terms of keeping up. She&#x27;s still something of a free spirit.&quot;

We already knew these were on the way - the game&#x27;s Report for Duty trailer (below) features mechs captioned &quot;coming soon after launch&quot;, plus the first game featured mechs.


But now that server issues due to the game&#x27;s popularity have been sorted, it seems developer Arrowhead Studios is finally moving on to more interesting improvements.

Ascendant Studios founder Bret Robbins, who also served as creative director on the first Dead Space game, made the comment in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz reflecting on the launch and future of the developer&#x27;s debut game.
Despite initial poor sales and lacklustre reviews for Immortals of Aveum when it released in August 2023, Robbins said he believes the game&#x27;s future will be successful like Dead Space. &quot;People were discovering [Dead Space] for years and years,&quot; Robbins stated, &quot;I think Immortals will be the same.&quot;

                              <span>Employees at Rockstar have been asked to return to the office five days a week, now that GTA 6 enters its final year of development.
As reported by Bloomberg, an email sent to staff by Rockstar&#x27;s head of publishing Jenn Kolbe stated the decision to end hybrid work was made - in part - with security reasons in mind.
Rockstar was the subject of a high profile hack in 2022, in which over 90 screenshots and videos were released online showing work on the then unannounced GTA 6. Then, last year, the studio released its first official GTA 6 trailer ahead of schedule, after it too leaked online.

Ridgeline - previously led by ex-Halo co-creator Lehto - had been working on a narrative-led Battlefield campaign. The project will now be completed by Need for Speed studio Criterion Games.


Writing on social media platform X last night, Lehto said: &quot;Gut punched to see EA lay off my team. So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise.&quot;

                              <span>Following its decision to cut six percent of its workforce last March, EA has announced another round of layoffs - this time affecting 5 percent of staff (around 670 employees) - as it moves away from &quot;future licensed IP&quot; toward its &quot;owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;.


In an email to staff announcing today&#x27;s layoffs, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said the cuts were part of a continuing effort to &quot;optimise our global real estate footprint to best support our business&quot;. 


In order to achieve its goals, Wilson said EA will be &quot;streamlining [its] company operations&quot;, &quot;sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry&quot;. Additionally, it&#x27;ll &quot;double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;.

DreadXP&#x27;s newly announced Paranormal Activity project, which follows the launch of last year&#x27;s VR-focused Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul from VRWERX, is being made in conjunction with Paramount Game Studios and promises to &quot;bring the franchise&#x27;s groundbreaking found-footage style to horror enthusiasts in surprising new ways&quot;.


Specifics are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but DarkStone Digital (AKA solo developer Brian Clarke, who&#x27;s also co-director and creative director of DreadXP) makes mention of a dynamic &quot;haunt system&quot; in the new Paranormal Activity game&#x27;s press release, said to alter the types and intensity of scares tplayers encounter based on their actions.

Warzone Mobile, which is being developed by Activision&#x27;s Digital Legends, Beenox, Shanghai, and Solid State studios, initially launched in Australia back in November 2022. Following its roll-out across a number of other countries, Activision announced it would be getting its full release in autumn last year - but plans changed in October, when the publisher confirmed it had made the decision to postpone its launch to &quot;spring&quot; 2024 in order to &quot;polish up&quot; the experience.


With Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&#x27;s worldwide release now locked down to 21st March, Activision has started talking specifics, confirming the game will launch with two maps: Verdansk - which supports 120-player battle royale matches - and Rebirth Island, which supports 48-player battle royale matches using Gulag-free Resurgence rules.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the shocking news that the next big Pokémon game is mysteriously set to arrive in 2025. Hey, that sounds a lot like the intro to last week&#x27;s episode, when we were discussing Switch 2! Say, could Pokémon Legends: Z-A also be set to arrive on Nintendo&#x27;s next console?
It&#x27;s been a long time since Nintendo didn&#x27;t launch a major Pokémon game or expansion in a calendar year, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A&#x27;s arrival in 2025 certainly looks suspicious - as does yesterday&#x27;s reveal of the game without any look at actual gameplay.
So, have we just been given another piece of the Switch 2 puzzle? What do we expect to see in the mysterious Z-A when it is fully revealed? And how many bad French-themed Pokémon ideas can we come up with? With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Ahmed Best, who&#x27;s best known for his performance as Jar-Jar Binks in the Star Wars prequels, has issued a cryptic tease that has set Star Wars fans&#x27; tongues wagging.


&quot;Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in,&quot; Best posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of himself clad in a performance capture suit. He accompanied the caption with a string of hashtags:  &quot;#mocap #starwars #jarjarbinks #activision #jedi #sithlord #kelleranbeq&quot;


It&#x27;s unclear what Best is back in a performance capture suit for, though the mention of Activision has fans pondering whether the actor is secretly working on a new Star Wars game from the publisher, or whether he&#x27;s performing mo-cap for some kind of Call of Duty crossover.

As previously reported, Sloclap&#x27;s third-person brawler Sifu will be arriving on the service next month. It will be available on both PlayStation 4 and PS5. Joining it are  three other games - or rather, two others plus the Destiny 2: Witch Queen expansion (for which you&#x27;ll need Destiny 2 in your library to play).

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait for UFO 50 - the 50-strong anthology of 8-bit-inspired games from Spelunky creator Derek Yu&#x27;s Mossmouth studio - but as the seventh anniversary of its announcement approaches this August, Yu has revealed the promising project is currently on track to release in the second half of this year.


When UFO 50 was announced in 2017, the goal was to launch it the following year; that, obviously, did&#x27;t happen, with Yu last year explaining the longer-the-expected development time was simply down to the team having wildly underestimated how long it would take to make 50 games, particularly given Spelunky 2 was being made in the middle of it all.


UFO 50, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, isn&#x27;t a mini- or micro-game compilation, but a collection of complete 8-bit game experiences (albeit of varying sizes) created as if from a long-forgotten fictional 80s video game company, with sequels and reappearing characters creating a sense of shared continuity. It promises everything from platformers and shoot &#x27;em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and RPGs, with over half featuring local multiplayer including co-op and versus play.

                              <span>Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games has suffered layoffs amid unrest due to relocation and accusations of a &quot;highly toxic company&quot;, reports suggest.


Game director Todd Papy left the studio last month, according to LinkedIn. MassivelyOP has since reported a number of other high profile losses at the company (via Game Developer), including lead producer Jake Ross, level designer Dane Kubicka, Austin QA lead Vincent Sinatra, and Austin senior QA analyst Andrew Rexroth.




Further, former producer Annie Bouffard shared on LinkedIn that she had resigned from a &quot;highly toxic company&quot; and claimed she was &quot;gaslighted&quot; when she expressed concern about potential layoffs. She said mass layoffs had been disguised as a &quot;relocation of staff&quot; when few were able or willing to move.

                              <span>If you are playing through Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered on the Epic Games Store, you may find it is a little different to other versions.
As noted by Small Medipack, the Epic Games Store version  has a range of improvements when compared to other platforms. For example, the Nevada level in Tomb Raider 3 is, overall, &quot;more polished&quot;, thanks to better textures and animations.
Meanwhile, there are more poses on the Epic Games Store version&#x27;s photo mode - 21 in total.

                              <span>We&#x27;re now 20 years on from the release of The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run and we&#x27;re still without a sequel. That said, we now have a nightmarish glimpse into what could have been, perhaps, with a Mario Kart parody sequence in the latest episode of the animated series. 
Episode 12 of season 35, Lisa Gets an F1, aired on 25th February, and follows Lisa as she becomes a professional kid go-kart racer whilst dealing with her anxiety stemming from Homer&#x27;s dangerous driving. As Homer worries about Lisa&#x27;s safety, one night he has a nightmare where he, Lisa, and a number of other children are driving in an off-kilter version of Mario Kart.
&quot;It&#x27;s me, Lisa Mario,&quot; Lisa proclaims at the starting line of Rainbow Road, fully decked out with a blue hat, moustache, and her dress altered to look like Mario&#x27;s overalls. She&#x27;s joined by Ralph dressed up as Toad, Nelson tranformed into Bowser, and one of the Mackleberry twins as Princess Peach.

                              <span>A new documentary has shed more light on Resident Evil 4 Remake&#x27;s development, and shows its director concerned the game would not be ready for its release date.
A recent episode of 100 Cameras - a Japanese documentary series which puts 100 cameras in situ to capture the goings on in any given place - focused on Capcom. Along with a look behind the scenes of Street Fighter 6, the episode also showed a slice of Resident Evil 4 Remake&#x27;s development (thanks, GamesRadar).
At the time of recording, there was only one month left before Resident Evil 4 Remake was set to release, but the game was reportedly riddled with a &quot;storm&quot; of issues. These included game freezes, visual glitches such as characters&#x27; hands not connecting when they are meant to be holding on to each other, and Leon getting sent to &quot;another dimension&quot; as he falls through the floor. One tester said they had found &quot;around 70&quot; new bugs in one day. Things were once so bad, Resident Evil 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Anpo admitted: &quot;At this rate, we won&#x27;t make the release&quot;.

The studio&#x27;s first project will be a AAA first-person game built in Unreal Engine 5 and set in an original universe &quot;with an emphasis on co-operative gameplay&quot;, a press release stated.

                              <span>Fans are hopeful that expansion The Answer will come to Persona 3 Reload after dataminers discovered references to DLC.


Persona 3 Reload released last month as a remake of the 2006 original. However, it was criticised for being incomplete without the inclusion of The Answer expansion and the female protagonist featured in revised versions Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable.


The latest hint to an expansion comes from YouTuber Faz (thanks PCGamer), who discovered an in-game message for completing the game on the highest Merciless difficulty (or at least using a cheat engine to skip ahead).

These reductions at the studio come as part of yesterday&#x27;s announcement that 900 PlayStation employees will lose their jobs across multiple studios and departments. In total, this equates to eight percent of PlayStation&#x27;s workforce.
According to Dutch newspaper AD (via VGC), Guerilla is set to lay off 40 employees, about 10 percent of its staff. Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment.

The lawsuit is against Tropic Haze, the creator of the Yuzu game emulator, which Nintendo said allows users to play its games illegally by circumventing its software encryption.


As such, Nintendo claimed Yuzu facilitates piracy &quot;at a colossal scale&quot;, with pirated versions of Tears of the Kingdom used as an example.

That&#x27;s according to group behind the alleged attack, Mogilevich, as reported by Cyber Daily. Epic Games is yet to respond.


The hacked data allegedly includes &quot;email, passwords, full name, payment information, source code and many other data&quot; - though it&#x27;s unclear if this refers to the details of Epic Games employees, customers, or both.
