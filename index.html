                    <span>Microsoft has explained why it created a &quot;Min Spec Mode&quot; for Age of Empires 4.

Maple Lodge Campsite is Phasmophobia&#x27;s first outdoor map and packs in everything you could possibly hope for in a spooky holiday retreat, including picnic areas, tents, a log cabin, and even a haunted lake. Developer Kinetic Games says the new map features &quot;more unique objects, higher object density and more visual detail&quot;, and that players can expect other maps to receive a similar boost in detail, plus more unique objects, at a later date.

Activision Blizzard moved to pause legal proceedings following a messy tussle between California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), which had launched the original lawsuit against the publisher, and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) - which had previously announced an $18m settlement deal with Activision as part of its own investigation into the company.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard is letting every Battle.net user change their name for free.
The change comes in the wake of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s committment to changing its &quot;frat boy&quot; culture following California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit. Following accusations of sexual harassment against the developer the character is named after, Overwatch&#x27;s fan-favourite cowboy character Jesse McCree has been given a new name and will be known as Cole Cassidy when an update rolls out on Tuesday, 26th October. Consequently, Activision Blizzard is extending the opportunity of a name-change to its players, too.

Though barely a minute long, the new teaser shows off a decidedly less supernatural premise. &quot;You wanna know what it means to be a killer?&quot; an off-camera narrator muses, before we&#x27;re subjected to a raft of bloody images - a syringe, a beating heart, a bloody smear on a tiled wall - and what looks to be an assortment of DIY surgical experiments. Ew.

                    <span>Overwatch&#x27;s fan-favourite cowboy character Jesse McCree finally has a new name after Activision Blizzard committed to changing it in the wake of California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture at the company. Henceforth, Jesse McCree will be known as Cole Cassidy.
McCree is just one of many characters across Blizzard&#x27;s portfolio to have taken his name from a developer at the company. However, back in August, Blizzard announced it would be renaming the cowboy after the real-life Jesse McCree, who had been named in several accounts of the studio&#x27;s toxic work culture, was confirmed to have departed the company amid the fallout from the lawsuit - although no reason for his exit was given.

LightBasin (aka UNC1945) is an activity cluster that has been consistently targeting the telecommunications sector at a global scale since at least 2016, leveraging custom tools and an in-depth knowledge of telecommunications network architectures.
Recent findings highlight this cluster’s extensive knowledge of telecommunications protocols, including the emulation of these protocols to facilitate command and control (C2) and utilizing scanning/packet-capture tools to retrieve highly specific information from mobile communication infrastructure, such as subscriber information and call metadata.

                    <span>Nvidia has announced a raft of upgrades for its GeForce Now cloud streaming service with a new premium tier offering RTX 3080 class graphics performance, allowing for 1440p120 gameplay across a range of platforms and 4K60 HDR, limited for now to Shield Android TV devices. New latency reductions techniques are also promised, with Nvidia making bold claims about input lag up against competing cloud technologies - and even local devices.
All of this is made possible via brand new class of server blade Nvidia is bringing online, dubbed the &#x27;SuperPod&#x27;. While you&#x27;re not getting to an actual RTX 3080 as such, you are getting equivalent enterprise-class hardware based on the same GA-102 silicon, backed up by an eight-core, 16 thread AMD Threadripper processor working in combination with ultra-fast PCIe Gen 4.0 solid-state storage and an impressive 28GB of 3200MHz DDR4 memory. This gives the SuperPod top-class graphics performance (only an RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3090 are faster in the Nvidia stack), though CPU performance would fall a little short of the latest Ryzen 5000 and Intel CPUs.

                    <span>Volition&#x27;s first reveal of its upcoming Saints Row reboot did not, it&#x27;s fair to say, seem to bare much in common with the series of old. A few gameplay snippets that followed helped bridge the divide, but a newly revealed look at some early missions has given the clearest indication yet of how Volition is looking to revitalise its ageing sandbox series.
As shared by GameInformer, the new nine-minute pre-alpha gameplay video offers a look at two early story missions: Making Rent and Idol Threat. The first of these takes place before the Saints are even officially formed, with The Boss and the game&#x27;s core supporting - Kevin, Neenah, and Eli, all previously members of rival gangs - orchestrating a robbery on a loan office to raise some cash.

The first time I heard of this issue was from a Midwest CEO. His organization had been hit by ransomware to the tune of $10M. Operationally, they were still recovering nearly a year later. And, embarrassingly, it was his most trusted VP who let the attackers in. It turns out that the VP had approved over 10 different push-based messages for logins that he was not involved in. When the VP was asked why he approved logins for logins he was not actually doing, his response was, “They (IT) told me that I needed to click on Approve when the message appeared!”...</span>

The freshly leaked trailer - which has surfaced online ahead of a rumoured official reveal tomorrow, 21st October - has been popping up across the internet throughout the day, with Sony&#x27;s lawyers fighting a losing battle of whack-a-mole in a bid to take it down.

                    <span>Here’s a story of someone who, with three compatriots, rented textbooks from Amazon and then sold them instead of returning them. They used gift cards and prepaid credit cards to buy the books, so there was no available balance when Amazon tried to charge them the buyout price for non-returned books. They also used various aliases and other tricks to bypass Amazon’s fifteen-book limit. In all, they stole 14,000 textbooks worth over $1.5 million.
The article doesn’t link to the indictment, so I don’t know how they were discovered.

                    <span>Players hoping to get stuck into Techland&#x27;s impressive Switch port of Dying Light have run into a pretty significant hurdle while trying to purchase the zombies-and-parkour shooter from Nintendo&#x27;s eShop; the digital version is currently unavailable in the UK and across Europe as a result of Dying Light being banned from sale in Germany.
Switch players began flagging Dying Light: Platinum Edition&#x27;s unexpected absence from eShop in multiple territories, despite its 19th October release date, over on Reddit. The mystery was eventually solved by an official Techland spokesperson, who explained the issue stems from the fact Nintendo&#x27;s European eShop is registered in Germany - a country where Dying Light is currently unrated and thus prohibited from sale.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve found yourself tantalised by Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming extreme sports game Riders Republic, but not so much that you&#x27;re quite ready to commit, you might like to get involved in the newly announced Free Trial week, giving players up to four hours with the full game ahead of launch.
Riders Republic, a spiritual successor to 2016&#x27;s underrated Steep, expands on the open-world winter sports action of that game to usher in a fuller roster of activities. There&#x27;s skiing, snowboarding, biking, and wing suits (of the vanilla and jet-powered varieties), playable both solo and competitively, with Ubisoft&#x27;s heavily pushing the game&#x27;s large-scale competitions for upward of 50 players.

                    <span>Yesterday, Valve unveiled a new compatibility ratings system for Steam Deck, intended to give users a clear indication of how well specific Steam games will run on the upcoming portable gaming PC. And now, a new beta update for Half-Life 2 has been discovered, seemingly released to ensure the seminal FPS meets the requirements needed to earn Steam Deck&#x27;s top-tier Verified compatibility badge.
Half-Life 2&#x27;s new beta branch update, as spotted and detailed by Valve watcher Tyler McVicker on YouTube, reportedly covers a surprising amount of ground, not only making adjustments to the way the UI and resolution are handled in-game - primarily to ensure Half-Life 2 fits Steam Deck&#x27;s aspect ratio and remains legible at the machine&#x27;s relatively diminutive size - but addressing some long-standing bugs as well.

Supposedly this is a promotional trailer for next year&#x27;s much-anticipated Pokémon Legends: Arceus. But really, it feels more like Pokémon&#x27;s take on Blair Witch. Lavender Town was nothing on this.

                    <span>A new mobile game has been created in collaboration with the World Health Organisation to raise COVID-19 vaccine awareness.
Called Antidote COVID-19, its tagline &quot;I am the Shield&quot; is representative of a desire to increase awareness of coronavirus vaccination and other preventative measures.

                    <span>Yesterday, Fortnite set tongues wagging when it revealed that both Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya would be joining the battle royale via their Dune characters. 
Artwork for the skins also included one of Dune&#x27;s big ol&#x27; sandworms, though now with Fishstick&#x27;s head. Long-time Dune fans reacted with typical skepticism as their beloved series was brought into 21st century pop culture.

The app update will make it far easier for users to access their game media on their phone to share straight to social media, rather than sharing directly from the console with its awkward typing function.

In February, Canadian-based device customisation company Dbrand launched its replacement PS5 plates, dubbed Darkplates, with a brazen attitude towards the prospect of a Sony takedown.

                    <span>Researchers trained a machine-learning system on videos of people typing their PINs into ATMs:
By using three tries, which is typically the maximum allowed number of attempts before the card is withheld, the researchers reconstructed the correct sequence for 5-digit PINs 30% of the time, and reached 41% for 4-digit PINs.

This works even if the person is covering the pad with their hands.

                    <span>According to a report from CISA last week, there were three ransomware attacks against water treatment plants last year.
WWS Sector cyber intrusions from 2019 to early 2021 include:
In August 2021, malicious cyber actors used Ghost variant ransomware against a California-based WWS facility. The ransomware variant had been in the system for about a month and was discovered when three supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers displayed a ransomware message.
In July 2021, cyber actors used remote access to introduce ZuCaNo ransomware onto a Maine-based WWS facility’s wastewater SCADA computer. The treatment system was run manually until the SCADA computer was restored using local control and more frequent operator rounds.

The post will show you how to create a specialized service kube-proxy
style network proxier using Kubernetes Proxy NG
kpng without interfering
with the existing kube-proxy. The kpng project aims at renewing the
the default Kubernetes Service implementation, the &quot;kube-proxy&quot;. An
important feature of kpng is that it can be used as a library to
create proxiers outside K8s. While this is useful for CNI-plugins that
replaces the kube-proxy it also opens the possibility for anyone to
create a proxier for a special purpose.
Define a service that uses a specialized proxier

                    <span>Pokémon Unite, like almost all live-service games at this spookiest time of the year, is getting in on the Halloween action with a  major new patch that will, among other things, add the (not especially spooky) squirrel-like Pokémon Greedent.
Greedent makes a brief appearance in Pokémon Unite&#x27;s new Halloween Festival reveal trailer, but specifics regarding its abilities are pretty limited right now. Instead, we&#x27;re mostly treating to the spooky stuff, which includes a Halloween-y map makeover, replete with pumpkins and other seasonal trimmings.

As outlined in Valve&#x27;s latest video, all games on Steam will fall into one of four categories - Verified, Playable, Unsupported, and Unknown - giving Steam Deck users an easy, at-a-glance means of checking compatibility with their system.

Ash should be immediately recognisable to fans of Respawn&#x27;s previous work, given the formidable simulacrum played a prominent role in Titanfall 2 - but should also be familiar to Apex Legends players too, having been restored during Season 5&#x27;s Broken Ghost quest.

Outriders initially launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation back in April, delivering a slice of co-operative sci-fi shooter action Eurogamer reviewer Vikki Blake enjoyed, albeit with some provisos, in her review. &quot;For some,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I suspect Outriders doesn&#x27;t innovate enough to stand out from an already oversaturated shooter market, relying too much on the ideas of other, stronger titles that have come before it.&quot;

                    <span>With the Analogue Pocket set for release later this year, some new details about the device and future Analogue products has surfaced with the reveal of Analogue OS.

The library feature is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects. This database of information, accessible directly from the device, was seemingly curated with the goal of identifying any and all variants of a game. For games which have had dozens of revisions, including different regions, the library can provide all relevant information. This could even help identify pirate carts as simply inserting the game into the unit will provide information about that specific cartridge. Knowing how common pirated Game Boy cartridges have become, this could become a quick way to identify legit carts for collectors.

                    <span>Valve has banned all blockchain games from Steam.
The developer of Age of Rust, a blockchain game that uses NFTs, took to Twitter to say it had been notified that Steam &quot;will be kicking *all blockchain games* off the platform, including Age of Rust, because NFTs have value&quot;.

Two years on, the meme still lingers and Microsoft has announced you&#x27;ll be able to pre-order your very own official Xbox Series X mini fridge starting next Tuesday.
Microsoft initially embraced the Xbox fridge meme (with considerably gusto) last October, when it sent real Xbox Series X fridges - 6-foot, 400 pound, 1:1 scale replicas of the console - out to influencers and rapper Snoop Dogg. The gag was resurrected once again this March when Microsoft produced some mini fridge variants of the full-sized design to use as prizes in a promotion for Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson&#x27;s new energy drink.

                    <span>FIFA has issued a statement following reports its negotiations with EA have hit an impasse, saying it believes football gaming and esports &quot;must involve more than one party controlling and exploiting all rights&quot;.

                    <span>Even before Apple made its announcement, law enforcement shifted their battle for backdoors to client-side scanning. The idea is that they wouldn’t touch the cryptography, but instead eavesdrop on communications and systems before encryption or after decryption. It’s not a cryptographic backdoor, but it’s still a backdoor — and brings with it all the insecurities of a backdoor.
I’m part of a group of cryptographers that has just published a paper discussing the security risks of such a system. (It’s substantially the same group that wrote a similar paper about ...</span>

                    <span>Metroid Dread has been a critical and commercial success, surpassing all expectations for the return of Nintendo&#x27;s long-dormant franchise, but some of the people involved in its creation have begun airing their disappointment at not being credited for their work - criticism that developer MercurySteam has now addressed.
As reported by Spanish website Vandal, several former MercurySteam employees recently took to the internet to query their names being omitted from Metroid Dread&#x27;s credits, despite being involved in the production of the title. &quot;I would like to sincerely congratulate the Metroid Dread team for putting out such an outstanding game,&quot; wrote 3D artist Roberto Mejías on LinkedIn. &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised of the quality of the game though, since the amount of talent on that team was through the roof.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a rough ride for Paradox Entertainment&#x27;s long-in-the-works RPG sequel Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, and now the publisher has admitted it almost cancelled the project after its original developer Hardsuit Labs was ditched earlier this year.
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, a sequel to developer Troika Games&#x27; much-loved 2004 cult-classic RPG, was announced back in 2019 with a PC and console release expected the following year. Sequel-starved fans were delights at the news, particularly after it was confirmed Troika&#x27;s Brian Mitsoda would assist with writing duties - but first hints of development troubles surfaced later that year when Hardsuit announced the first of several delays.

Now rejigged as a hybrid event, where players can travel to Liverpool&#x27;s Sefton Park or play remotely, this revived gathering is another stepping stone back to &quot;normality&quot; for a game which has been forced to make huge changes over the past 18 months - but which has emerged still as popular as ever.

                    <span>New paper: “This Person (Probably) Exists. Identity Membership Attacks Against GAN Generated Faces.
Abstract: Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved stunning realism, fooling even human observers. Indeed, the popular tongue-in-cheek website http://thispersondoesnotexist.com, taunts users with GAN generated images that seem too real to believe. On the other hand, GANs do leak information about their training data, as evidenced by membership attacks recently demonstrated in the literature. In this work, we challenge the assumption that GAN faces really are novel creations, by constructing a successful membership attack of a new kind. Unlike previous works, our attack can accurately discern samples sharing the same identity as training samples without being the same samples. We demonstrate the interest of our attack across several popular face datasets and GAN training procedures. Notably, we show that even in the presence of significant dataset diversity, an over represented person can pose a privacy concern...</span>

However, &quot;at least two years of talks&quot; are said to have now stalled as the two parties struggle to agree on specifics, with FIFA wanting to increase the cost of its licence by &quot;more than $1 billion for each four-year World Cup cycle&quot; - perhaps eager to capitalise on the exponential growth of Ultimate Team, which made EA $1.62bn in its 2021 financial year, mostly through FIFA.

Games for Windows Live was Microsoft&#x27;s much-hated first attempt at getting Xbox Live-style features on PC, stuffed in a launcher that no one wanted to use, and initially for a $50/year subscription.

                    <span>It’s a matter of going after those with deep pockets. From Wired:
Cloudflare was sued in November 2018 by Mon Cheri Bridals and Maggie Sottero Designs, two wedding dress manufacturers and sellers that alleged Cloudflare was guilty of contributory copyright infringement because it didn’t terminate services for websites that infringed on the dressmakers’ copyrighted designs….
[Judge] Chhabria noted that the dressmakers have been harmed “by the proliferation of counterfeit retailers that sell knock-off dresses using the plaintiffs’ copyrighted images” and that they have “gone after the infringers in a range of actions, but to no avail — every time a website is successfully shut down, a new one takes its place.” Chhabria continued, “In an effort to more effectively stamp out infringement, the plaintiffs now go after a service common to many of the infringers: Cloudflare. The plaintiffs claim that Cloudflare contributes to the underlying copyright infringement by providing infringers with caching, content delivery, and security services. Because a reasonable jury could not — at least on this record — conclude that Cloudflare materially contributes to the underlying copyright infringement, the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is denied and Cloudflare’s motion for summary judgment is granted.”...</span>

                    <span>There&#x27;s some potentially disappointing news for Monster Hunter Rise players; Capcom has revealed that it will be &quot;unable to implement&quot; cross-saves and cross-play between the original Switch version and its upcoming PC port.
Following Capcom&#x27;s recent confirmation that Monster Hunter Rise would launch for PC on 12th January next year, players immediately began questioning how both versions might interact with each other. Some players wondered if they&#x27;d be able to team up with friends playing on a different platform, while others, eager to take advantage of the increased graphical fidelity on PC, asked if Capcom might provide a way to transfer potentially hundreds of hours of time investment from Nintendo&#x27;s console to PC - particularly after an official questionnaire seemed to suggest cross-play and cross-saves were features the publisher was considering.

Riders Republic, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, takes the open-world winter sports action of Steep and expands it out to feature a broader range of activities, encompassing skiing, snowboarding, biking, and wing suits (of the vanilla and jet-powered varieties) in both solo and competitive play - which, in the latter case, includes large-scale competitions for upward of 50 players.

Doktor&#x27;s Curse first emerged as a seasonal treat for Rainbow Six Siege players back in Year 4, but its 5v5 hide-and-seek-style Monster Hunt mode - set across a suitably sinister Frankenstein-themed version of the Theme Park map - has, according to Ubisoft, seen a few tweaks for 2021.

As reported by Grist (via VG247), the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow filed a report in June urging Microsoft to analyse the &quot;environmental and social benefits&quot; of making device repair easier, so that consumers can repair their own tech.

                    <span>It’s not actually banned in the EU yet — the legislative process is much more complicated than that — but it’s a step: a total ban on biometric mass surveillance.
To respect “privacy and human dignity,” MEPs said that EU lawmakers should pass a permanent ban on the automated recognition of individuals in public spaces, saying citizens should only be monitored when suspected of a crime.
The parliament has also called for a ban on the use of private facial recognition databases — such as the controversial AI system created by U.S. startup Clearview...</span>

The Cluster API community is happy to announce the implementation of ClusterClass and Managed Topologies, a new feature that will greatly simplify how you can provision, upgrade, and operate multiple Kubernetes clusters in a declarative way.
A little bit of context…
Before getting into the details, let&#x27;s take a step back and look at the history of Cluster API.
The Cluster API project started three years ago, and the first releases focused on extensibility and implementing a declarative API that allows a seamless experience across infrastructure providers. This was a success with many cloud providers: AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, GCP, Metal3, vSphere and still counting.
With extensibility addressed, the focus shifted to features, like automatic control plane …</span>

                    <span>This is interesting:
A company that is a critical part of the global telecommunications infrastructure used by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and several others around the world such as Vodafone and China Mobile, quietly disclosed that hackers were inside its systems for years, impacting more than 200 of its clients and potentially millions of cellphone users worldwide.

I’ve never heard of the company.
No details about the hack. It could be nothing. It could be a national intelligence service looking for information.</span>

                    <span>Facebook — along with Instagram and WhatsApp — went down globally today. Basically, someone deleted their BGP records, which made their DNS fall apart.
…at approximately 11:39 a.m. ET today (15:39 UTC), someone at Facebook caused an update to be made to the company’s Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) records. BGP is a mechanism by which Internet service providers of the world share information about which providers are responsible for routing Internet traffic to which specific groups of Internet addresses.
In simpler terms, sometime this morning Facebook took away the map telling the world’s computers how to find its various online properties. As a result, when one types Facebook.com into a web browser, the browser has no idea where to find Facebook.com, and so returns an error page...</span>

It divides data into small units called “blocks,” which provide fast and flexible ways to manage data. It’s ideal for local storage and high-performance workloads.

Amid the hack, fewer eyes were on the heart monitors — normally tracked on a large screen at the nurses’ station, in addition to inside the delivery room. Attending obstetrician Katelyn Parnell texted the nurse manager that she would have delivered the baby by caesarean section had she seen the monitor readout. “I need u to help me understand why I was not notified.” In another text, Dr. Parnell wrote: “This was preventable.”...</span>

Why Duplicate Data?
It’s convenient to create a copy of your application with a copy of its state for each team.
For example, you might want a separate database copy to test some significant schema changes
or develop other disruptive operations like bulk insert/delete/update...
Duplicating data takes a lot of time. That’s because you need first to download
all the data from a source block storage provider to compute and then send
it back to a storage provider again. There’s a lot of network traffic and CPU/RAM used in this process.
Hardware acceleration by offloading certain expensive operations to dedicated hardware is
always a huge performance boost. It reduces the time required to complete an operation by orders
of magnitude.
