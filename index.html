                              <span>Blizzard has provided additional details of next week&#x27;s World of Warcraft expansion reveal, confirming the event - previously announced to be airing on Tuesday, 19th April - will commence at 5pm BST/6pm CEST/9am PT/12pm ET.


&quot;World of Warcraft has ignited imaginations through rich storytelling and expansive worlds that prevail throughout the Shadowlands expansion,&quot; Blizzard wrote in an its announcement of today&#x27;s news. &quot;From the hopeless depths of the Maw to the ethereal plains of Zereth Mortis, the Shadowlands delivers a world that challenges heroes to confront the forces that threaten to upset the cosmic balance between life and death. With the story in the Shadowlands coming to a conclusion, the time is at hand to get a sneak peek at what’s next for the heroes of Azeroth.&quot;


As for what maybe next for the long-running MMO, that&#x27;s still somewhat unclear, but Warcraft-focused website Wowhead reports (thanks VGC) that data found in the source code of the official World of Warcraft website suggests the new expansion will be called Dragonflight, with Base, Heroic, and Epic Expansion pre-pruchases seemingly set to become available following next week&#x27;s reveal.

                              <span>Last March, John Wick director Chad Stahelski announced he was working on a movie adaptation of PlayStation samurai adventure Ghost of Tsushima, and now, a little over a year later, a writer for the project has been named.
As reported by Deadline, the new Ghost of Tsushima film adaptation will be penned by Takashi Doscher, who previously wrote and directed romantic sci-fi romance, Only, alongside ESPN documentary A Fighting Chance.
Deadline says the adaptation is still in &quot;early development&quot; and, as such, details remain scarce. However, the publication previously confirmed the project - a collaboration between Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions - will, perhaps unsurprisingly, follow the adventures of game protagonist Jin Sakai. Will there be Hot Spring butt? Only time will tell.

                              <span>Beamdog, the developer perhaps best known for its remasters of Black Isle Studios classics such as Baldur&#x27;s Gate and Planescape: Torment, has unveiled MythForce, a new first-person fantasy rogue-lite inspired by the Saturday morning cartoons of the 80s.
First things first, MythForce looks kind of glorious, doing an admirable job of capturing the ambiance of any number of 80s cartoon favourites, albeit rendered in full 3D. There&#x27;s a definite air of the fondly remembered Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#x27; animated outing about it, for instance (with a little bit of arcade cult-classic Dragon&#x27;s Lair thrown in), which is entirely fitting given Beamdog describes its game as a first-person swords &amp; sorcery adventure.
At MythForce&#x27;s core is a roguelite dungeon-crawling experience that sees up to four co-op players - in the role of either Victoria the valiant Knight, Rico the charming Rogue, Maggie the wise Mage, and Hawkins the deadly Hunter - storming a colourful cartoon castle packed with &quot;treasure, traps, and terrors&quot;. Beamdog is promising to arm players with &quot;legendary weapons and powerful magic&quot; as they attempt to survive the forces of evil within.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s late-game bosses are tough, so what better way to ease the pain of FromSoftware latest epic than by cutting out the middle man and getting one boss to fight another boss on your behalf? We&#x27;ve already had one such showdown before, pitting Malenia against Starcourge Radahn (and his pal Leonard the horse), and the victor of that skirmish is now back, this time taking on Maliketh, the Black Blade.


This latest battle of Elden Ring&#x27;s elite comes courtesy of the Garden of Eyes, the same modder that bought Malenia face to face with Radahn (and that also pitted Bloodborne&#x27;s Lady Maria against Resident Evil Village&#x27;s Lady Dimitrescu), this time promising the &quot;ultimate battle of the Shardbearers&quot; and delivering a whole lot of pyrotechnics as the two fight it out.


Those who&#x27;ve yet to enter the gauntlet of carefully curated misery that makes up Elden Ring&#x27;s final stretch will obviously want to steer clear of Garden of Eyes&#x27; latest head-to-head for obvious spoiler reasons, but those eager to see who reigns victorious this time around simply need to watch the video below.

But wait, there’s more. Not only will new players be welcomed onto the whimsical shores of Snaktooth Island, home to the game’s titular snack and bug hybrids, they will also get their hands on the game’s brand new DLC - The Isle of Bigsnax - on the very same day. For those who have already been playing Bugsnax through PlayStation and Epic, don’t worry. This DLC will also be coming to you at the same time.
In this new DLC, players will be sent to a mysterious new island that has risen up from the depths of the sea. And, as you may have already guessed by its name, here players will come across a new range of supersized bugsnax to capture. You can check out the new trailer for The Isle of Bigsnax below.

You’ll be playing as the purple-haired Shez, who can be male or female (the name can be changed too) and is on a quest to challenge The Ashen Demon.


Shez can choose between three diverging paths based on the houses from Fire Emblem: Three Houses. There’s Scarlet Blaze (Edelgard), Azure Gleam (Dimitri), and Golden Wildfire (Claude), with the path chosen affecting story beats and playable characters.

                              <span>Kristen Hines has been named as the new chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer at embattled publisher Activision Blizzard.


Hines&#x27; appointment comes after a year of damaging headlines which have shone light on Activision Blizzard&#x27;s company culture, including numerous allegations of misconduct and abuse.


Controversial Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick - who remains in place, at least while the company&#x27;s sale to Microsoft is finalised - welcomed Hines&#x27; hiring today.

                              <span>If you feel like you need to see even more of Master Chief&#x27;s derriere after his naked TV debut last week, well I have good news - there is a mod that lets you play Halo Infinite in third person.
The PC mod in question comes from Opulent Halo (via PC Gamer). While the mod is actually a few months old now, many have been recently diving back into Halo Infinite to see how Master Chief (at least his video game form) looks from this new angle. Perhaps Paramount has whetted some appetites?
In a video showing off the mod in action, the creator wrote, &quot;after my novice modding skills in Halo Infinite, I wondered what third person would look like... [spoiler alert] it&#x27;s amazing&quot;.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s worlds are beautiful and desolate. But what if the perspective was shifted?


That&#x27;s exactly what YouTuber Flurdeh has done. Using camera tools by Frans Bouma, they&#x27;ve used a tilt shift lens and isometric view to create a video of the Lands Between from above (thanks PC Gamer).


Though not a full mod, it somewhat reimagines the game as a CRPG, Miyazaki&#x27;s bleak world becoming adorable little dioramas with tiny model enemies shuffling around.

Technically it&#x27;s an Ashe of War called Ground Slam but let’s be real: it&#x27;s a butt stomp.


Spotted by PC Gamer, the streamer has a highlights video of the run up on YouTube that shows the butt slamming route to victory.

                              <span>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have lifted the curtain on their new action-adventure IP, Hell is Us. 
In a joint press release, the companies gave a brief and somewhat haunting synopsis for the game. &quot;The almost total self-sufficiency of the country hides a dark secret: the recent appearance of supernatural creatures resembling ancient headstones and monuments in the region,” the Hell is Us team explained. &quot;The citizens call this phenomenon &#x27;the Calamity&#x27;. Armed with weapons specially forged to fight these monsters, the protagonist must learn how to defeat them and use his equipment wisely.&quot;
To accompany this announcement, a new teaser for Hell is Us was also debuted. This trailer gives off strong Kojima vibes, and shows off the game&#x27;s dystopian country, which is ravaged by civil war. In the words of Ed Nightingale, &quot;It’s like Death Stranding with a sword&quot;. You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

The feature will let anyone on PC, Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S play these games&#x27; campaigns co-operatively online together.


In patch notes, developer 343 Industries said the cross-play had been tested internally - though the company now needed &quot;additional insight from real players with different networking setups&quot;. If you experience issues, you&#x27;re encouraged to report them so 343 can improve the feature further.

                              <span>Nintendo will expand its Kyoto headquarters with a new 10,000 square metre building next door to its existing sites.


The Mario maker has already stumped up the $40m required to purchase the land, on which it will build a new 12-storey office which will expand its notoriously-secretive research and development work.


The new building (red in the diagram below) will sit next to other Nintendo buildings (in pink) and be open by the end of December 2027 (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). Maybe we&#x27;ll have Switch 3 by then?

                              <span>Wingspan, the rather lovely digital adaptation of Stonemaier Games&#x27; equally lovely bird-themed board game, will be ushering a fresh flock of avians into its welcoming habitats from 5th May, come the launch of its first major gameplay DLC, the European Expansion.


Wingspan&#x27;s European Expansion builds on the core game&#x27;s soothing, strategic deck building - which Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese was rather taken with when he first put it through its paces some time back now - by introducing 81 new bird cards from the European area, each accompanied by a recording of its actual sound.


These new birds will bring a range of fresh abilities for use during play - such as the option to steal other players&#x27; food, to place cards on already played cards, and to reset the bird feeder - and you&#x27;ll find a little more in the way of specifics on the official European Expansion website.

                              <span>Capcom has confirmed a sequel to its Arcade Stadium retro compilation is on the way - consisting of 32 more classic titles - after references to a follow-up were spotted on the South Korean game classification website earlier this month.


Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium, as the sequel is known, will follow the same modular release model as its predecessor, consisting of a free base download that includes one game and offering additional titles to purchase from within the collection. Quite why Capcom has decided a sequel is necessary, given the modular, expandable nature of the original, is currently unclear.


&quot;The second Capcom Arcade Stadium title featuring a recreated arcade full of authentic cabinets to play&quot;, is how the publisher describes the sequel in a reference on Steam, promising &quot;a new lineup of masterpieces!&quot;. And in a seperate tweet, it&#x27;s now confirmed that lineup will total 32 arcade classics when it comes to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC this June.

                              <span>New figures show that player numbers for DICE&#x27;s Battlefield 2042 keep on falling, with less than 1000 concurrent users playing via Steam this morning.
A thread on ResetEra revealed that as few as 979 players were shown to be taking part in the game on Steam earlier today, with a peak of 2411 players in the last 24 hours. In comparison, 2018’s Battlefield 5 had a peak of 20,913 players over the same 24-hour period.
These numbers are pretty dire for such a relatively new game, especially one in such a longstanding series, but at this point aren&#x27;t a surprise. After all, in November, Vikki reported that Battlefield 2042 was one of Steam&#x27;s worst-reviewed games of all time, with one user stating the game&#x27;s “issues are endless”.

                              <span>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is off to a superb start in the UK, judging by boxed sales figures from its launch week provided by numbers company GSD. 


TT Games&#x27; epic compilation of all nine films is the UK&#x27;s second-biggest boxed launch of the year so far, behind Pokémon Legends Arceus. 


This means The Skywalker Saga sold more physical copies in its launch week than Elden Ring and Gran Turismo 7, though it&#x27;s worth putting all that in context.

Wander around Mos Espa&#x27;s back alleys and you may encounter Nobot, an odd-looking C-3PO lookalike, who shuffles off into a hovel. Follow him at your peril.
Once inside the area - labelled as &quot;Haunted Hovel&quot; - you&#x27;re treated to a weird one-off moment with Nobot himself - and likely left wondering what the heck just happened.

                              <span>Another day, another Elden Ring speed running record to be left in awe by. And this time, it is a sub-10-minute run. In fact, it is so good, it is actually a sub-nine run, but that didn&#x27;t sound quite as catchy.
This new record was achieved by Distortion 2, who has previously achieved and broken many other Elden Ring speed running records. This included the game&#x27;s first sub-20 run in March.
20 minutes now seems like eons for the streamer, as their new record is an impressive 8 minutes and 56 seconds. This was achieved by using a Zip Glitch, which YouTube commentor Sketchy explains as being performed by &quot;guarding and then walking at a specific time afterward for a specific number of frames. These are frame perfect.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid on PS1 originally had Solid Snake befriending rats.


According to a new video by YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming (narrated by David Hayter no less), game director Hideo Kojima wanted to add more rats into the game, allowing the player to assign them names and raise them as  pets.

Rats were apparently the first life forms Snake encounters in the cold of Alaska, and would play an important role in the game.

Presented by Glen Andrew Brown from PlayStation Studios Creative Arts Music team, the video highlights how composer Bobby Krlic and the team heighten tension the higher Selene climbs in the endless Tower of Sisyphus.


Specifically, every music track has been composed and edited into all twelve musical keys so that every time Selene moves up a floor of the tower the music rises by a semitone.

                              <span>What&#x27;s next for Watch Dogs? While we wait to hear if the London-set Legion will get a full game follow-up, Ubisoft will keep fans busy with a Tokyo-set manga.


The near-future hacktivist saga has so far visited Chicago, San Francisco and a post-Brexit Britain. Here&#x27;s hoping this latest storyline is a little less bleak.


Watch Dogs Tokyo&#x27;s first installment launches tomorrow, 12th April, and involves series&#x27; usual evil megacorp Bloom up to no good again.

                              <span>Elden Ring once had a feature that allowed players to collect dreams from sleeping enemies.


The news comes courtesy of Soulsborne fan, modder and streamer Lance McDonald, who has delved into Elden Ring to discover content cut from the final build.


The network test build of the game from last year included a number of sleeping enemies that were cut from the final game. McDonald uses this version to test out the mechanic.

PSA: the following article contains spoilers for Elden Ring, so if you are still making your way through the Lands Between and have yet to get to Wailing Dunes, this is your cue to find a different article to while away the time with. 
So, to the matter in hand. It turns out you can actually cheese the boss fight with Elden Ring&#x27;s mighty General Radahn. At least, you can cheese it once you get his health whittled down to 50 percent, which is admittedly still a task in its own right.

Eagle-eyed fans have found what they think is the foot of an AT-ST walker - the chicken-legged tanks most famous from their appearance in Return of the Jedi. 


Fittingly, this scene appears to be placed in a forest area - which looks very like the forest moon of Endor. Hey! Maybe this means Kingdom Hearts 4 will get Ewoks too?

                              <span>Andy Greenberg wrote a long article — an excerpt from his new book — on how law enforcement de-anonymized bitcoin transactions to take down a global child porn ring.
Within a few years of Bitcoin’s arrival, academic security researchers — and then companies like Chainalysis — began to tear gaping holes in the masks separating Bitcoin users’ addresses and their real-world identities. They could follow bitcoins on the blockchain as they moved from address to address until they reached one that could be tied to a known identity. In some cases, an investigator could learn someone’s Bitcoin addresses by transacting with them, the way an undercover narcotics agent might conduct a buy-and-bust. In other cases, they could trace a target’s coins to an account at a cryptocurrency exchange where financial regulations required users to prove their identity. A quick subpoena to the exchange from one of Chainalysis’ customers in law enforcement was then enough to strip away any illusion of Bitcoin’s anonymity...</span>

                              <span>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has allegedly enjoyed the greatest opening weekend for any video-game based movie. Ever.

According to Comicbook, the sequel has clocked up an impressive $71 million - that&#x27;s £54.4m - since its premier on Friday; for context, the first Sonic the Hedgehog movie grossed $58m (£44m) on its opening weekend.

Interestingly, this makes it Jim Carrey&#x27;s biggest domestic opener ever, eclipsing 2003&#x27;s Bruce Almighty which grossed $68m during it&#x27;s opening weekend in the States. It also marks Paramount&#x27;s fifth number-one movie of the pandemic, too.

                              <span>Last month&#x27;s patch might not have brought any new content to Cyberpunk 2077, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the development team has given up on &quot;working on stuff&quot; just yet.

In a livestream, CD Projekt Red&#x27;s quest director, Pawel Sasko, confirmed that the team was aware that there is still &quot;work to be done&quot;, and said he was reviewing possible new review quests &quot;daily&quot;. 

&quot;We&#x27;re still improving the game, because we are all aware that there is work to be done&quot;, Sasko said in response to a question in the chat (thanks, Reddit via TheGamer).

With so little to go on right now it&#x27;s unclear if this is a full sequel, a spin-off, or something different altogether, but a recent job advertisement from development studio Unknown Worlds hinted that the studio was seeking a narrative designer to &quot;shape the next game in the Subnautica universe&quot;.

&quot;We&#x27;re seeking a Senior Narrative Designer to work with us to help shape the next game in the Subnautica universe!&quot; developer Unknown Worlds tweeted earlier this week. &quot;Come and join our fully remote studio and let&#x27;s make great games together.&quot;

In the final video released as part of the series&#x27; 20th-anniversary celebrations - dubbed a complication of all trailers revealed during today&#x27;s event - we unexpectedly catch sight of Sora and the statement: &quot;The heart resides within the soul, which in turn is guided by fate to its rightful place&quot;.


But let&#x27;s not talk about it when you can see it for yourself (jump to 4.09 to get straight into the Kingdom Hearts 4 action):

                              <span>Sega has opened up on its secretive &quot;Super Game&quot; initiative, and rather than one game, it looks to be encapsulating to several different games, some of which will include cloud and NFT technology.


In an interview with Sega Japan’s recruitment website and translated by our friends at  VGC, several Sega executives explained that to qualify under the Super Game banner, the new projects must be &quot;multi-platform, global multi-language development, simultaneous worldwide release, and AAA titles&quot;. 


&quot;In other words, you can imagine that the scale of game development will be that of a global blockbuster,&quot; Sega explained.

                              <span>The Australian Classification Board has agreed to review its decision to ban RimWorld from sale.


RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios&#x27; widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, was refused classification in Australia last month, preventing its release and effectively banning it from sale.


As Matt posited at the time it wasn&#x27;t a particularly surprising decision given the Australian Classification Board is notoriously sensitive around certain issues in games, and RimWorld is, after all, a simulation whose incredibly deep systems make drug-fuelled cannibalism an entirely legitimate pastime for colonist.

As reported by Kotaku, PlayStations users have taken to social media on discovering that the hitherto unknown &quot;expiration dates&quot; on their digital games have reportedly expired. 
When trying to re-download the classic version of Chrono Cross, one user reports he received a noticed telling him that his licence to play the game had expired on 31st December, 1969.

&quot;We started shipping Steam Deck just one month ago, and it’s been a huge thrill seeing it out in the wild in players’ hands,&quot; Valve explained in a new blog. An accompanying video can be viewed below, too:


&quot;One of our favourite things about that is finally getting to hear from you about your experience using Steam Deck. This first month has given us a chance to start collecting your feedback as we continue our work to make Deck better in the months and years to come.&quot;

                              <span>Scientists are now debating whether octopuses, squid, and crabs have emotions. Short answer: we don’t know, but can’t rule it out.
There may be a point when humans can no longer assume that crayfish, shrimp, and other invertebrates don’t feel pain and other emotions.
“If they can no longer be considered immune to felt pain, invertebrate experiences will need to become part of our species’ moral landscape,” she says. “But pain is just one morally relevant emotion. Invertebrates such as octopuses may experience other emotions such as curiosity in exploration, affection for individuals, or excitement in anticipation of a future reward.”...</span>

Motherboard requested records mentioning AirTags in a recent eight month period from dozens of the country’s largest police departments. We obtained records from eight police departments.
Of the 150 total police reports mentioning AirTags, in 50 cases women called the police because they started getting notifications that their whereabouts were being tracked by an AirTag they didn’t own. Of those, 25 could identify a man in their lives — ex-partners, husbands, bosses — who they strongly suspected planted the AirTags on their cars in order to follow and harass them. Those women reported that current and former intimate partners­ — the ...</span>

Angels of the Zariman focuses its multitude of new additions around the lore-critical Zariman Ten Zero, an Orokin ship that vanished during a Void-Jump accident. Front and centre of the update is a new instalment in Warframe&#x27;s single-player, story driven Cinematic Quest saga, which this time sets the scene by taking Tenno aboard the Zariman Ten Zero.
Then, once the mission is complete, players will gain access to Chrysalith, a new social hub onboard the Zariman, which introduces a range of new NPC, side missions, and objectives.

                              <span>Tired of those infernal video games, always insisting on being so darned interactive? Well, developer Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology) has you covered in its next horror title The Quarry, which comes with its very own Movie Mode.


Movie Mode, just as it sounds, lets players (or rather viewers, in this instance) watch the entirety of The Quarry&#x27;s summer-camp-flavoured horror in linear, non-interactive fashion - meaning you can simply plop your bot on the sofa, grab your popcorn with two controller-free hands, and soak up its scares with only minimal exertions from yourself.


As detailed in a new IGN preview (thanks PC Gamer), The Quarry&#x27;s Movie Mode will come in three different flavours: Everybody Lives, Everybody Dies, and Director&#x27;s Chair. The first two are pretty self-explanatory, determining whether The Quarry&#x27;s cast members - including the likes of Lance Henriksen, Grace Zabriskie, David Arquette, Ted Raimi, Justice Smith, and Skyler Gisondo - manage to survive their experience at Hackett&#x27;s Quarry summer camp to live another day.

There wasn&#x27;t a lot of news for Fortnite players - at least, not on the surface. 


But eagle-eyed Fishstick fans did subsequently spot something: a brief glimpse at a list of Fortnite file names left open on a strategically-placed Epic Games computer. Zoom in and you can make out references to &quot;Vader&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

                              <span>Criterion&#x27;s new Need for Speed game, which was delayed at the start of last year while the studio assisted the development of Battlefield 2042, will reportedly launch this November, skipping previous game consoles to instead focus on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

 
EA confirmed a new Criterion-developed Need for Speed game was in the works at the tail-end of 2020, slapping it with a vague release window of somewhere between April 2021 and the end of March this year. However, that launch was later delayed to EA&#x27;s fiscal year 2023, with the publisher announcing it had made the decision to move Criterion away from Need for Speed to help DICE &quot;deliver the best [Battlefield] experience possible to our players&quot;.


With Battlefield 2042 now launched, Criterion&#x27;s attention has reportedly returned to Need for Speed, with EA said to be looking to release its long-awaited racer this November. That&#x27;s according to VentureBeat&#x27;s Jeff Grubb who, speaking in the latest episode his GrubbSnax show (thanks WCCF Tech), also claimed this latest series instalment will forego a console release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, instead targeting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

                              <span>Last year, Eidos Montreal released Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy - its own, original take on Marvel&#x27;s oddball spacefaring family - to largely positive reviews which praised its single-player focus, character work and humour. But it remained unclear how well the game had performed commercially, and in February, publisher Square Enix said the title had &quot;undershot expectations&quot;.
Ahead of the BAFTA video game awards last night, I sat down with members of the Guardians of the Galaxy team to discuss the game&#x27;s emotional storytelling, where the series could go next - and some unexpected tussles with racoons. 
But first, the issue of those sales - on which, the team said it had &quot;no regrets&quot;.

Ms. Pac-Man is known for her red bow and boots, but in this new game Pac-Mom has taken over - sporting pink stilettos, hat and gloves. Huh?!


Twitter user Nick C spotted the change and shared it online. Looks like Baby Pac has also been changed.

Last weekend, 343 community director Brian Jarrard said the studio understood some fans were &quot;simply out of patience&quot; with the game&#x27;s various frustrations, and that his team was &quot;certainly not happy to be unable to meet player and community expectations&quot;. However, some of these should be addressed as part of the new season, he added.

As part of the event, various items and minions will be available to collect, as well as an emote for eating an egg.


A picture of the emote shows a cute little Lalafell eating an egg, but the egg still has half the shell on. Which begs the question: how are you meant to eat a boiled egg?

                              <span>Fresh from winning the BAFTA Games award for Performer in a Leading Role, Returnal star Jane Perry discussed the importance of having an older woman &quot;kicking butt&quot;.


Speaking to Eurogamer, the actress behind Returnal main character Selene Vassos and Hitman&#x27;s Diana Burnwood  discussed the tension between being a parent and having a career.



&quot;I think that&#x27;s very unique, and kudos to Housemarque. I think they took a risk, they could have had a younger gal, or they could have had a man, but no,&quot; she said.

                              <span>Paramount&#x27;s Halo TV has revealed yet more of its famously-suited star - and fans remain split on whether this is a good thing. 


After revealing the face of Master Chief (AKA actor Pablo Schreiber) in its premiere episode, the series&#x27; third slice has now unveiled his naked bottom.


Fans have expressed surprise at seeing their suited hero standing in the butt, sorry, buff during the episode screened last night via Paramount+ in the US. (The show remains unavailable to watch in the UK.)

Capcom, via the Resident Evil Twitter account, released four pieces of artwork, each revolving around Nemesis.

The trademark, spotted by Twitter&#x27;s Renka and shared by the ever-watchful Nibel, is being paired with the Tactics Ogre remaster that appeared on last year&#x27;s infamous GeForce Now leak.


Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together first launched on the Super Famicom in Japan in 1995. It later came out on the Sega Saturn and, in the west, the PlayStation. It was remade for PSP in 2010.

The standard Boss Rush lets you fight 12 bosses one after the other, with damage from each carried over to the next. Weapons are fully restored, however.


Your aim here (apart from at the boss&#x27; weakpoints!) is to down each boss as quick as possible. If Samus is downed herself then you&#x27;ll be able retry your current boss fight, but incur a time penalty.

Activision has said it is &quot;prohibited from making new kinds of compensation changes at Raven at this time&quot; due to &quot;legal obligations under the National Labor Relations Act&quot; (thanks, The Verge).

                              <span>MultiVersus gameplay has leaked online and, unsurprisingly, the game looks a lot like Smash Bros.


The near five-minute gameplay clip is live now on vk.com, and looks like it was captured from a recent restricted test, given the black bars that block an identifying watermark from showing on-screen.


We see a raft of characters from the Warner Bros. character pile in action, including Wonder Woman, Batman, Harley Quinn and Velma.

Alongside that Best Game award, Returnal came top in BAFTA&#x27;s Audio Achievement amd Music categories, while Jane Perry scored a win in the Performer in a Leading Role category for her portrayal of Returnal protagonist Selene Vassos.
Returnal wasn&#x27;t the only multi-award winner, however; Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart successfully beat the competition in BAFTA&#x27;s Animation and Technical Achievement categories, while Hazelight Studios&#x27; It Takes Two was named best Multiplayer game and best Original Property.

                              <span>Pirate Legends yearning for some adventure to really test their nautical prowess will finally get their wish from 21st April, when Sea of Thieves launches Legend of the Veil - a brand-new, story driven quest designed exclusively for the piratical cream of the crop.


Rare initially teased Legend of the Veil during its Sea of Thieves&#x27; 2022 roadmap reveal back in January, and with a release date for the adventure now confirmed, the developer has shared more on what players can expect to see come its arrival.


While Sea of Thieves&#x27; existing Pirate-Legend-focused Athena Voyages are little more than a clutch of Trading Company tasks strung together into one lengthy quest, Legend of the Veil is aiming to be rather more ambitious, blending the cinematic presentation of previous Tall Tales adventures - complete with cut-scenes, music, and voice work - with the randomness and replayability of standard voyages.

                              <span>If you hurl yourself over to the Epic Games Store right now, you&#x27;ve a strong selection of freebies to choose from in the form of Rogue Legacy and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, but if your lust for a bargain remains unsated, Epic has more to come, with developer Firaxis&#x27; XCOM 2 now confirmed as next week&#x27;s free game.


XCOM 2 is, of course, a bit of a winner, refining the base-building, alien-annihilating turn-based tactics of its 2012 predecessor (itself a refinement of Julian Gollop&#x27;s classic X-COM series) to create a prettier, tougher, richer game of extraterrestrial slaughter.


As Chris Bratt put it in his 2016 review, &quot;XCOM 2 isn&#x27;t a reworking of the original game...it&#x27;s a genuine response to it... Moment to moment, the thing that makes this astonishing game truly sing is the way in which it&#x27;s managed to respond to the bad habits we picked up last time around. Move faster, it urges. Take more risks. Become a more interesting player.&quot;

                              <span>A new report has highlighted staff concerns at Riot Games, as the League of Legends developer has begun encouraging staff back into its Los Angeles-based office.


Employees told Vice that Riot&#x27;s decision to drop its mask mandate and stop testing for unvaccinated employees put them at risk, as hybrid working with three days in the office per week was being encouraged as the new norm. 


Today&#x27;s report comes just a week after similar criticisms and staff walkouts at Activision, which also has studios in California. Both companies said the changes reflected their state&#x27;s recent relaxation in Covid safety rules - despite rising case numbers due to the Omicron BA2 subvariant.

&quot;Rogue Legacy 2 is finally reaching v1.0 and we couldn&#x27;t be happier with how it turned out,&quot; the developer wrote today. 
&quot;Our goal for Rogue Legacy 2 was always to make &#x27;Rogue Legacy 3&#x27; because we didn’t want to settle for just more.  It had to stay true to the original, but also stand on its own as something new.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re celebrating the return of Monkey Island and Max Payne!
A brilliant April Fool&#x27;s announcement from Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert has become a very-real revival for everyone&#x27;s favourite pirate Guybrush Threepwood. Meanwhile, Grand Theft Auto maker Rockstar is lending the Max Payne franchise back to Control developer Remedy.
Chatting with me about all this - and what we&#x27;d like to see revived next - are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy. We discuss playing as a digital Sam Lake, mangle poor Guybrush&#x27;s name, and hum the F-Zero theme tune.

                              <span>Lego and Fortnite maker Epic Games have today announced a &quot;long-term partnership to shape the future of the metaverse&quot; with a focus on building a safe space for young players.


&quot;The family-friendly digital experience will give kids access to tools that will empower them to become confident creators and deliver amazing play opportunities in a safe and positive space,&quot; the pair announced in a joint statement today.


Details are thin on the ground, but it feels like a major commitment for Lego&#x27;s digital future, and a huge win for Epic Games to be entrusted with the notoriously child-safe brand.

Around a decade ago, plans were in place for director Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill to adapt Eidos Montreal&#x27;s popular cyberpunk shooter into a film. But it wasn&#x27;t to be.


Derrickson and Cargill were snapped up by Marvel to make Doctor Strange, and without the duo onboard, production company CBS Films lost interest and moved on.

                              <span>AC Milan will put the awful eFootball logo on its training kit, Konami has announced.

The logo, which looks like a rip-off of the euro sign, will be on the famous Italian club&#x27;s training gear from the beginning of next season.


The players wear the training kit during sessions at the Milanello Sports Centre and before every fixture in domestic and international competitions. They of course wear the proper AC Milan kit while they&#x27;re playing matches. Konami hasn&#x27;t got its eFootball logo on that - yet.

                              <span>Overwatch character Zarya has been quietly edited to remove a &quot;Z&quot; logo on her character model. 
Developer Blizzard has not yet commented on the change, though fans have spotted the &quot;Z&quot; has now disappeared in the game&#x27;s most recent update (thanks, PC Gamer).
It&#x27;s not hard to guess why this change has occured now. The &quot;Z&quot; symbol has recently become co-opted by Putin-supporting Russian citizens and emblazoned on military vehicles currently involved in the country&#x27;s devastating invasion of Ukraine.

As reported by Kotaku, the next game in the series is codenamed OVER and was originally leaked by Nvidia. Kotaku sources claim it has already been in development for over a year and could be released in fiscal year 2023. 


Also reported is that free-to-play live-service shooter Ghost Recon Frontline is undergoing a reset following negative feedback from an internal playtest this year. It&#x27;s unlikely to launch soon.

                              <span>When working your way through Moreau’s watery swamp pit in Resident Evil Village, players were reportedly once set to encounter a range of new creatures, including mermaids. But as is to be expected from a Resident Evil game, these mermaids were not going to be the Disney princess versions akin to the likes of Ariel and her family. Rather, they were going to a (literal) monstrous pain for Ethan Winters and players.
Reliable Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem, who has a record of insider knowledge on the series&#x27; development, has shared more details on Moreau’s area within the game, as well as the enemies players would encounter there. When discussing the mermaid like enemies that were ultimately cut from the final release, Dusk Golem revealed:
&quot;In the water they could swim for you quickly if [they] spotted you, and you had to get to patches of land or kill them successfully before they reached you.

                              <span>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has only been out a couple of days, but players are already getting creative with some of its quirks. 


For example, you can&#x27;t kill children in the game - and players have found that by chaining lightsaber attacks against these invulnerable younglings, you can essentially levitate and hover to places you&#x27;d normally struggle to reach. 


Specifically, people are beating up little Episode 1-era Anakin Skywalker, who will simply glow red from repeated lightsaber damage. (Normally, whacking your party members with lightsabers sends them tumbling apart into their Lego components.)

                              <span>Remedy has announced plans to remake Max Payne 1 and 2 after agreeing a deal with original publisher Rockstar.


The neo-noir action games, known for their bullet-time gameplay, return as a single title for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, and are built with Remedy’s own Northlight game engine.


According to Remedy, Rockstar is footing the bill for development. The studio behind Alan Wake and Control said the remake&#x27;s development budget is &quot;in line with a typical Remedy AAA-production&quot;.

                              <span>The first big fix for Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s launch issues – chiefly its grim grind made all the more unpalatable by the presence of microtransactions – is now live, boosting payouts for campaign and online events and making some other welcome changes along the way. 
New events have been introduced, with big races at Le Mans, Sardegna and Tokyo Expressway slotting in alongside other tweaked races towards the end of the campaign that now all deliver bigger payouts. There are new 1 hour endurance events available once you&#x27;ve reached Collector Level 23 – all coming under &#x27;The Human Comedy&#x27; banner, which is rather apt for the discipline – while online events will also now offer bigger payouts. Elsewhere the in-game credit cap has been lifted and more legendary cars will be listed in the auction house at any one time. 
And there&#x27;s more! Off-road physics, which were a bit waywards, have now been grounded, some graphical tweaks have taken place and plenty more besides – you can see the full rundown of what&#x27;s new in Gran Turismo 7 version 1.11 in the extensive patchnotes.

The Justice Department today announced a court-authorized operation, conducted in March 2022, to disrupt a two-tiered global botnet of thousands of infected network hardware devices under the control of a threat actor known to security researchers as Sandworm, which the U.S. government has previously attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (the GRU). The operation copied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that Sandworm used for command and control (C2) of the underlying botnet. Although the operation did not involve access to the Sandworm malware on the thousands of underlying victim devices worldwide, referred to as “bots,” the disabling of the C2 mechanism severed those bots from the Sandworm C2 devices’ control. ...</span>

As Kubernetes evolves, features and APIs are regularly revisited and removed. New features may offer
an alternative or improved approach to solving existing problems, motivating the team to remove the
old approach. Old APIs are first deprecated and then removed according to the Kubernetes Deprecation Policy.
We want to make sure you are aware of the changes coming in the Kubernetes 1.24 release. The release will
deprecate several (beta) APIs in favor of stable versions of the same APIs. The major change coming
in the Kubernetes 1.24 release is the removal of Dockershim. This is discussed
below and will be explored in more depth at release time. For an early look at the changes coming in Kubernetes 1.24, take a look at the in-progress CHANGELOG.

                              <span>Following on from a patch released only last week, Guerrilla has released yet another update for Horizon Forbidden West today.
This update continues to add improvements to the game, covering everything from the UI to the machines that roam through Horizon&#x27;s futuristic yet primal world. 
An issue with Melee Pits progression has been resolved with this patch, as have the multiple instances of machines getting stuck outside of the player’s reach during Side Quest objectives, thus conditionally blocking progression.

                              <span>Pokémon Go&#x27;s much-maligned Mega Evolution system is getting an overhaul, according to several recent datamines of in-game files. 


The way Pokémon Go has handled Mega Evolution - a popular mechanic from the monster franchise&#x27;s main games - has been criticised since its arrival in August 2020, although it has been improved over time. 


These upcoming potential changes - which, to be clear, are yet to be finalised and announced by developer Niantic - seem like they&#x27;ll go a lot further to address recurrent gripes and encourage more regular Mega Evolution as part of daily play.

In a livestream interview with composing software Reason Studios, Stardew creator Eric Barone showed off some of the music from the forthcoming game (thanks PC Gamer). 


That included a track called &quot;beeboss&quot;, complete with buzzing melodies.

eFootball - the new name for PES - arrived in a disastrous state late last year, despite Konami warning players it would arrive in extremely limited form akin to a demo. 


Konami insisted the game would evolve over time, but players have been left waiting months for this v1.0.0 update to arrive. In the meantime, eFootball&#x27;s mobile spin-off was postponed, and the game&#x27;s controversial premium player pack was pulled from sale.

Set for release in early 2022 when it was announced last year, it would have been the first new game in Sega&#x27;s strategy series since 2009.


It was being developed by Hive, a Japanese subsidiary of Korean developer Vespa (the studio behind mobile role-player King&#x27;s Raid) but development has ceased due to development costs and time required, according to Touch Arcade.

                              <span>New release Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has set fresh records for TT Games&#x27; Lego series on Steam. 


While not enough to trouble the likes of perenial Steam favourites, or rival the enormous Steam launch of Elden Ring, it is worth pointing out how good a launch Lego Star Wars has had compared to other games in the series.


The Skywalker Saga hit an 82,445 player peak on its launch day,  compared to numbers around the ~5000 player mark for Marvel Super Heroes, The Hobbit, Ninjago and Lord of the Rings (thanks, BenjiSales).

The online tactical shooter first launched in October 2019 and was poorly received, though has been kept fresh with new content themed around Splinter Cell and Terminator, alongside more standard game improvements. 
But more recently, it has become best known as the staging ground for Ubisoft Quartz, the company&#x27;s highly-controversial experiment in NFTs.

                              <span>Aloy can now instantly pick up resources in Horizon Forbidden West, after Guerrilla quietly added in the new feature.


Available as a toggle in the options, players can now turn off pickup animations so that Aloy instantly grabs nearby resources, speeding up the flow of exploration considerably.


It seems the feature was added in the most recent patch, though it&#x27;s strangely missing from the patch notes.

                              <span>A new behind the scenes video for Starfield has been revealed, with robot companion VASCO taking centre stage.
In this video, shared by IGN, Starfield lead artist Istvan Pely introduces us all to one of his &quot;favourite campanions in the game&quot;.
Here, Pely states VASCO is a &quot;reliable companion that an intrepid explorer like yourself can depend on&quot;.

                              <span>After its game-changing reveal on PlayStation 5 and following a period of early access, Unreal Engine 5 is finally available for general download. In combination with the release, Epic is releasing a cut-down, Keanu-free rendition of the remarkable The Matrix Awakens demo alongside a sample game project to experiment with, called Lyra. UE5&#x27;s release takes centre stage in today&#x27;s State of Unreal virtual event, and we&#x27;re told to expect a range of tech deep dives surrounding the technology alongside the launch of the engine itself.


UE5 takes the established Unreal Engine 4.27 and adds full support for a number of key next generation technologies. We&#x27;ve already seen these in action, of course. Lumen is Epic&#x27;s take on a fully real-time global illumination solution, eliminating the need to rely on static, pre-calculated &#x27;baked&#x27; lighting, leaning into hardware accelerated ray tracing where appropriate. Nanite is UE5&#x27;s virtualised micro-polygon technology, delivering incredibly granular detail from assets of motion picture quality and the elimination of geometry &#x27;pop-in&#x27;. 


The demands of these systems are such that native rendering at 4K resolution is not feasible on today&#x27;s game consoles and that ties into another key feature: Temporal Super Resolution. Recently seen for the first time in a non-UE5 title – Ghostwire: Tokyo – TSR is the best software-based temporal upscaling solution we&#x27;ve seen to date. In upscaling from a native 1080p to 4K – a 2x resolution boost on both axes – the quality is comparable (if not quite as good as) Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS.

                              <span>Hypnospace Outlaw is getting a sequel. Well, a spiritual sequel called Dreamsettler. But it&#x27;s almost exactly the same thing: a detective game set in an old version of the internet, which you&#x27;ll trawl to uncover a mystery.
And there&#x27;s more: another new game called Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer. It&#x27;s more of an accompaniment or spin-off, and it&#x27;s fictitiously made by Hypnospace Outlaw character Zane! Though developer Tendershoot and publisher No More Robots are so committed to this fiction they&#x27;ll even apparently roleplay as Zane when answering questions on Steam forums and so on.
The Slayer X game is like retro Doom, or Duke Nukem 3D - a game in that vein. It&#x27;s pixelated and filled with trashy gore and ridiculous weaponry. And if you know the story of Hypnospace Outlaw, you&#x27;ll know Zane is out for revenge. He apparently found an old CD-ROM with the game on and decided to brush it up for a noughties audience.

                              <span>Amazon Games has outlined its April and May content plan for Lost Ark, including two new playable classes.


Coming in April is the Glaivier, a new female martial artist advanced class who weaves together attacks with a spear and glaive depending on the two stances she uses: Focus and Flurry.


&quot;“&quot;While certain builds may focus your attention onto one of these weapons, an effective Glaivier can maximize their potential by creating balance between the two stances, building up energy in one stance which grants an impactful stat-boost when swapping to the other,&quot;”&quot; reads the blog post.

Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla heroine Eivor will become available to purchase later this week with a bundle of themed items, alongside a general launch for the game&#x27;s previously-released Ezio promotional skin.


Both Ezio and Eivor will make their item shop debuts upon the store&#x27;s refresh on Thursday night (that&#x27;s 1am Friday here in the UK).

In this new game, players will be pitted against each other in 5v5 matches, or &quot;Attack vs Defence&quot;. As the name suggests, attackers will have to gain intel on their enemy by deploying drones and breaching &quot;walls, floors and ceilings&quot;. Meanwhile, those on the defence team will have to ensure their intel is secure with the use of spy cameras and traps.
You can check out Rainbow Six Mobile&#x27;s reveal trailer below.

The latest entry in the teen-with-special-powers narrative adventure series first launched last summer, and was warmly received. It&#x27;s &quot;a beautiful return to small-town mystery and young adult drama,&quot; I wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Life is Strange: True Colors review.


True Colors is just one of Microsoft&#x27;s latest list of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass through the first half of April. Also on the cards are sports games Cricket 22 and MLB The Show 22, plus gothic fairytale Lost in Random and cybernoir point-and-click adventure Chinatown Detective Agency.

Now, these icons have been refreshed for April, with NSO users now able to get their hands on a different selection of Animal Crossing themed icons (all based around islanders with April birthdays) as well as ones from Splatoon 2.

&quot;Starting today we&#x27;re ramping up Steam Deck shipments and will be sending more order availability emails every week. Sometimes even twice a week!&quot;

                              <span>Concept art for Overwatch 2 has raised the possibility that Blizzard&#x27;s hero shooter sequel will include a battle pass. 


A concept for the game&#x27;s main menu, designed by Blizzard senior UI artist Jayson Kirby, has popped up online via Artstation (as spotted by Attack of the Fanboy).


The image shows a new look for the game&#x27;s homepage, complete with familiar options to access its hero roster, shop and challenges - but also a separate battle pass option.

                              <span>Following confusion over the project&#x27;s future, the director of upcoming PS5 game Abandoned has spoken out about why developer Blue Box deleted various tweets about the game, the status of the game&#x27;s prologue and his own &quot;heartbreak&quot; about the situation now surrounding the game&#x27;s release.
Speaking to IGN, Hasan Kahraman of Blue Box Game Studios said the developer had removed older tweets about the game in a bid to keep information surrounding Abandoned up to date. &quot;Basically, the tweets were deleted because some of the concept has changed, and I figured maybe just deleting the tweet and then tweeting more relevant information would be a better idea - which was actually not a good idea,&quot; Kahraman said.
&quot;I have learned now just to keep them. Even if the information or concept changed, just keep the older information because people eventually will see for themselves what the difference is and then see what&#x27;s more actual.&quot;

                              <span>Activision Blizzard employees have taken part in a planned strike in protest at the company&#x27;s recent decision to drop its requirement that in-office staff are vaccinated.


Last week, the embattled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty maker announced it would no longer require office-based staff to have had Covid jabs, while encouraging a gradual return to in-person working over the coming months.


The decision, announced in an email by Activision Blizzard exec Brian Bulatao, was immediately criticised by staff who said it risked employees who may be immunocompromised or who lived with others who are, and was poorly timed as the US faces up to Covid&#x27;s current Omicron BA2 subvariant.

                              <span>Elden Ring boss Radahn was accidentally nerfed in a patch, but now he&#x27;s back to full strength.


FromSoftware&#x27;s previous patch for the game added new features like NPC icons and quests, as well as balance changes. But nerfing the infamous boss Starscourge Radahn was unintentional.


Now a new patch is available that fixes &quot;a bug in the balance adjustment of the boss Starscourge Radahn in update 1.03, in which the power of some attacks was unintentionally reduced&quot;.

Virtually all major technology companies serving large numbers of users online have departments that routinely review and process such requests, which are typically granted as long as the proper documents are provided and the request appears to come from an email address connected to an actual police department domain name.
But in certain circumstances ­– such as a case involving imminent harm or death –­ an investigating authority may make what’s known as an Emergency Data Request (EDR), which largely bypasses any official review and does not require the requestor to supply any court-approved documents...</span>

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper, the really promising new game by In Other Waters developer Jump Over the Age, will be released 5th May.

Excitingly, it&#x27;ll be available day-one on Xbox Game Pass, on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. It&#x27;ll also be available on PC from a number of stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, Humble), and - this just in - Nintendo Switch. There&#x27;s no PlayStation version, sadly.

I played a demo of Citizen Sleeper recently and was impressed. It&#x27;s a mash-up of a board game and an RPG. There&#x27;s a lot of descriptive text and dialogue choices, as you&#x27;d get in an RPG, and there&#x27;s levelling up and skills and that kind of thing. But it all plays out in a turn-based, board game kind of way, and quite a lot of what you can do depends on dice you roll at the beginning of each turn. It takes a bit of getting used to.

Monkey Island co-creator Ron Gilbert is spearheading the project, alongside fellow co-creator Dave Grossman. Dominic Armato will also return as the fan-favourite voice of Guybrush Threepwood.
To accompany this announcement, a new teaser was also revealed, with a tenuous release date set for some time this year.

Gex Jr. jumps from screen to popcorn machine and on to yet another screen (one of which appears to show Gex from Crystal Dynamics’ original games), all while chugging down cans of fizzy soda and making some pretty dated references.

This patch will finally address numerous bugs present in the game, including an issue where the game stopped progressing at the rankings screen at the end of a race or while matchmaking for the next race. 
It will also attend to an issue where finishing in fourth place or higher was treated as being eliminated due to lag.

First up there’s Twitch streamer Seki, who not only completed the game in under three hours - an impressive feat alone - but did so without taking any damage.


Seki’s run was the world’s first to do so - while streamer GinoMachino managed a no hit run on 13th March, Seki took no damage at all. That means completing the whole game without taking fall or poison damage, let alone getting hit.

                              <span>343 Industries has acknowledged the frustrations of its Halo Infinite community, however the team hopes the upcoming arrival of Season Two will fix some of the ongoing issues. 
343 community director Brian Jarrard took to Reddit over the weekend, where he revealed the Halo Infinite team is &quot;certainly not happy to be unable to meet player and community expectations&quot;.
He also admitted, &quot;it&#x27;s a difficult situation that&#x27;s going to take the team time to work through&quot;.

                              <span>A new mode for The Division 2 sees players fighting to take back control of a nuclear power station which has been captured by enemy forces. 


Ubisoft has not trumpeted the arrival of the new eight-player offering, dubbed Countdown, and it&#x27;s easy to see why. The new mode has launched while the very real fight for control of Chernobyl power station has been in the headlines, during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 


Of course, the mode has been in development for some time - and was not created in response to the real-world crisis. The timing, however, is unforunate.

As previously reported, arrangers Charlie Rosen and Jake Silverman were nominated for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella for their Big Band arrangement of Meta Knight&#x27;s Revenge from Kirby Superstar.


It means Nintendo’s little pink ball - or at least, Rosen and Silverman - is only the second ever video game winner at the awards.

                              <span>Sony has quietly removed an offer for PS Now in the wake of the announcement for its revamped PS Plus subscription.



An offer was previously available to purchase a year’s subscription to streaming service PS Now for $59.99 (on the US PSN). This was a particularly good deal as existing PS Now subscribers will automatically transfer to the Premium tier of the new PS Plus worth $119.99 a year.


However, PS Now can currently only be purchased on a monthly basis (£8.99). Once the new PS Plus launches, PS Now will no longer be available as a standalone product so players will move to the equivalent tier at £13.49 monthly.

Boxed versions of GTA5 are retailing at £24.99 from outlets such as GAME in the UK (click here for the PS5 version and here for the Xbox Series X version). 
Unless you particularly want to have a boxed version of the game to add to your collection, however, it is worth noting that digital copies of GTA5 are considerably cheaper.

Now, players can choose whether they want to play classic Solos, Duos, Trios or Squads playlists with building - or the option of No Builds Solos, Duos, Trios or Squads, as the game has offered over the past couple of weeks. 


In those No Build modes, the game retains the Overshield mechanic introduced at the beginning of the season. But this is gone if you choose to play with building back re-enabled.

In case you’re wondering, no, that is not normal in the security community. While experts tell me that the concept of a “responsible disclosure timeline” is a little outdated and heavily depends on the situation, we’re generally measuring in days, not years. “The majority of researchers have policies where if they make a good faith effort to reach a vendor and don’t get a response, that they publicly disclose in 30 days,” Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and former chief security officer at Facebook, tells me...</span>

The company said its move reflected similar changes made by other businesses across the US, in a company-wide email from exec Brian Bulatao, shared by ABK Worker Alliance&#x27;s Jessica Gonzalez (thanks, Kotaku).
Bulatao&#x27;s email began by suggesting conditions in the US were currently improving - despite the rising tide of new cases brought by the increasingly-dominant Omicron BA.2 subvariant, and the relatively low percentage of US citizens protected by a Covid booster dose.

By snippet, I really do mean snippet. It was a &quot;blink and you will miss it&quot; situation. However, after playing it coy throughout Breath of the Wild 2&#x27;s most recent trailer, this delay announcement did finally reveal the front of Link, and more of his corrupted arm (with said corruption looking like it is also starting to make its way across Link&#x27;s chest).
It also showed the Master Sword looking a tad worse for wear. In fact, it looked downright ruined.

                              <span>A group of US senators has expressed concern at the possibility of a windfall payout for controversial Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick, as part of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed acquisition of his company. 
Four politicians, including former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, signed a letter to the Federal Trade Commission alerting it to the issue, The Wall St Journal has reported. 
The FTC is currently examining the details of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68bn deal to buy Activision Blizzard, which is expected to be finalised next year.

Throughout the game, instructions from characters, signposts, and the in-game manual are written in a made-up runic language. Players aren&#x27;t required to translate it; instead it adds an air of mystery to the foxy adventure and forces players to analyse visual clues instead.

Even so, it retains Skylines&#x27; core strategic city planning, giving players the tools to construct their metropolis piece by piece - from roads to neighbourhoods to districts - while juggling its economy, emergency services, and education and entertainment needs along the week.

                              <span>A new report has shed light behind the scenes of State of Decay 3, the upcoming open world zombie game from the Undead Labs.
Details published by Kotaku include allegations of sexism and mismanagement at the Microsoft-owned studio, and paint a picture of a game project which is still struggling to get off the ground years after its official reveal.
State of Decay 3 began pre-production in late 2018, though developers at Undead Labs were reportedly poorly-managed and the project took several team re-organisations to get off the ground. Staff have claimed the game&#x27;s public announcement in 2020 was too early, and at that point Undead Labs &quot;didn&#x27;t even know what it was&quot;.

The original Azure Striker Gunvolt, which launched to a solid reception on 3DS back in 2014, took its retro-infused cue from Capcom&#x27;s beloved Mega Man series, with Inti Creates having previously worked on Mega Man Zero, ZX, 9, and 10 (Gunvolt was also executive produced by Mega Man&#x27;s Keiji Inafune). A sequel arrived two years later, and both games can now be played on Switch via the Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack, if you&#x27;re curious to learn more.
All of which brings us to Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 which, having initially been announced back in 2020, is now almost ready to for its Switch debut. The big change for this new outings is new playable character Kirin, bringing a new play-style as she battles foes using a combination of her speedy sword, throwable talismans, and Arc Chain ability, enabling her to close gaps instantly.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t Starve Together, developer Klei Entertainment&#x27;s co-operative multiplayer twist on its acclaimed survival adventure, will be making its way to Switch on 12th April.
If you&#x27;ve already played Don&#x27;t Starve, you&#x27;ll be right at home with Together; it takes the original&#x27;s deliciously dark survival conceit - in which you awake in an expansive, wonderfully twisted world and must forage, maim, eat, and build in order to survive long enough to orchestrate an escape - but enables you to do it all with friends in tow.
There are three different modes available - Survival (in which players become revivable ghosts on death), the resurrection-free Wilderness, and a more leisurely Endless mode - all incorporating features from the original Don&#x27;t Stare, its Reign of Giants expansion, plus elements from the Hamlet and Shipwrecked DLCs.

                              <span>Developer WashBear Studio&#x27;s relentlessly adorable (and highly enjoyable) dinosaur park management sim Parkasaurus will be welcoming a host of aquatic exhibits for the very first time come the arrival of its newly announced Sea Monsters expansion &quot;soon&quot;.
Parkasaurus, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, takes obvious inspiration from the likes of Theme Park and DinoPark Tycoon, giving players all the tools they need to build and staff their very own dino-flavoured tourist attraction. Crucially, that involves providing the perfect habitats for a wide variety of adorable prehistoric creatures, with each dinosaur having specific terrain, water, food, privacy, and scenery requirements.
And once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s time to throw open the doors for an endless procession of guests, and they in turn have their own needs to be fulfilled - from places to eat to places to poop - if they&#x27;re going to continue to spend, spend, spend. And hopefully not get eaten.

&quot;The previous Minecraft Preview build available to Xbox Insiders inadvertently included prototype code for raytracing support on Xbox consoles,&quot; Microsoft said in a message posted to the official Minecraft Twitter account.
It added the &quot;early prototype code&quot; has now been removed from Minecraft Preview and that its recent appearance &quot;doesn&#x27;t signal near future plans to bring raytracing support to consoles.&quot;

E3&#x27;s 2022 started to look shaky in January, when show organiser the ESA confirmed it wouldn&#x27;t be holding a physical event this year due to potential risks from covid - though several journalists subsequently suggested it had actually been scrapped before Christmas - marking the third year in a row E3&#x27;s in-person component has been cancelled.
Instead, there were reports the Entertainment Software Association was once again planning a digital offering in place of this year&#x27;s live show - in a similar manner to last year&#x27;s virtual event - but the organisation has now confirmed E3 will be skipping 2022 entirely.

                              <span>Developer Heart Machine has unveiled Hyper Light Breaker, a fully 3D rogue-lite spin on its acclaimed 2016 action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter that&#x27;s coming to PC early next year.
While Hyper Light Drifter served up a tautly designed single-player adventure blending rich exploration with challenging melee combat in a strikingly presented top-down, 2D world, Hyper Light Breaker looks like a very different take on the same universe.
It all unfolds in the Overgrowth, a new &quot;vast, ever-changing&quot; (and fully 3D) world consisting of massive, open biomes and deep labyrinths - which players can navigate using the likes of wall-dashing, hoverboarding, and gliding. Here, they&#x27;ll be able to &quot;defeat brutal monsters, create new builds, survive the mysterious Crowns and overthrow the almighty Abyss King.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly set to plug a gap in its Game Pass line-up by launching a new family plan, enabling five users to access the service using one subscription, later this year.
That&#x27;s according to Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden, who, citing &quot;trusted sources familiar with with Microsoft&#x27;s efforts&quot;, reports the family plan has been in the works for some time as Microsoft navigated issues around royalty distribution and third-party licenses. Those kinks are presumably close to being ironed out now, however, with Corden suggesting an official unveiling may happen relatively soon. 
As for what the family plan might offer, it&#x27;ll reportedly enable five users in the same country to access Game Pass&#x27; entire library using a single membership, with the cost said to be &quot;far cheaper&quot; than paying for five individual subscriptions.

&quot;Aurora has lost her way and awoken in a strange, dangerous new land,&quot; explains developer ArtPlay in a new Kickstarter update. &quot;Armed with the Sword of Matildis and accompanied by the loyal Igniculus, she must find a way to escape.&quot;
Upon downloading today&#x27;s free 1.30 update, players can take Child of Light protagonist Aurora (who joins existing playable characters Miriam and Zangetsu, plus &quot;bonus&quot; character Bloodless) on a gothic romp through Bloodstained&#x27;s familiar castle, making use of her sword, companion Igniculus - who can slow opponents or heal Aurora - and her directional Light Ray skill, which damages any enemies caught in its beam.

                              <span>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, developer Sharkmob&#x27;s free-to-play battle royale spin on the long-running RPG series, is getting its full PlayStation 5 and PC launch on 27th April.
Bloodhunt (not to be confused with Big Bad Wolf Studio&#x27;s upcoming  RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong, Paradox Interactive&#x27;s troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, or indeed 2019 visual novel Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York) was announced toward the end of 2020 and had a limited Steam early access run the following year.
It is, all in all, pretty much exactly what it sounds like, casting participants - either playing solo or in a team of three - as vampires and setting them loose across the rain-soaked, moon-drenched streets and rooftops of Prague. All players have access to basic vampire trickery such as the ability to scramble up walls, but the characters they choose (from one of several vampire clans) inform the additional supernatural powers they&#x27;re able to deploy. Oh, and there are lots and lots of guns to loot too, if you&#x27;d just rather just do the shooty thing.

                              <span>A choreographer is suing Epic Games over dance moves included in an old Fortnite emote. 
Kyle Hanagami, a choreographer who has worked with Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and J-Lo, filed suit against Epic regarding the &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; emote, which was released within Fortnite back in August 2020. 
Lawyers for Hanagami have said the emote uses copyrighted dance moves from a 2017 video set to Charlie Puth&#x27;s &quot;How Long&quot; (thanks, Kotaku) without credit or compensation.

                              <span>Microsoft has reinstated the ability for Xbox users to share game screenshots and videos directly to Twitter in response to feedback it received after removing the feature from console dashboards in an Xbox Insider build earlier this month.
While the direct Twitter sharing feature never got the chop in the live build of the Xbox dashboard - meaning the impact of its removal was limited - there were certainly grumbles from Insider testers after they were forced to grapple with more cumbersome methods of image and video sharing, requiring them to first upload clips to their phones, following the changes made in Microsoft&#x27;s previous Insider build.
Now, however, in response Insider feedback, direct Twitter sharing has returned in Microsoft&#x27;s last Beta Ring build. &quot;Thanks for your feedback on the Twitter share feature change we flighted in 2204,&quot; Xbox Insider program lead Brad Rosetti wrote in a tweet. &quot;That change is being reverted to the previous behaviour from today in this new build&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft has elected to reinstate the ability for Xbox users to share game screenshots and videos directly to Twitter in response to feedback it received after removing the feature from console dashboards in an Xbox Insider build earlier this month.
While the direct Twitter sharing feature never got the chop in the live build of the Xbox dashboard - meaning the impact of its removal was limited - there were certainly grumbles from Insider testers after they were forced to grapple with more cumbersome methods of image and video sharing, requiring them to first upload clips to their phones, following the changes made in Microsoft&#x27;s previous Insider build.

Break the Bank is all about the gold, and its centrepiece is an opulent depository for unimaginable riches known as The Bank. Mechanically, this is quite a bit different from other biomes so far added to developer Motion Twin&#x27;s acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer, given that its entrance - a mysterious giant chest - will appear at random during a run.
Provided you&#x27;ve first completed its sole unlock criteria - reach the Hand of the King once - the chest can appear in any of Dead Cells&#x27; post-biome transition stages, and players will need to decide right then and there if they want to open it and delve into The Bank. If they decide yes, The Bank will replace the next biome along the path (it won&#x27;t appear before a boss), but should they choose to forego its temptations, it won&#x27;t reappear on the same run.

                              <span>Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe - the remake of the remake of everybody&#x27;s favourite comedic rumination on video game agency - finally has a release date and will, after a number of not-insignificant delays, be heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 27th April.
Stanley Parable&#x27;s Ultra Deluxe edition was first announced back in 2018, with developers Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows (the respective studios of original Stanley Parable creator Davey Wreden and William Pugh, who co-designed the 2013 remake of the 2011 original) aiming to launch the following year. 2020 bought a second delay, and a hat-trick was achieved in 2021 - leaving many to ponder if the whole thing mightn&#x27;t actually be some sort of mega-meta ruse and that the game didn&#x27;t, and would never, exist.
Happy days are now here, however, with Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows having finally given the Ultra Deluxe edition a 27th April release date - 4/27, of course, being the number on Stanley&#x27;s near-iconic office door. And if that&#x27;s not appropriately self-referential enough for you, the announcement is accompanied by a recreation of the Stanley Parable&#x27;s 2013 trailer - only this time the player goes left.

                              <span>UPDATE 30/3/22: Sony has now formally unveiled April&#x27;s PlayStation Plus games line-up and, unsurprisingly given the veracity of previous PlayStation Plus leaks from French forum Dealabs, the official list remains unchanged.
That means, from 5th April, PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to download and play acclaimed card-battler Slay the Spire (PS4), Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends (PS4 &amp; PS5), and SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated (PS4).
Sony has also warned PlayStation 5 owners that Persona 5 is being removed from its PlayStation Plus Collection on 11th May, meaning they should download it soon while the chance remains.

                              <span>Today marks the launch of Intel&#x27;s Arc A-series graphics family, the company&#x27;s first discrete graphics cards to go head to head against industry titans AMD and Nvidia. To start, Team Blue is building its Arc GPUs for laptops, with entry-level Arc 3 models debuting now in laptops from $899. Higher-powered models called Arc 5 and Arc 7 are set to arrive early this summer, in higher-end machines. The company also teased its first desktop Arc graphics card at the very end of its presentation, showing off a much beefier design than the DG1 card shipped to developers last year. Here&#x27;s what you need to know from Intel&#x27;s Arc announcements.
First of all, the Arc series of graphics cards ought to be fully-featured models, with support for the full DirectX 12 Ultimate feature set (ray tracing, VRS, mesh shading, sampler feedback) plus DirectStorage and XeSS AI upscaling. That puts them on an even keel with Nvidia in terms of most features, and ahead of AMD who don&#x27;t yet have a temporal upscaling solution. 
Intel detailed some specs for each of the five models announced thus far, including the number of Xe cores, ray tracing units and GDDR6 memory allocation. Given the relatively rapid scaling between families - we see a doubling of core count and VRAM from the top Arc 3 model to Arc 5, then another doubling to the top Arc 7 model - we could start to see very impressive performance from those top-end models.

                              <span>Today marks the launch of Intel&#x27;s Arc A-series graphics family, the company&#x27;s first discrete graphics cards to go head to head against industry titans AMD and Nvidia. To start, Team Blue is building its Arc GPUs for laptops, with entry-level Arc 3 models debuting now in laptops from $899. Higher-powered models called Arc 5 and Arc 7 are set to arrive early this summer, in higher-end machines. The company also teased its first desktop Arc graphics card at the very end of its presentation, showing off a much beefier design than the DG1 card shipped to developers last year. Here&#x27;s what you need to know from Intel&#x27;s Arc announcements.
First of all, the Arc series of graphics cards ought to be fully-featured models, with support for the full DirectX 12 Ultimate feature set (ray tracing, VRS, mesh shading, sampler feedback) plus DirectStorage and XeSS AI upscaling. That puts them on an even keel with Nvidia in terms of most features, and ahead of AMD who don&#x27;t yet have a temporal upscaling solution.

                              <span>Sony has warned PlayStation 5 owners that Persona 5 is being removed from its PlayStation Plus Collection on 11th May.
The PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside PS5 back in 2020, giving PlayStation Plus members on Sony&#x27;s new console access to 20 first- and third-party PlayStation 4 titles for as long as their subscription continued:
From 11th May, however, that impressive list will be down by one, as announced at the bottom of April&#x27;s PlayStation Plus games reveal. Anyone still wishing to take advantage of Persona 5&#x27;s inclusion still have time to do so, though - they&#x27;ll just need to ensure they&#x27;ve added the game to their library prior to the 11th May deadline. As long as this is done, the game will continue to be available while a PlayStation Plus subscription is active.

                              <span>Acclaimed Industrial-Revolution-era city builder Anno 1800 has enjoyed significant success since its release in 2019 - having surpassed more than 2m players at last count - and Ubisoft is capitalising on its continuing popularity with a fourth season of DLC. That much we already knew, but now the publisher has provided early details of Season 4 - which will include the likes of airplanes and agricultural revolution - revealing its first DLC will arrive on 12th April.
As outlined in Ubisoft&#x27;s new introductory video, Anno 1800&#x27;s fourth season will introduce a total of three new paid DLCs before 2022 is through, with its first offering being titled Seeds of Change. Arriving on 12th April, this will enable players to &quot;revolutionise&quot; the agricultural sector of the New World, introducing a powerful new building - the Hacienda - that will become the agricultural hub of players&#x27; empires.
Expanding the Hacienda with its various modules will enable players to gain access to a range of new agriculture-centric features, including the ability to produce import goods in the New World (such as beer) in order to help the population become more independent. Additionally, players will be able to adopt island-wide policies and produce high-quality fertiliser to boost farms in both the New and Old Worlds.

                              <span>343 Industries describes Master Chief removing his helmet in the new Halo TV series as &quot;a mission statement&quot;.
In a lengthy blog post from 343 Industries community writer Alex Wakeford dissecting the opening episode (it&#x27;s full of spoilers!), the matter of the lead character removing his helmet is addressed, seemingly in response to fan criticism.
The post notes that the games &quot;have predominantly been a space for player projection&quot;, but fans of the expanded universe shouldn&#x27;t be quite so surprised.

However, lead writer Sam Maggs has responded to IGN&#x27;s coverage stating &quot;it&#x27;s pretty upsetting and frankly offensive&quot; that she wasn&#x27;t included in Stuart&#x27;s talk, adding &quot;sucks to have my work erased&quot;.

As a post from the studio on Russian social network VK explains, some players may be unable to make payments on Steam, while for Switch owners Nintendo has suspended Russian payments in the eShop.

&quot;Funomena was in the process of closing an investment round just before GDC, and we are still actively working to do so,&quot; reads the tweet. &quot;Last week we let everyone know that if we do not successfully finish the fundraise, we will be forced to close the studio.
&quot;We love game development, we love making games and we love bringing people into the community. It is our sincere hope that we can continue to do so, together.&quot;

Police reportedly arrived on the scene last week and found the man crouched beside the woman’s passenger side door. According to the police, the man had, at some point, wrapped his Apple Watch across the spokes of the woman’s passenger side front car wheel and then used the Watch to track her movements. When police eventually confronted him, he admitted the Watch was his. Now, he’s reportedly being charged with attaching an electronic tracking device to the woman’s vehicle.

                              <span>Despite being used as a showcase for Xbox Series X/S&#x27; raytracing capabilities prior to the console&#x27;s launch in 2020, Minecraft has so far remained doggedly raytracing-free on the machine. That looks to be about to change, however, with the feature having now surfaced in the latest build of Minecraft&#x27;s Xbox Preview programme.
As spotted by Tom Warren, senior editor on The Verge, Minecraft&#x27;s latest Preview version on Xbox Series X/S (currently only available to Xbox Insider members) features raytracing as a toggle-able option, giving the more-than-a-decade-old game a bit of a modern day spruce-up.

                              <span>Developer Funomena, which collaborated with Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi on 2020&#x27;s Wattam, is reportedly closing down following recent allegations of workplace abuse at the studio, all focussing on company boss Robin Hunicke.
Those allegations first came to light last week as part of an investigation by People Make Games into workplace abuses at three indie studios. In that report, People Make Games&#x27; Chris Bratt spoken to Funomena staff who claimed Hunicke was emotionally abusive and often used sensitive personal information in a way that was humiliating or unprofessional, with some employees describing Hunicke as &quot;the instigator of a huge amount of toxicity&quot; at the studio.

                              <span>A US district court judge has confirmed they&#x27;re &quot;prepared to approve&quot; Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard&#x27;s $18m USD settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year, despite objections from other parties.
Activision Blizzard initially announced it had reached an agreement with the EEOC - to set aside $18m for employees who had experienced harassment and discrimination at the company - last September, but court approval of the settlement was delayed after California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing objected.
In that objection, the DFEH - which had filed its own bombshell lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in July last year, calling the publisher a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - claimed the settlement would cause &quot;irreparable harm&quot; to its own ongoing legal proceedings if approved, given that its terms would, among other things, require employees to release Activision Blizzard from claims under California state law.

                              <span>If cute critters of the damp variety are your thing, Frontier Developments has you covered in Planet Zoo&#x27;s latest DLC expansion, known as the Wetlands Animal Pack, which will introduce the likes of the capybara, platypus, and more when it heads to PC on 12th April.
Wetlands, if you haven&#x27;t been keeping a tally, will be Planet Zoo&#x27;s ninth DLC expansion since its launch in 2019, following on from the Arctic Pack, South America Pack, Australia Pack, Aquatic Pack, Southeast Asia Animal Pack, Africa Pack, North America Animal Pack, and Europe Pack.
Given that this latest expansion falls into the &#x27;Animal Pack&#x27; category, it lacks the zoo-sprucing scenery items seen in Planet Zoo&#x27;s just plain-old &#x27;Pack&#x27; packs, instead choosing to focus on a boosted number of creature additions - in this case bringing a grand total of eight new water-themed species: the capybara, platypus, Asian small-clawed otter, spectacled caiman, Nile lechwe, wild water buffalo, red-crowned crane, and Danube crested newt.

Unpacking initially burst out of its box toward the end of last year, giving PC, Switch, and Xbox players the opportunity to experience significant moments in the life of its protagonist, as relayed entirely through the act of pulling her current possessions out of boxes and packing them away into a new living space each time.
&quot;Here&#x27;s a puzzle game, at surface, about tidying things away,&quot; wrote Martin Robinson on announcing Unpacking as Eurogamer&#x27;s Game of the Year in 2021, &quot;a premise that&#x27;s compelling enough alone. There&#x27;s something soothing about the fundamentals of neatly folding away t-shirts and socks while proudly stacking books on once empty shelves.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Witch Beam&#x27;s &quot;zen&quot; puzzler Unpacking - which, you may recall, was named Eurogamer&#x27;s Game of the Year in 2021 - will be making its way to PlayStation 4 and PS5 &quot;soon&quot;.
Unpacking initially burst out of its box toward the end of last year, giving PC, Switch, and Xbox players the opportunity to experience significant moments in the life of its protagonist, as relayed entirely through the act of pulling her current possessions out of boxes and packing them away into a new living space each time.

                              <span>With April inching ever closer, Microsoft has hoisted its Games With Gold sack once more, upending it to reveal a fresh selection of titles being made available as part of Xbox Live Gold (and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) subscriptions next month, which this time look an awful lot like Hue, Another Sight, Outpost Kaloki X, and MX vs ATV Alive.
Hue, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is puzzle adventure that sees players wandering a grey world and using their colour-based powers to push ever forward. Puzzles are largely built around the ability to change the background colour of the world, either causing previously invisible objects to be made visible or to colour-match obstacles so they disappear. Developer Fiddlesticks Games expands on that premise to deliver an experience that&#x27;s as sweet as it is clever - and Xbox Live Gold subscribers can grab it as part of Games With Gold from 16th April to 15th May.
As for Another Sight, it&#x27;s a &quot;surreal fantasy adventure&quot; with another distinctive mechanic at its core. Here, players take on the role of a partially sighted girl named Kit and her cat Hodge, flipping between the two and using their respective abilities to solve puzzles and progress - Hodge being smaller, more agile and able to view much more of the environment on-screen, and Kit being more attuned to noises around her and able to manipulate larger objects. It&#x27;s available on Games With Gold from 1st-30th April.

Along with this announcement, Supermassive ominously states Buckley and players should &quot;get ready for an unforgettable stay...&quot; (I&#x27;m not scared, you are).

However, the developer did affirm that while the game is retiring, those who own it already will be able to keep playing in offline mode right up until the point the app is removed completely from devices.

                              <span>In response to last week&#x27;s incident in which Destiny videos by prominent content creators on YouTube were hit with a spate of false copyright takedowns, developer Bungie has filed a lawsuit against ten unnamed individuals it believes responsible.
At the time of the incident, Bungie - whose own YouTube content was impacted by the bogus copyright claims - insisted the takedowns were not the result of a request by either itself or its partners. The studio later revealed the takedowns had come from &quot;fraudulent accounts created to impersonate our IP protection service&quot;, which it believed may have been retaliation for a &quot;recent set of authentic takedowns of OST uploads&quot;.
Following the results of its initial investigation, Bungie has now (thanks TorrentFreak) launched legal action against ten unnamed individuals, who it admits it does not yet know the identity of, but says it will &quot;discover...soon, via subpoena or otherwise&quot;. However, while those individuals - and the &quot;nearly incalculable damage&quot; their actions caused - are the focus of the lawsuit, it also has more than a few choice words for Google, extensively highlighting the flaws in what it calls the &quot;gaping security loophole&quot; of YouTube&#x27;s &quot;easily-gamed&quot; DMCA-process security.

                              <span>Last Friday marked the ninth anniversary of free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, and developer Digital Extremes has now donned its jaunty party hat in order to celebrate the not-insignificant milestone with a birthday freebie and five weeks of premium rewards.
On the freebie front, players will receive the Wisp Dex Skin - the same one used in Warframe&#x27;s 9th anniversary art below - via an Inbox Message in their Orbiter upon logging into the game for a limited time. In addition to that, Digital Extremes has prepared five weeks of premium Anniversary Rewards - including Skins, Weapon Slots, and Noggles (basically, bobbleheads for your Orbiter) - which can be earned by completing weekly in-game Alerts.
Rounding out each week of rewards are special Weekend Booster events - enabling players to earn Double Affinity, Double Credits, or both, depending on the weekend in question - and the full list of Alert Rewards and Weekend Boosters can be found below. Illustrative images for the rewards, incidentally, are available on the Warframe anniversary website.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has unveiled One Piece Odyssey, a new RPG adaptation of the hugely popular anime and manga series, which will feature a brand-new story - plus new character and monster designs - from creator Eiichiro Oda when it comes to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC later this year.
One Piece Odyssey unfolds on a mysterious island - which the Straw Hats pirate gang discover after their ship is caught in a storm - with Bandai Namco promising dungeons, quests, &quot;wonders of a raging nature, powerful enemies, and strange encounters with island locals&quot;.
Odyssey&#x27;s announcement trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal much beyond an apparent exploration focus for the &quot;epic drama adventure&quot;, but Bandai Namco notes players won&#x27;t just take control of series protagonist Monkey D. Luffy as the new adventure unfolds; they&#x27;ll also be able to play as other familiar faces, including Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Frankie, and Brook.

                              <span>Black streamers on Twitch have joined forces with Color Of Change on a campaign demanding #TwitchDoBetter.

The trademark was filed in Japan on the 17th of March, with the filing made public today (nice spot, Gematsu).

                              <span>Developer Endnight Games has announced its upcoming game Sons of the Forest has been delayed.
Sons of the Forest is the sequel to Endnight&#x27;s The Forest, and promises plenty more unnerving gameplay for survival-horror fans.

                              <span>Developer Endnight Games has announced its upcoming game Sons of the Forest has been delayed.

The law, known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), has yet to be passed by the European Parliament but if accepted could be enforced as early as October.

Developer Innersloth announced on its social media channels over the weekend that owing to a DDoS attack on both North American and European servers, &quot;servers are still down while [it] works to fix&quot; the issue.
&quot;We have a sabotage going on lol,&quot; the official communications account tweeted at the start of the attack. &quot;NA and EU servers are getting DDoS&#x27;d. Service will be offline while the team works on fixing it, but might take a bit, hang tight!!!!! Sorry!!!

There&#x27;s also custom racing, which allows players to find races &quot;for their chosen race discipline and PI class&quot;, as well as fixes to some scenarios where &quot;the player could be left waiting longer than necessary in the post-race flow&quot;.

                              <span>Valve is seeking your feedback about your experiences with &quot;verified&quot; Steam games thus far on Steam Deck.
The lucky souls who managed to snag an early Steam Deck pre-order have had their units for a few weeks now, and consequently, Valve would like to know how they&#x27;re finding it, particularly if you&#x27;re playing games that have been marked as &quot;verified&quot; - that is, games that had been tested and deemed to run smoothly and without glitches or bugs. 
&quot;The initial data we&#x27;re gathering in this way is about titles that are Steam Deck Verified,&quot; Valve explains. &quot;We&#x27;re able to collect objective data (crashes, etc.) to help us understand how well the technical side of our review process is working, but ultimately the Deck compatibility ratings are about the overall experience: the definition of &#x27;working well&#x27; is succeeding at enabling current and future Deck customers to find the experiences they want.

                              <span>Valve is seeking your feedback about your experiences with &quot;verified&quot; Steam games thus far on Steam Deck.
The lucky souls who managed to snag an early Steam Deck pre-order have had their units for a few weeks now, and consequently, Valve would like to know how they&#x27;re finding it, particularly if you&#x27;re playing games that have been marked as &quot;verified&quot; - that is, games that had been tested and deemed to run smoothly and without glitches or bugs.

                              <span>PUGB - the original, and now free-to-play, battle royale - has unveiled its 2022 roadmap.
That said, the team&#x27;s keen for you to know that &quot;everything we&#x27;re sharing today along with any mentioned timelines are all subject to change&quot; as &quot;game development can be a finicky thing and priorities can change based on issues that arise and feedback&quot;. Oh, and it&#x27;s still keeping back a surprise or two, too.
As for what&#x27;s coming up? Though succinct, the roadmap divides its plans into the categories &quot;world&quot;, &quot;ingame&quot;, and &quot;outgame&quot;. In the next few weeks, we should get a Sanhok rollback - it&#x27;s coming back &quot;in its original form&quot; - weapon balancing, and unspecified quality of life improvements that &quot;reduce inconvenience without affecting core gameplay&quot;. There&#x27;s a new gun, too - the new 7.62mm assault rifle that has a lower DPS than other ARs but is easier to control.

In an update posted to Xbox Wire, Chris Charla - general manager of content curation and programs - acknowledged that whilst the team &quot;really didn&#x27;t know much&quot; at the time the ID@Xbox program was launched nine years ago, Xbox understood that &quot;[its] players loved the artistry and diversity delivered by independent developers&quot; and &quot;had to do everything we could to help developers maximise their success on the Xbox ecosystem&quot;.
The results of the ID@Xbox - which have &quot;exceeded [Xbox&#x27;s] wildest dreams&quot; - also saw &quot;total revenue generated by ID@Xbox partners on Xbox almost double over the last three years&quot;.

                              <span>The eagerly-anticipated Halo TV show has reportedly set a new premiere viewership record for Paramount+. 
While it remains to be seen how many of those viewers will stick about after their one month trial expires - Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers were given a month free to celebrate the show&#x27;s launch - Deadline reports that the show has &quot;set a new record as the service&#x27;s most-watched series premiere globally in its first 24 hours&quot;. 
No hard numbers have been offered to back up Paramount+&#x27;s claim, but Deadline points out that if true, this means Halo exceeds the previous record set by Yellowstone prequel 1883, which drew 4.9 million viewers. We should know more when the US&#x27; Nielsen Top 10 streaming rankings releases later this week which, up until now, has never featured a Paramount+ original show.

                              <span>Research:
Abstract: The retreating ice cover of the Central Arctic Ocean (CAO) fuels speculations on future fisheries. However, very little is known about the existence of harvestable fish stocks in this 3.3 million­–square kilometer ecosystem around the North Pole. Crossing the Eurasian Basin, we documented an uninterrupted 3170-kilometer-long deep scattering layer (DSL) with zooplankton and small fish in the Atlantic water layer at 100- to 500-meter depth. Diel vertical migration of this central Arctic DSL was lacking most of the year when daily light variation was absent. Unexpectedly, the DSL also contained low abundances of Atlantic cod, along with lanternfish, armhook squid, and Arctic endemic ice cod. The Atlantic cod originated from Norwegian spawning grounds and had lived in Arctic water temperature for up to 6 years. The potential fish abundance was far below commercially sustainable levels and is expected to remain so because of the low productivity of the CAO...</span>

                              <span>Gus Simmons is an early pioneer in cryptography and computer security. I know him best for his work on authentication and covert channels, specifically as related to nuclear treaty verification. His work is cited extensively in Applied Cryptography.
He has written a memoir of growing up dirt-poor in 1930s rural West Virginia. I’m in the middle of reading it, and it’s fascinating.

The Skyblivion team has been steadily documenting its progress on YouTube since 2013 - hosting everything from livestreams of asset creation to developer interviews - but, as the project nudges ever-closer to completion, it&#x27;s embarked on a series of development diaries, showcasing different aspects of the mod&#x27;s reimagined Cyrodiil in action.

                              <span>Elden Ring players have discovered what appears to be a glitch in order to kill enemies with invisible magic projectiles.

Lego Bricktales, as detailed on its newly materialised Steam page, sees players traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they attempt to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park, with assistance from a cute robot pal.

                              <span>A new lawsuit filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of a current Activision Blizzard employee has raised fresh allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at the publisher, also accusing it of retaliation after the employee publicly spoke out about her experiences at the company in December.
According to the lawsuit, as reported by Bloomberg Law, the employee - referred to only as Jane Doe - started work as a senior administrative assistant to executives in Activision Blizzard&#x27;s IT department in 2017. It&#x27;s claimed Doe was often pressured to drink alcohol at the company, was subjected to sexual comments about her appearance and clothing, was subjected unwelcome physical touching and attempts to kiss her, and that women were routinely made to participate in &quot;cube crawls&quot; where they experienced sexual comments and groping.

Lost Judgment is the sequel to 2018&#x27;s Judgment, and sees the return of protagonist Takayuki Yagami, an ex-defence-attorney turned private detective, for an possibly even more sprawling open-world adventure through Kamurocho and Isezaki Ijincho.

                              <span>The legendary footballer Diego Maradona has now been &quot;suspended&quot; from FIFA 22, following a legal dispute which claimed EA had negotiated with the wrong party and therefore did not have the rights to use his likeness.
In a message that appears when starting up the game, EA states: &quot;Due to a third party legal dispute, we must suspend Diego Maradona from appearing in FIFA Ultimate Team Packs, Ultimate Draft and the Soccer Aid World XI team.

                              <span>The Office of Inspector General has audited NASA’s insider threat program:
While NASA has a fully operational insider threat program for its classified systems, the vast majority of the Agency’s information technology (IT) systems — including many containing high-value assets or critical infrastructure — are unclassified and are therefore not covered by its current insider threat program. Consequently, the Agency may be facing a higher-than-necessary risk to its unclassified systems and data. While NASA’s exclusion of unclassified systems from its insider threat program is common among federal agencies, adding those systems to a multi-faceted security program could provide an additional level of maturity to the program and better protect agency resources. According to Agency officials, expanding the insider threat program to unclassified systems would benefit the Agency’s cybersecurity posture if incremental improvements, such as focusing on IT systems and people at the most risk, were  implemented. However, on-going concerns including staffing challenges, technology resource limitations, and lack of funding to support such an expansion would need to be addressed prior to enhancing the existing program...</span>

Games Done Quick organisers opted to ditch the annual summer speed-running event&#x27;s real-world component back in June 2020, as the severity of the coronavirus outbreak become more widely understood, and the online-only model has remained in place for all its events since then, including January&#x27;s annual Awesome Games Done Quick showcase.

                              <span>News:
The White House has issued its starkest warning that Russia may be planning cyberattacks against critical-sector U.S. companies amid the Ukraine invasion.
[…]
Context: The alert comes after Russia has lobbed a series of digital attacks at the Ukrainian government and critical industry sectors. But there’s been no sign so far of major disruptive hacks against U.S. targets even as the government has imposed increasingly harsh sanctions that have battered the Russian economy.

                              <span>With a physical E3 once again ruled out this year, and the show&#x27;s digital plans still uncertain, all eyes are on the big publishers to see how they might continue to fill the void left by the long-running industry show. And according to a new report, Ubisoft is currently prepping a &quot;massive&quot; showcase event of its own, where it could reveal the unannounced likes of a new Prince of Persia game and an Immortals Fenix Rising sequel.
According to reliable leaker Tom Henderson, who cites &quot;several sources with direct knowledge of Ubisoft&#x27;s plans&quot; in an article on Xfire, Ubisoft currently has around 20 games lined up and ready for some kind of announcement in the &quot;near future&quot;. Most of these we already know about - including the likes of Assasin&#x27;s Creed Infinity, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, and Beyond Good and Evil 2 - but a couple have yet to get any kind of official reveal.

                              <span>Techland&#x27;s next-gen spruce-up of the original Dying Light is, following its recent PS5 release, now available on Xbox Series X/S, with enhancements available for Xbox One X too.
As was the case on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X owners will be able to switch between one of three different video modes once today&#x27;s Dying Light patch is downloaded. Performance mode looks to deliver 60fps in full HD resolution, while Quality mode supports 30fps in 4K. Coming in somewhere between the two is Balanced mode, targeting 60fps in QHD resolution.

                              <span>After a bit of a pause while Sea of Thieves put its pieces in place for Season 6, the multiplayer pirate adventure will soon be embarking on the second episode in its new ongoing storyline, Forts of the Forgotten, with proceedings getting underway this Thursday, 24th March.
As Rare detailed earlier this year, Sea of Thieves&#x27; new limited-time adventures will arrive on a monthly basis, each one propelling the events of an overarching narrative steadily forward. The first of these arrived (albeit in a somewhat underwhelming fashion) in February&#x27;s Shrouded Islands update, which set the scene for adventures to come when a mysterious fog engulfed the now-deserted Golden Sands outpost and a key character in Sea of Thieves&#x27; lore, Belle, made her long-awaited in-game debut.

Godfall initially launched for PlayStation 5 and PC via the Epic Games Store back in November 2020 (and a PlayStation 4 version arrived in November last year), taking players and up to two co-op pals on a loot-drenched action romp - all clashing swords and smashing hammers - through a gorgeously wrought fantasy world.

                              <span>Last week, there was a faint flutter in Elden Ring circles after fans spotted a cute little detail: that George R. R. Martin appeared to have inserted himself into the game while writing its background lore by naming all its major players - who you&#x27;ll inevitably encounter as bosses at some point or other - after his own initials. In response, the Game of Thrones author has now taken to the internet to dismiss the theory as being all a bit daft.
In fairness, it&#x27;s a compelling notion; as a cursory glance at Elden Ring&#x27;s character list will quickly reveal, four of the most significant players in the game&#x27;s lore all have names beginning with either the letters G, R, or M - there&#x27;s Godfrey, for instance, Rennala, Radagon, and Marika. And if you want to go further down their respective family trees, there are plenty more Gs, Rs, and Ms to be found: Godwyn, Radahn, Ranni, Rykard, Renna, Mogh, Miquella, and so on.

                              <span>In the face of a dwindling player base for fantasy MMO New World following its barnstorming launch last September, Amazon Games has shared a &quot;broad overview&quot; of its content release plans for the game&#x27;s next three seasons in 2022.
As previously announced, March will see the formal arrival of New World&#x27;s Heart of Madness update - it was made available on the public test realm earlier this month - bringing the game&#x27;s main storyline to a close with a new endgame expedition, Tempest&#x27;s Heart, which promises a &quot;final showdown&quot; against Isabella in a corrupted dimension of reality.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard - which continues its attempts to reassert itself following many months of shocking allegations it had fostered a company culture where sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has announced its previously detailed Overwatch 2 beta will launch on 26th April.
Blizzard revealed its intentions to &quot;decouple&quot; Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvP and PvE modes and begin a series of multiplayer-focused betas earlier this month, when game director Aaron Keller rather dubiously attempted to spin the developer&#x27;s upcoming beta sessions as some sort of generous treat for content-starved Overwatch 1 players rather than the limited testing sessions for a select number of players they actually are.

When first we heard of Nine Sols last year, Red Candle described it as a &quot;lore rich hand-drawn 2D platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat&quot; - and an accompany bit of concept art set the dark, manga-inspired tone of the experience with its combination of cute animal protagonist and piles of mangled, bloody limbs.

It&#x27;s a move that has caused considerable consternation amongst the Gran Turismo community, and understandably so given the ability to buy in-game currency on the PlayStation Store, with the game&#x27;s miserly in-game economy seemingly pushing players towards microtransactions. It&#x27;s feedback that hasn&#x27;t gone unnoticed, with the update accompanied by a note from series creator Kazunori Yamauchi.

                              <span>Cosmo D, the developer behind acclaimed first-person jazz-hotel adventure The Norwood Suite, has unveiled Betrayal At Club Low - the latest entry in his deliciously surreal Off-Peak City saga, which comes to Steam this &quot;summer&quot;.
While Betrayal At Club Low promises more of the same off-kilter energy that helped make The Norwood Suite and its follow-up Tales from Off-Peak City Vol. 1 so memorable (and don&#x27;t just take my word for it), things are a little different this time around.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known for a while that Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s free-to-play battle royale shooter was edging toward its global release on mobile, and now the developer has announced it&#x27;s aiming for a full launch on iOS and Android this &quot;summer&quot;, with Android pre-registrations now open.
News of Apex Legends&#x27; transition to mobile arrived last April, with Respawn confirming it would be a specially designed version, featuring the likes of streamlined controls for touchscreens. It&#x27;s also completely separate from its consoles and PC counterparts (meaning no cross-play with those versions), featuring unique battle passes, even mobile-only maps and gameplay modes.

Not to be confused with last year&#x27;s four-episode CGI effort Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, or indeed the non-Netflix-related live-action movie reboot Welcome to Raccoon City, the series known only as Resident Evil splits its narrative across two timelines, straddling either side of a global apocalypse caused by a deadly virus.

Coming from the same team that brought us the Wendigo filled nightmare of Until Dawn, The Quarry will once more focus on a group of teens. But rather than a snowy cabin escape, this time the game will focus on nine counsellors on their last day of summer camp.

Stray Gods is the work of Australian developer Summerfall Studios - where Gaider now serves as creative director, having co-founded the company in 2019 - and was previously known as Chorus: An Adventure Musical in its Kickstarter days. Described as &quot;one part narrative-driven adventure and one part interactive musical&quot;, Stray Gods follows the story of Grace, a young woman whose life is upended after the Last Muse of ancient Greek mythology dies in her arms.

The original Monaco debuted almost a decade ago, back in 2013, challenging players - either alone or with three co-op friends in tow - to orchestrate the perfect heist. As in the movies, that required assembling a crew of uniquely able criminals (from locksmiths and tunnellers to a pickpocket with a monkey in this case) before attempting to navigate each labyrinthine map&#x27;s security and patrols in order to claim the prize. Chaos usually ensues.

                              <span>Still hungering for more indie-flavoured video game news following last night&#x27;s big Xbox showcase? Well, you&#x27;re in luck, courtesy of Humble Games, which has just given its slate of upcoming titles an airing in a series of its own reveals. And if you missed it, you can catch up with everything the publisher shared by perusing the words below.
Things got off to an exciting start with in the form of Monaco 2, the sequel to Pocketwatch Games&#x27; acclaimed heist caper. Unsurprisingly, chaotic heists remain the focus in this follow-up, but there&#x27;s a new emphasis on verticality in the procedurally generated stages - made possible thanks to a visual style shift to fully, isometric 3D.

                              <span>Despite being loaded with Spartans and warthogs left, right and centre, the trailer for the upcoming Halo TV show that debuted at the Super Bowl was mostly discussed because it featured a Chevy Tahoe in the background.
Why exactly was this car there? After all, the Chevy Tahoe in question is a GMT800, a model from the early noughties. Given that that is roughly 500 years before Master Chief&#x27;s time, it is unlikely that any of these cars would actually still be around.

This is known as a &#x27;Crotch chop&#x27;, and not something that many would expect to see in the family friendly Mario games. 
And yet, we did.

Alien Soldier and Light Crusader lead the way, the former a boss-rush side-scroller that plays out as if Jeff Minter had a hand in a Gunstar Heroes remix, the latter an action adventure that sits apart from the rest of Treasure&#x27;s back catalogue with its darker fantasy tone.

Among a number of new additions, the most interesting is the addition of NPC markers to the map. Where some players have lost the thread of in-game quests (even making an app for it), now it will be a lot easier to keep track of characters.

                              <span>Those with an excess of free time and patient resolve might very well have delighted at Microsoft&#x27;s latest, typically languid Xbox indie showcase, but for everyone with somewhat busier diaries, please enjoy this convenient summary of everything shown, bringing the likes of co-op escape room shenanigans, movie-themed mystery, and rogue-like golfing in purgatory.
Lost Eidolons, which kicked off today&#x27;s livestream, is a tactical RPG from developer Ocean Drive Studio that casts players as Eden, a mercenary captain, sending them on an adventure across an empire riven by civil war. Expect turn-based battling and a &quot;gripping cinematic narrative&quot; when this one comes to PC and Xbox Series X/S in Q3 this year.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nearly two years since Telling Lies and Her Story creator Sam Barlow began to tease his next FMV narrative mystery Immortality (then known as Project Ambrosio), but finally the cinema-inspired &quot;investigative horror&quot; has received its first proper reveal.
Barlow actually outlined Immortality&#x27;s basic concept last June, revealing it would tell the story of Marissa Marcel, an actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.

Originally known as Secret Legend before getting a name change to Tunic at E3 2017, the Zelda-inspired isometric adventure was initially expected to arrive in 2018. Cleary, it did not meet that target, but its long-awaited launch is now upon us, and available to purchase digitally on your platform of choice for £24.99/€29.99/$29.99 USD.

There aren’t many weak keys out there, but there are some:
So far, Böck has identified only a handful of keys in the wild that are vulnerable to the factorization attack. Some of the keys are from printers from two manufacturers, Canon and Fujifilm (originally branded as Fuji Xerox). Printer users can use the keys to generate a Certificate Signing Request. The creation date for the all the weak keys was 2020 or later. The weak Canon keys are tracked as CVE-2022-26351...</span>

                              <span>Usually when I talk about AWS regions and availability zones, it ties back to [data transfer pricing] or some other model of cloud economics. Today I want to take a different angle: it&#x27;s my belief that how I think about AWS regions and how AWS talks about them are somewhat far apart. The reason I&#x27;m doing this in blog form instead of as a Twitter stunt or whatnot is that I&#x27;m not particularly intending to be funny, and to be transparent, I&#x27;m not completely sure whether I&#x27;m right or not. Let&#x27;s dive in.

EA Play Live, which debuted back in 2016, has traditionally been held alongside E3, combining game announcements with hands-on demos for those able to attend in person. The show had transitioned to a digital-only offering in the last two years in response to the coronavirus pandemic, but now EA has opted to cancel its 2022 event in its entirety.

                              <span>One favourite (and sometimes infuriating) feature of The Sims 3 that never made the leap to The Sims 4 was story progression - giving non-active Sims households the ability to make significant, autonomous life decisions in the background - but now, as part of a surprise addition in The Sims 4&#x27;s latest patch, that previously absent element has returned in a big way.
EA first revealed it had started dabbling with story progression for The Sims 4 (a feature it&#x27;s now referring to as Neighbourhood Stories) last November, explaining there was &quot;a lot we want to do&quot; to bring more life to the world outside of active households.

                              <span>Last year ended on a high for Warframe as developer Digital Extremes unleashed The New War - the free-to-play sci-fi shooter&#x27;s biggest story expansion yet - and, following a well-earned exhale, the studio is back next month with the first big update of 2022, Angels of the Zariman.
Angels of the Zariman is a many faceted thing but core to the experience is the latest instalment in Warframe&#x27;s ongoing Cinematic Quest saga - the single-player, story driven portion of the game that now includes around 30 hours of content - this one picking up after the events of The New War, taking players to the Zariman Ten Zero, an Orokin ship, crucial to Warframe lore, that vanished during a Void-Jump accident.

Sunbreak will, we&#x27;re told, pick up immediately following the resolution of the base game&#x27;s Rampage storyline, with the expansion&#x27;s new story arc kicking into gear when previously revealed new monster Lunagaron - plus Dame Fioyrane, a royal knight from a distant kingdom - are sighted in Rise&#x27;s familiar Shrine Ruins area. Capcom reminds players that Sunbreak can be accessed after completing the 7-star hub quest Serpent Goddess of Thunder in the base game and that a selection of powerful support items are now available to players via a recent free update should they want to accelerate their progress in preparation for the expansion.

Copies of this book can still be found online for those who wish to collect some Mario memorabilia. But those less concerned with owning physical items but still have an interest in Nintendo&#x27;s history are now in luck, as Dave Shevlin from Video Game Comfort Food has uploaded the entire book to the internet (thanks, Kotaku).

                              <span>Rockstar has detailed the steps required to migrate GTA Online progress from PS4 or Xbox One to the enhanced PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version ahead of release tomorrow, 15th March, but says it&#x27;s &quot;working to resolve&quot; an issue affecting players who&#x27;ve previously migrated to PC.
GTA Online profiles can be migrated via a Rockstar Games Social Club account upon loading the Xbox Series X/S or PS5 game, as detailed on Rockstar&#x27;s support page. This one-time process will enable players to migrate their characters, GTA$, progression, stats, vehicles, properties, weapons, clothing, and player-created jobs, but Rockstar notes the account will no longer be available on last-gen consoles after migration is complete.

                              <span>Babylon&#x27;s Fall, it&#x27;s fair to say, hasn&#x27;t got off to the strongest of starts. Not only did the Square Enix and PlatinumGames collaboration launch to mediocre reviews, it struggled to attract much interest from players. And now, following Babylon&#x27;s Fall&#x27;s limp reception, Square has launched a survey in a bid to help &quot;bring everyone an even better game experience&quot;.
Given the expansive range of problems critics and players have highlighted in regards to Babylon&#x27;s Fall since launch - from unremarkable combat to unwelcome live-service elements - Square and PlatinumGames could have taken any number of directions for its first post-release survey, but the focus this time around is on another roundly criticised area: its visuals.

As detailed on the event&#x27;s official website, the one-off concert will take place on 11th August at the Tokyo Garden Theatre and will feature original medleys of songs from Kirby&#x27;s back catalogue, as played by a &quot;large big band-style ensemble&quot; of 35 musicians.
