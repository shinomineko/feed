                              <span>Sony has confirmed it&#x27;ll finally start rolling out Variable Refresh Rate support to PlayStation 5 in the new few days, with patches to implement the feature across a variety of games - included Spider-Man and Resident Evil Village - set to follow &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;.


VRR dynamically syncs the refresh rate of HDMI 2.1 VRR-compatible TVs and PC monitors to the PlayStation 5&#x27;s graphical output, helping, as Sony puts it in its announcement post, to minimise or eliminate visual artifacts, including frame pacing issues and screen tearing.


&quot;Gameplay in many PS5 titles feels smoother as scenes render seamlessly, graphics look crisper, and input lag is reduced,&quot; it adds.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s Ace Attorney series has some very good music (especially the one that goes dur-doo-dur-doo-dur-doo-dur-doo-dur-durr from the first Phoenix Wright game) and the publisher is celebrating that fact once again this year with a new live orchestral concert, being streamed across the internet in May.
Following on from last year&#x27;s similarly styled event, Capcom is poised to hold another Ace Attorney orchestra concert on 7th May at the Bunkamura Orchard Hall in Shibuya, Tokyo, this time in honour of the series&#x27; 20th anniversary.
If your interest is piqued, the official website has now revealed the full, series-spanning set list for the 20th anniversary concert (which you&#x27;ll find below) and you can get a solid idea of what&#x27;s in store by watching this 7-minute snippet from the 2021 show.

                              <span>This weekend marked the tenth anniversary of Telltale Games&#x27; celebrated The Walking Dead series, and to mark the occasion, publisher Skybound Games has released a new mini-documentary bringing with it various behind-the-scenes treats, including early prototype footage, and even the revelation that Telltales&#x27; genre-defining adventure was at one point planned to be a Left 4 Dead spin-off.


Telltale Games&#x27; The Walking Dead first released on 24th April 2012, and, over the course of Season 1&#x27;s five critically acclaimed episodes, would establish not only the template for pretty much every one of the studio&#x27;s releases from that point onward - blending real-time events and persistent choices - but a host of other narrative-driven adventures too, most notably the work of Life is Strange developer Dontnod.


However, as revealed by The Walking Dead&#x27;s season design and direction lead Jake Rodkin in the newly released mini-documentary, Telltale could have ended up with a very different zombie experience if it&#x27;s original plans had come to pass, given the project started life as a pitch to do a narrative side-story within Valve&#x27;s Left 4 Dead universe.

                              <span>Right on cue, with Apex Legends&#x27; current season rapidly racing towards its conclusion, developer Respawn Entertainment has started cranking the hype handle for the free-to-play battle royale shooter&#x27;s imminent thirteenth instalment - confirming that Newcastle will play a major role when it launches on 10th May.
Newcastle, who&#x27;ll be Season 13&#x27;s latest playable hero (sorry to disappoint if you had other ideas), is described as the Hero of Harris Valley, but, more importantly in lore terms, has a direct connection to another Apex Legends character - with Respawn confirming Newcastle to be none other than Jackson Williams, the long-missing brother of Bangalore.
Newcastle&#x27;s arrival in Apex Legends isn&#x27;t too much of a surprise, of course; back in March, a huge Apex Legends leak seemingly revealed, accurately it now appears, the game&#x27;s next nine seasons&#x27; worth of unannounced heroes - with Newcastle being the most likely candidate for Season 13 at the time, given his advanced stages of development.

In a joint press release, the companies wrote: &quot;[We are] pleased to reveal that Valheim has surpassed ten million copies sold just over one year since its Steam Early Access release.&quot;
In addition to this, the companies also revealed that Valheim had an all-time player peak of 502,000 – not too mead-iocre at all. In fact, the player numbers were so good, that in just over two weeks, Valheim sold an astounding 3m units.

The new Warzone, which Activision today again described nebulously as an &quot;experience&quot; rather than a fresh update or full sequel, will also be free-to-play. 


It&#x27;s being &quot;built from the ground-up&quot; alongside this year&#x27;s main Call of Duty release, Activision said, which is a sequel to Infinity Ward&#x27;s 2019 Modern Warfare.

                              <span>After a controversial launch and a series of updates focussed on course correction, Gran Turismo 7 got its first proper content drop today, bringing three new cars and a sort of new track into the mix, as well as a suite of fixes and new features. 


Let&#x27;s get the disappointing bit out the way first - the new track on offer is the 24-hour layout of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, which makes bold and daring changes to the layout you&#x27;ll likely know well by…. Changing the position of the start/finish straight. So it&#x27;s the same track you know and love, with Eau Rouge serving as the first corner rather than La Source, but this new configuration inspired by the round-the-clock race does at least suggest extended support of Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s time-of-day feature. 


In terms of new cars, leading the charge is the Subaru BRZ GT300 which was seen challenging and indeed conquering last year&#x27;s Super GT series, and it&#x27;s joined by its road legal offspring the freshly tweaked Subaru BRZ S. For lovers of kei cars there&#x27;s a neat surprise in the diminutive form of the Suzuki Cappucino EA11R from 1991 (you&#x27;ll find it on sale in the used car dealership).

                              <span>Peridot, the next game from Pokémon Go maker Niantic, has begun to roll out via its recently-announced soft launch. 


So far, the cute Tamagotchi-like app has become available in Malaysia - and footage of the game&#x27;s opening stages has been posted online. 


Around 10 minutes of footage from one user reveals Peridot&#x27;s opening tutorial, item shop and a list of possible tasks to increase your creature&#x27;s happiness. These tasks include pointing your phone camera (and therefore your Peridot pet) at specific objects like a flower, a cat or a dog.

                              <span>GSC Game World, the Kyiv-based developer of Stalker 2, has had its website blocked by the Russian government. 


The Stalker 2 website, unsurprisingly, includes a message of support for Ukraine. The developer has also called for an end to Russia&#x27;s brutal invasion of its home country, as it struggles to continue development while Kyiv has been under attack.


Now, the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office of the Russian Federation has blocked access to the website for Russian audiences, removing access to anyone in the country without use of a proxy. The RIA Novosti news agency said the move followed GSC&#x27;s decision to cease business in Russia (thanks, XGP.pl, via VGC).

                              <span>A modder is working to make Elden Ring multiplayer more seamless.


Co-operative gameplay has been a staple of FromSoftware&#x27;s games since Demon&#x27;s Souls, allowing players to summon in help. However, if either player dies they must restart again; and if a boss is defeated, the summoned player will still be booted.


YouTuber LukeYui is now working on a mod that will stop players from being booted out during multiplayer (spotted by TheGamer).

OneMoreGame (via Resetera) shared a letter they had received from Sony about the upcoming change. It reads: &quot;You can easily upgrade to a higher benefit plan at any time. 
&quot;To do so, you&#x27;ll need to pay the difference between the current plan and your new plan, adjusted for the remaining time of your subscription.&quot; However, there is nothing about if it will be as easy to go the other way...

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed maker Ubisoft has attracted early takeover interest from several private equity firms, according to a new report. 
At least two firms are eyeing up Ubisoft ahead of a potential future offer, Bloomberg has reported, though &quot;serious negotiations&quot; are yet to take place. These companies include Blackstone and KKR &amp; Co., two of the world&#x27;s largest in the takeover market.
In a subsequent Kotaku report, sources suggested Ubisoft has been quietly auditing parts of its business over the past year - a potential sign it may be readying itself for a future suitor.

                              <span>Borderlands 3 will once again offer cross-play support for PlayStation players &quot;later this spring&quot;.

It comes almost a year after Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford stated that PlayStation cross-platform support would be cut from an upcoming Borderlands 3 patch without explaining why. The decision was then reversed last month, again without explanation.

Confirmation came by way of the official Borderlands Twitter page, which finally gave us a window - if not yet an exact date - as to when PlayStation players will be able to hook up with their pals on other platforms: spring 2022.

                              <span>Apple has notified developers that apps and games that have gone two full years without an update may be at risk of being removed from the App Store. 

The change comes as part of Apple&#x27;s App Store improvement scheme which aims to make the online shop easier to use and ensure customers &quot;find great apps that fit their needs&quot; that are compatible with newer iOS devices.

In an email to Protopop Games, Apple reportedly said: &quot;This app has not been updated in a significant amount of time and is scheduled to be removed from sale in 30 days. No action is required for the app to remain available to users who have already downloaded the app.

The new position - which will sit within PlayStation Global and, despite the pandemic, insists the successful candidate relocates to California - wants to &quot;bring the best of the PlayStation experiences to markets and channels around the world&quot;, hinting that Sony may be ready to further strengthen its PC presence.

&quot;The successful candidate will be responsible for the strategy and commercial activity within global channel sales and will deliver a single, optimised PC sales growth and commercial plan to hub and territory teams to implement  [and] identifying future sectors &amp; partnerships for commercial growth,&quot; the job ad states (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;The plan should support the delivery of the agreed global channel sales critical metrics.&quot;

                              <span>Koei Tecmo has confirmed its increasing its average basic salary in Japan by 23 per cent.

The increase - which sees the average salary jump by ¥73,000 (that&#x27;s £442) a month - follows similar initiatives by Bandai Namco and Capcom in a bid to attract and retain its staff.

The company has also pledged to boost the starting salary for new graduates from ¥234,000 to ¥290,000 - that&#x27;s a jump from around £1417 a month to £1756 in order to &quot;improve the motivation&quot; and &quot;welfare&quot; of its staff.

The game is in early development and we will keep testing, so for now all you can do is register for upcoming tests.

                              <span>Eve Online subscriptions are going up, including the one-month charge, which is being increased for the first time since 2004.
In a blog post justifying the changes (thanks, PCGN), CCP says the uplift &quot;reflects global trends impacting general productions costs and accounts for years of inflation&quot; and have been introduced in order to &quot;continue investing in Eve Online’s evolution and growth&quot;.

&quot;Since Eve Online’s original launch back in 2003, together EVE’s developers and community have led the charge in evolving what sandbox MMOs can be,&quot; the post explains.

On Friday, Infinity Ward switched out both its Twitter banner and profile icon which - at first blush, anyway - seemed to be solid black logos with no image or text. 

Brightened up, however, and eagle-eyed players think they&#x27;ve spotted fan-favourite character Ghost lurking in the background, sparking whispers that an announcement is imminent.

In recognition of the impact period pain has on some staff, at the time of the announcement GOG said the &quot;experimental&quot; leave &quot;breaks taboos&quot; and is &quot;yet another step towards making GOG an even more inclusive workplace&quot;, but it won’t stop its &quot;continuous efforts to learn, reflect and improve on how we can do better for all of our team members&quot;.

Styled on the variant found in Silent Hill 2 rather than Homecoming or the movies, the 9-inch tall &quot;super-exclusive&quot; statue is officially sanctioned by Konami and comes &quot;with all the finishing touches that fans would expect to see&quot;.

&quot;Straight from the highly acclaimed horror game Silent Hill 2 comes a high-quality statue of the iconic Bubble Head Nurse, a sinister female monster manifested from James Sunderland’s subconscious,&quot; the blurb explains.

                              <span>The release of Halo Infinite&#x27;s co-op campaign has seemingly slipped to August 2022.

The co-op campaign was expected to release next month after it was delayed from the initial launch. However, last month developer 343 Industries acknowledged that it needed &quot;more time&quot; to work on the cooperative campaign and Forge, and cooperative missions would not be available in May as hoped.

Now, in an image on the company&#x27;s latest news update, 343i has revealed the &quot;target&quot; for campaign co-op is August, along with campaign mission replay. The Forge Open Beta is slated for September, but split-screen isn&#x27;t expected until sometime during November&#x27;s Season 3.

                              <span>Activision has revealed what&#x27;s coming up in Call of Duty: Mobile&#x27;s newest season, Wild Dogs, which includes a &quot;brand-new way to play battle royale&quot; via its new mode, Sandstorm.

&quot;There are no good guys, no bad guys, with only nature as the adversary,&quot; a press statement teases. &quot;A sandstorm will appear randomly in wild areas of battle royale. Players entering the sandstorm will be challenged to avoid hurricanes and tornadoes to reach the high-tier loot and special items contained within the weather event.&quot;

Dropping on 28th April at 1am UK time, season 4 also offers two new maps - Cold War&#x27;s Satellite and Modern Warfare 2019&#x27;s Khandor Hideout - as well as new operators, weapons, blueprints, calling cards, charms, and COD Points, plus 50 new tiers of &quot;Battle Pass rewards&quot;.

                              <span>Interesting:
Drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, engineers at the University of California, Irvine invented an adaptive composite material that can insulate beverage cups, restaurant to-go bags, parcel boxes and even shipping containers.
[…]
“The metal islands in our composite material are next to one another when the material is relaxed and become separated when the material is stretched, allowing for control of the reflection and transmission of infrared light or heat dissipation,” said Gorodetsky. “The mechanism is analogous to chromatophore expansion and contraction in a squid’s skin, which alters the reflection and transmission of visible light.”...</span>

The vulnerability, which Oracle patched on Tuesday, affects the company’s implementation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm in Java versions 15 and above. ECDSA is an algorithm that uses the principles of elliptic curve cryptography to authenticate messages digitally.
[…]
ECDSA signatures rely on a pseudo-random number, typically notated as K, that’s used to derive two additional numbers, R and S. To verify a signature as valid, a party must check the equation involving R and S, the signer’s public key, and a cryptographic hash of the message. When both sides of the equation are equal, the signature is valid. ...</span>

                              <span>Lego is now firmly entrenched in the world of video games, what with its sets inspired by the likes of Mario, Sonic, and Minecraft, and that looks set to continue with an official Lego version of the iconic Atari 2600 having now been uncovered for apparent release later this year.


As reported by Promobricks (via VGC), an official Lego version of the Atari 2600 console - which initially released as the Atari VCS all the way back in 1977 - complete with distinctive wooden trim, will arrive this August as part of Atari&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations.


Promobricks says the set - not to to be confused with the fan-made submission on Lego&#x27;s Ideas website - will include a Lego rendition of the console itself (said to be roughly the size of the 1977 original), a replica of the equally iconic CX40 joystick, plus a cartridge of gaming classic Pitfall! fashioned from plastic bricks.

                              <span>Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers have become notorious for their struggles with &quot;drift&quot;, to the point that lawsuits have been launched over the issue, the EU has pledged to investigate, and Nintendo&#x27;s president has even formally apologised. A new report, though, shines additional light on the extent of the issue, claiming that Nintendo&#x27;s US arm was receiving &quot;easily thousands&quot; of faulty controllers a week for repair at the height of the problem.


That&#x27;s according to a new report by Kotaku, which, citing a former supervisor at the Switch repair facility (run by United Radio under contract with Nintendo), claims the volume of repairs got so high - with &quot;hundreds&quot; of faulty controllers arriving each day - that work became &quot;very stressful&quot;, leading to high turnover in the department and &quot;lots of&quot; repair mistakes.


Nintendo&#x27;s initial response to the Joy-Con drift problem, reportedly saw the company providing replacements for customers&#x27; faulty Joy-Cons between 2017 and 2018; however, that policy is said to have eventually changed and repair staff were then required to repair every set of Joy-Cons received. At the height of Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con drift issues, Nintendo&#x27;s repair centre was reportedly receiving “easily thousands&quot; of faulty units each week, necessitating the establishment of new workplace specifically for controller repairs.

And now it&#x27;s delivered, giving the overhauled subscription service a launch target of 22nd June in Europe and 13th June in the US.


That&#x27;s according to an update on Sony&#x27;s official PlayStation Blog which, alongside the target dates mentioned above, also reveals a planned 1st June launch for the new PlayStation Plus in Japan and an even earlier 23rd May arrival in all other Asian markets.


Sony&#x27;s overhauled PlayStation Plus combines elements of its existing PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now subscription services into one, offering three distinct subscription tiers - Essential, Extra, and Premium - each with their own distinct features.

                              <span>Dying Light 2 might have had a rocky road to release, but it looks like the project has paid off for developer Techland; the studio has revealed its zombie parkour sequel has surpassed 5m copies sold across all platforms since its launch at the start of February, with that number reflective of sales as of 28th February and said to be &quot;significantly growing&quot; each month.


By way of comparison, we can look toward Dying Light&#x27;s original instalment, also regarded as a sizeable hit for the studio. That game - according to new figures released by Techland today - has now sold 20m copies since launching a little over seven years ago in 2015, meaning its follow-up really is off to a flying start.


All that suggests a healthy future for Dying Light 2 - doubtlessly reassuring for Techland, given the developer has already committed to five years of post-launch DLC support for the game. Already that promise has brought the likes of new armour, weapons, events, and challenges to the game, with the first bit of substantial post-launch story content scheduled to arrive this June.

                              <span>Wizard duels, potion brewing, and crystal balls will feature in Two Point Campus&#x27;s wizardry course.


As wizardry students advance their magic becomes more powerful, which will be needed not just in duels, but in dealing with ancient curses and nefarious enemies looming about the school.


Though the wizardry course has been spotted in previous trailers, a new course reveal video has given a more detailed look at the classes - you can watch it below.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 will launch for Nintendo Switch on Friday, 9th September, Nintendo has confirmed. 


A new trailer today has showcased its 4v4 online Turf War battle mode across &quot;a mix of new and familiar stages&quot;. Fresh off the boat here is Eeltail Alley, a new level, and the stringer, a bow-shaped weapon type you can fire ink from both vertically and horizontally.


In single-player mode, meanwhile, you&#x27;ll fight the Octarians and &quot;discover the secrets of Alterna and the Fuzzy Ooze&quot;. I have no doubt Splatoon master and Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson is excited by the sounds of that.

This update, and the timing of it, suggests all of these games may well be making their way to Sony&#x27;s upcoming Premium tier subscription package, which promises access to a catalogue of &quot;beloved classic games&quot;. 
The only games in the series to have not been given a rating for modern consoles are Syphon Filter 3 (which originally released for PlayStation on all the way back in 2001), and Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain, which came out on the PlayStation 2 in 2004. 
Below is a table showing these new ratings from the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea (via Gematsu).

&quot;Character animation in the main menu&quot; and &quot;camera controls over the main menu islands&quot; were listed as being part of the Premium Fun Pack DLC or the game&#x27;s Digital Deluxe Edition. The same is true of the game&#x27;s &quot;Hard Missions&quot;.
A bonus listed simply as &quot;Letterbox Background&quot; is highlighted as being available in either the Premium Fun Pack DLC or the separate Start Dash Pack DLC - free but only if you pre-order.

But he is now back again and will be hopping into our lives for a rebooted hurrah on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam) on Friday 27th May. And what will his reboot be called? Well, Kao the Kangaroo, of course.
&quot;We&#x27;ve been blown away by the response we&#x27;ve had from gamers since we announced Kao the Kangaroo was making a return earlier this year,&quot; said Kaja Borowko, head of Kao developer Tate Multimedia. 
&quot;With this new chapter, we&#x27;ve set out to make sure the new Kao the Kangaroo both honours his previous outings and offers fresh, contemporary gameplay for fans new and old alike. This is a complete reboot for Kao, and we can&#x27;t wait to see how people take to it at launch!&quot; You can check out Kao&#x27;s new trailer below.

The case, filed in November last year by ex-PlayStation IT analyst Emma Majo, claimed PlayStation paid women less than men in similar jobs and were held back from promotions. Majo also claimed she had been wrongfully fired &quot;soon after&quot; reporting gender bias. 


In a new ruling, reported by Axios, a judge has now decided much of Majo&#x27;s case lacked necessary evidence.

                              <span>Telltale Games&#x27; brilliant Tales from the Borderlands is getting a sequel of sorts, courtesy of Borderlands&#x27; main developer Gearbox.


The new Tales game will launch this year and feature a fresh cast of characters, Gearbox&#x27;s colourful CEO Randy Pitchford announced on stage at PAX East last night. 


In development for &quot;many&quot; years, the project has been worked on in-house at Gearbox after the developer saw the critical success of the original Tales - and after Telltale itself sadly closed down.

                              <span>One of Elden Ring&#x27;s most difficult bosses has now been made even trickier.


It&#x27;s thanks to a bug in the latest update that causes the infamous Malenia to self-heal when other players are summoned in to help.


The bug was spotted by the now legendary player Let Me Solo Her, who regularly leaves a summon sign outside the boss fight to help those struggling to defeat her.

Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series features HD remasters of Klonoa: Door to Phantomile, first released on PlayStation 1 in 1997 and celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, plus its 2001 PlayStation 2 sequel Klonoa 2: Lunatea’s Veil, both in the same package.


Both games, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, play out as side-scrolling platformers in which protatongist Klonoa, a Dream Traveler (and be-hatted rabbit thing), embarks on an adventure to save their respective worlds.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been an eventful day for long-starved Skate fans; not only did footage from the series&#x27; upcoming fourth instalment leak its way onto the internet, additional details have begun to emerge, with a new report suggesting Skate 4 will let players build skateparks together in free skate mode as part of an emphasis on user-generated content.


That&#x27;s according to the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb, who shared some fresh Skate 4 morsals from his sources during the most recent episode of his Giant Bomb show Grubbsnax. As transcribed by VGC, Grubb began by saying early word on the game appeared to be positive, with those who&#x27;ve played it being &quot;very impressed with the way it feels.&quot;


According to Grubb, EA&#x27;s goal with Skate 4 is to modernise the series while retaining its much-loved skating core, with some of the new features said to be akin to those seen in the likes of Forza or other modern multiplayer games. These reportedly includes ample customisation options for characters - &quot;a lot of skins, skins for your board, things like that&quot;, Grubb explained - as well as user-generated content, which Skate 4 will &quot;really emphasise&quot;.

                              <span>Sci-fi grand strategy game Stellaris&#x27; new Overlord expansion has been given a release date and will be making its way to PC on 12th May, arriving alongside a free update for all players.


Overlord is Stellaris&#x27; sixth major expansion (following on from Nemesis, Federations, MegaCorp, Apocalypse, and Utopia), and brings a range of new options for players as they spread their influence among the stars, this time loosely focussed on empire management.


There are, for instance, new vassalisation mechanics, enabling players to negotiate or demand the terms of their agreements with their new vassals, or even define the specialist role they&#x27;ll play in an empire - either focusing on military might, tech research, or economic acquisition.

                              <span>Retro spruce-up House of the Dead: Remake is making the jump from Switch to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC next Friday, 28th April.


Developed by Forever Entertainment and MegaPixel Studio, which previously collaborated on the similar Panzer Dragoon remake, this updated version of Sega&#x27;s beloved 1997 arcade rail-shooter, delivers all the ludicrous zombie blasting action (and wonderfully awful dialogue) of the original, albeit with a fresh lick of modern-day paint.


Alongside its enhanced visuals, which you can scrutinise for yourself in the trailer below, House of the Dead: Remake also features a new Horde mode that increases the on-screen enemy count, updated controls (what with modern hardware largely being upsettingly lightgun-free), two-player local co-op, a photo mode, gallery, leaderboards, and achievements.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re talking about Microsoft and Sony&#x27;s plans to put advertising in free-to-play games. It&#x27;s a feature commonly found - and widely accepted, if not enjoyed - in free mobile titles, which now seems to be on the way to your PlayStation and Xbox.
It&#x27;s fair to say that few people enjoy advertising and it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;d opt into seeing more of it - but do Microsoft and Sony see this as a way to encourage new, smaller developers into the console space? Of course, a lot depends on how these plans are implemented - and here we chew over a few ways that could be worse than others.
Finally, to lighten the mood, we have a chat about Amy Hennig&#x27;s return to the Star Wars universe and the sheer number of upcoming games set in the galaxy far, far away we now have to look forward to. Apex Legends developer is making three, alongside projects from Quantic Dream, Ubisoft and others. Joining me to discuss all that are Eurogamer reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan!

                              <span>Square Enix has revealed Outriders Worldslayer, a massive expansion to the original Outriders game. 


Featuring a brand-new campaign story, Worldslayer contains higher gear level caps, new gear, a new difficulty mode and a gigantic new end-game. 


The story campaign is standalone from the original game, with players facing a new Altered enemy, Ereshkigal, who wields an unnamed new power.

                              <span>When Rockstar announced that West-coast rapper Dr Dre would be starring in his own campaign in Grand Theft Auto Online, very few expected him to release a whole EP of music in the game. 


To put it into context, Dre hadn&#x27;t published any new music since his last album, Compton, back in 2015. 


So just how did Rockstar convince one of the greatest rappers in history to play such a large role in a video game?

                              <span>F1 has entered its new era in fairly convincing fashion, with the 2022 season delivering some great action and a revised order - and now, as the circus rocks up at Imola for the start of the European season EA Sports has lifted the lid on this year&#x27;s model of the official game. 


F1 22, as it&#x27;s monikered, will of course feature all the tracks and new cars of the new season, alongside tweaked physics to take into account the ground-effect enabled cornering speeds of the new breed. It&#x27;ll also offer the debut of the new Miami circuit, as well as a refined race day experience that offers both &#x27;Immersive&#x27; and &#x27;Broadcast&#x27; modes, with the former putting an emphasis on you making the big decisions while the latter allows for a more relaxed experience. 


Perhaps most significantly for long-running players of the series VR support will finally be available on PC for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift players.

Frogwares, the Ukrainian developer behind the game, shared a statement stating that the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game were held back to improve optimisation.


However, thanks to the amount of work and the impact of the war, the Xbox One version has been put on hold indefinitely. Anyone with a pre-order on Xbox One can receive a full refund.

Originally developed by Jordan Weisman&#x27;s Harebrained Schemes, the turn-based cyberpunk trilogy first arrived for PC between 2013 and 2015. Mobile versions have also been available - but never console editions. Until now!

&quot;Lost Boys is an incredible studio with industry-leading talent that continue to push the bar higher for what gamers expect from their favourite franchises,&quot; said Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford.
&quot;I am excited for Chase, Rod, Shaun, Mark and my old friend Tim, along with all of the incredible talent at Lost Boys, to have an immediate and positive impact on the games secretly in development at Gearbox Software [Borderlands 4??].

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s games are selling so well, the publisher has revised its earnings forecast.


Last year, it released the likes of Resident Evil: Village and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, both of which exceeded sales expectations and are cited by Capcom as a direct reason for the forecast revision.


Additionally, the release of Monster Hunter Rise on PC earlier this year - previously exclusive to the Nintendo Switch - has proven the &quot;stable popularity of catalogue titles&quot;.

Kazumasa Habu, producer for Digimon Survive shared the news on YouTube last night. &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting for updates on Digimon Survive,&quot; he said. &quot;But today I would like to provide you with this exciting news. The release date of Digimon Survive has finally been fixed for July 29, 2022.&quot;
He then goes on to say that there will be even more &quot;exciting news&quot; coming our way in &quot;all forms&quot;, so, something to keep an eye out for.

Exploding Kittens - The Game will launch via Netflix next month, as the latest mobile title available to subscribers. 


An Exploding Kittens adult animated series is also on the cards, with Lucy Liu and Lucifer star Tom Ellis attached to provide voices. That project won&#x27;t arrive until 2023, however.

Fortnite has played host to countless Marvel characters before, of course, typically timed around their appearances on the big screen or TV shows (the current battle pass includes Doctor Strange, while we were treated to Hawkeye and Kate Bishop late last year). 


Moon Knight&#x27;s rather fetching skin includes a style with/without his cloak, and an additional style for his Mr. Knight persona. (We won&#x27;t get into story details here, in case you&#x27;re yet to start the new series.)

That&#x27;s according to Variety, which reports the It Takes Two movie is now set for &quot;priority development&quot; at Amazon Studios, with dj2 Entertainment still producing the movie, and Dwayne Johnson&#x27;s Seven Bucks Productions (Jumanji, Jungle Cruise) also on board.
Johnson will apparently serve as a producer, and Variety says its sources claim Johnson may also star in the movie, although &quot;nothing is official as of now&quot;.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s acclaimed Medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is setting its sights on Spain and Portugal for its next DLC, the Fate of Iberia Flavour Pack, which arrives on 31st May alongside a big free update for all players.

Core to the DLC - which aims to give players the opportunity to &quot;truly decide the fate of the [Iberian] peninsula, either by reenacting history or creating an alternative that pleases you more&quot; - is a new system that Paradox is referring to as the Struggle, said to highlight the &quot;unique historical circumstances that typify regions that have been centres of conflict&quot; and &quot;create new opportunities and add constraints&quot; for players in the Iberian peninsula.


Fate of Iberia will include an updated map for the region - refining the county and duchy divisions, as well as cultures and faiths - alongside new events (some specific to Iberia and others adding variety for all players), new Urbane and Coterie Legacy tracks, new Cultural Traditions, plus new friend interactions and duels.

                              <span>Following reports earlier this week that Microsoft is considering introducing ads to free-to-play games on Xbox, a new report has surfaced claiming Sony has been working on its own plan to do the same with its PlayStation games.


As reported by Business Insider (paywall), which cites three people involved with Sony plans as its sources, the company is currently investigating ways to encourage developers to continue making free-to-play games - said to have soared in popularity during the pandemic - by providing new ways to monetise them.


At present, PlayStation&#x27;s ad inventory is said to be limited to in-menu ads - which can be used by publishers and developers to do things like promote their own games on the PlayStation Store - and ads served via streaming video on certain apps.

Let&#x27;s put it this way, when the Saints Row team said the customisation will cover &quot;all aspects of player choice in the game&quot;, they really meant it.  
Everything from your teeth to your car&#x27;s horn can be made just the way you want. You fancy fangs? Go for it.

Ghostbusters VR

Ghostbusters VR (working title, if you were wondering) brings the 80s movie classic to virtual reality as a four-player co-op adventure promising an &quot;extensive and engrossing&quot; spirit-bothering campaign. Players will need to track, blast, and trap ghosts as they protect San Francisco from the unearthly realm, with developer nDreams aiming to deliver &quot;all the humour and frights from the beloved franchise&quot; when Ghostbusters VR eventually arrives at some currently undisclosed future point.

                              <span>Resident Evil 4&#x27;s Mercenaries mode arrives today as part of the Meta Quest 2 version of Capcom&#x27;s classic, via a free update with brand new content made specifically for this VR version. The announcement came via the just-finished Meta Gaming Showcase event - and you can play the mode for yourself now, or watch our Ian try it for himself just below.

Mercenaries, a wave-based PVE mode found in several Resident Evil titles, is a fan-favourite - and not least in Resident Evil 4, where you face hordes of ganados against the clock while attempting to land a high score. But this fresh version of Mercenaries for Meta Quest 2 includes an array of new options and unlockable extras - including online leaderboards and 20 Challenges which mix up Mercenaries&#x27; gameplay in new ways.
Challenges include options which restrict gameplay to just knives or rocket launchers, or shroud the map in fog. Complete these, and you&#x27;ll gain access to other all-new additions such as a Big Head Mode, speedy Fast Forward mode, and a black-and-white Classic Horror Mode for the main Resi 4 campaign.

                              <span>Developer Ludeon Studios&#x27; widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim RimWorld has had its Refused Classification status rescinded in Australia following a successful appeal, meaning its effective ban in the region has been overturned.
The notoriously sensitive Australian Classification Board initially refused to grant RimWorld a rating in March after its publisher Double Eleven Limited submitted the game for an upcoming &quot;multi platform&quot; launch, prohibiting it from release and effectively banning it from sale. The decision even affected the long-available Steam version of RimWorld, preventing new purchases from being made on Valve&#x27;s digital store.
No specific reason was given for the board&#x27;s decision at the time, with its website only referencing its usual boilerplate copy for games refused a rating, saying RC titles are those that &quot;depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified.&quot;

News of an open world Metroid game surfaced last year when Bryan Walker, senior producer on Metroid Prime 2 and 3, mentioned the idea on the Kiwi Talkz podcast, as previously reported.


However, speaking to YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming, new details have surfaced.

&quot;Have you left an Easter egg in Destiny for your new IP? I would be disappointed if there wasn&#x27;t,&quot; one fan asked via Twitter (thanks, GamesRadar). &quot;Yes,&quot; Barrett replied. &quot;Maybe :)&quot;

In a recent episode of The Kardashians (titled &quot;Burn Them All to the Fucking Ground&quot;), Kim was shown to be upset and confused when her son, Saint West, alerted her to his find. 
When Saint explained the ad was in a Roblox game, Kim immediately responded, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s a game? Then we&#x27;re suing them if it&#x27;s a game with my name and picture.&quot; Kim then stated that the ad in question claimed to have additional unreleased footage of her 2007 sex tape in it.

                              <span>Halo music composer Marty O&#x27;Donnell has said his lawsuit against Microsoft over unpaid royalties has now been &quot;amicably resolved&quot;. 

Eurogamer revealed details of the legal action from O&#x27;Donnell and fellow composer Mike Salvatori back in February, in which the pair claim they are owed credit and compensation for Microsoft&#x27;s continued use of Halo music over the past two decades. 


An upcoming court date had been set - something this new development sounds like it will now avoid.

Let Me Solo Her rose to fame recently helping players defeat Malenia, one of the game&#x27;s trickiest bosses. 


Online, players can summon others to assist in their own game. Let Me Solo Her regularly left a summon sign outside the Malenia boss fight to aid players struggling with the battle - a testament to goodwill in the Elden Ring community.

That&#x27;s the question answered by YouTube channel 64 Bits with its latest video that blends the two games together in a beautiful demake.


The video reimagines BioWare&#x27;s classic sci-fi epic as a top-down strategy title. Sadly it&#x27;s not actually playable, but it&#x27;s wonderfully crafted.

Both Nintendo and its hiring company Aston Carter are named in the complaint, uncovered by Axios, which was filed with the US National Labor Relations Board in Washington state, where Nintendo&#x27;s North American business is headquartered. 


Exact details of the complaint have not been made public, though the complaint highlights several general categories in which Nintendo and Aston Carter are alleged to have been at fault.

If you prefer to use Sony&#x27;s DualSense controller during your PC sessions, but a lack of PS5 console is holding you back from purchasing one, we have great news - you now no longer need to own a PlayStation 5 to update a DualSense controller. Huzzah!
&quot;PC players can now update their DualSense wireless controller with the latest firmware from Windows 11 and select Windows 10 devices, without connecting to a PS5,&quot; Sony announced today. 
In order to do this, you will need to download the Firmware updater for DualSense wireless controller app (catchy name) to your Windows PC. When this app is loaded, all you will then need to do to get all the latest updates on your controller is use a USB cable to connect said controller to your PC, and then just follow the on-screen instructions and you&#x27;re away.

As we previously reported, a wall in Volcano Manor was discovered that seemed to be a secret illusory wall, though it ultimately led nowhere particularly interesting.



It seems, though, that this was just a glitch after all. Souls YouTuber Zullie the Witch tested the wall after the new patch and found it no longer breaks.

                              <span>Everyone learns in different ways. Some methods work super well for one person, while someone else just doesn&#x27;t &quot;get it.&quot; While most of us know this intellectually, it&#x27;s easy to forget that other people aren&#x27;t all like we are. I&#x27;m speaking in this case, of course, about myself.

A clever hacker used a “flash loan” feature  of another decentralized finance project to borrow enough of the currency to give himself a controlling stake, and then approved a $182 million transfer to his own wallet.
It is insane to me that cryptocurrencies are still a thing.</span>

                              <span>Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey, the gorgeous diorama puzzler from developer Light Brick Studio, has made the leap from iOS to console, and is now available to purchase on PS4 and PS5.
Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey, which originally launched as an Apple Arcade release toward the end of 2019, is, conceptually, a fairly simple thing, tasking players with building a path across a selection of beautifully presented Lego dioramas so their little Lego pal can push onward.
Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan was quite taken with Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey&#x27;s breezy, tactile charms at the time, and spoke highly of its &quot;meditative, contemplative tapping and twisting and reworking and rethinking&quot; in his write up.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nearly five months since the troubled Marvel&#x27;s Avengers last received a new playable character - the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man - but there&#x27;s finally good news for those wondering when the drought might end: developer Crystal Dynamics has confirmed another superhero is on the way, this time in the form of Jane Foster, the Mighty Thor.


Details on Foster&#x27;s video game iteration are limited at this early juncture in Crystal Dynamics&#x27; reveal, but the developer has confirmed the character will have &quot;a lot in common&quot; with the version of Thor already in-game. Don&#x27;t expect a carbon copy, however; &quot;elements that are distinctly Jane&quot; are also promised for her eventual arrival.


Exactly when that might be, though, is unclear. Crystal Dynamic offered no timeline for the new playable character in its recent blog post, only confirming Foster will release as part of Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; 2.5 update and that more details will be shared &quot;in the future&quot;.

                              <span>Gearbox has detailed Coiled Captors, the first DLC expansion for Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, which will see players attempting to liberate an old god from its icy prison when it arrives this Thursday, 21st April.


More specifically, Coiled Captors sends players on an adventure deep inside an icy mountain - where they&#x27;ll find &quot;wintery wastelands, arid ruins, and flooding caverns&quot; - and it&#x27;s here they&#x27;ll be tasked with freeing an old god from within the body of a mighty shark-like seawarg, via the time-honoured Borderlands tradition of killing it to death.


Gearbox describes Coiled Captors - which can be accessed via Vesper&#x27;s first Mirror of Mystery - as a &quot;repayable dungeon challenge&quot;, explaining that as well as dealing with fierce resistance from the snake-like members of the Coiled, a secretive sect that worships ancient gods, players will need to tackle the four powerful forms of the DLC&#x27;s captive old god, Chums.

                              <span>Blizzard has detailed World of Warcraft&#x27;s next expansion, Dragonflight, which will be taking adventurers on a journey to the long-lost Dragon Isles, and introducing a new playable race-class hybrid and flyable dragons along the way. Additionally, the developer has confirmed 2008&#x27;s Wrath of the Lich King expansion will come to World of Warcraft Classic later this year.


First, Dragonflight, which grants access to the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind, the Dragon Isles, recently reawakened following a period of calamity for Azeroth. This new region - described as lush and primal, bursting with elemental energy - will incorporate everything from icy wastes and magma areas to lush forests and vibrant coasts across its four standard areas (bringing the likes of new dungeons and raids) and new starting zone. 


The Dragon Isles starting area is home to the Dracthyr Evokers, a new playable race-class hybrid that will begin their WoW journey at level 58 and can align with either the Horde or the Alliance. Evokers will have two customisable forms - their draconic avatars used in battle, plus humanoid forms deployed when interacting with Azeroth&#x27;s inhabitants - and, depending on players&#x27; chosen class specialisations, can either focus on damage dealing or healing.

                              <span>Nolan North, the man behind roguish hero Nathan Drake, has shed more light on the departure of Uncharted creator Amy Hennig from Naughty Dog during the making of A Thief&#x27;s End. 
North was a guest on Couch Soup this weekend, as hosts Liam McIntyre and Todd Lasance began their playthrough of Uncharted 4. Just before the opening sequences began rolling, North was asked more about how this final version of the game came about. Clearly not wanting to shy away from the elephant in the room, North went straight into chatting about Hennig, and the changes made after she left the game&#x27;s development.
&quot;The biggest thing most people probably remember is... we had shot Uncharted 4 with Amy Hennig for about seven months. We were well into the game. And she was dismissed from Naughty Dog... and they got rid of everything we did,&quot; North recalled.

                              <span>Uncharted creator Amy Hennig is returning to the Star Wars universe to work on a new &quot;richly-cinematic action-adventure game&quot;. 


Hennig, memorably, spent three years working on Project Ragtag, the ill-fated Star Wars game left &quot;on the shelf&quot; by EA after developer Visceral Games was shut down. 


The project is the second major game in the works at Skydance New Media, Hennig&#x27;s new studio, which is also working on an unannounced action-adventure game based around a Marvel property.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s tutorial is now impossible to miss thanks to the game&#x27;s latest update.


Some players missed the tutorial entirely as it required you to intentionally fall down a hole: something that feels like trolling. Elden Ring has drawn plenty of newcomers to the Soulsborne games, so missing the tutorial meant a particularly tough start.



Now players are greeted with an unmissable prompt as they approach the precipice where the tutorial takes place, as verified by Eurogamer.

Spotted by Reddit user JayProspero (thanks ArsTechnica), the Captain Spacetoy action figure has been altered in the in-game arcade. Originally it wore hot-pink and had &quot;interchangeable genitalia&quot;; now it&#x27;s an alternative outfit with &quot;posable vomit direction&quot;.


Further, Rockstar has removed the trans caricatures that would spawn outside of the Cockatoos nightclub.

                              <span>Nintendo has announced a release date for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 - and it&#x27;s coming sooner than expected. So update your diary, as the new launch date for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is 29th July. 
In addition to this news, Nintendo also shared a new trailer for the game, showing off the battle system and new story info. 
In Xenoblade Chronicles 3, players will &quot;step into the roles of protagonists Noah and Mio amid turmoil between the nations of Keves and Agnus. Six characters hailing from those nations join forces to learn the truth behind their conflict, and set their sights for Swordsmarch, a land pierced by a giant sword.&quot; This trailer takes a look at the background to the group&#x27;s journey in Aionios and can be watched below.

                              <span>Portal co-writer Erik Wolpaw has called for Valve to put a third game in production soon - before the original development team becomes too old to return.


&quot;I am not getting any younger,&quot; Wolpaw told KiwiTalkz (thanks, Kotaku). &quot;We are reaching the point where it&#x27;s crazy to think [the original development team is] literally going to be too old to work on Portal 3, so we should just do it.&quot;


Unfortunately, Wolpaw acknowledged the business considerations of Valve focusing a chunk of its workforce on a Portal 3 - especially when the company had the money-printing Steam and hugely successful Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to run instead.

                              <span>After years (and years) of silence that led many to assume the Monkey Island brand had fallen by the wayside, original creator Ron Gilbert announced a return to its tropical isles earlier this month in the aptly named Return to Monkey Island. Now, Gilbert has also revealed his new game in the series will start off where Monkey Island: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge finished – at an amusement park.
&quot;One of the things that was very important to me about this was that I did want the game to start right at the end of Monkey Island 2, when you walk into that amusement park. I wanted the game to start there,&quot; Gilbert told Adventure Gamers.
&quot;That was kind of my one criteria: we need to start the game there. I don&#x27;t want to go into all the details of it, but we do start there, and then it takes lots of weird twists and turns that you would expect from us.&quot;

                              <span>Elden Ring players are getting soft banned for picking up pants dropped by other players.

As previously reported, players discovered a cut pair of underwear in the game. The Deathbed Smalls were meant to be part of the NPC Fia&#x27;s armour set, but are unobtainable without hacking the game.


But hacks and mods cannot be used without by-passing the game&#x27;s anti-cheat system. And simply owning the pants - even if obtained by another player - is seemingly enough to trigger a soft ban.

                              <span>Sega is eyeing a big-screen outing for its classic side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up series Streets of Rage, Deadline has reported. 


A script for the film adaptation has been written by Derek Kolstad, creator and lead writer for the hugely-lucrative John Wick franchise. 


Sega is reportedly keen to replicate the film success of its Sonic the Hedgehog series, and has tapped the same production company, dj2 Entertainment, to now work on Streets of Rage too.

                              <span>Jason Momoa, known for his hulking and somewhat imposing roles in Game of Thrones, Dune and Justice League, is on the cusp of landing his newest role. But this time, it seems the muscular lead will be taking on a much blockier persona than we are used to seeing, as The Hollywood Reporter has reported Momoa is currently in &quot;final talks&quot; for Warner Bros.&#x27; live-action Minecraft adaptation.
While his part is not set in stone (cuboid or otherwise), it certainly looks hopeful. So, will he be Steve, or a whole new hero? Or even, the villain? I guess we will have to wait and see.
Along with some potential Mamoa-ness, Variety has additionally revealed the upcoming Minecraft film has also landed Napoleon Dynamite&#x27;s Jared Hess as its director. Meanwhile, Dune producer Mary Parent will produce the film, alongside Roy Lee.

Bloomberg states these projects are the first to come from Sega&#x27;s myserious &quot;Super Game&quot; initiative - and that two more, one a first-person shooter, are also in the works. 


Development on all the above is still early, with Crazy Taxi reportedly still &quot;two to three years&quot; away despite being in development for &quot;over a year&quot; already.

                              <span>The latest patch for Elden Ring is now live, bringing a whole host of small changes.


Patch 1.04 has improved stability of gameplay and made a large number of balance tweaks to weapons, sorceries, and weapon skills. It also adds an option to change camera auto-rotation and some additional event phases for the NPC Patches.


In particular, the attack speed of colossal weapons has been increased to make them a more viable option for pure melee builds.

Interviewed by Kinda Funny Games, Krueger was asked by Greg Miller for his thoughts on the difficulty of Returnal and its impact on accessibility.


&quot;I think we can always do more, could always add more support for different ways to play the game and different control methods and so on. I think when it comes to difficulty, I think it is a question of what kind of experience you are having with Returnal,&quot; said Krueger.

So, I guess that is that.

Specifically, Nintendo-made emulators codenamed Hiyoko (for Game Boy) and Sloop (for Game Boy Advance) have been detailed as part of a new datamine. 


To date, there&#x27;s been no official word on Game Boy emulation for Nintendo Switch, though Eurogamer previously reported that it was being worked on by Nintendo.

                              <span>New paper: “Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models:
Abstract: Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate “backdoor key”, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees. ...</span>

                              <span>Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda has detailed how he expects the game developer and publisher will capitalise on blockchain technology in a new interview.  

Matsuda intimated that traditional game development, especially in the domestic Japanese market, is now &quot;not enough&quot; for the company, adding that he wants to &quot;utilise the power of [autonomous game content] to create games that will continue to evolve&quot; and use blockchain tech to incentivise any such user generated content.

&quot;In the future, we would like to try our hand at providing ‘autonomous game content’,&quot; the president told Yahoo Japan (as translated by VGC).

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14 producer and director, Naoki Yoshida, has apologised for ongoing issues with the MMORPG&#x27;s new housing lottery system that&#x27;s preventing players from winning any land.

In a post on the game&#x27;s official website, Yoshida outlined what the team was doing to address the problem in which players are being told their bids were unsuccessful because there &quot;were no participants in this lottery&quot;, or that the winning number is &quot;0&quot;... even though no players can be assigned that number.

&quot;We understand that this is a major issue, and are prioritising our investigation into the matter,&quot; Yoshida said. &quot;We are working to identify the issue in the corresponding program; however, as the process is very complex and there are many patterns involved for the lottery conditions, it will require some time to pinpoint the problem.

As spotted by TechRadar, according to SteamCharts - a site that, predictably enough, charts the performance of games on Steam - the global concurrent player count for the new game dropped to just eight players on Wednesday 13th April. Its highest ever peak sits at just 1166 players. 

In the last 30 days, the average player count has been just 137 simultaneous people.

In a YouGov survey issued to players over the weekend, Activision Blizzard - which is in the process of being acquired by Microsoft - asked players how &quot;interested&quot; they were in a range of &quot;emerging/future trends in gaming&quot;.
Amongst standard innovations in the gaming industry, such as VR and AR, AI, cross play, and game subscription services, the company also sought players&#x27; views on more controversial topics such as &quot;metaverse gaming experiences, play-to-earn gaming (earn cryptocurrency, NFTs, or real currency) [and] NFTS (non-fungible tokens)&quot; (thanks, GameRant).

                              <span>Prolific dataminer Lance McDonald has discovered a deleted NPC questline in Elden Ring.

According to McDonald, if you visited Stormhill Shack - which had previously been known as Scavenger&#x27;s Shack and is today the location where you&#x27;ll meet Roderika - during the network test, it was empty. Before that test, however, it looks like it was the home to an unknown NPC called Monk Jigo.

As spotted by PC Gamer, Jigo had been &quot;seduced by the good lady alcohol&quot; and needed your help to gather the ingredients for Dreambrew, a magical booze that, shared with other NPCs, would unlock bonus dialogue.

                              <span>An update to the Steam backend has fans speculating that Among Us VR may be released in December 2022.

While this is by no means definite - even the SteamDB listing, which leaked the date, clearly states that the &quot;Steam API release date [...] may be wrong&quot; - the update was changed on 15th April 2022, amended from 10th November to 13th December, 2022 (thanks, PCGN).

While either date could be a placeholder, of course, the good news is that we probably don&#x27;t have to wait that long to find out exactly what the release date will be; Innersloth has confirmed it&#x27;ll be at Facebook&#x27;s Meta Quest Gaming Showcase this coming Wednesday, and the hope is we&#x27;ll find out one way or the other then. We&#x27;ll keep you posted.

Launching on 19th April, Unshackled will include the return of Flashpoint, where the ability to regenerate health and shield is removed, along with healing and shield loot. Instead you must get to Flashpoint zones to regen health although, as you may well expect, you may have to fight for control of it…

There&#x27;s also the usual new themed cosmetics  - badges, charms, skins, and the like - and new weekly challenges to take on, too.

&quot;Our favourite otaku assassin returns!&quot; tweeted XSeed games. &quot;Travis Touchdown has been forced out of retirement to defend not only Santa Destroy, but Earth itself! Bring on the beam katana and take on Travis&#x27; toughest challenge yet in No More Heroes 3, coming this fall to PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC!&quot;

As yet there&#x27;s been no word on a specific release date, but right now we can expect it sometime autumn 2022 - or Q3, if you&#x27;re in the southern hemisphere, of course.

                              <span>You can now hunt Easter eggs as well as ghosts in the latest Phasmophobia update. 

Hotfix 0.6.1.3, which is available now, introduces &quot;bug fixes and a weekend Easter event&quot; with every location hiding &quot;several Easter eggs to hunt and find&quot;. 

But it&#x27;s not just a meaningless holiday activity; collect all the eggs in every location - you can track how many you have beneath the map in the truck - and you&#x27;ll restore each team members&#x27; sanity to 100 per cent, too.

                              <span>Child of Light director Patrick Plourde is the latest senior developer to announce they are leaving Ubisoft after almost 20 years at the company.
The creative director - who has also worked on Watch Dogs 2, Far Cry 3, and Rainbow Six Vegas - announced his departure earlier this week, and confirmed he&#x27;s moving on to form his own &quot;independent creative consultancy&quot;.

&quot;R6 Vegas, AC, FC3, CoL, WD2... it’s been a privilege to collaborate with everyone at Ubi on these great games!&quot; Plourde tweeted.

                              <span>China is reportedly stepping up its regulations around streaming &quot;unauthorised&quot; video games.

As reported by Reuters (thanks, PC Gamer), Chinese government agency The National Radio and Television Administration has justified the move by insisting that &quot;for a period of time, issues such as chaotic online livestreaming and teenage addiction to games have raised widespread concerns in society and effective measures need to be taken urgently&quot;.

The statement seemingly comes after some fans were able to view games China deems as &quot;unauthorised&quot; - such as Elden Ring - via Chinese streaming platforms, even though many are not available to buy in the country.

However, at the end of the update, the team confirmed that there are no additional patches planned &quot;at the moment&quot;, and thanked players for &quot;the incredible amount of support and feedback&quot; it has received.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima has shot down rumours that Kojima Productions may be acquired by PlayStation.

It was Sony itself that sparked speculation after a ResetEra user noticed that the banner topping PlayStation Studios&#x27; website had been updated to include Sam Bridges from Kojima&#x27;s Death Stranding game. 
The banner also included a shot of Bluepoint&#x27;s Demon&#x27;s Soul remake, which was acquired by Sony last year. Despite the fervour, the banner has not been taken down, suggesting its change was neither premature nor accidental.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly considering adding advertisements to its free-to-play games.


That&#x27;s according to Business Insider, which reports that Xbox is looking to offer advertisment revenue to &quot;developers who make free-to-play&quot; games.



&quot;One of the sources speculated Microsoft isn’t currently interested in collecting a cut of ad revenue because it wants to provide more money-making opportunities to developers who make free-to-play games,&quot; the publication said, as transcribed by our sister site, VGC.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion is drawing ever-nearer to its June release on PC and Switch, and, in anticipation of its eventual arrival, Capcom has offered a closer look at its new Citadel map and new armoured monkey monster Garangolm in action.


Come Sunbreak&#x27;s release, players will have the opportunity to depart for new climes, with the bustling port town of Elgado Outpost serving as the expansion&#x27;s colourful new hub area. From there, it&#x27;s just a short hop to Sunbreak&#x27;s brand-new map, The Citadel - which combines a diverse range of biomes, including lush forests, icy mountains, and foggy swampland, with a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece.


Capcom describes The Citadel - said to be a once thriving, but now devastated part of the kingdom, slowly being reclaimed by nature - as a &quot;key location&quot; for Sunbreak&#x27;s new Master Rank quests in its video showcase, taking viewers on tour of the castle and its surroundings biomes, as well as offering a glimpse of the location&#x27;s new endemic life.

                              <span>With season 3 of Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher adaptation now officially in production, the streaming service is beginning to loosen its lips about what&#x27;s in store, and that includes casting news for four characters being introduced as part of the series&#x27; third outing.


Netflix confirmed filming on season 3 was officially underway earlier this month, sharing a behind-the-scenes shot of the show&#x27;s Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri (that is, Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan) on-set and in the snow. It also offered a brief summary of where things will be heading following the conclusion of last season, revealing that it&#x27;ll see Geralt taking Ciri of Cintra into hiding.


&quot;Entrusted with Ciri’s magical training,&quot; the streaming service explained, &quot;Yennefer leads them to the protected fortress of Aretuza, where she hopes to discover more about the girl’s untapped powers; instead, they discover they’ve landed in a battlefield of political corruption, dark magic, and treachery.&quot;

                              <span>Following recent claims developer Criterion&#x27;s new Need for Speed game could be launching as soon as November, it&#x27;s now been reported the racer will be set in a fictional version of Chicago and will combine a &quot;photo-realistic&quot; art style with &quot;anime elements&quot;.
That&#x27;s according to VentureBeat’s Jeff Grubb, who discussed the long-awaited project in the latest episode of his Grubbsnax show. Elaborating on his claims the new Need for Speed would &quot;be photo-realistic, but it’s going to have on top of that, anime elements&quot;, Grubb (as thanks VGC) explained, &quot;You know when you see a car commercial or something like that and the car’s driving around, but then cartoons flames and stuff are flying off it? That’s the kind of the aesthetic that they seem to be going for.&quot;
Away fron Need for Speed&#x27;s new visual style, Grubb also claimed the racer will take place in a fictionalised version of Chicago, known as Lake Shore City, and that various familiar features would be returning for this latest Need for Speed instalment. These are said to include Autolog and its multiplayer focused social tools, plus the ability to &quot;customise all the pieces of your car&quot;.

                              <span>As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has confirmed Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s previously announced paid expansion - which the developer says will deliver a &quot;new storyline&quot; - is now expected to arrive next year, and that additional DLC is in the works.


Details on Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s paid story expansion have remained limited following CD Projekt&#x27;s decision to switch its development focus to fixing the base game in response to its disastrous launch at the tail-end of 2020. The developer had originally intended to discuss its expansion plans prior to the game&#x27;s release, meaning additional information is long overdue.


Mentions of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s expansion have been sporadic at best since launch, but it seems CD Projekt is now ready to discuss it in slightly more definite terms, with the developer confirming, unsurprisingly, that it&#x27;ll feature a &quot;new storyline&quot;, and that it&#x27;ll be launching in 2023. That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s saying for now, however, with more information due to be shared &quot;later this year&quot;.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re taking stock of some of the games we&#x27;ve played this year so far. 


Inspired by Eurogamer&#x27;s best games of 2022 so far list, and ahead of a long weekend of gaming here in the UK, now&#x27;s a good time to chat about what has kept us interested this spring. 


Horizon: Forbidden West arrived with huge fanfare, and seems like it did a good job of providing more of the original&#x27;s sense of adventure - but did it fall a little flat in the face of Elden Ring? January saw the launch of the new PS5 version of Uncharted: Lost Legacy - but what&#x27;s next for the biggest of Sony&#x27;s blockbuster franchises?

                              <span>Amnesia: Rebirth, the third outing in developer Frictional Games&#x27; historical horror series, will be next week&#x27;s free Epic Store game, alongside couch-based co-op dungeon-crawler Riverbond.


Rebirth - which follows on from Frictional&#x27;s 2010 original and its Chinese-Room-developed successor A Machine for Pigs - whisks players back to the 1930s for an unsettling adventure across the Algerian desert. This time around, the focus is on protagonist Tasi Trianon as she attempts to navigate the sandy, hostile expanse, piecing together fragments of her past (and occasionally dealing with unspeakable horrors) along the way. 


Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake called Rebirth an &quot;impressive horror subversion&quot; and a story that &quot;gripped me right up until the credits rolled&quot; when she reviewed it back in 2020, so it&#x27;s an outing that&#x27;s well worth your time - and there&#x27;s even an Adventure Mode that cuts back on the suffocating darkness, jump scares, and deadly monsters for faint-hearted players that just want to dabble in its puzzling and engaging story.

                              <span>The release date of Call of Duty Warzone and Vanguard&#x27;s new season has been announced with a new cinematic trailer that appears to hint the arrival of something more sinister. 


Season three, Classified Arms, is set to release on the 27th April with the franchise&#x27;s connected universe storyline progressing with the release of &quot;Nebula bombs&quot; by the Nazis. 


But the cinematic trailer also teases something bigger: &quot;With Nebula, the Nazis had unwittingly shaken something awake, something far more powerful and fearsome than anything we could ever hope to comprehend.&quot;

                              <span>Scarlet Nexus has seen its player base boosted by a million players from Xbox Game Pass, publisher Bandai Namco said today. 
The announcement came as the game passed the two million player figure overall - with the other million coming from 1m copies shipped to retailers and sold digitally (thanks, RPGSite).
It&#x27;s intriguing to see the RPG gain such a large reach through Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service - at a time when the power of being included in these has been under the spotlight. The action RPG was added to Game Pass back in September last year.

PlayStation Trophy data for this new addition has been detailed in a new video from Access the Animus, which suggests based on prior release timings we should see the new content go live within the next couple of weeks.


Dubbed &quot;Mastery Challenge: The Reckoning (Part 2)&quot; this is expected to add fresh combat challenge maps to rinse and repeat for high scores, and hopefully some closure to what the mode&#x27;s vendor Hildiran is really up to.

In a statement given to a Club Penguin fan blog, Detective Constable Daryl Fryatt, from the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU), said &quot;Following a complaint under copyright law, PIPCU have seized a gaming website as part of an ongoing investigation into the site.&quot;


The statement continues: &quot;Three people were arrested on 12th April on suspicion of distributing materials infringing copyright and searches were carried out. They have been released under investigation and to aid with the police investigation, they agreed to sign over the website to the control of PIPCU.&quot;

Season 02: Rival Escalation will arrive via Steam on 28th April and for PlayStation and Xbox on 5th May. A new, free season pass will unlock fresh cosmetic rewards for your dwarven character - including beards and helmets.

The Chinese-language video originated on YouTube before being shared by popular Overwatch personality (coach and streamer) Stylosa.
In it, we get a HUD-less montage showing what Sojourn - Overwatch&#x27;s first black female character - can do. We see her dual-purpose gun, which has what looks like a machine-gun primary fire and a railgun alternate fire. And judging by the video, the railgun is deadly and potentially passes through enemies too.

                              <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s player count has dropped below that of Halo: The Master Chief Collection for the first time on Steam.


The franchise&#x27;s latest title, which was released late last year, has steadily shed its player base as it became frustrated with the lack of content updates in addition to ongoing issues surrounding the game&#x27;s monetisation. 


As it currently stands, The Master Chief Collection had a peak player count of 9123 over the past 24 hours, in contrast to the 7842 players on Halo Infinite.

                              <span>The Department of Energy, CISA, the FBI, and the NSA jointly issued an advisory describing a sophisticated piece of malware called Pipedream that’s designed to attack a wide range of industrial control systems. This is clearly from a government, but no attribution is given. There’s also no indication of how the malware was discovered. It seems not to have been used yet.

                              <span>Developer DICE is readying to launch a major new update for Battlefield 2042, with the beleaguered shooter&#x27;s 4.0 release promising to deliver &quot;400+&quot; fixes and improvements when it arrives some time next week.


Although full patch notes won&#x27;t be available until next week&#x27;s launch, DICE community manager Kevin Johnson (thanks VGC) has shared some of the release&#x27;s key features on Twitter. Attachments will, for instance, receive an overhaul in Update 4.0, with DICE aiming to ensure all feel unique and have an impact on loadout choices and gunplay.
Additionally, XP for Support Actions and Teamplay has been balanced &quot;to ensure teamwork remains king&quot;, and there are balancing changes arriving for Vehicular Warfare in a bid to give Infantry/Vehicle counter play &quot;some bite&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re hankering for some additional letter-based puzzling to fill the void between your daily bursts of Wordle, Mattel and developer Scopely might well have the answer - as the grandaddy of word games, Scrabble, is given brand-new web version to mark what is apparently this year&#x27;s National Scrabble Day in the US.


Scrabble Web, as this new online version of the classic word game is sensibly and unfussily known, delivers all the letter-plopping thrills of the board game original, albeit it in a free, easily accessible new digital guise. And while it might be relatively low on frills right now, it does at least feature a fairly solid range of options when it comes to ways to play.
For starters, there&#x27;s a solo mode, pitting players against an AI opponent, but also some competitive PvP for those that prefer to test their word prowess against living, breathing challengers - be they randoms or friends - all served up in selectable flavours of match length, lasting between 3 and 45 minutes.

                              <span>The Witcher 3&#x27;s long-awaited PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed indefinitely following CD Projekt&#x27;s decision to move its development in-house.
An enhanced version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC - which would include the base game and its various expansions - was initially announced in September 2020, with CD Projekt promising to deliver the likes of ray-tracing and faster load times. All this would be made available as both a standalone version and as a free upgrade to those that already owned the game on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
It was a generous offer, but very little has been heard of the project since, with CD Projekt only intermittently mentioning it - usually in conjunction with word of another delay - as it continued its attempts to manage the fallout from Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s disastrous launch.

                              <span>Niantic&#x27;s next game involves caring for and breeding fictional creatures - but it&#x27;s nothing to do with Pokémon. Instead, Peridot is a brand new creation by Niantic itself - the company&#x27;s first for many years - and one it&#x27;s aiming at an even wider audience.


With Peridot, Niantic seems to be gunning for the now-vacant Neopets market (RIP Neopets), with cutesy Pixar-esque characters, Tamagotchi-style gameplay and - because this is a Niantic game - a good old nudge every so often to get you off your sofa.


&quot;We want it to be a standalone pet simulation game,&quot; producer Ziah Fogel told Eurogamer this week via Zoom call, when asked why it was building a new app separate to Pokémon Go. Niantic&#x27;s mission here, she continued, was to iterate on and improve the popular pet simulation genre. You&#x27;ll be able to try it for yourself soon, too - it arrives in soft launch in certain countries within the next few weeks.

                              <span>The California Department of Fair Employment&#x27;s ongoing harassment and discrimination lawsuit against Activision Blizzard - which accused the publisher of fostering a &quot;frat boy culture&quot; in which sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has taken another dramatic turn. A state of California lawyer involved in the lawsuit has resigned, accusing the state&#x27;s governor of interfering in the case in support of Activision Blizzard.


As reported by Bloomberg, the assistant chief counsel for California’s Department of Fair Employment, Melanie Proctor, has quit her role in protest after California Governor Gavin Newsom &quot;abruptly fired&quot; the agency&#x27;s boss, Chief Counsel Janette Wipper. A representative for the two attorneys has since confirmed the firing and resignation to Bloomberg.


In an email to staff seen by the publication, Proctor claimed Governor Gavin Newsom and his office had begun to &quot;interfere&quot; with the Activision lawsuit in recent weeks. “The Office of the Governor repeatedly demanded advance notice of litigation strategy and of next steps in the litigation,” Proctor wrote. “As we continued to win in state court, this interference increased, mimicking the interests of Activision’s counsel.”

Previously held in-person in Dallas, Texas, the impact of the pandemic means this won&#x27;t be possible, at least for this year.


The convention will take place digitally from 18th - 20th August.

The UK regulator had been investigating all of the big three console manufaturers, though Microsoft opted in January to get ahead of its findings and role out changes to Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass worldwide.


Now, Nintendo and Sony will also alter their services to offer better guidance for customers, as reported today by GamesIndustry.biz.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered how Evil Dead’s Ash Williams would fair in the snow-covered world of Resident Evil Village? Well, wonder no more, as someone has brought these two pieces of media together as one, and I won’t lie, it is a match made in (a far from angelic) heaven. 
Using footage from 1987’s Evil Dead 2 and 1992’s Army of Darkness, content creator eli_handle_b․wav has replaced Resident Evil Village protagonist Ethan Winters with Ash. The results are both horrifying and amusing all in one. 
Instead of ripping himself free from Lady Dimitrescu’s clutches a la Ethan, this rendition of Village sees new hero Ash instead shimmying up to his towering captor and offering to open a bottle of champagne (I mean, someone was going to do it eventually, just look at her).

In fact, according to a new interview with IGN, it was his love of EverQuest that led to the development of Final Fantasy 11 - the series&#x27; first foray into online gaming.


&quot;My first [MMORPG] was EverQuest. I got absolutely addicted to it and forced a dozen or so SquareSoft staff members at the time to play as well, telling them it was required knowledge. Incredibly, most of them got hooked too, which led to [Final Fantasy 11],&quot; he said.

                              <span>While many see the inclusion of their game on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus service as a real boon, others feel less so. In fact, Oddworld Inhabitants&#x27; Lorne Lanning has revealed that getting Oddworld: Soulstorm on PS Plus was &quot;devastating&quot; for the team.
Chatting to Xbox Expansion Pass, Lanning said his team initially thought they would sell roughly 50k units of Oddworld: Soulstorm, and certainly no more than 100k. The studio was also looking for some financial help to keep the game alive, and as such, when Sony approached the team offering an undisclosed amount of money to put its game on PS Plus for its release month, Lanning jumped at the chance. 
However, the game&#x27;s release was delayedby three months due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. And with the game&#x27;s later release, Lanning said, more people than previously estimated now had access to a PlayStation 5.

                              <span>Scalpers are reportedly targeting stock of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga - and specifically its Deluxe Edition physical pack which includes an exclusive Lego minifigure.


The minifigure in question is Luke Skywalker, albeit with a unique look - he&#x27;s chugging down on a carton of his favourite blue milk, and has a frothy-looking milk moustache. 


Unfortunately, this cute toy has caught the attention of scalpers looking to resell the figure for plenty of credits on its own. You can&#x27;t get this version of the minifigure anywhere else - and this is driving up its price on eBay (thanks, Nintendo Life).

                              <span>Chernobylite developer The Farm 51 is &quot;heartbroken&quot; at current events in Ukraine.


Speaking to PressPlayNews, studio creative director Wojciech Pazdur discussed the war, as well as the future of the game.


&quot;This war, like any other, is an unnecessary violence which takes lives of innocent people and forces millions to flee and abandon their homes while those who stayed have to fight for their lives during the humanitarian crisis,&quot; he said.

                              <span>World of Warcraft maker Blizzard is polling fans of the franchise on what they&#x27;d like to see offered in the somewhat-inevitable Wrath of the Lich King Classic.


Options in the marketing survey obtained by Wowhead include digital toys, pets and mounts, as well as character transfers, level boosts and game time. 


Several price points are mentioned, including $50 (£38) and $30 (£23) options.

                              <span>One scientist has answered the question surely on everyone&#x27;s minds since The Elder Scrolls 5 released over a decade ago – just what would Skyrim&#x27;s skeletons look like if they were alive today? Well, it turns out, they would look like disgruntled cavemen.
Thanks to facial reconstruction technology, Twitter user Sulkalmakh from the Ancestral Whispers cranial reconstruction research team brought Skyrim&#x27;s bony boys to life, as it were.
In a playful tweet from April Fool&#x27;s Day (via IGN), the user shared their &quot;Facial reconstruction of an ancient Atmoran from Saarthal, dated to the late Merethic Era&quot;. This may well have gone over the heads of many, but eagle-eyed fans were soon quick to realise that the face staring back at them on the screen was indeed that of a (now fully fleshed) Skyrim Skeleton.

The move contrasts with recent pushes from companies such as Call of Duty maker Activision and League of Legends studio Riot Games, who seem keener to get staff back in offices - leading to Covid safety concerns. 


Bungie has said it will allow remote work from a number of US states (likely due to local tax laws - thanks, Kotaku) including the developer&#x27;s home of Washington, plus others including California, Florida and Texas.

Those listings are for a planner and two visual artist positions, one of which specifies work to &quot;perform HD remastering of the 3D background&quot; (thanks google translate).

Certain Affinity has assisted with Halo development as far back as Halo 2, where it worked on extra maps for that game. Subsequently, it has served as a co-developer for 343 on Halo Waypoint, Reach, Halo 4 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.


Its continued work on the series with Halo Infinite comes as little surprise, then, but the language it has used - and an earlier report on what it might be up to - point to a major addition to Infinite coming from Certain Affinity in the future.

In a trailer for its new, and free, community &#x27;Plague&#x27; event, Devolver Digital wrote, &quot;Reports are rolling in from across the Weird West of a plague of undead rising from the grave! Worse, a terrible sickness seems to follow in their wake. Stay sharp, travelers.&quot;
So, yes, Hollywood may have given us Cowboys vs Aliens already, but now its time for Cowboys vs Zombies! You can check out the new trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been itching to turn to the darker side in No Man&#x27;s Sky, developer Hello Games&#x27; exploratory space sim has you covered in its new Outlaws update, giving players the chance to trade their life of relatively wholesome interplanetary meandering and base building for one of rather more criminal pursuits as they take on the role of fearsome space pirates.


Just as February&#x27;s Sentinels update sought to improve ground combat, Outlaws aims to do the same for space combat. That means better ship handling, shields for enemy starships, plus visual enhancements and various specialist secondary effects for weapons. The latter for instance, might give players the ability to slow enemy engines or disable their shield systems. Additionally, combat can now move down into a planet&#x27;s atmosphere and AI pirates can even attack your settlements - and if all that sounds a little intimidating, Hello Games has introduced a new Auto-Follow mode to improve combat accessibility.


Elsewhere, there&#x27;s a brand-new class of ship in the form of the sleek, solar-powered, and rather unimaginatively named Solar Starship (plus the maximum number of ships players can store has now been increased to nine), and it&#x27;s now possible to create squadrons, recruiting and upgrading AI wingmen, each with their own unique abilities, for assistance in battle. Oh, and all ships now have high-capacity (and expandable) cargo inventories for specialist goods.

                              <span>A Russian cyberweapon, similar to the one used in 2016, was detected and removed before it could be used.
Key points:
ESET researchers collaborated with CERT-UA to analyze the attack against the Ukrainian energy company
The destructive actions were scheduled for 2022-04-08 but artifacts suggest that the attack had been planned for at least two weeks
The attack used ICS-capable malware and regular disk wipers for Windows, Linux and Solaris operating systems
We assess with high confidence that the attackers used a new version of the Industroyer malware, which was used in 2016 to cut power in Ukraine

                              <span>Blizzard has provided additional details of next week&#x27;s World of Warcraft expansion reveal, confirming the event - previously announced to be airing on Tuesday, 19th April - will commence at 5pm BST/6pm CEST/9am PT/12pm ET.


&quot;World of Warcraft has ignited imaginations through rich storytelling and expansive worlds that prevail throughout the Shadowlands expansion,&quot; Blizzard wrote in an its announcement of today&#x27;s news. &quot;From the hopeless depths of the Maw to the ethereal plains of Zereth Mortis, the Shadowlands delivers a world that challenges heroes to confront the forces that threaten to upset the cosmic balance between life and death. With the story in the Shadowlands coming to a conclusion, the time is at hand to get a sneak peek at what’s next for the heroes of Azeroth.&quot;


As for what maybe next for the long-running MMO, that&#x27;s still somewhat unclear, but Warcraft-focused website Wowhead reports (thanks VGC) that data found in the source code of the official World of Warcraft website suggests the new expansion will be called Dragonflight, with Base, Heroic, and Epic Expansion pre-pruchases seemingly set to become available following next week&#x27;s reveal.

                              <span>Last March, John Wick director Chad Stahelski announced he was working on a movie adaptation of PlayStation samurai adventure Ghost of Tsushima, and now, a little over a year later, a writer for the project has been named.
As reported by Deadline, the new Ghost of Tsushima film adaptation will be penned by Takashi Doscher, who previously wrote and directed romantic sci-fi romance, Only, alongside ESPN documentary A Fighting Chance.
Deadline says the adaptation is still in &quot;early development&quot; and, as such, details remain scarce. However, the publication previously confirmed the project - a collaboration between Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions - will, perhaps unsurprisingly, follow the adventures of game protagonist Jin Sakai. Will there be Hot Spring butt? Only time will tell.

                              <span>Beamdog, the developer perhaps best known for its remasters of Black Isle Studios classics such as Baldur&#x27;s Gate and Planescape: Torment, has unveiled MythForce, a new first-person fantasy rogue-lite inspired by the Saturday morning cartoons of the 80s.
First things first, MythForce looks kind of glorious, doing an admirable job of capturing the ambiance of any number of 80s cartoon favourites, albeit rendered in full 3D. There&#x27;s a definite air of the fondly remembered Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#x27; animated outing about it, for instance (with a little bit of arcade cult-classic Dragon&#x27;s Lair thrown in), which is entirely fitting given Beamdog describes its game as a first-person swords &amp; sorcery adventure.
At MythForce&#x27;s core is a roguelite dungeon-crawling experience that sees up to four co-op players - in the role of either Victoria the valiant Knight, Rico the charming Rogue, Maggie the wise Mage, and Hawkins the deadly Hunter - storming a colourful cartoon castle packed with &quot;treasure, traps, and terrors&quot;. Beamdog is promising to arm players with &quot;legendary weapons and powerful magic&quot; as they attempt to survive the forces of evil within.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s late-game bosses are tough, so what better way to ease the pain of FromSoftware latest epic than by cutting out the middle man and getting one boss to fight another boss on your behalf? We&#x27;ve already had one such showdown before, pitting Malenia against Starcourge Radahn (and his pal Leonard the horse), and the victor of that skirmish is now back, this time taking on Maliketh, the Black Blade.


This latest battle of Elden Ring&#x27;s elite comes courtesy of the Garden of Eyes, the same modder that bought Malenia face to face with Radahn (and that also pitted Bloodborne&#x27;s Lady Maria against Resident Evil Village&#x27;s Lady Dimitrescu), this time promising the &quot;ultimate battle of the Shardbearers&quot; and delivering a whole lot of pyrotechnics as the two fight it out.


Those who&#x27;ve yet to enter the gauntlet of carefully curated misery that makes up Elden Ring&#x27;s final stretch will obviously want to steer clear of Garden of Eyes&#x27; latest head-to-head for obvious spoiler reasons, but those eager to see who reigns victorious this time around simply need to watch the video below.

But wait, there’s more. Not only will new players be welcomed onto the whimsical shores of Snaktooth Island, home to the game’s titular snack and bug hybrids, they will also get their hands on the game’s brand new DLC - The Isle of Bigsnax - on the very same day. For those who have already been playing Bugsnax through PlayStation and Epic, don’t worry. This DLC will also be coming to you at the same time.
In this new DLC, players will be sent to a mysterious new island that has risen up from the depths of the sea. And, as you may have already guessed by its name, here players will come across a new range of supersized bugsnax to capture. You can check out the new trailer for The Isle of Bigsnax below.

Hines&#x27; appointment comes after a year of damaging headlines which have shone light on Activision Blizzard&#x27;s company culture, including numerous allegations of misconduct and abuse.


Controversial Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick - who remains in place, at least while the company&#x27;s sale to Microsoft is finalised - welcomed Hines&#x27; hiring today.

The PC mod in question comes from Opulent Halo (via PC Gamer). While the mod is actually a few months old now, many have been recently diving back into Halo Infinite to see how Master Chief (at least his video game form) looks from this new angle. Perhaps Paramount has whetted some appetites?
In a video showing off the mod in action, the creator wrote, &quot;after my novice modding skills in Halo Infinite, I wondered what third person would look like... [spoiler alert] it&#x27;s amazing&quot;.

That&#x27;s exactly what YouTuber Flurdeh has done. Using camera tools by Frans Bouma, they&#x27;ve used a tilt shift lens and isometric view to create a video of the Lands Between from above (thanks PC Gamer).


Though not a full mod, it somewhat reimagines the game as a CRPG, Miyazaki&#x27;s bleak world becoming adorable little dioramas with tiny model enemies shuffling around.

Technically it&#x27;s an Ashe of War called Ground Slam but let’s be real: it&#x27;s a butt stomp.


Spotted by PC Gamer, the streamer has a highlights video of the run up on YouTube that shows the butt slamming route to victory.

                              <span>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have lifted the curtain on their new action-adventure IP, Hell is Us. 
In a joint press release, the companies gave a brief and somewhat haunting synopsis for the game. &quot;The almost total self-sufficiency of the country hides a dark secret: the recent appearance of supernatural creatures resembling ancient headstones and monuments in the region,” the Hell is Us team explained. &quot;The citizens call this phenomenon &#x27;the Calamity&#x27;. Armed with weapons specially forged to fight these monsters, the protagonist must learn how to defeat them and use his equipment wisely.&quot;
To accompany this announcement, a new teaser for Hell is Us was also debuted. This trailer gives off strong Kojima vibes, and shows off the game&#x27;s dystopian country, which is ravaged by civil war. In the words of Ed Nightingale, &quot;It’s like Death Stranding with a sword&quot;. You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>A new update for Halo: The Master Chief Collection has added &quot;experimental&quot; cross-platform co-op for both Halo 3 and Halo 3: ODST.


The feature will let anyone on PC, Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S play these games&#x27; campaigns co-operatively online together.


In patch notes, developer 343 Industries said the cross-play had been tested internally - though the company now needed &quot;additional insight from real players with different networking setups&quot;. If you experience issues, you&#x27;re encouraged to report them so 343 can improve the feature further.

                              <span>Nintendo will expand its Kyoto headquarters with a new 10,000 square metre building next door to its existing sites.


The Mario maker has already stumped up the $40m required to purchase the land, on which it will build a new 12-storey office which will expand its notoriously-secretive research and development work.


The new building (red in the diagram below) will sit next to other Nintendo buildings (in pink) and be open by the end of December 2027 (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). Maybe we&#x27;ll have Switch 3 by then?

                              <span>Wingspan, the rather lovely digital adaptation of Stonemaier Games&#x27; equally lovely bird-themed board game, will be ushering a fresh flock of avians into its welcoming habitats from 5th May, come the launch of its first major gameplay DLC, the European Expansion.


Wingspan&#x27;s European Expansion builds on the core game&#x27;s soothing, strategic deck building - which Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese was rather taken with when he first put it through its paces some time back now - by introducing 81 new bird cards from the European area, each accompanied by a recording of its actual sound.


These new birds will bring a range of fresh abilities for use during play - such as the option to steal other players&#x27; food, to place cards on already played cards, and to reset the bird feeder - and you&#x27;ll find a little more in the way of specifics on the official European Expansion website.

                              <span>Capcom has confirmed a sequel to its Arcade Stadium retro compilation is on the way - consisting of 32 more classic titles - after references to a follow-up were spotted on the South Korean game classification website earlier this month.


Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium, as the sequel is known, will follow the same modular release model as its predecessor, consisting of a free base download that includes one game and offering additional titles to purchase from within the collection. Quite why Capcom has decided a sequel is necessary, given the modular, expandable nature of the original, is currently unclear.


&quot;The second Capcom Arcade Stadium title featuring a recreated arcade full of authentic cabinets to play&quot;, is how the publisher describes the sequel in a reference on Steam, promising &quot;a new lineup of masterpieces!&quot;. And in a seperate tweet, it&#x27;s now confirmed that lineup will total 32 arcade classics when it comes to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC this June.

                              <span>New figures show that player numbers for DICE&#x27;s Battlefield 2042 keep on falling, with less than 1000 concurrent users playing via Steam this morning.
A thread on ResetEra revealed that as few as 979 players were shown to be taking part in the game on Steam earlier today, with a peak of 2411 players in the last 24 hours. In comparison, 2018’s Battlefield 5 had a peak of 20,913 players over the same 24-hour period.
These numbers are pretty dire for such a relatively new game, especially one in such a longstanding series, but at this point aren&#x27;t a surprise. After all, in November, Vikki reported that Battlefield 2042 was one of Steam&#x27;s worst-reviewed games of all time, with one user stating the game&#x27;s “issues are endless”.

                              <span>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is off to a superb start in the UK, judging by boxed sales figures from its launch week provided by numbers company GSD. 


TT Games&#x27; epic compilation of all nine films is the UK&#x27;s second-biggest boxed launch of the year so far, behind Pokémon Legends Arceus. 


This means The Skywalker Saga sold more physical copies in its launch week than Elden Ring and Gran Turismo 7, though it&#x27;s worth putting all that in context.

Wander around Mos Espa&#x27;s back alleys and you may encounter Nobot, an odd-looking C-3PO lookalike, who shuffles off into a hovel. Follow him at your peril.
Once inside the area - labelled as &quot;Haunted Hovel&quot; - you&#x27;re treated to a weird one-off moment with Nobot himself - and likely left wondering what the heck just happened.

                              <span>Another day, another Elden Ring speed running record to be left in awe by. And this time, it is a sub-10-minute run. In fact, it is so good, it is actually a sub-nine run, but that didn&#x27;t sound quite as catchy.
This new record was achieved by Distortion 2, who has previously achieved and broken many other Elden Ring speed running records. This included the game&#x27;s first sub-20 run in March.
20 minutes now seems like eons for the streamer, as their new record is an impressive 8 minutes and 56 seconds. This was achieved by using a Zip Glitch, which YouTube commentor Sketchy explains as being performed by &quot;guarding and then walking at a specific time afterward for a specific number of frames. These are frame perfect.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid on PS1 originally had Solid Snake befriending rats.


According to a new video by YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming (narrated by David Hayter no less), game director Hideo Kojima wanted to add more rats into the game, allowing the player to assign them names and raise them as  pets.

Rats were apparently the first life forms Snake encounters in the cold of Alaska, and would play an important role in the game.

Twitter user Killtheth uploaded a series of posts, giving a small insight into the game&#x27;s opening and tutorial section (thanks, Nintendo Life).
&quot;Finally getting to play Advance Wars, but only on my Switch Lite which had preloaded it prior to what happened,&quot; Killtheth wrote, with an accompanying snapshot of the game&#x27;s welcoming dialogue.

                              <span>Fresh from its BAFTA Games win for Music, PlayStation has released a new video detailing the music of Returnal&#x27;s Ascension DLC.


Presented by Glen Andrew Brown from PlayStation Studios Creative Arts Music team, the video highlights how composer Bobby Krlic and the team heighten tension the higher Selene climbs in the endless Tower of Sisyphus.


Specifically, every music track has been composed and edited into all twelve musical keys so that every time Selene moves up a floor of the tower the music rises by a semitone.

Watch Dogs Tokyo&#x27;s first installment launches tomorrow, 12th April, and involves series&#x27; usual evil megacorp Bloom up to no good again.

The news comes courtesy of Soulsborne fan, modder and streamer Lance McDonald, who has delved into Elden Ring to discover content cut from the final build.


The network test build of the game from last year included a number of sleeping enemies that were cut from the final game. McDonald uses this version to test out the mechanic.

PSA: the following article contains spoilers for Elden Ring, so if you are still making your way through the Lands Between and have yet to get to Wailing Dunes, this is your cue to find a different article to while away the time with. 
So, to the matter in hand. It turns out you can actually cheese the boss fight with Elden Ring&#x27;s mighty General Radahn. At least, you can cheese it once you get his health whittled down to 50 percent, which is admittedly still a task in its own right.

Eagle-eyed fans have found what they think is the foot of an AT-ST walker - the chicken-legged tanks most famous from their appearance in Return of the Jedi. 


Fittingly, this scene appears to be placed in a forest area - which looks very like the forest moon of Endor. Hey! Maybe this means Kingdom Hearts 4 will get Ewoks too?

Within a few years of Bitcoin’s arrival, academic security researchers — and then companies like Chainalysis — began to tear gaping holes in the masks separating Bitcoin users’ addresses and their real-world identities. They could follow bitcoins on the blockchain as they moved from address to address until they reached one that could be tied to a known identity. In some cases, an investigator could learn someone’s Bitcoin addresses by transacting with them, the way an undercover narcotics agent might conduct a buy-and-bust. In other cases, they could trace a target’s coins to an account at a cryptocurrency exchange where financial regulations required users to prove their identity. A quick subpoena to the exchange from one of Chainalysis’ customers in law enforcement was then enough to strip away any illusion of Bitcoin’s anonymity...</span>

                              <span>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has allegedly enjoyed the greatest opening weekend for any video-game based movie. Ever.

According to Comicbook, the sequel has clocked up an impressive $71 million - that&#x27;s £54.4m - since its premier on Friday; for context, the first Sonic the Hedgehog movie grossed $58m (£44m) on its opening weekend.

Interestingly, this makes it Jim Carrey&#x27;s biggest domestic opener ever, eclipsing 2003&#x27;s Bruce Almighty which grossed $68m during it&#x27;s opening weekend in the States. It also marks Paramount&#x27;s fifth number-one movie of the pandemic, too.

In a livestream, CD Projekt Red&#x27;s quest director, Pawel Sasko, confirmed that the team was aware that there is still &quot;work to be done&quot;, and said he was reviewing possible new review quests &quot;daily&quot;. 

&quot;We&#x27;re still improving the game, because we are all aware that there is work to be done&quot;, Sasko said in response to a question in the chat (thanks, Reddit via TheGamer).

&quot;We&#x27;re seeking a Senior Narrative Designer to work with us to help shape the next game in the Subnautica universe!&quot; developer Unknown Worlds tweeted earlier this week. &quot;Come and join our fully remote studio and let&#x27;s make great games together.&quot;

In an interview with Sega Japan’s recruitment website and translated by our friends at  VGC, several Sega executives explained that to qualify under the Super Game banner, the new projects must be &quot;multi-platform, global multi-language development, simultaneous worldwide release, and AAA titles&quot;. 


&quot;In other words, you can imagine that the scale of game development will be that of a global blockbuster,&quot; Sega explained.

RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios&#x27; widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, was refused classification in Australia last month, preventing its release and effectively banning it from sale.


As Matt posited at the time it wasn&#x27;t a particularly surprising decision given the Australian Classification Board is notoriously sensitive around certain issues in games, and RimWorld is, after all, a simulation whose incredibly deep systems make drug-fuelled cannibalism an entirely legitimate pastime for colonist.

As reported by Kotaku, PlayStations users have taken to social media on discovering that the hitherto unknown &quot;expiration dates&quot; on their digital games have reportedly expired. 
When trying to re-download the classic version of Chrono Cross, one user reports he received a noticed telling him that his licence to play the game had expired on 31st December, 1969.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a month since Valve started shipping its sought-after handheld system, Steam Deck, and to celebrate, the company wants you to know exactly how far the system - and its games - have come, including updates on its Deck Verified program and ongoing efforts with Microsoft to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to the mobile platform, too.


&quot;We started shipping Steam Deck just one month ago, and it’s been a huge thrill seeing it out in the wild in players’ hands,&quot; Valve explained in a new blog. An accompanying video can be viewed below, too:

                              <span>Scientists are now debating whether octopuses, squid, and crabs have emotions. Short answer: we don’t know, but can’t rule it out.
There may be a point when humans can no longer assume that crayfish, shrimp, and other invertebrates don’t feel pain and other emotions.
“If they can no longer be considered immune to felt pain, invertebrate experiences will need to become part of our species’ moral landscape,” she says. “But pain is just one morally relevant emotion. Invertebrates such as octopuses may experience other emotions such as curiosity in exploration, affection for individuals, or excitement in anticipation of a future reward.”...</span>

Motherboard requested records mentioning AirTags in a recent eight month period from dozens of the country’s largest police departments. We obtained records from eight police departments.
Of the 150 total police reports mentioning AirTags, in 50 cases women called the police because they started getting notifications that their whereabouts were being tracked by an AirTag they didn’t own. Of those, 25 could identify a man in their lives — ex-partners, husbands, bosses — who they strongly suspected planted the AirTags on their cars in order to follow and harass them. Those women reported that current and former intimate partners­ — the ...</span>

                              <span>Digital Extremes has finally set a date for Warframe&#x27;s Angels of the Zariman expansion, with the free-to-play sci-fi shooter&#x27;s first big update of 2022 coming to all platforms on 27th April.


Angels of the Zariman focuses its multitude of new additions around the lore-critical Zariman Ten Zero, an Orokin ship that vanished during a Void-Jump accident. Front and centre of the update is a new instalment in Warframe&#x27;s single-player, story driven Cinematic Quest saga, which this time sets the scene by taking Tenno aboard the Zariman Ten Zero.
Then, once the mission is complete, players will gain access to Chrysalith, a new social hub onboard the Zariman, which introduces a range of new NPC, side missions, and objectives.

                              <span>Tired of those infernal video games, always insisting on being so darned interactive? Well, developer Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology) has you covered in its next horror title The Quarry, which comes with its very own Movie Mode.


Movie Mode, just as it sounds, lets players (or rather viewers, in this instance) watch the entirety of The Quarry&#x27;s summer-camp-flavoured horror in linear, non-interactive fashion - meaning you can simply plop your bot on the sofa, grab your popcorn with two controller-free hands, and soak up its scares with only minimal exertions from yourself.


As detailed in a new IGN preview (thanks PC Gamer), The Quarry&#x27;s Movie Mode will come in three different flavours: Everybody Lives, Everybody Dies, and Director&#x27;s Chair. The first two are pretty self-explanatory, determining whether The Quarry&#x27;s cast members - including the likes of Lance Henriksen, Grace Zabriskie, David Arquette, Ted Raimi, Justice Smith, and Skyler Gisondo - manage to survive their experience at Hackett&#x27;s Quarry summer camp to live another day.

There wasn&#x27;t a lot of news for Fortnite players - at least, not on the surface. 


But eagle-eyed Fishstick fans did subsequently spot something: a brief glimpse at a list of Fortnite file names left open on a strategically-placed Epic Games computer. Zoom in and you can make out references to &quot;Vader&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

                              <span>Criterion&#x27;s new Need for Speed game, which was delayed at the start of last year while the studio assisted the development of Battlefield 2042, will reportedly launch this November, skipping previous game consoles to instead focus on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

 
EA confirmed a new Criterion-developed Need for Speed game was in the works at the tail-end of 2020, slapping it with a vague release window of somewhere between April 2021 and the end of March this year. However, that launch was later delayed to EA&#x27;s fiscal year 2023, with the publisher announcing it had made the decision to move Criterion away from Need for Speed to help DICE &quot;deliver the best [Battlefield] experience possible to our players&quot;.


With Battlefield 2042 now launched, Criterion&#x27;s attention has reportedly returned to Need for Speed, with EA said to be looking to release its long-awaited racer this November. That&#x27;s according to VentureBeat&#x27;s Jeff Grubb who, speaking in the latest episode his GrubbSnax show (thanks WCCF Tech), also claimed this latest series instalment will forego a console release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, instead targeting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

But it remained unclear how well the game had performed commercially, and in February, publisher Square Enix said the title had &quot;undershot expectations&quot;.
Ahead of the BAFTA video game awards last night, I sat down with members of the Guardians of the Galaxy team to discuss the game&#x27;s emotional storytelling, where the series could go next - and some unexpected tussles with racoons. 
But first, the issue of those sales - on which, the team said it had &quot;no regrets&quot;.

Twitter user Nick C spotted the change and shared it online. Looks like Baby Pac has also been changed.

                              <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s second season, Lone Wolves, has been teased via a new trailer. 
The new season, set to arrive on 3rd May, will contain &quot;new maps, modes, themed limited-time events, and an all-new Battle Pass,&quot; the video&#x27;s description states. 
Last weekend, 343 community director Brian Jarrard said the studio understood some fans were &quot;simply out of patience&quot; with the game&#x27;s various frustrations, and that his team was &quot;certainly not happy to be unable to meet player and community expectations&quot;. However, some of these should be addressed as part of the new season, he added.

                              <span>Just in time for Easter, Square Enix is launching a Hatching-tide event in its MMORPG, but a certain emote is causing debate.


As part of the event, various items and minions will be available to collect, as well as an emote for eating an egg.


A picture of the emote shows a cute little Lalafell eating an egg, but the egg still has half the shell on. Which begs the question: how are you meant to eat a boiled egg?

Speaking to Eurogamer, the actress behind Returnal main character Selene Vassos and Hitman&#x27;s Diana Burnwood  discussed the tension between being a parent and having a career.



&quot;I think that&#x27;s very unique, and kudos to Housemarque. I think they took a risk, they could have had a younger gal, or they could have had a man, but no,&quot; she said.

After revealing the face of Master Chief (AKA actor Pablo Schreiber) in its premiere episode, the series&#x27; third slice has now unveiled his naked bottom.


Fans have expressed surprise at seeing their suited hero standing in the butt, sorry, buff during the episode screened last night via Paramount+ in the US. (The show remains unavailable to watch in the UK.)

Capcom, via the Resident Evil Twitter account, released four pieces of artwork, each revolving around Nemesis.


We see him on a table in an Umbrella lab, hooked up to various tubes and with technicians in hazmat suits making notes.

The trademark, spotted by Twitter&#x27;s Renka and shared by the ever-watchful Nibel, is being paired with the Tactics Ogre remaster that appeared on last year&#x27;s infamous GeForce Now leak.


Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together first launched on the Super Famicom in Japan in 1995. It later came out on the Sega Saturn and, in the west, the PlayStation. It was remade for PSP in 2010.

                              <span>Returnal developer Housemarque is hopeful the game&#x27;s arrival on PlayStation Plus will help it find a bigger audience.


Speaking to Eurogamer last night at the BAFTA video game awards, Housemarque managing director Ilari Kuittinen said it was &quot;brilliant&quot; that Returnal will be added to Sony&#x27;s forthcoming revamped subscription service.


&quot;As you know, it&#x27;s been a while since the release. And we know the people who get into [subscriptions] play a lot,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Metroid Dread now offers three boss rush modes, thanks to today&#x27;s free game update. You&#x27;ll gain access to the first after completing the main game&#x27;s story.


The standard Boss Rush lets you fight 12 bosses one after the other, with damage from each carried over to the next. Weapons are fully restored, however.


Your aim here (apart from at the boss&#x27; weakpoints!) is to down each boss as quick as possible. If Samus is downed herself then you&#x27;ll be able retry your current boss fight, but incur a time penalty.

Almost 1100 staff will benefit from the change from 1st January - although this will not apply to staff at Call of Duty studio Raven who are currently seeking unionisation. 
Activision has said it is &quot;prohibited from making new kinds of compensation changes at Raven at this time&quot; due to &quot;legal obligations under the National Labor Relations Act&quot; (thanks, The Verge).

                              <span>MultiVersus gameplay has leaked online and, unsurprisingly, the game looks a lot like Smash Bros.


The near five-minute gameplay clip is live now on vk.com, and looks like it was captured from a recent restricted test, given the black bars that block an identifying watermark from showing on-screen.


We see a raft of characters from the Warner Bros. character pile in action, including Wonder Woman, Batman, Harley Quinn and Velma.

                              <span>BAFTA has announced the 2022 winners of its annual Games Awards, with developer Housemarque&#x27;s sci-fi shooter rogue-like Returnal leaving the show most laden, having taken home the gong across a grand total of four categories, including one for Best Game.
Alongside that Best Game award, Returnal came top in BAFTA&#x27;s Audio Achievement amd Music categories, while Jane Perry scored a win in the Performer in a Leading Role category for her portrayal of Returnal protagonist Selene Vassos.
Returnal wasn&#x27;t the only multi-award winner, however; Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart successfully beat the competition in BAFTA&#x27;s Animation and Technical Achievement categories, while Hazelight Studios&#x27; It Takes Two was named best Multiplayer game and best Original Property.

                              <span>Pirate Legends yearning for some adventure to really test their nautical prowess will finally get their wish from 21st April, when Sea of Thieves launches Legend of the Veil - a brand-new, story driven quest designed exclusively for the piratical cream of the crop.


Rare initially teased Legend of the Veil during its Sea of Thieves&#x27; 2022 roadmap reveal back in January, and with a release date for the adventure now confirmed, the developer has shared more on what players can expect to see come its arrival.


While Sea of Thieves&#x27; existing Pirate-Legend-focused Athena Voyages are little more than a clutch of Trading Company tasks strung together into one lengthy quest, Legend of the Veil is aiming to be rather more ambitious, blending the cinematic presentation of previous Tall Tales adventures - complete with cut-scenes, music, and voice work - with the randomness and replayability of standard voyages.

                              <span>If you hurl yourself over to the Epic Games Store right now, you&#x27;ve a strong selection of freebies to choose from in the form of Rogue Legacy and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, but if your lust for a bargain remains unsated, Epic has more to come, with developer Firaxis&#x27; XCOM 2 now confirmed as next week&#x27;s free game.


XCOM 2 is, of course, a bit of a winner, refining the base-building, alien-annihilating turn-based tactics of its 2012 predecessor (itself a refinement of Julian Gollop&#x27;s classic X-COM series) to create a prettier, tougher, richer game of extraterrestrial slaughter.


As Chris Bratt put it in his 2016 review, &quot;XCOM 2 isn&#x27;t a reworking of the original game...it&#x27;s a genuine response to it... Moment to moment, the thing that makes this astonishing game truly sing is the way in which it&#x27;s managed to respond to the bad habits we picked up last time around. Move faster, it urges. Take more risks. Become a more interesting player.&quot;

                              <span>A new report has highlighted staff concerns at Riot Games, as the League of Legends developer has begun encouraging staff back into its Los Angeles-based office.


Employees told Vice that Riot&#x27;s decision to drop its mask mandate and stop testing for unvaccinated employees put them at risk, as hybrid working with three days in the office per week was being encouraged as the new norm. 


Today&#x27;s report comes just a week after similar criticisms and staff walkouts at Activision, which also has studios in California. Both companies said the changes reflected their state&#x27;s recent relaxation in Covid safety rules - despite rising case numbers due to the Omicron BA2 subvariant.

&quot;Rogue Legacy 2 is finally reaching v1.0 and we couldn&#x27;t be happier with how it turned out,&quot; the developer wrote today. 
&quot;Our goal for Rogue Legacy 2 was always to make &#x27;Rogue Legacy 3&#x27; because we didn’t want to settle for just more.  It had to stay true to the original, but also stand on its own as something new.

A brilliant April Fool&#x27;s announcement from Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert has become a very-real revival for everyone&#x27;s favourite pirate Guybrush Threepwood. Meanwhile, Grand Theft Auto maker Rockstar is lending the Max Payne franchise back to Control developer Remedy.
Chatting with me about all this - and what we&#x27;d like to see revived next - are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy. We discuss playing as a digital Sam Lake, mangle poor Guybrush&#x27;s name, and hum the F-Zero theme tune.

Details are thin on the ground, but it feels like a major commitment for Lego&#x27;s digital future, and a huge win for Epic Games to be entrusted with the notoriously child-safe brand.

Around a decade ago, plans were in place for director Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill to adapt Eidos Montreal&#x27;s popular cyberpunk shooter into a film. But it wasn&#x27;t to be.


Derrickson and Cargill were snapped up by Marvel to make Doctor Strange, and without the duo onboard, production company CBS Films lost interest and moved on.

The logo, which looks like a rip-off of the euro sign, will be on the famous Italian club&#x27;s training gear from the beginning of next season.


The players wear the training kit during sessions at the Milanello Sports Centre and before every fixture in domestic and international competitions. They of course wear the proper AC Milan kit while they&#x27;re playing matches. Konami hasn&#x27;t got its eFootball logo on that - yet.

                              <span>Overwatch character Zarya has been quietly edited to remove a &quot;Z&quot; logo on her character model. 
Developer Blizzard has not yet commented on the change, though fans have spotted the &quot;Z&quot; has now disappeared in the game&#x27;s most recent update (thanks, PC Gamer).
It&#x27;s not hard to guess why this change has occured now. The &quot;Z&quot; symbol has recently become co-opted by Putin-supporting Russian citizens and emblazoned on military vehicles currently involved in the country&#x27;s devastating invasion of Ukraine.

                              <span>A new Ghost Recon game is reportedly in the works, following news that Ghost Recon Breakpoint has received its final update.


As reported by Kotaku, the next game in the series is codenamed OVER and was originally leaked by Nvidia. Kotaku sources claim it has already been in development for over a year and could be released in fiscal year 2023. 


Also reported is that free-to-play live-service shooter Ghost Recon Frontline is undergoing a reset following negative feedback from an internal playtest this year. It&#x27;s unlikely to launch soon.

                              <span>When working your way through Moreau’s watery swamp pit in Resident Evil Village, players were reportedly once set to encounter a range of new creatures, including mermaids. But as is to be expected from a Resident Evil game, these mermaids were not going to be the Disney princess versions akin to the likes of Ariel and her family. Rather, they were going to a (literal) monstrous pain for Ethan Winters and players.
Reliable Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem, who has a record of insider knowledge on the series&#x27; development, has shared more details on Moreau’s area within the game, as well as the enemies players would encounter there. When discussing the mermaid like enemies that were ultimately cut from the final release, Dusk Golem revealed:
&quot;In the water they could swim for you quickly if [they] spotted you, and you had to get to patches of land or kill them successfully before they reached you.

                              <span>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has only been out a couple of days, but players are already getting creative with some of its quirks. 


For example, you can&#x27;t kill children in the game - and players have found that by chaining lightsaber attacks against these invulnerable younglings, you can essentially levitate and hover to places you&#x27;d normally struggle to reach. 


Specifically, people are beating up little Episode 1-era Anakin Skywalker, who will simply glow red from repeated lightsaber damage. (Normally, whacking your party members with lightsabers sends them tumbling apart into their Lego components.)

Originally released in 1999, this was the first instalment in Camelot&#x27;s Mario Golf series and is considered the first modern Mario sports game, with a Game Boy Colour counterpart later that year. Check out the Japanese trailer below.

                              <span>Remedy has announced plans to remake Max Payne 1 and 2 after agreeing a deal with original publisher Rockstar.


The neo-noir action games, known for their bullet-time gameplay, return as a single title for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, and are built with Remedy’s own Northlight game engine.


According to Remedy, Rockstar is footing the bill for development. The studio behind Alan Wake and Control said the remake&#x27;s development budget is &quot;in line with a typical Remedy AAA-production&quot;.

                              <span>The first big fix for Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s launch issues – chiefly its grim grind made all the more unpalatable by the presence of microtransactions – is now live, boosting payouts for campaign and online events and making some other welcome changes along the way. 
New events have been introduced, with big races at Le Mans, Sardegna and Tokyo Expressway slotting in alongside other tweaked races towards the end of the campaign that now all deliver bigger payouts. There are new 1 hour endurance events available once you&#x27;ve reached Collector Level 23 – all coming under &#x27;The Human Comedy&#x27; banner, which is rather apt for the discipline – while online events will also now offer bigger payouts. Elsewhere the in-game credit cap has been lifted and more legendary cars will be listed in the auction house at any one time. 
And there&#x27;s more! Off-road physics, which were a bit waywards, have now been grounded, some graphical tweaks have taken place and plenty more besides – you can see the full rundown of what&#x27;s new in Gran Turismo 7 version 1.11 in the extensive patchnotes.

The Justice Department today announced a court-authorized operation, conducted in March 2022, to disrupt a two-tiered global botnet of thousands of infected network hardware devices under the control of a threat actor known to security researchers as Sandworm, which the U.S. government has previously attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (the GRU). The operation copied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that Sandworm used for command and control (C2) of the underlying botnet. Although the operation did not involve access to the Sandworm malware on the thousands of underlying victim devices worldwide, referred to as “bots,” the disabling of the C2 mechanism severed those bots from the Sandworm C2 devices’ control. ...</span>

As Kubernetes evolves, features and APIs are regularly revisited and removed. New features may offer
an alternative or improved approach to solving existing problems, motivating the team to remove the
old approach. Old APIs are first deprecated and then removed according to the Kubernetes Deprecation Policy.
We want to make sure you are aware of the changes coming in the Kubernetes 1.24 release. The release will
deprecate several (beta) APIs in favor of stable versions of the same APIs. The major change coming
in the Kubernetes 1.24 release is the removal of Dockershim. This is discussed
below and will be explored in more depth at release time. For an early look at the changes coming in Kubernetes 1.24, take a look at the in-progress CHANGELOG.

                              <span>Following on from a patch released only last week, Guerrilla has released yet another update for Horizon Forbidden West today.
This update continues to add improvements to the game, covering everything from the UI to the machines that roam through Horizon&#x27;s futuristic yet primal world. 
An issue with Melee Pits progression has been resolved with this patch, as have the multiple instances of machines getting stuck outside of the player’s reach during Side Quest objectives, thus conditionally blocking progression.

The way Pokémon Go has handled Mega Evolution - a popular mechanic from the monster franchise&#x27;s main games - has been criticised since its arrival in August 2020, although it has been improved over time. 


These upcoming potential changes - which, to be clear, are yet to be finalised and announced by developer Niantic - seem like they&#x27;ll go a lot further to address recurrent gripes and encourage more regular Mega Evolution as part of daily play.

                              <span>Konami will attempt to salvage its struggling eFootball 2022 next week with the game&#x27;s long-awaited v1.0.0 patch - which was originally set to arrive soon after launch last November.


eFootball - the new name for PES - arrived in a disastrous state late last year, despite Konami warning players it would arrive in extremely limited form akin to a demo. 


Konami insisted the game would evolve over time, but players have been left waiting months for this v1.0.0 update to arrive. In the meantime, eFootball&#x27;s mobile spin-off was postponed, and the game&#x27;s controversial premium player pack was pulled from sale.

                              <span>Mobile game Shining Force: Heroes of Light and Darkness has been cancelled.


Set for release in early 2022 when it was announced last year, it would have been the first new game in Sega&#x27;s strategy series since 2009.


It was being developed by Hive, a Japanese subsidiary of Korean developer Vespa (the studio behind mobile role-player King&#x27;s Raid) but development has ceased due to development costs and time required, according to Touch Arcade.

                              <span>New release Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has set fresh records for TT Games&#x27; Lego series on Steam. 


While not enough to trouble the likes of perenial Steam favourites, or rival the enormous Steam launch of Elden Ring, it is worth pointing out how good a launch Lego Star Wars has had compared to other games in the series.


The Skywalker Saga hit an 82,445 player peak on its launch day,  compared to numbers around the ~5000 player mark for Marvel Super Heroes, The Hobbit, Ninjago and Lord of the Rings (thanks, BenjiSales).

The online tactical shooter first launched in October 2019 and was poorly received, though has been kept fresh with new content themed around Splinter Cell and Terminator, alongside more standard game improvements. 
But more recently, it has become best known as the staging ground for Ubisoft Quartz, the company&#x27;s highly-controversial experiment in NFTs.

                              <span>Aloy can now instantly pick up resources in Horizon Forbidden West, after Guerrilla quietly added in the new feature.


Available as a toggle in the options, players can now turn off pickup animations so that Aloy instantly grabs nearby resources, speeding up the flow of exploration considerably.


It seems the feature was added in the most recent patch, though it&#x27;s strangely missing from the patch notes.

                              <span>My Time at Sandrock, the upcoming follow-up to My Time at Portia, will launch in early access via Steam and Epic Game Store on 26th May. 


Sandrock looks to follow a similar path to its gentle farming and life simulation predecessor, though this time set in sandier frontier-esque surroundings. 


You&#x27;ll need to tame the desert through cultivation of crops and construction of civic buildings, while winning over the local community and levelling up your friendships. Mining, cave exploration and combat also feature, alongside expanded customisation options for your home. Here&#x27;s a new trailer:

                              <span>Tomb Raider franchise developer Crystal Dynamics has confirmed what we all rather suspected already - that it is working on the next major game in the series - and that this project will be made in Unreal Engine 5.


The announcement capped off today&#x27;s Unreal Engine 5 presentation by Epic Games, which was timed alongside the engine&#x27;s general release.

Unreal Engine 5 is the powerful toolset behind Epic Games&#x27; recent The Matrix Awakens demo, and which also runs the ever-changing Fortnite.

                              <span>After its game-changing reveal on PlayStation 5 and following a period of early access, Unreal Engine 5 is finally available for general download. In combination with the release, Epic is releasing a cut-down, Keanu-free rendition of the remarkable The Matrix Awakens demo alongside a sample game project to experiment with, called Lyra. UE5&#x27;s release takes centre stage in today&#x27;s State of Unreal virtual event, and we&#x27;re told to expect a range of tech deep dives surrounding the technology alongside the launch of the engine itself.


UE5 takes the established Unreal Engine 4.27 and adds full support for a number of key next generation technologies. We&#x27;ve already seen these in action, of course. Lumen is Epic&#x27;s take on a fully real-time global illumination solution, eliminating the need to rely on static, pre-calculated &#x27;baked&#x27; lighting, leaning into hardware accelerated ray tracing where appropriate. Nanite is UE5&#x27;s virtualised micro-polygon technology, delivering incredibly granular detail from assets of motion picture quality and the elimination of geometry &#x27;pop-in&#x27;. 


The demands of these systems are such that native rendering at 4K resolution is not feasible on today&#x27;s game consoles and that ties into another key feature: Temporal Super Resolution. Recently seen for the first time in a non-UE5 title – Ghostwire: Tokyo – TSR is the best software-based temporal upscaling solution we&#x27;ve seen to date. In upscaling from a native 1080p to 4K – a 2x resolution boost on both axes – the quality is comparable (if not quite as good as) Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS.

                              <span>Hypnospace Outlaw is getting a sequel. Well, a spiritual sequel called Dreamsettler. But it&#x27;s almost exactly the same thing: a detective game set in an old version of the internet, which you&#x27;ll trawl to uncover a mystery.
And there&#x27;s more: another new game called Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer. It&#x27;s more of an accompaniment or spin-off, and it&#x27;s fictitiously made by Hypnospace Outlaw character Zane! Though developer Tendershoot and publisher No More Robots are so committed to this fiction they&#x27;ll even apparently roleplay as Zane when answering questions on Steam forums and so on.
The Slayer X game is like retro Doom, or Duke Nukem 3D - a game in that vein. It&#x27;s pixelated and filled with trashy gore and ridiculous weaponry. And if you know the story of Hypnospace Outlaw, you&#x27;ll know Zane is out for revenge. He apparently found an old CD-ROM with the game on and decided to brush it up for a noughties audience.

                              <span>Amazon Games has outlined its April and May content plan for Lost Ark, including two new playable classes.


Coming in April is the Glaivier, a new female martial artist advanced class who weaves together attacks with a spear and glaive depending on the two stances she uses: Focus and Flurry.


&quot;“&quot;While certain builds may focus your attention onto one of these weapons, an effective Glaivier can maximize their potential by creating balance between the two stances, building up energy in one stance which grants an impactful stat-boost when swapping to the other,&quot;”&quot; reads the blog post.

Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla heroine Eivor will become available to purchase later this week with a bundle of themed items, alongside a general launch for the game&#x27;s previously-released Ezio promotional skin.


Both Ezio and Eivor will make their item shop debuts upon the store&#x27;s refresh on Thursday night (that&#x27;s 1am Friday here in the UK).

In this new game, players will be pitted against each other in 5v5 matches, or &quot;Attack vs Defence&quot;. As the name suggests, attackers will have to gain intel on their enemy by deploying drones and breaching &quot;walls, floors and ceilings&quot;. Meanwhile, those on the defence team will have to ensure their intel is secure with the use of spy cameras and traps.
You can check out Rainbow Six Mobile&#x27;s reveal trailer below.

                              <span>The enjoyable Life is Strange: True Colors is the next major addition to Xbox Game Pass.


The latest entry in the teen-with-special-powers narrative adventure series first launched last summer, and was warmly received. It&#x27;s &quot;a beautiful return to small-town mystery and young adult drama,&quot; I wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Life is Strange: True Colors review.


True Colors is just one of Microsoft&#x27;s latest list of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass through the first half of April. Also on the cards are sports games Cricket 22 and MLB The Show 22, plus gothic fairytale Lost in Random and cybernoir point-and-click adventure Chinatown Detective Agency.

                              <span>Splatoon 2 icons have come to Nintendo Switch Online.
Last month saw Nintendo add a new missions and rewards section to its Switch Online service. Included here were a series of new icon elements from Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Super Mario Odyssey.
Now, these icons have been refreshed for April, with NSO users now able to get their hands on a different selection of Animal Crossing themed icons (all based around islanders with April birthdays) as well as ones from Splatoon 2.

                              <span>Concept art for Overwatch 2 has raised the possibility that Blizzard&#x27;s hero shooter sequel will include a battle pass. 


A concept for the game&#x27;s main menu, designed by Blizzard senior UI artist Jayson Kirby, has popped up online via Artstation (as spotted by Attack of the Fanboy).


The image shows a new look for the game&#x27;s homepage, complete with familiar options to access its hero roster, shop and challenges - but also a separate battle pass option.

Created by Anita Sarna and Karolina Krupecka of food blog Nerds&#x27; Kitchen (and Witcher Kitchen), it&#x27;s officially licensed by CD Projekt Red and will feature 80 recipes inspired by Geralt’s travels in the games.


The book will include &quot;meticulously-researched, immersive recipes that give fans a taste of the distinct flavours a witcher might sample as he travels the countryside in search of monsters to slay and coin to earn,&quot; according to the pre-order page.

                              <span>Following confusion over the project&#x27;s future, the director of upcoming PS5 game Abandoned has spoken out about why developer Blue Box deleted various tweets about the game, the status of the game&#x27;s prologue and his own &quot;heartbreak&quot; about the situation now surrounding the game&#x27;s release.
Speaking to IGN, Hasan Kahraman of Blue Box Game Studios said the developer had removed older tweets about the game in a bid to keep information surrounding Abandoned up to date. &quot;Basically, the tweets were deleted because some of the concept has changed, and I figured maybe just deleting the tweet and then tweeting more relevant information would be a better idea - which was actually not a good idea,&quot; Kahraman said.
&quot;I have learned now just to keep them. Even if the information or concept changed, just keep the older information because people eventually will see for themselves what the difference is and then see what&#x27;s more actual.&quot;

                              <span>Activision Blizzard employees have taken part in a planned strike in protest at the company&#x27;s recent decision to drop its requirement that in-office staff are vaccinated.


Last week, the embattled World of Warcraft and Call of Duty maker announced it would no longer require office-based staff to have had Covid jabs, while encouraging a gradual return to in-person working over the coming months.


The decision, announced in an email by Activision Blizzard exec Brian Bulatao, was immediately criticised by staff who said it risked employees who may be immunocompromised or who lived with others who are, and was poorly timed as the US faces up to Covid&#x27;s current Omicron BA2 subvariant.

                              <span>Elden Ring boss Radahn was accidentally nerfed in a patch, but now he&#x27;s back to full strength.


FromSoftware&#x27;s previous patch for the game added new features like NPC icons and quests, as well as balance changes. But nerfing the infamous boss Starscourge Radahn was unintentional.


Now a new patch is available that fixes &quot;a bug in the balance adjustment of the boss Starscourge Radahn in update 1.03, in which the power of some attacks was unintentionally reduced&quot;.

                              <span>Brian Krebs has a detailed post about hackers using fake police data requests to trick companies into handing over data.
Virtually all major technology companies serving large numbers of users online have departments that routinely review and process such requests, which are typically granted as long as the proper documents are provided and the request appears to come from an email address connected to an actual police department domain name.

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper, the really promising new game by In Other Waters developer Jump Over the Age, will be released 5th May.

Excitingly, it&#x27;ll be available day-one on Xbox Game Pass, on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. It&#x27;ll also be available on PC from a number of stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, Humble), and - this just in - Nintendo Switch. There&#x27;s no PlayStation version, sadly.

I played a demo of Citizen Sleeper recently and was impressed. It&#x27;s a mash-up of a board game and an RPG. There&#x27;s a lot of descriptive text and dialogue choices, as you&#x27;d get in an RPG, and there&#x27;s levelling up and skills and that kind of thing. But it all plays out in a turn-based, board game kind of way, and quite a lot of what you can do depends on dice you roll at the beginning of each turn. It takes a bit of getting used to.

Monkey Island co-creator Ron Gilbert is spearheading the project, alongside fellow co-creator Dave Grossman. Dominic Armato will also return as the fan-favourite voice of Guybrush Threepwood.
To accompany this announcement, a new teaser was also revealed, with a tenuous release date set for some time this year.

The footage in question shows a character named Gex Jr. making his way through what appears to be a cinema. 
Gex Jr. jumps from screen to popcorn machine and on to yet another screen (one of which appears to show Gex from Crystal Dynamics’ original games), all while chugging down cans of fizzy soda and making some pretty dated references.

                              <span>Square Enix has released a new patch for its Final Fantasy themed kart racing sim Chocobo GP.
This patch will finally address numerous bugs present in the game, including an issue where the game stopped progressing at the rankings screen at the end of a race or while matchmaking for the next race. 
It will also attend to an issue where finishing in fourth place or higher was treated as being eliminated due to lag.

                              <span>Elden Ring players have moved beyond speedruns to find alternative ways to play.


First up there’s Twitch streamer Seki, who not only completed the game in under three hours - an impressive feat alone - but did so without taking any damage.


Seki’s run was the world’s first to do so - while streamer GinoMachino managed a no hit run on 13th March, Seki took no damage at all. That means completing the whole game without taking fall or poison damage, let alone getting hit.

He also admitted, &quot;it&#x27;s a difficult situation that&#x27;s going to take the team time to work through&quot;.

                              <span>A new mode for The Division 2 sees players fighting to take back control of a nuclear power station which has been captured by enemy forces. 


Ubisoft has not trumpeted the arrival of the new eight-player offering, dubbed Countdown, and it&#x27;s easy to see why. The new mode has launched while the very real fight for control of Chernobyl power station has been in the headlines, during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 


Of course, the mode has been in development for some time - and was not created in response to the real-world crisis. The timing, however, is unforunate.

As previously reported, arrangers Charlie Rosen and Jake Silverman were nominated for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella for their Big Band arrangement of Meta Knight&#x27;s Revenge from Kirby Superstar.


It means Nintendo’s little pink ball - or at least, Rosen and Silverman - is only the second ever video game winner at the awards.

                              <span>Sony has quietly removed an offer for PS Now in the wake of the announcement for its revamped PS Plus subscription.



An offer was previously available to purchase a year’s subscription to streaming service PS Now for $59.99 (on the US PSN). This was a particularly good deal as existing PS Now subscribers will automatically transfer to the Premium tier of the new PS Plus worth $119.99 a year.


However, PS Now can currently only be purchased on a monthly basis (£8.99). Once the new PS Plus launches, PS Now will no longer be available as a standalone product so players will move to the equivalent tier at £13.49 monthly.

Boxed versions of GTA5 are retailing at £24.99 from outlets such as GAME in the UK (click here for the PS5 version and here for the Xbox Series X version). 
Unless you particularly want to have a boxed version of the game to add to your collection, however, it is worth noting that digital copies of GTA5 are considerably cheaper.

While experts tell me that the concept of a “responsible disclosure timeline” is a little outdated and heavily depends on the situation, we’re generally measuring in days, not years. “The majority of researchers have policies where if they make a good faith effort to reach a vendor and don’t get a response, that they publicly disclose in 30 days,” Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and former chief security officer at Facebook, tells me...</span>

News article:
Stanford researchers have solved a mystery about why a species of squid native to California has been found thriving in the Gulf of Alaska about 1,800 miles north of its expected range: climate change.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

…some forms of MFA are stronger than others, and recent events show that these weaker forms aren’t much of a hurdle for some hackers to clear. In the past few months, suspected script kiddies like the Lapsus$ data extortion gang and elite Russian-state threat actors (like Cozy Bear, the group behind the SolarWinds hack) have both successfully defeated the protection.

Bulatao&#x27;s email began by suggesting conditions in the US were currently improving - despite the rising tide of new cases brought by the increasingly-dominant Omicron BA.2 subvariant, and the relatively low percentage of US citizens protected by a Covid booster dose.

By snippet, I really do mean snippet. It was a &quot;blink and you will miss it&quot; situation. However, after playing it coy throughout Breath of the Wild 2&#x27;s most recent trailer, this delay announcement did finally reveal the front of Link, and more of his corrupted arm (with said corruption looking like it is also starting to make its way across Link&#x27;s chest).
It also showed the Master Sword looking a tad worse for wear. In fact, it looked downright ruined.

                              <span>A group of US senators has expressed concern at the possibility of a windfall payout for controversial Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick, as part of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed acquisition of his company. 
Four politicians, including former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, signed a letter to the Federal Trade Commission alerting it to the issue, The Wall St Journal has reported. 
The FTC is currently examining the details of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68bn deal to buy Activision Blizzard, which is expected to be finalised next year.

However, some eager players have begun diligently translating the runes, including Reddit user oposdeo.

Even so, it retains Skylines&#x27; core strategic city planning, giving players the tools to construct their metropolis piece by piece - from roads to neighbourhoods to districts - while juggling its economy, emergency services, and education and entertainment needs along the week.

                              <span>A new report has shed light behind the scenes of State of Decay 3, the upcoming open world zombie game from the Undead Labs.
Details published by Kotaku include allegations of sexism and mismanagement at the Microsoft-owned studio, and paint a picture of a game project which is still struggling to get off the ground years after its official reveal.
State of Decay 3 began pre-production in late 2018, though developers at Undead Labs were reportedly poorly-managed and the project took several team re-organisations to get off the ground. Staff have claimed the game&#x27;s public announcement in 2020 was too early, and at that point Undead Labs &quot;didn&#x27;t even know what it was&quot;.

                              <span>Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 - the, would you believe it, third game in developer Inti Creates&#x27; acclaimed side-scrolling action-platforming series - will be heading to Switch on 28th July.
The original Azure Striker Gunvolt, which launched to a solid reception on 3DS back in 2014, took its retro-infused cue from Capcom&#x27;s beloved Mega Man series, with Inti Creates having previously worked on Mega Man Zero, ZX, 9, and 10 (Gunvolt was also executive produced by Mega Man&#x27;s Keiji Inafune). A sequel arrived two years later, and both games can now be played on Switch via the Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack, if you&#x27;re curious to learn more.
All of which brings us to Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 which, having initially been announced back in 2020, is now almost ready to for its Switch debut. The big change for this new outings is new playable character Kirin, bringing a new play-style as she battles foes using a combination of her speedy sword, throwable talismans, and Arc Chain ability, enabling her to close gaps instantly.

                              <span>Twitch has suspended its paid boost train feature after porn was boosted to the front page.
The feature was introduced in March this year, but bears a resemblance to the paid boosts programme that ended in late 2021, as clarified by a Twitch representative to PC Gamer.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t Starve Together, developer Klei Entertainment&#x27;s co-operative multiplayer twist on its acclaimed survival adventure, will be making its way to Switch on 12th April.
If you&#x27;ve already played Don&#x27;t Starve, you&#x27;ll be right at home with Together; it takes the original&#x27;s deliciously dark survival conceit - in which you awake in an expansive, wonderfully twisted world and must forage, maim, eat, and build in order to survive long enough to orchestrate an escape - but enables you to do it all with friends in tow.
There are three different modes available - Survival (in which players become revivable ghosts on death), the resurrection-free Wilderness, and a more leisurely Endless mode - all incorporating features from the original Don&#x27;t Stare, its Reign of Giants expansion, plus elements from the Hamlet and Shipwrecked DLCs.

Parkasaurus, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, takes obvious inspiration from the likes of Theme Park and DinoPark Tycoon, giving players all the tools they need to build and staff their very own dino-flavoured tourist attraction. Crucially, that involves providing the perfect habitats for a wide variety of adorable prehistoric creatures, with each dinosaur having specific terrain, water, food, privacy, and scenery requirements.
And once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s time to throw open the doors for an endless procession of guests, and they in turn have their own needs to be fulfilled - from places to eat to places to poop - if they&#x27;re going to continue to spend, spend, spend. And hopefully not get eaten.

&quot;The previous Minecraft Preview build available to Xbox Insiders inadvertently included prototype code for raytracing support on Xbox consoles,&quot; Microsoft said in a message posted to the official Minecraft Twitter account.

                              <span>E3 has officially ditched its digital-only event this year, which, following the cancellation of its in-person show back in January, means there&#x27;ll be no E3 at all in 2022.
E3&#x27;s 2022 started to look shaky in January, when show organiser the ESA confirmed it wouldn&#x27;t be holding a physical event this year due to potential risks from covid - though several journalists subsequently suggested it had actually been scrapped before Christmas - marking the third year in a row E3&#x27;s in-person component has been cancelled.
Instead, there were reports the Entertainment Software Association was once again planning a digital offering in place of this year&#x27;s live show - in a similar manner to last year&#x27;s virtual event - but the organisation has now confirmed E3 will be skipping 2022 entirely.

                              <span>Developer Heart Machine has unveiled Hyper Light Breaker, a fully 3D rogue-lite spin on its acclaimed 2016 action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter that&#x27;s coming to PC early next year.
While Hyper Light Drifter served up a tautly designed single-player adventure blending rich exploration with challenging melee combat in a strikingly presented top-down, 2D world, Hyper Light Breaker looks like a very different take on the same universe.
It all unfolds in the Overgrowth, a new &quot;vast, ever-changing&quot; (and fully 3D) world consisting of massive, open biomes and deep labyrinths - which players can navigate using the likes of wall-dashing, hoverboarding, and gliding. Here, they&#x27;ll be able to &quot;defeat brutal monsters, create new builds, survive the mysterious Crowns and overthrow the almighty Abyss King.&quot;

That&#x27;s according to Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden, who, citing &quot;trusted sources familiar with with Microsoft&#x27;s efforts&quot;, reports the family plan has been in the works for some time as Microsoft navigated issues around royalty distribution and third-party licenses. Those kinks are presumably close to being ironed out now, however, with Corden suggesting an official unveiling may happen relatively soon. 
As for what the family plan might offer, it&#x27;ll reportedly enable five users in the same country to access Game Pass&#x27; entire library using a single membership, with the cost said to be &quot;far cheaper&quot; than paying for five individual subscriptions.

                              <span>Closing in on seven years after the launch of its hugely successful Kickstarter, Castelvania spiritual successor Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is still ticking off stretch goals, with its latest update delivering its third and final promised playable character - which turns out to be a cameo crossover from Ubisoft Montreal&#x27;s fondly remembered fantasy platformer Child of Light.
&quot;Aurora has lost her way and awoken in a strange, dangerous new land,&quot; explains developer ArtPlay in a new Kickstarter update. &quot;Armed with the Sword of Matildis and accompanied by the loyal Igniculus, she must find a way to escape.&quot;
Upon downloading today&#x27;s free 1.30 update, players can take Child of Light protagonist Aurora (who joins existing playable characters Miriam and Zangetsu, plus &quot;bonus&quot; character Bloodless) on a gothic romp through Bloodstained&#x27;s familiar castle, making use of her sword, companion Igniculus - who can slow opponents or heal Aurora - and her directional Light Ray skill, which damages any enemies caught in its beam.

                              <span>Closing in on seven years after the launch of its hugely successful Kickstarter, Castelvania spiritual successor Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is still ticking off stretch goals, with its latest update delivering its third and final promised playable character - which turns out to be a cameo crossover from Ubisoft Montreal&#x27;s fondly remembered fantasy platformer Child of Light.
&quot;Aurora has lost her way and awoken in a strange, dangerous new land,&quot; explains developer ArtPlay in a new Kickstarter update. &quot;Armed with the Sword of Matildis and accompanied by the loyal Igniculus, she must find a way to escape.&quot;

Bloodhunt (not to be confused with Big Bad Wolf Studio&#x27;s upcoming  RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong, Paradox Interactive&#x27;s troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, or indeed 2019 visual novel Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York) was announced toward the end of 2020 and had a limited Steam early access run the following year.
It is, all in all, pretty much exactly what it sounds like, casting participants - either playing solo or in a team of three - as vampires and setting them loose across the rain-soaked, moon-drenched streets and rooftops of Prague. All players have access to basic vampire trickery such as the ability to scramble up walls, but the characters they choose (from one of several vampire clans) inform the additional supernatural powers they&#x27;re able to deploy. Oh, and there are lots and lots of guns to loot too, if you&#x27;d just rather just do the shooty thing.

Earthworm Jim 2 can be played through the Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s SNES app.

Kyle Hanagami, a choreographer who has worked with Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and J-Lo, filed suit against Epic regarding the &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; emote, which was released within Fortnite back in August 2020. 
Lawyers for Hanagami have said the emote uses copyrighted dance moves from a 2017 video set to Charlie Puth&#x27;s &quot;How Long&quot; (thanks, Kotaku) without credit or compensation.

                              <span>North Korean hackers have been exploiting a zero-day in Chrome.
The flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-0609, was exploited by two separate North Korean hacking groups. Both groups deployed the same exploit kit on websites that either belonged to legitimate organizations and were hacked or were set up for the express purpose of serving attack code on unsuspecting visitors. One group was dubbed Operation Dream Job, and it targeted more than 250 people working for 10 different companies. The other group, known as AppleJeus, targeted 85 users.

Details:
The attackers made use of an exploit kit that contained multiple stages and components in order to exploit targeted users. The attackers placed links to the exploit kit within hidden iframes, which they embedded on both websites they owned as well as some websites they compromised...</span>

Way back in December of 2020, Kubernetes announced the deprecation of Dockershim. In Kubernetes, dockershim is a software shim that allows you to use the entire Docker engine as your container runtime within Kubernetes. In the upcoming v1.24 release, we are removing Dockershim - the delay between deprecation and removal in line with the project’s policy of supporting features for at least one year after deprecation. If you are a cluster operator, this guide includes the practical realities of what you need to know going into this release. Also, what do you need to do to ensure your cluster doesn’t fall over!

                              <span>Microsoft has reinstated the ability for Xbox users to share game screenshots and videos directly to Twitter in response to feedback it received after removing the feature from console dashboards in an Xbox Insider build earlier this month.
While the direct Twitter sharing feature never got the chop in the live build of the Xbox dashboard - meaning the impact of its removal was limited - there were certainly grumbles from Insider testers after they were forced to grapple with more cumbersome methods of image and video sharing, requiring them to first upload clips to their phones, following the changes made in Microsoft&#x27;s previous Insider build.
Now, however, in response Insider feedback, direct Twitter sharing has returned in Microsoft&#x27;s last Beta Ring build. &quot;Thanks for your feedback on the Twitter share feature change we flighted in 2204,&quot; Xbox Insider program lead Brad Rosetti wrote in a tweet. &quot;That change is being reverted to the previous behaviour from today in this new build&quot;.

Break the Bank is all about the gold, and its centrepiece is an opulent depository for unimaginable riches known as The Bank. Mechanically, this is quite a bit different from other biomes so far added to developer Motion Twin&#x27;s acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer, given that its entrance - a mysterious giant chest - will appear at random during a run.
Provided you&#x27;ve first completed its sole unlock criteria - reach the Hand of the King once - the chest can appear in any of Dead Cells&#x27; post-biome transition stages, and players will need to decide right then and there if they want to open it and delve into The Bank. If they decide yes, The Bank will replace the next biome along the path (it won&#x27;t appear before a boss), but should they choose to forego its temptations, it won&#x27;t reappear on the same run.

                              <span>Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe - the remake of the remake of everybody&#x27;s favourite comedic rumination on video game agency - finally has a release date and will, after a number of not-insignificant delays, be heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 27th April.
Stanley Parable&#x27;s Ultra Deluxe edition was first announced back in 2018, with developers Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows (the respective studios of original Stanley Parable creator Davey Wreden and William Pugh, who co-designed the 2013 remake of the 2011 original) aiming to launch the following year. 2020 bought a second delay, and a hat-trick was achieved in 2021 - leaving many to ponder if the whole thing mightn&#x27;t actually be some sort of mega-meta ruse and that the game didn&#x27;t, and would never, exist.
Happy days are now here, however, with Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows having finally given the Ultra Deluxe edition a 27th April release date - 4/27, of course, being the number on Stanley&#x27;s near-iconic office door. And if that&#x27;s not appropriately self-referential enough for you, the announcement is accompanied by a recreation of the Stanley Parable&#x27;s 2013 trailer - only this time the player goes left.

Stanley Parable&#x27;s Ultra Deluxe edition was first announced back in 2018, with developers Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows (the respective studios of original Stanley Parable creator Davey Wreden and William Pugh, who co-designed the 2013 remake of the 2011 original) aiming to launch the following year. 2020 bought a second delay, and a hat-trick was achieved in 2021 - leaving many to ponder if the whole thing mightn&#x27;t actually be some sort of mega-meta ruse and that the game didn&#x27;t, and would never, exist.

                              <span>UPDATE 30/3/22: Sony has now formally unveiled April&#x27;s PlayStation Plus games line-up and, unsurprisingly given the veracity of previous PlayStation Plus leaks from French forum Dealabs, the official list remains unchanged.
That means, from 5th April, PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to download and play acclaimed card-battler Slay the Spire (PS4), Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends (PS4 &amp; PS5), and SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated (PS4).
Sony has also warned PlayStation 5 owners that Persona 5 is being removed from its PlayStation Plus Collection on 11th May, meaning they should download it soon while the chance remains.

                              <span>Today marks the launch of Intel&#x27;s Arc A-series graphics family, the company&#x27;s first discrete graphics cards to go head to head against industry titans AMD and Nvidia. To start, Team Blue is building its Arc GPUs for laptops, with entry-level Arc 3 models debuting now in laptops from $899. Higher-powered models called Arc 5 and Arc 7 are set to arrive early this summer, in higher-end machines. The company also teased its first desktop Arc graphics card at the very end of its presentation, showing off a much beefier design than the DG1 card shipped to developers last year. Here&#x27;s what you need to know from Intel&#x27;s Arc announcements.
First of all, the Arc series of graphics cards ought to be fully-featured models, with support for the full DirectX 12 Ultimate feature set (ray tracing, VRS, mesh shading, sampler feedback) plus DirectStorage and XeSS AI upscaling. That puts them on an even keel with Nvidia in terms of most features, and ahead of AMD who don&#x27;t yet have a temporal upscaling solution. 
Intel detailed some specs for each of the five models announced thus far, including the number of Xe cores, ray tracing units and GDDR6 memory allocation. Given the relatively rapid scaling between families - we see a doubling of core count and VRAM from the top Arc 3 model to Arc 5, then another doubling to the top Arc 7 model - we could start to see very impressive performance from those top-end models.

                              <span>Sony has warned PlayStation 5 owners that Persona 5 is being removed from its PlayStation Plus Collection on 11th May.
The PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside PS5 back in 2020, giving PlayStation Plus members on Sony&#x27;s new console access to 20 first- and third-party PlayStation 4 titles for as long as their subscription continued:
From 11th May, however, that impressive list will be down by one, as announced at the bottom of April&#x27;s PlayStation Plus games reveal. Anyone still wishing to take advantage of Persona 5&#x27;s inclusion still have time to do so, though - they&#x27;ll just need to ensure they&#x27;ve added the game to their library prior to the 11th May deadline. As long as this is done, the game will continue to be available while a PlayStation Plus subscription is active.

That much we already knew, but now the publisher has provided early details of Season 4 - which will include the likes of airplanes and agricultural revolution - revealing its first DLC will arrive on 12th April.
As outlined in Ubisoft&#x27;s new introductory video, Anno 1800&#x27;s fourth season will introduce a total of three new paid DLCs before 2022 is through, with its first offering being titled Seeds of Change. Arriving on 12th April, this will enable players to &quot;revolutionise&quot; the agricultural sector of the New World, introducing a powerful new building - the Hacienda - that will become the agricultural hub of players&#x27; empires.
Expanding the Hacienda with its various modules will enable players to gain access to a range of new agriculture-centric features, including the ability to produce import goods in the New World (such as beer) in order to help the population become more independent. Additionally, players will be able to adopt island-wide policies and produce high-quality fertiliser to boost farms in both the New and Old Worlds.

Speaking to IGN, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 director Jeff Fowler stated the films will be a melting pot of ideas rather than directly paralleling the game series.

&quot;It&#x27;s not always going to be a linear progression of like &#x27;Oh, this was in Sonic 2 so it&#x27;s going to be in the Sonic 2 film&#x27;,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s going to be a little bit of a cherry picking, a little bit of a melting pot. There&#x27;s so much great, inspiring imagery to pull from the 30 years of games. So if we didn&#x27;t get it in one film, there&#x27;s always the chance that we&#x27;ll revisit it somewhere else.&quot;

Following criticism, this was followed up by a further email apologising for the lack of information and offering more detail on the issue.

However, lead writer Sam Maggs has responded to IGN&#x27;s coverage stating &quot;it&#x27;s pretty upsetting and frankly offensive&quot; that she wasn&#x27;t included in Stuart&#x27;s talk, adding &quot;sucks to have my work erased&quot;.

As a post from the studio on Russian social network VK explains, some players may be unable to make payments on Steam, while for Switch owners Nintendo has suspended Russian payments in the eShop.

&quot;Funomena was in the process of closing an investment round just before GDC, and we are still actively working to do so,&quot; reads the tweet. &quot;Last week we let everyone know that if we do not successfully finish the fundraise, we will be forced to close the studio.
&quot;We love game development, we love making games and we love bringing people into the community. It is our sincere hope that we can continue to do so, together.&quot;

                              <span>The malicious uses of these technologies are scary:
Police reportedly arrived on the scene last week and found the man crouched beside the woman’s passenger side door. According to the police, the man had, at some point, wrapped his Apple Watch across the spokes of the woman’s passenger side front car wheel and then used the Watch to track her movements. When police eventually confronted him, he admitted the Watch was his. Now, he’s reportedly being charged with attaching an electronic tracking device to the woman’s vehicle.

                              <span>Despite being used as a showcase for Xbox Series X/S&#x27; raytracing capabilities prior to the console&#x27;s launch in 2020, Minecraft has so far remained doggedly raytracing-free on the machine. That looks to be about to change, however, with the feature having now surfaced in the latest build of Minecraft&#x27;s Xbox Preview programme.
As spotted by Tom Warren, senior editor on The Verge, Minecraft&#x27;s latest Preview version on Xbox Series X/S (currently only available to Xbox Insider members) features raytracing as a toggle-able option, giving the more-than-a-decade-old game a bit of a modern day spruce-up.

                              <span>Developer Funomena, which collaborated with Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi on 2020&#x27;s Wattam, is reportedly closing down following recent allegations of workplace abuse at the studio, all focussing on company boss Robin Hunicke.
Those allegations first came to light last week as part of an investigation by People Make Games into workplace abuses at three indie studios. In that report, People Make Games&#x27; Chris Bratt spoken to Funomena staff who claimed Hunicke was emotionally abusive and often used sensitive personal information in a way that was humiliating or unprofessional, with some employees describing Hunicke as &quot;the instigator of a huge amount of toxicity&quot; at the studio.

                              <span>A US district court judge has confirmed they&#x27;re &quot;prepared to approve&quot; Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard&#x27;s $18m USD settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year, despite objections from other parties.
Activision Blizzard initially announced it had reached an agreement with the EEOC - to set aside $18m for employees who had experienced harassment and discrimination at the company - last September, but court approval of the settlement was delayed after California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing objected.
In that objection, the DFEH - which had filed its own bombshell lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in July last year, calling the publisher a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - claimed the settlement would cause &quot;irreparable harm&quot; to its own ongoing legal proceedings if approved, given that its terms would, among other things, require employees to release Activision Blizzard from claims under California state law.

                              <span>If cute critters of the damp variety are your thing, Frontier Developments has you covered in Planet Zoo&#x27;s latest DLC expansion, known as the Wetlands Animal Pack, which will introduce the likes of the capybara, platypus, and more when it heads to PC on 12th April.
Wetlands, if you haven&#x27;t been keeping a tally, will be Planet Zoo&#x27;s ninth DLC expansion since its launch in 2019, following on from the Arctic Pack, South America Pack, Australia Pack, Aquatic Pack, Southeast Asia Animal Pack, Africa Pack, North America Animal Pack, and Europe Pack.
Given that this latest expansion falls into the &#x27;Animal Pack&#x27; category, it lacks the zoo-sprucing scenery items seen in Planet Zoo&#x27;s just plain-old &#x27;Pack&#x27; packs, instead choosing to focus on a boosted number of creature additions - in this case bringing a grand total of eight new water-themed species: the capybara, platypus, Asian small-clawed otter, spectacled caiman, Nile lechwe, wild water buffalo, red-crowned crane, and Danube crested newt.

                              <span>Developer Witch Beam&#x27;s &quot;zen&quot; puzzler Unpacking - which, you may recall, was named Eurogamer&#x27;s Game of the Year in 2021 - will be making its way to PlayStation 4 and PS5 &quot;soon&quot;.
Unpacking initially burst out of its box toward the end of last year, giving PC, Switch, and Xbox players the opportunity to experience significant moments in the life of its protagonist, as relayed entirely through the act of pulling her current possessions out of boxes and packing them away into a new living space each time.
&quot;Here&#x27;s a puzzle game, at surface, about tidying things away,&quot; wrote Martin Robinson on announcing Unpacking as Eurogamer&#x27;s Game of the Year in 2021, &quot;a premise that&#x27;s compelling enough alone. There&#x27;s something soothing about the fundamentals of neatly folding away t-shirts and socks while proudly stacking books on once empty shelves.&quot;

                              <span>With April inching ever closer, Microsoft has hoisted its Games With Gold sack once more, upending it to reveal a fresh selection of titles being made available as part of Xbox Live Gold (and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) subscriptions next month, which this time look an awful lot like Hue, Another Sight, Outpost Kaloki X, and MX vs ATV Alive.
Hue, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is puzzle adventure that sees players wandering a grey world and using their colour-based powers to push ever forward. Puzzles are largely built around the ability to change the background colour of the world, either causing previously invisible objects to be made visible or to colour-match obstacles so they disappear. Developer Fiddlesticks Games expands on that premise to deliver an experience that&#x27;s as sweet as it is clever - and Xbox Live Gold subscribers can grab it as part of Games With Gold from 16th April to 15th May.
As for Another Sight, it&#x27;s a &quot;surreal fantasy adventure&quot; with another distinctive mechanic at its core. Here, players take on the role of a partially sighted girl named Kit and her cat Hodge, flipping between the two and using their respective abilities to solve puzzles and progress - Hodge being smaller, more agile and able to view much more of the environment on-screen, and Kit being more attuned to noises around her and able to manipulate larger objects. It&#x27;s available on Games With Gold from 1st-30th April.

However, this soon made the game very confusing, so this idea was ultimately scrapped. &quot;For example: &#x27;Ratchet needs to rescue Clank from Ratchet, who doesn&#x27;t trust Ratchet and has a long history battling Nefarious,&#x27;&quot; explained Staurt.

                              <span>In response to last week&#x27;s incident in which Destiny videos by prominent content creators on YouTube were hit with a spate of false copyright takedowns, developer Bungie has filed a lawsuit against ten unnamed individuals it believes responsible.
At the time of the incident, Bungie - whose own YouTube content was impacted by the bogus copyright claims - insisted the takedowns were not the result of a request by either itself or its partners. The studio later revealed the takedowns had come from &quot;fraudulent accounts created to impersonate our IP protection service&quot;, which it believed may have been retaliation for a &quot;recent set of authentic takedowns of OST uploads&quot;.
Following the results of its initial investigation, Bungie has now (thanks TorrentFreak) launched legal action against ten unnamed individuals, who it admits it does not yet know the identity of, but says it will &quot;discover...soon, via subpoena or otherwise&quot;. However, while those individuals - and the &quot;nearly incalculable damage&quot; their actions caused - are the focus of the lawsuit, it also has more than a few choice words for Google, extensively highlighting the flaws in what it calls the &quot;gaping security loophole&quot; of YouTube&#x27;s &quot;easily-gamed&quot; DMCA-process security.

                              <span>Last Friday marked the ninth anniversary of free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, and developer Digital Extremes has now donned its jaunty party hat in order to celebrate the not-insignificant milestone with a birthday freebie and five weeks of premium rewards.
On the freebie front, players will receive the Wisp Dex Skin - the same one used in Warframe&#x27;s 9th anniversary art below - via an Inbox Message in their Orbiter upon logging into the game for a limited time. In addition to that, Digital Extremes has prepared five weeks of premium Anniversary Rewards - including Skins, Weapon Slots, and Noggles (basically, bobbleheads for your Orbiter) - which can be earned by completing weekly in-game Alerts.
Rounding out each week of rewards are special Weekend Booster events - enabling players to earn Double Affinity, Double Credits, or both, depending on the weekend in question - and the full list of Alert Rewards and Weekend Boosters can be found below. Illustrative images for the rewards, incidentally, are available on the Warframe anniversary website.

                              <span>Last Friday marked the ninth anniversary of free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, and developer Digital Extremes has now donned its jaunty party hat in order to celebrate the not-insignificant milestone with a birthday freebie and five weeks of premium rewards.
On the freebie front, players will receive the Wisp Dex Skin - the same one used in Warframe&#x27;s 9th anniversary art below - via an Inbox Message in their Orbiter upon logging into the game for a limited time. In addition to that, Digital Extremes has prepared five weeks of premium Anniversary Rewards - including Skins, Weapon Slots, and Noggles (basically, bobbleheads for your Orbiter) - which can be earned by completing weekly in-game Alerts.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has unveiled One Piece Odyssey, a new RPG adaptation of the hugely popular anime and manga series, which will feature a brand-new story - plus new character and monster designs - from creator Eiichiro Oda when it comes to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC later this year.
One Piece Odyssey unfolds on a mysterious island - which the Straw Hats pirate gang discover after their ship is caught in a storm - with Bandai Namco promising dungeons, quests, &quot;wonders of a raging nature, powerful enemies, and strange encounters with island locals&quot;.
Odyssey&#x27;s announcement trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal much beyond an apparent exploration focus for the &quot;epic drama adventure&quot;, but Bandai Namco notes players won&#x27;t just take control of series protagonist Monkey D. Luffy as the new adventure unfolds; they&#x27;ll also be able to play as other familiar faces, including Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Frankie, and Brook.

Last year marginalised creators on the platform were rocked by a surge of malicious hate raids and the hashtag #TwitchDoBetter was used to criticise Twitch&#x27;s response. This was followed by the #ADayOffTwitch campaign.

However, this new campaign is asking for a resurgence in support.

Distortion2 has now followed that with a speedrun time of 18:58.

The files in questions were found by Twitter user JesterPatches, who wrote: &quot;Looking through [Elden Ring&#x27;s] files I came across a few icons making me believe that a bestiary was planned at some point.&quot;
The user continues: &quot;There are 128 icons showing different NPCs. Each NPC shown has two icons, one greyed out and another one filled in, so it could be not found and found.&quot;

Forgotten Land launched on Friday 25th March and has already sold 2.5 times the number of copies as the previous top Kirby launch, 2018&#x27;s Kirby Star Allies on Switch.

Sons of the Forest is the sequel to Endnight&#x27;s The Forest, and promises plenty more unnerving gameplay for survival-horror fans. However, this horror-fest will have to wait, as Endnight wants to ensure it delivers the best game to its patrons, and as such has moved its release date back a few months.
Sharing the news on Twitter, the developer wrote: &quot;Over these past few weeks, we have realised that our May 2022 release date for Sons of The Forest was overly ambitious.

                              <span>Despite first releasing all the way back in 2013, Bioshock Infinite players have noticed the PC version of the game has been receiving numerous updates over the last several months. 
These updates initially started in September of last year and they just keep on coming. March alone has seen 13 changes to the game (thanks TheGamer). 
There are many theories as to what these updates are all in aid of. Some on Reddit have taken this as a sign that Bioshock Infinite will be getting a remaster, but this seems unlikely.

                              <span>Forza Horizon 5 is introducing a new PvP progression system.
As detailed in the patch notes (thanks, TheGamer) - in which the team says &quot;we&#x27;re constantly working to improve the experience in Forza Horizon 5&quot; - Horizon Open has been updated with a new progression system &quot;including badges which can unlocked through gameplay&quot;.
There&#x27;s also custom racing, which allows players to find races &quot;for their chosen race discipline and PI class&quot;, as well as fixes to some scenarios where &quot;the player could be left waiting longer than necessary in the post-race flow&quot;.

                              <span>Valve is seeking your feedback about your experiences with &quot;verified&quot; Steam games thus far on Steam Deck.
The lucky souls who managed to snag an early Steam Deck pre-order have had their units for a few weeks now, and consequently, Valve would like to know how they&#x27;re finding it, particularly if you&#x27;re playing games that have been marked as &quot;verified&quot; - that is, games that had been tested and deemed to run smoothly and without glitches or bugs. 
&quot;The initial data we&#x27;re gathering in this way is about titles that are Steam Deck Verified,&quot; Valve explains. &quot;We&#x27;re able to collect objective data (crashes, etc.) to help us understand how well the technical side of our review process is working, but ultimately the Deck compatibility ratings are about the overall experience: the definition of &#x27;working well&#x27; is succeeding at enabling current and future Deck customers to find the experiences they want.
