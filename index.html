                    <span>It doesn&#x27;t sound like Square Enix will show Final Fantasy 16 at the Tokyo Game Show.
In conversation with Nier chief Yoko Taro during a special Final Fantasy 14 livestream, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida indicated the hotly-anticipated game will skip this year&#x27;s TGS, which kicks off at the end of September.
In comments translated by Twitter user @aitaikimochi and Siliconera, Yoshida said the team wants to show Final Fantasy 16 shortly before the game launches, rather than drip feed fans snippets of information over a long period of time.

                    <span>Japanese police have arrested a man allegedly selling modified The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild save files.
According to Broadcasting System of Niigata (BSN) (thanks, Dexerto), Niigata Prefectural Police arrested a 27-year-old Chinese man living in Tokyo on 8th July for selling the cheat saves.

That figure comfortably beats the previous world record price for a video game, set by an unopened copy of Super Mario Bros. that went for $660,000 earlier this year.
Dallas, Texas-based Heritage Auctions said this cart is an early production copy of the first game in the Zelda series, and &quot;is no doubt the apotheosis of rarity, cultural significance, and collection centerpieces&quot;.

                    <span>Following its entirely underwhelming first footage reveal of The Witcher TV show&#x27;s second season earlier this year (all 12 seconds of it), Netflix has finally shared a first proper trailer for Season 2 as its newly confirmed 17th December release draws nearer. And here it is now!
As part of tonight&#x27;s WitcherCon, a livestream collaboration between CD Projekt and Netflix, the streaming service has announced that the long-awaited second season of its live-action Witcher TV series will arrive on 17th December this year.
That means fans will have been waiting almost exactly two years by the time Season 2 arrives (its predecessor debuted in December 2019), with the long gap between seasons largely the result of coronavirus-related filming delays. With filming wrapped and post-production now well underway, though, Netflix is finally ready to talk specifics and has confirmed Season 2 will once again consist of eight episodes, all of which have now had their official names revealed.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s animated Witcher movie, Nightmare of the Wolf, will officially arrive on 23rd August, and there&#x27;s a first look at its action in a new teaser trailer to celebrate the news.
Announced back at the start of last year, Nightmare of the Wolf focusses on Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s friend and mentor Vesemir, and is set &quot;long before&quot; the two meet. In fact, previous word from Netflix suggests it&#x27;ll wind the action all the way back to the start of Vesemir&#x27;s journey as a Witcher, &quot;after the mysterious Deglan claims him through the Law of Surprise&quot;.
And if that&#x27;s left you sufficiently intrigued, you can see Netflix&#x27;s first teaser trailer for Nightmare of the Wolf below. Animation is being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind Legend of Korra - while Lauren S. Hissrich and Beau DeMayo, respectively showrunner and writer on the main live-action Witcher series, are both involved.

                    <span>A video game collector has come across what is believed to be evidence of the &quot;SNK Millennium&quot; console - 20 years after it was rumoured to be in the works.
Anthony Bacon, from Chicago (who we&#x27;ve featured multiple times on Eurogamer before), was sent a mystery SNK motherboard earlier this year and asked to investigate by its owner.
This board had a long journey to Bacon&#x27;s desk. His friend, Brian Hargrove, bought a lot of SNK motherboards from Yahoo Auctions Japan 15 years ago, not having any idea what they were. He sold the board in question to a friend of his called Max, who five months ago contacted Bacon to ask if he could work out what it was.

                    <span>Snowman and Land &amp; Sea has announced that Alto&#x27;s Odyssey, the endless sand-surfing game from 2018, is getting a special edition. Alto&#x27;s Odyssey: The Lost City comes to Apple Arcade on 16th July.
The Lost City is a sort of revisiting of the original game, allowing players to &quot;venture deeper into the endless desert to uncover its best-kept secret.&quot; The game adds a new biome - the Lost city - and expands upon the original design with new secrets and challenges. The idea is to give returning players something fresh to tease at, while allowing new players to see what the game&#x27;s all about in the first place.
The teaser trailer promises lavish mystery and paper lanterns - always a lovely mix. If you have played the original game, your save data will carry across too, which is pretty great. Can&#x27;t wait for this one.

In a message to fans, Lanning today thanked the Oddworld series&#x27; community for their feedback and patience while the latest game in the series was improved. 
Now, seven updates later, Soulstorm stands &quot;refined&quot;, Lanning said. &quot;Major fixes&quot; include updates to Abe&#x27;s movement, aim, and stealth. Enemy AI has been improved, and several levels have been rebalanced. The game&#x27;s PlayStation 5 trophies have been rejigged, and DualSense support now extends to being able to feel Abe&#x27;s heartbeat at times of stress.

                    <span>Sony has removed a PlayStation 5 advert which showed the console placed upside down.
Fans spotted the incorrectly-positioned PS5 in the video yesterday, posted to Twitter. Overnight, the advert was quietly deleted from the internet.
The heartwarming ad began with a dad telling his son a bedtime story. Thinking of his current God of War playthrough, the dad starts telling his son a tale of how a father and son went for a walk in the mountains. The cherubic child quickly falls asleep.

                    <span>Arkane Studios, the developer behind the likes of Dishonored and Prey, has been teasing Deathloop for quite some time now, and the wonderfully stylish recursive stealth shooter has looked captivating at every turn. And the tantalising glimpses continued tonight with nine new minutes of gameplay footage, as shown during Sony&#x27;s latest PlayStation State of Play.
First, the basic premise for those unfamiliar; in Deathloop, players take on the role of Colt, an assassin who finds himself trapped in an endless time loop on the mysterious Blackreef island. In order to escape, he&#x27;ll need to take out eight targets known as the Visionaries before the day ends - but if he fails (or dies) time rewinds and he&#x27;ll need to start over.
All isn&#x27;t lost, however; by exploring further in each successive loop, players can gain valuable clues they&#x27;ll be able to use next time around to locate and eliminate their targets before the day ends - and Arkane&#x27;s latest gameplay footage focusses on an attempt to bring down the Visionary known as Aleksis &quot;The Wolf&quot; Dorsey.

This expanded version of Hideo Kojima&#x27;s oddball post-apocalyptic courier adventure adds new story missions, new combat mechanics, a firing range and... a racing mode.
Combat has been expanded with upgraded melee attacks, a laser gun and mounted machine guns. There&#x27;s also a cargo gun that launches packages over long distances, a support skeleton to let you carry even more, and a cute buddy bot who can carry loads and run alongside you.

                    <span>Developer Megagon Industries&#x27; wonderfully serene (and deliciously infuriating) mountain bike adventure Lonely Mountains: Downhill is a brilliant thing, but given that it&#x27;s also a year and a half old now, fans may be hoping for a bit of a shake-up. And what do you know? Megagon&#x27;s newest update is here to do just that, wafting away the threat of encroaching staleness with a range of new Daily Ride challenge modifiers.
Daily Rides, if you&#x27;ve not yet checked them out, are daily cross-platform leaderboards that challenge players to do their best in a randomly selected trial, with participants able to unlock various cosmetic rewards, refreshed each season, along the way. Today&#x27;s update marks the start of Lonely Mountains&#x27; seventh season, Summer Strolls, and introduces those aforementioned modifiers to freshen things up for players.
Today&#x27;s Daily Ride, for instance, rolls out the new Changed Checkpoints modifier - which, as its name suggests, changes and adds new checkpoints to the trail - but future modifiers for the season have also been revealed (and you can see a few of them in the trailer below).

                    <span>Rockstar has started removing GTA Online jobs.
Rockstar warned jobs such as races, missions, adversary modes and survivals will be cycled in and out over time as they add more to the game.
We&#x27;ve verified the Bombushka Run Adversary Mode is currently not in GTA Online. Bombushka Run was added to GTA Online as part of the continuation of the Smuggler&#x27;s Run update in September 2017.

                    <span>Sam &amp; Max: This Time It&#x27;s Virtual, the wise-cracking anthropomorphic crime-fighting duo&#x27;s (presumably very silly) plunge into the world of VR, is - after a short delay from its originally announced June launch window - out today on Oculus Quest.
This Time It&#x27;s Virtual (Sam &amp; Max&#x27;s first entirely new video game outing since Telltale Games&#x27; The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse in 2010) is the work of developer HappyGiant, which promisingly includes Sam &amp; Max creator Steve Purcell and a number of ex-LucasArts alumni who all worked on the studio&#x27;s seminal 1993 point-and-click adventure Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road - writer/designer Mike Stemmle, creative director Mike Levine, and concept artist Peter Chan.
Additionally, David Nowlin and Dave Boat, who&#x27;ve voiced Sam and Max previously in a number of Telltale titles, are reprising their roles as the dubious dog and bunny duo.

It arrives in an update-filled Access All Areas edition, which includes the various additions brought into the game since its original launch a year ago as an Epic Games Store timed exclusive.
There&#x27;s a four-player story campaign and the usual competitive multiplayer mode, too.

As Eurogamer reported last week, a recent Guilty Gear Strive patch stealth removed reference to Uyghur, Tibet and Taiwan in a China-related lore entry.
Neither Guilty Gear Strive publisher Bandai Namco nor developer Arc System Works have commented, despite repeated requests from Eurogamer.

The in-development cheat, brought to light by the Anti-Cheat Police Department Twitter account this week, claims to use machine learning to analyse gameplay footage in real-time before sending inputs to your controller.
Eurogamer will not disclose the name of the cheat or publish the original video.

The Los Angeles-based studio has previously assisted DICE on its Battlefield series, and is doing so again with the upcoming Battlefield 2042 - more on that below.
But Ripple Effect Studios is also now creating its own new project, after Vince Zampella, boss of Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order developer Respawn Entertainment, took on an expanded role in January as &quot;head coach&quot; of the now-renamed team.

                    <span>Capcom has now sold 4.5m copies of Resident Evil Village. 
That&#x27;s a steady uptick from the last couple of sales milestones announced by the publisher - 3m at launch in May, then up to 4m after 20 days. 
Village&#x27;s predecessor Resident Evil 7 has shifted 9m copies since its launch in 2017, though only sold 3.5m after nine weeks. Village is selling faster, then, and looks on track to potentially overtake 7 as the biggest-selling entry in the series.

&quot;It&#x27;s a MASSIVE win for a minority language and one of many I hope!&quot; Úna-Minh Kavanagh, who spearheaded the project, said in a post on Twitter.

                    <span>Dark Souls 3 has just received a new lease of life on Xbox Series consoles, thanks to the transformative powers of FPS Boost. The From Software classic now targets 60 frames per second on the new wave of Microsoft consoles, replacing the somewhat wobbly 30fps of the Xbox One rendition of the game. We had early access to the FPS Boosted rendition of the game and it certainly does the job, delivering nigh-on flawless performance on Xbox Series consoles.
This is a much-requested upgrade for Xbox Series X and S owners, bringing the game closer into line with its performance profile on PS5. Dark Souls 3 released on last-gen systems in 2016 with a firm 30fps cap, but many months later, a PlayStation 4 Pro patch removed the limit, offering frame-rates up to 60fps. Unfortunately, the value of the upgrade was questionable at the time, owing to a highly variable level of performance on Sony&#x27;s enhanced machine. However, in the long run, it worked out - PlayStation 5&#x27;s backwards compatibility horsepower locks the game to 1080p60.
Unfortunately, From Software never went back to the Xbox One version of Dark Souls 3 to add One X support, meaning that 900p30 has been the upper limit of performance on Xbox consoles since the game&#x27;s original launch. Not only that, in common with From&#x27;s other 30fps console offerings, inconsistent frame-pacing added a certain degree of judder to the game, something baked into the engine that extra back-compat horsepower could not address. Today&#x27;s FPS Boost upgrade overrides the frame-rate cap to give Xbox Series X and S the same, smooth experience 60fps as PS5, with no judder, hitches or stuttering.

                    <span>ArsTechnica has a good story on the REvil ransomware attack of last weekend, with technical details:
This weekend’s attack was carried out with almost surgical precision. According to Cybereason, the REvil affiliates first gained access to targeted environments and then used the zero-day in the Kaseya Agent Monitor to gain administrative control over the target’s network. After writing a base-64-encoded payload to a file named agent.crt the dropper executed it.
[…]
The ransomware dropper Agent.exe is signed with a Windows-trusted certificate that uses the registrant name “PB03 TRANSPORT LTD.” By digitally signing their malware, attackers are able to suppress many security warnings that would otherwise appear when it’s being installed. Cybereason said that the certificate appears to have been used exclusively by REvil malware that was deployed during this attack...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait, but console fans of 11 Bit Studios&#x27; celebrated post-apocalyptic city builder Frostpunk will finally be able to get their hands on Xbox and Playstation versions of the game&#x27;s three expansions from Wednesday, 26th June. 
Frostpunk launched on consoles toward the end of 2019, introducing its narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder - in which players must overcome gruelling conditions to keep their fledgling community alive in a desolate sub-zero world - to a legion of new fans.
Since then, three distinctive expansions have released on PC, building upon Frostpunk&#x27;s punishing but wonderfully compelling core in interesting new ways, and it&#x27;s these that will finally debut on consoles later this month.

                    <span>Switch owners with a taste for cracking yarns, urban fantasy, and a smattering of demonic possession have a bit of a treat in store; developer Wadjet Eye&#x27;s superb point-and-click adventure Unavowed is available on Nintendo&#x27;s platform from today.
Unavowed - which is the work of Dave Gilbert, the designer behind Wadjet Eye&#x27;s renowned Blackwell series - was enormously well-received when it released on PC back in 2018, receiving much acclaim for its ambitious structure and wonderfully compelling storyline.
It sees players taking on the role of a (somewhat definable) character who&#x27;s spent the last year terrorising New York City in a demonically possessed frenzy - and who now, after intervention from a crack team of supernatural specialists, finds themselves in the employ of an ancient, evil-battling secret society and ready to put their recent mistakes right.

                    <span>Konami has cancelled its contract with Antoine Griezmann after a video in which the France and Barcelona star appears to ridicule Asian hotel staff resurfaced this week.
The Snapchat video, which appears to show Griezmann as well as teammate Ousmane Dembele mocking Asian technicians during Barcelona&#x27;s tour of Japan in 2019, has sparked a vociferous backlash amid racism allegations.
According to ESPN, in the video Dembele says to Griezmann: &quot;All these ugly faces, just so you can play PES, aren&#x27;t you ashamed?&quot;

                    <span>A popular third-party Call of Duty: Warzone stats tracker app is back online after its creators held successful talks with Activision.
Warzone Tracker was one of a number of overlay apps on the Overwolf network that were disabled earlier this year following an update to the battle royale.
This update, issued in response to an Activision API terms of service breach by a separate app on the Overwolf framework, had the knock-on effect of blocking Overwolf entirely, preventing its use while the PC version of Warzone was in use.

The lengthy blog post contains mention of two teams led by two creative directors. Clint Hocking, formerly of Splinter Cell and Watch Dogs Legion, will lead a team at Ubisoft Montreal. Jonathan Dumont, a veteran of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate and Odyssey, will lead a team at Ubisoft Quebec.
The Infinity project that will include the games made by both these teams will be led by Marc-Alexis Côté, who will now serve as executive producer of the entire Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise. Côté worked on Brotherhood before becoming creative director on Syndicate, and is one of the most senior staff at Ubisoft Quebec.

EA told GamesIndustry.biz the pair&#x27;s departure has &quot;always been part of the plan&quot;, but was brought forward due to the speed of Codies&#x27; integration into EA.
F1 developer Codemasters and Project Cars developer Slight Mad, which Codies bought in November 2019, are being made a part of EA Sports, which is publishing F1 2021 next week.

We then see the Lieutenant of Barad-dûr, aka Mouth of Sauron, for the first time:

                    <span>Publisher Nacon has delayed the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong. Originally scheduled to arrive this year, the narrative RPG is now due to launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and PC in February 2022.
Swansong, which was announced back in 2019, is the work of Big Bad Wolf, the studio behind episodic adventure game The Council, and places players into the shoes of three different vampires, each belonging to a different clan within the vampire sect of The Camarilla.
&quot;Weaving between their intertwined tales,&quot; Nacon explained at the time of Swansong&#x27;s reveal, &quot;the player has to confront the different points of view of his characters to unravel fact from fiction. With whispers of conspiracy, murder and power struggles, the player must protect his clan, discover the truth and above all enforce the Masquerade, the vampire law designed to conceal the existence of creatures of the night from humans.&quot;

                    <span>Spiders - the French studio behind the scrappy but lovable RPG likes of GreedFall and The Technomacer - has shared first gameplay footage of its offbeat new action-RPG, Steelrising.
Steelrising, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, features a deliciously high-concept premise, unfolding in a heavily reimagined version of 18th century Paris, where players are cast as Aegis, one of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s automaton bodyguards, and charged with tracking down their maker in a bid to stop Louis XVI&#x27;s army of rogue robots.
Steelrising got its big reveal last summer, when Spiders shared a wonderfully atmospheric teaser trailer offering a glimpse of Paris&#x27; battle-ravaged streets and glorious automaton creations. And now, following a second cinematic trailer in June, the developer has provided a first look at Steelrising&#x27;s gameplay, predominantly focussing on its flashy third-person combat.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been quite some time since iconic 80s action-movie antihero RoboCop had a video game to call his own (he last appeared on PC and consoles over 18 years ago, re-emerging with a free-to-play mobile offering in 2014), but it&#x27;s been revealed everybody&#x27;s favourite cyborg security professional will be making a long-awaited gaming comeback in RoboCop: Rogue City.
RoboCop: Rogue City, which is set for release on PC and currently unannounced consoles some time in 2023, is the work of developer Teyon (the studio responsible for the critically savaged Terminator: Resistance and Rambo: The Video Game), and will feature an &quot;original story&quot; based on the events of the first three RoboCop films.
Beyond the fact that players will take on the role of  RoboCop himself - &quot;Become the iconic hero whose [sic] part man, part machine, all cop as you attempt to bring justice to the dangerous, crime-ridden streets of Old Detroit in RoboCop: Rogue City,&quot; teases publisher Nacon in its press release - specifics are currently a little scarce.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve known for a while that Kylotonn Racing is working on an all-new Test Drive Unlimited, and now we finally know where it&#x27;ll be set, with Hong Kong set to be the backdrop for the open world racer. 
The location was revealed in today&#x27;s Nacon Connect with another CGI trailer which teased some further details including a doubling down on the bling-obsessed lifestyle elements. We also got to see what the backdrop of Hong Kong will offer, from its muddy shores to its hyper-colourful streets through to its glorious hills. 
Hong Kong has been a popular destination for previous video games, of course, from Shenmue 2 to the beloved Sleeping Dogs. It follows on from Test Drive Unlimited&#x27;s Oahu setting, while its sequel headed to Ibiza (and missed out on the opportunity for a Wayne Lineker cameo - for shame).

The Witcher: Blood Origin is a new six-part series set 1,200 years before Netflix&#x27;s Henry-Cavill-starring main Witcher show and will chart the creation of the prototype Witcher, as well as the events leading to the &quot;pivotal&quot; Conjunction of the Spheres - in which a collision of different realms brought monsters into the world. 
Lauren S. Hissrich, showrunner on Netflix&#x27;s mainline Witcher series, will executive produce Blood Origin, and Declan de Barra - who penned The Witcher Season 1&#x27;s &quot;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials&quot; episode - will serve as writer and showrunner on the prequel.

In a tweet, SNK confirmed the launch platforms for the upcoming fighting game, which was recently delayed to Q1 2022 due to production issues associated with rising cases of COVID-19 in Japan.
King of Fighters 15 is due out on PC via Windows 10, Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox Series X and S. Xbox One and Nintendo Switch are not on the list.

                    <span>England star Marcus Rashford has thanked a young fan for his fundraising work in a letter accompanied by a PlayStation 5 and copy of FIFA 2021. 
Nine-year-old Jacob Worthington, from St Helens, was originally inspired by the England and Manchester United forward to raise money for FareShare, a charity Rashford supports.
Setting a 20km target over four runs, Manchester United fan Jacob and his father created an Instagram account to help gain sponsorships and document the process.

                    <span>Surprise! Or not. Nintendo has at last unveiled its upgraded Switch model, which is due to launch on 8th October alongside Metroid Dread. It has a 7-inch OLED screen, 64GB of internal storage, a wide adjustable stand plus improved speakers.
There&#x27;s a new dock, too, with a wired LAN port.  White and neon red/blue colours will be available. Officially, it&#x27;s called the Nintendo Switch (OLED model) console. In the US it costs $350. In the UK, we&#x27;re yet to see local pricing.
We and others had expected Nintendo to push the button (flip the Switch?) and reveal its new model before E3. Nintendo really doesn&#x27;t like leaks! Anyway, on time or not, here we are:

&quot;Successful&quot; games with a &quot;loyal user base&quot; are not affected, Atari insisted.

Here are the patch notes for version 12.1.0:
A minor update for Switch then, but a useful one. Prior to this update, users would sometimes need to delete games to make room for big patches.

The password generator included in Kaspersky Password Manager had several problems. The most critical one is that it used a PRNG not suited for cryptographic purposes. Its single source of entropy was the current time. All the passwords it created could be bruteforced in seconds. This article explains how to securely generate passwords, why Kaspersky Password Manager failed, and how to exploit this flaw. It also provides a proof of concept to test if your version is vulnerable...</span>

                    <span>RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, has announced a second paid expansion, titled Ideology, which&#x27;ll be arriving in the next few weeks alongside a substantial free content update for all players.
Following on from last year&#x27;s Royalty DLC, Ideology aims to enhance RimWorld&#x27;s celebrated core by providing the tools needed to fashion a specific belief system for your colony. &quot;You can play as tree-worshipping cannibals who carve skulls into every piece of furniture,&quot; explains developer Tynan Sylvester on Steam, &quot;or blind tunnelers who shun the light, or transhumanists obsessed with perfecting the human form using exotic technology. Or be nudists, or drug-stupor mystics, or piratical raiders, or charity-focused givers, or pain-loving animal sacrificers, or dance-party techno ravers, or rustic ranching cowboys, or many many more.&quot;
Sylvester says it&#x27;ll be possible to mix and match different core elements of a colony&#x27;s belief system in Ideology, and that customisation can be taken even further if desired, with the expansion enabling players to individually adjust preferences in the following categories: precept, ritual, special social role, venerated animal and weapon, culture and style, unique building, tattoo, clothing, background narrative, god, and, perhaps most importantly of all, beard (more on those shortly!).

The action-adventure game will be available on Tuesday, 6th June.
Judgment, from the same team that created the Yakuza series, is a spin off series that follows a detective investigating a string of murders. The game will be available for three months, from 6th June until the 4th October 2021.

                    <span>The next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series will not release anytime soon, according to reports. 
Grand Theft Auto 6 is still at least three or four years away, according to Battlefield insider Tom Henderson, who last week suggested GTA6 would not see a release until at least 2024 or 2025. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has now said he has heard similar.
The long wait, Henderson said, was due to a push within developer Rockstar to improve staff welfare and avoid the levels of crunch which have plagued the company over past releases. It is also, Henderson continued, because Rockstar wants to launch GTA6 at a time when the install base for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has grown considerably.

                    <span>An article published over the weekend includes interviews with former and currently serving members of the US armed forces who played Pokémon Go while stationed on the base at Bagram Airfield, near Kabul, over the past few years.
According to the story, the base previously hosted a &quot;thriving&quot; Pokémon Go community made up of troops, contractors and visiting civilians &quot;who played the game while exercising and after work&quot;.

                    <span>Ubisoft has pulled Might &amp; Magic 10 - Legacy from sale following a backlash to its server shutdown.
Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for the game - leaving some unable to access significant portions of its single-player content and its DLC.
And, as Emma reported last month, despite these issues, the game and its DLC were left on sale. No more.

                    <span>A new mod for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition has fixed the series&#x27; infamous save bug involving Conrad Verner - the infamous Shepard fan who loves to bug you.
The glitch caused Mass Effect 2 to incorrectly remember how you had treated Verner in Mass Effect 1, if you were nice to him. Catching up with Verner a second time, he would always react like you had put a gun in his face to get him to desist from acting like a trained N7 recruit for his own good. 
BioWare likely left this bug unpatched in the Legendary Edition as it later retconned Verner&#x27;s glitched response in Mass Effect 3, where Verner apologises if he had misremembered Shepard&#x27;s earlier actions.

                    <span>Final Fantasy 14 broke its Steam concurrent players record over the weekend.
Square Enix&#x27;s long-running MMO hit 47,542 concurrent players on Steam over the weekend, according to official stats provided by Valve&#x27;s platform.
That beats the game&#x27;s previous record of 41,200, set in June 2019 just ahead of the Shadowbringers expansion.

                    <span>Dragon Age and Mass Effect would skip this month&#x27;s EA Play Live. Now, executive producer Christian Dailey has reassured fans that the game is &quot;making great progress&quot;, and provided a new piece of concept art.
The image shows a group of stylish caped figures, who fans will recognise as the Antivan Crows (their sigil in the bottom right confirms this).
Antivan Crows have briefly popped up in the series before (Zevran was a Crow recruit way back in Dragon Age 1), as well as its spin-off comics and novels.

                    <span>Titanfall fans have hacked Apex Legends in an effort to flag the attention of developer Respawn.
Log into Apex Legends on PC right now and instead of the usual playlists, you&#x27;ll get the URL &quot;savetitanfall.com&quot; with the subheader, &quot;[Titanfall 1] is being attacked so is Apex&quot;.
Players are also getting an &quot;important message&quot; at the end of each match that requests players &quot;visit and report savetitanfall.com&quot;, a website that&#x27;s been online since at least March 2021. Affected players are seemingly unable to access other game modes, essentially blocking them from playing at all.

                    <span>Sharkmob has updated the system requirements for its upcoming vampire-themed battle royale, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt.
Confirmation comes following a closed alpha beta test for the free-to-play game which ended earlier today.
While previously it was recommended players used a GTX 970 or RX 590, now Sharkmob suggests players use either a GTX 1070, RX 5600 XT or better for graphics,  and a SSD is &quot;strongly recommended&quot; even in the minimum spec. You&#x27;ll need around 20GB of storage, too.

As described by the trademark organisation itself, The mark consists of the word &quot;THE on top of the words DARK PICTURES, stacked on top of the words THE DEVIL IN ME&quot;.

                    <span>Dead By Daylight has hit a new record of over 100,000 concurrent players on PC during its fifth anniversary celebrations.
The new record - which coincided with a 40 per cent off Steam sale and the recent release of a bunch of Resident Evil-themed goodies, including new skins and a new killer - saw 105,093 players jump on Steam at the same time, according to SteamDB.
The milestone also comes at the same time the asymmetric horror game, developed by Behaviour Interactive, is running an time-limited event from now until 15th July, during which there&#x27;s a load of new content up for grabs, including anniversary crowns, community challenges, and enough Iridescent Shards for all players to purchase an &quot;entire original character&quot; of their choice.

                    <span>A sealed, rare variant of Nintendo&#x27;s 1987 classic The Legend of Zelda is currently for sale via auction. At the time of writing, with five days left to go on the auction, the lot has a current bid of $110,000 (£72,300).
This lot, called a &quot;NES R&quot; variant, is particularly significant because this version was &quot;only produced for a few months in late 1987&quot;. Rev-A replaced it in early 1988.
The only version considered more valuable than this one is a &quot;NES TM&quot;, and there&#x27;s reportedly only one sealed copy in existence &quot;and there is no telling whether or not that copy will ever come to market&quot;. Therefore, this cartridge is likely &quot;the earliest sealed copy one could realistically hope to obtain&quot; and sits at a grading - or wata rating - of 9.

                    <span>Nightdive Studios has published seven minutes of gameplay of its System Shock remake.
The System Shock video, below, includes plenty of skulking about in the Research level of Citadel Station.
I think it looks pretty impressive - the visuals are appropriately atmospheric, with plenty of sparky visual effects. There&#x27;s a sense of foreboding, which System Shock should have. We see enemies who lurch towards the player once they&#x27;re disturbed. The video ends with a quite terrifying fight against a large robot who takes an age to go down.

                    <span>Guild Wars 2 developer ArenaNet has issued an update on the studio and its long-running MMO.
The headline announcement is the End of Dragons expansion has been delayed from late 2021 to early 2022. In a post on the Guild Wars 2 website, ArenaNet director John Taylor explained the delay:
&quot;As expansion development has progressed and the real-world challenges of the past year and a half have changed the way we live and work, it&#x27;s become clear that we need a little more time to deliver our creative vision for Cantha. As a result, we&#x27;re delaying the release of Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons from late 2021 to early 2022.

                    <span>A Guilty Gear Strive patch stealth removed reference to Uyghur, Tibet and Taiwan in a China-related lore entry.
The change was highlighted on the ResetEra forum on 21st June after it bubbled up on Strive&#x27;s Steam forum following a patch issued on 18th June that brought Strive up to v1.03.
Neither Guilty Gear Strive publisher Bandai Namco or developer Arc System Works have commented, despite repeated requests from Eurogamer after the change emerged.

                    <span>Faze Clan has kicked out one of its members and suspended three others over an alleged influencer crypto &quot;scam&quot;.
In a statement published to Twitter, Faze said it had &quot;removed&quot; Frazier Kay from its clan, and suspended Jarvis Khattri, Nikan Nadim and Teeqo until further notice.
These influencers, each with millions of YouTube subscribers and social media followers, were heavily criticised for promoting a cryptocurrency token called Save the Kids whose value plummeted soon after it launched.

                    <span>Dark Alliance got its first big update today - and its patch notes are frustratingly vague.
The Dungeons &amp; Dragons action role-playing game launched on 22nd June and was met with a mixed reception, so there are a lot of eyeballs on this first patch to see if it remedies some of the game&#x27;s more immediate issues.
Unfortunately, developer Tuque Games&#x27; patch notes for Dark Alliance v1.16 are so vague, players are struggling to work out what the update actually does.

                    <span>Mortal Kombat 11 DLC has come to an end, NetherRealm has confirmed.
The studio will now focus on its next project, it said in a tweet.
The confirmation comes as no surprise to Mortal Kombat fans - the fighting game last saw new DLC characters in November last year, when Kombat Pack 2 added John Rambo, Mileena and Rain to the fighting game.

                    <span>Doom Eternal will no longer receive its previously announced PvP-focussed Invasions mode, with id Software having made the decision to pivot development toward a new single-player horde mode instead, due to coronavirus-related development challenges.
Invasions Mode, announced back at QuakeCon 2018, was intended to deliver a vaguely Dark-Souls-esque multiplayer spin on Doom Eternal&#x27;s single-player campaign, enabling other humans to manifest as demons throughout the story and do battle with the host player for some added challenge.
Well over 12 months after Doom Eternal&#x27;s March 2020 launch, however, Invasions Mode is still yet to materialise, leaving fans to ponder its fate. And now, in a newly released statement, id Software executive producer Marty Stratton has provided an answer, confirming Invasions Mode is officially dead due to the impact &quot;the unforeseen consequences of the pandemic and remote working&quot; have had on development.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, the second game in Capcom&#x27;s RPG spin-off series, comes to Switch and PC next Friday, 9th July, and, much like its mainline sibling, will enjoy a healthy dose of post-launch support. And now, with its arrival in sight, Capcom has shared a roadmap outlining those post-release content plans.
One week after Monster Hunter Stories 2&#x27;s launch, Capcom will deploy its first (and previously detailed) post-launch update, introducing introducing Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s dog-like Palamute companion as a rideable Monstie.
That&#x27;ll be followed by a second update on 5th August introducing Hellblade Glavenus and Boltreaver Astalos as new Monsties, alongside a new co-op quest - featuring the gilded Elder Dragon Kulve Taroth - that Monster Riders can tackle together. Capcom notes that while the Elder Dragon won&#x27;t be rideable, materials gained from the quest can be used to craft &quot;powerful&quot; new equipment.

                    <span>Nexus Mods has announced that mod authors will soon be unable to delete mod files from the website, a change being made ahead of the introduction of its new collections system. 
The news was announced via a blog post, where the company explained that the change was necessary for the implementation of its collections system. From now on, mod files will be archived instead of deleted, which will make them &quot;inaccessible unless directly requested eg. via the API.&quot;
&quot;It is our core belief that making modding easier is a noble goal, so more people can enjoy our joint hobby,&quot; Nexus Mods said. &quot;We are convinced that our collections system, a project we have spent almost two years and many work-hours on, is the way to achieve this goal.&quot;

                    <span>Humble Bundle faced criticism earlier this year when it tried to remove charity sliders from its bundle pages, a decision that would have severely limited the amount players could donate to charity for their purchases. Following significant backlash, Humble Bundle decided to reverse this decision and reinstate the sliders - but it&#x27;s once again placing limits on how much can be donated to charity. 
In a blog post, Humble Bundle announced it will be rolling out a &quot;new iteration&quot; of sliders in mid-July. &quot;While splits on each bundle will vary, on average there will be a minimum amount for Humble Bundle between 15-30 percent,&quot; the post said. This means users will no longer be able to donate the entire amount to charity, although the company said there will continue to be some &quot;100 percent to charity bundles&quot;. 
The company explained that the &quot;PC storefront landscape has changed significantly&quot; since the bundles began in 2010, and it had to &quot;continue to evolve with it to stay on mission.

Monster Slayer is set long before the main Witcher games, meaning you need to step up and take on the fantasy world&#x27;s many beasties yourself. 
CD Projekt first announced Monster Slayer in August last year, and said that its mobile studio Spokko was on development duties. It promised &quot;rich, story-driven quests&quot; and first-person monster battles impacted by your local time of day and weather. So, rain.

Venturebeat - which first reported on potential plans for a deal between the two back in April - say discussions have now progressed to the stage that a letter of intent has been signed while legal teams hash out the finer details. 
This leaves development work to continue (and Xbox boss Phil Spencer to continue displaying a Kojima Productions figurine on his shelf) in the meantime.

                    <span>Star Wars: The Old Republic has been around for some time now - nearly 10 years, in fact - and to mark the occasion the game is getting another expansion. 
The new expansion, titled Legacy of the Sith, was announced in a livestream last night. It&#x27;s due to add a mixture of additional story content, player rewards and new gameplay features.  
&quot;The war between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire spreads to new worlds,&quot; the announcement post explains. &quot;Dangerous fringe groups rise in the dark corners of the galaxy ​and Darth Malgus pursues an unknown plan...

PlayStation confirmed the situation in an update to its support page for discontinued apps and services this week, first noticed by ResetEra, and then confirmed by Kotaku.
So, while the PSP will still lose its purchasing functionality as planned, PSP games will still be available to play - a key concern among fans worried over Sony&#x27;s perceived lack of care for game preservation.

                    <span>One of the many highlights of Satoru Iwata&#x27;s reign at Nintendo was his series of Iwata Asks interviews - intimate, insightful and always entertaining chats between the president and the developers that started in the Wii era and carried on until Iwata&#x27;s untimely death in 2015, they&#x27;re some of the finest pieces of games journalism online. 
After an understandable hiatus, Nintendo has introduced a new similarly-themed series simply called &#x27;Ask the Developer&#x27;, with the first installment focussing on the recently released Game Builder Garage. It&#x27;s a gentle, informative and enlightening read, even if it&#x27;s short on any major revelations (although it&#x27;s opened my eyes to the stylish lab coats all Nintendo developers seem to wear at the moment). 
The interview comes as Game Builder Garage gets a free demo on Nintendo Switch, with the first of its seven lessons now available to download from the eShop.

                    <span>Mario Kart Live Home Circuit, the curious and enjoyable AR-offshoot for Nintendo&#x27;s much-loved racing series that first released in October last year, has just got a substantial new update that introduces a whole new cup and various other elements. 
The 1.1.0 update, which went live yesterday, introduces the all-new Mario Cup, and upon its completion you&#x27;re given access to new environments and gates to use in your course creations. There&#x27;s also new kart elements, with &#x27;Super Yoshi&#x27; and &#x27;Yoshi Horn&#x27; up for grabs. 
Mario Kart Live Home Circuit was the work of Velan Studios, who&#x27;ve gone on to find further success with this year&#x27;s Knockout City. Home Circuit wasn&#x27;t without its limitations, but it was still a fascinating and frequently charming thing.  &quot;A neatly crafted gizmo, and a fresh reminder that Nintendo remains a toymaker at heart,&quot; we wrote in our Mario Kart Live Home Circuit review.

                    <span>From the New York Times: “When an Eel Climbs a Ramp to Eat Squid From a Clamp, That’s a Moray.” The article is about the eel; the squid is just eel food. But still….
As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

As part of our investigation into this ongoing activity, we also detected information-stealing malware on a machine belonging to one of our customer support agents with access to basic account information for a small number of our customers. The actor used this information in some cases to launch highly-targeted attacks as part of their broader campaign.

The second is from the NSA, CISA, FBI, and the UK’s NCSC, which wrote that the GRU is continuing to conduct brute-force password guessing attacks around the world, and is in some cases successful. From the ...</span>

                    <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator is gorgeous but notoriously demanding of PC hardware; however, developer Asobo says it&#x27;ll be getting a whole lot less demanding when its next Sim Update arrives alongside the game&#x27;s highly anticipated Xbox Series X/S release on 27th July.
Asobo offered a look the huge performance improvements coming to Microsoft Flight Simulator on PC during its latest developer livestream, with CEO Sebastian Wloch explaining the team has rewritten &quot;a lot of the parts of the engine...in order to get the maximum performance out of the sim&quot;, as part of its work on the upcoming console version.
To illustrate just how effective Asobo&#x27;s engine tweaks have been, Wloch demoed a before-and-after gameplay video featuring a flyover of Manhattan, captured from a PC equipped with an i7-9700K CPU and Nvidia 2060 Super graphics card - and running Flight Simulator at Ultra settings in 4K with a 40% render scale (jump to the 8-minute mark below to see the footage).

                    <span>What better way to enjoy the summer months than an escape to the countryside for some idyllic cottage living? And what better way to do it without the inconvenience of ever actually having to leave your house than with the Sim&#x27;s 4&#x27;s latest expansion?
The Sims 4: Cottage Living, which arrives on 22nd July, is the tenth full-scale Expansion Pack (and 42nd bit of paid DLC) to launch for life sim since its release in 2014, and - as its name very much implies - is all about cosy cottages and rustic charm.
Unsurprisingly, top of the list of features coming in Cottage Living is the ability to settle down in a charmingly rustic new abode. Here, players can befriend the likes of wild rabbits, foxes, and birds, while also raising their own animals - including llamas, chickens, and cows for wool, eggs, and milk respectively - in order to start their journey to self-sufficiency.

                    <span>Having spent some time percolating in the rumour pool (and occasionally leaking onto various ratings boards around the world), developer Sucker Punch&#x27;s &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; of its acclaimed open-world stealth-action game Ghost of Tsushima is now official, and coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 20th August.
Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut, as the new edition is formally known, features all the content from the original release, alongside a new chapter in protagonist Jin&#x27;s story, which will see him travel to Tsushima&#x27;s neighbouring island of Iki.
&quot;In this new story,&quot; Sucker Punch explains on the PlayStation Blog, &quot;Jin travels to the island to investigate rumours of a Mongol presence. But soon, he finds himself caught up in events with deeply personal stakes that will force him to relive some traumatic moments from his past.&quot;

                    <span>It&#x27;s no secret that Team Fortress 2 has a bit of a bot problem, but the game also has a community that really enjoys mid-match shenanigans - and the two combined today in one of the funniest posts about TF2 bots I&#x27;ve seen so far. 
Reddit user 2Noel posted footage of an Attack/Defend match in which Blu team was pitted against a bunch of bots - normally not great news for those wanting to keep their heads on their shoulders. Yet the team decided to try a different tactic to just charging into battle, instead choosing to conga their way out of spawn and onto the control points. And surprisingly, it worked. Stay tuned for the satisfying bot slaughter at the end of the match:  
The question you&#x27;re probably asking right now is: why didn&#x27;t the bots shoot the Blu team members? The answer, it seems, is that the bots are programmed to avoid shooting players who are using taunts and emotes. If you look closely at the video, you&#x27;ll notice that players not engaged in the conga line (such as poor old atomdotdat) are instantly sniped by the bots, while the dancers remain unharmed.

                    <span>Norse god and Disney+ star Loki is now available in Fortnite, resplendent in his original Avengers movie outfit. Sign up to the game&#x27;s £10 Fortnite Crew subscription in June and you&#x27;ll get Loki for yourself, horns and all. 
But it is those horns which are causing a problem for some fans, who have said the mischievous god&#x27;s headpiece simply blocks too much of their view.
I&#x27;ve played a few games now as Loki and haven&#x27;t seen as much of an issue as the images being shared on reddit, such as the one below. I think this is probably angled to make the problem look as bad as possible, although yes, Loki&#x27;s enormous helmet is certainly quite distracting.

                    <span>Good news for anyone particularly attached to their Valheim buildings, as developer Iron Gate has tweaked the AI to make monsters slightly less keen on smashing up structures. 
Iron Gate recently made a change to enemy AI that made monsters much more aggressive towards buildings, and players started to complain the monsters had become a bit too rowdy. Enemies were seen running past players to destroy their buildings instead, while some monsters became so confused about what they should be attacking that they essentially froze in place. I checked the patch out for myself and discovered local greydwarfs had stripped our village walls of decorations, while a run-in with a troll ended in disaster when it became a bit too interested in my friend&#x27;s treehouse:
In any case, it seems Iron Gate noticed the AI change was causing a fair bit of chaos, and the AI has been tweaked once again to solve the problems.

                    <span>Sony has announced that Nixxes will join its growing family of PlayStation Studios.
The Netherlands-based Nixxes has a track record of working on the PC and console versions of multiplatform projects, and in recent years has worked with Square Enix on Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and the Tomb Raider franchise. 
PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst announced the acquisition this afternoon, just two days after the confirmation that Sony had also snapped up Returnal studio Housemarque. Exactly how much Nixxes cost is being kept confidential.

                    <span>Last week we heard that several fan-made GoldenEye levels in Far Cry 5 had been pulled by Ubisoft following a copyright claim, but it seems the author has now reuploaded the levels under a new name - which will hopefully be enough to ensure the levels stay up in future. 
After confirming the levels had been pulled, creator Krollywood said a few days ago he intended to &quot;change some details like names and re-upload them as soon as possible,&quot; and it seems that&#x27;s now happened. Krollywood confirmed in a Reddit comment that the levels have been reuploaded to Far Cry 5&#x27;s arcade mode under the name &quot;Golden Cry&quot;. To find them on PS4 you&#x27;ll need to search for the creator name &quot;Perfect-Dark1982&quot;, and on PC the creator name is &quot;Graslu00&quot;.
Krollywood spent two and a half years recreating the 18 GoldenEye 007 levels in Far Cry 5&#x27;s level editor, and you can hear a little about how he did it in the video below:

                    <span>Pokémon Go has today added a new twist to its in-game Special Research questlines: the ability for storylines to branch out and end in different ways. 
The feature will be used in Pokémon Go&#x27;s upcoming Go Fest 2021 event later in July, which is this year themed around music, to offer a choice of Pikachu costumes and build a pop or rock band comprised of different creatures. 
Today, however, the feature is being rolled out via Pokémon Go&#x27;s delightfully bizarre Bidoof celebration, which has flooded the game with the meme-heavy beaver over the past week.

                    <span>As with many online games, Apex Legends unfortunately has its fair share of cheaters, and developer Respawn is in something of a continuous battle to prevent them from misbehaving. In recent months players have reported increased DDoS attacks on Ranked games, with Respawn pledging to take &quot;huge steps&quot; to fix the problem. And we now have another update on what the studio is doing to combat cheaters, with Respawn hiring more people and developing new tools to keep them at bay. 
As explained on Twitter, Respawn said it&#x27;s hiring &quot;more people to focus on manual bans&quot;, and is also investigating new ways to catch and remove cheaters from games - presumably through automated tools. Respawn also specifically addressed the DDoS problem, saying it was &quot;developing more tools to automatically detect and stop DDoS attacks&quot;. 
&quot;Playing against cheaters sucks,&quot; said Respawn&#x27;s Twitter account. &quot;We&#x27;ll keep you updated as we ship the above changes and pursue new ones.&quot;

Asobo&#x27;s brilliant stealth horror game follows the story of two children on the run in medieval France, while creepy supernatural rat shenanigans ensue. 
This new version of the game, available for PS5 via Plus on 6th July, adds 4K visuals, 60FPS and faster loading. (It will also release for Xbox Series X as a free update on that date, as well as a new cloud-based version for Nintendo Switch).

                    <span>As ransomware becomes more common, I’m seeing more discussions about the ethics of paying the ransom. Here’s one more contribution to that issue: a research paper that the insurance industry is hurting more than it’s helping.
However, the most pressing challenge currently facing the industry is ransomware. Although it is a societal problem, cyber insurers have received considerable criticism for facilitating ransom payments to cybercriminals. These add fuel to the fire by incentivising cybercriminals’ engagement in ransomware operations and enabling existing operators to invest in and expand their capabilities. Growing losses from ransomware attacks have also emphasised that the current reality is not sustainable for insurers either...</span>

                    <span>PUBG&#x27;s much-teased Taego map has finally arrived on PC test servers, bringing with it some new features including self-revives and a special &quot;second chance&quot; mechanic. Well... new to PUBG, at least. 
The freshly-released patch notes explain that Taego is an 8x8 map set in 1980s South Korea, with landscapes &quot;ranging from wide-open reed fields to the close quarters of Hosan Prison&quot;. It&#x27;s also got some wildlife, with flocks of birds that react to player movement and gunfire, so take your binoculars with you - those birds might just help you track down another squad. If you stream yourself doing that, you&#x27;re a twitcher in two senses of the word. 
The map also has a new feature called Comeback BR, which gives players who die before the first Blue Zone the ability to get themselves back into the game. All you have to do is stay alive in a separate &quot;Comeback Arena&quot; for a certain amount of time. It sounds pretty similar to Call of Duty: Warzone&#x27;s Gulag, except it&#x27;s more like another mini battle royale rather than a one-on-one battle to the death. Players who survive are reintroduced to the main game in phase three of the match, complete with all their items and gear.

                    <span>Silent Hill publisher Konami has confirmed a partnership with Bloober Team, developer of horror games such as The Medium and Blair Witch.
The agreement allows Bloober to &quot;produce games from existing and new IPs&quot; which Konami owns - including, of course, the missing-in-action Silent Hill.
No further detail on the project was announced today, other than some vague promises of &quot;high quality content&quot; and the exchanging of game-making &quot;knowhow&quot;.

                    <span>Remember those Call of Duty: Modern Warfare maps that were surprise-added (and then removed) earlier this year? Well, they&#x27;re back once again, and hopefully they&#x27;re going to stick around a bit longer this time. 
The returning multiplayer maps are Al-Raab Airbase (6v6) and Drainage (Gunfight), with the former being reintroduced as a 24/7 playlist, and the latter now available in the Gunfight and Gunfight - Snipers Only playlists. 
The maps were originally added to the game in an update back in March, a move that surprised players given Activision was expected to have switched focus to supporting Black Ops Cold War and Warzone. Al-Raab Airbase and Drainage were briefly available to play in private matches, but in April Activision removed the two maps, later explaining they needed more time in the oven. Anyway, they have now returned, and should help mix things up for those still playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare multiplayer.

All purchases made in the game&#x27;s PC open beta will be refunded. Planned full launches for PlayStation, Steam and Xbox have been scrapped. 
Magic: Legends was first announced in January 2020, as the next project from Neverwinter and Star Trek Online developer Cryptic. It promised an action role-playing take on the Magic universe, more commonly seen in the ubiquitous card game.

                    <span>Control developer Remedy Entertainment has announced plans for two new titles in the series. 
The first will be a multiplayer spin-off, currently titled Project Condor. The next will be &quot;a bigger-budget Control game&quot; which sounds further off. 
Concept art for Condor shows a team of four players with a bagged-up enemy at their feet. Control franchise director Mikael Kasurinen said in a blog post that the image &quot;tells pretty well what Condor is about&quot;.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve ever felt bad about keeping all your old files in a mess, here&#x27;s something to make you feel better, as a much sought-after early version of Minecraft has finally been found - thanks to one player who made backups of her old laptop. Oh, and I guess this also means that tweeting everything is useful after all. 
As spotted by Kotaku, Twitter user @lunasorcery explained in a thread that she&#x27;d helped a group of Minecraft historians find a long-lost early version of the game. Build Alpha 1.1.1 was apparently a &quot;long-running meme&quot; and &quot;holy grail&quot; for Minecraft archivist group Omniarchive, as the historians had never been able to track the elusive build down. It was an exceedingly rare version of the game that was released on 18th September 2010, and was only available for three hours and 25 minutes due to a bug that would turn the player&#x27;s screen grey. 
Luckily, someone spotted a 2010 tweet by Luna in which she discussed the Minecraft update, and messaged her to ask if she had a copy of the build. She initially ignored the message, thinking there was &quot;no chance in hell&quot; that she would still have a copy, but last Friday another person contacted her about the tweet - and this prompted her to take a closer look.

                    <span>Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut is an unannounced new game spotted on a rating board website.
The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has a listing (thanks, ResetEra) for Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut, with Sony Interactive Entertainment mentioned as publisher, and PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 listed as platforms.
We don&#x27;t yet know what this Director&#x27;s Cut entails, but Sucker Punch&#x27;s adventure is reportedly set for a standalone expansion / DLC called Ghost of Ikishima. Perhaps that&#x27;s included.

Given the growth and scale of the Kubernetes project, the existing reporting mechanisms were proving to be inadequate and challenging.
Kubernetes is a large open source project. With over 100000 commits just to the main k/kubernetes repository, hundreds of other code
repositories in the project, and thousands of contributors, there&#x27;s a lot going on. In fact, there are 37 contributor groups at the time of
writing. We also value all forms of contribution and not just code changes.
With that context in mind, the challenge of reporting on all this activity was a call to action for exploring better options. Therefore
inspired by the Apache Software Foundation’s open guide to PMC Reporting and the
CNCF project Annual Reporting, the Kubernetes project is proud to ann…</span>

                    <span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will see its final DLC character released later this year, series director Masahiro Sakurai has confirmed.
In a video showing off DLC character Kazuya Mishima, out tomorrow, 29th June, Sakurai said the final character to be released as part of Fighters Pass Vol. 2 will be Ultimate&#x27;s last.
&quot;Up until now, we&#x27;ve created all sorts of fighters and stages,&quot; Sakurai said.

                    <span>Last week, Valheim developer Iron Gate rolled out a patch that was intended to provide players with an extra level of challenge: enemies were tweaked to be more aggressive towards structures, meaning players would have to be more proactive about defending their homes. But some players feel Iron Gate went overboard with these changes, highlighting that the patch has resulted in some strange enemy behaviour - along with the wanton destruction of property. 
Over on the Valheim subreddit, players have argued that Valheim&#x27;s monsters are now too eager to attack buildings, sometimes opting to destroy structures even when standing directly next to the player. This has led to some &quot;immersion-shattering&quot; enemy behaviour, with monsters looking uncertain about who they should be attacking. Some players, meanwhile, are simply exasperated at the amount of damage now being caused in monster raids. 
&quot;Earlier today I had a troll invasion and I had three trolls attacking my base non-stop,&quot; said Reddit user Squatch11. &quot;I literally couldn&#x27;t get them to attack me. Half of my base was destroyed before I managed to kill them.&quot;

                    <span>A Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City reverse-engineering fan project is back online after Take-Two issued a takedown earlier this year.
As Eurogamer reported in February, the GTA 3 and Vice City reverse-engineering fan projects known as re3 and reVC were hit by a DMCA filed by Rockstar parent company Take-Two that claimed copyright infringement.
The fan-created source code for both games was made available on GitHub, offering a raft of eye-catching improvements over the original games officially available to play today on PC. (For more, check out our feature on how re3 came to be.)

That&#x27;s according to franchise producer Masaru Oyamada, who was speaking during the Mana series&#x27; 30th anniversary live stream, below (thanks, Gematsu):
&quot;We wanted to announce it by running a cool trailer, but we&#x27;re only at the start of the 30th anniversary,&quot; Oyamada said.

                    <span>River, the real-life dog who inspired Dogmeat from Fallout 4, has passed away.
Joel Burgess, studio director at Capybara Games and former developer on Fallout 3, 4 and 76 at Bethesda, took to Twitter to look back at her impact on Fallout 4.
Dogmeat is a recurring dog non-player character in the Fallout series who acts as a possible companion to the player. Dogmeat is one of the most popular companions in the series, and was even a part of trailers made to promote Fallout 4.

Josep Rodriguez, a researcher and consultant at security firm IOActive, has spent the last year digging up and reporting vulnerabilities in the so-called near-field communications reader chips used in millions of ATMs and point-of-sale systems worldwide. NFC systems are what let you wave a credit card over a reader — rather than swipe or insert it — to make a payment or extract money from a cash machine.

                    <span>Good news, Guardian - Bungie is releasing more Moon and Dreaming City weapons with new perks, including the fan-favourite Twilight Oath.
&quot;Back in January we announced that four weapons from the Dreaming City and four weapons from the Moon were being reissued with new perk pools but had not brought them all back yet,&quot; the developer explained in its weekly update. &quot;In our next update, currently scheduled for [6th July], we will be reissuing the remaining Moon and Dreaming City weapons with new perks. 
&quot;All of these weapons will drop from their original sources on their respective destination.&quot;

As part of its &quot;one-year anniversary celebration&quot;, the Nintendo Switch-exclusive free-to-play &quot;Ninja-Gum&quot; action game is teaming up with the anime Demon Slater: Kimetsu no Yaiba for a limited-time event running from mid-July until the end of August.
Kicking off on 19th July, the collaboration will reportedly &quot;not only feature Tanjiro and Nezuko, but other members of the Demon Slayer Corps including Zenitsu and Rengoku, and their nemesis Muzan Kibutsuji himself&quot; (thanks, Nintendo Life).

                    <span>CD Projekt Red&#x27;s management has reportedly said the stability of its beleaguered RPG Cyberpunk 2077 has now reached a &quot;satisfactory level&quot;.
Addressing attendees at the WSE Innovation Day, CDPR CEO Adam Kiciński said the team was &quot;constantly working&quot; on patches to improve performance and stability, adding that further improvements were also being planned.
According to translation courtesy of Google Translate, Kiciński told TVN24: &quot;We have already achieved a satisfactory level in this regard [of stability]. We have also been working on the overall efficiency, which we are also quite happy about. Of course, we also removed bugs and glitches, and we will continue to do that.&quot;

                    <span>Blizzard has confirmed that while Overwatch 2 is definitely still slated to come to Nintendo Switch, the game will have &quot;some compromises&quot; on Nintendo&#x27;s handheld system.
In an AMA on Reddit, spotted by TheGamer, the team dutifully answered a bunch of questions about the sequel, including one from a fan self-described as a &quot;solely Switch player&quot; who asked how the improved graphics and performance seen in recent reveals will translate to Nintendo&#x27;s hardware.
The reply came from technical director, John Lafleur.

The seasoned director - who helped reboot the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series as lead designer on Origins and director on Valhalla - had been with the French developer/publisher for 16 years, but left earlier this year to join Motive on an unannounced project. 
Axios says &quot;neither EA nor Baptizat are commenting on the move&quot; (thanks, VGC), but we&#x27;ve reached out and will confirm as/when we hear back from either party.

                    <span>A rating for the unannounced Castlevania Advance Collection has popped up again - this time in Korea.
It solidifies a leak that came to light last week, when the same title similarly popped up in Australia.
This time, H2 Interactive Co. Ltd submitted the game to the panel - in Australia, it was publisher and IP holder Konami itself - which has been awarded an ages 12 and up rating (thanks, VG24/7).

It&#x27;s not the first time players have been able to double up as their favourite Avengers - it was first introduced via time-limited mode, The Tachyon Anomaly - but the feature proved so popular amongst the community that developer Crystal Dynamics is now introducing it permanently in a big update slated to come next month. 
&quot;Due to your feedback, we&#x27;re permanently turning on the ability to play multiple of the same Hero during matchmaking and when forming Strike Teams,&quot; the development team confirmed in a blog post, (thanks, TheGamer).

According to Steam&#x27;s official stats, the multiplayer FPS hit a peak of 151,253 concurrent players on Steam on Friday night.
The previous high was 147,360 concurrent players in December. At the time of this article&#x27;s publication, Team Fortress 2 had 141,741 concurrent players on Steam.

                    <span>Modders do incredible things with the video games we love. They build expansion-sized add-ons, issue performance fixes, and come up with the weird and wonderful to extend the life of games long since left behind by their original creators.
And then there&#x27;s this, a Greggs in Far Cry 5.
Edinburgh-based artist Mojo Swoptops recreated our nation&#x27;s sandwich shop in fine detail. It&#x27;s got a Greggs-looking counter flanked not by fridges stuffed with sparsely-filled sandwiches but shelving units packed with fruit. The Greggs sign is pretty close, though.

                    <span>Mass Effect Legendary Edition has certainly done the trick: it&#x27;s rekindled a love of BioWare&#x27;s original trilogy years after the games came out. But it&#x27;s not just Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 that are being judged once again. Fans are reappraising Mass Effect Andromeda, too.
2017&#x27;s Mass Effect Andromeda endured a torrid time upon release, with clips of dialogue scenes descending into meme status. There were other areas of the game that came under fire, including its limited character creator, bugs and animation quirks.
Beyond that, though, Andromeda&#x27;s missions, storyline and characters failed to set the world on fire. Without Commander Shepard, the Normandy and the original trilogy&#x27;s cast of much-loved characters, Andromeda set out for a new galaxy, a new premise and new party members. I think it&#x27;s fair to say it didn&#x27;t stick the landing. Some thought the game was just okay, others considered it outright awful. Either way, Andromeda flopped and BioWare soon moved on, leaving it sequel-less.

Variety reports lead showrunner Steven Kane will not return, should the show get picked up for a second season. Variety suggests a second season &quot;seems likely... given the high-profile nature of the underlying IP and the high level of investment on ViacomCBS&#x27; part&quot;.
Kane has been in Budapest, where production of the Halo TV show is ongoing, for the past two years and wants to return to the states for &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to Wes Keltner, CEO of Gun Media and one of the developers of Friday the 13th.
In a TwitLonger post, Keltner revealed a raft of content planned for the game before development was shut down in 2018 because of a messy Hollywood battle over ownership of the franchise.

                    <span>There was once a Mass Effect movie in the works. In 2010 EA sold off the film rights to Legendary Pictures, with then BioWare bosses Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk set to work as executive producers alongside former Mass Effect chief Casey Hudson. But it failed to materialise. Why?
In a recent interview with Business Insider, BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained what happened.
&quot;It felt like we were always fighting the IP,&quot; he said. &quot;What story are we going to tell in 90 to 120 minutes? Are we going to do it justice?&quot;

                    <span>Activision has defeated WWE wrestler Booker T in a Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 likeness lawsuit.
Booker T. Huffman claimed unlicensed use of his character &#x27;G.I. Bro&#x27; with the character &#x27;Prophet&#x27; from Treyarch&#x27;s Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in a lawsuit filed in February 2019.
The lawsuit revolved around a poster Booker T commissioned and used to promote his 2015 comic, G.I. Bro and the Dragon of Death. The comic stars a &quot;special operations hero called G.I. Bro&quot;. Prophet, from 2018&#x27;s Black Ops 4, is a &quot;cybernetically enhanced soldier&quot;. The image below compares the two characters:

Redditor Elpinko made this video after first creating a test version using just Family Guy characters. &quot;I can say that I have spent the last three days perfecting and tweaking but honestly I got carried away,&quot; he said. 
The video was made by putting together different clips from the famous TV shows, using exclusively cartoon characters, to create a battle royale match. Elpinko took action scenes out of the shows and paired them against each other with Apex maps as the setting.

                    <span>Good news everyone, Konami&#x27;s working on a brand new game - other than New Football Game Online Performance Test - and this one certainly looks intriguing. It&#x27;s a &quot;mystery simulation game&quot; called Crimesight, where players must deduce &quot;not only the culprit, but the victim as well&quot;. What, were you expecting Silent Hill? 
The social deduction game is set in a futuristic version of London where crimes can be predicted using an &quot;analytical programme developed using data harvested online&quot;. This has led to reduced crime rates across the world, but the system predicts a crime that could &quot;plunge the world into chaos&quot;, prompting the system&#x27;s architects to create an AI called Sherlock to investigate and prevent this crime.
Sherlock must prevent the criminal mastermind AI (named Moriarty, of course) from committing simulated murder, while Moriarty will try to predict the perfect moment to murder an NPC avatar. The trailer explains that Crimesight allows for 2-4 person multiplayer, and that the game takes place on what looks like a virtual tabletop board.

                    <span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a next-gen exclusive game - it&#x27;s due out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and Stadia at some point in 2022 (assuming it doesn&#x27;t get delayed). But what does being next-gen exclusive actually mean?
In the video below, developer Massive Entertainment discusses how the team has improved its Snowdrop game engine - the one it used to build The Division - to make use of the more powerful hardware.
There&#x27;s a lot of talk about ray tracing and object detail, which is great. And Avatar does look like quite the tech powerhouse - a game that will actually push those next-gen consoles. But my ears were pricked by something Alice Rendell, lead narrative realisation designer, mentioned too: Massive has created a system where NPCs understand the state of the world. For example, they&#x27;re aware of the weather, player progression and time of day. That sounds pretty cool, and I&#x27;m already imagining NPCs complaining about the rain. It rains on Pandora, right?

                    <span>Microsoft unveiled Windows 11 last night, and in doing so mentioned new gaming-focused features.
Windows 11 automatically adds high dynamic range (HDR) enhancements to games built on DirectX 11 or higher that previously only used standard dynamic range (SDR). HDR allows a supported game to render a much wider range of brightness values and colours. It&#x27;s a tech already in the Xbox Series X and S. Microsoft mentioned over 1000 games will support auto HDR, including Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, Rocket League, DayZ, and even Doom 64.
Microsoft said Windows 11 will load new games faster via tech called DirectStorage. Again, this was a part of Xbox Series X and S tech. DirectStorage means games quickly load assets to the graphics card without bogging down the CPU. Microsoft  said to expect incredibly detailed game worlds rendered at &quot;lightning speeds&quot; and without long load times. &quot;DirectStorage Optimised&quot; Windows 11 PCs are configured with the hardware and drivers needed to enable this.

The video showcases GTA 5 running in 8k on an Nvidia RTX 3090. Various mods have been applied, such as QuantV, which updates the games graphics and GTA 5 Real Life Pack.

                    <span>Insomniac Games has largely focused on single-player titles over the last few years, producing big hits Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man for the PlayStation. But it seems the studio has plans to work on a multiplayer project - although exactly what this could be is anyone&#x27;s guess. 
A job advert posted by Insomniac on Twitter mentions the developer has &quot;five new job openings for a multiplayer project&quot;. Insomniac is looking for a creative director, systems designer, story lead, art director and VFX artist. 
That doesn&#x27;t give much away, but the systems designer job description does mention having a &quot;thorough understanding of melee combat systems, enemy design and boss design&quot; would be useful experience. The designer would help develop &quot;combat, navigation, progression, and economy&quot; for a multiplayer environment. Make of that what you will.

                    <span>343 has gone into detail on Halo Infinite&#x27;s seasons, insisting they should be manageable from a player perspective.
In a post on Halo Waypoint, live team design director Ryan Paradis and lead progression designer Christopher Blohm discussed 343&#x27;s seasons and battle pass philosophy.
Infinite&#x27;s seasons will each last three months, which, according to Paradis, &quot;gives players a good amount of time to experience and explore the seasonal content, without it getting tiresome and without constantly pulling the rug from under players.&quot;

                    <span>Ubisoft has pulled GoldenEye levels a fan made in Far Cry 5 after a copyright infringement complaint.
YouTuber Krollywood spent two-and-a-half years recreating Rare&#x27;s seminal N64 first-person shooter inside the level editor provided within Far Cry 5, but this week Ubisoft removed the levels from the game&#x27;s arcade mode after a copyright infringement claim reportedly issued by MGM.
All 18 GoldenEye campaign levels were remade and made available to play by anyone in Far Cry 5&#x27;s arcade mode, even with the odd additional Easter egg. You can check out the Dam remake level in the video below:

According to the Global Times report, the system had shot down several PLA pilots during a handful of virtual exercises in recent years. Observers outside China noted that while reports coming out of state-controlled media outlets should be taken with a grain of salt, the capabilities described in the report are not outside the realm of possibility...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s very much a case of &#x27;gotta go faster&#x27; this week on the Epic Games Store, where Sega&#x27;s masterful retro platformer reimagining Sonic Mania and the excellent old-school arcade racer Horizon Chase Turbo are both currently free.
2017&#x27;s Sonic Mania, if it somehow managed to pass you by, sees developer Christian Whitehead and team serving up a sumptuous smorgasbord of classic side-scrolling platforming, meticulously designed to evoke the breathless left-right thrills of Sonic&#x27;s 16-bit heyday. 
Brand-new stages sit alongside beloved classics taken from Sonic 1 through Sonic &amp; Knuckles - all thoroughly, expertly remixed to form playful new challenges - and the package is topped off with vibrant visuals and a flawless soundtrack, both managing to perfectly capture the spirit of Sonic&#x27;s original Mega Drive adventures.

Oh, and everyone&#x27;s favourite murder site, Skull Town, is being introduced as an Arenas map. 
The Genesis Collection Event kicks off on 29th June and lasts until 13th July, offering a bunch of new paid cosmetics (and what looks like an extremely cool Revenant scythe heirloom). As usual, you can acquire these by purchasing event packs or buying them directly with Apex Coins or Crafting Materials. You&#x27;ll need to purchase all 24 items to unlock the Revenant heirloom - paying for all of that would certainly be the death of me. 
There are some freebies, however: players will be able to earn 1600 points per day in daily challenges as part of the event&#x27;s rewards track. This includes legendary Charge Rifle and EVA-8 skins, along with a variety of charms. On top of this, there are some stretch challenges with special event badges as rewards.

                    <span>Cowering in terror used to be one of my absolute favourite strategies during my early Valheim days, but from now on it seems that will be a less viable tactic. Developer Iron Gate is introducing some enemy AI tweaks to make monsters more aggressive, which should encourage them to start barging into your base. How rude.
The latest Valheim patch notes explain that the new update will fix several AI issues, with monsters made &quot;slightly more aggressive&quot;. They will now &quot;attack your buildings etc. when they are not able to attack you&quot;, meaning you&#x27;ll probably have to be more proactive in taking out enemies before they destroy your beautiful wooden structures. &quot;It&#x27;s fun for the whole family,&quot; Iron Gate said in the patch notes. (Is it, though?)
If you&#x27;re strolling through the Black Forest, you may also want to watch your head, as the Greydwarfs have had their aim improved - meaning they now have half a chance of actually getting a shot on target. A &quot;long forgotten Blob event&quot; has also been enabled, while bosses will no longer run from you. All in all, it sounds like the world of Valheim is getting a little more dangerous.

                    <span>It&#x27;s time for the latest chapter in Valve&#x27;s ongoing battle with Team Fortress 2 bots: this week sees a new update that should, in theory, make bot behaviour slightly less annoying.
As detailed on the Team Fortress 2 updates page, TF2 was patched on Tuesday with a number of measures that should limit what bots get up to when in-game. There&#x27;s now a tool to control how many times players can change their name in a match, for instance, and for public matchmaking it seems this has been set to zero - thus preventing bots from frequently changing their names or mimicking real players. 
The update also introduces a grace period at the start of matches to prevent players immediately calling votes, which should put the brakes on bots that are trying to deliberately clog up the vote-kick system. Similarly, players joining an in-progress game will face a cooldown before they can call a vote. Kick votes will also &quot;end early and automatically pass if the vote target leaves the match during the vote&quot;.

According to The Verge, Microsoft will open up its store to any Windows app, which means apps such as Chrome will be available for the first time.

                    <span>Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy - leaving some players unable to access significant portions of the game&#x27;s single-player content and its DLC. And despite these issues, the game and its DLC are still on sale.
The server shutdown began on 1st June, after which players began to report problems accessing DLC areas from the game&#x27;s The Falcon &amp; The Unicorn expansion. Players who owned the DLC also found they were unable to play past Act 1 of the main game with the expansion installed. Some who bought the deluxe version reported they could no longer access the special in-game items included with that version (via PC Gamer). 
Players have been creating their own workarounds for the problems, with some editing NPC dialogue to do so, but so far there hasn&#x27;t been an official fix. Ubisoft told Eurogamer it is &quot;aware and investigating the reported issues with our internal teams&quot;.

In the video, below, the Skywind team show off the work done so far, and announce a few major milestones, such as the completion of almost all the concept art.

                    <span>The Norwegian Consumer Council just published a fantastic new report: “Time to Ban Surveillance-Based Advertising.” From the Introduction:
The challenges caused and entrenched by surveillance-based advertising include, but are not limited to:
privacy and data protection infringements
opaque business models
manipulation and discrimination at scale
fraud and other criminal activity
serious security risks
In the following chapters, we describe various aspects of these challenges and point out how today’s dominant model of online advertising is a threat to consumers, democratic societies, the media, and even to advertisers themselves. These issues are significant and serious enough that we believe that it is time to ban these detrimental practices...</span>

                    <span>Space Jam - the cult Looney-Tunes-meets-live-action basketball movie from the 90s - is getting the retro-style video game beat-&#x27;em-up treatment for Xbox, PC, and mobile to promote upcoming movie sequel, Space Jam: A New Legacy, and it&#x27;ll be accompanied by a range of new Space-Jam-themed Xbox controllers.
According to a new post on Xbox Wire, Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game, developed by Digital Eclipse, was inspired by a number of fan-submitted idea picked as part of a competition held late last year. That ultimately led to the creation of a 90s-inspired arcade beat-&#x27;em-up in which Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, and LeBron James engage in some basketball-imbued brawling to defeat a virtual army controlled by a nefarious AI.
&quot;Fortunately,&quot; explains Microsoft, &quot;our heroes have access to a variety of moves, including a special basketball, and some rather unique Space Jam cards, to help them out.&quot;

                    <span>The original Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive first launched in Japan on 23rd June 1991 - 30 years ago today.
Sonic himself is actually a couple of years older. Like the Nintendo mascot he was engineered to replicate, Sonic first popped up elsewhere - in 1991 Sega arcade racer Rad Mobile - before getting his own game.
But it&#x27;s that 1991 side-scrolling classic which defined Sonic&#x27;s appeal, as well as the series&#x27; gameplay, design and villain Doctor &quot;Eggman&quot; Robotnik.

Using GameGAN, Kinsley collaborated with developer Daniel Kukieła on this two-month project, which followed a similar idea last year that recreated Pac-Man by watching another AI play through the game.
Neither of the two collaborators came in with much knowledge of GANs, Kinsley told Eurogamer. &quot;It was a lot of trial and error and just small tweaks and seeing if and how they improved. We didn&#x27;t have much knowledge, so we had a lot of learning to do, and still do.&quot;

Newly-filed court documents show The Pokémon Company has now reached a $300k settlement with the pair, who are described as having stolen &quot;trade secrets&quot; by snapping &quot;illicit pictures from an unreleased strategy guide&quot; (thanks, Polygon). 
One of the defendants was discovered to have been employed at LSC Communications, the company which had printed the Pokémon Sword and Shield strategy guide. The other defendant was identified as the individual who had then received photos of the guide via a group chat and posted them onto Discord, making them public.

Last year&#x27;s say-on-pay vote saw 170.89m votes against the company&#x27;s plan versus just 59.6m votes for.

                    <span>The issue is currently affecting Marvel&#x27;s Avengers on PlayStation 5, and has left streamers saying they cannot play until it is sorted out.

                    <span>Chinese conglomerate Tencent now holds a majority stake in Yager, the Berlin-based developer behind cult favourite 2012 shooter Spec Ops: The Line.
Tencent first acquired a small stake in the company back in February 2020. At the time, Yager said it would put the funds towards its free-to-play multiplayer game The Cycle, and then unnamed future projects.
Today&#x27;s news was revealed in an interview with Yager boss Timo Ullmann by German site gameswirtschaft.de, and picked up by Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad. In it, Ullmann says the move comes ahead of a relaunch for The Cycle based on early access feedback.

                    <span>In a video message posted this morning, director Hasan Kahraman faced the camera to pass on a message Blue Box has now stated repeatedly: it is not involved with Kojima, and it is not working on a new Silent Hill game. 
If this sounds familiar, that&#x27;s because Blue Box said as much back in April. And again last week on Twitter. And now again today.

                    <span>It looks like Call of Duty: Warzone&#x27;s controversial Roze skin is finally, properly nerfed.
Developer Raven made a change to the skin for the start of Season 4, and it has brightened up what was a very dark outfit for operator Roze.
Activision&#x27;s battle royale has for months come under fire for a particular skin for Roze, which many considered &quot;pay-to-win&quot;.

                    <span>Since the start of its new season, Fortnite&#x27;s island has lain in the shadow of a giant UFO mothership. Today, you can beam aboard and explore.
Get beamed up and you&#x27;ll find yourself in a mini dungeon filled with locations from the past to hop around in low-gravity. (I am delighted to see the return of the much-missed Butter Barn, home of Fortnite&#x27;s brilliant pancake song.)
With 90 seconds on the clock, the aim of the game is to collect alien orbs which boost the amount of loot you&#x27;ll get upon leaving. You can also extend your time in the mothership by picking up timer orbs.

                    <span>A Final Fantasy 9 animated kids series is in the works.
Kidscreen reports Paris-based Cyber Group Studios has done a deal with Square Enix to adapt the 21-year-old role-playing game into an animated series aimed at eight to 13-year-olds.
It&#x27;s early days, though. Cyber Group Studios plans to pitch the project to broadcasters in the coming months, with production set to begin by the end of 2021 or beginning of 2022. Episode count and length have yet to be decided.

                    <span>After more than a year of gameplay bonuses designed to make Pokémon Go easier to play during the pandemic, developer Niantic has laid out a detailed roadmap for how it will remove, replace and adopt these changes in the future.
Some changes will be made permanent, though others - most notably the ability to interact with PokéStops and gyms at an increased distance - will be removed. 
But changes will be made on a country-by-country basis, Niantic has said, and in the short term there will be new temporary &quot;exploration bonuses&quot; for countries which lose the pandemic changes soon.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve boss Bobby Kotick&#x27;s $155m pay packet after a controversial delay.
GamesIndustry.biz reports the say-on-pay vote, which had been delayed to this week in what was seen by some as an effort by Activision Blizzard to avoid an embarrassing slapdown, won approval from 54 percent of shareholders - down from the 56.8 percent approval seen last year, which itself was down from the 58 percent approval of 2019.
The decision comes following significant pressure from CtW, an investment company that &quot;holds directors accountable for irresponsible and unethical corporate behaviour and excessive executive pay&quot;.

                    <span>At this year’s Apple Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple announced something called “iCloud Private Relay.” That’s basically its private version of onion routing, which is what Tor does.
Privacy Relay is built into both the forthcoming iOS and MacOS versions, but it will only work if you’re an iCloud Plus subscriber and you have it enabled from within your iCloud settings.
Once it’s enabled and you open Safari to browse, Private Relay splits up two pieces of information that — when delivered to websites together as normal — could quickly identify you. Those are your IP address (who and exactly where you are) and your DNS request (the address of the website you want, in numeric form)...</span>

Operators are proving to be an excellent solution to
running stateful distributed applications in Kubernetes. Open source tools like
the Operator SDK provide ways to build reliable and maintainable
operators, making it easier to extend Kubernetes and implement custom
scheduling.
Kubernetes operators run complex software inside your cluster. The open source
community has already built many operators for distributed
applications like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, or Argo CD. Even outside of
open source, operators can help to bring new functionality to your Kubernetes
cluster.
An operator is a set of custom resources and a
set of controllers. A controller watches for changes to specific
resources in the Kubernetes API and reacts by creating, updating, or deleting

                    <span>Kim Swift, lead designer on Portal, has joined Xbox Game Studios to work on its publishing programme. 
Xbox announced the hire today via a Twitter post which mentioned Swift&#x27;s role would be to &quot;accelerate our innovation and collaborate with independent studios to build games for the cloud&quot;. 
Swift is most famous for her stint at Valve, which began when her portal-based game demo Narbacular Drop impressed Valve bosses and she was roped on board.

                    <span>Nefarious fans selling codes for an upcoming Destiny 2 player emblem have been called out by Bungie.
The in-game emblem, themed after the beloved Spicy Ramen Coupon item, was planned as a surprise free gift in July, Bungie community manager dmg04 was forced to reveal.
The emblem was discovered by dataminers peering within Destiny 2&#x27;s API. Some fans then began to charge for early access to it.

                    <span>Tekken X Street Fighter was &quot;about 30 percent done&quot; when it was cancelled.
Speaking on his YouTube series Harada&#x27;s Bar, Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada discussed the ill-fated project, which was announced 11 years ago in July 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Tekken X Street Fighter was a much-hyped crossover fighting game in development at Bandai Namco in collaboration with Street Fighter maker Capcom. It was meant to follow 2D fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken by mashing together characters from both series, this time in the 3D Tekken style.

Redditor Rxelik discovered a plain-looking door found in a warehouse in Salt Mines instantly downs with just a touch, and uploaded the footage to r/warzone.
It&#x27;s not an issue isolated to Rxelik, either. This door has downed a few players since Season 4 went live last week.

                    <span>After being interrupted during mining in the Black Forest for the thousandth time, you could be forgiven for wanting to beat up a Greydwarf with your bare hands - and thanks to the work of Valheim&#x27;s modding community, you now can. Well, while holding VR controllers, I guess. 
VHVR is a community-made VR mod for Valheim that was first released back in April, and did a pretty good job of translating Valehim&#x27;s Viking world into VR (even if players could only move using a standard gamepad or mouse and keyboard). Here&#x27;s our own Ian Higton trying it out at the time:
Work on the mod continued post-launch, and now VHVR has been given a game-changing update that adds motion control support. Thanks to the work of modder Maddy25 (who apparently almost single-handedly implemented many of the motion control systems), you can now interact with items in Valheim more directly. There&#x27;s upper-body and finger tracking using VRIK, melee combat, bow and arrow controls, fishing, point and click building, and you can use your hands to interact with the environment. There are also custom VR controls for interacting with menus, along with switching and equipping items.

                    <span>Pokémon Go will introduce a new costumed Pikachu variant only available in the Okinawa islands of Japan.
It&#x27;s the first time the game has reserved a costumed Pokémon specifically for a certain region - and a small one, at that. 
Immediately, the announcement raised eyebrows among fans wanting to catch &#x27;em all - but unable to do so due to ongoing international travel restrictions.

That&#x27;s according to a comment made by GamesBeat&#x27;s ever-chatty Jeff Grubb, which was picked up by VGC, and which tallies with information we&#x27;ve also heard.
According to Grubb, EA plans to announce the project at its upcoming EA Play event in just a few weeks&#x27; time. So, act surprised.

                    <span>The Center for Security and Emerging Technology has a new report: “Machine Learning and Cybersecurity: Hype and Reality.” Here’s the bottom line:
The report offers four conclusions:
Machine learning can help defenders more accurately detect and triage potential attacks. However, in many cases these technologies are elaborations on long-standing methods — not fundamentally new approaches — that bring new attack surfaces of their own.
A wide range of specific tasks could be fully or partially automated with the use of machine learning, including some forms of vulnerability discovery, deception, and attack disruption. But many of the most transformative of these possibilities still require significant machine learning breakthroughs.

                    <span>Square Enix says it is &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; by the success of its new IP, Outriders, stating &quot;the digital sales ratio for the title have been very high&quot; and insisting that its &quot;decision to make Outriders available with Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass as soon as the title launched also worked in [its] favour&quot;.
Xbox teased the shooter was coming to Xbox Game Pass just a couple of weeks before release, and swiftly became one of the service&#x27;s most high-profile Game Pass offerings. Now, a few months on, Square Enix says that despite the &quot;slight issues&quot; with bugs and server instability, it has &quot;gotten off to a good start as a new IP&quot;.
&quot;In regards to the response to Outriders, while there were slight issues with bugs and the like on launch, we believe it has gotten off to a good start as a new IP,&quot; Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda told investors at a financial briefing back in May, the English translation of which was published today (thanks, VGC).

                    <span>Following the release of a new video teaser showcasing what&#x27;s new in the upcoming TAEGO update for PUBG, fans think they&#x27;ve discovered new features coming the original battle royale game, including new weapons, vehicles, a new zone feature, and even self pick-up.
According to an analysis by dataminer PlayerIGN (thanks, PCGN), as well as self-pickup, TAEGO&#x27;s new 8x8 map will also feature a new Pony Coupe vehicle, 5.56 K2 Assault Rifle, 5.56 K12 DMR, a &quot;new airdrop type&quot;, a possible new Zone feature, and the return of Paramo&#x27;s Chinook helicopter.
A second teaser and screenshots released in Korea also suggest we&#x27;ll see a palace and a school on the new map, with rumours the new content will be available to play on the PC Test Server from 30th June.

In an interview with GameSpot, Bihlfroff said they could &quot;definitely confirm [Bayonetta 3] still exists&quot;.
&quot;I will even go one further and say that not only does it exist, but it&#x27;s progressing well,&quot; Trinen clarified.

According to a tweet posted by a senior producer from Double Fine over the weekend, the &quot;amazing&quot; team has created &quot;something so special&quot; and has managed to do so without crunch, the industry term given to intense and often mandatory overtime that many studios require in order to get games completed in time to meet their release dates.
&quot;Fun fact: Psychonauts 2 has had no crunch,&quot; announced Double Fine&#x27;s Kevin Johnson on Twitter (thanks, TheGamer).

Polfeldt, who was heading the Ubisoft team responsible for the upcoming Avatar game as well as leading on titles like The Division, is taking &quot;a long break&quot; before &quot;embark[ing] on a new adventure in Ubisoft&quot;. Polfeldt has worked at Massive for 17 years, and served as managing director for 12 of those.
&quot;When we signed Star Wars, and finally completed our beautiful building Eden in 2020, I felt an overwhelming sense of completion, as if I had achieved everything I once dreamt of,&quot; the director said on the Ubisoft blog (thanks, VGC).

                    <span>The team behind Among Us, Innersloth, has opened up about feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; and &quot;burnt out&quot; after the success of their cult classic multiplayer detective game during lockdown.
&quot;Among Us going viral, it was just like, &#x27;OK, this is my life,&#x27;&quot; said artist Amy Liu. &quot;The pressure to get things done quickly was really high. September to December, we&#x27;re talking to Xbox, PlayStation. They were gonna try to get Among Us on these platforms, which usually takes many months - like, half a year to a year. We were like, &#x27;Three months! We&#x27;re gonna try that.&#x27;&quot;
&quot;I definitely burnt out,&quot; Liu told Anthony Padilla (thanks, Kotaku). &quot;It was tough because during all of this, we weren&#x27;t able to see friends and family. Being so tired from working, I couldn&#x27;t even go visit my family during covid and had to spend holidays alone... that was definitely the hardest time.&quot;

In a post on EA&#x27;s website, community manager &#x27;Straatford&#x27; said the company had noticed queue times in the US West region for the 2013 DICE-developed shooter were far longer than in other regions. In response, EA increased server capacity in this region, so players should expect less waiting to get into a game.
&quot;We were absolutely blown away by your excitement and reactions to the recent Battlefield 2042 reveal,&quot; Straatford said.

The MG 82, added to the game as a tier 15 unlock from the Season 4 battle pass on Thursday, was soon found to shred enemies extremely quickly - at a time when developer Raven wants to increase Warzone&#x27;s &#x27;time-to-kill&#x27;.
One of the other issues with the gun is it is available out in the field as ground loot. This means players have early access to an extremely strong gun, simply from looting. Sometimes you&#x27;ll pick up the MG 82 with decent attachments, too.

                    <span>Pottering around a Viking-era version of your home in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is an enormous amount of fun - as I discovered from my adventures in Gloucestershire - but could it also encourage others to visit your country? That&#x27;s what Tourism Ireland is banking on, as the organisation has teamed up with Ubisoft to use Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla in a promotional campaign. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s first expansion, Wrath of the Druids, brings Viking protagonist Eivor across the seas to embark on new adventures in Ireland. Locations such as Dublin, Benbulben, the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and the Hill of Tara are all visitable in-game, and Tourism Ireland has collaborated with Ubisoft to create a comparison video showing the game versions and their real-life counterparts: 
The campaign doesn&#x27;t end there, however, as streamers in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Scandinavia will help showcase Irish landscapes in Wrath of the Druids as part of the collaboration. This is the first time that Tourism Ireland has worked with gaming content creators.

                    <span>Under increasing pressure from governments, children&#x27;s welfare groups and gambling charities, EA has today added the ability to see what&#x27;s inside FIFA 21 loot boxes before you buy them.
These Ultimate Team Preview Packs, as EA calls them, let you see all the specific items contained within them before you make a decision on whether to buy with FUT Coins or FIFA Points.
FUT Coins is a virtual currency earned through gameplay. FIFA Points is a virtual currency bought with real-world money.

Three years on from that mode&#x27;s appearance, however, you&#x27;ll soon be able to obtain Thanos for keeps.

Redditor AsleepEntrepreneur73 spotted updates for both games on the EpicData website, an Epic Games Store data tracker.
It looks like both games&#x27; entry on the database is via codenames (HeronStaging for Alan Wake Remastered, and Pineapple for Final Fantasy 7 Remake), but you can see the real game names in the cloud save folder.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s big Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla update added a new mode to the game, Mastery Challenge, which offers a series of repeatable maps to stomp and stealth your way through in return for fresh rewards. 
We knew the gist of all this already - and we&#x27;ll go into more detail below - but what has come as a nice surprise is the new narrative this mode folds into the game, including a tease for something else being added to Valhalla down the line. 
The Mastery Challenge questline begins with a bang, as a meteor hits Eivor&#x27;s Ravensthorpe. The impact reveals a door, apparently concealed within the cliffside all this time, and a mysterious woman, Hildiran, who&#x27;s now investigating what&#x27;s going on.

                    <span>What if you were a tiny little semi-sentient program running through a mainframe? Well, that&#x27;s basically what&#x27;s going on in Recompile - a Metroidvania-inspired 3D platformer that&#x27;s due to release later this year. 
Recompile was originally planned for release in 2020, but as announced during Gamespot&#x27;s Play for All showcase, it&#x27;s now set to launch this August. Players take on the role of a computer virus that&#x27;s trying to escape deletion. It&#x27;s got snappy combat, generous amounts of mobility and plenty of hacking-themed puzzles - as I discovered when I tried it out at EGX Rezzed in 2019. 
Oh, also there are some pretty spectacular visual effects going on, as you can see from the latest trailer:

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone on PlayStation 4 received a surprise update this week to enable 120fps on PlayStation 5 via backwards compatibility, but it can be tricky to actually make work.
Fans soon discovered that in order to get 120fps on the battle royale, you have to turn off HDR (high-dynamic-range imaging) on the PS5.
I had a chat with Rich from Digital Foundry and he verified this is the case. Disabling HDR is the only way to get Warzone working at 120fps on PS5.

                    <span>Elden Ring finally stepped out of the shadows with a proper trailer and several chunky interviews during E3 week, but one person we hadn&#x27;t heard from on the subject was, of course, George R.R. Martin. The Game of Thrones author has been involved in some of the writing for Elden Ring, and now we&#x27;ve finally heard a little more about his contributions from the man himself. 
Martin recently visited Northwestern University&#x27;s Medill School of Journalism (where he studied in the &#x27;70s) to receive an honorary doctorate, and during the visit spoke to local news station WWTW about his career... including Elden Ring. He didn&#x27;t exactly provide any shocking revelations, but confirmed he&#x27;d mainly been involved in the early stages of development and creating the game&#x27;s fantasy world. 
&quot;The game is called the Elden Ring and it&#x27;s a sequel to a video game that came out a few years ago called Dark Souls,&quot; Martin said. &quot;My work on it was actually done years ago. These games, they&#x27;re like movies, they take a long time to develop.

Nintendo customer support is aware of the problem, and there is a page of troubleshooting tips to follow if you encounter the issue&#x27;s error code: 2123-1502.
Fans I&#x27;ve spoken to say customer support is helping as best it can, but that repeating the above &quot;possible solutions&quot; per-download is meant as a temporary solution at present.

The update, which brings with it the next chapter in the Shadowlands story, adds a new zone called Korthia. This area, which the Jailer has pulled into the Maw, includes a number of new quests.
There&#x27;s a new mega-dungeon called Tazavesh, The Veiled Market. &quot;Explore the exotic wares, merchants, and creatures of this Broker bazaar, which culminates in a high-stakes heist involving powerful artifacts from Azeroth,&quot; Blizzard said.

Bowser&#x27;s Airship is one of the largest Super Mario sets we&#x27;ve seen so far. Clocking in at over 14 inches, this 1152-piece addition provides one of the best-looking builds of the entire range.
There&#x27;s no official launch date yet, and Amazon&#x27;s product listing page has now been deleted. Still, we&#x27;d expect it to arrive in August alongside the upcoming Super Luigi Starter Kit and the third wave of blind bag add-ons announced officially earlier this week.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 4 launched yesterday, and with it brought a new vehicle - and the return of an old exploit.
Season 4 added a new armored cargo truck to the game - itself a controversial addition due to how strong the vehicle is, particularly in solo battle royale. But it got a lot worse when it soon emerged the truck could be used to turn invisible.

Once the World Update is downloaded (first update the sim, then grab the World Update from the in-game Marketplace) players will also have the opportunity to tackle five new bush trips - one for each of the new Nordic countries - plus five new landing challenges, focussed on Denmark&#x27;s Bornholm, Iceland&#x27;s Ísafjörður, Sweden&#x27;s Stockholm Arlanda, Norway&#x27;s Svalbard, and Finland&#x27;s Vaasa Airports.

                    <span>Xbox Design Lab was temporarily suspended last October while Microsoft worked on transitioning between console generations, but the custom controller service is back - allowing you to design your own Series X/S controller. 
The relaunch was announced during Xbox&#x27;s E3 follow-up showcase this evening, and the Xbox Design Lab website is now up and running. The customisation program allows you to pick colours for most external parts of the controller, including the &quot;body, back case, D-pad, bumpers, triggers, thumbsticks, ABXY, View, Menu and Share buttons.&quot; The Xbox Wire blog post says there are 18 colours to choose from, including the colours of existing Xbox Series X/S controllers like Shock Blue and Pulse Red.   
If you want to make it extra personal, you can also get your controller engraved with a Gamertag or custom message of up to 16 characters.

                    <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; next major free update is packing in one hell of a crossover, bringing the world of Disney&#x27;s Pirates of the Caribbean into Rare&#x27;s swashbuckling multiplayer adventure. And if the arrival of Captain Jack Sparrow wasn&#x27;t enough to be excited about, it&#x27;s also finally giving the formidable kraken a face - which makes an appearance in a brand-new trailer.
The centrepiece of Sea of Thieves&#x27; Pirates of the Caribbean crossover - officially known as A Pirate&#x27;s Life - takes the form of a brand-new cinematic story campaign. It features five new Tall Tales episodes (the first since March 2020&#x27;s Heart of Flame), charting Jack Sparrow&#x27;s arrival in the Sea of Thieves and the events that ensue.
There are tantalising snatches of those adventures in Rare&#x27;s second crossover trailer below, including the appearance of Davy Jones and his formidable vessel the Flying Dutchman, battles against gargantuan mermaid statues, and even a portable talking skull that should stir fond memories for Monkey Island aficionados.

Asobo&#x27;s medieval horror is getting a makeover for Xbox Series X on 6th July, with 4K resolution, 60 FPS and other visual enhancements. 
As ever, if you play on Xbox Series X you&#x27;ll just get these enhancements on that date with no extra fuss. Microsoft announced the update tonight, during its E3 Xbox Showcase: Extended event.

                    <span>Ninja Theory has released a new video for Xbox exclusive Hellblade 2, and provided an update on its development.
The video, below, does not include any gameplay or any new footage of the game save some hard to make out snippets. It begins instead with a message from Ninja Theory chief Tameem Antoniades, who discusses the work that&#x27;s being done to make Hellblade 2 at the Microsoft-owned studio&#x27;s new digs in Cambridge. The video then goes on to present a rather disturbing montage that sets the scene.
I get the impression Hellblade 2 is still a long way off. In the video, Antoniades says Ninja Theory is currently building &quot;a good chunky slice of the game before we then move into full production to build out the rest&quot;.

                    <span>If you were wondering just how popular PUBG is on mobile, the answer is: very, as 17 million people have now signed up for upcoming mobile title PUBG: New State. 
PUBG: New State was announced back in February and described as the &quot;only mobile successor to the original PC version of PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;. It&#x27;s a futuristic version of PUBG set after the events of the original game, in the year 2051. It&#x27;s supposed to have &quot;ultra-realistic graphics&quot; that will surpass &quot;what was previously possible in mobile gaming graphics&quot;, along with some new game mechanics like dodging, drone calls and support requests. 
Pre-registration was opened up following the game&#x27;s announcement, with players able to register their interest via Google Play and the App Store. And it seems to have received a lot of attention, judging by the numbers announced by PUBG Corp today.

                    <span>Well, another Cyberpunk 2077 patch has arrived, and although this one doesn&#x27;t bring any spectacular gameplay additions it does promise further bug fixes and stability improvements.
Patch 1.23 is now live on all platforms, and sorts out a number of quest-specific bugs and general performance issues. The patch itself is apparently rather chunky, with console users reporting a download size of 30GB (my Steam download was a rather more modest 3.45GB).  
Of note is the paragraph on stability and performance, which says the patch will provide &quot;numerous crash fixes in animations, UI, scene, physics and gameplay systems&quot;. The patch also promises a reduction in the number of crashes through &quot;memory optimisations and memory management improvements in various systems&quot;. There&#x27;s also a vague mention of &quot;various console CPU optimisations&quot;.

                    <span>It sounds like a dystopian nightmare, yet it&#x27;s fast becoming a reality: Facebook has announced it&#x27;s going to start testing in-headset VR adverts. 
Facebook initially started testing adverts on the Oculus mobile app last month, but it&#x27;s now taking things a step further by trialling adverts inside the Oculus Quest VR headset. The adverts are first being tested in a game called Blaston by Resolution Games, and will roll out to a couple of other apps &quot;over the coming weeks&quot;. 
Judging by a gif on the Oculus blog showing an in-headset advert, it looks like players can point at an advert to click on a link or save it for later. There&#x27;s also a drop-down menu to report and hide ads, and an option to tweak user preferences.

Cawthon confirmed his decision in a statement shared to ScottGames.com, accompanied by Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s artwork drawn by an unnamed eight-year-old fan.
There&#x27;s no mention of the controversy in his statement, save for a reference to him receiving support from the LGBTQ community - a nod to the recent criticism faced by him for supporting Republican candidates with broadly anti-LGBTQ stances.

Now the dust has settled, some excellent fan theories have emerged about what&#x27;s going on - especially regarding Link&#x27;s seemingly-corrupted arm. 

In a thread on Twitter about Link&#x27;s appendage, freelance writer and Eurogamer contributor 
Jordan Oloman highlighted how Link appears to lose his arm at the beginning of the trailer, before it appears to be restored with Sheikah technology.

Season 4 launched this morning, and buried within the patch notes is word Warzone now has 120hz support for PS5. This requires HDMI 2.1.
It&#x27;s a surprise but welcome addition, and hopefully heralds similar updates from other PS4 games running in back compat form on PS5.

The pack&#x27;s Samus amiibo will add an extra energy tank to your health, increasing its overall capacity by 100 HP. These permanent power-ups are often hard to find in Metroid games, but you&#x27;ll get one easily here.

                    <span>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a mobile data standard that was widely used in the early 2000s. The first encryption algorithm for that standard was GEA-1, a stream cipher built on three linear-feedback shift registers and a non-linear combining function. Although the algorithm has a 64-bit key, the effective key length is only 40 bits, due to “an exceptional interaction of the deployed LFSRs and the key initialization, which is highly unlikely to occur by chance.”

                    <span>While there was plenty to get excited about in Nintendo&#x27;s busy E3 showcase, one notable absence came in the form of No More Heroes 3 - the latest entry in developer Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s cult-classic action-adventure series - which is coming to Switch in just a few short months. However, Nintendo has now made up for that no-show, sharing 20 minutes of new gameplay in a special Nintendo Treehouse livestream.
Announced back in 2019, No More Heroes 3 - which is set nine years after the events of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle and two years after Travis Strikes Again - once again casts players as otaku and sometime-assassin Travis Touchdown. However, while previous games saw Travis murdering his way to the top of the United Assassins Association league, this third series entry ushers in a new threat, with players now charged with eliminating extraterrestrial enemies in order to reach number one in the Galactic Superhero Rankings.
As seen in Nintendo&#x27;s new &quot;early look&quot; at No More Heroes 3, the series&#x27; wonderfully satisfying hack-and-slash action - built around Travis&#x27; lightsaber-like Beam Katana - makes a return, with no obvious surprises where core mechanics are concerned. Players will again need to combine the likes of basic moves, heavy moves, kicks, blocks, and rolls to defeat enemies (motion controls are optional) with the likes of finishers and jackpot bonuses also returning.

                    <span>The long-lived Grand Theft Auto Online will finally shut down its PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 servers on 16th December 2021. 
In a blog post, Rockstar said it had made the decision to shutter the service for last-last-gen consoles as it prepares to launch GTA Online for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S (the game&#x27;s third console generation to date).
Shark Cash Cards will no longer be sold for PS3 and Xbox 360 after 15th September. Grand Theft Auto 5&#x27;s Story Mode will not be impacted.

                    <span>You&#x27;ve thought it, I&#x27;ve thought it, but the question of what London would look like in the Fallout universe has never truly been answered... until now. 
A Fallout mod team is working on a huge project called Fallout: London, which is described as a &quot;DLC-sized mod for Bethesda&#x27;s Fallout 4&quot;. Although the team has been issuing updates on progress for some time, yesterday the group released a full reveal trailer, and the work done so far looks extremely impressive. Many of London&#x27;s most iconic landmarks have been given a Fallout makeover - including Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and even the BT Tower. Oh, and there&#x27;s some extremely hammy commentary over the whole thing. 
There are some really nice touches throughout the trailer: you can spot plenty of London buses, murky tube stations and even a classic London pub. I&#x27;m also a big fan of the Beefeater who&#x27;s embraced a more Raider-inspired look. It feels like there are some nods to Britain&#x27;s involvement in WWI and WWII, with barrage balloons seen in the sky and soldiers camping out in trenches.

                    <span>The Medium launches on PlayStation 5 on 3rd September, developer Bloober Team has announced.
Its release on PS5 was expected after a rating for the game on Sony&#x27;s console was spotted on the The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) website. The new trailer is below:
Bloober Team&#x27;s well-received third-person psychological horror game The Medium launched digitally for Xbox Series X and S and PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store, as well as via Xbox Game Pass, in January.

                    <span>Microsoft has said how it plans to keep Xbox One going next year even as developers make use of more powerful hardware: cloud streaming.
In a post on Xbox Wire, Microsoft said some exclusives set for 2022 require the power of the Xbox Series X and S and so will use Xbox Cloud Gaming to run on the eight-year old Xbox One.
Microsoft confirmed it will use Xbox Cloud Gaming to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, to Xbox One.

                    <span>TorrentFreak surveyed nineteen VPN providers, asking them questions about their privacy practices: what data they keep, how they respond to court order, what country they are incorporated in, and so on.
Most interesting to me is the home countries of these companies. Express VPN is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. NordVPN is incorporated in Panama. There are VPNs from the Seychelles, Malaysia, and Bulgaria. There are VPNs from more traditional companies like the U.S., Switzerland, Canada, and Sweden. Presumably all of those companies follow the laws on their home country...</span>

                    <span>Koei Tecmo is resurrecting its celebrated picture-snapping survival horror series, Project Zero, bringing its most recent instalment - Wii U&#x27;s Maiden of Black Water - to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC later this year.
Released back in 2015, Maiden of Black Water is the fifth main entry in the Project Zero series (known as Fatal Frame in the US) and once again arms players with a magic camera - used to battle spirits by taking their picture, which is considerably more unnerving than it sounds.
Unfortunately, while Project Zero&#x27;s first three entries are brilliant (and genuinely terrifying) survival horror offerings, Maiden of Black Water - set on the fictional Mount Hikami, known for its suicides and ghostly goings-on - is a bit of a dud.

In a post on EA&#x27;s website, DICE discussed the addition of AI soldiers to the series with Battlefield 2042.
Battlefield 2042 supports 128 players on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game support 64 players. As Eurogamer reported last week, Battlefield 2042 does not have a campaign.

                    <span>If you fancy a tour through some of Mario Party&#x27;s back catalogue, well, Mario Party Superstars sounds like just the ticket - and it&#x27;s arriving this October. 
The game was announced as part of today&#x27;s Nintendo E3 Direct, and promises a whirlwind ride through some classic Mario Party games. It&#x27;s somewhere between a new Mario Party title and remake, essentially mixing elements of previous games into a new collection. This includes five classic Mario Party boards from the N64 era, with boards such as Peach&#x27;s Birthday Cake and Space Land making a reappearance. 
Mario Party Superstars also promises a bunch of minigames from the series&#x27; catalogue - 100 in total, in fact - along with the usual mix of zany board events. All the minigames support button controls.

                    <span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 will launch in 2022, Nintendo has confirmed. 
The hugely-anticipated sequel was shown off today at the very end of Nintendo&#x27;s E3 presentation in a new trailer which revealed new powers, new enemies, and new gameplay in the skies of Hyrule.
The ability to visit floating islands is reminiscent of Skyward Sword, the Wii Zelda entry which is getting a re-release this summer. This time, the islands look larger, and Link will be able to glide through the sky between them.

Title Advance Wars 1+2: Re-boot Camp, the surprise bundle features 3D remakes - &quot;reimagined and rebuilt from the ground-up&quot; - of the original Advance Wars and its sequel Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising (which originally released on Gameboy Advance in 2001 and 2003 respectively), which should make long-starved series fans very happy indeed. Although obviously not quite as happy as if it had been a brand-new game.
Advance Wars 1+2: Re-boot Camp is coming to Switch later this year on 3rd December.

                    <span>WarioWare is back, with WarioWare: Get it Together hitting Switch on the 10th of September.
The announcement was part of Nintendo&#x27;s E3 Direct. The gimmick? Get It Together sees players controlling the WarioWare characters inside the mini-games. So we see Wario squeezing toothpaste out of a giant tube and peeling off a facemask and dodging bird poo, for example. Elsewhere, other WarioWare characters have new talents - 9Volt uses a yo-yo to turn the blades of a windmill in one game - and different characters will be able to use their own specific abilities to complete each challenge.
This idea comes into its own in a new two-player mode which sees players competing or collaborating on a single screen. The micro-games shown throughout the reveal were very classical Wario type experiences, with a lovely swipe-file mix of styles and production values. I can&#x27;t wait.

                    <span>Metroid Dread, the sequel to Metroid Fusion, has a long, long history of being vapourware. But now, after almost 20 years, it is real. Really. 
Nintendo has just announced Metroid Dread will launch for Switch on 8th October. A subsequent Nintendo Treehouse presentation confirmed it was being developed by Nintendo and Metroid: Samus Returns studio MercurySteam. 
Footage revealed during today&#x27;s E3 Direct showed Samus being chased by a robot through various side-scrolling 2D environments. (Of course, both Samus and the robot, EMMI, are also being turned into new amiibo.)

                    <span>Kazuya from Tekken is the next Super Smash Bros. Ultimate DLC character, Nintendo has announced.
Revealed during the Nintendo Direct show, Kazuya in Smash has many of the moves Tekken fans are familiar with, including Spinning Demon and Stonehead. He&#x27;s even got his famous 10-hit combo.
The announcement video includes a cutscene showing Kazuya chucking existing Smash characters off a cliff - that&#x27;s a reference to the famous Tekken cutscene in which Kazuya&#x27;s dad, Heihachi, chucks Kazuya off a cliff.

Gorgeous sci-fi adventure Sable is in the mix (which I&#x27;d thoroughly recommend trying out based on my own hands-on time with the game). There&#x27;s also Tunic, a Zelda-like game with a fox as the main protagonist. 
Elsewhere on the list, you can also find Black Book - a dark RPG adventure based on slavic myths in which you play as a young sorceress and fight in card-based battles. Arietta of Spirits is a retro-inspired adventure telling an emotional story of a girl and her family who visit her grandmother&#x27;s cabin for the first time since she passed away. Echo Generation, meanwhile, is a turn-based adventure game with a real Stranger Things vibe to it:

                    <span>Planet Zoo continues its slow and steady march toward cramming in all the animals next week with the advent of its latest DLC, which introduces a range of new Africa-themed wildlife, including the meerkat, southern white rhinoceros, and more.
Arriving next Tuesday, 22nd June, Planet Zoo&#x27;s Africa Pack DLC features a total of five new animals. The meerkat will display &quot;authentic new digging behaviour&quot;, according to developer Frontier, and is joined by the aforementioned southern white rhinoceros, a couple of cuties in the form of the African penguin and fenec fox, plus the sacred scarab beetle - which is sure to delight visitors as its goes about its day rolling up poop.
Alongside its animal additions, the Africa Pack brings a new timed scenario, new enrichments items (such as the disco ball), plus over 180 new scenery pieces inspired by African architecture.

                    <span>Loop Hero&#x27;s first big update has been revealed, and it adds some cool new features.
As part of this update, the wonderful endless role-playing game gets a save on the go feature. This lets you save and exit the game in the middle of an expedition, preserving your progress.
Loop Hero&#x27;s expeditions can go on for quite a while, so being able to save on the go is welcome.

It turns out, for $350 (about £250), it probably could.
Peripheral manufacturer Turtle Beach has announced the VelocityOne Flight system: a yoke handle and lever control set meant to work with Microsoft Flight Simulator on either Xbox or PC.

                    <span>100-player WW2 first-person shooter Hell Let Loose hits new-gen consoles this year.
Black Matter&#x27;s shooter launched on Steam as an Early Access title in June 2019 and has enjoyed a positive reception. It leaves Early Access on PC and launches proper there on 27th July. It then comes out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S late 2021.
The console announcement trailer is below:

                    <span>Well, it looks like the front of Xbox game cases are getting a very slight refresh, as box art images spotted on BestBuy appear to show a newly re-designed version of the standard Xbox Series X game case. 
As you can see from these Halo Infinite and Flight Simulator listings, more of the box is taken up with game art rather than additional Xbox logos at the top, and the console banner has become a little shorter and wider. The banner has also changed colour from black to white - as if someone&#x27;s flipped a switch to put it in light mode. 
Social media account Xbox News also managed to spot a version for Forza Horizon 5, which you can see below. It&#x27;s worth noting that the big &quot;optimised for Series X&quot; badge was removed from cases last year following negative feedback from fans.

                    <span>THQ Nordic has announced Elex 2, the next game from Piranha Bytes.
It&#x27;s down as &quot;coming soon&quot; to PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One. The announcement trailer is below:
Elex 2 is the sequel to post-apocalyptic sci-fi open-world role-playing game Elex, which Piranha Bytes&#x27; released in 2017. &quot;Hokey, uneven and janky, Elex is nonetheless a compelling throwback to a time before open worlds became choose your own to-do lists,&quot; Richie Shoemaker wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Elex review.

                    <span>Guilty Gear Strive has sold more than 300,000 copies since going on sale last week, developer Arc System Works has announced.
That includes shipments of physical copies and downloads, the developer said in a tweet.
Strive got off to a great start on PC, and hit peak Steam concurrents of over 31,000 players, according to SteamDB.

                    <span>The live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series in the works at Netflix has signed up Jeb Stuart as its writer, according to Variety.
Most recently, and perhaps most relevantly, Stuart created Vikings spin-off Vikings: Valhalla, a spin-off from the popular Norse telly drama which is also Netflix-bound. 
Further back, more years than I care to mention, Stuart also wrote the screenplay for the legendary Die Hard.

In a blog post, Turtle Rock said if your party leader owns a paid content drop, you will be able to play that content with them. This includes maps, gameplay and campaign.
&quot;No separation. No exclusion. No split,&quot; Turtle Rock said.

                    <span>Rare&#x27;s mysterious fantasy deer adventure Everwild is now pencilled in for 2024, according to a new report. 
Everwild, alongside various other far-off Microsoft exclusives, was absent from this year&#x27;s Bethesda-dominated Xbox E3 showcase. That is because its development has undergone a reboot, and its launch window pushed back, according to a VGC report.
But while we won&#x27;t see Everwild for some time, there&#x27;s reason to be optimistic for the project. Rare veteran Gregg Mayles, who has served at the studio for more than 30 years, was recently brought on as its creative director.

Rush is a map included in the Vengeance downloadable content pack for the 2012 shooter. It takes place in the premises of a commercial paintball outfit.

Based on preliminary reports published by the team of experts that New Hampshire engaged to examine an election discrepancy, it appears that a buildup of dust in the read heads of optical-scan voting machines (possibly over several years of use) can cause paper-fold lines in absentee ballots to be interpreted as votes… New Hampshire (and other states) may need to maintain the accuracy of their optical-scan voting machines by paying attention to three issues:...</span>

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 4 kicks off this week, and brings with it new points of interest to the map.
Satellite crash sites will be plainly visible in Verdansk &#x27;84, with the debris and impact on the landscape &quot;significant&quot;, Activision said in a blog post. These sites offer new opportunities for cover, and the satellites themselves can also be secured.
You can interact with the Sat-Links found in these areas to work toward receiving permanent rewards in the Ground Fall event at the beginning of the season. You can also obtain items to use during the match, such as killstreaks, vehicles, and field upgrades.

                    <span>As part of its E3 2021 livestream, Capcom has offered up a sprinkling of new Monster Hunter news, including confirmation that Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s first collaboration event will arrive this Friday, and that there&#x27;s a Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin demo coming next week.
Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, the latest entry in Capcom&#x27;s RPG spin-off series, comes to Switch and PC on 9th July, but interested parties will be able to download a trial version of the game next Friday, 25th June. Capcom notes all progress made in the demo will be transferable to the main game on release.
Additionally, Capcom confirmed it&#x27;ll be supporting Monster Hunter Stories 2 after launch with free title updates, the first of which will see Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Palamute join the game as a rideable Monstie on 9th July. And if you still haven&#x27;t had your fill of Monster Hunter Stories 2 trailers, here&#x27;s another one now.

                    <span>Capcom confirmed that DLC for the game had just entered into production &quot;by popular demand&quot;. That was all the detail we got, but it&#x27;ll probably focus on Lady D, won&#x27;t it?
Additionally, Resident Evil RE:Verse, the delayed free multiplayer component for Village owners, will finally arrive in July. This lets you play as various Resident Evil characters from throughout the series, though its earlier beta recieved a mixed reception.

                    <span>It looks like Sega might not be quite done with its spherically ensconced simians just yet; images have surfaced for a new entry in the long-running Super Monkey Ball series, this one titled Banana Mania, supposedly heading to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Series X/S.
The images in question, shared by freelance journalist Nils Ahrensmeier on Twitter earlier today, purportedly show PlayStation 5 and Switch box art for Banana Mania, alongside four typically cheery screenshots from the game.
One of these shots teases a return for Monkey Ball&#x27;s much-loved party game Monkey Target, while the others are a little harder to pin down. However, a few well-versed Monkey Ball fans are currently doing some deductive work and speculating that the images could well be pointing to a remake of 2005&#x27;s Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, which melded the first two Monkey Ball games along with brand-new content.

                    <span>Developer Okomotive has revealed Far: Changing Tides, the follow-up to its acclaimed post-apocalyptic vehicle adventure Far: Lone Sails, which is out on PC and consoles later this year.
Changing Tides sends players on a fresh bout of genteel side-scrolling vehicular management. This time, however, instead of embarking on a tank-y trundle across a dried-out ocean, they&#x27;ll be following the horizon for some boat-based adventure above and beneath the waves.
&quot;Set sail and discover the wonders of a flooded world filled with mystery,&quot; explains Okomotive. &quot;Traverse the ruins of a once great society and use the pieces from its past to build a brighter future. Dive into unknown depths on the hunt for precious fuel and salvage, devise innovative solutions to overcome intricate obstacles, and unearth forgotten relics lost to time.&quot;

                    <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s release date reveal for Flight Simulator on Xbox Series X/S, Microsoft has shared a few additional details - including confirmation that it&#x27;ll run at 30fps on console - via the time-honoured mediums of FAQ and Twitter.
Those frame rate details come via the official Microsoft Flight Simulator Twitter feed, which, in response to queries from a number of curious punters, confirmed that Xbox Series X/S players can expect a base frame rate of 30fps. It noted, however, that frame rates above 30fps are possible on TVs supporting variable refresh rates (VRR).
Over on the official Flight Simulator&#x27;s FAQ, meanwhile, most additional details provided aim to clarify questions around how the console edition will interact with the version already released on PC, and confirm, for instance, that those who own the Windows Store version on PC won&#x27;t need to purchase the console edition again.

                    <span>At long last, we finally got a proper look at Elden Ring during Summer Games Fest last week, and all of a sudden we now have a flood of information about what to expect in the upcoming game. In an interview with IGN, legendary director Hidetaka Miyazaki gave plenty of information on the background lore, along with some discussion of abilities, multiplayer and the game&#x27;s structure.
One of the first topics discussed was Elden Ring&#x27;s setting, The Lands Between, which has been deliberately designed to give &quot;an enormous sense of scale and this broadness and openness&quot;. It&#x27;s split into six major areas, each of which is the domain of a demigod. These are lined up to suggest a specific order in which to tackle them, but the player can make their own decisions about which to do first. &quot;You won&#x27;t be able to access everything from the start, but there are a lot of different ways you can approach each area,&quot; Miyazaki explained. &quot;And there&#x27;s a lot of freedom as to which order you tackle different areas as well.&quot;
Players will be able to access a hub area a little later in the game, which you can &quot;branch out from&quot;, and also the six main areas of The Lands Between. &quot;These will be the domains or the areas of the main demigod bosses,&quot; Miyazaki explained. &quot;From here, you&#x27;re able to explore not only these mainline dungeon areas, but also a wide variety of catacombs, castles, and fortresses, which are interspersed throughout the map. These have a range of scale and scope, but the main dungeons are these six - these are the ones that you&#x27;re going to be heading to on your adventures throughout the main world. &quot;

                    <span>Tomorrow&#x27;s update for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla adds a new Mastery Challenge mode to the game. 
Update 1.2.2 will arrive for PC, PlayStation, Stadia and Xbox around 1pm UK time and also adds new skills, river raid cosmetics and other improvements. 
Mastery Challenge mode is the big addition, and can be found at &quot;numerous shrines hidden in the world&quot;, Ubisoft said in its patch notes. Each shrine will host a Trial of the Bear, testing your combat strength, a Trial of the Wolf, testing your ranged ability, and a Trial of the Raven, testing your stealth.

                    <span>343 has revealed more information about Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer in a new video.
The video, below, includes new Halo Infinite multiplayer gameplay as well as a raft of talking heads from 343.
There&#x27;s a lot to run through, but the highlight for me was the news that Halo Infinite multiplayer lets you bring your own Personal AI onto the battlefield.

                    <span>Lego has detailed a third set of Super Mario Character Packs to be released in blind bags this summer. 
As with previous waves, there are 10 additional enemies and items to collect, and you&#x27;ll need a bit of luck to obtain the full set with no duplicates. (Or to swap with a friend. Or eBay.)
There&#x27;s no release date or price yet for Series 3, but we&#x27;d expect these to cost the same as the last two waves (£3.49/$4.99/€3.99 each) and arrive alongside the upcoming Super Luigi Starter Course on 1st August.

                    <span>Remember that brightly-coloured alien exploration game In Other Waters? Well, the developer is back with another sci-fi offering, although this time it&#x27;s all taking place on a run-down space station. 
Titled Citizen Sleeper, the game was previously teased under the name Project Sidereal, but developer Jump Over The Age revealed the new name and trailer during last night&#x27;s PC Gaming Show. It&#x27;s described as &quot;roleplaying in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism,&quot; with the player taking the role of a &quot;sleeper&quot; - in other words, a digitised human consciousness. The bad news is that you&#x27;re also owned by a huge corporation that wants you back, and your body will deteriorate as part of &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; for escapees. This what happens when billionaires start jetting themselves into space, I guess. 
&quot;Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle,&quot; the Steam description explains. &quot;Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom.&quot;

                    <span>By now, you will likely have seen Bethesda&#x27;s first in-game footage of Starfield, its long-awaited sci-fi role-playing game coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S as a console exclusive on 11th November 2022. 
But how will it play? What will you actually do? And will we ever get to finish that half-eaten space sandwich?
Bethesda has given a couple of interviews which mostly avoid answering specifics, but do touch a bit on some of the above.

                    <span>Last week, Sony announced it had signed a deal with Deviation Games to make a brand new PlayStation IP - the second such deal Sony has announced in recent months.
Deviation Games was set up in November 2019 by former Treyarch Studios developers Dave Anthony and Jason Blundell, both of whom played a key role in the success of the Call of Duty: Black Ops series.
Blundell, one of the chief creators of Call of Duty&#x27;s popular zombies mode, left Treyarch after 13 years at the developer.

                    <span>Somerville has been teased with a number of trailers over the past few years, but during yesterday&#x27;s Xbox-Bethesda showcase we got another look at the game - and now have some idea of what the main characters will look like.  
The sci-fi adventure is being made by Jumpship, an independent studio founded by animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Playdead co-founder and former CEO Dino Patti. (Playdead created Limbo and its spiritual successor Inside, two very unsettling puzzle-platformers.) 
As you can see from the trailer, Somerville set in a sci-fi world and focuses on the struggles of a family trying to survive a major disaster. &quot;In the wake of catastrophe you must find the means to make your family whole again,&quot; says the official description. &quot;Somerville is a sci-fi adventure grounded in the intimate repercussions of large-scale conflict.

Microsoft is really going to release this dinky desk-sized refrigerator later this year. Like Halo Infinite, it has a vague &quot;holiday 2021&quot; launch date. 
If you stuck around after Microsoft&#x27;s big Xbox and Bethesda Showcase event yesterday, you&#x27;ll have seen the following trailer pop up, showing off how it&#x27;ll look:

                    <span>Her Story and Telling Lies director Sam Barlow has announced a new game, and this one is all about a mysterious disappearing film star. 
Titled Immortality, the game follows the story of Marissa Marcel, an actress who &quot;made three movies&quot; that were never actually released. Oh, and she vanished without a trace, of course. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the teaser trailer that was shown during the Future Games showcase last night:

                    <span>Tinykin may be the closest thing we get to a Pikmin 4 at this year&#x27;s E3, but that&#x27;s no bad thing. 
This dinky puzzle platformer has you controlling a miniature alien astronaut as he explores our world. He&#x27;s aided in his travels by a swarm of mini creatures, named tinykin. 
Sound familiar? While clearly inspired by Nintendo&#x27;s Pikmin, what impressed me here was how snappy and fluid the movement and exploration looks, with tinykin used to create ladders or skate around.

But perhaps it plays better? It&#x27;s impossible to say right now, as the game&#x27;s instantly-dropped PlayStation 5 demo remains broken, and unable to play.
Curious Final Fantasy fans first reported an inability to load the demo after downloading it last night. This morning, our Aoife told me it&#x27;s still not working.

                    <span>Tower defense title Orcs Must Die 3 will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation and Xbox on 23rd July. 
That&#x27;s almost exactly a year on from its original release as a timed-exclusive for Stadia, back in July 2020. The news was confirmed this evening, as part of the PC Gaming Show.
The latest game in the Orcs Must Die series features solo and co-op play, and a campaign set 25 years after that of Orcs Must Die 2. Clearly, you were not successful enough at getting rid of all those orcs last time around.

You&#x27;ll hear people&#x27;s inner thoughts, and use this to learn secrets - though what you do with this information is up to you. Powerful emotions will let Alex experience someone&#x27;s emotional state, and see a changed version of her surroundings, but also put Alex in a place where she&#x27;s experiencing that emotion too.

                    <span>Back in May, rumours began circulating that Square Enix was collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off titled Final Fantasy Origin. Well, it turns out those rumours weren&#x27;t far off at all! Square has now officially unveiled Team Ninja&#x27;s action-RPG Final Fantasy spin-off, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins.
Stranger of Paradise follows a band of adventurers who, as the trailer repeatedly reminds us, want to kill chaos. Or at least stab it in the face a few times until its head pops off. &quot;Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine,&quot; Square elaborates in its announcement, &quot;Yet doubts remain-are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?&quot;.
May&#x27;s rumours suggested the game would slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja&#x27;s Nioh games and From Software&#x27;s Souls series, albeit with a more accessible focus, and today&#x27;s reveal appears to support that. Square is promising &quot;exhilarating, action-packed battles&quot; against iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a &quot;world of dark fantasy&quot;.

                    <span>Hitman Sniper: The Shadows is a free-to-play mobile spin-off without hero Agent 47, developed by Hitman Go developer Square Enix Montreal.
Formerly titled Project Hitman Sniper Assassins, the game will take place in a new fictional universe unrelated to the main Hitman series or Hitman Sniper.
Instead of Agent 47, who has disappeared, you&#x27;ll follow a new group of assassins - Soji, Kiya, Kolzak, Knight, and Stone - activated by the International Contract Agency (ICA) following the rise of a new criminal network.

                    <span>Platinum Games&#x27; long-awaited Square Enix title Babylon&#x27;s Fall is now coming to PS5 as well as PS4 and PC. This was announced during Square Enix&#x27;s E3 showcase this evening.
The game&#x27;s also going live-service. The publisher treated audiences to a fairly brief trailer, featuring in-game footage of a frantic 3D action game with lots of armour and magical lightning and some decent operatic music. A follow-up developer interview revealed a game in which teams of players enjoy hack-and-slash combat and explore dungeons in groups of four. These dungeons are located on different floors of a giant tower, and end with a boss.
Regular updates will allow for new moves that can be equipped as skills. There&#x27;s a focus on character customisation and crafting, and a massive emphasis on builds, due to a &quot;Gideon coffin&quot; the characters wear that allows them to equip two additional weapons alongside the weapons they hold in their hands, and, I think, swing them about independently, a la Astral Chain. The game will ship with five weapon types, and there will be a website that allows players to tweak their builds while they&#x27;re away from the game.

                    <span>The Bethesda and Xbox showcase ended with a twist this evening, with the announcement of a brand-new game from Dishonored and Prey developer Arkane Studios.  
Titled Redfall, the game is an open-world co-op shooter arriving in summer 2022. It&#x27;s being developed by Arkane Austin, and judging by the trailer, it looks like it will feature... well, a lot of vampires and shooting.
While we don&#x27;t yet know exactly what the gameplay will look like, it will feature co-op with up to four players. &quot;Redfall blends single and multiplayer options seamlessly, allowing the player to venture into the darkness alone or to squad-up with up to three friends for four-player co-op&quot;, a Bethesda press release explained. &quot;Teammates can try different hero loadouts and combine their strengths to overcome the vampire legion and their brood of maniacal followers.&quot;

Microsoft Flight Simulator received much praise when it launched on PC at the end of last year, in large part thanks to its utterly staggering rendition of the entire world - one that Asobo has continued to build on with regular free sim updates and visual overhauls for the likes of Japan, the United States, France, Benelux, the UK, and Ireland.
&quot;From light planes to wide-body jets,&quot; explains Microsoft of its flight sim, &quot;you&#x27;ll test your piloting skills against the challenges of real-time weather, including accurate worldwide cloud cover and cloud layers, wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, rain, and lightning - all in a dynamic and living world. With the power of satellite data and cloud-based AI, you&#x27;ll travel the entire planet in amazing detail with over 37,000 airports, 2 million cities, 1.5 billion buildings, real mountain ranges, roads, trees, rivers, animals, traffic, and more.&quot;

The Pitt was the second add-on for Fallout 3, Bethesda&#x27;s 2008 sci-fi role-playing game. It was an atmospheric setting that depicted post-nuclear Pittsburgh.
The Pitt arrives as an Expedition for Fallout 76. It&#x27;s a free update that will, for the first time, take players outside of Appalachia. Expeditions are story driven, repeatable missions to various locales in the Fallout universe - starting with The Pitt in 2022. The trailer is below:

The trailer itself showed off some naval battles, all kinds of horse, camel and elephant cavalry, and some notable historical figures, like Joan of Arc.
There was also plenty of siege and town-based action, and lots of people in armour running at each other on nice grassy hills, which is exactly what we want.

                    <span>Microsoft has offered a first look at Halo Infinite multiplayer.
The video, below, shows some gameplay from the player&#x27;s perspective, with lots of non-gameplay angles, too.
Halo Infinite, due out &quot;holiday 2021&quot; on Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via the Microsoft Store and Steam, as well as Xbox Game Pass day one, offers free-to-play multiplayer.

                    <span>The Outer Worlds is getting a sequel for PC and Xbox Series X/S. It&#x27;s called The Outer Worlds 2. 
In a humorous CGI trailer, developer Obsidian cheekily acknowledged there was not much else to show of the game as yet, and no word on a release window. Still, it&#x27;s nice to know its coming.
&quot;New solar system, new crew, same Outer Worlds,&quot; the trailer&#x27;s description reads. &quot;The Outer Worlds 2 is coming... and when that day is closer we will show you more... but until then enjoy this.&quot;

                    <span>Fans of rat-themed stealth-action rejoice! Developer Adobo&#x27;s enormously enjoyable A Plague Tale is getting a sequel and it&#x27;s coming to Xbox and PC some time next year.
Picking up after the events of the first game, A Plague Tale: Requiem, as the sequel is known, will follow Amicia and her brother Hugo on a perilous new quest, &quot;doing whatever it takes to survive a brutal, uncaring world.&quot;
That&#x27;s pretty much all we&#x27;re getting at the moment, but expect plenty more details as A Plague Tale: Requiem readies to launch on Xbox and PC - as well as Game Pass - some time next year.

                    <span>Grounded, the game about being very small and trapped in your own back yard, is getting a new update. The Shroom &amp; Doom update was announced at this year&#x27;s Microsoft and Bethesda E3 showcase, and looks really pretty wonderful.
WARNING: BIG SPIDER IN THE TRAILER BELOW.
The update allows for sitting (apparently this was heavily requested), pets and a new giant spider called the Brood Mother. Not fun.

                    <span>Psychonauts 2 is arriving on 25th August, as announced during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase this evening.
The third-person platformer has seen a series of delays, with developer Double Fine previously explaining that it needed more time to bring it up to standard, and that the studio needed time to adjust to its acquisition by Microsoft. It looks like we&#x27;ll finally see the results of all this hard work soon, however, and Double Fine provided a fresh peek at Psychonauts 2 with a gameplay trailer shown during the showcase livestream:  
&quot;Psychonauts 2 is an exciting journey through the mind filled with the signature Double Fine humor and heart, and a touch of next-level platforming,&quot; says the official blog post. &quot;You play as Razputin Aquato, a trained acrobat and powerful young psychic, who has realized his lifelong dream of joining the international psychic espionage organization known as the Psychonauts. But these psychic super spies are in trouble. Raz must use his powers to bring the murderous psychic villain, Maligula, back from the dead! Check out the video above and get psyched!&quot;

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 got a new trailer in Xbox&#x27;s E3 showcase, and it&#x27;s a silly one.
It&#x27;s all in-game captured footage from an Xbox Series X, showing off the chaos of the game&#x27;s new 128-person battles and a range of new toys.
The highlights include a tank being air-dropped into battle via parachute, a grappling hook that should open up some new opportunities for the more ingenuitive campers (and anti-campers), some cross-skyscraper ziplines, a desert cyclone, and a rocket launching into the atmosphere. There&#x27;s a nice tone to it all, too - clearly DICE is aware of the more ridiculous stunts the Battlefield community has become known for pulling off.

                    <span>Two swashbuckling worlds are set to collide next Tuesday, 22nd June, when Sea of Thieves joins forces with Disney&#x27;s Pirate of the Caribbean to go on a grand new adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow and friends.
Arriving alongside the third season of content for Rare&#x27;s multiplayer pirate game, Sea of Thieves: A Pirate&#x27;s Life, as the crossover is known, will send players on a new five-episode story campaign, playable either solo or in a crew, involving the world&#x27;s greatest Pirate Treasure, which Jack Sparrow just so happens to have stolen. 
Davy Jones, inevitably, isn&#x27;t far behind, and the adventure will see players setting sail to visit new locations from both universes - including some from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park rides that didn&#x27;t quite make it into the movies.

The game features Bake-Off talent Daisy Ridley and James McAvoy, alongside Willem Defoe, who was not on Bake-Off. But that hasn&#x27;t held him back. The game will be out on Xbox and PC, and features a couple facing a home invasion in 12 minute looping bursts.
Oh, here&#x27;s another sentence because of the ad next to the early text on this page. Enjoy.

While many of the candidates Cawthon backed are conservative and sit within America&#x27;s right-leaning Republican party, Cawthon insists that &quot;for those who took the time to look&quot;, they&#x27;d see that the candidates he supported &quot;included men, women, white people, black people, republicans, and democrats&quot;. 
Directly addressing his community on Reddit, Cawthon also took the time to discuss why he supports Republicans despite their broadly anti-LGBTQIA+ stance, stating &quot;even if there were candidates who had better things to say to the LGBT community directly, and bigger promises to make, I believed that their stances on other issues would have ended up doing much greater harm to those communities than good&quot;.

                    <span>Indie studio Dimfrost has shared a new teaser for its upcoming horror adventure game, Bramble: The Mountain King.
Though still a little ways off - right now, the only release window we have is &quot;2022&quot; - the trailer shows the game&#x27;s gorgeous style and soundtrack, as well as offer a glimpse of the &quot;monstrous troll&quot; that kidnaps the lead character&#x27;s older sister.
Here, take a peek:

                    <span>Town of Light developer LKA has dropped a new video teaser for its upcoming psychological thriller, Martha Is Dead.
The trailer doesn&#x27;t give away much, but it does touch upon the Tale of the White Lady, &quot;the spirit of a murdered, tortured soul whose one goal is to seek a moment&#x27;s relief by dragging others into the water to suffer the same fate&quot;.
The &quot;savage story&quot; told in the video is reportedly based upon a real-life Italian legend, which is purportedly passed down through from generation to generation much as it&#x27;s done in this trailer, with the young Giulia badgering her grandmother to tell her the spooky story of &quot;a drowned maiden, murdered in a fit of jealousy by her lover who now stalks the shores of the lake where she suffered in her final moments&quot;.

                    <span>The Crew has clocked up 30 million players since the franchise first launched back in 2014.
The milestone was announced as part of last night&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation (you can catch up now courtesy of Martin&#x27;s excellent on-the-night liveblogging right here).
&quot;This year has been an incredibly intense one for The Crew 2 and everybody at Ivory Tower,&quot; the team explains on the official website. &quot;We managed to deliver an update every four months, as well as a new episode every two months. Our teams have successfully shipped all the content we promised a year ago.&quot;

While developer Ubisoft stopped short of outlining when the betas will launch, it does, however, invite players to register their interest in trying out the &quot;massive multiplayer outdoor sports playground&quot; via upcoming betas.
Even without details on when the beta tests will go live, players interested in trying Riders Republic ahead of its launch can register their interest now on the official website. Though there&#x27;s not much information on the website just yet, it does intimate that betas will be available on all platforms Riders Republic is coming to, including Google Stadia.

                    <span>ratings board leak earlier this year, it is now confirmed that Godfall, the PC and PlayStation 5 fantasy looter published by Gearbox, will also launch for PS4.
It is perhaps surprising to see the visually-impressive role-player getting ported to last-gen - not that we saw much of what that PS4 version might look like today. But this move will, obviously, open up the game to a wider audience.
Today also brought word of Fire &amp; Darkness, a new expansion for Godfall which adds in a new realm, new story, and a hoard of new loot.

There was some eye-catching stuff shown during the show, which was one big piss-take of subscriptions, games as a service and video game monetisation. The video of the entire &quot;Devolver MaxPass+ Showcase | Monetization as a Service&quot; is below, and below that are trailers for all the games.
Let&#x27;s start with Trek to Yomi, a &quot;cinematic tour-de-force&quot; inspired by classic samurai films from director Leonard Menchiari and Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind the 2013 reboot of Shadow Warrior and its 2016 sequel, Shadow Warrior 2.

                    <span>Cast your mind back to 2017, and you might recall Ubisoft announcing it was working on a new video game adaptation of James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar movie. Five years of almost complete silence around the project followed, but all that&#x27;s now changed, with Ubisoft showing the first footage of its Avatar game, now titled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, during its E3 livestream.
&quot;In this new, standalone story,&quot; explains Ubisoft, &quot;play as a Na&#x27;vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back the formidable RDA forces that threaten it.&quot;
Ubisoft is calling Frontiers of Pandora a first-person action-adventure and a &quot;immersive, open world experience&quot;, and its trailer - running on the latest version of Ubisoft&#x27;s Snowdrop Engine, according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot - offers a jaunt through a gorgeous rendition of the planet Pandora, complete with all the exotic flora and fauna you could possible hope for.

                    <span>Humankind, Amplitude&#x27;s upcoming, history-spanning 4X game, gets a new closed beta soon, and it&#x27;ll let you play through five of the game&#x27;s six eras. There&#x27;s also a snazzy new trailer to come with the announcement, which you can watch here:
Amplitude&#x27;s done plenty of other betas like this in the past - which the studio refers to as OpenDevs - but this is the furthest into a game of Humankind you&#x27;ll have been able to get, by some way.
You can play either 200 turns or up to the end of the Industrial Era, whichever comes first. Industrial era features include resources like coal and oil, railways, and artillery and air battles - we actually had a chance to explore some more of this ourselves during our latest preview but barely got halfway there, despite playing a good 10 to 15-odd hours, which should give you an idea of just how long you get with this beta.

The name of the game is Extraction, and as you might expect, the aim of the game is to survive until... well, you are extracted. Who would have called this game anything else?!

                    <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will get a second year of expansions, Ubisoft announced tonight during its E3 Forward event. 
This is the first time any game in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series has received this level of post-launch support, but this news isn&#x27;t surprising. Firstly, Valhalla has gone down very well. Secondly, as we reported last month, datamining has pointed to the mythical realm of Muspelheim coming down the line. And, indeed, Ubisoft teased Muspelheim tonight.
Before all that, Valhalla has its previously-announced Siege of Paris expansion coming this summer. No release date for that was shared, but we got a good look at footage. Ubisoft also confirmed the fan-favourite &quot;black box&quot; missions from the series&#x27; past will return here. These are assassination target opportunities where you have a set location and multiple methods to take down a target.

                    <span>Yes, the Just Dance franchise is still going strong, and we now have a release date for the next entry in the series: and it&#x27;s 4th November. 
The news was unveiled during this evening&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream. The announcement also featured celebrity performer and choreographer Todrick Hall (who you may recognise from his appearances on RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race). He released a popular single called Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels in 2019, and this song is set to be included in the line-up for Just Dance 2022. 
The game is due to feature 40 tracks in total, and along with Todrick Hall&#x27;s music you can expect to find Level Up by Ciara and Believer by Imagine Dragons.

                    <span>The ever-popular Rainbow Six Siege will get crossplay support, Ubisoft has announced, though PlayStation and Xbox platforms will have to wait some time.
Crossplay and cross-progression between PC, Stadia and Luna will arrive on 30th June, Ubisoft said tonight during its E3 Ubisoft Forward presentation. 
PlayStation and Xbox crossplay will arrive later, in &quot;early 2022&quot;. At that point, cross-progression between all platforms will then be possible.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wished there was just a little bit more bird in your skateboarding, the adorable, avian-themed SkateBird has you covered - and developer Glass Bottom Games has now confirmed it&#x27;ll be grinding onto Xbox, Switch, Amazon Luna, and PC on 12th August.
In SkateBird, players take on the role of a &quot;chill little skateboarding bird&quot; whose human friend is never home to play, thanks to their job. Luckily, the bird is an enterprising sort and, to help pass the time, has constructed a miniature skating paradise in the form of a homemade skatepark.
Here, players can trick and grind, completing missions and skating their best skate to unlock new bird-sized courses, attract a loyal bird following, and somehow fix their human friend&#x27;s life.

                    <span>The E3 leaks keep on coming: this time it&#x27;s Yakuza: Like a Dragon for Xbox Game Pass.
Confirmation comes from a snapshot of Yakuza: Like a Dragon&#x27;s listing on the Brazilian Microsoft Store. There was mention of &quot;included with Game Pass&quot; for accompanying content. It looks like this reference to Game Pass was swiftly removed, but not before Twitter user @pedroxbz noticed.
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s Yakuza: Like a Dragon launched in Japan for PlayStation 4 in January 2020, before coming out internationally in November that year on multiple platforms. It was a launch title for Xbox Series X and S. It came out on PlayStation 5 four months later, in March.

                    <span>A third Ubisoft E3 reveal has leaked.
As spotted by The Riff Repeater, the latest Gibson email blast fully revealed Rocksmith+, which goes into PC closed beta today.
Rocksmith is Ubisoft&#x27;s guitar teaching game. In April 2020, developer Ubisoft San Francisco announced DLC for the original Rocksmith had come to an end, with the team moving on to a new project. Perhaps Rocksmith+ is it.

                    <span>Ubisoft has suffered another leak for one of its games, this time DLC for the upcoming Far Cry 6.
A video advert was spotted by fans playing on YouTube, and although Ubisoft has issued copyright claims in a bid to scrub the leak from the internet, it&#x27;s readily available.
According to the advert, the Far Cry 6 season pass lets you play as villains from previous Far Cry games. Vaas from Far Cry 3 is shown, as is Pagan from Far Cry 4 and Joseph from Far Cry 5.

                    <span>Back 4 Blood looks set for Xbox Game Pass day one.
Redditor JohnTLH spotted the news in the YouTube description for the upcoming Back 4 Blood PvP video reveal, which is set for 10pm UK time on Sunday 13th June.
That reveal follows Microsoft&#x27;s E3 press conference, which kicks off at 6pm the same day. I suspect the announcement will be made - officially! - during Microsoft&#x27;s press conference.

                    <span>PlayStation boss Jim Ryan has insisted he doesn&#x27;t hate old games while responding to controversial comments he made in 2017, and explained the PS5&#x27;s lack of support for PlayStation&#x27;s entire back catalogue of games.
Speaking in the latest Axios Gaming newsletter, Ryan was asked about a 2017 interview with Time in which he recalled seeing different versions of Gran Turismo running side-by-side on PSone, PS2, PS3 and PS4.
&quot;The PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?&quot; he said at the time.

As part of its Geeked Week of reveals, Netflix teased a first look at things to come, and it&#x27;s delivered exactly that - albeit limiting itself to just 12 seconds of footage.
Even before the conclusion of The Witcher&#x27;s well-received first season, Netflix confirmed an eventual return for Geralt, Jennefer, Ciri, and Jaskier (as played by Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan, and Joey Batey respectively).
Since then, we&#x27;ve learned that the second season - which promises to dial back on the time-hopping antics of its predecessor - will usher in new cast members including Simon Callow as the Dorian detective Codringher, Silent Witness&#x27; Liz Carr as business partner Fenn, Bridgerton&#x27;s Adjoa Andoh as priestess Nenneke, and Brave New World&#x27;s Cassie Clare as Phillippa Eilhart, sorceress and advisor to King Vizimir.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s animated adaptation of legendary video game series Castlevania is now at the end of its acclaimed four-season run, and fans have been wondering what comes next. Today brings answer: more Castlevania, but different.
Castlevania&#x27;s future on Netflix was left in doubt when the streaming service opted to wind up the series in its current guise after showrunner Warren Ellis departed from the show following allegations of sexual misconduct. However, subsequent rumours suggested a spin-off was in the works, and Netflix has now made that official.
With Castlevania&#x27;s current run now concluded, Netflix is working on a brand-new series that will take Richter Belmont (son of original series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - both familiar characters to game fans - to 1792 France for an adventure that unfolds against the backdrop of the French Revolution.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s apparent mission to give every single video game in the universe the TV show treatment is continuing with three newly announced animated adaptations of Ubisoft properties: Splinter Cell, Far Cry, and unforgettable Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon.
A Splinter Cell animated adaptation was first rumoured last July, but Ubisoft and Netflix have now made the show official. It&#x27;ll follows the adventures of iconic video game series protagonist Sam Fisher after he&#x27;s recruited to work for the NSA&#x27;s mysterious Echelon Division.
Expect black ops missions, stealth, and military tactics in a series that&#x27;s being written by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad. That&#x27;s pretty much all Netflix has shared right now, other than this appropriately shadowy glimpse of Sam as he&#x27;ll appear in the show:

                    <span>Netflix has a lot of video game adaptations in the works at the moment, and we&#x27;ll be seeing the fruits of those ongoing labours later today as its Geeked Week of reveals concludes. It promises to be a busy one - debuting footage from the likes of The Witcher Season 2 and Cuphead - but first there are the opening three minutes of the streaming service&#x27;s CGI Resident Evil series ahead of its release in July. 
Known as Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, this animated adaption takes place several years after the events of Resident Evil 4, with Leon S. Kennedy once again serving as the US president&#x27;s bodyguard - which would probably seem like a walk in the park compared to his usual adventures if it wasn&#x27;t for the threat of an imminent zombie outbreak.
Claire Redfield also plays a role in Leon&#x27;s latest adventure, embarking on her own investigation as (the supposedly canon) events unfold, and if you&#x27;re curious to see how proceedings kick off, you can do that via the first three minutes of the show below.

Today, EA said Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has seen more than 20 million players worldwide since it launched in November 2019. That&#x27;ll be why it&#x27;s getting a sequel then!

                    <span>Amazon is bringing Lost Ark to North America and Europe this autumn.

Lost Ark is already out in Korea, Japan and Russia, and has more than eight million concurrent players, Amazon said. It&#x27;s developed by South Korean studio Smilegate RPG, whose parent company developed the phenomenally popular first-person shooter Crossfire.

                    <span>Guilty Gear Strive PC gamers should not play in 4K, the developer has warned.
Arc System Works issued the warning in a post on Strive&#x27;s Steam page just a few hours before the game went live on PC.
The fighting game does support 4K resolutions, but is currently experiencing severe slowdowns during specific situations in battle, such as when counter-hitting, Arc System Works said.

                    <span>Some Nintendo Switch users who installed the system&#x27;s latest firmware update have reported issues downloading purchased games from their store history.
The issue shows up as error code 2123-1502, for which there are steps on Nintendo&#x27;s customer support site. But fans affected by the problem say these do not fix the bug in most cases.
A spate of reports flagging up this error code erupted this week when Nintendo released a small and otherwise unimportant system update.
