                              <span>As Netflix&#x27;s gaming strategy grows ever bolder following its first tentative steps into the market, the streaming service has now revealed it&#x27;s &quot;seriously exploring&quot; its own cloud gaming offering.


That&#x27;s according to Netflix&#x27;s vice president of gaming Mike Verdu, who, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt (thanks TechCrunch), explained the company saw the technology as &quot;a value add&quot; for subscribers. &quot;We&#x27;re not asking you to subscribe as a console replacement. It&#x27;s a completely different business model. The hope is over time that it just becomes this very natural way to play games where wherever you are.&quot;


Addressing the elephant in the room - the dramatic failure of Google&#x27;s game streaming service Stadia, which will cease operations in January, a little over three years after its initial launch - Verdu noted that while Stadia was a &quot;technical success&quot; and was &quot;fun to play games on&quot;, &quot;it had some issues with the business model.&quot;

Perhaps, first, a quick introduction for those who&#x27;ve yet to experienced the marvels of Guildford High Street for themselves; it&#x27;s the epicentre of a small town situated around 40 miles south-west of London that just so happens to be a thriving hub for the UK&#x27;s game development scene.


Poke around and you&#x27;ll find the likes of Supermassive, Media Molecule, EA, Room developer Fireproof Games, Criterion, Ubisoft - and, of course, No Man&#x27;s Sky developer Hello Games.

                              <span>New reports have emerged disputing claims made by original Bayonetta voice actor Hellena Taylor that developer PlatinumGames was only willing to offer her a total of $4000 USD to reprise her role in the series&#x27; upcoming third instalment.


Taylor - who has been replaced by voice actor Jennifer Hale for Bayonetta 3 - made the claim in a series of emotional videos shared on Twitter this weekend, citing Platinum&#x27;s &quot;insulting [pay] offer&quot; as the reason for her absence in the third game.


&quot;I didn&#x27;t want the world, I didn&#x27;t ask for too much,&quot; she said in one video. &quot;I was just asking for a decent, dignified living wage. What they did was legal, but it was immoral.&quot; Taylor also called for a boycott of Bayonetta 3, suggesting fans instead donated their money to charity.

                              <span>As part of its first ever Behind the Sims Summit Stream event, EA has given a &quot;super early&quot; look at its next Sims game, codenamed Project Rene, as well as offered a few teases of its future plans for The Sims 4.


Project Rene - a name EA says it chose to reflect words like &quot;renewal, renaissance, rebirth&quot; - is described as a &quot;next generation Sims game and creative platform&quot; that will &quot;[reimagine] the Sims you know and love with new ways to play&quot;.


It&#x27;s said to be built on a foundation of &quot;charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories&quot; that will stay true to previous Sims games while also &quot;pushing to evolve how those Sims think and behave, [pushing] tools even further when creating and customising, and [exploring] innovative ways to not only tell stories but to collaborate on those stories or creations with your closest friends across your favourite devices.&quot;

                              <span>With Need for Speed Unbound now officially revealed and hurtling toward its 2nd December release, EA is continuing to rev the hype engines with a brand-new trailer, this one showing off what the publisher is calling its &#x27;risk and reward&#x27; gameplay.


What that actually means in practice isn&#x27;t immediately clear from the trailer&#x27;s rapid cuts and overbearing stylings, but EA sheds more light on the matter in an accompanying press release.


&quot;In Need for Speed Unbound,&quot; it explains, &quot;players have to take risks to get to the top. Choose how and when to put it all on the line, pulling huge drifts on the street, outdriving the cops, or placing side bets with their own earnings against rival racers.&quot;

Developed by NetherRealm Studios and known as Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, this game will make its debut in 2023 and provide users with their first &quot;mobile-exclusive cinematic story experience&quot; for the series. 


On its release next year, players will be tasked with building up their team of fighters (of which there will be a &quot;vast roster&quot; of characters to pick from) in a bid to stop a &quot;dark and dangerous threat from wreaking havoc across the realms.&quot; This will all be done via real-time group battles.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&#x27;s iconic Kokiri Forest has been recreated in Halo Infinite&#x27;s Forge mode.


YouTuber Red Nomster is known for creating Forge maps, but this might just be their best yet (as spotted by GamesRadar).


All the obvious features are included, from Link&#x27;s house, to the item shop and the layout of tree houses and walkways.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption has left PlayStation&#x27;s streaming service after six years of availability. 


Sony&#x27;s service - now part of the newly-revamped PS Plus Premium, though formerly the separate PlayStation Now subscription - has been home to Red Dead Redemption since 2016.


Its departure means there is now no way to play Rockstar&#x27;s original cowboy epic on PS4 or PS5.

                              <span>Bethesda could be bringing back its most infamous Elder Scrolls NPC in its forthcoming sci-fi RPG Starfield.


In a recent Q&amp;A with director Todd Howard, details were given on the game&#x27;s trait system. Each trait comes with positives and negatives, as well as an accompanying side quest to remove them.



As PCGamesN spotted, one of these traits is called &quot;Hero Worshipped&quot; in which the player has &quot;earned the attention of an annoying &#x27;Adoring Fan&#x27; who will show up randomly and jabber at you incessantly. On the plus side, he&#x27;ll give you gifts...&quot;  See for yourself in the below video at the 3:17 mark.

The usual array of in-game quests will offer a smattering of free cosmetics, but you&#x27;ll need to cough up in the game&#x27;s item shop to buy the Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, plus both Meeseeks and Queen Summer from Rick &amp; Morty.

                              <span>EA has updated its Online Service Shutdown page, detailing several of its titles losing online features in the near future. 


On 9th November, both Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars for Xbox 360 (including its Kane&#x27;s Wrath expansion) will see their online services shut  down. 
Red Alert 3, as I am sure you are all aware, is most famous for Tim Curry&#x27;s exuberant proclamation that he&#x27;s headed to space as it is the one place not corrupted by capitalism. That&#x27;s always a fun clip to replay.

Capcom has stated it&#x27;s now working on a fix.

Coder Ryan Dwyer is behind this, working on both the launch NTSC version and a later re-release that fixed various bugs (thanks VGC).


We can now expect PC players to have plenty of fun improving the visuals of the game, or simply messing around with Joanna Dark, Elvis the alien and more.

Everyone travelling to Qatar during the football World Cup will be asked to download two apps called Ehteraz and Hayya.
Briefly, Ehteraz is an covid-19 tracking app, while Hayya is an official World Cup app used to keep track of match tickets and to access the free Metro in Qatar.
In particular, the covid-19 app Ehteraz asks for access to several rights on your mobile., like access to read, delete or change all content on the phone, as well as access to connect to WiFi and Bluetooth, override other apps and prevent the phone from switching off to sleep mode...</span>

                              <span>Capcom has revealed it&#x27;ll be airing the latest instalment of its occasional Resident Evil showcase series this Thursday, 20th October, with perhaps the most exciting promise being more news on its forthcoming Resident Evil 4 remake.


As detailed on Twitter, the publisher will be broadcasting its latest Resident Evil showcase via Twitch this Thursday, with proceedings set to get underway at 11pm UK time - which, if you&#x27;re watching from the US, equates to 3pm PDT and 6pm EDT.


Capcom hasn&#x27;t shared much in the way of specifics, only saying it&#x27;ll be detailing the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition - which arrives on 12th December, bundling together the base game and upcoming Winters Expansion DLC  - as well as its Resident Evil 4 remake, and &quot;more&quot;.

                              <span>In the not entirely unlikely event you&#x27;ve been clamouring for a bit more jazz in your Elden Ring soundtrack, Bandai Namco has the answer. It&#x27;s announced it&#x27;ll be hosting a live concert this December that, for those in the US willing to pay for it, will be streamed online.


Elden Ring: A Night in the Lands Between, as the event will be known, is a collaboration between Bandai Namco, award-winning musician Kenny Garrett, and Takuya Kuroda. It promises &quot;recognisable melodies from the game&#x27;s soundtrack... performed live in Jazz format - with improvisation&quot; by a group of musicians lead by Garrett on alto sax and Kuroda on trumpet.


&quot;While video game soundtracks have seen variations as symphonic music and even Rock n&#x27; Roll, our &#x27;A Night in the Lands Between&#x27; Jazz event is exploring a wonderfully different treatment of the Elden Ring soundtrack&quot;, wrote Bandai Namco&#x27;s senior director of esports and live entertainment Wataru Nakasuji in a statement accompanying today&#x27;s announcement.

Details of the new season, which Respawn is calling Eclipse, are a little light at present, but the developer&#x27;s newly launched Season 15 webpage promises a new map - said to be lie &quot;in Boreas&#x27; shadow&quot; - as well as a new gifting feature, enabling players to purchase and send cosmetic items to their friends.


For now, though, the focus is very much on new hero Catalyst, real name Tressa Smith, described as a &quot;experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer  [who] uses her remarkable control of ferrofluid to manipulate the battlefield.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has announced it&#x27;ll be bringing its Switch Sports servers back online tomorrow, 18th October, with players affected by the recent downtime getting an extra week added to their Nintendo Switch Online membership.


Switch Sports&#x27; servers were taking offline and save data backups were suspended on Friday, while Nintendo investigated a significant bug introduced in last week&#x27;s 1.2.1 update that caused crashes on the game&#x27;s pre-match loading screen, during both online and offline play.


Servers and save data backup functionality have remained unavailable since then, but Nintendo Japan has now offered an update on its website (thanks VGC), confirming the crashing was caused by a save writing error under certain conditions and revealing it&#x27;ll be restoring all functionality across two waves later this week.

Back in August, Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions accused publisher PQube of misusing money gained from a diversity fund. Toge claimed this money was intended to finance its next game A Space For The Unbound.



&quot;The diversity fund was a grant fund intended to help underrepresented game developers, especially during the pandemic,&quot; Toge Productions wrote at the time. &quot;However, instead of giving those funds to the developers as the grant was intended, PQube Games intentionally withheld information about the grant and used it as a leverage for their own commercial gain.

Each item in this collection has been influenced by the game, with elements such as Forbidden West&#x27;s key art and homages to Aloy&#x27;s in-game looks included throughout each piece.

                              <span>Pokémon Go has launched a new kind of raid activity - Elite Raids - designed to test players&#x27; mettle in return for ultra-rare creatures.


Beyond being a test for players with a buffed-up Pokémon team, Elite Raids also seem like Pokémon Go developer Niantic&#x27;s latest nudge to get users back outside in big numbers, generating the kind of crowds you might see playing pre-pandemic.


The first evidence of Elite Raids began popping up in-game on Friday, with an extended 24-hour countdown clock on some Pokémon gyms and a flashy new raid egg on the game&#x27;s map. A message stated these raids would require players to take part in-person at the raid site itself, rather than using a Remote Raid Pass to join from the sofa.

That includes adjusting the volume of various sound effects and adding a &quot;distance to opponent&quot; sound.

The incident occurred at a Gladiators-style foam pit stand sponsored by Lenovo, where Chechik jumped into the pit and was left severely injured. Several others were also injured.


Chechik has been sharing updates on her recovery on social media, confirming she had a second round of surgery on 14th October - almost a week after the incident.

But in a change to tradition, we didn&#x27;t get a title for the update or its full list of additions - in response to the fact Mojang has  struggled in the past to deliver everything it has previously promised. 


For now, Minecraft&#x27;s 2023 update is being referred to as &quot;Minecraft 1.20&quot;, and is confirmed to feature camels, hanging signs, chiseled bookshelves and bamboo crafting - including the ability to build a bamboo raft. Camels look a particularly interesting addition - as they can jump fair distances and fit two players riding on top.

                              <span>Gotham Knights will be limited to 30FPS and not include a performance mode for consoles on its release later this month. 


This news was confirmed by Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer Fleur Marty via Discord. Here, Marty explained this was &quot;due to the types of features&quot; included in the game, adding the additional option of a performance mode would not have been &quot;as straightforward as lowering the resolution and getting a higher FPS&quot;.


Marty highlighted the game&#x27;s &quot;highly detailed&quot; open-world setting and its untethered co-op gameplay as two of the reasons the upcoming game does not &quot;have a performance/quality toggle option&quot;. She concluded by confirming Gotham Knights will run at 30FPS on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 (the developer previously confirmed it had canned the planned PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game).

                              <span>Konami horror project P.T. has been made playable on a PlayStation 5, via a hacked PS4 emulator.


Streamer and dataminer Lance McDonald has managed to get the game working on a non-jailbroken PS5 console.


Essentially, a legitimate copy of P.T. is required as well as an active PSN account on both a jailbroken PS5 and a normal, fully updated PS5. The emulator is then transferred from one to the other.

                              <span>Hellena Taylor, the original voice actress behind Bayonetta, has requested fans boycott the third game following an &quot;insulting&quot; salary offer.
Taylor, who voiced the character in the first two games, has been succeeded by Jennifer Hale for the third game for unknown reasons, until now.
In a series of emotional videos on Twitter, Taylor explains she was offered just $4000 as a flat rate to work on Bayonetta 3, despite her previous work and years of training.

                              <span>Developer Media Molecule&#x27;s impressively flexible PlayStation creation tool Dreams is celebrating Halloween this year with the return of its annual All Hallows&#x27; event, this time beckoning players to take a spooky trip to the Land of Lost Dreams.


This latest journey to the realms of spookidom is the third Halloween event for Dreams, following previous outings that saw Media Molecule collaborating with its community to create explorable haunted houses and then, last year, a creepy old fairground.


Things are getting a little more fantastical this time around, however, with a quest to the far-flung Land of Lost Dreams, where players can embark on a quest full of odd characters and puzzles as they attempt to uncover a &quot;rich and unnerving history&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo has taken its Switch Sports servers offline - and suspended save data backups - while it investigates an issue causing crashes in the game&#x27;s latest update.


Switch Sports&#x27; version 1.2.1 update launched earlier this week, aiming to further strengthen measures against what Nintendo called &quot;disruptive behaviours&quot; online, as well as pledging to suspend any online players violating its Community Guidelines. Punishable actions included &quot;fraudulent behaviour such as save data manipulation.&quot;


Unfortunately, patch 1.2.1 also introduced a significant bug causing crashes - whether playing online or offline - during the pre-match loading screen.

                              <span>OlliOlli World is poised to receive its second and final expansion on 2nd November - and developer Roll7 has offered a closer look at its skybound skating hijinks ahead of its arrival.


Finding The Flowzone, as the new expansion is known, takes OlliOlli World&#x27;s acclaimed skating action high above Radlandia, with players roaming the clouds in a fantastical floating boat alongside the infamous Radmospheric Three - &quot;grizzled sea-dog Captain Squid, the prim and proper Professor Planks, and the mystically inclined Christopher Licht&quot;. 


Ultimately, the goal is to reach the fabled city of Radlantis, meet the legendary Gail Force, and compete before the Skate Godz to earn the Radlantis Rivals Cup. First, though, players must complete courses set among the clouds, with some familiar Radlandia sights providing the backdrop.

                              <span>&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it&#x27;s not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we&#x27;re pressing the &#x27;unlaunch&#x27; button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th,&quot; says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases.
Unveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC&#x27;s 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it&#x27;s fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.
The table below reveals that the spec differential wasn&#x27;t just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.

                              <span>EA Motive has been uncommonly talkative throughout the development of its Dead Space remake, with the studio hosting various livestreams to show off the likes of its improved art, audio, and gameplay changes - but now, with the game&#x27;s 27th January launch inching ever nearer, we&#x27;ve had our clearest look yet at how all those elements will come together, courtesy of a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough.


Hot on the heels of last week&#x27;s 2-minute gameplay trailer, EA celebrated Dead Space&#x27;s 14th anniversary today with an extended sequence from the remake&#x27;s third chapter, in which protagonist Isaac must explore the infested USG Ishimura in order to reach the ship&#x27;s engineering deck take and repair its engines.


The sequence began in Ishimura&#x27;s hanger - an area that&#x27;s now much bigger than it was in the original (a side-by-side comparison made the differences abundantly clear) - with players now able to zero-g their way around the area. Some of remake&#x27;s environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.

                              <span>Pokémon Go&#x27;s annual Halloween event is often one of its best activities and, as expected, this year features a number of new bits and pieces in-game. The event&#x27;s first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. 


 These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.


Niantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure.

                              <span>After eight years, the Destiny franchise is moving on from its various destination materials - the Spinmetal, Helium Filaments and Relic Iron you could zoom around on your Sparrow vehicle and harvest while patrolling the series&#x27; many planets and moons.


Some of my earliest memories from Destiny 1 are of looping the Cosmodrome for Spinmetal Leaves, hopping off my Sparrow to gather them, then heading off to the next node. Levelling your gear - which in turn levels your character - required plugging bits of these resources in, and I don&#x27;t want to think about the number of hours I spent grinding these out.


Now, or rather as of Destiny 2&#x27;s upcoming Season 19, the materials themselves will no longer be available to acquire - although you can still go zooming around on your Sparrow if you want to.

                              <span>Today brings another new Pokémon set to debut in the upcoming Scarlet and Violet games for Nintendo Switch:  Bellibolt, an electric-type frog.

A couple of days ago, a teaser was released where Iono, a new gym leader character described as an influencer and livestreamer within the Pokémon universe, asked viewers to guess what her partner Pokémon was.

We were given the following clues: appearance-wise it&#x27;s squishy, sluggish with an easygoing vibe, and has &quot;two big ol&#x27; bumps on its noggin that people always mistake for eyes&quot;. And it&#x27;s &quot;so cute&quot;, according to Iono.

The project is being lead by Dominic Guay, a 20-year veteran of Ubisoft who worked on Splinter Cell before rising to become senior producer of Watch Dogs and its sequel.


Invoke owner and D&amp;D publisher Wizards of the Coast announced the new project this week with only a few details: that it will have a triple-A scope, and be developed on the Unreal 5 engine.

In its latest developer blog post, Blizzard detailed its &quot;current thinking on hero balance and gameplay&quot;, including map rotation and player ranking.


&quot;While some heroes are performing better than others, and there are differences across player skill levels, we have been happy to see that no hero&#x27;s overall power level is far out of line with our goals,&quot; Blizzard said.

Baby Shark, the children&#x27;s song that went viral a few years ago thanks to South Korean educational entertainment company Pinkfong, is getting an &quot;open-world adaptation&quot;.

The game will be a collaboration between Baby Shark Games, a subsidiary of Pinkfong, and Retro Future, a developer who specialises in pixel games.

As shared via Nintendo of America&#x27;s own Twitter, this latest foray into the world of Mario inspired timepieces introduces us to two new watches. 


The first is the standard Chronograph, which is limited to 3000 pieces. This watch features several Mario Kart references across its face, including icons of Power Stars and the like where you would usually see the date showing up. Meanwhile, the Mario Kart logo can be seen etched on the back.

What&#x27;s more, references have been found to two new maps that don&#x27;t yet exist in the game.

In a new blog post, Activision confirmed it would require a text-enabled mobile phone number to play the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on PC, and also Warzone 2.0.


This will not apply on console, however, or to anyone on PC who verified their account to play the existing Warzone previously.

                              <span>Details about the story of the upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie are still being kept hush-hush, but we&#x27;re learning more as we move closer to its release next year.

And, we know now that Toad will have a small musical number in the film, revealed by Keegan-Michael Key.

Key, who studied theatre at university, has sung on-screen previously in the TV series Schmigadoon! and Netflix&#x27;s Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey.

Now we know more about how this monstrous humanoid came to be, at least in terms of his conception - and it turns out he was inspired by background characters from the 1995 film Braveheart.


Sharing this titbit on Twitter, Silent Hill 2 director Masahiro Ito revealed the film&#x27;s executioners that pop up when Mel Gibson&#x27;s William Wallace is being hung, drawn and quartered, were the &quot;inspiration for the background of Pyramid Head from [Silent Hill 2]&quot;.

Earlier in the week, Rising Hope&#x27;s all-female Valorant team and head coach Jehiel quit after a sexual harassment claim was raised regarding another coach, named Simons.


In a Twitlonger statement, Jehiel detailed how Simons would regularly threaten to reveal his genitals despite frequent requests not to.

The game&#x27;s developer Asobo has now warned those with early copies not to ruin Requiem&#x27;s story - posting a picture of a knight being consumed by thousands of plague rats as a warning of what will happen should you spoil things for others.


Digital copies of the game will unlock at midnight local time next Tuesday, 18th October, but it appears some early physical copies have been sent out early. Eurogamer has spotted some big spoilers doing the rounds - so be careful where you click if you want to go in blind.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re back discussing Microsoft&#x27;s big Activision Blizzard deal and the latest developments in the ongoing saga of the $68bn buyout being finalised.

Yesterday, Microsoft leapt upon the latest concerned update from the UK&#x27;s deal regulator and repeatedly tried to minimise its own importance in the video games market. Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation&#x27;s userbase would be &quot;significantly larger&quot; than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony&#x27;s own complaints about the deal at face value. 

Is this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead.

Americans are now forbidden from using it. According to the US government, Tornado Cash was sanctioned because it allegedly laundered over $7 billion in cryptocurrency, $455 million of which was stolen by a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.
Tornado Cash is not a traditional company run by human beings, but instead a series of “smart contracts”: self-executing code that exists only as software. ...</span>

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence, the new narrative adventure from developer Dramatic Labs, will no longer release this year as originally planned and is now expected to arrive on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation in April 2023.


Resurgence, which was announced at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, takes place after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, telling its story from the alternating perspectives of two different characters - First Officer Jara Rydek and Engineering Crewperson Carter Diaz - with gameplay said to consist of playable cinematic sequences.


Everything shown so far points to an experience very much in the same vein as the interactive narrative adventures pioneered by Telltale Games - which isn&#x27;t particularly surprising given that Dramatic Labs was founded by controversial former Telltale Games boss Kevin Bruner, and includes around 20 former Telltale employees.

Aurora - who performed the haunting vocal accompaniment to Idina Menzel in Frozen 2&#x27;s showstopper Into the Unknown, and whose singles include Cure for Me and Runaway - has been heard in Sky before, but she&#x27;ll play a much greater role in its latest season of content.


Appropriately titled Season of Aurora, this will feature a &quot;story told in music&quot; where players can explore the &quot;song-filled memories of Spirits who carried hope through struggle and loss&quot;.

                              <span>If you can somehow still look at your gaming backlog without being consumed by existential dread, here&#x27;s another two additions for your infinitely expanding pile: Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition and Evoland Legendary Edition, both free next week on the Epic Games Store.


Fallout 3 likely needs no introduction, given its lofty place in the gaming pantheon. Released back in 2008, it was Bethesda&#x27;s first foray into the Fallout universe (1 and 2 were the work of Black Isle Studios), expanding on the open-world RPG freedom of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion to deliver a sprawling, dizzyingly rich post-apocalyptic jaunt through The Capital Wasteland.


An &quot;embarrassment of riches&quot; is what Eurogamer called Fallout 3 in 2008, describing it as a &quot;thrilling, all-consuming experience that will absorb you for weeks... as you fall in love with the relentless excitement, incredible atmosphere, sense of place and sheer choice.&quot; The Game of the Year Edition being given away on Epic includes the base game and all its DLC.

                              <span>Developer Insomniac Games&#x27; formerly PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be coming to PC on 18th November - and ahead of its release, Sony has detailed the PC port&#x27;s system-specific features and requirements.


In case it somehow wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the Miles-Morales-starring follow-up to Insomniac&#x27;s original Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, taking the first game&#x27;s acclaimed web-swinging open-world action and infusing it with a new hero and a bit of snowy, seasonal jollity thanks to its year-end setting.


&quot;Insomniac&#x27;s second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original,&quot; said Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robinson in his Recommended review, &quot;but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too.&quot;

                              <span>The growing popularity of digital purchases has had the unintended effect of breaking down regional pricing barriers designed to keep games affordable all over the world. 


This is due to &quot;region-hopping&quot; - a tactic used by those seeking to take advantage of lower prices in other countries, as publishers adjust the price of games in each region based on median incomes. 


The trouble with this is it means customers from richer economies can also loophole themselves into grabbing a game for significantly cheaper than their own local pricing.

                              <span>Xbox is expanding its Microsoft Gaming Accessibility Testing Service (MGATS) to allow for detailed feedback from disabled players.


The service launched back in February 2021 for games to be validated against the Xbox accessibility guidelines and accessibility tags applied. Now, developers can gain feedback from disabled players testing their games.


Microsoft announced this news at today&#x27;s Xbox Accessibility Showcase, celebrating the disability community and those making gaming more accessible.

                              <span>Former Nintendo game tester Mackenzie Clifton, who claimed they were fired after asking about unionisation, has agreed to accept a settlement of $25,910 (around £23k) in pay, interest and damages. 


This agreement with the US National Labor Relations Board concludes Clifton&#x27;s long-running dispute with Nintendo and its contractor agency Aston Carter, through which they were employed to test Nintendo games. 


As part of the deal, Nintendo must also display a notice informing employees (in block capital letters) they &quot;WILL NOT&quot; be fired or stopped from discussing unionisation.

                              <span>Bart and Milhouse often have a rough time of it throughout The Simpsons&#x27; many episodes and seasons. The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. 
However, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as &quot;The Springfield Files.&quot;

This episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer&#x27;s conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner&#x27;s Waterworld.

Walther is widely known for their detailed and excellent Bloodborne PSX demake, and has been working on the racing project since March.

Their latest update shows off Gehrman, the elderly gentleman who hangs around the workshop inside the Hunter&#x27;s Dream, though I suspect he&#x27;s been modding his ride a bit.

Sure, you could use the built-in app on your Smart TV, or switchover to your Chromecast, but that&#x27;s a lot of effort.

Now he&#x27;ll appear in character as Black Adam, to tie in with his appearance in the film of the same name, which is set to launch in cinemas next week.

                              <span>Last month Google Stadia officially announced it will shut down its beleaguered cloud gaming service for good in January next year.


Now, in light of this news, the developer behind top-down party battle game and Google Stadia exclusive Outcasters has informed its players that, at this point in time, it &quot;does not have plans to bring [the game] to other platforms&quot;.


In a statement on Twitter, British developer Splash Damage explained that as Outcasters was both designed and built with Stadia specifically in mind, the game&#x27;s systems were &quot;heavily reliant on the platform&quot; and the work required to release it on a different platform was simply too complex at this time.

                              <span>Another sexual harassment lawsuit has been filed against Activision Blizzard.


This latest complaint, filed in Los Angeles by a former employee of the company referred to as Jane Doe, targets both the Call of Duty maker itself and the employee&#x27;s former manager, Miguel Vega. 

Doe is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against the company and her ex-manager. In addition to this, Doe has demanded the removal of Bobby Kotick as CEO, as part of the lawsuit.

                              <span>Esports will not feature in the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which are due to be held in Victoria, Australia. 


The surprising U-turn comes after esports were piloted at the 2022 Games held in Birmingham. 


The pilot was co-funded by the Commonwealth Games Federation (GF) and the Global Esports Federation (GEF). At the time, the CGF called the pilot a success and expected esports to be held at future Games.

Scientists at Australian company Cortical Labs, which which conducts research into the use of biology in AI, reported their findings yesterday in Neuron, a peer-reviewed neuroscience journal.

Their paper, titled &quot;In vitro neurons learn and exhibit sentience when embodied in a simulated game-world&quot;, claimed the cultivated brain showed &quot;apparent learning  within five minutes of real-time gameplay&quot;.

                              <span>A fresh patch is now available for Elden Ring that adds separate damage scaling for PvP.


That means balance adjustments when playing against others online, such as increased stamina attack power and a decrease in the power of Ashes of War.


These adjustments do not affect single-player or cooperative play.

                              <span>Sony has now sold 2m units of its PlayStation 5 console in the UK, despite a recent price hike.


It took 98 weeks to reach this number, in-line with sales of the PS3 and making it the joint fourth fastest-selling console in the UK.


Since launch, the console has been hampered with stock shortage issues and remains in high demand. That&#x27;s despite a price increase for UK consumers of £30 back in August, which Sony blamed on inflation.

The mode was not due to be released until later this year, ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar which begins in  November. 


FIFA 23 owners on PlayStation 5 have posted screenshots of the mode on social media, which show four different sub-modes: FIFA World Cup Live, FIFA World Cup Kick-Off, Online Tournament and FIFA World Cup 2022.

                              <span>Sony may have accidentally revealed that PlayStation classic Ridge Racer 2 is on its way to PS Plus.


Yesterday, Sony announced the next slate of games coming to the subscription service in October, including Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Dragon Quest 11, and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.


PlayStation Access, the official PlayStation YouTube channel, included Ridge Racer 2 in its list of classic games, but this was not included in the PlayStation Blog. The PlayStation Access video has since been updated (thanks VGC).

                              <span>EA has triumphantly termed the recently-released FIFA 23 as &quot;record-breaking&quot; - for hitting 10.3 million players in its first week, and having the &quot;biggest launch period in EA Sports FIFA franchise history&quot;.


FIFA 23 is, of course, also the last EA Sports FIFA franchise release in history - with the series set to transition to EA Sports FC from next year. 


Signs were good that FIFA 23 had performed well at launch this year. Launched on 30th September, the game&#x27;s first week of UK boxed game sales slightly beat those of FIFA 22 - despite the overall trend of declining physical game sales in favour of digital.

                              <span>With Starfield&#x27;s hugely anticipated 2023 release growing ever-closer, Bethesda has launched a new Q&amp;A video series, and episode one sees director Todd Howard responding to a number of community queries - including sharing some thoughts on traits, dialogue, and whether Starfield can be described as a &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; game.


Howard began the chat by detailing a few of Starfield&#x27;s inspirations - 1984 space sim SunDog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller, if you&#x27;re wondering - before moving on to tackle the &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; question. This, he said, was a little tricky to answer insofar as different people will likely have different definitions of &quot;hard sci-fi&quot;, but for Bethesda, &quot;It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here&#x27;s how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that&quot;.


However, he also called the question a bit of a trap, &quot;because it&#x27;s a video game. Like, a hard science-fiction video game would be, you die in space cold.&quot;

                              <span>Valve has finally revamped its decidedly decrepit Steam mobile app for iOS and Android, introducing a fresh look, a new interface, and a range of new features.


The original version of Valve&#x27;s Steam mobile app launched over a decade ago, and it&#x27;s felt exceedingly outdated for a very long time. As of today, though, iOS and Android users can download a completely refreshed version via their device&#x27;s respective app stores.


It&#x27;s most immediately obvious change is a considerably more streamlined interface - which gives quick access to the store, personalised news, Steam Guard, and notifications, as well as unburying the likes of wish lists and other key features - but there&#x27;s plenty more besides.

                              <span>Torchlight: Infinite - a free-to-play reimagining of the dungeon-crawling action-RPG series - has just launched its open beta on Android and iOS devices, as well as PC.


Torchlight, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was originally the work of now-defunct developer Runic Games, which made two games in the series before its closure in 2017 - the sequel delivering a critically acclaimed chunk of captivating dungeon-crawling and class-based hack-and-slash action. 


Having disbanded Runic, publisher Perfect World then revived the series just nine months later, handing the reins to developer Echtra Games for 2020&#x27;s Torchlight 3. Interestingly, this third outing was initially planned to be free-to-play title before Perfect World eventually capitulated after a bit of an outcry - but now, following Torchlight 3&#x27;s less-than-stellar reception, those free-to-play plans are back for Torchlight: Infinite.

                              <span>FIFA has launched its first video game venture since its split with EA - a vaguely football-themed Roblox &quot;immersive experience&quot; intended to tie-in with this year&#x27;s Qatar world cup.


Following the termination of FIFA&#x27;s partnership with EA earlier this year - which will result in the latter&#x27;s long-running football series being rebranded as EA Sports FC from 2023 - FIFA president Gianni Infantino insisted, &quot;I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans.&quot;


To that end, it said it had already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024, but would first be launching a number of &quot;non-simulation games&quot; toward the end of this year.

The headline addition is Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the definitive edition version previously remastered for PS4 and PS5. 


But Dragon Quest fans will be happy with five games from the series added to PS Plus: Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age, Dragon Quest Builders and its sequel, Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree&#x27;s Woe and the Blight Below, and Dragon Quest Heroes 2: Explorer&#x27;s Edition.

&quot;Let&#x27;s try that again,&quot; Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra wrote on Twitter last night, sharing a fresh blog post from the developer which apologises - yet again - for the game&#x27;s troubled arrival and offers a few bits and pieces to cheer fans up.


Overwatch 2 players can look forward to &quot;several Double Match XP weekends&quot; - dates for which will be announced soon. Anyone who logs in this season from 25th October onwards will also get a Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary skin and a Health Pack Weapon Charm, which is nice I guess.

Custom boot videos for the Steam Deck have recently taken off, and Reddit user waylaidwanderer has even gone to the lengths of setting up the website SteamDeckRepo, dedicated to sharing videos for others to use.

Now it looks like Valve is jumping onto the trend, with references to &quot;Steam Deck Startup Movies&quot; found in code for the Points Shop.

                              <span>The pilot episode of a scrapped Kingdom Hearts animated series has been uploaded to YouTube by its proposed director.

The series was set to be directed and developed by Seth Kearsley, whose other credits include Eight Crazy Nights and The Looney Tunes Show.

In 2002, the same year as the release of the original Kingdom Hearts game, Kearsley was hired by Disney TV for the series. Although the pilot tested &quot;exceptionally well&quot;, it was canned due to Square Enix&#x27;s future plans for &quot;many more games&quot; in the series.

In response to continued questions over whether Microsoft owning Call of Duty would unfairly hobble PlayStation, Microsoft claimed that every COD player on PlayStation could move over to Xbox, and Sony&#x27;s playerbase would still remain &quot;significantly larger&quot; than its own. 


Microsoft does not go into detail on its mental arithmetic here, but does note elswhere in its comments that PlayStation currently has a console install base of 150 million, compared to Xbox&#x27;s install base of 63.7 million.

The Cyberpunk 2077 team lifted the lid on this new project earlier today and, while details on this novel (for now at least) are still fairly thin on the ground, we know that it will be called &quot;No Coincidence&quot;. 
Meanwhile, the story will follow a &quot;group of strangers&quot; doing what they can to negotiate the &quot;dangers of Night City&quot;. Something of which, we all know, there are many.

Stripe&#x27;s arrival follows that of fellow Gremlins alum Gizmo. Unlike Gizmo, however, Stripe will wield a chainsaw - you know, for those times when you want to go full Ash Williams. 


Stripe&#x27;s standard look is unlockable with either 2000 Gold, one Character Ticket, or 700 Gleamium. If you fancy something a little bit more Rambo-like, you can unlock his Combat Stripe variant with 800 Gleamium.

The game was first released in November 2021, meaning its shelf life was a little over 12 months.


News of its end was announced on Twitter: &quot;Despite all our efforts to bring you regular updates with fresh and exciting content, we haven&#x27;t been able to deliver the experience that we were hoping to, and that you all deserve, so we have made the extremely tough decision to end service for Final Fantasy 7 The First Soldier.&quot;

                              <span>Facebook parent company Meta has snaffled up several developers, including ReCore maker Armature Studio, to fold into its own Oculus Studios brand. 


Armature will be joined as part of Meta by LocoCycle and &#x27;Splosion Man developer Twisted Pixel Games, as well as Marvel&#x27;s Iron Man VR company Camouflaj. 


Meta made the acquisition announcements last night as part of its Meta Connect event, where it also confirmed a partnership with Xbox Cloud Gaming to see Microsoft&#x27;s game streaming tech arrive on Quest VR headsets.

                              <span>Researchers have used thermal cameras and ML guessing techniques to recover passwords from measuring the residual heat left by fingers on keyboards. From the abstract:
We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</span>

                              <span>Developer Volition has detailed its Saints Row reboot&#x27;s first major update, saying that while it would have &quot;preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions&quot; at this juncture, it will initially be prioritising &quot;improvements over new features&quot;.


Saints Row released to a middling reception in August, with its enjoyable open-world zaniness rather dampened by its considerable number of bugs. It&#x27;s these that Volition hopes to address in its first major post-launch update in November, explaining in a new blog post, &quot;We know there is still work to do to improve your experience in the game.&quot;


&quot;We are supporting Saints Row for the long-term,&quot; it insisted, &quot;and while we&#x27;d have preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions, right now we feel the focus must be on telling you how we&#x27;re going to improve the... experience for all players in 2022 and beyond.&quot;

                              <span>Rather than launching a new Call of Duty title in 2023, Activision is reportedly planning to instead release a premium expansion including new &quot;campaign content&quot; for Modern Warfare 2.


Word of new paid campaign DLC for Modern Warfare 2 was initially shared by Call of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope, who claimed it would arrive in the game&#x27;s second year (ie. 2023) and would be bundled with a 20th anniversary &quot;greatest hits map pack&quot; containing classic maps from the original 2009 Modern Warfare 2, as well as maps from across the series.


Following TheGhostofHope&#x27;s campaign DLC claims, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier stepped in to corroborate the news. &quot;Next year [Activision Blizzard will] be selling new stuff for MW2&quot;, he wrote in a tweet, &quot;an expansion or something like that&quot;. Although Schreier admitted he wasn&#x27;t &quot;sure exactly what it&#x27;ll look like&quot;, he claimed it would have &quot;campaign stuff too&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft and Meta have announced a partnership that will see Xbox Cloud Gaming come to Quest VR headsets at some currently unspecified future point.


Xbox Cloud Gaming gives Game Pass Ultimate subscribers the ability to stream and play a steadily growing number of titles on a range of Android, Apple, and Windows devices, as well as Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox consoles, and eventually, Microsoft&#x27;s dedicated Keystone device. 


And that list, as revealed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during today&#x27;s Meta Connect event, will grow to include Quest VR head sets via the Meta Quest Store.

EA Sports PGA Tour - the publisher&#x27;s first foray into golfing sims since 2015&#x27;s Rory McIlroy PGA Tour - was officially unveiled back in March last year, promising to deliver world famous golf courses and professional golfers as part of a long-term deal with the PGA Tour.


One year-long delay later, EA Sports PGA Tour is shuffling ever-closer to release, and EA&#x27;s first major reveal for the game comes in the form of a 30-second teaser trailer.

                              <span>On 20th October, Phantom Abyss will be rope-swinging its way onto Xbox Game Pass.


Along with this announcement, we also have a nice shiny new trailer from Devolver Digital to mark the occasion. This trailer, which you can see below, shows off some of the extreme temple runs that you as the player will have to navigate.  


This &quot;massive asynchronous multiplayer&quot; will throw players into those temples seen above and task them with retrieving ancient relics from within. There will be hidden traps to account for, and, as with all good temple exploration, there will of course be guardians that will do everything in their power to stop players from reaching their goal.

It&#x27;s all part of the game&#x27;s visual style that marries realistic vehicles with colourful, animated street art.

                              <span>Are standard Xbox controllers a little too ordinary for your tastes? Then perhaps Microsoft&#x27;s has the answer with its newly revealed - and purportedly &quot;surreal&quot; - Lunar Shift special edition affair.


In what way, you might reasonably be wondering,  is the Lunar Shift Special Edition Wireless Controller &quot;surreal&quot;? Is it perhaps formed from the whisper of a backward-speaking entity in a red-curtain-clad room? Does it droop provocatively across surfaces like a slowly melting pocket watch? Does it wear a snazzy top hat and rain in multitudes?


Alas, none of those things; the Lunar Shift&#x27;s big gimmick is that - in a similar colour-changing fashion to last year&#x27;s Aqua Shift controller - it shifts from silver to gold as it catches the light. This, says, Microsoft, gives it a &quot;stylised, smokey atmosphere&quot;.

                              <span>Shipments of PS5 consoles to the US in September had a 400 percent increase year-over-year, according to a financial analyst.

David Gibson, senior analyst at MST Financial, shared a graph on Twitter showing the imports to the US per month from June 2021 onwards, with a huge spike during last month.

Gibson added he believes some of the stock will go towards the launch of God of War Ragnarök, which makes a lot of sense. Ragnarök is the next first-party title for PlayStation, and Sony will be undoubtedly eager to capitalise on its release to bolster sales of the PS5.

                              <span>There have been some rumblings that Sony, along with developer Naughty Dog, decided to release its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for the PlayStation 5 (and eventually PC) to capitalise on the upcoming HBO series inspired by the game.
However, PlayStation head Hermen Hulst has made it known that this is not the case. Well, at least, it is not entirely the case.
Chatting to Axios, Hulst stated that the initial 2013 release of The Last of Us was &quot;a little ahead of its time in terms of its creative vision&quot;. Hulst claimed that the limitations of technology at this time meant that Naughty Dog&#x27;s ideas ultimately had to be dialled back a notch or two.

Now, following the discovery of this jailbreaking exploit, McDonald has been rifling around in the files for both BluePoint&#x27;s Demon&#x27;s Souls remake and those of the elusive Abandoned from developer Blue Box Game Studio.

When having a closer look at those files for Demon&#x27;s Souls, McDonald came across a rather endearing and fun inclusion by developer BluePoint Games. It turns out that there are 3D model files for the one and only &#x27;Ring of the Chieftain&#x27; tucked away in the PS5 remake.

But in order to accomodate her stature, the development team had to make a small compromise on her height.

                              <span>Following Overwatch 2&#x27;s fairly shambolic release that involved targeted DDoS attacks, Blizzard has reported interruptions this week to Battle.net via a further DDOS attack, causing login issues. 


In addition, Overwatch 2&#x27;s character roster has had to be downsized a tad to allow Blizzard to &quot;iron out a few bugs&quot;. Unfortunately for the developer, however, this has created a new bug of its own, resulting in even more characters becoming inaccessible for some Overwatch 2 players.


On the official customer support Twitter account, Blizzard addressed the DDoS attack faced by Battle.net yesterday. This has reportedly now all been dealt with, however it managed to cause widespread issues for players of both Overwatch 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

                              <span>Interesting research: “ImpNet: Imperceptible and blackbox-undetectable backdoors in compiled neural networks, by Tim Clifford, Ilia Shumailov, Yiren Zhao, Ross Anderson, and Robert Mullins:
Abstract: Early backdoor attacks against machine learning set off an arms race in attack and defence development. Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</span>

                              <span>Square Enix Montréal - the developer behind the likes of Hitman Go and Lara Croft Go - has rebranded as Studio Onoma following its acquisition by Embracer Group in May.


Square Enix Montréal was one of three studios purchased by Embracer Group as part of a $300m USD deal with Square Enix earlier this year. Following the deal&#x27;s completion in August, Embracer now also owns Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal, alongside major IPs including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain.


While Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal will keep their existing identities following the Embracer acquisition, Square Enix Montréal has now shaken off the last remnants of its former owner with a new name and new logo, both of which have been detailed in a lengthy post on the developer&#x27;s website. The key takeway for the curious, though, is that &quot;Onoma is Greek for name and names offer endless possibilities&quot;.

                              <span>Phil Spencer&#x27;s shelf is at it again. Ever since it was discovered the Xbox boss had secreted an Xbox Series S in plain sight behind him during a video interview months before the console was announced, fans have been scouring his furnishings for teases of more future reveals - and speculation is now mounting that Spencer has just revealed Microsoft&#x27;s long-in-the-works Xbox Game Pass streaming device on Twitter.


Spencer shared his latest shelf photo earlier today, writing, &quot;Vault Boy left the shelter and stopped by my office to celebrate the Fallout 25th Anniversary.&quot; Conspicuously, though, the Vault Boy statue that&#x27;s supposedly the focus of the tweet is far from the focus of the image. Instead, the photo continues several shelves upward, revealing a mysterious Xbox-branded box fans have so far struggled to identify - and which many are speculating might be the Xbox game-streaming box, codenamed Keystone, announced in 2021.


As described by Microsoft in an update on the project in May, the as-yet-unseen Keystone is intended to be a low-cost device enabling users to play Xbox Cloud Gaming titles through any TV or monitor without the need for a console. Reports on its exact nature have varied - some claimed it was a stick-like dongle, others a box - but whatever it was previously, Microsoft said it was &#x27;pivoting away&#x27; from the then-current iteration to refocus on &quot;a new approach&quot;.

                              <span>Twitch has responded to its controversial decision not to amend its revenue split for streamers.


At present, that split is 50/50 between Twitch and streamers, unlike key competition like YouTube that favours streamers with a 70/30 split. In a lengthy blog post last month, Twitch explained why it won&#x27;t be amending this.



Then, at TwitchCon San Diego during the Patch Notes livestream, Twitch addressed the issue once again.

Players were also able to use the in-game character creation to make a custom fighter for the closed beta and so, unsurprisingly, people decided to experiment and see how far they could push those polygons.

And boy, did you all push them.

The allegations, shared with Upper Echelon Gamers by whistleblowers, were brushed off by Quantic Lab CEO and founder Stefan Seicarescu at the time.

Known as Jedi Knight: Quest, this first-person taster offers an amusing (and a very satisfying looking) way to make one&#x27;s way through that beloved galaxy far, far away.

If you head on over to the phone notifications page on the Battle.net support site, you will see the text stating that those playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, or those with &quot;newly created Overwatch 2 accounts, and newly created Call of Duty: Modern Warfare accounts&quot;, will be  required to add a phone number to access the game. 


The page continues: &quot;Adding a phone number will allow Blizzard Entertainment to send you notifications when important changes are made to your account. Any mobile phone in a supported country with a data plan, and that is not prepaid or a VOIP number, can be used with this service&quot; (thanks, PCGamer).

                              <span>Voice actor Tara Strong has criticised the new Mario movie for not offering the titular role to Mario&#x27;s in-game voice actor, Charles Martinet.

Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures&#x27; Illumination animation division. It sees Chris Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.

In a tweet, Strong - whose own prolific career includes voice performances as Harley Quinn, Batgirl, and Fairly Odd Parents&#x27; Timmy Turner - posted a photograph of herself and Martinet with the text: &quot;it should be Charles&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard has resolved an issue where players were accidentally making store purchases whilst using in-game chat, but is allegedly not issuing refunds to those affected.

As shared on the Overwatch subreddit community, Dracyoshi reports that whilst &quot;chatting with some friends while browsing the hero gallery&quot;, the game &quot;unexpectedly began unlocking Junnker Queen&#x27;s Plutonium skin&quot;.

As they&#x27;d been writing a message in chat at the time, they weren&#x27;t able to cancel the purchase before it completed.

During her audition for the part, Ramsey was asked if she&#x27;d played any of Naughty Dog&#x27;s critically-acclaimed game. When she answered honestly - &quot;nope&quot; - she was apparently &quot;encouraged&quot; not to.

&quot;I was actually encouraged not to,&quot; Ramsey told USA Today. &quot;After my first audition, they asked me, &#x27;Have you played it?&#x27; And I said &#x27;nope&#x27;, and they said, &#x27;Keep it that way&#x27;.

Though not formally confirmed by the developer Nightdive Studios, Steam has updated the game&#x27;s store listing to reveal a March 2023 release date and pre-orders are now open. 

The upcoming release was also spotted and shared by industry insider, Wario64, although some commenters were unsure if this is a real, concrete release date or just an end-of-year placeholder. Guess we&#x27;ll find out in March, eh?

From now until the end of the year, the team is hoping to introduce three new raids - Mystic Abyss Vycas Legion, and Achates Trial Guardian - as well the Reaper Advanced class in November, and the Summoner Advanced class in December.  

&quot;The next few months mark the road to the Brelshaza Legion Raid — one of the most challenging, unique, and beautifully dangerous raids in all of Lost Ark,&quot; the team explains.

That&#x27;s according to developer Krafton, which says update 20.1 – which goes live on 11th October for PC and 19th for consoles and introduces a new ranked season – includes &quot;several improvements to weapon attachments, as well as updates to firing from vehicles, a new ranked season, world and map updates and quality-of-life updates&quot;. 

In response to the Vertical Foregrip &quot;dominating the battlegrounds as the choice grip slot attachment&quot;, the team is changing the Thumbgrip, Angled Foregrip, Halfgrip, Lightweight Grip - and the Vertical Foregrip itself - in a bid to shake things up, promising to &quot;monitor [our] plays after this balance update&quot;.

Yuzu is open-source and, crucially, legal, but as PC Gamer points out, emulation is a sticky topic for some, prompting Valve to upload an emulator-free version of the same video a short while later, which you can see below: 

&quot;Valve&#x27;s new official video for the Steam Deck has a very interesting game icon in it,&quot; industry insider Nibel tweeted yesterday, before following up with: &quot;Update: Valve has removed the original video and reuploaded a new one with a small difference.&quot;

                              <span>Another day, another Silent Hill story: this one purports, yet again, that there are &quot;several teams&quot; working on &quot;several games&quot;, including &quot;the Silent Team&quot; who were around when the first Silent Hill film was made in 2006. 

Christophe Gans, the director of the first Silent Hill movie - who we already knew was reportedly working on a third Silent Hill film - made the surprisingly candid revelations during a recent interview in which he seemingly confirmed the persistent whispers that there&#x27;s more than one Silent Hill game in development, including one by a central internal Konami team.

His interview also definitively confirms that Bloober Team is working on a Silent Hill 2 remake, several games are in development, he hasn&#x27;t worked with Kojima, and he &quot;knows a bit about&quot; the next upcoming game.

                              <span>Ever since the release of Deathloop last year, fans have speculated that the acclaimed time loop shooter was, in fact, set in the same universe as Arkane Studios&#x27; much-loved Dishonored series - and now theorists can given finally themselves a pat on the back and pack away their cork boards: the developer has confirmed it is indeed so.


Creative director Dinga Bakaba broke the news during the latest episode of the Xbox podcast (thanks PC Gamer), confirming that Deathloop is &quot;one of the futures of the Dishonored world.&quot;


When asked directly about the possible connection between the two games, Bakaba explained, &quot;We have a number of systems [that mean] not everyone has seen the same thing [in Deathloop], not everyone has heard the same song hidden somewhere, not everyone has seen every room. So it was nice to see the community pick up the little clues that we did sprinkle everywhere that, yes, indeed, we envisioned Deathloop to be happening in the future after [the third Dishonored game] Death of the Outsider.&quot;

                              <span>It looks like the end of 2022 is going to have more than a whiff of Crash Bandicoot about it. Not only has Activision confirmed an 18th October Steam release date for the well-recieved Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, it seems the publisher might just be gearing up to unveil the long-rumoured Crash Bandicoot Wumpa League at this year&#x27;s Game Awards.


All this news comes via a bit of promotional tat Activision has been sending out to influencers and press, taking the form of Crash-themed pizza box with goodies inside.


As detailed in a video by YouTuber Canadian Guy Eh (thanks Games Radar), the promotional pizza box in question comes emblazoned with the words &#x27;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-in Pizza Shack&#x27;, a not too subtle hint that the formerly Battle.net-exclusive PC version of Crash Bandicoot 4 will (as fans had already surmised) soon be making its way to Valve&#x27;s storefront. And to clear up any doubt, that&#x27;s made explicit by an attached label confirming an 18th October Steam release.

                              <span>As the nights start drawing in and the spectre of Halloween looms on the horizon, Planet Zoo is getting just a little bit spooky with the announcement of its new nocturnal-themed Twilight Pack DLC, launching on 18th October.


The big draw of Planet Zoo&#x27;s DLC is always its creature addtions, and the Twilight Pack brings five new nocturnal species: the Racoon, Red Fox, Common Wombat, Striped Skunk, and Egyptian Fruit Bat. The first four of those are free-roaming, meaning you can plop them wherever you please, while the Egyptian Fruit Bat is restricted to a walkthrough exhibit.


Players looking to infuse their zoos with a touch of gothic flair for Halloween can make use of the Twilight Pack&#x27;s 200 new scenery items, ranging from castle-themed building parts - including gargoyles and an imposing portcullis - to glowing pumpkins and cauldrons. Even the flora is getting a bit spooky, with Bristlecone pine trees, ivy, and bioluminescent ghost fungus.

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s big new 4.0 update - now officially titled Waypoint - is finally out in the wild. But while developer Hello Games broke from tradition for this latest releases, revealing some of its additions ahead of launch, the studio has now shared some extremely lengthy patch notes, discussing its contents in considerably more granular detail.


The top-level stuff we already knew about; as Hello Games boss Sean Murray told Eurogamer earlier this week, Waypoint - which arrives alongside a new Switch port for No Man&#x27;s Sky - is less about big new additions and more about major quality of life improvements.


To that end, Hello Games had previously teased a bunch of rejigging and streamlining intended to turn No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s last six years of updates &quot;into a more cohesive whole&quot;, as well as a new, less grindy Relaxed mode, a Survival mode revamp, plus extensive options for custom games.

There are currently some major plot spoilers making their way around the internet, following the apparent early release of the game&#x27;s artbook.


I will not go into details of what they are here, I am sure if you are keen to know more you will be able to find out exactly what it is that has been revealed prematurely, but this leak has caused Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer to take to Twitter to complain about spoilers in general.

This includes shooting missiles at a giant robot, as you can see in the trailer below (FYI, it is all oddly sensual).

                              <span>Earlier this year, Platinum Games made the decision to cease all updates to its beleaguered live service game Babylon&#x27;s Fall, and announced it would be  &quot;terminating the game&#x27;s service&quot; on Tuesday, 28th February 2023. The game itself had received a poor reception across the board, with criticisms ranging from its monetisation model to its £60 price tag.


However, despite the fall of Babylon&#x27;s Fall, the developer is not taking its eyes off any future live service games. 


In an interview with VGC, Platinum Games boss Atsushi Inaba said the team has &quot;learned from this experience [with Babylon&#x27;s Fall]&quot; and it had not &quot;changed [its] future plans or outlook&quot; because of it.

                              <span>The classic board game Catan is on its way to consoles in 2023.


This isn&#x27;t the first time it&#x27;s been adapted into a video game, but this new version is set for release across Xbox and PlayStation consoles.


It&#x27;s coming courtesy of Asmodee Entertainment and Dovetail Games, the former being responsible for a number of board game adaptations and the latter developing the likes of Train Sim World 2020.

                              <span>Core members of the Disco Elysium team were &quot;fired under false premises&quot;, Martin Luiga has claimed in a new interview.

Luiga, one of the co-founders of the studio ZA/UM, originally stated the three leads had left &quot;involuntarily&quot;.

Designer Robert Kurvitz, one of the developers affected, later confirmed that he, along with writer Helen Hindpere and art director Aleksander Rostov, was no longer working at the studio.

A new QR code was found at the PAX Aus gaming convention, with the enigmatic words &quot;where am I?&quot; written across its front. The code was found next to a poster of the same cryptic silhouette.


Scanning this code then leads to a new website and a picture of, yes, Elle Fanning looking back at you, as you can see below from the shot I took on my phone when I scanned the QR code for myself.

A post on the Lodestone blog advises on precautions for guarding against unauthorised account access, including resetting your Square Enix password.



&quot;We are currently experiencing an attack by a third party that is attempting to gain access to the Square Enix Account Management System by using a combination of email addresses and passwords that appear to have been obtained from other online services of other companies,&quot; reads the post.

Last night, Nintendo showed a teaser trailer for the film, but Peach didn&#x27;t feature at all.


But in McDonalds adverts - most of which have been removed from social media, confirming their legitimacy - Peach is present alongside Mario and Toad.

But this trailer was not only shared in English (the version you can see below). Universal has also been uploading this trailer to its many YouTube channels, meaning we can hear just how Toad, Kamek and the rest of those in the Mushroom Kingdom (that we have seen so far at least) sound in Spanish, Italian and more.


First up, as this one has been garnering a lot of attention on Twitter, here is the French version of Mario making his way to the Mushroom Kingdom. Or, in this case, the Royaume Champignon.

Yerli left Crytek in 2018 after more than two decades, following a turbulent period where the company struggled to stay afloat and left some staff for months without pay.


He&#x27;s now developing Room, software designed to create &quot;lifelike virtual meetings&quot;, built on a new &quot;real-time AI 3D engine&quot;. Yerli is serving as chairman and CEO of its developer, TMRW Foundation.

                              <span>RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, is getting a third paid expansion, titled Biotech - which&#x27;ll be bringing babies, mechanoids, and gene modding when it launches later this month alongside a free content update for all players.


Biotech&#x27;s first big additions come in the form of children and reproduction, with colonists and outsiders able to get pregnant and give birth - either naturally or via technological means.


Once babies grow into children, they can learn through lessons, play, or by watching adults work, with players able to determine their traits and passions every few years. Children given more attention and better education are more likely to become happy and talented adult colonists - but players can alternatively skip the nuturing and use growth vats to pump out soldiers and cheap workers to exploit.

                              <span>After years of behind-the-scenes chatter, Nintendo has shared the first trailer for its Chris-Pratt-starring animated Super Mario movie.


Announced back in 2018, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Nintendo and Universal Pictures&#x27; Illumination animation division. It sees Pratt heading an all-star cast that includes Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.


Since initial casting details broke last year, all has been largely quiet, but the veil of secrecy has finally been lifted today with the first official teaser trailer, which you can see below.

Since last July, Valve has been using a reservation system for Steam Deck orders that first required purchasers to pay a small, deductible sum to join the reservations queue then wait for an invite to make a final purchase. For some time, the wait between the two steps was upward of several months, but the gap has been steadily narrowing as Steam Deck production began to outperform Valve&#x27;s estimates.


Now, some 15 months after reservations for Steam Deck initially opened, Valve has announced the queue has been eradicated. Anyone looking to acquire a Steam Deck can now do so immediately, without needing to wait for an invitation to purchase.

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s news that Google is pulling the plug on its Stadia cloud gaming service early next year, Bethesda has confirmed all Elder Scrolls Online players using the platform will be able to transfer their accounts to PC.


&quot;Since the news of Stadia shutting down,&quot; the company wrote in a statement shared on Twitter, &quot;Bethesda Softworks and ZeniMax Online Studios have been discussing the next steps for our Elder Scrolls Online Stadia players and we appreciate your patience&quot;.


&quot;We are happy to share that our Stadia players will be able to transfer their ESO accounts to PC,&quot; it continued, &quot;bringing with them all of their progress, including but not limited to existing characters, purchased items, achievements, and inventory. Since Stadia players already play ESO on our PC servers, all of their friends and guilds will be waiting for them once they complete the transfer.&quot; Bethesda says it&#x27;ll be sharing details on how to make the transfer soon.

                              <span>Together We Rule, the first major expansion for developer Amplitude Studios&#x27; historical 4X strategy game Humankind, has been given a 9th November release date - and there&#x27;s free play weekend for the base game starting today too.


Together We Rule follows the release of two smaller, culture-focused DLC packs for Humankind - one themed around Africa, the other Latin America - and introduces diplomacy and espionage features intended to &quot;help players see the world in a new light and resolve conflicts differently&quot;.


These include the new Congress of Humankind - giving players the means to vote and decide on global doctrines and arbitrate international conflicts - as well as the new Embassy Quarter. The latter can be used to sign mutually beneficial agreements with other empires or force them into taking specific actions through Leverage - a special currency generated by the expansion&#x27;s new Agent units that can be spent to infiltrate, sabotage, and disinform other empires.

Upon its 11th October release, this expansion will bring a whole new element to your gameplay: Survival against some heinous zombies.


&quot;Just in time for spooky season, Undead adds a mix of survival and horror to Prison Architect that will put Wardens&#x27; management skills to the test,&quot; said game director Gaz Wright. &quot;Grappling with the task of survival is no easy feat, as it introduces an extra layer of complexity and pressure to management gameplay.&quot; You can see a little teaser for this expansion below.

                              <span>When EA released Battlefield 2042 almost 11 months ago, the promise of a live service Battlefield game filled brim with a constant stream of content updates was one of the key selling points.


In fact, the live service model was supposed to be used as a substitute for the traditional story campaign, where in-game events would fill in the lore of the new climate-change ridden world.


But all of that was postponed thanks to dire state of the game at launch. Now almost a year since launch and two seasons later, we finally have our first in-season event and new game mode.

But at around the 7.17 mark, just as one trainer enters the town of Artazon, a number of new &#x27;mon can be seen on the minimap at the bottom right of the screen.

It sounds like all of the above will be available via the game&#x27;s store, save for Spock - you&#x27;ll get him with Fall Guys&#x27; current season pass, alongside a Borg mask. I have to say, I really love these designs.

Starbreeze, best known for its development of the Payday series, fell from grace following the disastrous launch of Overkill&#x27;s The Walking Dead on Steam back in 2018.


The game&#x27;s failure led to severe financial issues and the exit of the company&#x27;s boss Bo Andersson. Wesley Yin-Poole produced a full-length feature on the company&#x27;s collapse in 2019 which I recommend you give a thorough read if you want the full context.

Doing so will unlock the Resilient Suit and Concussive Blast Gadget in-game, as well as two skill points. Players will also receive news, updates and offers from PlayStation Studios on PC or PlayStation platforms.


Spider-Man Remastered is the first PlayStation game on PC to offer this option, though it looks like Trophy support isn&#x27;t included. It&#x27;s unclear if previous games will also be updated with this feature, or if it will be included in future releases like Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves.

                              <span>For those who have been immersing themselves in Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s cosy content over the last few weeks or so, well, it looks like it could be about to get a whole lot cosier.


A survey on the official Twitter feed has asked fans if they would like to be &quot;able to interact with [their] animal companions?&quot;


There are then three options presented for you to choose from. These are: &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;YES&quot; (an important use of all capital letters there for emphasis) or &quot;Yes (in the next update)!&quot;

That&#x27;s from 27th October to 1st November, but there&#x27;s more happening in the horror game all month in its Haunted by Daylight season, including outfits and a new tome.


That tome is called Malevolence and will include memories for Killer Ghost Face and Survivor Mikaela Reid.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing the avalance of announcements to come from CD Projekt Red, maker of The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077.


Taking a leaf out of Ubisoft&#x27;s recent playbook - when it lay the entirety of its Assassin&#x27;s Creed plans on the table - CD Projekt Red has done similar, discussing projects which we&#x27;ll see release across the whole of the next decade. There&#x27;s going to be a new trilogy of new Witcher games, a Cyberpunk sequel, a new IP and various other spin-offs - though there was no word on Cyberpunk&#x27;s standalone multiplayer portion, and still no firm date for The Witcher 3&#x27;s long-awaited current-gen console update.

With questions still to answer about what we&#x27;d known was coming, how likely is it we&#x27;ll see any of these fresh projects soon? And if not, why announce them now? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan share their thoughts.

                              <span>After months of speculation, leaks and rumours, EA has finally revealed the next installment of the Need for Speed in a swanky new trailer. 


Need for Speed Unbound is lush with an anime aesthetic that&#x27;s combined with the grungy street racing vibes of early Need for Speed games. 


The trailer features American rapper A$AP Rocky, who is heard narrating in the beginning of the trailer before finishing off with what appears to be a brand-new track from the rapper.

                              <span>Brazil has approved Microsoft&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


In new documentation issued by the country&#x27;s Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE) on Wednesday, the regulator stated it has approved of this deal &quot;without restrictions&quot;.


Along with this approval, CADE did touch on the more high-profile elements of this proposed acquisition, including Activision&#x27;s Call of Duty franchise - a franchise which has recently felt like it&#x27;s been caught up in a custody battle between Xbox and PlayStation.

Spiral Abyss is the only true endgame content for players at high Adventure Ranks. In a recent Gamespot interview, a miHoYo spokesperson was asked if there were plans to release more permanent endgame content in the &quot;same vein&quot;.


&quot;The Spiral Abyss is one of the most effective ways [for] players [to] test out their party composition and combat strength,&quot; miHoYo replied. &quot;If we design another type of permanent endgame that is similar to the Spiral Abyss, it might end up creating excessive anxiety for our players - not everyone is interested in Musk Reef.&quot;

Most significant is the game&#x27;s Let&#x27;s Go feature that allows partner Pokémon to be sent off to battle others alone in the world, or gather items, which should make grinding much smoother.

                              <span>Activision has released its first gameplay trailer of the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which gives us our first glimpse of the first-person shooter&#x27;s campaign.


The trailer largely confirms the rumours and leaks of the past few months which suggested the campaign would involve the global War on Drugs. 


Task Force 141 is deployed in an unnamed South American country, as it seeks out a terrorist that appears to be allied with drug traffickers. Essentially, the story entangles the War on Terror with the War on Drugs.

                              <span>A PlayStation trailer listing that suggested EA Motive&#x27;s upcoming Dead Space remake will launch for PS4 as well as PS5 is a mistake, Eurogamer understands. 


EA&#x27;s latest trailer for the game was published today on PlayStation&#x27;s official YouTube channel for Latin America, which has 664,000 subscribers, and wrongly labels the revived survival horror as coming to both PS4 and PS5. 


The listing sparked fan speculation and media reports that the game was also quietly being developed for PS4 and Xbox One.

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s surprise announcement that Google would be shutting down Stadia in January, the platform&#x27;s small but dedicated community have petitioned Google to allow the controller to work on other platforms wirelessly. 


The Stadia controller currently works on other devices via a USB cable, but it also has wireless functionality in the form of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that&#x27;s firmware locked. 


While owners wait for a response from Google, some have taken matters into their own hands with some quirky workarounds.

What is the Lost Between Worlds expansion? That&#x27;s a good question - since Ubisoft is yet to announce it. We&#x27;ve asked the publisher for more information today.


Still, details for the Far Cry 6 Game of the Year Edition are now live via listings on the Xbox and PlayStation stores. These note that Lost Between Worlds is &quot;coming soon&quot; - so your £100 purchase will simply grant access whenever it does become available.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has acquired a majority stake in Limbic Entertainment, the developer behind its forthcoming sim game Park Beyond.


The deal marks an increased investment in the German developer, representing the publisher&#x27;s move to create a significant proportion of its business outside of Japan. 


Park Beyond will be Limbic&#x27;s highest profile release so far: a theme park game where players can create bizarre attractions using the &quot;impossification&quot; gimmick. Bandai Namco aims for Limbic&#x27;s sim games to become the new standard.

Many fans have been left unable to play for long periods, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.


These issues have been exacerbated by a series of DDOS attacks aimed at the game&#x27;s servers. And today, following a bruising 24 hours, Blizzard has apologised.

It was previously mandatory for players to enroll in the &quot;SMS Protect&quot; system to access the game. Players who declined would be unable to login to the game&#x27;s servers. 


Blizzard argued that SMS Protect was necessary as the game transitioned to a live service free-to-play model, in order to combat &quot;disruptive behaviour&quot; and stop banned users simply creating a new account.

                              <span>With less than 24 hours to go until the long-awaited reveal of EA and developer Criterion&#x27;s latest Need for Speed game, a full name, plus a release date, and screens have leaked online.


All this comes via a listing, still live at the time of writing, on Japanese retailer Neowing&#x27;s website - which, assuming its veracity (highly likely given the nature of the assets and details included), corroborates virtually all previous rumours circulating around the game in recent months.


First is the name, Need for Speed: Unbound, which tallies with a report from Insider Gaming at the end of September, as does Neowing&#x27;s listed release date of 2nd December this year.

Inquisitor - Martyr is a Diablo-esque take on the Warhammer 40,000 universe, casting players as Inquisitors who must battle their way, either solo or with friends, through a &quot;haunted fortress-monastery which hides a terrible secret from the past&quot;.


It features cover-based combat, four classes (Psyker, Crusader, Assassin, and Tech-Adept, with the new Sororitas class due at a later date), a procedurally generated mission system, skill trees, a wide range of weapons and vehicles, two-player local co-op on consoles - as well as four-player online multiplayer - and more.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the superb rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, has expanded once more, this time introducing a free Boss Rush mode - and an assortment of related rewards for those with sufficient skills - for players on PC.


Boss Rush mode is accessed through a basement door in the Prisoner&#x27;s Quarters and features four different stages to battle through. All four stages feature back-to-back bosses to defeat, one containing three bosses, another featuring five bosses, plus two more containing three and five enhanced bosses respectively. These enhanced bosses feature &quot;more ways to kick your ass&quot;, including new limbs, healing powers, and even some friends to help them.


Each of the four challenges feature bosses randomly selected from three tiers (although players must have encountered them in Normal mode before they appear), with three-boss challenges starting with a boss from Tier 1, then moving on to Tier 2, then Tier 3. Five-boss challenges feature two Tier 1 bosses, two Tier 2 bosses, then a final boss from Tier 3.

                              <span>Nintendo has quietly tightened up its policies regarding the release of adult games on Switch, a publisher has said.


In a recent Twitter thread (thanks, Nintendo Everything), adult game publisher Gamuzumi told fans it had heard back from Nintendo after facing an unexpected delay in the launch of its most recent title, Hot Tentacles Shooter.


According to Gamuzumi, which describes itself as a &quot;boutique publisher focused on releasing mature or &#x27;ecchi&#x27; [softcore hentai] titles&quot;, Nintendo has now ruled that games featuring topless anime women are no longer allowed.

Wild Hearts, a collaboration between EA Originals and Koei Tecmo&#x27;s Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series), transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan where up to three players can battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.


Omega Force - which has previous experience in the monster hunting genre, courtesy of its two Toukiden games - has now expanded on Wild Hearts&#x27; initial reveal with seven minutes of new, largely uninterrupted gameplay footage.

Yesterday, the Polish developer released a detailed timeline documenting all its upcoming games for the foreseeable future. This included the next game in the Cyberpunk series, which is codenamed &quot;Orion&quot;, along with updates on its Witcher series and a new IP known for now as &quot;Hadar&quot;.


Following this announcement, CD Projekt Red&#x27;s global PR director Radek Grabowski shared that the company would  establish a new studio, known as CD Projekt Red North America, to lead its next Cyberpunk-based project.

If you are put on the waitlist, you will be able to gain access &quot;in about two months&quot; from your registration date.

The role has instead gone to Jennifer Hale, who has voiced characters such as Commander Shephard in Mass Effect and Naomi Hunter in the Metal Gear Solid series, to name but a few.


In an interview with Game Informer, which features Bayonetta 3 as its cover this issue, director Yusuke Miyata explained that &quot;overlapping circumstances&quot; meant that Taylor was unable to reprise her role as Bayonetta. As such, Hale stepped in to take the place of the series&#x27; title role, with Miyata stating he felt she was a &quot;good match for the character&quot; (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

                              <span>Fortnite seemingly has everything these days. The Rock. Indiana Jones. Ripley from Alien. Now, it has the car from Rocket League. 


At least this collaboration makes some sense - both Rocket League maker Psyonix and Fortnite are products of Epic Games, which has already worked in the past to bring its two audiences together.


Now, you can drive Rocket League&#x27;s most famous vehicle - the Octane - within Fortnite. As you&#x27;d expect, it behaves just as it would on a Rocket League pitch - able to boost to high speeds and rapidly climb up walls.

On Steam, its £50 price sits in line with other upcoming AAA launches, such as Gotham Knights, Sonic Frontiers, The Callisto Protocol, Hogwarts Legacy and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns.

On console, the price point for these games varies a little more. Sonic Frontiers is £50, Callisto Protocol is £55 and Hogwarts Legacy is £60, while Gotham Knights and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns are £65.

With this app in play, users will now be able to see all of the channel&#x27;s offerings in Ultra HD thanks to its 4K HDR playback support (the PlayStation 4 version of the app was limited to 1080p).


&quot;A key part of our global expansion strategy is to meet consumers wherever they are, which is why we&#x27;re excited to enhance both Disney Plus and Star Plus for PlayStation 5 users,&quot; said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of product and design for Disney streaming (thanks, The Verge). &quot;The ability to support 4K HDR video streaming on the platform will also improve the viewing experience for fans.&quot;

New documentation from the CMA states that its statutory deadline to publish the final report will be 1st March, 2023. As such, the final deadline for all parties&#x27; responses regarding this investigation will be in February.


Between that time and now, the CMA will be conducting meetings with the main and third parties involved with this acquisition, issuing questionnaires and verifying the information provided.

                              <span>The European Union has voted to adopt a single charger design for use across all portable games consoles, smartphones, tablets and laptops sold in the region. 


Technology manufacturers will now be required to use USB-C charging ports in all smartphones and tablets sold in the region from 2024, and in laptops from 2026. Mice, keyboards, headphones are also included.


As previously reported, the UK decided to opt out out of being included in this initiative when it was first proposed, despite its aims to cut electronic waste and generally make things a bit easier for those with a drawer full of random Lightning cables,  micro-USB and mini-USB wires. Thanks Brexit!

We expect the brand new Third Party Security Audit of Kubernetes will be
published later this month (Oct 2022).
In preparation for that, let&#x27;s look at the state of findings that were made
public as part of the last third party security audit of
2019
that was based on Kubernetes v1.13.4.
Motivation
Craig Ingram has graciously attempted over the years to keep track of the
status of the findings reported in the last audit in this issue:
kubernetes/kubernetes#81146.
This blog post will attempt to dive deeper into this, address any gaps
in tracking and become a point in time summary of the state of the
findings reported from 2019.

Players have reported unexpected server errors and difficulties joining Overwatch 2 games throughout the evening following today&#x27;s free-to-play launch, with some claiming to be experiencing queues of as many as 40,000 other players.


An earlier tweet by Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra acknowledged today&#x27;s server woes but gave no indication they might be the result of anything other that launch day teething troubles, only thanking players for their patience and pledging to &quot;get [them] into the fun&quot;.

                              <span>Tequila Works, the developer behind the likes of the sublime Rime and intriguing VR murder-mystery The Invisible Hours, has confirmed its formerly Stadia-exclusive action-adventure Gylt will be going multiplatform next year.


Gylt, an enjoyably surreal horror yarn that follows the adventures of a young girl in search of her missing cousin, launched exclusively on Stadia back in 2019. And while Tequila Works did at one point suggest a multiplatform release might eventually be on the cards, it&#x27;s remained resolutely Stadia-bound in the years since.


However, following last week&#x27;s announcement that Google will be shutting down Stadia on 18th January next year - a move that prompted questions as to what might happen to the cloud gaming service&#x27;s handful of remaining exclusives - Tequila Works has confirmed Gylt will finally be getting a multiplatform release some time in 2023.

&quot;I am beginning a brand-new personal chapter at CD Projekt,&quot; Iwiński wrote in a statement shared following the company&#x27;s latest investor meeting, &quot;as I will submit my candidacy for the role of Chairman of the Supervisory Board, leaving behind my joint-CEO role. By the end of 2022, I&#x27;ll hand over my duties to my colleagues from the board.&quot;


&quot;For me this is a huge moment,&quot; Iwiński continued. &quot;I&#x27;ve been at CD Projekt for almost 30 years and I have seen it go from a handful of passion-driven rebels to an internationally recognised developer of story-driven role-playing games loved by millions globally. Back when Michał Kiciński and I founded the company, I don&#x27;t think either of us would have been able to imagine this incredible journey, not even in our wildest dreams.&quot;

                              <span>PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst has revealed Sony&#x27;s first-party PlayStation releases will likely take &quot;at least a year&quot; to launch on PC, although live-service games might come sooner.


Sony initially confirmed it was exploring bringing its first-party PlayStation exclusives to PC in March 2020, announcing that Horizon Zero Dawn would lead the charge - although it said &quot;releasing one first-party AAA title to PC doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that every game now will come to PC&quot; and that it didn&#x27;t have plans to follow Xbox&#x27;s lead with day-and-date PC releases.


Since then, following the successful launch of Horizon Zero Dawn on PC, the number of titles joining the platform has continued to grow. Days Gone, God of War, and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered have already made the jump, with Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Uncharted: The Legacy Collection, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure confirmed to be on the way.

                              <span>Sega has announced a three-month delay to Company of Heroes 3, which will now arrive on 23rd February 2023. 


Announcing the hold-up this afternoon, Sega said Relic Entertainment&#x27;s real-time strategy threequel was currently &quot;not quite up to our players&#x27; or our own high standards&quot;, with &quot;bugs to squash, pixels to polish, gameplay to adjust and feedback to address&quot;. 


On that last point, Sega says developer Relic is continuing to react to community feedback on improvements to the game&#x27;s dynamic campaign map, a stronger visual focus on &quot;grit and details&quot; during battles, an overhauled light system, plus tweaks to the HUD and UI.

Freelancer will now arrive as a free update for existing Hitman 3 owners on 26th January 2023.


Before that, developer IO Interactive will run a Steam test for the mode in November - with details to follow later this month on exactly when it will start and how it will work.

Bloober Team shared the news in a blog post earlier today, where the company announced it had signed a cooperation agreement with Polish visual arts complany Platige Image to bring its game to a new medium (see what I did there).


This upcoming adaptation will be helmed by Tomasz Bagiński, whose resume includes Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher. Meanwhile, Bloober Team&#x27;s Piotr Babieno will work alongside Bagiński bringing this adaptation to life.

At the end of August, both Sony and Chinese publisher Tencent increased their shareholding in the Elden Ring and Soulsbourne studio. Sony now owns just over 14 percent.


Now, speaking to Reuters, PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst has said the purchase opened up the possibility of FromSoftware properties getting the PlayStation Productions treatment.

Per The Washington Post, Activision Blizzard and the QA testers from Raven Software will now continue on with their negotiations to agree a collective bargaining agreement.
However, if the two parties can not settle upon an agreement, the NLRB can issue a complaint against Activision Blizzard. Another option would be for the NLRB to prosecute the case before a federal judge should the company refuse to settle, although this is deemed unlikely.

Officially, that is. 


Unofficially, we&#x27;ve glimpsed a leaked clip of early gameplay that doesn&#x27;t tell us a great deal, and there have been industry whispers to expect the game in December.

                              <span>YouTuber Colour has spoken about the effect Stadia&#x27;s death will have on many of the people he met while playing almost 6000 hours of Red Dead Online.

He also voiced his frustrations towards Rockstar, which is currently keeping quiet about whether character transfers will be available for the game.

Last week, Colour shared a screenshot of his playtime in Red Dead Redemption 2 on Stadia on Twitter. In a follow-up tweet he tagged Rockstar, asking for a character transfer.

The pound, mercifully, is not yet affected - but many other countries will be. These include Poland, Sweden, Chile, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea and Vietnam, plus Pokémon&#x27;s homeland of Japan - a core market for Pokémon Go.


And while the change is driven by Apple&#x27;s action, Niantic has said it will raise its prices in-game whether you use an iPhone or not.

Yes, medieval multiplayer Chivalry 2 is making its way onto Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service today.


&quot;Chivalry 2 is coming... and you&#x27;re gonna need a battlecry,&quot; Microsoft proclaimed via its Xbox Game Pass Twitter account, alongside a short clip showing off some of the in-game shenanigans you too will be able to take part in. This includes running into the fray clutching a chicken and launching yourself off battlements.

A jury has decided the companies must pay $3750 to Catherine Alexander, who designed tattoos for pro wrestler Randy Orton, after their likenesses appeared on Orton&#x27;s character in WWE 2K16, 17 and 18.


Alexander had pushed for a higher amount, including a share of profits from the games, Reuters reported. Still, the decision appears to mark a landmark judgement that may affect future usage rights in other games in future.

It’s a weird story, and the FBI affidavit raises more questions than it answers. The employee only worked for the NSA for three weeks—which is weird in itself. I can’t figure out how he linked up with the undercover FBI agent. It’s not clear how much of this was the employee’s idea, and whether he was goaded by the FBI agent. Still, hooray for not leaking NSA secrets to the Russians. (And, almost ten years after Snowden, do we still have this much trouble vetting people before giving them security clearances?)...</span>

Whether on-premises or in the cloud, clusters face real constraints for resource usage, quota, and cost management reasons. Regardless of the autoscalling capabilities, clusters have finite capacity. As a result, users want an easy way to fairly and
efficiently share resources.
In this article, we introduce Kueue,
an open source job queueing controller designed to manage batch jobs as a single unit.
Kueue leaves pod-level orchestration to existing stable components of Kubernetes.
Kueue natively supports the Kubernetes Job
API and offers hooks for integrating other custom-built APIs for batch jobs.
Why Kueue?
Job queueing is a key feature to run batch workloads at scale in both on-premises and cloud environments. The main goal…</span>

Fans gathered earlier today to witness the final moments of Overwatch, recording the momentous occasion for posterity. Despite its place in the gaming pantheon, though, it met an unceremonious end, blinking out of existing with a simple &quot;disconnected&quot; message.


A few official lobby chat server messages did at least attempt to imbue the occasion with some import, telling players, &quot;Even the best journeys end, but a new one is right around the corner. Thank you, heroes! See you October 4th!&quot;. A final message ahead of Overwatch 1&#x27;s oblivion simply read, &quot;See you on the other side&quot;.

                              <span>With just a few months to go until the release of EA Motive&#x27;s intriguing Dead Space remake, the developer has confirmed it&#x27;ll be giving the spruced-up sci-fi horror its first proper gameplay reveal tomorrow, 4th October.


Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games&#x27; much-loved 2008 original, once again putting players in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke as they journey through the Necromorph-infested mining ship USG Ishimura. This time, though, EA Motive is attempting to bolster the fear factor on modern systems with enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks including improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Since confirming a Dead Space remake was in the works last year, EA Motive has been unusually open about its development process, detailing the project&#x27;s progress in a series of livestreams focusing on gameplay changes, audio, and art.

                              <span>Retro Studios, the team behind Metroid Prime and Donkey Kong Country Returns, once pitched a Zelda game for the Nintendo DS akin to Final Fantasy Tactics.


This project was dubbed Heroes of Hyrule, and would not have had Link as the main character. Rather, the Hylian hero would have turned up as an NPC. 


Per YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming, which got its hands on Retro Studios&#x27; original pitch, Heroes of Hyrule would have told the story of a magical book.

                              <span>Former staff members at Burnout developer Criterion have revealed their scrapped plans for a sequel to the studio&#x27;s first-person shooter project Black. 


When Black launched in 2006 for PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, it promised to be Criterion&#x27;s revolutionary take on the FPS genre - just as Burnout had won legions of fans for the studio&#x27;s version of racing. 


The game recieved largely positive reviews, though early plans for a sequel never materialised. Some who worked on the game, including its namesake Stuart Black, later left to make Bodycount - a spiritual successor developed by Codemasters.

That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which has reported that mass production of the headset began last month.

These high production figures show Sony has an &quot;ambitious&quot; roadmap ahead of the VR2&#x27;s release, it was said.

                              <span>High-profile mod maker Lance McDonald has released footage of what looks to be a working PlayStation 5 exploit that leaves the console &quot;jailbroken&quot;. 


McDonald&#x27;s video appears to show custom code being read by a PS5 through an exploit in its online User Guide. Once run, the console is able to access debug settings and then install the infamous PT demo - which is, of course, no longer available under normal circumstances.


So, how bad is this for Sony? Well, for now, the use of this exploit is limited. Reportedly this method is still &quot;fairly unstable&quot; and offers &quot;read/write access, but no execute&quot; - so you could download the PT demo, for example, but not yet play it.

While Google confirmed it will refund all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store, as well as all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store, users have been left concerned about their in-game data. 


Thankfully, developers are trying to ensure these players are not going to see their efforts wasted when Stadia ultimately closes its doors.


Sharing an update on Twitter, Hitman developer IO Interactive announced it was currently &quot;looking into ways&quot; for its Google Stadia fans to &quot;continue [their] Hitman experience on other platforms&quot;.

But Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has now beaten that, as noted on Twitter by GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s Brendan Sinclair.

Originally revealed by MP1st, this remaster will allegedly bring Zero Dawn closer in terms of visuals to its successor, Forbidden West. 


While, at the time of writing, it is unclear whether this is a &quot;from the ground up&quot; remake of the 2017 title, it is claimed that this version of Zero Dawn will see new character models, improvements to the game&#x27;s lighting system and animations, and &quot;overhauled textures&quot;.

                              <span>This is interesting research:
In this paper, we develop a new mechanism for detecting audio deepfakes using techniques from the field of articulatory phonetics. Specifically, we apply fluid dynamics to estimate the arrangement of the human vocal tract during speech generation and show that deepfakes often model impossible or highly-unlikely anatomical arrangements. When parameterized to achieve 99.9% precision, our detection mechanism achieves a recall of 99.5%, correctly identifying all but one deepfake sample in our dataset.

Kubernetes v1.25 introduces the support for user namespaces.
This is a major improvement for running secure workloads in
Kubernetes. Each pod will have access only to a limited subset of the
available UIDs and GIDs on the system, thus adding a new security
layer to protect from other pods running on the same system.
How does it work?
A process running on Linux can use up to 4294967296 different UIDs and
GIDs.
User namespaces is a Linux feature that allows mapping a set of users
in the container to different users in the host, thus restricting what
IDs a process can effectively use.
Furthermore, the capabilities granted in a new user namespace do not
apply in the host initial namespaces.
Why is it important?

Announced at this week&#x27;s Hasbro PulseCon, the first six double-sided cards feature your favourite Transformers in both vehicular and robot form, and there&#x27;s two versions of each Transformer, as they come in both a retro 1980s style as well as their inversed Shattered Glass variant.

So far cards featuring Optimus Prime, Starscream, Soundwave, Slicer, Goldbug, and Flamewar have been confirmed, and will reportedly be available in The Brothers&#x27; War sets, as well as Bundle Box and collector boosters, too.

                              <span>A GTA 5 player who failed their in-game driving test is only using public transport to get around Los Santos. 

After failing their San Andreas driving test, redditor MotorDesigner reached out to the GTA subreddit for advice on the best way to get around the city without a car - legally, in other words, even though the concept is comically novel in any GTA game, of course.

Admittedly, the in-game driving test doesn&#x27;t look too troublesome - questions include when it&#x27;s permissible to run a red light, what the correct driving position is, and how best to drive when &quot;getting serviced orally by a girl while driving&quot; - MotorDesigner failed to meet the San Andreas Department of Motor Vehicles&#x27; low, low standards, and therefore cannot drive legally in the city.

Bloomberg reports that Townsend - who also serves as executive vice president of corporate affairs - will step down ahead of Microsoft&#x27;s billion pound deal to acquire Activision (if it goes through, of course).

Townsend will, however, remain with the company as an advisor to the board and CEO Bobby Kotick, although his future at the company is also in doubt if and when the acquisition goes through.

                              <span>Chinese megacorp Tencent is reportedly &quot;resetting its mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) strategy&quot; by focussing on &quot;buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies&quot;.

According to Reuters, Tencent traditionally acquired minority stakes and was content with being a &quot;passive financial investor&quot;, but it is now &quot;aggressively seeking to own majority or even controlling stakes in overseas targets&quot;, chiefly in the &quot;core gaming sector&quot;. Metaverse assets are also reportedly of interest to Tencent. 

Citing &quot;four people with direct knowledge of the matter&quot;, Reuters adds that the shift in Tencent&#x27;s M&amp;A strategy &quot;comes as the world&#x27;s number one gaming firm by revenue is counting on global markets for its future growth, which requires a strong portfolio of chart-topping games&quot; and follows regulatory issues in its home country.

In a series of messages shared on Twitter, Dandy @ 6.2 –  who clarifies that they are &quot;not a victim in this&quot; but is &quot;speaking out for a friend who IS a victim who otherwise felt like she had no voice&quot; – posts a number of incriminating messages that intimate that despite reporting him, the alleged &quot;sex pest&quot; known as Charcoal Salamander had yet to be stripped of his &quot;admin&quot; role on the server. 

&quot;So who else knew that the Phasmophobia devs are housing a sex pest in their official discord by keeping him admin and refusing to take any claims against him seriously because I sure do now,&quot; tweeted Dandy @ 6.2.

Entitled War Games: Real Conflicts | Virtual Worlds | Extreme Entertainment, the exhibition is running from now until May 2023 and seeks to &quot;delve into one of today’s most popular storytelling mediums and ask how the reality of war is represented in the virtual world of a video game&quot;.

We’re now learning that the CIA is still “using an irresponsibly secured system for asset communication.”
Citizen Lab did the research:
Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used these sites for covert communication...</span>

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing the failure of Stadia, and why Google&#x27;s cloud gaming gamble struggled from the start.


The announcement of Stadia&#x27;s demise came as a shock to some - including many developers with titles only weeks from launch - yet still feels like it was on the cards for some time. After a rocky launch and the closure of Google&#x27;s internal game development studios, what future did Stadia have left? Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson weighed in earlier today with his thoughts.

Could Stadia have been a success? What does this all mean for game preservation? And if Google failed, with all of its billions, what future does cloud gaming have elsewhere? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, and Liv Ngan share their thoughts.

                              <span>A lifelong Nintendo fan has decided to make a realistic Super Mario Bros remake, and posted a movie-style trailer on YouTube to document their most recent update.

The YouTuber, who has uploaded their videos to the channel Re-Imagined Games, started work on the remake over two months ago.

In order to create the game, they&#x27;ve had to learn Unreal Engine 5 with zero experience in video game development.

According to a new report from 9to5google, the project received initial approval but as it was intended to be a strictly single-player experience (instead of the asynchronous multiplayer in Death Stranding), the Kojima collaboration was cancelled as Google believed there was no longer a market for solo games.



Despite reaching the early stages of development, the project was reportedly cancelled by Stadia&#x27;s general manager Phil Harrison in mid 2020 following the first mockups.

                              <span>Dragon Age developer BioWare has shared a few new snippets from the upcoming and long-awaited Dreadwolf, in the form of a few fresh codex entries. 


These tidbits are not meant to tease any particular storyline from Dreadwolf, but are included in a blog post detailing how BioWare&#x27;s writing team works together to build Dragon Age&#x27;s expansive world. 


The first codex entry presented here comes from a character&#x27;s diary - someone who, if we had to guess, is likely one of your new companions.

                              <span>Twitch is testing a feature where viewers can pay up to $100 to highlight a message in chat.


Elevated Chat, as it&#x27;s known, is currently a limited time experiment for four weeks only available for select streamers.


It allows viewers to pay to &quot;elevate&quot; their message in chat, either pinned to the top of chat or at the bottom of the video player. Varying payment amounts allows for various amounts of time for elevation.

Quality assurance tester Mackenzie Clifton has spoken publicly to Axios about their departure from Nintendo of America, and revealed both the question on unionisation they asked, as well as the &quot;confidential information&quot; they were accused of leaking. 


During a January company Q&amp;A with Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser, Clifton says they submitted the following question: &quot;What does NoA think about the unionisation trend in QA in the games industry as of late?&quot;

There weren&#x27;t many exclusive games available on the streaming service, but with game preservation continuing to be a hot topic, there are a number of games at risk unless they&#x27;re ported to other platforms.

Currently, the Stadia controller can only be used through Stadia, which itself is only compatible with a limited number of devices.

                              <span>A little over six months after its big reveal, World of Warcraft&#x27;s Dragonflight expansion has been given a release date, with its launch now officially scheduled for 28th November this year.


As detailed back in April, Dragonflight&#x27;s first major addition is a new location known as the Dragon Isles, the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind. This, in turn, brings four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, the expansive Ohn&#x27;ahran Plains, the frozen Azure Span, and the majestic Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also introduces a new playable race-class hybrid (a first for WoW) known as the Dracthyr Evokers, which can switch between human and draconic forms. Depending on a player&#x27;s chosen class specialisations, its focus is either damage dealing or healing.

                              <span>Google is shutting down Stadia, with the beleaguered cloud gaming service set to remain live for players until 18th January 2023.


Stadia&#x27;s misfortunes are, of course, well-documented; despite initial praise for the service&#x27;s streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia&#x27;s failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.


And while Google continued to insist Stadia was &quot;alive and well&quot; as 2021 progressed, reports claimed it had &quot;deprioritised&quot; the consumer-facing side of its game streaming platform, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services&#x27; underlying technology to third-parties.

The highlight of this new investment package is 50bn riyals (£12bn) earmarked for the acquisition of &quot;a leading game publisher to become a strategic development partner,&quot; according to the state&#x27;s press agency.  


Another 70 billion riyals (£16bn) is pegged for minority stakes in other companies, while the rest will be spent targeting industry disruptors and mature industry partners to enhance Savvy&#x27;s portfolio.

&quot;From the moment you start the game to the moment you end the game, there are no camera cuts or load screens—unless you die,&quot; says senior producer Philippe Ducharme.

The anime adaptation of the cult classic Sega game was first announced back in September 2020, before being broadcasted and available to stream on Adult Swim and Crunchyroll respectively.  


A second season was reportedly in the works before the cancellation, which is likely a part of the wider purge by Warner Discovery of its properties following the merger of the two media conglomerates in April this year.

Immutable fields can be found in a few places in the built-in Kubernetes types.
For example, you can&#x27;t change the .metadata.name of an object. Specific objects
have fields where changes to existing objects are constrained; for example, the
.spec.selector of a Deployment.
Aside from simple immutability, there are other common design patterns such as
lists which are append-only, or a map with mutable values and immutable keys.
Until recently the best way to restrict field mutability for CustomResourceDefinitions
has been to create a validating
admission webhook:
this means a lot of complexity for the common case of making a field immutable.

In a Twitter thread, developer Gameloft said it expected the update to launch &quot;in around three weeks&quot;, and fix several priority bugs such as issues with lost progress, missing founder&#x27;s pack rewards, and general console crashes.


October&#x27;s update will also add new features, such as an improved photo mode and new poses for your character avatar.

Warzone, which launched as a standalone free-to-play battle royale in March 2020 following the successful launch of 2019&#x27;s Modern Warfare soft reboot, was an overnight phenomenon fuelled by lockdowns that made billions of dollars for Activision.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority has found several mobile phone game adverts likely to cause &quot;serious or widespread offence&quot; due to harmful gender stereotypes. 


An advert for one game, Refantasia: Charm and Conquer, is described as having featured an &quot;anime-style image of a young woman in a cage&quot; in shackles and with torn clothing, which was singled out for particular criticism. 


Captions referenced &quot;my master&quot; and were accompanied by text which described the person as a &quot;little girl&quot;. The ASA judged the character as being someone under 18 represented in a sexual manner.

                              <span>After two years in early access for PC and Xbox, garden adventure game Grounded has blossomed into a full release - something which developer Obsidian Games has now described as &quot;the complete game&quot; which can now &quot;beat&quot; for the first time. 


That story will now explain how players got to be so Honey I Shrunk The Kids small, Obsidian says, and potentially also allow you to &quot;go big and go home&quot; once all is said and done. 


Before that, though, there&#x27;s plenty of new things to experience in version 1.0. A new area of the garden, the Eastern Upper Yard, has been opened up to players. It features a new tunnel system, more towering manmade items and fresh &quot;angry bugs&quot;.

The addition is part of a general spruce up for Man of Medan and Little Hope, the first two entries in Supermassive&#x27;s Dark Pictures Anthology series. 


Other tweaks include new difficulty settings and QTE warnings, improved UI, increased walking speeds and more accessibility options including the ability to resize subtitles.

Artemis will be a metaverse game featuring NFTs, as announced on Nathan Brown&#x27;s Hit Points.



&quot;I&#x27;m just going to do what I&#x27;m going to do,&quot; he said. &quot;[Artemis is] this thing that we want to create, and it&#x27;s going to give people a lot of fun, a lot of pleasure, and a lot of meaningful things to do. But it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s called the metaverse. I don&#x27;t care what people want to call it.&quot;

The file details a number of bugs found at Soviet diplomatic facilities in Washington, D.C., New York, and San Francisco, as well as in a Russian government-owned vacation compound, apartments used by Russia personnel, and even Russian diplomats’ cars. And the bugs were everywhere: encased in plaster in an apartment closet; behind electrical and television outlets; bored into concrete bricks and threaded into window frames; inside wooden beams and baseboards and stashed within a building’s foundation itself; surreptitiously attached to security cameras; wired into ceiling panels and walls; and secretly implanted into the backseat of cars and in their window panels, instrument panels, and dashboards.

                              <span>UPDATE: EA&#x27;s servers are coming back online after an outage that lasted roughly two hours. Players are now able to log into Ultimate Team.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret we&#x27;re big fans of PowerWash Simulator here at Eurogamer which, for me, makes this hour-long development deep dive video something of a must-watch. 


I&#x27;ve often wondered while playing whether certain objects auto-complete faster than others. If you&#x27;re yet to try PowerWash yourself, it&#x27;s worth knowing the game will, after you clean a certain amount of surface area, auto-complete the rest of the object in question. (This also provides a nice &#x27;ding&#x27; sound.)


This subject is one of many covered in the developer video, which is ostensibly about how levels in the game are created but also delves into thoughts on dirt design, parkour, and the game&#x27;s lack of fall damage.

Custom-made trombones? Check. An actual brass trombone? Check.

Microsoft says this controller is inspired by &quot;geode crystals&quot;, and that it &quot;finds the perfect balance between striking and subdued.&quot;

However, the teen did plead guilty to breaching bail conditions, Eurogamer understands. 


In a statement to Eurogamer this afternoon, the City of London Police&#x27;s Cyber Crime Unit acknowledged the individual had appeared in court over the weekend - and was now being held at a youth detention centre.

                              <span>Yves Guillemot, boss and co-founder of Ubisoft, has raised eyebrows for his comments on the need for &quot;a little friction&quot; in game development. 


Discussing his company&#x27;s troubles with harassment and workplace toxicity, as highlighted by a number of employees since the summer of 2020, Guillemot told La Presse that Ubisoft had been &quot;progressing at a good pace&quot; in dealing with its issues - but that &quot;creating a video game is not easy&quot; and sometimes created &quot;a lot of tension&quot;. 


&quot;Techniques must be put in place to ensure that everyone succeeds in finding their place,&quot; Guillemot continued, now discussing the games industry in general. &quot;To create, you need a little friction, because everyone has to succeed in getting their idea across. It&#x27;s a job that brings a lot of rewards when you succeed, but it&#x27;s difficult.&quot;

Both Nioh games were originally released on PS4 and PC, but never on Microsoft&#x27;s console.


Speaking to VGC, Nioh director Fumihiko Yasuda downplayed any possibility of the game coming to Xbox.

                              <span>Yesterday, as part of The Last of Us day, we were treated to the first full trailer for the franchise&#x27;s upcoming HBO adaptation, starring Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This trailer didn&#x27;t have any real dialogue between the characters (there were plenty of tense looks and some furtive Shh-ing), but it still offered an evocative picture of the world that HBO has created for its TV audience. You can see this trailer for yourself below. 


Right off the bat, it is clear HBO has taken this adaptation seriously, with several scenes looking like they have been pulled straight from Naughty Dog&#x27;s video game series. There is a lot to unpack in the minute and half or so of footage, so let&#x27;s dive on in.

                              <span>One GTA Online player has become a billionaire in-game, nine years after the game released.

Reddit user jamcar70 shared their impressive milestone on the game&#x27;s subreddit, to a stunned response.

The feat took jamcar70 two years, 34 days and four hours of playtime to achieve, as shown on their screenshot to prove their in-game savings.

                              <span>Early access roguelike Darkest Dungeon 2 is getting a major update which reworks the game&#x27;s progression system - and also resets some player stats, developer Red Hook Games has warned.


The Altar of Hope update adds a new type of reward - Candles of Hope - which you can earn and then spend on various attributes which should make future missions safer for your party.


As you&#x27;d expect, the bigger the danger, the bigger reward in terms of Candles bagged at the end. Missions will offer more Candles the further you manage to progress, but suffer a wipe and you&#x27;ll see your Candle hoard penalised.

                              <span>Tactics Ogre Reborn producer Hiroaki Kato didn&#x27;t consider the HD-2D style for the remake, despite its use in this year&#x27;s Triangle Strategy and Live A Live.


Speaking to IGN, Kato admitted he likes the style but the 2D pixel art of the original has been retained instead.


&quot;No, we didn&#x27;t think about making it HD-2D,&quot; he said. &quot;We kind of played with the idea of making it 3D, but what we were really thinking about was, &#x27;What are the major parts about this game that are really appealing to everybody?&#x27; And in the 2D original, it was really well done pixel art, so we realised that we couldn&#x27;t have a Tactics Ogre game without this really high-quality, awesome looking 2D pixel art. So to bring that sort of resolution and that sort of fidelity to new hardware and new technology was a lot of effort. But yeah, I think we did it.&quot;

One nice to have but unexpected new feature is the ability to disable critical commentary. Here&#x27;s the option in the main game settings:


Checking this box means the commentators won&#x27;t point out how bad you&#x27;re doing during gameplay, but will say all the other normal stuff they say during a match.

ReImagine, as the unofficial fan server was known, has since been shut down.


Atlus&#x27;s MMO was first released in Japan in 2007 and had players exploring a post-apocalyptic Tokyo. North American (2008) and European (2009) releases followed, but the game was officially shut down in 2016.

Along with this news, we also have a breakdown of his moveset. 


This will include fart bombs (of course) and a move called &quot;Meeseeks and Destroys&quot; which summons a meeseek that will then attack by running forward and deploying an uppercut or by wielding a golfclub. Lastly, Rick will be able to aim and place two portals thanks to his &quot;Basrick Portal Theory&quot; move.

                              <span>Bandai Namco Europe has launched its own music label to release soundtracks from its most popular games.


The news comes alongside the release of the soundtrack to JRPG Tales of Arise, available from today.


That follows the release of Elden Ring&#x27;s soundtrack, which was made available on streaming services earlier this month.

                              <span>Take-Two Interactive, publisher of GTA and Borderlands, has pulled out of a development and publishing agreement with People Can Fly, the company behind Outriders and Gears of War Judgment.


A financial update from People Can Fly states that Take-Two is ditching the project after two years of work - but that development will still continue. 


Codenamed Project Dagger, the game is said to be a new action adventure IP, which People Can Fly now retains the rights to. It sounds like Take-Two had the option to purchase these rights - which it has not exercised.

The report recommends that regulators should 1) enforce minimum security standards for manufacturers of IoT devices, 2) incentivize higher levels of security through public contracting, and 3) try to align IoT standards internationally (for example, international guidance on handling connected devices that stop receiving security updates)...</span>

                              <span>Today is The Last of Us day, an annual occasion formerly known as Outbreak Day that marks the in-universe date in which the Cordyceps infection spread throughout humanity. 


This year, to celebrate the occasion, Naughty Dog and HBO have released a new trailer for their upcoming TV adaptation, which stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. 


This new trailer gives us all a closer look at Ellie and Joel in action as they make their way across America. Along with seeing more of the two protagonists, we now also have a better, but still brief look at the series&#x27; infected Clickers - complete with their unmistakable and haunting noises. Other characters such as Ellie&#x27;s friend Riley also make a showing. You can see the trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>Battlefield 2042 Season 2 continues today with the arrival of update 2.1, which most notably reworks the (appropriately named) map Renewal. 


DICE has taken the decision &quot;to competely remove certain sections of the map&quot; which it has decided broke the game&#x27;s &quot;flow&quot; or were simply &quot;too far away&quot;. 


Getting around the game will be quicker too - as Battlefield adds the Polaris RZR buggy as an in-world vehicle. To my eyes, it looks like a cross between a tank and a golf cart. Why not?

The new studio will be based in Helsinki and led by Marko Lastikka as director, formerly of Zynga and EA.


The studio will create &quot;world class&quot; original games without ads or in-app purchases, reports Engadget.

Their latest mod is Trombone Champ, the surprise Steam hit of last week.

Raicuparta shared a video of himself attempting Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony in VR. The display inside the headset shows a first-person view of the titular Trombone Champ and the gameplay screen is projected in front of you. The game is played with motion controls, meaning you have to extend and retract your arm instead of moving a mouse back and forth for the correct notes.

Next year will see the LACC&#x27;s two main halls divided into separate spaces for industry attendees and those attending as fans - similar to how the various halls are separated at Gamescom.

                              <span>The ever-expanding world of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will receive one of its final major updates tomorrow, as it adds a final set of puzzle tombs via patch 1.6.1. 


This activity was originally added to the game earlier this year, and adds a new storyline expanding upon the series&#x27; mysterious precursor Isu race, doled out by exploring a string of fun puzzle dungeons. 


It also allows for Eivor to come face-to-face with a series of British figures from history before her time - such as the ancient queen of the Iceni, Boudicca. Fans have some interesting theories on who may pop up in this concluding set of dungeons (including someone perhaps more from Assassin&#x27;s Creed lore than actual history itself).

                              <span>An upcoming book focusing on all things Sable will be released to celebrate the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary. 


Sable: Design Works will be the first instalment from publisher Lost in Cult&#x27;s new series of indie-focussed art books. This particular release, which is due to launch in the second quarter of 2023, will feature interviews from those at developer Shedworks, as well as a &quot;region-by-region insight&quot; into the world of Midden and its art.


The book itself will be split into two different sections, one that &quot;charts the development of Sable from its early concept and prototype, through its production, to launch&quot; and one that focuses exclusively on the artwork and visuals.

                              <span>Certain Affinity, the studio long-rumoured to be building a battle royale mode for Halo Infinite, has offered up a fresh hint of its plans for the project. 


The developer - which has assisted with work on the Halo series from as far back as Halo 2 - was reported to be working on a new battle royale mode back in January. The following month, it issued a statement to confirm it was &quot;deepening&quot; its relationship with franchise holder 343 Industries. 


Now, Certain Affinity exec Paul Sams has said the studio&#x27;s still-technically-unannounced project had been in the works for more than two years, with almost 100 staff working on it.

Marvel exec Bill Rosemann set the record straight as part of a GamesIndustry.biz interview, which comes after a succession of announcements for upcoming Iron Man, Black Panther and Wolverine  games.


&quot;The world is, amazingly, very familiar and accepting of the multiverse,&quot; Rosemann said. &quot;We have all these different realities. Now they&#x27;re all real, and we want to give everyone the freedom to tell their story.

The unamed teen has been charged with two counts of computer misuse, as well as two counts of breaching bail conditions. 


These latter charges likely refer to the teen&#x27;s previous run-in with police over hacking charges - when they were suspected of breaching both Microsoft and Samsung earlier in the year.

But what if you were to throw a load of zombie-like monsters into this experience, and then proceed to turn out the lights, leaving the exit near impossible to find? Well, one developer has decided to answer that question in its upcoming game: The Store is closed.


The Store is Closed is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games&#x27; The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy (thanks, PCGamesN).

As with Team Ninja&#x27;s previous Nioh games, Wo Long is a Soulslike game that thrives on challenge. Many players subsequently feel the games are too difficult and inaccessible.


Speaking to MP1st, producer Masaaki Yamagiwa defended Team Ninja&#x27;s decision to stick with one difficulty.

                              <span>Classic Halo 3 multiplayer map The Pit is on the way to Halo Infinite, Microsoft has announced.

                              <span>There&#x27;s an Onimusha anime in the works for Netflix, Capcom has announced.


This adaptation of Capcom&#x27;s dormant samurai action series is produced by Sublimation Inc., the same company that handled the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma series that was streamed on Netflix in 2020, and is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer, 13 Assassins).


Details are scarce, but Capcom said the anime has &quot;3DCG&quot; animated characters with hand-drawn backgrounds. Protagonist Miyamoto Musashi is modeled on Toshihiro Mifune, the Japanese actor famous for appearing in multiple Akira Kurosawa films who died 25 years ago.

The Kubernetes in-tree storage plugin to Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration infrastructure has already been beta since v1.17. CSI migration was introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.14.
Since then, SIG Storage and other Kubernetes special interest groups are working to ensure feature stability and compatibility in preparation for CSI Migration feature to go GA.
SIG Storage is excited to announce that the core CSI Migration feature is generally available in Kubernetes v1.25 release!
SIG Storage wrote a blog post in v1.23 for CSI Migration status update which discussed the CSI migration status for each storage driver. It has been a while and this article is intended to give a latest status update on each storage driver for their CSI Migration status in Ku…</span>

The new initiative, entitled Screen Culture 2033, will &quot;advocate for the value of the full breadth of screen culture, including video games and interactive work&quot;.

Describing screen culture as &quot;young, dynamic and expanding&quot;, the BFI says &quot;it presents a wider screen landscape that encompasses film, television, digital media, extended reality (XR) and video games&quot; and says &quot;it has become the dominant means of communication, information and storytelling for Gen Z and beyond&quot;.

Originally, the character model and voice for Judgement character Kyohei Hamura was based upon Japanese musician and actor Pierre Taki. Shortly after his drugs arrest, however, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios scrambled to replace him with the voice and likeness of Japanese actor Miou Tanaka instead.

Modder Timo 654, however, has brought Taki back to life - so to speak - by meticulously restoring the original voice lines and likeness.

                              <span>Nier Automata&#x27;s spin-off anime series, Nier Automata Ver 1.1a, will premiere in January 2023.

Whilst we&#x27;ve yet to hear of a definitive date, creator Yoko Taro was at least able to confirm the release window during Aniplex Online Fest, which took place over the weekend.

Interestingly, Taro also revealed that due to the differences between storytelling via games and traditional mediums - and despite Aniplex&#x27;s hopes of a faithful retelling of the game - the anime&#x27;s story will differ.

                              <span>The Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 beta has hit a new concurrent peak of nearly 170,000 players on PC, making it one of the most played games on Steam right now.

According to SteamDB, the beta is currently sporting more concurrent players than Team Fortress 2, Destiny 2, GTA 5, and even Cyberpunk 2077, which has seen a boost in its own player numbers recently, too. 

With an all-time concurrent peak of 168,330 players (at the time of writing, anyway; it&#x27;s been increasing steadily all weekend), that means it&#x27;s already beaten the concurrent records for games like Left 4 Dead 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, The Division, FIFA 22, and Borderlands 2.

Twitterer Shinobi602 - a games industry brand manager - found themselves intrigued enough by the sci-fi horror&#x27;s most recent promotional video that they texted the number that pops up in the latest trailer.

After texting the number, Shinobi received a mysterious video response. The secretive teaser flashes words like &quot;secrets, answers, ARCAS, lies&quot; and ends with a date: 29th September.

We also discovered that spin-off The Witcher: Blood Origin will premier &quot;this December&quot;, which is set to star Minnie Driver as the Narrator.

Bandai Namco was originally forced to shutter the PC PvP servers for all Dark Souls games back in January following &quot;reports of an issue with online servers&quot;. Although the publisher described the situation as &quot;temporary&quot;, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3&#x27;s servers finally coming back online at the end of August… and going down again earlier this week.

On 21st September, Bandai Namco said &quot;there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls 3 online play via the Steam platform&quot; and revealed that it was &quot;investigating the source of the problem&quot;, but the servers remained offline for several days.

                              <span>It&#x27;s weekend two of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 beta - and now PC, PlayStation and Xbox players are all getting stuck in, cheaters have entered the battlefield.

And, in response, console players are disabling crossplay in a bid to avoid matching up with those on PC - the platform believed to have the most trouble with hackers.

Knight&#x27;s departure from Twitch means the firm has lost its chief content officer, chief operating officer, and Knight&#x27;s position in the last year alone (thanks, Bloomberg).

35 per cent of young girls also reported that their &quot;self-esteen is negatively impacted after seeing a lack of diversity in characters and avatars&quot;.

Ninja Theory was named by GLHF as a company that utilises the services of Altered AI, a tech firm that supports studios in creating &quot;compelling, professional voice performances&quot; via AI rather than professional – and real – voice actors. 

The report stopped short of revealing the minutiae of the arrangement, however, stating that &quot;the details of their partnership are under wraps&quot;.

                              <span>PUBG Mobile has released a new anti-cheat system that it says has already cut cheating by half.

Developer Krafton says the system, called Fog of War, &quot;helps mask the movements of other players from cheaters using x-ray vision/wall hacks&quot;, and states that during the testing period, cheating fell by 62 per cent in &quot;certain regions&quot;.  

&quot;The first of its kind in mobile gaming, Fog of War is an advanced anti-cheat system that limits the game information a player receives, reducing their ability to see players out of their field of view or through walls and objects,&quot; Krafton explains.

                              <span>Okay, it’s an obscure threat. But people are researching it:
Our models and experimental results in a controlled lab setting show it is possible to reconstruct and recognize with over 75 percent accuracy on-screen texts that have heights as small as 10 mm with a 720p webcam.” That corresponds to 28 pt, a font size commonly used for headings and small headlines.
[…]
Being able to read reflected headline-size text isn’t quite the privacy and security problem of being able to read smaller 9 to 12 pt fonts. But this technique is expected to provide access to smaller font sizes as high-resolution webcams become more common...</span>

                              <span>Sly Cooper developer Sucker Punch has lifted the lid on a new line of merchandise to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary.


This range consists of a Sly plushy (seen in the header image), a print of some anniversary artwork by the original Sly Cooper&#x27;s art director Dev Madan and an anniversary T-shirt.


The artwork is certainly an impressive collection of nostalgia for Sly Cooper fans. Madan has rammed it full of references and Easter eggs from the last 20 years.

                              <span>A fresh batch of freebies has arrived on the Epic Games Store, with this week&#x27;s offerings coming in the form of dinosaur survival adventure Ark: Survival Evolved and the video game adaptation of acclaimed board game Gloomhaven.


This isn&#x27;t Ark: Survival Evolved&#x27;s first outing as an Epic freebie - it was given away in June 2020 - but if you&#x27;re a survival fan who hasn&#x27;t yet given it a look, it&#x27;s still probably worth checking out.


Released back in August 2017 after several years in early access, Ark&#x27;s base game offers a broadly compelling (if rather rickety) blend of dinosaur taming and breeding, base building, and survival meter management, all in service of massive-scale tribal warfare - unless you opt to join a PvE server, in which case your most terrifying foe is usually a pillar. Subsequent expansions, not included with Epic&#x27;s freebie, have upped the sci-fi and fantasy factor, which, if you enjoy the base game&#x27;s rhythms, you might find more to your taste.

It consists of a &quot;video series that aims to magnify Black voices within Xbox to inspire, educate and motivate youth across the US to aspire towards careers in the gaming industry through real-life storytelling from Black leaders and employees across the Xbox ecosystem.&quot;


This sees fourteen Black Xbox employees offering up advice to others that are looking to get into the industry. Each will share insight into their jobs, as well as revealing some of their own career highlights.

Creative director Davide Soliani was initially told Rabbids were not to speak by Ubisoft. However, thanks to some creative manipulation of the rules and a successful bid by Soliani to &quot;gain trust&quot; from Ubisoft, Mario and his Rabbid companions will now talk during their upcoming escapades (thanks, IGN).


Let&#x27;s rewind back to the start to understand how this all came about.

                              <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment has spoken out on what it calls a recent increase in &quot;harassment towards members of our development team&quot;, warning those responsible that it will &quot;take appropriate action to ensure [team members&#x27;] health and safety&quot;.


&quot;Recently, we have seen increased harassment of our development team,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We welcome community input, however, the line between constructive feedback and the harassment of our dev team cannot be crossed.&quot;


&quot;We want to remind our players that we have a zero tolerance policy for threats and the harassment of our developers,&quot; the statement continued. &quot;We will take appropriate action to ensure the healthy and safety of our team&quot;.

                              <span>Neil Druckmann, the man behind the gritty The Last of Us games, has a cameo in the delightful, and comparatively very colourful, Return to Monkey Island. 


Last night, I finished Return to Monkey Island. It was an amazing moment for me, and as I sat watching the credits roll with my heart feeling pleasantly full I saw a name make its way up the screen that I did not expect to see there - Neil Druckmann.


&quot;Neil Druckmann?&quot; my mind tried to compute, as my lips verbalised my amazement. Surely not the Neil Druckmann whose Ellie and Joel can be heard cussing left, right and centre in a game that is definitely not for children.

                              <span>Valve has introduced a new, live, charts page on Steam.


As you may have surmised from the headline already, this page sees all of Steam&#x27;s top games bundled together in one place. It will replace the usual Steam Stats many of you may be familiar with.


&quot;Today we&#x27;re launching Steam Charts, a new section of Steam that is dedicated to showing the most-played and top-selling games on Steam. Including numbers in real time,&quot; Valve said in a statement (thanks, Kotaku).

                              <span>Seven new patent filings from Destiny developer Bungie have been unearthed, predominantly all linked to virtual controls on touch-enabled devices, lending further credence to reports earlier this year that it had a Destiny mobile game in the works.


Those reports first surfaced back in July, when The Game Post, citing a source with knowledge of Chinese mobile developer NetEase&#x27;s plans, claimed the company was collaborating with Bungie to bring a completely new instalment in the Destiny series to mobile - a project said to have already been in development for several years.


It&#x27;s in this context that the seven newly unearthed Bungie patents (as spotted by The Game Post) prove particularly interesting. Almost all the patents, published last week, pertain to the implementation of a virtual controller on touch-enabled devices, with individual filings focusing on state-based action buttons, virtual dynamic ledge grabbing, virtual infinite drag and swipe input, virtual automatic aiming (particularly in relation to an &#x27;isometric/top-down&#x27; perspective), and action charging via virtual buttons.

                              <span>Google&#x27;s Arts and Culture team has created a cute Zelda-like adventure for those looking to further their education on ancient Mesoamerica.


Known as The Descent on the Serpent, this game was made in collaboration with Mexico&#x27;s National Museum of Anthropology (thanks, The Verge). It starts off with the player visiting a museum. However, out of nowhere, the Lord of the Smoking Mirror, Tezcatlipoca, rushes in and steals an artefact on display. 


This clearly can&#x27;t be good news, and soon a talking statue, which is also on display at the museum, asks for your help returning the artefact  before the equinox happens. Of course, you are more than happy to offer your services on this quest as you do &quot;love exploring&quot;. The talking statue then swiftly transports you back in time to ancient Mesoamerica where you need to find 20 icons to return to the city of Chichen Itza.

The initial leaker is known as Teapot and used the account @teapotuberhacker, but the forum believes another user, with the moniker Lily, also had access to this account.


It’s unclear whether this second user has access to any hacked material, though the forum believes this is not the case.

In Kubernetes 1.25, Validation rules for CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) have graduated to Beta!
Validation rules make it possible to declare how custom resources are validated using the Common Expression Language (CEL). For example:
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
 ...
 openAPIV3Schema:
 type: object
 properties:
 spec:
 type: object
 x-kubernetes-validations:
 - rule: &quot;self.minReplicas &lt;&#x3D; self.replicas &amp;&amp; self.replicas &lt;&#x3D; self.maxReplicas&quot;
 message: &quot;replicas should be in the range minReplicas..maxReplicas.&quot;
 properties:
 replicas:
 type: integer
 ...


Validation rules support a wide range of use cases. To get a sense of some of the capabilities, let&#x27;s look at a few examples:

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re discussing video game leaks, following last weekend&#x27;s devastating hack of Rockstar Games which saw almost an hour of in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 footage spilled onto the internet and promptly dissected by the masses.


The sheer fact Rockstar had been hacked in this manner was itself shocking - but the damage felt worse due to the negative comments this work-in-progress content then received. The hack has robbed Rockstar of its oppurtunity to show the game on its own terms - and for what benefit? We discuss.

After that, we turn our attention to the YouTuber who accidentally outed themselves as being behind an &quot;insider&quot; Twitter account after posting under-wraps information they had been given by Ubisoft. Join Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan for their thoughts.

                              <span>As Microsoft starts to feel more heat from regulatory bodies over its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, CEO Satya Nadella has said he&#x27;s &quot;very confident” the deal will go through.


Governmental scrutiny of Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition has grown in recent weeks, with the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority announcing it was moving to a more in-depth &quot;phase 2&quot; of its investigation, having determined the acquisition would give rise to the &quot;realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services.&quot;


Sony, too, has grown increasingly vocal over the proposed deal, particularly as it pertains to potential console exclusivity around the likes of Call of Duty. Early this month, for instance, PlayStation head Jim Ryan called Microsoft&#x27;s reassurances that the hugely popular shooter would remain on PS5 post-acquisition &quot;inadequate&quot;.

                              <span>One of the most integral parts to any good FIFA game, aside from the football, is the soundtrack.


A running theme around the FIFA community is that every new game introduced players to their next favourite tune. And as the years go by, the tracks serve as a nostalgia trip to playing FIFA after a long day of school or work. 


Now EA has revealed the full track list for FIFA 23, and you can stream it all now in a dedicated Spotify playlist.

Bloody Ties - the first of two bits of story DLC currently confirmed as part of Dying Light 2&#x27;s five year journey of post-launch support - takes players to The Carnage Hall, an old opera house said to be the &quot;epicentre of death, wealth and absolute splendour&quot;. Here, they&#x27;ll find &quot;challenges and quests, surprising new weapon types, character interactions, and discoveries to uncover.&quot;


This initial bit of story DLC was originally expected to launch in June but was delayed to September for additional development. That date then slipped again, with Techland announcing a 13th October release date as August came to an end.

This time around, the collaboration will be in Sheeran&#x27;s area of expertise.

                              <span>PC players are rushing to find ways to download a popular Grand Theft Auto 4 mod compilation after it was taken down following a copyright infringement notice to the hosting site which provided access to the project. 


Grand Theft Auto IV - Definitive Edition is a project which complied a number of mods which aimed to enhance and update the game to run on modern PCs (thanks, PC Gamer). 


The game was last updated by Rockstar in 2020, when the developer removed the archaic Games for Windows Live DRM after it was shut down by Microsoft. However, this also had the unfortunate effect of disabling access to online multiplayer and leaderboards, which were run through the GFWL backend.

This listing (spotted by PSU) is for a scriptwriter and reads: &quot;Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience&quot;.


The post goes on to state that Ubisoft intends to &quot;keep the spirit and themes of the original game&quot; with this remake while &quot;exploring [its] characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable.&quot;

If you&#x27;re yet to try it, Spiritfarer is a memorable and moving adventure game where you shepard a crew of lost souls into the after life, while slowly upgrading your boat.


In a nutshell, it&#x27;s a &quot;cosy management game about dying&quot;, and one of my favourite games from 2020. If this news means more people get to play it - all the better!

The screenshot reel from a pre-release build of the game was found in the long-sought after 1996 Nintendo Company Report. 


The report, which has been carefully scanned and uploaded here, includes the standard yearly company round-up, plus some accompanying images of Nintendo&#x27;s star roster and various consoles including the Nintendo 64 and the destined for failure Virtual Boy.

Lenneth is an enhanced version of the original 1999 PS1 RPG Valkyrie Profile that was released on PSP in 2007 - its first release in the PAL region.


It was set for a re-release alongside the forthcoming action-RPG Valkyrie Elysium, available both separately and included in the deluxe edition, but now will arrive a little later.

                              <span>Return to Monkey Island has just come out, and the reception to it has been overwhelmingly positive. This reception has, of course, not been missed by those at Lucasfilm Games, or more specifically, Craig Derrick who worked with Ron Gilbert and co to get the game released. 


Now, Derrick has shared his delight at all the positive feedback for Return to Monkey Island in a heartfelt Twitter thread. 


This alone is nice but not especially newsworthy. However, at the end of his thread, Derrick wrote some simple words that have caught the world&#x27;s eye: &quot;I&#x27;ll be standing by when it&#x27;s time to go BACK TO THE MANSION!&quot;

                              <span>The adorable fox-themed Tunic is making the leap to PlayStation and Switch soon. Ahead of these releases, its developer has shared some behind the scenes titbits about the game&#x27;s manual, including how a real one was made to ensure authenticity within the game


Sharing on the PlayStation Blog, Tunic&#x27;s lead developer Andrew Shouldice expressed his love for old-school game&#x27;s manuals. &quot;The more I thought about it though, the more I realised that my love for this kind of mystery came not just from the games, but from the manuals they were packaged with,&quot; Shouldice wrote, stating he would &quot;pore over these documents endlessly&quot;.


Such was Shouldice&#x27;s love for these manuals, he decided to incorporate one into Tunic&#x27;s gameplay. In this case, the player picks up pages for the manual as they make their way through the game&#x27;s mysterious word. These are then pieced together, allowing the player to uncover more of Tunic&#x27;s many (many) secrets.

                              <span>The Grand Theft Auto community has started to map out the game world of the next GTA game using leaks as their source. 


We know very little about the next game from official channels, but the huge leak on Monday gave us our biggest (albeit unfinished) look at the title. 


Moreover, with various reports reporting on the game&#x27;s location, characters and gameplay elements, there appears to be enough to go on to start the mapping process.

A new update has been released for the game, focused predominantly on changes to the Pearl map.


Yet nestled in the patch notes is a social update to add a &quot;disruptive gameplay-based behaviour indicator&quot;.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Nvidia announced its next series of GeForce RTX cards - and raised eyebrows at how much some of them will cost.


At the top end, the RTX 4090 will cost an eye-watering $1599. The RTX 4080 16GB will cost $1199, while the RTX 4080 12GB will cost $899.


Many had hoped for lower prices - but, according to Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, these costs reflect a world where Moore&#x27;s law - where performance is doubled for half the price every two years - is now &quot;dead&quot;.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s long-awaited new chapter is getting closer to its release - but it could have once been very different.
What we&#x27;re getting is a DLC package known as the Winters Expansion, which will include a third-person mode for the base game, a rework of the Mercenaries Mode which will introduce new playable characters such as Lady Dimitrescu, and the new story-based chapter known as Shadows of Rose.


Shadows of Rose will put Ethan Winters&#x27; daughter into the spotlight as she makes her way through the  consciousness of the Megamycete. This, Capcom has said, will conclude the Winters family story. However, Rose was not always going to be the focus of this story DLC. Instead, Capcom also had ideas for a Chris Redfield focused expansion.

                              <span>Turn on your Xbox late at night and what do you hear? A booming animated Xbox logo, probably - especially if you&#x27;ve had the volume up on one of your TV&#x27;s apps earlier in the day.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s head of PlayStation Indies Shuhei Yoshida has said PS Plus should be used by publishers to manage the lifecycle of a game.

Alongside DLSS anti-aliasing and upscaling, Asobo says Sim Update 10 should deliver &quot;stability, performance, and memory usage&quot; improvements for those using Flight Simulator&#x27;s in-development Direct X12 support - although it notes the new memory allocator will only be activated once Nvidia&#x27;s next GPU driver is released.


Elsewhere in today&#x27;s update, moving boats in the world now have a wake effect on PC, there&#x27;s a new cloud layer system - said to provide &quot;more vertical precision at low altitudes to better reflect the various cloud altitudes and thickness close to the ground&quot; - plus a number of quality of life features for Flight Simulator&#x27;s VFR map.

                              <span>Developer Jupiter has unveiled an eighth mainline instalment for its mighty Picross puzzle series on Switch, its big new addition being multiplayer support for up to four player when it launches next week. Furthermore, multiplayer and touchscreen support are reportedly being added to all previous Switch instalments at the same time.


Picross S8, as this newest entry is known, follows the same familiar formula as its predecessors - each stage requiring players to complete a picture on a grid by solving numerical clues indicating which squares must be filled in - but adds a bit of spice to proceedings by letting four players put their heads together to tackle each challenge.


According to the official Picross website, it&#x27;s local multiplayer only (the trailer suggests there&#x27;s a score-based component despite everyone working co-operatively to complete the same puzzle), and each player will need their own controller to participate.

                              <span>Gearbox has called the release of Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands a &quot;great victory&quot; for the studio, saying its success means it &quot;now clearly [has] a new franchise on its hands&quot;, with more &quot;experiences&quot; already in development.


Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands released back in March, taking the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2&#x27;s much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep and building it out into a full-length game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


It was generally well-received by critics on release - Eurogamer called it &quot;endearing&quot; despite its &quot;hodgepodge design&quot; - and it&#x27;s apparently been enough of a commercial success that Gearbox is now eager to do more.

                              <span>A month after Dark Souls 3&#x27;s Steam servers were finally bought online following more than seven months of downtime, they&#x27;re offline again, with publisher Bandai Namco confirming it&#x27;s currently &quot;investigating&quot; the issue.


The Dark Souls server woes began in January, when Bandai Namco was forced to disable servers for all Dark Souls games following reports of serious security concerns. Although the publisher described the situation as &#x27;temporary&#x27; at the time, it took over seven months for a fix to be deployed, with Dark Souls 3&#x27;s servers finally coming back online at the end of August.


Unfortunately, the celebrations have been short-lived, and the game&#x27;s PvP servers are, as of yesterday, once again unavailable, preventing players from accessing any of its online features.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve long felt miffed by the Xbox Elite controller&#x27;s lack of chameleon-like powers, you&#x27;re (sort of) in luck; among other things, September&#x27;s newly released Xbox update gives Elite owners the option to imbue its central button with the glowing LED colour of their dreams.


Customisation options for the Elite Wireless Controller Series 2&#x27;s Xbox button can be found in the latest version of the Xbox Accessories app on console and PC while a controller is connected. Here, users can visit the Colour tab to tinker with the Xbox button&#x27;s brightness, or use the menu sliders to pick one out of a possible 16 million hues.


In addition to button customisation, September&#x27;s Xbox update brings a revamp to the &#x27;My games and apps&#x27; Full library view on consoles, streamlining access to all games available to install and play. Furthermore, &#x27;All games&#x27; now displays every title a user has access to, including those on Game Pass, EA Access, and those claimed via Games with Gold.

                              <span>A cheat seller being sued by Bungie has launched a remarkable countersuit which claims Bungie hacked it.


The claim follows months of legal back and forth between cheat seller AimJunkies and Destiny developer Bungie, which has seen the former accused of both trademark and copyright infringement. 


AimJunkies has previously attempted to shrug off these claims, but has now gone one further. As reported by Torrentfreak, the cheat seller has now launched a countersuit which alleges Bungie accessed its computers for anti-cheat purposes via &quot;clandestine surveillance&quot; - effectively, that Bungie hacked it.

Call of the Sea - which initially launched for PC and consoles at the tail-end of 2020 - tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One&#x27;s Cissy Jones), as she investigates a beautiful South Pacific island, circa 1934, in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a captivating, often ingenious blend of story, exploration, and puzzling that successfully hits some powerful emotional beats even as it tips gently into cosmic weirdness.

It&#x27;s a music rhythm game where you play a trombone. Sounds simple, right?

You&#x27;d be wrong. Even though there&#x27;s some of the most famous classical pieces included, like Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony and Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, and even the national anthem, no amount of music knowledge will save you here.

                              <span>Embracer co-founder Lars Wingefors has spoken to investors about the release of Saints Row, admitting he had hoped the game would have received a &quot;greater reception&quot;.


Wingefors, whose company owns Saints Row developer Volition, acknowledged that views on the series&#x27; reboot had been &quot;polarised&quot; following its bug-laced release - in Eurogamer&#x27;s Saints Row review, Vikki Blake noted that its &#x27;Unto the Breach&#x27; mission was unplayable for her.


&quot;There are a lot of things that could be said and details around it. I&#x27;m happy to see a lot of gamers and fans happy. At the same time I&#x27;m a bit sad to see fans also not happy,&quot; Lars told investors (via Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo).

                              <span>Afghanistan has become the latest in a string of countries to ban PUBG, with the game now expected to be made unplayable in the country within the next 90 days. 


Writing on Twitter, the director of the ruling Taliban government&#x27;s media and information centre stated that the game would be blocked, alongside social app TikTok, for its effects on young people (thanks, PCGamesN). 


India, Pakistan, China and Jordan have also previously banned PUBG, whose mobile version specifically became particularly popular in these countries.

                              <span>BBC Earth and Minecraft have teamed up to create five free worlds based on new documentary series Frozen Planet 2.


For the first time ever, it offers a new perspective: players can explore the worlds as animals such as a penguin, bumblebee, and polar bear.


Players are tasked with documenting key animal behaviour to inform environmental research, mimicking that of natural history film-making researchers.

                              <span>Nvidia is releasing Portal with RTX, which will see the game&#x27;s graphics reimagined &quot;with full ray tracing and entirely new art evocative of the original.&quot;


In a detailed blog post, Nvidia stated that &quot;full ray tracing&quot; will mean every level will be transformed. Light will now bounce around the settings, and &quot;be affected by the scene&#x27;s geometry and materials&quot;. Meanwhile, where shadows are being cast, these will be &quot;pixel perfect&quot;.


&quot;Portal&#x27;s unique selling point is the ability to take anything through a portal, and see through them, something that hadn&#x27;t been done before its release,&quot; Nvidia elaborated. &quot;With ray tracing, light can pass through portals, too. Even the light from the moving High Energy Pellets will cast through portals, causing shadows to shift in step.&quot; You can see a little preview of Portal with RTX below.

                              <span>UPDATE: Warner Bros. Games has responded to Eurogamer with a statement in response to previous investigations into sexual harassment at the studio. Below in full: 
&quot;Investigations found there was no evidence substantiating the allegations of this former employee who resigned in 2019. We stand against all forms of harassment and take any allegation extremely seriously. We support those who have concerns they wish to raise. We therefore took the necessary time to thoroughly investigate allegations at Rocksteady Studios with the utmost integrity. 
&quot;An external, independent law firm conducted a full and thorough investigation, including interviewing current and former employees, not only researching past allegations, but also examining the current culture of the studio. Furthermore, a Warner Bros. Discovery (then Warner Media) People Relations team, independent of the games division, diligently researched and investigated any allegations raised.

Perfect Head would have allowed players to scan a face into the game using the camera on a Game Boy, which could then be mapped onto a multiplayer character&#x27;s head. The feature was complete and functional, but was removed from the game for its release. 

In an 2020 interview conducted by our own Wesley Yin-Poole, several of the developers revealed it had been removed at Nintendo&#x27;s request due to the recent Columbine High School massacre and concerns over the feature&#x27;s potential uses.

                              <span>A new and detailed report by Bloomberg has highlighted the numbers of children who stream on Twitch, and the number of accounts linked to adult predators who follow and interact with them.


Research includes various examples of children being asked by adult users to engage in explicit or inappropriate activities and perform dances or &quot;dares&quot; while live-streaming. After said streams have ended, the recordings are often viewed by hundreds of other accounts - far more than expected for small channels their size.


The report suggests this is due to &quot;hundreds&quot; of accounts believed to be used by predators, which have collated follower lists each with &quot;more than 1000 kids on their following lists&quot;.

This series of images was shared on Reddit by user M_S_1.


M_S_1 said they took inspiration from the featured games&#x27; concept art for their covers, calling it &quot;a bit more timeless&quot; to work from. &quot;A character render with modern graphics would look pretty jarring for the era,&quot; they explained.

                              <span>Twitch has declined to change the revenue split for streamers, despite over 22k votes on its UserVoice platform.


The revenue split between Twitch and streamers has long been an issue, with many claiming the current 50/50 split is stifling the growth of smaller channels.


The UserVoice post, begun by streamer SaltyWyvern in 2020, became the most voted issue on the platform as it requested Twitch change the revenue split to 70/30 (like main rival YouTube). This has now been closed by Twitch.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s first beta weekend is done and dusted, and developer Infinity Ward has updated players on changes they can expect to see when it returns.


The highlight here is Infinity Ward&#x27;s explanation for Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s divisive mini-map, which has come under fire from some players for failing to provide enough information on enemy players.


Unlike some previous Call of Duty games, Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s mini-map only shows enemy player dots when a UAV is active. This means it does not display red dots when enemy players sprint or fire their weapons.

                              <span>Call of Duty developer Infinity Ward has been criticised for its use of the Arabic language and cultural misrepresentation in Warzone 2.


Vlambeer co-founder Rami Ismail was among those who spoke out about the game, and who shared a detailed thread of criticism posted on ResetEra.


&quot;Why don&#x27;t you for once just hire some Arabs [and] locals to ensure the places you seem to insist you gotta blow us up in would at least pass the critical gaze of say, a three-year-old,&quot; Ismail wrote on Twitter. &quot;This is embarrassing to game development as a whole.&quot;

                              <span>Co-operative time-travel puzzler The Past Within - the latest entry in developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s wonderfully sinister puzzle-adventure series - finally has a release date and will be coming to PC, Mac, iOS, and Android on 2nd November.


Developer Rusty Lake has released 14 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner to date - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - each delivering a deliciously surreal, narratively interconnected slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant.


The Past Within is Rusty Lake&#x27;s first attempt at a co-operative adventure, expanding the series&#x27; familiar formula, both spacially and temporally, as two players work together across different timelines - one located in the past, the other in the future - to solve the mysteries surrounding recurring series character Albert Vanderboom.

                              <span>Over the weekend, Rockstar faced a massive leak that saw numerous screenshots and videos taken from GTA 6&#x27;s development show up online with missing assets and features.


On seeing this leaked footage, some corners of the internet decided to use it as ammunition to criticise Rockstar&#x27;s unfinished work.


&quot;If you knew how game development goes, you&#x27;d know that visuals are one of the first things done. This game is four years into planning and development. What you see is almost exactly what you will get. The next year is mission coding and debugging. All backend stuff. It does look ass,&quot; claimed one Twitter user.

The new policy prohibits streaming of gambling sites that include slots, roulette, or dice games that aren&#x27;t licensed in the US or &quot;other jurisdictions that provide sufficient consumer protection&quot; from 18th October.


This follows strike threats from some of the biggest Twitch streamers after former Team Liquid member ItsSliker admitted to have scammed viewers and fellow streamers out of $200k to fund his gambling addiction.

Allen gained brief internet fame by leaking details of Ubisoft&#x27;s various Assassin&#x27;s Creed announcements - details which he had been given by Ubisoft itself to prepare content while under embargo.


But his identity as &quot;TheRealInsider&quot; was exposed over the weekend, when Allen replied to a tweet from a fan from his main account instead. Allen then swiftly deleted the tweet, the insider account, and subsequently issued a brief Twitter statement saying sorry.

                              <span>This is a fascinating glimpse of the future of automatic cheating detection in sports:
Maybe you heard about the truly insane false-start controversy in track and field? Devon Allen—a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles—was disqualified from the 110-meter hurdles at the World Athletics Championships a few weeks ago for a false start.
Here’s the problem: You can’t see the false start. Nobody can see the false start. By sight, Allen most definitely does not leave before the gun.
But here’s the thing: World Athletics has determined that it is not possible for someone to push off the block within a tenth of a second of the gun without false starting. They have science that shows it is beyond human capabilities to react that fast. Of course there are those (I’m among them) who would tell you that’s nonsense, that’s pseudoscience, there’s no way that they can limit human capabilities like that. There is science that shows it is humanly impossible to hit a fastball. There was once science that showed human beings could not run a four-minute mile...</span>

Kubernetes v1.25, released earlier this month, introduced a new feature
that lets your cluster expand storage volumes, even when access to those
volumes requires a secret (for example: a credential for accessing a SAN fabric)
to perform node expand operation. This new behavior is in alpha and you
must enable a feature gate (CSINodeExpandSecret) to make use of it.
You must also be using CSI
storage; this change isn&#x27;t relevant to storage drivers that are built in to Kubernetes.
To turn on this new, alpha feature, you enable the CSINodeExpandSecret feature
gate for the kube-apiserver and kubelet, which turns on a mechanism to send secretRef
configuration as part of NodeExpansion by the CSI drivers thus make use of
the same to perfor…</span>

                              <span>Star Citizen, the controversial space sim from developer Cloud Imperium Games, has now raised more than half a billion dollars in funding from backers.


Star Citizen&#x27;s exceedingly lengthy development is well-documented, with the game still in alpha over a decade after production began. And while it&#x27;s attracted some private funding in that time, the overwhelming bulk has come via crowdfunding, beginning with a successful $2m USD Kickstarter in 2012 and ballooning from there.


As of today, Star Citizen has amassed $500,075,150 USD in crowdfunding from a total of 4,096,384 backers, according to the official Roberts Space Industries website. Its previous major milestone of $400m USD raised was reached last November, meaning it&#x27;s taken a further ten months to accrue an additional $100m.

As per an update shared with developers, which did not provide an explanation for the impending price hike, Apple said the move will impact all tiers of its App Store pricing chart in the following areas: Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Vietnam, and all territories that use the euro currency. 


When the pricing changes come into effect on 5th October, App Store items previously priced at €0.99 will, for instance, increase to €1.19, while apps formerly costing €9.99 will rise to €11.99.

                              <span>If FIFA 23&#x27;s 700+ plus real-life football clubs somehow aren&#x27;t enough to be getting on with, it looks like you&#x27;ll soon be able to sling a decidedly more imaginary one onto the pile, with all signs pointing to an appearance from Ted Lasso&#x27;s AFC Richmond in this year&#x27;s game.


Hints of an impending crossover with the award-winning Apple TV+ comedy series first emerged last week, when a listing for AFC Richmond - the fictional London team managed by Ted Lasso in the show - briefly appeared on EA&#x27;s FIFA ratings database  before being removed.


That might have been the end of it, but now the official Ted Lasso Twitter account has shared an image showing what appears to be Ted Lasso actor Jason Sudeikis, albeit from behind, ensconced in the FIFA team&#x27;s facial capture rig - used to digitise the real-world likeness of players (and, for the first time this year, managers) for use in-game.

                              <span>Earlier today, Nvidia finally revealed the new RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 video cards, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. We&#x27;ve been hands-on with the RTX 4090 for the last few days and we&#x27;re hard at work on content focusing on the firm&#x27;s latest AI-based frame generation technology - DLSS 3.
First impressions on the RTX 4090 itself though? It&#x27;s easily one of the biggest gen-on-gen increases in performance we&#x27;ve seen, even based on limited testing. 4K gaming for higher refresh rate monitors and TVs is not a problem on most modern titles - and by extension, 8K at 60fps is now viable if you&#x27;re one of the crazy few (like me) that actually has an 8K TV. Combine that increase in performance with the new DLSS 3 - with its AI-based frame generation - and suddenly the most intense workloads in PC gaming play out with unerring fluidity.
We were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already sunk a full weekend into it, we&#x27;re not done yet and need some extra time - so with that being the case, we&#x27;ve put together a teaser video showing some of the work we&#x27;ve already done.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s new season is now underway, after kicking off on Sunday with a fresh cinematic that finally unmasks Brie Larson as a key character. 


For several months now, Larson has been voicing the role of Paradigm, one of the game&#x27;s heroic Seven. The Captain Marvel actress debuted as Paradigm in Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 3 Season 2 live event, where she commanded players as they took control of the game&#x27;s infamous bear mech. 


Larson has regularly popped up since, voicing audio logs and mission chatter for Fortnite&#x27;s weekly tasks through the recently-concluded Chapter 3 Season 3. Now, with the launch of Season 4, we&#x27;ve seen her with her helmet off for the first time.

Nintendo Minute was a weekly series which ended in December 2021. The show was hosted by former PR managers for Nintendo of America Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang. Since Nintendo Minute ended, the pair both left Nintendo and went on to create their own podcast.

In episode 31 of Kit and Krysta Podcast, when responding to questions submitted through Patreon, Ellis and Yang recalled a time when they had brought up the idea of a Nuzlocke run to The Pokémon Company.

This trailer sees everyone&#x27;s favourite blue blur being incredibly blue and blurry as he makes his way through the world. Oh, and Shadow and Doctor Eggman are also hot on his heels. 


Along with this teaser, which you can see below, Sega has assured us that Sonic will &quot;shatter&quot; our worlds when Sonic Prime airs this winter on Netflix. And yes, I feel quite agitated writing about a Netflix show with the word &#x27;Prime&#x27; in its title.

                              <span>Nvidia has announced its latest generation of GeForce RTX graphics cards at its GTC AI conference. The Nvidia RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are the first GPUs from the &#x27;Ada Lovelace&#x27; series, and they should be up to twice as fast as their last-gen counterparts in rasterised games - and up to four times as fast in ray-traced games.  
The RTX 4090 24GB will be available on October 12th and costs $1599/£1679, while the RTX 4080 16GB arrives in November and costs $1199/£1269. There&#x27;s also an RTX 4080 12GB model that costs $899/£949. The 4090 and 4080 are reportedly two to four times faster than their Ampere equivalents, which are the 3090 Ti and the 3080 Ti, respectively. 
Note that Nvidia RTX 30-series cards will remain on sale for the moment, filling in the bottom part of the market until lower-tier RTX 40-series GPUs arrive.

                              <span>EA has confirmed it is developing a single-player third-person action adventure Iron Man game as part of a new collaboration between it and Marvel for &quot;several&quot; new projects.


The game - which is yet to be titled - is in the works at Star Wars Squadrons studio Motive, which is also developing the upcoming Dead Space remake.


The project still seems some way off, and EA lists it as in pre-production. As with other recent early announcements, the confirmation appears to have been made to spur recuitment on the game (and also follows earlier whispers of its existence).

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man made its way to PC earlier in the year, and along with it a multitude of mods have swung onto the scene. 


Now, one such mod has given the game a literal face lift, by replacing the new model of Peter Parker with that of the game&#x27;s original PlayStation 4 one. 


This mod was uploaded to Nexus mods by DaigronCDM. Known as the &#x27;John Bubniak - PS4 face restoration mod&#x27;, it does exactly as you&#x27;d expect. It makes Peter Parker look more like John Bubniak, Spidey&#x27;s original face model before the character was redesigned to look more like actor Yuri Lowenthal.

                              <span>Microsoft has ditched its online checks for Xbox One discs when playing on an Xbox Series X.
The online requirements for Xbox games have previously come under fire for being unclear and rendering downloaded and offline games unplayable during service outages. 

Microsoft has recently made a quiet change to the checks made when launching games on Xbox Series X. For anyone making good use of the Series X&#x27;s backwards compatibility, there are now no online DRM checks for Xbox One discs. (Of course, this was not an issue on the disc-less Series S.)

This mechanic, spotted by VGC, now offers players the opportunity to switch game regions from 50Hz PAL (a notably slower standard) to NTSC 60Hz through Syphon Filter 2&#x27;s settings menu.


You can see how this process looks in the image below.

Of course, this batch is undoubtedly headlined by the long-awaited arrival of Deathloop, the full version of Grounded, and indie hit Valheim on PC.


Parents and the young at heart may also be pleased to see new release Paw Patrol Grand Prix is also part of this latest update. The popular pups&#x27; take on Mario Kart joins Game Pass next week.

Valve has announced it has &quot;beaten [its] own estimates yet again&quot; thanks to &quot;increased production&quot;. 


As a result, it has now sent out all its emails to those in the Q3 bracket of reservations, and is now getting a headstart on those in Q4.

Butterfly Soup 2 is due to launch on 29th October, and will follow the four main characters a few months after the original story.

We&#x27;ve previously featured Butterfly Soup in a piece by Natalie Flores on the humanisation of queer women through humour in games, and Butterfly Soup has this in spades.

Talking to IGN, Director Kento Kinoshita stated Capcom is &quot;creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga.&quot;


This means any future entries to the series will likely introduce us to a new set of characters or bring back some older faces from the previous generations of games - though Capcom itself is tight-lipped on any further details.

Wilson issued the comment at a financial event organised by Goldman Sachs (transcribed by Seeking Alpha), where he contrasted Call of Duty&#x27;s situation with that of Battlefield - the latter of which, he boasted, was &quot;platform agnostic&quot;.


&quot;In a world where there may be questions over the future of Call of Duty and what platforms that might be on or might not be on, being platform agnostic and completely cross-platform with Battlefield, I think is a tremendous opportunity,&quot; Wilson said.

Social media logins to a Nintendo Account and the Image Share service are the next features that Nintendo is dropping support for.

                              <span>More leaked footage from Diablo 4 has found its way onto the internet, adding to the blizzard being faced by Blizzard.


As with previous leaks from August, this footage appears to have originated from the ongoing Friend and Family beta version of the game - something that is labelled as a &quot;private test build&quot;. 


The latest leaks were uploaded to reddit and show a total of 43 minutes of gameplay footage. This  work-in-progress  footage includes the map, various cosmetic options and a variety of attacks - though is all subject to change before the release of the full game.

                              <span>A PlayStation 5 with a detachable disc drive is reportedly in the works by Sony for launch around September next year.


The report, by Insider Gaming, suggests the console will otherwise have near-identical hardware to current PS5 models, with the only difference being the removable drive itself, and an extra USB-C port for it to plug in.


There&#x27;s also the suggestion this new console will be sold both on its own and with the detachable disc drive included.

Allen recently gathered some online clout around the fact he had posted, under the alias The Real Insider, details of the various Assassin&#x27;s Creed games Ubisoft was set to announce during its event last week. 


How did Allen know these details? He had been pre-briefed by Ubisoft itself on the contents of its presentation under embargo - which he then promptly ignored and wrote anonymously about on the internet.

                              <span>Rockstar has acknowledged the enormous Grand Theft Auto 6 leak of work-in-progress development materials that took place over the weekend.
In a statement published this afternoon on Twitter, as the company returned to work, Rockstar admitted it had suffered a &quot;network intrusion&quot; - a hack - from which the early development footage of GTA 6 had been taken.
