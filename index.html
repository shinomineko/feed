PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton has acquired the rights to bring the RPG to mobile devices, lauding the game&#x27;s &quot;potential and distinct creativity&quot; and stating developer Ironmace had &quot;tapped into something compelling&quot;.
&quot;We&#x27;ve been watching Dark and Darker&#x27;s potential and distinct creativity with great interest,&quot; said Rafael Lim, Krafton&#x27;s senior head of publishing.

                              <span>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners eagerly awaiting the previously announced August release of ghost hunting hit Phasmophobia will now have a bit longer to wait; developer Kinetic Games has opted to push launch back to October after a &quot;recent fire incident&quot;.


Phasmophobia first made waves when it launched into early access on PC back in September 2020, quickly amassing an enthusiastic following after streamers helped propel its spooky investigatory ghost hunting action - which sees players attempting to gather evidence and complete objectives across a variety of haunted locales - up the charts as Halloween struck.


Since then, Kinetic Games has continued to expand and evolve the core co-operative ghost hunting experience with new maps, new equipment, new ghost types, better haunting AI, and, more recently, custom difficulty settings. And with the PC version developing nicely, a console release was confirmed earlier this year, with the studio announcing Phasmophobia would hit PlayStation 5 (including PSVR2) and Xbox Series X/S this August.

                              <span>What&#x27;s happening with Hyenas? Announced a year ago but still without a release date, Creative Assembly&#x27;s team-based sci-fi extraction shooter was playable publicly this week for the first time at Gamescom in Cologne, following a somewhat eye-opening summation of its status last week from Sega top brass.


I played a brief match of Hyenas on the Gamescom showfloor and found it a bright and breezy shooter with fun PVPVE moments and some promising zero-G sections. But my time with it was too brief to really leave with much of a lasting impression. 


It&#x27;s good news, then, that Hyenas will soon be available to play more widely, via a Steam beta test you can sign up for now, with access going live on 31st August. It&#x27;s from that, I think, that people will finally be able to decide for themselves what is working and what is not - and this is Creative Assembly told me it is waiting for as well.

                              <span>A little over three years after acclaimed construction and automation sim Factorio left its lengthy early access with a 1.0 release, developer Wube Software has shared details of its first expansion, Space Age, which will be picking up right where the base game stops.


Factorio, for the uninitiated, casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation. The ultimate goal is to build a rocket ship enabling you to escape the planet you&#x27;ve crash-landed on, which is the point where Space Age kicks in.


In a post revealing first concrete details of Factorio&#x27;s expansion, Wube explained Space Age continues the journey after those rockets have launched, taking players out among the stars where they can &quot;discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage [their] fleet of interplanetary space platforms.&quot;

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s two single-player modes have been detailed and were playable at this year&#x27;s Gamescom event.


The first is Invasion mode, which turns the fighting game into a Mario Party-esque boardgame. Players will choose a character and explore an area through branching paths, with each node offering a new challenge to overcome before progressing.


These comprise a mixture of individual battles, minigames and treasures, with extra modifiers offering a twist on typical gameplay. Perhaps fire-shooting demons or a fiery vortex will interrupt battle, plus plenty more.

                              <span>China imposed a “pilot program banning fishing in parts of the south-west Atlantic Ocean from July to October, and parts of the eastern Pacific Ocean from September to December.” However, the conservation group Oceana analyzed the data and figured out that the Chinese weren’t fishing in those areas in those months, anyway.

blockquote&gt;In the south-west Atlantic moratorium area, Oceana found there had been no fishing conducted by Chinese fleets in the same time period in 2019. Between 1,800 and 8,500 fishing hours were detected in the zone in each of the five years to 2019. In the eastern Pacific zone, China’s fishing fleet appeared to fish only 38 hours in the year before the ban’s introduction...</span>

                              <span>A man who gained notoriety for leaking 45 minutes of Starfield has been arrested for handling stolen goods - reportedly including copies of the game he attempted to sell online.

As spotted by the ever keen eyes of the Starfield community over on Reddit and shared by US arrests site RecentlyBooked.com, 29-year-old Darin Harris was processed by the Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff&#x27;s Office yesterday, 24th August.

Harris was charged with theft of property valued between $2,500-$10,000 USD, theft of property valued at $1,000 or less, and for possession of marijuana. As noted by Kotaku, Harris had been spotted uploading listings for numerous copies of Starfield - including its premium Constellation Edition - on the Japanese e-commerce platform Mercari prior to his arrest.

                              <span>Following Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS 3.5 announcements at Gamescom, AMD has finally revealed FSR 3 - along with a separate frame generation solution that works on all DX11 and DX12 titles. In a meeting with AMD, Digital Foundry saw both technologies in action and came away impressed.
FSR 3 is a frame generation solution that operates along similar lines to Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS 3 - combining frame generation (Fluid Motion Frames) with super resolution upscaling (FSR 2) and latency reduction (Anti-Lag+) in a small number of supported games, with Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum set to first debut the technology. FSR 3 will work on Radeon graphics cards, as well as Nvidia and Intel GPUs. 
So, how does FSR 3 look? At Gamescom, we had a demonstration of both titles running with the new technology active on a Radeon 7900 XTX running at 4K output. Both were running with v-sync on, which AMD recommends for frame-pacing purposes. In the very small Forspoken demo we saw, the game was running locked at 120 frames per second and looked just as a v-synced 120fps should look. The game was running in FSR 2 quality mode providing its own frame-rate boost, with frame-gen then taking you up to the limit. In terms of fluidity and clarity, FSR 3 looked a match for DLSS 3 - a view shared by Alex, Rich and John, who were all present to see the demos in person. A great start for FSR 3.

                              <span>AMD has officially unveiled its RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT graphics cards, finally completing its RDNA 3 lineup after announcing its first GPUs in November last year. Both cards are intended to target 1440p displays and run games at max settings, including ray tracing, above 60fps. They&#x27;ll also support AMD&#x27;s exciting new frame generation technologies, which we&#x27;ve written up as a separate article after going hands-on with FSR 3 and Fluid Motion Frames at Gamescom. 
Both graphics cards use the new Navi 32 GPU. The 7800 XT gets the fully-enabled 60CU version with a 256-bit memory bus, 64MB of Infinity Cache and 16GB of GDDR6 memory running at 19.5Gbps, while the 7700 XT is cut-down - but not by much at all. It uses a 54CU design with a 192-bit bus and 48MB of Infinity Cache, backed with 12GB of GDDR6 running at 18Gbps. TDP figures are also very similar, at 245W vs 263W, with the 7700 XT clocked higher to make up for its lower CU complement. 
AMD&#x27;s performance data looks impressive here, with the RX 7800 XT trading blows with the RTX 4070 and the RX 7700 XT more convincingly dealing with the RTX 4060 Ti. Both cards are also shown exceeding 60fps at max settings in a host of recent AAA releases, including The Last of Us Part 1, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Hogwarts Legacy and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

                              <span>Pokémon Sleep, the new nap-tracking app that hopes to help us all catch some Zzzzs as well as some Pokémon, has hit 10m downloads. That&#x27;s across iOS and Android.


To commemorate this milestone, the Pokémon team is rewarding all users with a special gift. 


If you are one of those partaking 10 million slumberers, head over to the app now and make sure you have it updated to version 1.0.6. Then, you should be able to find this gift of 1000 Sleep Points, one Good Camp Ticket, three Ingredient Tickets and five Poké Biscuits. Lovely.

                              <span>Larian has released its first &quot;major&quot; update for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and when the studio said major it wasn&#x27;t kidding. 


This update will address a myriad of issues in the game, with the developer stating it will target a rather substantial 1000 bugs, as well as &quot;balancing, flow issues and much, much more&quot;. 


As Larian joked, it is so immense, the patch notes couldn&#x27;t be detailed in their entirety on Steam, as they exceeded the platform&#x27;s text limit.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard is currently taking part in the great big Starfield marketing push of 2023. But, it isn&#x27;t just the studio&#x27;s upcoming space game that we have all been waiting for. Another of Howard and Bethesda&#x27;s flagship series is Elder Scrolls, and ever since it was announced that The Elder Scrolls 6 was indeed in the pipeline, many have been eager to hear more about what&#x27;s next. 


The thing is, this next chapter was announced years ago. A little over five years ago, in fact. And since then, we have heard very little about it at all. Back in 2021 Bethesda said it was in a design phase, but from the outside looking in, it is still largely just a name on gaming&#x27;s often vast horizon. 


Now admittedly, at the time of its reveal, Bethesda was keen to make sure everyone knew Elder Scrolls 6 was still a way out, and said it was in pre-production. But, even so, that was back in 2018. So, does the studio regret announcing this next chapter well before its actual release date, which still remains an unknown (although we do know it will be before Fallout 5)?

Sega&#x27;s Switch version takes the exuberant rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - where the goal is essentially to orientate your maraca-ing arms to match the position shown on screen then shake in time with the prompts - but slings in new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


Additionally, Love Checker mode is back for those eager to gauge their compatibility with a partner based on the accuracy of their maraca-ing prowess, and there&#x27;s an online multiplayer mode, where the aim is to keep the beat and avoid being eliminated.

                              <span>We&#x27;re big fans of developer Jump Over The Age&#x27;s highly acclaimed tabletop-inspired narrative RPG Citizen Sleeper here at Eurogamer, so July&#x27;s sequel reveal was a happy day indeed; and while there&#x27;s still some way to go until it&#x27;s release, creator Gareth Damian Martin has now shared a few new details, including confirmation it&#x27;ll be heading to Game Pass.


Speaking in a video shared by Xbox as part of its Gamescom activities (hence the Game Pass focus), Martin explained Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will once again combine &quot;free-form table-top RPG inspired dice-based gameplay with slice-of-life stories and relatable characters&quot; - only, this time, it&#x27;ll be &quot;bigger, more varied, more challenging&quot;.


Citizen Sleeper 2 brings a new, malfunctioning Sleeper android protagonist and a new setting in the Starward Belt, on the edge of the Helion System. One of its biggest changes, though, is that players get their own ramshackle ship and can assemble its crew, which Martin says is an attempt to &quot;capture what&#x27;s special about stories like Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, where it&#x27;s not about hauling tonnes of titanium across the galaxy but...getting into trouble with a complex cast of characters, improvising, making do, and always running on the edge of disaster.&quot;

                              <span>As Fortnite&#x27;s stellar current season draws to a close (seriously, the jungle is fab), Epic is cranking the hype handle in anticipation of tomorrow&#x27;s Chapter 4 Season 4, now officially titled The Final Resort, with a first trailer revealing some of what&#x27;s to come.


Epic has been teasing a heist theme on social media for a couple of days now, but today&#x27;s trailer makes things official in a big way, showing a new cast of characters - almost certainly this season&#x27;s Battle Pass gang - infiltrating a luxury mansion to retrieve a golden skull belonging to Fortnite character Oro (who has some nebulous connection to earlier antagonist Midas, but without Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips&#x27; encyclopaedic Fortnite lore knowledge, I have no idea what the implications of this might be).


As the trailer&#x27;s heist plays out, we see lightning grenades, laser traps, a portable gun turret sneakily concealed in a briefcase (I&#x27;d imagine we can safely say all of that will be making an appearnce to spice up this season&#x27;s gameplay), and, yes, an alarming muscular Fishsticks, proving there&#x27;s plenty more where that cat with a six-pack and swole unicorn came from.

                              <span>This article talks about new Mexican laws about food labeling, and the lengths to which food manufacturers are going to ensure that they are not effective. There are the typical high-pressure lobbying tactics and lawsuits. But there’s also examples of companies hacking the laws:
Companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz have begun designing their products so that their packages don’t have a true front or back, but rather two nearly identical labels—except for the fact that only one side has the required warning.

This post explains how to use the new sidecar feature, which enables restartable init containers and is available in alpha in Kubernetes 1.28. We want your feedback so that we can graduate this feature as soon as possible.
The concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. In 2015, sidecars were described in a blog post about composite containers as additional containers that “extend and enhance the ‘main’ container”. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without n…</span>

The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support
for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis.
Now, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many
new improvements.
Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems.
This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization
when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial
design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory
was detected on a node.
In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This represented
a sign…</span>

                              <span>Larian&#x27;s Swen Vincke says Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 will be coming to Xbox this year, having sat down with Phil Spencer at Gamescom to hash out a few details. 


The recent RPG has seen a roaring success on PC, where it launched earlier this month. It is set to come to PlayStation 5 on 6th September. 


However, Xbox has been notably absent from the release schedule thus far, with split-screen gameplay on Series S being the main sticking point.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; swashbuckling Monkey Island collaboration continues in the second of three monthly Tall Tales next Thursday, 31st August, Rare has announced.


Pirates got their first taste of Rare&#x27;s take on Mêlée Island - conjured into existence from the memories of Guybrush Threepwood, thanks to some magical shenanigans relating to Sea of Thieves&#x27; purgatorial Sea of the Damned - back in July, in an adventure that admirably captured the series&#x27; point-and-click ambience in exploratory first-person 3D.


As you might recall, that first episode - titled The Journey to Mêlée Island - concluded with the return of a certain big bad, and while there are still plenty of unknowns around episode two, The Quest for Guybrush, Rare has already teased that the impassable fog previously preventing exploration beyond Mêlée island&#x27;s port town will lift, giving players access to the whole of the island and some iconic locations from the series&#x27; history.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 is set to release next month. Following the base game&#x27;s launch, DLC characters (kharacters?) will join the game. 


Two such characters will be The Boys&#x27; Homelander and Omni-Man from Invincible. While both of these superhero-types are popular in their own right, they are also remarkably similar in many ways. This is something that had caused the Mortal Kombat 1 community a touch of concern. 


However, concerned we should not be, at least according to Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon. Speaking with IGN, the developer said these two cape-wearing, super-strong chaps will not be clones of each other when they swoop into the game.

Speaking to The Wrap, Mazin stated the team hadn&#x27;t spoken about spin-offs themselves, as everyone&#x27;s keeping their focus on the games&#x27; main narratives of Joel and Ellie. 


However, while the showrunner may not be dipping his toe into the spin-off waters any time soon, he is &quot;not against the idea of other shows that may draw from these characters or that world&quot;.

This feature will be coming to LG&#x27;s 2021-2023 Smart TV models for those of us here in the UK.


Those with 2023&#x27;s LG Smart TVs will be able to access their Luna games directly from the Home Screen Game Card. Meanwhile, those with Smart TVs from 2021/22 will be able to download the Luna app (which can be found on the LG content store).

Yes, you can begin playing Starfield again via a New Game Plus mode, which Bethesda has now confirmed is present in Starfield.


Exactly what Starfield&#x27;s New Game Plus mode will allow is something we&#x27;ll need to play (and complete) the game to find out - whether it lets you carry over items as well as character upgrades when you replay the game&#x27;s story, for example.

                              <span>Is the relentless predictabilty of freighter life getting you down in No Man&#x27;s Sky? Well gloom no more because things are about to get a whole lot rowdier thanks to the exploratory space sim&#x27;s latest free update, Echoes, which introduces epic freighter-to-freighter battles and Star Wars-style trench runs, alongside a new robot race and more today, 24th August.


Starting with those freighter battles, Echoes - which got the tiniest of teases to celebrate No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s seventh birthday at the end of last week - expands on the game&#x27;s previous system, which made it possible for small ships (whether they be piloted by players or NPC pirates) to attack friendly freighters and fleets. Come Echoes&#x27; arrival, however, players can encounter situations where merchant fleets are instead under attack from aggressive pirates freighters officially known as Dreadnoughts - which they&#x27;ll have the option to defend against and defeat. 


In time-honoured video game fashion, that involves attacking their weak spots, which is where the Star-Wars-style trench runs come in, requiring pilots to zip along narrow corridors in their opponents&#x27; hull to shoot their red blinky things (a combat HUD overhaul now handily displays the hull integrity of large vessels) until they&#x27;re completely atomised.

It is set to arrive later this year, on 4th October. So, not too much longer to wait. 


Along with this news, developer Fatshark treated us all to a brand new teaser for its upcoming Xbox release. You can see it for yourself in the video below.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t expect to see Call of Duty popping up on Game Pass as soon as the ink dries on Microsoft&#x27;s proposed Activision Blizzard deal (if it dries, that is - of course nothing has been confirmed as yet). 


Speaking with IGN at Gamescom, Xbox head Phil Spencer stated there is a lot more to getting a game on its subscription service than many may realise. 


&quot;I want to make sure people know that there&#x27;s work to actually move games to Game Pass,&quot; the exec stated when asked about Activision&#x27;s shooter coming to the service. &quot;So, for people who think like, &#x27;the deal is going to close, and then everything&#x27;s available on Game Pass&#x27; - that&#x27;s not true.&quot;

In a new factsheet for the game, Ukrainian studio GSC Game World stated its first-person shooter survival horror game will launch next year, but did not share a specific date outside of &quot;Q1&quot;. 

Rumblings earlier in the year had the upcoming sequel pegged with a December release date.

                              <span>Xbox has said the launch of Starfield will be the &quot;starting gun&quot; for even more first-party releases on Xbox. 


Speaking to Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz at Gamescom, Xbox chief marketing officer Jerret West said he believes Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space opera is the &quot;doorway&quot; to more regular Xbox exclusives.


&quot;I was sitting there watching the same [Starfield presentation] you were this morning and I was like... this is really the start of something that&#x27;s going to then lead to Forza, then in 2024 as we go to Hellblade, and we think about Towerborne which is on the show floor, we think about Avowed, and we&#x27;ve got stories we haven&#x27;t told yet as well, that are going to unfurl in 2024 and 2025,&quot; West shared, calling this lineup a &quot;multi-year relay race of first-party titles&quot; with Starfield the &quot;starting gun&quot;.

Epic&#x27;s newly announced First Run program is an opt in scheme. If a developer chooses to participate in the initiative, they will receive 100 percent revenue for six months.


Once this period of exclusivity ends, the split will revert back to the store&#x27;s original set up of 88 percent going to developers, and 12 percent going to Epic.

                              <span>Starfield might be hogging the spotlight right now, but that doesn&#x27;t mean Bethesda has forgotten about its other babies; Fallout - or more specifically its upcoming live-action TV adaptation - is, for instance, having a bit of a moment right now following a brief Gamescom showing and confirmation from Amazon that it&#x27;s launching in 2024.


Amazon first announced it was adopting Fallout for its Prime Video streaming service back in the summer of 2020, and since then, we&#x27;ve had ample casting news, on-set photos (official and otherwise), but nothing in the way of a trailer.


That&#x27;s now (sort of) changed courtesy of a Starfield presentation held at Gamescom today. Amid the space RPG&#x27;s strictly hands-off showing, designer Todd Howard slipped in what he called a &quot;sneak peek&quot; at Amazon&#x27;s upcoming Fallout show.

                              <span>SteamWorld Build, the &quot;Anno meets Dungeon Keeper&quot; city builder from Thunderful Games and internal studio The Station, finally has a release date and will be forging new frontiers on PC, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Game Pass from 1st December.


SteamWorld Build is, of course, the latest in the genre-hopping SteamWorld series, which has so far explored the likes of platform mining in SteamWorld Dig and its sequel, tower defense in the appropriately titled SteamWorld Tower Defense, turn-based strategy in SteamWorld Heist, and card-battling RPGing in SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech.


It&#x27;s all change again for SteamWorld Build, which this time challenges players to construct a city - or, more specifically, a sort of sci-fi-infused Wild West mining town - in a bid to attract enough Steambot workers to dig deep into the nearby abandoned mines which, or so it&#x27;s rumoured, contain ancient technology that&#x27;ll help everyone get off the dying world.

                              <span>BioWare has announced it&#x27;ll be laying off approximately 50 employees - approximately 20 percent of its total workforce according to recent employment figures - as part of a &quot;shift towards a more agile and more focused studio&quot;.


&quot;In order to meet the needs of our upcoming projects, continue to hold ourselves to the highest standard of quality, and ensure BioWare can continue to thrive in an industry that&#x27;s rapidly evolving,&quot; BioWare general manager Gary McKay wrote in a post shared on the developer&#x27;s website, &quot;we must shift towards a more agile and more focused studio. It will allow our developers to iterate quickly, unlock more creativity, and form a clear vision of what we&#x27;re building before development ramps up.&quot;


&quot;To achieve this,&quot; McKay continued, &quot;we find ourselves in a position where change is not only necessary, but unavoidable. As difficult as this is to say, rethinking our approach to development inevitably means reorganising our team to match the studio&#x27;s changing needs.&quot;

                              <span>Six years after it gave Turok 2 the remaster treatment and eight since it did the same to part one, retro specialist Nightdive Studios is back to finish what it started, and is concluding the trilogy with a Turok 3 remaster for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 14th November.


Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion, as it&#x27;s more formally known, initially launched for N64 and Game Boy Color (albeit in a considerably different form) back in 2000, around about the same time Jarvis Cocker was meeting up by the fountain down the road. For the trilogy&#x27;s final outing, players could choose between two protagonists - Joseph and Danielle Fireseed, siblings of Turok 2 protagonist Joshua Fireseed - as they worked to defeat the Oblivion and its Flesh Eater followers in another bout of dinosaur-flavoured first-person shooter action.


Turok 3&#x27;s remaster - which uses the N64 version as its base - marks the first time the game has been available since its original release, and Nightdive is promising a range of improvements, including enhanced environment art, character models, and updated weapon models, alongside &quot;advanced rendering features&quot; that&#x27;ll include the likes of anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 27 years since Revolution Software&#x27;s Broken Sword series introduced the world to protagonists George Stobbart and Nicole Collard, but the adventurous twosome still aren&#x27;t ready for retirement just yet; they&#x27;re returning for a new adventure, Broken Sword - Parzival&#x27;s Stone, and a remake of their first outing, Shadow of the Templars, coming early next year.


Parzival&#x27;s Stone will be the sixth entry in the Broken Sword series - following on from Shadow of the Templars, The Smoking Mirror, The Sleeping Dragon, The Angel of Death, and 2013&#x27;s The Serpent&#x27;s Cruse - and will once again be helmed by series originator Charles Cecil.


It sees George and Nico getting caught up in terrifying conspiracy featuring Nazi treasure hunters, brutal mediaeval histories, and Quantum Physics, where ruthless technology entrepreneurs, corrupt government agencies, and billion-dollar global energy corporations are all battling for possession of a manuscript pointing to the secret location of the mythical thousand-year-old Grail, just perhaps not the one we&#x27;re used to hearing about.

                              <span>Twitch has launched its Discovery Feed experiment to a select number of users.


Earlier this year, Twitch announced its plans to introduce a new Stories and Discovery feature to the platform, with the idea that this would provide streamers with a further way to reach their followers when not live streaming.


As Ed reported at the time, the stories in this case would last for 24 hours and appear on the Twitch mobile app. It is a similar approach that other social media platforms have adopted.

                              <span>Phil Spencer has said that Xbox must have a mobile presence in order for the brand to continue to thrive.


In an interview with Eurogamer today at Gamescom in Cologne, Spencer emphasised the importance of mobile for Xbox to continue to grow its audience - and said it was the core reason behind Microsoft&#x27;s interest in buying Activision Blizzard (including its mobile arm King) for $68.7bn.


&quot;The reason we&#x27;re in the acquisition discussion with Activision Blizzard King is around their mobile capability,&quot; Spencer told me. &quot;Because it&#x27;s just something we don&#x27;t have.

It&#x27;s called the PlayStation Portal remote player, and promises to bring that PS5 experience to the palm of our hands. As Sony previously said, it will come with the features of a DualSense wireless controller, such as adaptive triggers and haptic feedback.


Meanwhile, the remote player&#x27;s screen will be &quot;capable&quot; of 1080p resolution at 60fps.

This upcoming release has been created in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, and is in development for PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. 

You can see a little preview of how it is all shaping up in the trailer below.

This accessibility feature is exactly as it sounds - it will allow players to hear what is happening on screen thanks to audio description. This will, of course, be a game changer for blind or partially sighted players.


GamesHub managing editor Edmond Tran shared a video showing this feature in action over on X (formerly Twitter).

Eurogamer was able to see an early screening, so can share what was seen.


Phil Spencer told the audience Todd Howard had described the game to him as &quot;irresponsibly large&quot;, but here&#x27;s how the journey begins. Spoilers ahead.

                              <span>After much anticipation, Starfield&#x27;s release is a mere matter of weeks away. And, in a bid to keep the hype train running, Bethesda has shared an all new live-action trailer for its upcoming space extravaganza. 


Revealed as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, the trailer kicks off with an orchestral version of Elton John&#x27;s Rocket Man. It then shows a young girl, eyes bright and full of wonder, making her way to the launch pad of an equally bright eyed astronaut. He gives her a Constellation badge, and then blasts off into the atmosphere to deal with space battles, planet exploration and, perhaps, a touch of radioactivity. 


It is all rather atmospheric, although I am still hopeful that we will see some more gameplay before the game&#x27;s final release. You can have a watch of Starfield&#x27;s live-action trailer in the video below.

                              <span>Several years after it first launched, Cyberpunk 2077 is getting an update so impressive, it feels like we are about to see the game&#x27;s true potential, as it was promised many moons ago, finally realised. 


As part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, developer CD Projekt Red unveiled a brand new teaser for its upcoming DLC - Phantom Liberty - which releases next month. Known as the &#x27;New Ways to Play&#x27; trailer, it gave us a taste of what&#x27;s in store for Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s future. 


The trailer gave us a closer look at some new weapons that will be introduced in the Phantom Liberty expansion, such as the Rasetsu sniper rifle and the Grit handgun. It also showed off redesigned cyberware, perks, the Relic skill tree, new vehicles (including vehicle combat, which will see players able to shoot out of the car while driving and the ability to &quot;quickhack&quot; enemies on the road), and a new police system.

                              <span>Gamescom 2023 has kicked off - as you might have noticed - and Nvidia has unveiled DLSS 3.5, a new version of DLSS that adds &#x27;ray reconstruction&#x27; -  essentially AI-tuned denoising that boosts the quality of ray tracing effects on RTX graphics cards. The firm also announced a new community remaster of the legendary Half-Life 2, new DLSS 3 and Reflex titles and more. 
Let&#x27;s cover the DLSS 3.5 news first, as this is fascinating. The critical information here is that real-time ray tracing relies on a relatively small number of rays that are cast - certainly far fewer than one ray per pixel - so we don&#x27;t have a complete picture of the &#x27;ground truth&#x27;, we have an image with both signal and noise. That means a denoising step is required to fill in the missing pixels, which uses techniques like temporal acculuation and spatial interpolation to generate a higher-quality final image. 
So far, so standard. Normally these denoisers are hand-tuned, but the innovation is that Nvidia has trained an AI network (on five times as much data as they used to train DLSS 3) that can achieve better results. It can use different methods with different ray-traced effects, recognise good pixels and discard bad pixels, and retain the high frequency detail that would normally be smoothed away by upscaling.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures anthology studio Supermassive Games is developing Little Nightmare 3 for release in 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch. It&#x27;ll be playable solo, with an AI-controlled second character, or with a friend in online co-op.


This announcement marks a change of studio for the Little Nightmare franchise, after the first two games in the series were created by Swedish developer Tarsier Studios. But this isn&#x27;t unexpected - Tarsier were bought by European megapublisher Embracer back in 2021, which stated at the time that Tarsier would now work on something else.


The rights to Little Nightmares remained with publisher Bandai Namco, meanwhile, which already tapped the UK-based Supermassive to work on the Enhanced Edition of Little Nightmares 2 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

                              <span>Bungie has given Destiny 2&#x27;s next expansion, The Final Shape, a thorough unveiling, confirming it&#x27;ll whisk players to the &quot;infinite, vast, unknowable&quot; Pale Heart within the Traveler when it launches for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 27th February next year.


As per Bungie&#x27;s info-heavy reveal livestream, The Final Shape - described as &quot;the last expedition of Destiny&#x27;s first saga&quot; - will see players entering the Traveler via the portal opened at the end of this year&#x27;s Lightfall expansion for a showdown with current big bad, the Witness. It&#x27;s an adventure Bungie says will &quot;answer questions on a grander scale&quot; while also giving players the opportunity to connect with familiar companions on a more personal level.


That, of course, includes the formerly deceased fan-favourite Cayde-6, played by Nathan Fillion, who appears to be making a return as a Virgil-style guide manifested by the Pale Heart itself. Seemingly, this world inside the Traveler has reality shaping power that the Witness is attempting to use to refashion the universe in a vision of frozen perfection - the Final Shape of the title - but, as the Guardians enter the Pale Heart, it shifts to reflect their experiences too.

                              <span>If it&#x27;s more Mortal Kombat 1 you want, then it&#x27;s more Mortal Kombat 1 you&#x27;ll get! And, thanks to developer NetherRealm&#x27;s later trailer - confirming the return of Sindel, General Shao, Motaro, and Shujinko - you&#x27;ll never look at a ponytail in the same way again.


These four latest additions to Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s line-up get their introductions in a trailer blending story cinematics and fighting action that, narratively, appears to happen relatively early on in proceedings as Raiden is welcomed into the fold as Earthrealm&#x27;s champion.


Skepticism almost immediately ensues from General Shao and chums, but doubts are soon laid as we switch to a fresh chunk of typically brutal, bone-shattering in-game fighting action that sees Raiden paired with Shujinko and Sindel with Motaro.

                              <span>A brand-new and rather unsettling trailer for Alan Wake 2 rounded off Gamescom Opening Night Live this evening. 


Remedy&#x27;s creative director Sam Lake introduced the trailer for the upcoming sequel, addressing Alan&#x27;s struggle (putting it mildly) to escape the &quot;nightmare dimension&quot; of the Dark Place. This is somewhere the poor novelist has been trapped for the last 13 years, because yes it really has been that long since the first Alan Wake was originally released. 


The new trailer was a combination of in-game live-action footage, in-game cinematics and gameplay, with Lake stating this was to show &quot;the dream-like nature of the Dark Place&quot;.

The game is an ode to the hometown in Northern England of its creators Will Todd and James Carbutt who comprise developer Coal Supper. It follows their first game The Good Time Garden, inspired by 90s kids TV and The Beano comic.


&quot;With our first game, we basically followed our noses as far as a shoestring budget and our spare time would allow - so it&#x27;s been an amazing opportunity to run down that rabbit hole with Panic behind us, and we&#x27;re excited to show the world what we&#x27;ve found at the bottom,&quot; said Coal Supper.

Sonic Superstars - the vibrantly hued return to Sonic&#x27;s side-scrolling platform roots, albeit now with a four-player co-operative twist - arrives on 17th of October for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4, PC, and Switch.


Before that, Sonic Frontiers - last year&#x27;s entertaining, if flawed, &quot;open zone&quot; spin on the hedgehog&#x27;s 3D platforming adventures - will get the third and final of three previously announced free content updates on 28th September.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re old enough to remember the days when consoles were made of wood and powered by the hopes and dreams of a better future, you might be excited to know Atari is bringing its classic 70s/80s console, the Atari 2600, back as a &quot;modern day faithful recreation&quot; - and it&#x27;ll even play original cartridges if you still have some lying around behind your Zimmer frame.


The Atari 2600+, as this updated version of the classic console is officially known, has been birthed into the world through the frantic conjoining of Atari and Plaion (formerly Koch Media), and is set to release on 17th November for £99.99/€119.99/$129.99, which is, if nothing else, cheaper than it would have cost you back in 1977.


This new-fangled update features a couple of modern-day revisions including HDMI output, USB power, and multiple screen resolutions, but the selling point here, really, is how close is adheres to the Atari 2600&#x27;s iconic design - wood panel frontage and all.

                              <span>Video game film and TV adaptations seem to be coming at us from all directions these days, however Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert isn&#x27;t keen to see his piratical puzzler head in this direction. 


Speaking at Devcom earlier this week, Gilbert and fellow Monkey Island developers chatted about the most recent release in the series, Return to Monkey Island. 


Along with the discussion about the game&#x27;s conception and art style (something that Gilbert defended on Return&#x27;s announcement last year), the topic turned to film projects based on the series.

                              <span>Another Pokémon that we will be required to catch in our bid to finally have them all has been revealed. 


In a rather haunting trailer, we were introduced to Poltchageist, a transformed tea caddy. Poltchageist is a grass and ghost type Pokémon that holds the spirit, or at least the regret, of a once rather strict and cantankerous tea master.


According to this new trailer, Poltchageist can go around blowing matcha over people, and then inhale (?) that matcha back into its caddy, seeping some of the inflicted person&#x27;s life force as it does so. This is something, as you can see in the trailer below, it does to a room full of innocent children. But, it winks at us at the end, so I am sure they are all ok... right?

Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console, meanwhile, will run at 720p/30fps in handheld mode, although Konami has said it will target 1080p/30fps when docked.

The production company recently partnered with game developer Monomi Park to bring the colourful slime vacuuming series to a new medium. 


As reported by Deadline, the two companies are looking to continue the story of Beatrix LeBeau on the big screen, however no studios appear to be attached to the project at this time.

This collborative update, which is avaiable now, is part of Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s anniversary celebrations, with the dungeon-crawling management sim recently turning one. 


However, don&#x27;t expect to see your flock enjoying a knees up meal with cake and party poppers as part of this crossover. Rather, the team has introduced a new game mode known as Penitence, which will see your Lamb needing to &quot;eat and sleep to survive, along with their followers&quot; for the occasion.

                              <span>Cyberpunk platformer Replaced will now launch in 2024.


The upcoming game, which is described as a 2.5D &quot;retro-futuristic sci-fi&quot; title set in an alternative version of the 1980s, was due to release later this year across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC. 


In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Belarusian-based developer Sad Cat Studio said it &quot;truly [wants] Replaced to be something special and memorable for everybody&quot; and can&#x27;t &quot;afford to release a sub-par game&quot;. Therefore, the team made the decision to delay its launch into next year.

This includes gameplay, cinematics and customisation options.

The move is a major change to Microsoft&#x27;s plans, but one it clearly feels is necessary to get the deal approved by hesitant UK regulators.


If the deal is now approved, streaming rights for all new Activision Blizzard PC and console games released over the next 15 years will be given to Ubisoft - with those rights then existing in perpetuity.

                              <span>Following last month&#x27;s confirmation that a planned sequel to Ubisoft&#x27;s enjoyable open-world romp Immortals: Fenyx Rising had been cancelled, new details of the ill-fated project have emerged, including word it would have combined elements of Elden Ring and Wind Waker to create a follow-up very different from the original.


As reported by Axios, citing two sources familiar with Immortals 2&#x27;s development, work on the project (codenamed Oxygen) began in 2021. It was to be a considerable departure from the 2020 original, ditching that game&#x27;s Greek mythology focus in favour of a setting inspired by Hawaiian Polynesian culture - as we&#x27;ve heard before. Other planned changes, according to Axios, included a more realistic graphical style, the removal of the first game&#x27;s narrator, less emphasis on puzzle solving, and the addition of a story driven by player choice.


Additionally, Immortals 2 was reportedly aiming to significantly shake up Ubisoft&#x27;s familiar open-world formula, trading an overabundance of quest markers and guidance in favour of an Elden-Ring-inspired set-up that would require players to figure out their own path forward - by tracking animals, navigating via the stars, or following the wind - as they sailed between and explored fictional islands inspired by the likes of New Zealand, Tahiti, Easter Island, and Hawaii.

                              <span>Ghostrunner 2, the sequel to developer One More Level&#x27;s acclaimed game of tough-as-nails cyberpunk parkour action and swearing extremely loudly at the screen, finally has a release date and will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 26th October.


Set one year after the events of the first game, Ghostrunner once again whizzes players, in the role of returning protagonist Jack, to a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk future for more &quot;FPP slasher&quot; action (I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not entirely sure what FPP stands for in this instance, but the PP made me laugh), this time battling against a violent AI cult.


Once again, katana violence and acrobatic parkour (I now realise at least one of the Ps might stand for &quot;parkour&quot;) are in order, with One More Level also promising a &quot;deeper exploration of the world beyond Dharma Tower&quot;, nonlinear levels with complex motorbike sections, more interactive bosses, plus &quot;exciting new modes&quot;.

                              <span>As if a couch co-op mode and a Switch release somehow wasn&#x27;t enough new Vampire Survivors stuff to be getting on with, developer Poncle has teased plenty more is still to come, confirming everything seen in a recent &quot;Directer&#x27;s Cut&quot; (yes, with an &quot;e&quot;) leak is real and on the way.


Images and footage of an unreleased Vampire Survivors Directer&#x27;s Cut build shown at a recent event began circulating earlier this month, and Poncle - writing in its update 1.6 release notes - has now acknowledged their existence, explaining, &quot;That&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve been doing in most events (since TGS 2022): hiding some of the future content for the game in plain sight.&quot;


While the developer says the menu screen - and presumably the &quot;Directer&#x27;s Cut&quot; name - featured in the leak might never actually appear in-game, everything else &quot;is scheduled to be fully developed and released in future free updates.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing like a public roadmap for Vampire Survivors&#x27; new content yet, but Poncle confirms &quot;dozens of characters and weapons&quot; are in development for &quot;2023 and beyond&quot; - and to accompany the news, it&#x27;s shared a teaser trailer giving some of that new stuff a first official airing.

                              <span>Microsoft is launching a range of official consoles wraps for Xbox Series X - including a design inspired by Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space RPG and sandwich-collecting sim Starfield - that&#x27;ll go on sale across Europe, Canada, and the US starting in October.


The new wraps consist of solid core panels layered with a fabric finish that are designed to fold around a console and provide a customisation option Microsoft describes as &quot;more affordable and more sustainable than purchasing a special edition or limited edition console&quot;. 


Wraps are secured in place through a combination of hook, loop, and silicon printing on the interior of each panel, and Microsoft says the design ensures vents are kept clear and, thanks to small &quot;feet&quot; at the bottom of each wrap, that air can flow freely through the Xbox Series X.

                              <span>License plate scanners aren’t new. Neither is using them for bulk surveillance. What’s new is that AI is being used on the data, identifying “suspicious” vehicle behavior:
Typically, Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) technology is used to search for plates linked to specific crimes. But in this case it was used to examine the driving patterns of anyone passing one of Westchester County’s 480 cameras over a two-year period. Zayas’ lawyer Ben Gold contested the AI-gathered evidence against his client, decrying it as “dragnet surveillance.”...</span>

                              <span>UPDATE 5.15pm UK: Nintendo has now confirmed to Eurogamer that Super Mario Wonder will not feature Charles Martinet, with new voice talent taking over in the roles of &quot;Mario and/or Luigi&quot;.

When asked why Martinet would no longer voice Mario, a Nintendo spokesperson told Eurogamer that &quot;this decision was made after carefully considering a variety of factors&quot;.

&quot;Regarding Super Mario Bros. Wonder, while Charles is not involved in the game, we&#x27;re excited to honour his legacy and contributions, including looking ahead to what he&#x27;ll be doing as a Mario Ambassador,&quot; a Nintendo spokesperson said.

                              <span>This month&#x27;s launch of the widely-celebrated Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 highlighted the often-overlooked topic of video game credits, and the fact that many people who work for hundreds of hours on a project sometimes still do not get their name recognised. But why does this happen? And what is being done - across developers, publishers, localisation companies and industry bodies - to ensure the situation improves?


I&#x27;ve spoken to staff past and present at Altagram, the company which was publicly highlighted for failing to list its freelance localisation staff in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 credits, as well as localisation freelancers and the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), to find out. 

Below, Altagram&#x27;s CEO also offers an explanation for what went wrong specifically with Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - something they claim was simply an innocent mistake, after Larian previously asked for freelancer names to be provided.

                              <span>Ironwood Studios has delayed its driving survival game Pacific Drive into early 2024.


The game was originally slated for 2023, but has been pushed back to prioritise the health of the team.


&quot;As many know, we&#x27;ve been hard at work bringing this idea to life for quite some time, and every day adds even more to a game we&#x27;re all proud of. In this final stretch however, it&#x27;s important to us that we stay true to ourselves, and not compromise on the team&#x27;s well being,&quot; reads a statement on X, formerly Twitter.

Your thumbs will certainly be happy as a new option has been added to remove button-mashing QTEs. To reel in the harpoon players need to button mash, which quickly gets tiring. Now you can select to hold the button instead.


Updates to the game&#x27;s UI include: adjusting the size particularly to support Steam Deck players; adding an inventory sorting function; and improved scrolling through vertical menus.

                              <span>IO Interactive has released a new update for Hitman: The World of Assassination. This update covers a large variety of issues, including that surprising &quot;death wall&quot; bug found on Hitman 2&#x27;s Isle of Sgail.


This bug saw poor, unexpecting NPCs dying instantly when they came into contact with a specific wall within the isolated North Atlantic castle. Which wall? Well, ironically one in the morgue. 


IO clearly didn&#x27;t want anything other than Agent 47 himself being responsible for the mysterious killings in Hitman, and therefore tried to fix the issue by adding some extra collision along the wall. However, this didn&#x27;t stop characters from dying instantly when they came into contact with the wall. So, instead, the Hitman team has, quite literally, boxed the wall in.

The social media exchange began with a post from one player claiming &quot;Lae&#x27;zel is the RPG party member equivalent of &#x27;the show gets really good after season four&#x27;&quot;. This was then shared - in a now-deleted post - by another user, adding if Lae&#x27;zel was male people would be swooning.


Gaider responded to this post, comparing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 to Dragon Age. &quot;Can confirm,&quot; he said. &quot;The Dragon Age fandom consistently gave WAY more latitude and forgiveness to male characters as opposed to female characters, in every game. It is very much a Thing.&quot;

This blog discusses two new features in Kubernetes 1.28 to improve Jobs for batch
users: Pod replacement policy
and Backoff limit per index.
These features continue the effort started by the
Pod failure policy
to improve the handling of Pod failures in a Job.
Pod replacement policy
By default, when a pod enters a terminating state (e.g. due to preemption or
eviction), Kubernetes immediately creates a replacement Pod. Therefore, both Pods are running
at the same time. In API terms, a pod is considered terminating when it has a
deletionTimestamp and it has a phase Pending or Running.
The scenario when two Pods are running at a given time is problematic for
some popular machine learning frameworks, such as
TensorFlow and JAX, which r…</span>

Former Blizzard developer Mark Kern tweeted a screenshot of Starfield&#x27;s start screen, saying: &quot;The physiognomy of start screens. The start screen of a game can reveal a lot about how rushed the team was and how much pride they took in their work. 

&quot;Starfield&#x27;s start screen either shows hasty shipping deadlines by a passionate team overworked, or a team that didn&#x27;t care.

All you need is one controller per player, and you can then add up to three additional people on the character-select screen. And yes, the Switch version launched with four-player co-op baked right in.

&quot;Today is a big day for our game as we are finally fulfilling half the game title: there are still no Vampires but at least there are SurvivorS now. We are adding a local co-op mode today!&quot; Poncle explains in the patch notes.

                              <span>Good news, Tomb Raider fans – rumour has it, &quot;breaking news&quot; is on the way.

As is usually the case with these kinds of things, we need to take it all with a very generous bucket of salt, but a recent update to the official Tomb Raider website is inviting players to sign up to be the &quot;first to hear&quot; about &quot;breaking news regarding the Tomb Raider franchise&quot;, including &quot;rewards, exclusives, merch, releases, and more&quot;.

So far, so what, right? Fair enough. However, pair the timing of the site&#x27;s sudden update with rumours that Crystal Dynamics was getting ready for a reveal later this year – which came from noted leaker Miller Ross, who accurately dropped information about Marvel&#x27;s Avengers ahead of schedule – and it&#x27;s enough to get Lara fans excited that the developer is gearing up to reveal a new game.

Setting sail at 3am UK time on 25th August (4am CEST; 7pm PT on 24th August in the US) and running until the 28th, the beta is only available on PC via Ubisoft Connect and is by invitation only. 

The beta test invites you to discover the red isle and the coast of Africa, wherein you&#x27;ll find the pirate den of Sainte Anne, which is &quot;ruled by John Scurlock, the local Kingpin&quot;. Here you&#x27;ll be able to interact with other players and NPCs, level up your weapons, ships, and equipment, as well as access your loot in your warehouse.

                              <span>Ghost-hunting sim Phasmophobia has just rolled out a hotfix to address some of the issues that crept in with its highly-anticipated Ascension update earlier this week.

The patch – which brings in an all-new levelling system at the cost of wiping out your progression, items, and virtual bank balance – rolled out on Thursday. Whilst it&#x27;s been welcomed by most of the community, a handful of issues – including performance woes and a problem with the falloff volume of ghosts, making hunts considerably trickier – have marred the launch.

Kinetic moved quickly to address reports raised by its community. For instance, one change includes shifting the Tier 3 lighter from a consumable item to a non-consumable one following player feedback, and another ensures that the T3 crucifix now has the correct five-metre radius.

                              <span>One of Call of Duty&#x27;s longest-serving developers, David Vonderhaar, has left Activision and Treyarch.

Vonderhaar announced his departure on LinkedIn, promising that after 18 years with the franchise, the &quot;energy&quot; of the Call of Duty community &quot;will always be a massive part of [him]&quot;.

&quot;Today, I am sharing that I have left Activision and Treyarch after an incredible 18 years and eight Call of Duty games,&quot; Vonderhaar wrote in his LinkedIn post yesterday. &quot;To my co-workers at Treyarch, I am immensely grateful for the time we invested working to improve our craft, never sitting on successes, and always wondering how to improve what we design and how we produce it.

                              <span>Blizzard has opened up about the impact Overwatch 2 &quot;review bombers&quot; have had on the team, acknowledging that the &quot;dissatisfaction&quot; stems from &quot;the cancellation of the much larger component of PvE that was announced in 2019 [...] that Blizzard ultimately couldn&#x27;t deliver&quot;.  

In a statement posted to the game&#x27;s official website, Aaron Keller said that while being review bombed &quot;isn&#x27;t a fun experience&quot;, the plan was to &quot;move forward&quot; by &quot;adding to and improving Overwatch 2&quot;.

In less than 48 hours after its Steam debut, Blizzard&#x27;s free-to-play hero shooter became Steam&#x27;s &quot;worst game of all time&quot;.

To celebrate the game being available to the public at next week&#x27;s Gamescom 2023 show, Sega has treated us to a 10-minute overview trailer and developer update, which you can check out below:

The trailer gives a little insight into the title&#x27;s &quot;gripping story&quot; featuring the legendary ex-yakuza Kazuma &quot;Joryu&quot; Kiryu, &quot;bone-crushing combat, mini-games (did someone say karaoke?) and other exciting experiences&quot;.

Whilst it had initially been set to end at 4pm UK / 8am PDT, Mortal Kombat&#x27;s co-creator and NetherRealm CCO, Ed Boon, confirmed on X/Twitter earlier today that the test has been extended by an additional seven hours. 

&quot;The Realms have spoken! We will be extending Pre-Order Beta for an additional 7 hours. The Beta will now conclude on Monday, 8/21 at 3:00pm PT,&quot; added the official Mortal Kombat Xitter account.

                              <span>Somewhat alarmingly, No Man&#x27;s Sky is now seven years old, and developer Hello Games is celebrating the exploratory space sim&#x27;s latest milestone with a brisk video retrospective and, probably of far more interest to fans, the tiniest of teases for the game&#x27;s next update. Really, it&#x27;s just the name they&#x27;ve announced, so don&#x27;t get your hopes up.


No Man&#x27;s Sky technically celebrated its birthday last Wednesday, 9th August, so I&#x27;m going to put Hello Games&#x27; delayed festivities down to too much jelly and ice cream; but regardless, studio boss Sean Murray has now popped up to briefly reflect on seven years of updates - which have taken No Man&#x27;s Sky from its rocky beginnings to the staggeringly rich sci-fi opus is it now - while I silently scream at the imperceptible sprint of time.


&quot;Seven years ago...we watched players all over the world begin to explore the universe we had created,&quot; Murray writes in a short message shared to belatedly mark No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s seventh anniversary. &quot;I can&#x27;t describe what that felt like. It was already the culmination of five previous years of very hard work for our tiny team.&quot;

                              <span>We recently spoke to Intel&#x27;s Tom &#x27;TAP&#x27; Petersen about updates to its DirectX 11 driver for Arc graphics cards and a new, entirely rebuilt version of its PresentMon tool for monitoring system performance. In short, these Arc GPUs continue to improve as Intel shore up support for older graphics APIs, with up to a 19 percentage point increase in average frame-rate in a selection of DX11 games with the release of the latest Arc driver, while the new version of PresentMon - available in beta now - offers some tantalising new possibilities for Digital Foundry and interested consumers alike. 
To start off, Intel says that they&#x27;ve now finished bringing over DX9 titles to their new driver, so now they&#x27;re moving onto DirectX 11 with a rearchitected driver. The way TAP explained it, the Intel graphics driver has historically thought of CPU performance as essentially infinite, because on a system with integrated graphics, you&#x27;re always going to be GPU-limited - so it makes sense to offload as much work as possible to the CPU to maximise frame-rates.
With Arc, that paradigm doesn&#x27;t make as much sense and the CPU often becomes the bottleneck, so the re-architecting has been about moving some functions back to the GPU, to lessen CPU load and improve overall performance.

                              <span>Frog Detective, developer Worm Club&#x27;s trilogy of endearingly daft sleuthing adventures, is making the leap to consoles - specifically PlayStation, Switch, Xbox (including Game Pass) - later this year, in the three-game collection appropriatley called The Entire Mystery.


Frog Detective first hopped onto PC back in 2018&#x27;s brisk The Haunted Island, wherein our sleuthing lead travelled to exotic climes to solve the mystery of a sloth-bothering ghost through a relaxed bit of clue hunting and suspect questioning. Its warm, silly demeanour soon attracted a bit of a cult following, and a sequel, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, arrived a year on.


And because nobody&#x27;s ever heard of a trilogy that stops at two, Frog Detective finally hung up his sleuthing hat (metaphorically at least - I haven&#x27;t played this one yet, so I&#x27;ve no idea how it ends) in one last adventure, 2023&#x27;s wild-west-themed Corruption at Cowboy County, which irrevocably changed the face of video games forever by adding a scooter.

                              <span>Twitch streamers will soon be able to block banned users from continuing to watch their live broadcasts.


Currently, a ban will only stop disruptive or abusive users from being able to communicate via Twitch chat. 


But that will change in September with an opt-in feature for all Twitch streamers to immediately cut their live feeds for anyone given a ban.

                              <span>The Making of Karateka, a new &quot;interactive documentary&quot; telling the story of Prince of Persia and The Last Express creator Jordan Mechner&#x27;s classic 1984 martial arts game, is launching for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation on 29th August, with a Switch version to follow in September.


It&#x27;s the work of Digital Eclipse, the studio behind last year&#x27;s acclaimed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, and promises a similarly styled delve into video gaming&#x27;s past, combining interviews, new video features, design documents, audio, and photos to create what the developer is calling the &quot;deepest, most exhaustive exploration of the making of a single video game that&#x27;s ever been attempted in a video game itself.&quot;


&quot;Jordan Mechner,&quot; the studio explains, &quot;was an 18-year-old college student when he started making the martial arts adventure that would become one of the most influential games of the Apple II era. The Making of Karateka presents the story behind Mechner&#x27;s first published game through an exhaustive archive...that can be explored at your own pace.&quot;

Previously, Tribute revealed Dimension Shellshock would add a new playable character in the form of the Ninja Turtles&#x27; occasional ally Miyamoto Usagi - who originally made the jump from his own Usagi Yojimbo comic series into the turtles&#x27; world back in 1987 - and the developer has now unveiled a second playable character: the former Foot Clan member, Karai.


&quot;Karai&#x27;s signature snark brings a bite to the fight alongside her deadly skills with her swift ninjutsu strikes,&quot; publisher Dotemu explains in its release date annoucement. &quot;With Karai at your side there&#x27;s no stopping the Turtles as they kick, punch and party their way across the various new worlds in Dimension Shellshock&#x27;s rift-jumping battles.&quot;

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 developer Larian has said it&#x27;s &quot;changing the way we deploy patches&quot; after it was forced to rollback yesterday&#x27;s Hotfix #4 due to crashing issues - a move that temporarily prevented players from accessing any saves made during the time the update was deployed.


Understandably, the rollback caused consternation among affected players, and now, in a message accompanying today&#x27;s redeployment of Hotfix #4 on PC, Larian says, &quot;We recognise the frustration caused by this and want to apologise. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re changing things up.&quot;


First, though, it offered context for yesterday&#x27;s bungled release, explaining, &quot;Hotfix #4 went through a rigorous QA pipeline and was confirmed as a candidate for release yesterday. However, we triggered a rebuild of the version relatively last minute to change the version number. The version that was cooked was unfortunately plagued by compiler corruption, which was causing certain exceptions that normally wouldn&#x27;t cause crashes to - you guessed it - cause crashes.&quot; Larian calls these kinds of compiler issues &quot;extremely rare&quot;, adding, &quot;We weren&#x27;t prepared for it. We should&#x27;ve been. We messed up.&quot;

                              <span>Following its odd little pre-amble last night, Activision and developer Sledgehammer have given Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 the full reveal treatment, sharing first details on its campaign, multiplayer, and zombies mode, alongside a brief look at the game in action.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which launches this November, is a direct sequel to last year&#x27;s Infinity Ward developed Modern Warfare 2, pitting Captain Price and Task Force 141 against recurring antagonist Vladimir Makarov, who continues to extend his grasp across the world.


Starting with its campaign, Call of Duty&#x27;s familiar cinematic missions will be joined by what Activision is calling Open Combat Missions, which are intended as more open-ended objectives, featuring multiple paths and approaches, that emphasise player choice. These will take place &quot;across the sizeable landscape of a mission&#x27;s AO &quot; and &quot;adapt to different playstyles&quot;, from stealth to run-and-gun action, so &quot;players can truly play how they want.&quot;

Abstract: For nearly two decades, CAPTCHAS have been widely used as a means of protection against bots. Throughout the years, as their use grew, techniques to defeat or bypass CAPTCHAS have continued to improve. Meanwhile, CAPTCHAS have also evolved in terms of sophistication and diversity, becoming increasingly difficult to solve for both bots (machines) and humans. Given this long-standing and still-ongoing arms race, it is critical to investigate how long it takes legitimate users to solve modern CAPTCHAS, and how they are perceived by those users...</span>

Announcing graduation to General Availability (GA) - Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment in Kubernetes v1.28!
Kubernetes SIG Storage team is thrilled to announce that the &quot;Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment&quot; feature,
introduced as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.25, has now graduated to GA and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.28 release.
This enhancement brings a significant improvement to how default
StorageClasses are assigned to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
With this feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and then a PVC to assign the class.
Instead, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned will now be retroactively updated to include the default StorageClass.
This enhancement ensures that PVCs no longer get stuck in an unbound state, and storage provisioning works seamlessly,
even when a default StorageClass is not defined at the time of PVC creation.
What changed?
The PersistentVolume (PV) controller has been modified to automatically assign a default StorageClass to any unbound
PersistentVolumeClaim with the storageClassName not set. Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim
admission validation mechanism within
the API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.
How to use it?
As this feature has graduated to GA, there&#x27;s no need to enable a feature gate anymore.
Simply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.
For more details, read about
default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.

                              <span>I&#x27;m watching Jesus on Twitch. He&#x27;s a bearded white man answering philosophical (and not so philosophical) questions from the chat. Just type out a question and Jesus will answer.


Of course, Jesus is an AI. At one point, he even admits he&#x27;s &quot;not the physical Jesus&quot;, so at least he sounds self aware. The channel states it was made possible due to contributions from The Singularity Group - not a Christian organisation - and tech from PlayHT, an AI-powered voice generation platform that replicates celebrity voices.


Whose face and voice is used for AI Jesus? It&#x27;s unclear. Is it entertaining? Sort of. Is this really the sort of content Twitch should be used for? Debatable.

                              <span>The creator of a GTA AI mod has had their mod shutdown entirely by Take-Two.


Earlier this week we reported on the Sentient Streets mods for GTA 5 created by Bloc, which uses AI to generate free conversations with NPCs.



Now, the mod&#x27;s NexusMods listing and a YouTube video showcasing its gameplay have both been made unavailable due to copyright claims by publisher Take-Two. Sentient Streets is no longer available to download.

                              <span>EA says it will not contest a €10.8k (£9.2k) fine laid down by an Austrian court that decided FIFA Ultimate Team packs constituted a breach of the country&#x27;s gambling laws. 


Naturally, EA says it still disagrees with the verdict.


This decision will likely have no wider impact, GamesIndustry.biz reports, as Austrian courts rule on individual cases without a need for their impact to be felt in subsequent cases.

                              <span>Deathloop will leave Sony&#x27;s PS Plus service next month, along with seven other games.


The Bethesda game will therefore leave the service a year after it joined, and two years after it was first released. The game also launched on Game Pass last year, where it will remain across both Xbox Series X/S and PC.


PlayStation owners have until 19th September to break the loop.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Mazin was asked how many seasons the show would likely need to tell all of its story. In response, Mazin stated that &quot;four seems like a good number&quot;. 


&quot;You never know,&quot; he said. &quot;It can end up being three or five. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we&#x27;re telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more.&quot;

&quot;Due to a build error causing new crashes, we&#x27;ve rolled back Hotfix 4 for the time being. We&#x27;ll re-release it as soon as we&#x27;ve fixed the cause,&quot; reads the statement.

                              <span>UPDATE 11.15am UK: Hyenas publisher Sega has stopped short of confirming the game has transitioned to a free-to-play business model when questioned by Eurogamer about the &quot;adjustments&quot; being made.

&quot;We have dedicated the past year to reviewing our business model alongside months of extremely valuable player testing of the gameplay experience,&quot; a Sega spokesperson told me. 

&quot;We&#x27;re very excited with this progress and the reaction to yesterday&#x27;s gameplay reveal. We&#x27;ll build on that foundation with our Closed Beta test beginning 31st August and use this insight to finalise our plans for launch.&quot;

                              <span>Starfield&#x27;s hype handle cranks ever-more furiously in the run-up to its September release, and Bethesda has now fired out a scattershot volley of fresh details, courtesy of a new Discord Q&amp;A.


Subjects tackled are inevitably rather chaotically broad (and, alas, disappointingly sandwich-free), guided as they were by fans with radically differing concerns, but the end is still a fascinating peek into a game that remains a little enigmatic so close to launch.


We now, for instance, know (thanks Games8) that Starfield will feature various possible punishments for those caught doing naughty things like smuggling contraband. Illegal goods are frowned upon across the galaxy (which is said to operates within a fixed economy, although buy and sell prices can be influenced with certain skills), and must be smuggled past security ships orbiting major settlements by stuffing them inside special purchasable ship modules.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t worry PS5 owners, you too get some preload news today! Developer Larian has revealed that Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 preloads will begin for the console on 31st August. Additionally, the studio has now release Hotfix #4 for PC players, meaning everybody&#x27;ll soon be able to enjoy the stupendous CRPG a little more bug-free.


Starting with preloads, the exact date when PlayStation 5 users can start cramming Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 onto their SSDs depends on the version they&#x27;ve pre-purchased. Those who&#x27;ve opted for the Digital Deluxe Edition can start clogging their internet pipe from 5pm BST on 31st August, ahead of the game&#x27;s early access launch on 2nd September.


Owners of the standard edition, meanwhile, can begin preloading Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 (which weighs in at around 122GB on PC, so it&#x27;s not an insignificant download) from 4th September at 5pm BST, 48 hours before its 6th September general release.

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s official Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 unveiling, Activision has shared a few initial details - including talk of a new Perks system and a whole lot of zombies - ahead of a more substantial in-game reveal within Warzone tomorrow, 17th August.


As its name implies, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a direct sequel to last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 (and not a direct sequel to 2009&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2, which would just be odd), promising the return of &quot;iconic heroes and villains alike&quot;.


We already know that players will be able to bring their Modern Warfare 2 inventory and weapons progression into this year&#x27;s Sledgehammer-developer sequel, but now Activision has teased a few additional details, including the return of Modern Warfare Zombies mode, which is described as the &quot;largest Zombies offering to date.&quot;

The Kubernetes Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature is now GA in Kubernetes v1.28.
It was introduced as
alpha
in Kubernetes v1.24, and promoted to
beta
in Kubernetes v1.26.
This feature allows stateful workloads to restart on a different node if the
original node is shutdown unexpectedly or ends up in a non-recoverable state
such as the hardware failure or unresponsive OS.
What is a Non-Graceful Node Shutdown
In a Kubernetes cluster, a node can be shutdown in a planned graceful way or
unexpectedly because of reasons such as power outage or something else external.
A node shutdown could lead to workload failure if the node is not drained
before the shutdown. A node shutdown can be either graceful or non-graceful.

The hugely anticipated Starfield - an ambitious mash-up of Garfield and Stars in Their Eyes - is still a little way off, of course, launching for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 6th September. Impatient sorts with languorous internet connects can, however, begin the potentially lengthy process of downloading its 125GB of space-fun well in advance as per today&#x27;s announcement.


Those looking to play Starfield on Xbox Series X/S or on PC via the Windows Store can get their pre-load going starting tomorrow, 17th August, while Steam users will need to wait a little longer; Bethesda says preloads via Valve&#x27;s store will begin on Wednesday, 30th August.

                              <span>Hyenas, the upcoming extraction shooter where teams race to secure pop culture memorabilia, has resurfaced today with word of an imminent closed beta test.


It&#x27;s been a little while since we&#x27;ve heard something on Hyenas&#x27; development, and it feels a long time since the project was first publicly confirmed a year ago, back in August 2022, following an early alpha test footage leak.


Now, you&#x27;ll soon be able to play it for yourself - via a PC closed beta test running from 31st August to 11th September. Interested? You can register now via Steam.

This year, however, it included a curious music choice: the opening bombing mission from Final Fantasy 7.


It&#x27;s an ironic choice considering the fairly obvious anti-military themes of that particular mission and the game overall.

                              <span>Rocksteady has announced the release date for the Switch version of its Batman: Arkham Trilogy, out 13th October.


That&#x27;s a Friday: unlucky for some, though not for Batman fans and Switch owners as this is the first time the games will be available on Nintendo&#x27;s console.


As announced in its initial reveal in June&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the trilogy will comprise Arkham Asylum, Arkham City and Arkham Knight with all DLC.

                              <span>American Truck Simulator&#x27;s Oklahoma expansion might only just have arrived, but the sim&#x27;s ceaseless trundle across the United States continues on, with developer SCS Software confirming Nebraska is currently one of several future state expansions in development.


Nebraska will arrive sometime after the launch of American Truck Simulator&#x27;s upcoming Kansas expansion, which was announced as the sim&#x27;s next DLC, and its 14th explorable state, earlier this year. So far, since American Truck Simulator&#x27;s arrival back in 2016, SCS has released digital reimaginings of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and the recently launched Oklahoma.


Kansas is next, and, as detailed in a blog shared shortly after Oklahoma arrival, Nebraska - which continues American Truck Simulator&#x27;s by now fairly predictable west to east, south to north expansion across the US - will eventually bring the number of playable states up to 15.

                              <span>Geoff Keighley has moved to temper expectations ahead of next week&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live, saying this year&#x27;s show will be &quot;less about announcing brand-new projects&quot;.


Next week will mark the fifth consecutive year the glitzy, Keighley-hosted Opening Night Live has launched Cologne&#x27;s Gamescom trade fair, and speaking to VGC ahead of big day, Keighley described this year&#x27;s opener as an &quot;exciting show with new looks at many announced upcoming games like Alan Wake 2, and Black Myth Wukong&quot;.


However, those anticipating an evening of explosive video game megaton reveals should probably keep their expectations in check. Keighley added, &quot;This year&#x27;s Opening Night Live is less about announcing brand-new projects, and more about giving fans updates on some of the biggest games due out over the next year.&quot;

We worked with external security experts and the National Cyber Security Centre to investigate and secure our systems.

If the hack was by a major government, the odds are really low that it has resecured its systems—unless it burned the network to the ground and rebuilt it from scratch (which seems unlikely).</span>

On behalf of Kubernetes SIG Release, I am very excited to introduce the
Kubernetes community-owned software
repositories for Debian and RPM packages: pkgs.k8s.io! The new package
repositories are replacement for the Google-hosted package repositories
(apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io) that we&#x27;ve been using since
Kubernetes v1.5.
This blog post contains information about these new package repositories,
what does it mean to you as an end user, and how to migrate to the new
repositories.
What you need to know about the new package repositories?
This is an opt-in change; you&#x27;re required to manually migrate from the
Google-hosted repository to the Kubernetes community-owned repositories.
See how to migrate later in this announcement for migration infor…</span>

                              <span>After six years, Destiny 2&#x27;s concluding expansion, The Final Shape, is almost in sight, with a launch expected early next year. Right now, its innards remains mysterious, but that&#x27;ll change next week when Bungie shares first details in a newly announced livestream.


Things get underway next Tuesday, 22nd August, at 4pm BST/8am PT via Twich, YouTube, and TikTok, with a one-hour pre-show. The show proper begins an hour later, bringing details of The Final Shape expansion, Destiny 2&#x27;s Season 22, its next reprised raid, and more.


Bungie says the main show will then be followed by a live post-show, featuring a roundtable developer discussion focusing on what players can expect to see over the coming year for Destiny 2. Those viewing via Twitch, incidentally, can get an exclusive emblem by watching for any 30 minutes between the start of the showcase and the end of the post-show.

                              <span>Xbox is introducing a new enforcement strike system, adding transparency to its safety systems.


From today, every enforcement of bad behaviour will have a strike attached with an appropriate severity.


The maximum severity, after eight strikes, will be a year&#x27;s suspension from Xbox social features like multiplayer, messaging, parties, and party chat.

That&#x27;s the aim of Sentient Streets, a new story-based GTA 5 mod by veteran mod creator Bloc, available now on NexusMods.


In it, players take on the role of a rookie cop investigating a conspiracy in Los Santos concerning the rise of AI. Back in real life, meanwhile, it&#x27;s AI that powers the mod&#x27;s conversations with NPCs throughout the world.

This month continues the theme of great indies, with some popular titles both joining and leaving the service.

                              <span>Modders have created Lone Wolf modes for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, allowing players to solo the game without companions.


I&#x27;ve spotted two Lone Wolf mods on NexusMods, both inspired by the perk of the same name in Divinity: Original Sin 2 to boost solo play.


The first, from fenix aka sp8cemonkey83, adds one additional Action charge, 30 percent more hit points, 50 percent more carrying capacity, 1d4 bonus to all d20 rolls, and more frequent use of weapon actions (per battle, rather than per short rest).

                              <span>Following the release of its iOS controller app, Netflix has started to roll out a &quot;limited&quot; beta test to stream its games via your TV.

Netflix announced the beta in a blog post which detailed plans to stream to TV screens as well as PC and Mac.

At present, only two games are part of the beta - Oxenfree, which was developed by Night School Studio (acquired by Netflix in 2021), and a brand new title called Molehew&#x27;s Mining Adventure, described as a &quot;gem-mining arcade game&quot;.

                              <span>Bethesda has laid down some of Starfield&#x27;s backstory, detailing the events which take us from 2023 to 2330 - when the game&#x27;s story is set. 

Bethesda&#x27;s timeline begins in 2050, when humans first arrive on Mars. Such a date is relatively consistent with NASA&#x27;s own estimates of when humanity will touch down on the Red Planet, after returning to the Moon later this decade.


After that, Bethesda jumps forward 56 years to humanity&#x27;s 2156 arrival in Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Sun. And it&#x27;s here we really start to enter science fiction.

                              <span>The ability to change the appearance of your character in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is &quot;being cooked&quot;, developer Larian has stated.

Imagine you&#x27;ve spent two hours in the character creator sculpting a face for your character, only to watch the first cutscene and realise that actually, you regret those design choices. It&#x27;s a modern horror story.

If this is your experience in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 at the moment then you&#x27;re stuck with your character - unless you decide to restart the game - because there&#x27;s no way to customise their appearance past the character creation stage. Hopefully, that won&#x27;t be the case for much longer, now Larian is working on bringing an editing feature to the game.

                              <span>Square Enix has released a short blog post celebrating the 20th anniversary of GameCube classic Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, in which the game&#x27;s producer has said fans should &quot;trust that one day a brand-new chapter will be added to their adventure&quot;.


Writing to acknowledge the game&#x27;s 8th August anniversary, producer Akitoshi Kawazu seemed eager to work on a fresh title in the series.


&quot;Personally, I feel regret for not being able to satisfy the fans who have been holding out hope for an all-new FFCC game,&quot; Kawazu said. &quot;While there&#x27;s so much I&#x27;d like to do, I just can&#x27;t find the time to do it all. I know that the characters deserve to shine again, yet I&#x27;ve been unable to provide them with another adventure.&quot;

The world record time was achieved by speedrunner Mae, who&#x27;s uploaded their Any% speedrun to YouTube with a time of 10 minutes and three seconds.


How is this achieved? With Gale and a whole load of jumping. I guess that explains his name, then. Some spoilers follow.

                              <span>A new report from Axios has shed fresh light on Embracer Group&#x27;s mysterious $2bn &quot;major strategic partnership&quot; which collapsed spectacularly back in May, causing its shares to drop by 40 percent and sending the company into cost-cutting mode.


At the time, Embracer - the enormous umbrella corporation which owns more than 100 studios including Borderlands developer Gearbox, publishing groups such as THQ Nordic, Koch Media and Saber Interactive, and franchises such as Tomb Raider and Deus Ex - explained it had reached a verbal commitment in October 2022 that would have resulted in more than $2bn &quot;in contracted development revenue over a period of six years.&quot; However, at the 11th hour, Embracer said it &quot;received a negative outcome from the counterparty&quot;.


While Embracer declined to confirm who its proposed partner was at the time of its announcement, a new report from Axios, citing &quot;four sources familiar with the deal&quot;, claims it was the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group, the gaming-focused arm of the Saudi investment fund set up by the hugely controversial Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Axios says the proposed deal would have seen $2bn being invested in the development and publishing of games from Embracer, but adds its sources were &quot;less certain about why Savvy walked away&quot;.

Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Brazil account on X, formerly Twitter, yesterday posted a Father&#x27;s Day message featuring celebrated dads in gaming from various Xbox titles - and also one other: Barrett from Final Fantasy 7 Remake.


The post was then swiftly deleted, causing fans to speculate that perhaps the game may have been included as a tease for it appearing on Xbox consoles (thanks, The Gamer).

                              <span>Ubisoft has changed the release date of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, which will now arrive on Thursday, 5th October.


That&#x27;s a week sooner than its previous launch date, which was set for 12th October. 


The move means Mirage will now have more of a gap between its October launch and some of the many other games due in the same month: Lords of the Fallen, Alan Wake 2, Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Wonder.

However, Honolulu has proven a controversial choice.

Using hacked Pokémon is technically against the rules, but players haven&#x27;t always been caught. However, at this year&#x27;s tournament in Yokohama, Japan, the rules were seemingly tightened and many players who travelled across the world were disqualified.


As a result, the community has been debating whether using hacked teams is an acceptable method of saving time, or if it&#x27;s against the spirit of the monster training games.

Creative director Chris Esaki revealed Turn 10 has omitted the features during the latest Forza Monthly livestream, and explained why each was not available in the game.

The 2020 penetration was so disturbing that Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, and Matthew Pottinger, who was White House deputy national security adviser at the time, raced to Tokyo.

Welcome to the world of Kubernetes and its vibrant contributor
community! In this blog post, we&#x27;ll be shining a spotlight on the
Special Interest Group for Contributor
Experience
(SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project.
SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and
maintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the
project. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may
hinder the project&#x27;s growth and feature velocity, such as pull request
latency and the number of open pull requests and issues.
SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by
creating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that
facilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They

No, I&#x27;m not talking about the record-breaking movie starring Chris Pratt and Jack Black – I&#x27;m talking about the infamous 1993 live-action offering starring Bob Hoskins.

In honour of the movie&#x27;s 30th anniversary – and no doubt buoyed by the animated movie&#x27;s recent success – on 15th September 2023, Japanese audiences will be treated to a 4K re-release of the cult classic, which was called Super Mario: Goddess of the Demon Empire locally.

                              <span>In the wake of our reporting on PlayStation 5&#x27;s new Dolby Atmos support in last week&#x27;s DF Direct Weekly, Sony&#x27;s marketing team got in touch with a response from PS5 lead system architect, Mark Cerny, on how the new surround sound set-up actually works. In the Direct, we speculated that the PS5&#x27;s existing, very impressive Tempest 3D audio data was most likely being recalculated and injected into the Dolby Atmos &#x27;container&#x27;.
If you think about it, this is an innovative solution but it&#x27;s also the only way that the PS5&#x27;s existing library of titles can actually work with Atmos set-ups as until now, developers would not have mastered audio to support the 7.1.4 speaker system. 
In his statement, Mark Cerny takes us through the entire audio pipeline in PlayStation 5 and how support has been extended to accommodate the extra speakers that an Atmos set-up supplies. The nature of Sony&#x27;s solution means that the Atmos support is entirely lag-free, in contrast to some issues we&#x27;ve had with Xbox and Windows PCs. Is this solution actually an Atmos mix though? It&#x27;s &#x27;as good as&#x27; from a mathematical perspective, but with full support now added, sound engineers can master their audio mixes on full Atmos-spec equipment, meaning there&#x27;s scope for further improvement.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 players believe they&#x27;ve identified an issue &quot;halfway through Act 3&quot;, which some believe hint at &quot;a weird error with the way [Larian has] designed the whole narrative progression&quot;.

In a post on the official subreddit that has racked up hundreds of up-votes, u/Neville_Lynwood has identified that although lots of players prefer to avoid Long Rests, failure to do so can impede progress, as Larian has &quot;a lot of events, companion quests, romances, side characters, and even main story events to you having a Long Rest&quot;.

Neville_Lynwood points out that whilst &quot;thematically [it] makes sense&quot; to Long Rest in order to &quot;reflect on stuff that has happened&quot;, we&#x27;re all essentially &quot;de-incentivised&quot; from doing so because you lose your temporary buffs and elixirs… which is a problem, given some think that a lack of rest results in &quot;breaking the narrative progression which leads to event flags and triggers getting jumbled&quot;, leading to &quot;all kinds of bugs&quot;.

&quot;When people make these silly threats, I and everyone at FGC suffer the following losses,&quot; Harada said, and then detailed the impact &quot;silly&quot; threats have.

                              <span>Rockstar has hired the team behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and RDR2 RedM multiplayer mods, Cfx.re – the same team that been banned from playing the game back in 2015.

The studio announced the news on the company&#x27;s website and social media channels, stating that it was &quot;proud&quot; to welcome the team to Rockstar Games.

The news is particularly surprising given the modders were banned from the game back in 2015. Despite attempting to comply with Rockstar&#x27;s rules - which stated that modding of the developer&#x27;s official GTA Online mode will face the banhammer - and making their own multiplayer service away from GTA Online, Rockstar banned them anyway.

                              <span>FC Barcelona has renewed its partnership with Konami, making the Japanese developer the &quot;official football video game partner of the Catalan club&quot;.

The renewal means that the Spanish champions remain as one of the &quot;core clubs&quot; featured in Konami&#x27;s free-to-play football series, eFootball, which, of course, started life a long time ago as the premium football game, Pro Evolution Soccer (PES).

The formal partnership means Konami retains &quot;multiple rights&quot; with the football team, including &quot;player access, media opportunities, and event exposure&quot;. For players, this means you&#x27;ll be able to power up your Dream Team with three new Epic cards for the FC Barcelona legends Rivaldo, Patrick Kluivert, and Javier Saviola – you have until 17th August to claim them – and be able to play on the hallowed turf of the Camp Nou (even if the real players can&#x27;t right now).

That&#x27;s according to Holmes&#x27; own LinkedIn page, which now reveals that as of August 2023, he&#x27;s been promoted from the franchise&#x27;s brand narrative lead into the director&#x27;s chair.

                              <span>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl looks set to release on 1st December, 2023.

That&#x27;s according to distributor Plaion (formerly known as Koch Media), which is listing a firm release date of 1st December on its website, even though a release date has not yet been confirmed by development studio GSC Game World, which is also self-publishing the first-person shooter survival horror game.

As noted by Andrew Marmo (thanks, wccftech), who spotted the listing, it seems unlikely that this is a placeholder, as the website is listing other games with no firm release window with the placeholder date of 31st December, 2023.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s public beta will first be available to PlayStation users.

That&#x27;s according to an advert taken from Sony&#x27;s Arabic&#x27;s YouTube channel, which reportedly said that players can &quot;play the demo first on PlayStation&quot; &quot;at least five days before any other platform&quot;. 

As spotted and translated by Call of Duty specialist CharlieIntel - and as is usually the case these days - you&#x27;ll only be able to participate in the first beta if you&#x27;ve pre-ordered the game first.

                              <span>It was only released on Steam two days ago, but Overwatch 2 is already breaking records, albeit probably not the ones Blizzard was hoping for. In just 48 hours, the free-to-play hero shooter has become Steam&#x27;s &quot;worst game of all time&quot;.

Despite peaking at around 75K players and amassing thousands of reviews, the shooter has leapt to the top of Steam&#x27;s chart of the worst-received games after review bombers awarded it an aggregate user score of around 1.09, making it the &quot;worst reviewed&quot; game on Steam, according to Steam250&#x27;s Hall of Shame.

Whilst the game&#x27;s delayed arrival on Steam was a celebration for some, players have come en masse to leave scathing user reviews, complaining about all manner of things, from the lack of content, pricey cosmetic skins, and balance issues. Others are just annoyed it&#x27;s not Team Fortress 2.

                              <span>Mediterranea Inferno, the &quot;mature and treacherous&quot; summer adventure from Lorenzo Redaelli, the creator of The Milky Way Prince - Vampire star, is coming to Steam on 24th August.


Mediterranea Inferno, which is being published by the ever-wonderful Santa Ragione (Saturnalia, MirrorMoon EP), tells the story of three young men in their early 20s who reunite for a sensual summer retreat in southern Italy after some time apart during the isolation of the COVID pandemic, hoping to rekindle their friendship.


&quot;A lazy afternoon by the pool, a lustful night at the club, or even a morbid visit to the local cemetery,&quot; explains Mediterranea Inferno&#x27;s Steam page, &quot;you&#x27;ll decide how to spend this summer vacation, but wherever you go, something or someone will be waiting, offering an additional, forbidden trip through the arcane inner spaces of conscience.&quot;

                              <span>THQ Nordic&#x27;s annual digital showcase has been and gone for another year, and while there were plenty of familiar faces returning from 2022&#x27;s outing, it did bring a couple of new reveals. The publisher&#x27;s South Park game finally got a proper unveiling in the form of Snow Day, for instance, and was followed by announcements for the likes of Titan Quest 2 and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin. For a full recap of everything shown, do read on.

South Park: Snow Day!

Eschewing the cartoon&#x27;s classic construction paper looks in favour of boring old 3D, South Park: Snow Day is a co-op adventure that sees up to four players - in the roles of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, naturally - enjoying their day away from school by battling through the snow-blanketed South Park streets on a quest to save the world. There&#x27;s no release date for this one yet (expect to read this a lot as the recap presses on), but it&#x27;s coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch some time next year.

                              <span>Results from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research Limited annual squid survey:
This year, the team unearthed spectacular large hooked squids, weighing about 15kg and sitting at 2m long, a Taningia—­which has the largest known light organs in the animal kingdom­—and a few species that remain very rare in collections worldwide, such as the “scaled” squid Lepidoteuthis and the Batoteuthis skolops.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                              <span>Substantiating a Bloomberg report from earlier this year, Netflix has quietly released a new &quot;game controller&quot; app for iOS intended to make it possible for subscribers to play its games on their TV. The major wrinkle in all this, however, is that it currently doesn&#x27;t actually do anything.


As spotted by TechCrunch, the Netflix Game Controller app (as it&#x27;s official known) slipped onto the iOS App Store with zero fanfare, and zero official word from Netflix, earlier this week. Thankfully, there&#x27;s little mystery surrounding its purpose; the app comes with a full description explaining, &quot;Play games on your TV with the Netflix Game Controller. This Game Controller app pairs with your TV and allows you to play games on Netflix using your phone or mobile device.&quot;


Netflix&#x27;s description also clearly notes the feature is &quot;coming soon&quot;, and indeed, downloading the app and firing it up doesn&#x27;t do much at all. It does offer up a message informing users, &quot;To begin, choose a game on your TV and follow the directions to connect&quot;, but with no matching functionally currently built into the main Netflix app, that&#x27;s as far as things go.

In particular, 368 players managed to complete the game in the opening weekend. How? I have no idea - this game is incredibly long and in-depth.


It all begins with character creation, of course, which is what most of these stats consider.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a week since Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 released in full on PC and already there are a whole host of mods available, aimed at both aiding combat and character development - or potentially breaking the game.


As a newbie to both Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and D&amp;D, I&#x27;ve found the game a little impenetrable so far (but still enjoyable!) and combat is certainly tricky. So, I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;ve been eyeing up some mods to help out.


So, here are ten mods to help out in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - available now on NexusMods. Just beware, they may end up ruining the balance.

                              <span>What better way to find out if a prospective candidate has knowledge of your game than to launch a job interview process within the game itself?


Metaverse-y game hub Roblox has now done just this, and launched a virtual company career centre where keen applicants can turn up for event, podcasts and conversations with existing employees. 


For now, the experience is designed for candidates in junior roles, with the idea that it will appeal to those who played Roblox as they were growing up.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 features some fantastic companion characters, all wonderfully voiced throughout the game. It really adds to its immersion.


But perhaps the most underrated character is the narrator, acting as the DM and narrating the story with typical second-person phrasing. Far from a blank narration, there&#x27;s plenty of personality in the delivery.


That&#x27;s thanks to voice actor Amelia Tyler, who&#x27;s been sharing hilarious outtakes over on her YouTube channel.

                              <span>The upcoming Lollipop Chainsaw remake has been delayed from 2023 to the summer of 2024.


Developer Dragami Games announced the delay today, alongside a fresh name for the project: Lollipop Chainsaw RePop.


Dragami blamed the delay on a need to ensure the game reached &quot;the best possible quality experience&quot;, something which required it to &quot;extend the development period&quot;.

The hit RPG is playable in four-player co-op, which fills out the party and leaves no room for companions like Lae&#x27;zel, Astarion, and Gale and means players could miss out on their unique stories.


Vincke, however, has suggested not interacting with companions and saving them instead for solo play.

                              <span>Acid Wizard Studios - the developer behind 2017&#x27;s stupendous top-down survival horror Darkwood - has announced an indefinite, years-long hiatus, just months after unveiling its first new game in half a decade, Soccer Kids.


Darkwood initially released into Steam early access back in 2014, quickly becoming a horror favourite with its strange, oppressive atmosphere and strikingly effective presentation, but following its full release in 2017 and a period of patching, Acid Wizard all but vanished.


The Polish studio finally resurfaced earlier this year, explaining in a blog post shared in June that its absence was a result of Darkwood&#x27;s intense five-year development which, it said, &quot;took a toll on us, both mentally and physically.&quot; That necessitated an extended break, after which the studio was ready to think about its next game, and while a Darkwood sequel was considered, &quot;the memory of the inhuman amount of work put into Darkwood was still there&quot;.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, the cheerful tycoon game with a thing for DNA splicing, is almost ready to swim with the fishes; its previously announced Aquarium Odyssey DLC finally has a release date and will be making a splash on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch next Thursday, 17th August.


Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, for the uninitiated, combines familiar zoo management - where the goal is to build and maintain an appealing, lucrative park by importing and breeding animals, managing staff, and so on - with some unusual twists. There&#x27;s a morality system - meaning you can either strive for ethical excellence or just go all-in on, you know, handbag manufacturing - as well as the kind of science-run-amok that would make the Jurassic Park boffins blush.


Essentially, any of the many animals available in-game can be DNA spliced with a second to create a dependably bizarre hybrid, which, helpfully, tends to be quite popular with the visitors. You could science-up a crocoduck, for instance, or a giraffephant, or a chickow.

Flame Fatales gets underway this Sunday, 13th August, at 5.30pm BST. That marks the start of a half-hour pre-show, but things kick off proper at 6pm with cyanidesugar&#x27;s Any% Story Mode speedrun of Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin.


From then on, the speedrunning schedule continues apace, taking a break in the early hours each day before resuming around 5pm BST. All good things must come to an end, of course, and proceedings officially conclude at approximately 6am on Sunday, 20th August.

                              <span>With QuakeCon 2023 now underway, id Software&#x27;s much-rumoured Quake 2 remaster has finally been made official - and it&#x27;s out now for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, and Game Pass.


As with 2021&#x27;s similarly styled Quake 1 remaster, this enhanced version of the sequel has been handled by retro specialists Nightdive Studios. Its list of additions is extensive too, including enhanced models and cinematics, dynamic and coloured lighting, improved enemy animations and gore, &quot;improved and restored&quot; AI behaviour, new accessibility features, plus anti-aliasing, depth of field, and support for widescreen resolutions up to 4K. And, of course, Sonic Mayhem&#x27;s original soundtrack returns in all its furious glory.


And as with 2021&#x27;s Quake 1 remaster, id has put together an impressively generous package, incorporating Quake 2&#x27;s base game, as well as its two expansions - The Reckoning and Ground Zero - which, between then, bring 33 additional campaign levels and 21 new multiplayer deathmatch maps. Furthermore, it includes a brand-new expansion, Call of the Machine, from Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games, introducing a further 28 campaign levels and one new deathmatch map.

                              <span>Destiny developer Bungie has discussed how it plans to continue the character of Commander Zavala following the death of voice actor Lance Reddick earlier this year. 


In a blog post published today, Bungie said that Zavala was &quot;central&quot; to Destiny&#x27;s story, and that the character will continue to remain prominent for years to come.


Henceforth, Zavala&#x27;s English voice lines will be provided by veteran actor Keith David, starting with next year&#x27;s climactic expansion The Final Shape - &quot;and beyond&quot;.

                              <span>Really interesting “systematization of knowledge” paper:
“SoK: The Ghost Trilemma”
Abstract: Trolls, bots, and sybils distort online discourse and compromise the security of networked platforms. User identity is central to the vectors of attack and manipulation employed in these contexts. However it has long seemed that, try as it might, the security community has been unable to stem the rising tide of such problems. We posit the Ghost Trilemma, that there are three key properties of identity—sentience, location, and uniqueness—that cannot be simultaneously verified in a fully-decentralized setting. Many fully-decentralized systems—whether for communication or social coordination—grapple with this trilemma in some way, perhaps unknowingly. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we examine the design space, use cases, problems with prior approaches, and possible paths forward. We sketch a proof of this trilemma and outline options for practical, incrementally deployable schemes to achieve an acceptable tradeoff of trust in centralized trust anchors, decentralized operation, and an ability to withstand a range of attacks, while protecting user privacy...</span>

                              <span>Altagram, the translation company which was found to have not credited staff who worked for years on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, has issued a lengthy public apology and a list of commitments to change.


In a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, Altagram said that it had &quot;come to our attention that the omission of translator credits from our contribution to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has generated frustration and disappointment among the freelance translator community&quot;. 


Disappointment in the lack of creditation was initially directed at Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 developer Larian. But in an exclusive statement given to Eurogamer yesterday, Larian said Altagram had failed to provide a full list of names, and that it was now working to ensure these were all added to the game in a forthcoming patch.

                              <span>The new Lords of the Fallen is shaping up pretty nicely, and it&#x27;s certainly a looker in terms of pure detail. Some followers of the upcoming Soulslike, however, have been curious about how it&#x27;ll run on their hardware, ever since developer Hexworks revealed some relatively high PC spec requirements without much of an idea for target performance.


Speaking to Eurogamer at a recent preview event, executive prodcer Saul Gascon and creative director Cezar Virtosu gave us some more detail, and confirmed console versions will have a quality and performance mode to choose between.


&quot;What is important for us is that whenever we put [out] minimum specs, like [Nvidia] 10 series, basically, the game runs well and looks good,&quot; Gascon said. &quot;So we play of course with that, we do 720p and then upscale.&quot;

The bug in question only affected a fraction of players, but this small number included Eurogamer&#x27;s own reviewer - something which has impacted our efforts to get a Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 review to you.



So why did the bug happen? It turns out there was simply too much to do in the game for player save files to cope.

Dan Ackerman, a writer and video game journalist, published The Tetris Effect: The Game that Hypnotised the World back in 2016. In it, he describes the Cold War-era battle to get Tetris made.


This year&#x27;s Tetris film, starring Taron Egerton, retells the same story - which is of course based closely on real-life events. Still, Ackerman has now launched legal proceedings over the movie being &quot;similar in almost all material aspects&quot;.

The Pokémon Company releases plush toys of most Pokémon species, though the product photos for Wiglett&#x27;s design have caught the eye of fans, and are being rapidly shared around social media.

This is, of course, the more recently-reborn version of Telltale which sprung back to life at the end of 2018 under new management, after the original Telltale went under.


Flavourworks, meanwhile, remains best known as the developer of Erica, which first launched for PlayStation 4 back in 2019. In the years since it has refocused around mobile, and released the similarly movie-like Hush - Crane, based around the company&#x27;s smart TouchVideo tech.

                              <span>An update for Halo Infinite has been released including a new map, bug fixes, and switching off Personal AI chatter.


Your Personal AI is there in multiplayer, chatting away with some helpful (and unhelpful) quips. If that&#x27;s too much for you, it can now be disabled in the audio settings.


The update also brings a new map, Dredge, available in custom games and matchmaking playlists.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 10 years since acclaimed &quot;dystopian document thriller&quot; Papers, Please first released, and to celebrate that milestone, developer Lucas Pope has released an official Game &amp; Watch inspired demake, as well as discounting the original by 80% on all platforms.


Papers, Please made its debut on 8th August 2013, casting players as an immigration officer on the border of fictional Eastern Bloc country, Arstotzka. On the face of it, the task it sets is simple, requiring players - via a gloriously tactile interface - to crosscheck paperwork with the information provided by each visitor in order to decide whether to approve or deny their entry.


As time goes on, though, complications arise, and as individual stories begin to unfold, a challenging sense of morality weighs on proceedings. You&#x27;ve a family to support at home and a pitiful salary in which to do so; bribes are offered; threats of terrorism loom, and what seem like simple decisions can mean the difference between life and death.

                              <span>As part of its 20th anniversary celebrations, Obsidian Entertainment has been airing a documentary series digging into the studio&#x27;s history, and the newly aired final episode has a little to say about its future too, sharing a few details on the upcoming Avowed, including the revelation it started life as a co-op experience before pivoting to a single-player RPG.


&quot;When I look back at 20 years, there&#x27;s decisions of mine that I feel really good about, there&#x27;s decisions that I feel not so good about&quot;, studio head Feargus Urquhart admits at one point in the documentary. &quot;One of the things where I really pushed was that Avowed was going to be multiplayer, and I kept on that for a long time.&quot;


Urquhart says his insistence on multiplayer came from the belief it would make Avowed more interesting to publishers. At the time, the studio was independent - its since been acquired by Microsoft - and Urquhart reasoned, &quot;When you&#x27;re asking for 50, 60, 70, 80 million, you&#x27;ve got to have something interesting to talk about and multiplayer made it interesting.&quot;

                              <span>Following the official unveiling of Modern Warfare 3 earlier this week, Activision has confirmed players will be able to transfer a &quot;vast amount&quot; of previously acquired Modern Warfare 2 content over to this year&#x27;s sequel when it launches in November.


Activision shared the news in a blog on the Call of Duty website, explaining that transferable content will include the likes of &quot;weapons and cosmetic content, including Bundles, Operators, and other rewards&quot; previously unlocked by players or currently available in Modern Warfare 2. 


While most previously accrued Modern Warfare 2 content will be available in Modern Warfare 3, there are some exceptions, primarily where gameplay differences exist between the two games. &quot;For example, if MW3 doesn&#x27;t have the Tactical Amphibious Vehicle, or a specific piece of Tactical or Lethal Equipment in any game modes,&quot; Activision explains, &quot;any Skins you’ve unlocked for these items in MW2 won&#x27;t be in MW3.&quot; Wartracks music will also not transfer.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 developer Larian has said it has taken &quot;immediate&quot; steps to ensure localisation staff currently left out of the game&#x27;s credits are listed in full via a future patch.


Earlier today, a post on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted the fact that the game&#x27;s credits currently only list a fraction of the localisation team who worked on the game&#x27;s mammoth script for more than three years.


Now, in a statement to Eurogamer, Larian has said the issue lay with the list of staff it was given by localisation firm Altagram - and that it has now demanded a full list of staff for inclusion in an immediate update.

                              <span>Sony has announced the next round of games joining its PlayStation Plus subscription service this month.


The additions include two games that will be joining day one: Sea of Stars and Moving Out 2. Of course, Sony&#x27;s first party games still won&#x27;t join the service at launch but these two follow Stray and Tchia as day one third-party releases.


Sea of Stars (29th August) is developer Sabotage&#x27;s take on a classic RPG, while Moving Out 2 (15th August) is a wild furniture-packing game ideal for multiplayer - this sequel introduces online co-op with cross-play enabled.

                              <span>Flashback 2, the sequel to Delphine Software&#x27;s classic 16-bit sci-fi puzzle-platformer, now has a release date and is launching for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 16th November. And to celebrate the news, developer Microids has shared a fresh look at the game in action, this time showcasing its sprawling city of New Washington.


The original Flashback, for those unfamiliar, launched in 1992, charting the 22nd century adventures of agent Conrad B. Hart on the trail of shapeshifting aliens attempting to infiltrate human society. Flashback 2 - which was previously only confirmed for a slightly more vague &quot;November&quot; release before today&#x27;s announcement - sees the return of Conrad B. Hart as he once again goes in search of his friend Ian.


Flashback 2&#x27;s most obvious departure from its predecessor is its shift to new-fangled 3D characters and environments - the first game utilised striking rotoscoped animation for its staunchly side-scrolling action - which in turn has allowed Microids to introduce greater freedom of movement, with Hart now able to move not only left and right but forward and back.

                              <span>Take-Two, the publisher behind the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6, is once again telling investors to expect something very big to arrive next year.


This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve seen Take-Two effectively pencil in the launch of GTA6 for the coming financial year - which runs from April 2024 to March 2025. But it is, again, a clear sign that Rockstar&#x27;s still under-wraps behemoth is actually not that far off.


Speaking last night in an investor call, Take-Two&#x27;s chief financial officer Lainie Goldstein spoke of a &quot;significant inflection point&quot; and &quot;record levels of operating performance&quot; on the horizon - which is all corporate speak for  giant wads of cash.

                              <span>Nintendo has patented Link&#x27;s Ultrahand and Fuse abilities from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


The company has recently made a number of its registered patents public, including 31 related to the latest Zelda game, Automaton reports.


Many of those patents relate to Link&#x27;s main suite of abilities, but there are some more general and unusual patents too - including the game&#x27;s loading screen, for instance.

That figure is accurate to the end of June this year, and includes 3.3m consoles shifted between April and June - a figure that&#x27;s up by almost 1m on the same period in 2022.


Revenue from PlayStation&#x27;s Network Services - essentially, PlayStation Plus subscriptions - is also up. Sony raked in roughly £685k over the past three months, the most of any quarter in the past year.

Following yesterday&#x27;s announcement that Pokémon TCG and Pokémon Stadium 2 have been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library, an update was rolled out to the N64 app - something which prompted dataminers to take a look at what had been changed.

This is when the differences in Goldeneye 007 were noticed, though dataminer LuigiBlood has also suggested they could have been made during an earlier update to the N64 emulator.

Earlier this week Capcom announced the crossover - including costumes, stickers, poses and more - which has since gone live, but did not mention the pricing at the time of reporting.


The items are bought with Fighter Coins, premium in-game currency, that is purchased on the store for real money (though it can also be earned by playing).

                              <span>Reactions to Rockstar&#x27;s recently announced PS4 and Switch port of open-world cowboy classic Red Dead Redemption have been mixed to say the least, with its £40/$50 USD price point coming in for particular criticism. However, Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, has now insisted that price is &quot;commercially accurate&quot;.


Those unhappy with the Red Dead Redemption port&#x27;s price tag have noted this re-release is missing the multiplayer mode included in the original now-13-year-old game, and fails to take advantage of the modern technology it&#x27;s running on. It doesn&#x27;t help, either, that the Xbox 360 version, which is playable on Xbox One and Series X/S via backward compatibility, can currently be purchased digitally for £30.


Speaking to IGN, however, Take-Two CEO Zelnick has brushed off complaints, insisting, &quot;That&#x27;s just what we believe is the commercially accurate price for it&quot;. He also noted the inclusion of Undead Nightmare in the Switch and PS4 port, calling the zombie-themed DLC a &quot;great standalone game in its own right when it was originally released, so we feel like it&#x27;s a great bundle for the first time, and certainly a great value for consumers.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eyeing up a Steam Deck but couldn&#x27;t quite stretch to the full asking price, you might be interested to hear Valve has just launched its Certified Refurbished programme, offering up to 20% off refurbished models of its handheld gaming PC.


&quot;Each Certified Refurbished Steam Deck has been thoroughly tested to the same high standards as our retail units,&quot; Valve&#x27;s explains over on its newly launched store page. &quot;Every device goes through a complete factory reset, software update, and an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve&#x27;s facilities.&quot;


Refurbished units come with a one year warranty, a refurbished power supply, and a carrying case, and while Valve notes some might sport &quot;minor cosmetic blemishes&quot; - specifically, small blemishes or scratches on the plastic casing rather than screen - it says all units &quot;provide a reliable, high-quality gaming experience at a lower cost&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been furiously refreshing your storefront of choice ready for WrestleQuest&#x27;s arrival today, you might want to calm your finger; developer Mega Cat Studios has announced a very-last-minute delay, pushing the exuberant wrestling RPG&#x27;s launch back to 22nd August.


WrestleQuest, which Mega Cat describes as a collision between pro wrestling and RPG fantasy, was originally due to launch for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC today, 8th August. However, the studio has now opted to postpone its release for a couple of weeks after discovering a save-deleting bug during last-minute testing.


&quot;When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms,&quot; the developer explained in a recently shared tweet, &quot;we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices.&quot;

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s official reveal of Dead by Daylight&#x27;s Alien collaboration, developer Behaviour Interactive has shared further details, including an August release date and the entirely unsurprising confirmation that Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s iconic action hero Ellen Ripley will feature as a Survivor, battling against a Xenomorph killer.


The Xenomorph, described as the &quot;embodiment of the stealth Killer&quot;, comes with a new power called Runner Mode, enabling it to walk on all four legs, reducing its Terror Radius considerably. It&#x27;ll also be the first Killer to get its own exclusive sub-level, in this case a series of tunnels only accessible via seven Control Stations dotted around the collaboration&#x27;s new map.


Control Stations also house the new Survivor-only Remote Flame Turrets, which can stagger the Xenomorph when successfully deployed, causing its unique Power to end. Survivors will need to be careful, however; the turret can overheat, necessitating a repair, and the Xenomorph can destroy it if it isn&#x27;t adequately protected.

“A Practical Deep Learning-Based Acoustic Side Channel Attack on Keyboards”
Abstract: With recent developments in deep learning, the ubiquity of microphones and the rise in online services via personal devices, acoustic side channel attacks present a greater threat to keyboards than ever. This paper presents a practical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning model in order to classify laptop keystrokes, using a smartphone integrated microphone. When trained on keystrokes recorded by a nearby phone, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%, the highest accuracy seen without the use of a language model. When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video-conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium. Our results prove the practicality of these side channel attacks via off-the-shelf equipment and algorithms. We discuss a series of mitigation methods to protect users against these series of attacks...</span>

                              <span>If you - and your other 800,000 chums - have successfully managed to drag yourself away from the stupendously entertaining Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 to read this, congratulations! You&#x27;ll be thrilled to learn your penis is finally safe from prying eye thanks to developer Larian&#x27;s second major hotfix release, which, along with winging its wangs away, comes with 300+ other fixes.


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s wang clipping issue does, admittedly, appear to be something of an edge case, only affecting penises C and D, and only for characters wearing certain githyanki clothing. Even so, penises should now be safely tucked away after today&#x27;s update, doubly so given Larian says hotfix #2 also restores underpants that had unfortunately gone astray, unintentionally vacating the nether regions of male gnome sorcerers. 


The vast majority of other fixes included in today&#x27;s update are perhaps not quite so exciting - although the removal of the game&#x27;s version number from beneath the minimap is certainly welcome, as is the addition of more multiplayer servers and server scaling support.

In March, EA announced that Battlefield 1943, Battlefield: Bad Company, and Battlefield: Bad Company 2 were all set to be delisted in April ahead of the &quot;retirement of the online services for these titles&quot;, which is currently scheduled for 8th December.
EA has not made an official announcement regarding Crysis 3, Dante&#x27;s Inferno, and Dead Space 2, which will all have their servers closed come 2024.

                              <span>Microsoft has changed its popular £1/$1 monthly trial offer for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC, to now only grant access for 14 days.


The monthly trial offer was only relaunched by Microsoft in July, after it was removed back in March. At the time, Microsoft said it was &quot;evaluating different marketing promotions&quot;. 


Now, just a month later - and after a price increase for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - Xbox fans have spotted that the trial has been altered to last just 14 days - less than half the time it used to (thanks XGP).

                              <span>The Teal Mask, the first expansion for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, will launch for Nintendo Switch on 13th September.

The Pokémon Company confirmed the news today in a 35-minute Pokémon Presents broadcast, which also announced that the fan-favourite Mew and Mewtwo were also coming to Scarlet and Violet via Mystery Gift and Tera Raid Battles, respectively. (For Mew, enter the password GETY0URMEW before 18th September.)


Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s second and final expansion, The Indigo Disk, remains listed as a &quot;winter 2023&quot; launch.

                              <span>The Red Dead Redemption community has had mixed reactions to yesterday&#x27;s announcement from Rockstar Games - a port of the original Red Dead Redemption to PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
The news has some positives, in that it&#x27;ll bring the game to more platforms and make it easier to play for people who don&#x27;t have a PlayStation 3 or play on Xbox. With the game now on all modern platforms, it also guarantees access to it for at least another couple of years which is good for games preservation.
Unfortunately, that&#x27;s where praise for the re-releases ends, as Red Dead Redemption fans have taken to social channels to voice their disappointment and frustrations.

                              <span>Following the announcement of cloud game streaming in June, Sony has started to roll out a beta for the offering to PS Plus Premium subscribers.

Back in June, Sony didn&#x27;t mention when to expect the feature to release, though Sony exec Nick Maguire stated it was in the &quot;early stages&quot; of testing.

Yesterday, users on ResetEra and Reddit began to report they had received invitations to an exclusive beta for PS5 cloud streaming.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 developer Larian has explained why the rules of Dungeons and Dragons make any potential expansion to its hit PC role-player &quot;very hard&quot; to make. 


Indeed, Larian currently has no Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 expansion in the works.


Speaking to PC Gamer, Larian boss Swen Vincke said the rules of D&amp;D - which Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 follows closely - mean any continuation of the game would enter potentially tricky territory, with characters at higher levels able to wield game-breaking godlike powers.

                              <span>Devolver Digital has delayed a bunch of its games, and, Devolver being Devolver, it announced those delays in a special three-minute showcase - complete with inane Nindies-style banter - that also (presumably in the name of balance and order) featured a couple of games still on track to release this year. Want to know what landed in which pile? Then here we go.


First up on Devolver&#x27;s &#x27;now coming in 2024&#x27; list is The Plucky Squire, an eye-catching adventure from former Pokémon artist James Turner, that wonderfully blends 2D and 3D as illustrations from a living picturebook escape and begin to cause chaos in the real world.

Equally eye-catching and equally delayed is Sam Eng&#x27;s Skate Story, in which a skateboarding demon navigates an Underworld made of &quot;glass and pain&quot; in order to swallow the moon.

                              <span>Dark and Darker, the mediaeval extraction looter from Ironmace Games, has - after a turbulent few months and amid ongoing legal troubles - launched into early access, but not on Steam.


Dark and Darker, you might recall, received a hugely positive reception when it featured as part of Valve&#x27;s Steam Next Fest earlier this year. Soon after, though, Korean game publisher Nexon accused Ironmace of copyright infringement, claiming members of the development team had used &quot;materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at Nexon to create Dark and Darker - an accusation Ironmace has repeatedly denied.


Ironmace&#x27;s woes continued when a cease and desist demand from Nexon forced the game off Steam, and, despite successfully getting Dark and Darker&#x27;s recent playtests into players&#x27; hands through some creative problem solving, the game&#x27;s early access launch - which was originally planned for late April to early May this year - has seen several delayed.

That&#x27;s according to Remnant 2 director and Gunfire Games president David Adams, who shared the news during a recent AMA (Ask Me Anything) Q&amp;A session on Reddit.


&quot;Yes, we are looking at it&quot;, Adams explained when asked if crossplay was something Remnant 2 might get in the future. &quot;There are issues with the different platforms and what they require in order to allow crossplay,&quot; he continued, &quot;but it is being actively worked on&quot;.

                              <span>I just read an article complaining that NIST is taking too long in finalizing its post-quantum-computing cryptography standards.
This process has been going on since 2016, and since that time there has been a huge increase in quantum technology and an equally large increase in quantum understanding and interest. Yet seven years later, we have only four algorithms, although last week NIST announced that a number of other candidates are under consideration, a process that is expected to take “several years.
The delay in developing quantum-resistant algorithms is especially troubling given the time it will take to get those products to market. It generally takes four to six years with a new standard for a vendor to develop an ASIC to implement the standard, and it then takes time for the vendor to get the product validated, which seems to be taking a troubling amount of time...</span>

                              <span>Activision has whisked back the curtain on this year&#x27;s Call of Duty instalment, eliciting exactly zero gasps of surprise from anyone. As widely rumoured previously, it&#x27;s titled Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and it&#x27;s releasing on 10th November.


Today&#x27;s official reveal comes courtesy of a brisk teaser trailer which, alongside a whole lot of hyperactive whizzing between abstract pointy things, includes glimpses of a few familiar faces from the Call of Duty series - namely Captain Price and Vladimir Makarov - and a voice over warning, &quot;Never bury your enemies alive.&quot;


This year&#x27;s Call of Duty instalment has, of course, been rumoured to be Modern Warfare 3 for quite some time. The name first surfaced back in May, and Activision effectively confirmed it in July when the name appeared during a spate of DMCA takedowns aimed at leakers online.

                              <span>Rockstar Games has just announced that Red Dead Redemption is making its way on to newer consoles for the first time: PS4 and Switch.
Originally released in 2010 for the PS3 and Xbox 360, rumours of a remaster have been bubbling for a while, following reports of its development. Last month, a new rating for Red Dead Redemption was spotted, which kept hopes alive.
The release on PS4 and Switch isn&#x27;t a remaster unfortunately - Rockstar has called it a  &quot;conversion&quot; produced by Double Eleven Studios, which has quite a bit of experience in porting games to modern consoles.

The ride will open as part of this year&#x27;s Halloween Horror Nights at Universal, and will take plenty of inspiration from the original game, rather than HBO&#x27;s successful TV adadptation.

Speaking to SFX Magazine, Universal Studios show director Lora Sauls discussed The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann&#x27;s input into the attraction and working with Baker and Johnson.

Debate around the term recently resurfaced following comments from Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida in an interview with Skill-Up. Yoshida stated the term &quot;wasn&#x27;t a compliment to a lot of developers in Japan&quot; and was seen as &quot;discriminatory&quot;.


Kamiya, however, is more positive about the term, believing it reflects the &quot;unique sensitivity&quot; of Japanese creators in the games they make.

As announced at Evo 2023, Azucena is known as the &quot;Coffee Queen&quot; as she&#x27;s the latest heir in the Ortiz family line who&#x27;s entered The King of Iron Fist Tournament to promote their coffee plantation.


Azucena&#x27;s movement is based on Mixed Martial Arts but with some unconventional twists - she&#x27;s able to switch to the Liberador stance where she dodges attacks by instinct instead of blocking.

A.K.I. is described as a &quot;maniacal poison aficionado&quot;, and it&#x27;s easy to see why from her reveal trailer.

                              <span>Sales of Final Fantasy 16 did not meet Square Enix&#x27;s high expectations, said president Takashi Kiryu.


Last week the company&#x27;s latest earnings report was released and while net sales increased, operating profit dropped 79 percent from ¥14.4bn to just ¥3.0bn.


During a post-earnings call to analysts, Kiryu said the high end of the company&#x27;s expectations were not met and the slow adoption of the PlayStation 5 was a limiting factor, Bloomberg reports.

                              <span>Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra has confirmed that the team hopes to have &quot;fixed&quot; the bug that&#x27;s preventing some Diablo 4 players from progressing and collecting their rewards in the new season by 15th August.

After tweeting his progress thus far, confirming that he had fully completed Season 1, Ybarra received a reply from a Diablo 4 fan who said: &quot;Unfortunately some of us cannot do this due [to] a bug&quot;.

The issue sees players stuck at Slayer level because the game won&#x27;t accept that they&#x27;ve completed the A Boon in the Tide quest no matter how many times they attempt to open the Tortured Gift Helltide chest.

                              <span>A bunch of networks, including US Government networks, have been hacked by the Chinese. The hackers used forged authentication tokens to access user email, using a stolen Microsoft Azure account consumer signing key. Congress wants answers. The phrase “negligent security practices” is being tossed about—and with good reason. Master signing keys are not supposed to be left around, waiting to be stolen.
Actually, two things went badly wrong here. The first is that Azure accepted an expired signing key, implying a vulnerability in whatever is supposed to check key validity. The second is that this key was supposed to remain in the the system’s Hardware Security Module—and not be in software. This implies a really serious breach of good security practice. The fact that Microsoft has not been forthcoming about the details of what happened tell me that the details are really bad...</span>

As spotted by our friends over at Dicebreaker, the alleged theft occurred at the Indiana Convention Center on Wednesday 2nd August, the day before the show opened. According to police reports, the suspects acquired the cards whilst exhibitors were setting up for the event.

&quot;[Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department] detectives are seeking the public’s help in identifying two people of interest possibly involved in a theft of upwards to $300,000 worth of gaming cards,&quot; the IMPD tweeted earlier this week, including images of the suspects making off with a full pallet of Magic: The Gathering cards.

According to SteamDB, as of this morning (Sunday 6th August) Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has broken into Steam&#x27;s top ten most played games. It has amassed a staggering 712,281 concurrent players, becoming Steam&#x27;s ninth biggest game ever in terms of concurrent player counts.

That means Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has now eclipsed the concurrent Steam player peaks for games like Valheim, Goose Goose Duck, and Respawn&#x27;s Apex Legends.

                              <span>Destiny 2 developer Bungie has revealed plans to shake up how players progress in its upcoming expansion, The Final Shape.

In a &quot;State of the Game&quot; update posted to the official website, game director Joe Blackburn confirmed that as well as addressing &quot;a number of player feedback items over the past few months&quot;, the team would be &quot;rolling out something very new and different in Season 23&quot;. 

&quot;While there&#x27;s always room for us to revise and improve, the community&#x27;s response has reinforced that we&#x27;re on the right track with norm-breaking efforts like these, and we&#x27;ll be rolling out something very new and different in Season 23,&quot; Blackburn said (thanks, NME).

                              <span>Bandai Namco Europe has seemingly let slip about two more characters coming to Tekken 8&#x27;s roster.

Yesterday, the official EU website was seemingly updated to add two news stories to its Tekken 8 mini-site revealing the new additions. Shortly thereafter they were taken down again, but not before eagle-eyed players were able to grab a screenshot. 

Yes, this could be an elaborate hoax – there&#x27;s no way to be sure, as the Wayback Machine hasn&#x27;t indexed the site since the end of July – but if true, it does add credence to the incomplete roster that leaked shortly after the closed network test as the new additions see the welcome return of Raven and usher in newcomer Azucena.

That&#x27;s according to players on the game&#x27;s subreddit, who report that players tempted to disconnect and transfer non-seasonal items to a seasonal character are finding out the hard way that Blizzard has a zero-tolerance policy for the exploit.

&quot;My friend got banned today,&quot; wrote u/SaintCharlie in a thread entitled &quot;PSA - Blizzard IS INDEED banning people for the seasonal exploit bug&quot;.

                              <span>Last week, players using Cheat Engine in Tekken 8&#x27;s network test leaked part of Tekken 8&#x27;s roster. And this week, Bandai Namco is banning people from making videos about it.

Right now, it&#x27;s unclear if Bandai Namco is issuing strikes to suppress inaccurate data or because the details are correct, but whatever the reason, the publisher is seemingly issuing copyright strikes against YouTubers discussing the leaked roster.

Tekken 8&#x27;s now closed network test allowed players to sample five stages and 16 playable characters, including Asuka Kazama, Bryan Fury, Claudio Serafino, Hwoarang, Jin Kazama, Jun Kazama, Leroy Smith, Nina Williams, and Paul Phoenix, amongst others.

                              <span>Gran Turismo movie star David Harbour has revealed that by filming &quot;real&quot; racing sequences rather than relying on &quot;green screen boxes&quot; in the upcoming movie has enhanced his performance.

Talking to Sky News, Harbour – who plays Jack Salter in the movie – said that whilst it may be tempting and &quot;cynical&quot; to believe that most viewers wouldn&#x27;t know the difference between CGI and real racing scenes, by having real cars racing at 150mph, it &quot;heightened his performance because the stakes are real&quot;.

&quot;This movie could&#x27;ve shot in green screen boxes – we could have done all this stuff – but there was something about putting together this team of people who are able to organise all these cars going at the same moment, stopping at the same moment, warming up the tires, all the technical elements,&quot; Harbour said, as transcribed by Eurogamer. &quot;It feels like, as an actor, you&#x27;re part of this big production.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is already off to a spectacular start, having now sailed passed the half a million concurrent players mark on Steam after a huge first day, but developer Larian isn&#x27;t resting on its laurians; the studio has just released its first hotfix for the wildly ambitious RPG which, among other things, takes aim at that nasty save-preventing bug.


Larian acknowledged the save issue and offered some preliminary solutions earlier today, but its first hot fix update aims to tackle things head on. As the developer explains in its accompanying patch notes, after some investigation, it&#x27;s now found that cross-saves are to blame.


&quot;Bearing in mind this will only be a useful feature come 6th September when the PlayStation 5 version launches (and beyond),&quot; Larian explains, &quot;we&#x27;ve decided to disable it for now to allow us to solve the issue in the interim. You shouldn&#x27;t notice anything in-game and Steam Cloud saves are unaffected by this change.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Gunfire Games&#x27; procedurally generated fantasy shooter Remnant 2 has been a hit, garnering positive reviews and selling over 1m copies in the space of the week. And amid all that excitement (not to mention some cheeky sneakery) Gunfire has been preparing its first major patch for Remnant 2, targeting performance, stability, and various quality of life improvements. It&#x27;s out now on PC and the developer says a console release should follow &quot;very soon&quot;, once the update has cleared Sony and Microsoft&#x27;s approval process. 


Introducing Remnant 2&#x27;s new update on its website, Gunfire explains, &quot;We&#x27;ve made our initial pass on stability, and performance on all platforms, focused on progression blockers, bugs, and addressed some Quality of Life requests from the community.&quot;


As per Gunfire&#x27;s Remnant 2 patch notes, today&#x27;s update features &quot;initial optimisations to improve overall performance&quot;, as well as updates to improve hitching and potential crashes, plus fixes to various reported crash bugs. The developer also notes it&#x27;s now moved high detail shadows to a separate option on PC, which can be activated if required.

                              <span>Acclaimed martial arts adventure Sifu is nearing the end of its journey; developer Sloclap has announced the game will be getting its last-ever content update on 7th September.


Sifu has, of course, been around for a while at this point, having launched for PS5 and PC via the Epic Games Store back in February last year. It made the jump to Xbox and Steam this March, bringing its acclaimed third-person, single-player action -  which Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called an &quot;elegant martial arts meditation on temporality and self-possession&quot; in his Recommended review last year - to a whole new audience.


Throughout that time developer Sloclap has steadily expanded and improved on the original experience - which charts a young Kung Fu student&#x27;s vaguely magical quest for revenge following the murder of his family - releasing a wealth of free content updates, most recently in the form of its Arenas expansion, which added around 10-hours of fresh gameplay nine new locations and &quot;45 merciless challenges spread over five game modes&quot;.

This makes Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 the second-largest Steam launch of 2023 so far in terms of player count, with just Hogwarts Legacy in front.


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is currently the third-most played game of the last 24 hours, behind only Steam stalwarts Counter-Strike and Dota 2.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re not one of the many PC players already Baldur&#x27;s deep in a certain RPG spectacular and you&#x27;re looking for some amusement this weekend, the Epic Games Store has unveiled a fresh batch of freebies to download and keep, which this week take the form of developer Four Quarters&#x27; RPG oddity Loop Hero and Ninja Kiwi&#x27;s vibrant tower defence adventure Bloons TD 6.


Starting with Loop Hero, it&#x27;s a fantasy RPG with a twist; the twist being your heroes are stuck automatically navigating the procedurally generated world, battling monsters, and so on, in an endless, literal loop. You don&#x27;t have a whole lot of control over what they do, but as they down enemies you accumulate loot to boost their stats and - more importantly - collect cards to place in the world that introduce new encounters and perhaps new bonuses to be exploited on successive loops. Reach a certain point and you fight a boss, then on it goes.


That&#x27;s the very basics of it, at least, and Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan quite liked its peculiar, grindy progression when he reviewed it back in 2021, slapping it with ye olde Recommended badge, and calling it a &quot;deeply knowing game whose designers pluck at your obsessions as if they&#x27;re idly reaching into a piano case to twang the strings&quot;.

                              <span>Following a bit of a ratings board leak earlier this year, a new report has claimed a Quake 2 remaster will - in a move that wouldn&#x27;t exactly be surprising - be getting an official unveiling during this year&#x27;s QuakeCon festivities, which take place next week.


A Quake 2 remaster first reared in head in June this year, when a listing appeared on the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea&#x27;s website. And now, reliable leaker billbil-kun has piped up (thanks VGC) with some fresh information, claiming both an imminent QuakeCon unveiling and a release for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch.


As astute readers may have already spotted, those are the very same platforms that received a Nightdive-Studios-developed 25th anniversary remaster of the original Quake back in 2021. Billbil-kun says the remaster of its sequel will simply be referred to as Quake 2, ditching the &#x27;Remastered&#x27; suffix that appeared in the South Korean ratings board listing.

                              <span>Eyes might currently be on THQ Nordic&#x27;s remake of cult-classic action-RPG Gothic, but the company has unexpectedly announced it&#x27;ll be bringing the two-decade-old original version to Switch on 28th September, with a huge number of fixes.


The original Gothic, which was created by developer Piranha Bytes and released in 2001, follows the story of a convicted prisoner who finds himself on a quest across a dangerous medieval fantasy realm. Its mix of action-orientated open-world exploration and RPG-style customisation has garnered something of a cult following over the years, leading THQ Nordic to start canvassing interest in a remake back in 2019.


It&#x27;s the 2001 release that&#x27;s coming to Switch, however, with THQ Nordic promising &quot;great performance and a well adapted user interface and controls&quot; across the 50+ hour adventure. And while the company is clear the Switch port is &quot;the original game code, no remastering, and no remaking&quot;, it also shared an absolutely enormous list of fixes it&#x27;s made for the release.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 developer Larian has spoken a little about acquisitions following recent reports the studio had, at one time, been on Microsoft&#x27;s consideration list for a potential buy-out, saying it has no plans to sell to anyone anytime soon.


Microsoft&#x27;s watchlist for potential studio acquisitions first surfaced back in June during its court battle with US antitrust agency the Federal Trade Commision over its planned Activision Blizzard deal, with the likes of Sega, Bungie, CD Projekt Red, No Man&#x27;s Sky studio Hello Games, Hitman developer IO Interactive, Pokémon Go creator Niantic, and Hades studio Supergiant Games all appearing on its 2021 &quot;consideration set&quot;.


Also on there was Larian Studios - which has made the acclaimed likes of Divinity: Original Sin prior to today&#x27;s eagerly awaited Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - and, now, founder and CEO Swen Vincke has shared more of his thoughts on such acquisitions in an interview with Bloomberg.

                              <span>ChatGPT was released just nine months ago, and we are still learning how it will affect our daily lives, our careers, and even our systems of self-governance.
But when it comes to how AI may threaten our democracy, much of the public conversation lacks imagination. People talk about the danger of campaigns that attack opponents with fake images (or fake audio or video) because we already have decades of experience dealing with doctored images. We’re on the lookout for foreign governments that spread misinformation because we were traumatized by the 2016 US presidential election. And we worry that AI-generated opinions will swamp the political preferences of real people because we’ve seen political “astroturfing”—the use of fake online accounts to give the illusion of support for a policy—grow for decades...</span>

                              <span>Apex Legends: Resurrection, the 18th season of the popular battle royale, will land on Tuesday 8th August. The biggest change coming to the game is the total re-work of the Synthetic Nightmare Revenant. Also, Broken Moon is being added to Mix Tape, the Charge Rifle gets some changes, and early Apex fans may be pleased to hear that Season 2&#x27;s Disruptor Rounds are coming back!
First thing&#x27;s first, let&#x27;s get the big one out of the way - the revamp of Revenant. If you&#x27;ve been playing this deadly Legend throughout season 17 you may have noticed that he&#x27;s beginning to act strangely, glitching and other out-of-character actions starting to come through. This is the start of the revamp of Apex&#x27;s Synthetic Nightmare.
It&#x27;s not a secret that the popularity of Revenant has dropped off in past seasons with their previous abilities not really keeping up with the fast paced combat laid out by the newer Legends.

                              <span>Treasure&#x27;s classic shoot-em-up Radiant Silvergun is coming soon to Steam, the first time it&#x27;s been available on PC.



Originally released in 1998 on the Sega Saturn and in arcades in Japan, it was later released on the Xbox 360 in 2011 and last year the Nintendo Switch with local co-op play and online leaderboards, as well as updated graphics.


Judging by the trailer on Steam (the same as the below Switch trailer), it&#x27;s this version that will soon be released - though the exact release date is unknown.

                              <span>Nintendo has had a record quarter, largely thanks to Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom which has sold 18.51m units as of 30th June.  


That is more than half of Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sales thus far, with the Tears of the Kingdom predecessor now sitting at 30.65m copies sold.


Nintendo shared these latest figures as part of its Quarterly Results. Here, the company stated its most recent Zelda release constituted &quot;approximately half&quot; of the first party software sold this fiscal year.

                              <span>The next patch for Diablo 4 will arrive next week and bring buffs for the vilified Sorcerer and Barbarian classes.


In last week&#x27;s fireside chat with the developers, Blizzard promised improved &quot;effectiveness and fun&quot; for these two classes - now we know exactly how in the latest patch notes for 1.1.1.



For Sorcerers, the intention was to improve late-game survivability and move away from &quot;kiss-curse&quot; effects where players gain power but lose it elsewhere. For Barbarians, the flow of combat will be sped up by increasing Fury generation and the power of Unique items in the late-game.

                              <span>Striking Distance Studios, the developer behind last year&#x27;s sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol, has laid off 32 employees amid efforts to &quot;realign the studio&#x27;s priorities&quot;.


In a statement provided to IGN, the developer wrote, &quot;Striking Distance Studios and [publisher] Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio&#x27;s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honouring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.&quot;


As reported by VGC, a number of affected employees began publically discussing the layoffs on social media prior to Striking Distance&#x27;s official announcement. These included associate level designer Thomas Catalano, VFX artist Matt Christopherson, associate producer Nora Falcon, level design assistant Justin Fields, production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, and senior environment artist Matthew Smith.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to April 2020, and you might recall the wholly unexpected announcement that infamous 80s jungle horror Cannibal Holocaust would be getting a video game sequel. The project&#x27;s seen a tumultuous few years - and several changes in direction - since then, but its developer has now shed a little more light on its behind-the-scenes struggles, and provided an update on the form it&#x27;ll take when it eventually arrives next year.


Cannibal, as the project was initially known back in 2020, was announced as a collobaration between Italian developer Fantastico Studio and Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato. Based on one of Deodato&#x27;s unpublished screenplays, it&#x27;s technically the fourth sequel to Cannibal Holocaust - a movie that gained notoriety on its original release for its graphic violence, depictions of sexual assault, and actual animal cruelty, making it something of an unlikely candidate for the video game treatment.


In a new interview with PC Gamer, Fantastico&#x27;s creative director Andrea Valesini explains its original concept for the game was to adapt Deodato&#x27;s screenplay into a format resembling a visual novel. As per its initial announcement, the project was due to release by the end of 2020, but after an unexpectedly positive response to Cannibal&#x27;s reveal, the studio decided &quot;it definitely made sense to invest more money into the game&quot; and opted to tackle the screenplay in a more ambitious form, turning it into something closer to an point-and-click adventure.

                              <span>Microsoft is currently rolling out a new &quot;highly requested&quot; feature for select Xbox Insiders that&#x27;ll let them stream their console gameplay directly to Discord, with the capability said to be launching for all Xbox One and Series X/S users &quot;soon&quot;.


Judging by Microsoft&#x27;s post announcing the new feature, getting things working is a pretty straightforward process, piggybacking off the streamlined Discord chat functionality - which replaced the previous mobile device faff - introduced to Xbox last October.


All users need do in order to stream to Discord is press the Xbox button on their controller to access the guide, head to &#x27;Parties &amp; chats&#x27;, then select &#x27;Discord&#x27; from there.

                              <span>If you ask Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant AI system, whether Amazon is a monopoly, it responds by saying it doesn’t know. It doesn’t take much to make it lambaste the other tech giants, but it’s silent about its own corporate parent’s misdeeds.
When Alexa responds in this way, it’s obvious that it is putting its developer’s interests ahead of yours. Usually, though, it’s not so obvious whom an AI system is serving. To avoid being exploited by these systems, people will need to learn to approach AI skeptically. That means deliberately constructing the input you give it and thinking critically about its output...</span>

                              <span>What the Golf - developer Triband&#x27;s extremely daft, but wonderfully entertaining golfing oddity - is gearing up for a busy few months. First up, its free Among Us collaboration is making the jump from Apple Arcade to PC and Switch tomorrow, 3rd August, then the game will be making its  PlayStation debut &quot;soon&quot;, with more free content to follow.


What the Golf, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, serves up a succession of dependably ludicrous golf-flavoured mini-games, all loosely themed around the notion of hitting things with club. The basic rules are re-jigged and re-written to increasingly improbably degrees with each new level - one stage might see your golf ball turned into an awkwardly rotating office chair, another might send you into space - and the end results is a ceaselessly surprising joy (even if you&#x27;re not much of a golf fan), that was one of our favourite games of 2019.


Since its original Apple Arcade release, What the Golf has jumped to PC and Switch, receiving various bits of free post-launch content along the way. One of those updates, the aforementioned Among Us collaboration, arrived this April as an Apple Arcade exclusive, but it new overworld and 35+ new levels come to Switch and PC tomorrow, 3rd August.

                              <span>Tomek Baginski, executive producer on Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher, has blamed American audiences and social media sites such as TikTok for the series&#x27; simplified take on the books&#x27; plots.


Speaking to Polish outlet Wyborcza (and translated by Redanian Intelligence), Baginski tried to explain why the TV series had changed plot elements from Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s novels. 


The producer explained a lot happens behind the scenes, such as scripts needing to be rewritten due to a cast member falling ill. &quot;There are a lot of understandable reasons why controversial decisions are made, but the viewer does not have this context, so sometimes it hurts because something was better in the book,&quot; Baginski reasoned.

Step up, Merlin the dog - who is coming to Modern Warzone 2 and Warzone 2.0 as part of the new Season 05: Blackcell.


In battle, Merlin - and other &quot;tactical pets&quot; which are yet to be unveiled - will stay strapped to your person, a bit like a gun holstered at your hip. But Merlin and his friends aren&#x27;t just for show! You can also select your animal friend to carry out a &quot;devastating&quot; finishing move.

                              <span>Popular crowdfunding platform Kickstarter has announced a new policy on AI.

The policy will go into effect on 29th August, and has been created from discussions with creators, backers, and &quot;other platform leaders&quot;, Kickstarter said.

When submitting a project, creators will be asked to state whether AI is used and how. Creators will also need to confirm they have consent to use any works or data being fed into the AI. Submissions will be put through a &quot;human review process&quot; to ensure the use of AI has been properly disclosed.

                              <span>Nintendo has apologised for leaving Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon on Wii U without online play since March, as it brings servers for both games back online.


In a statement released today, five months after it temporarily shut down online multiplayer for both titles, Nintendo says it has addressed a &quot;vulnerability related to online play&quot;. 


Servers will go live again sometime tomorrow, 3rd August, some 153 days later, with a fresh patch to download for both Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon.

                              <span>Remnant 2 is doing alright for itself; not only has the Souls-esque procedural shooter secured some extremely positive reviews, it&#x27;s also selling well too; and amid all the general positivity around its release, there&#x27;s a bit more fun news courtesy of a whole new secret class that developer Gunfire Games squirrelled away for dataminers to find.


The class (or Archetype, as Remnant 2 would have it) in question is known as the Archon, and requires players to go through an extremely convoluted set of steps to unlock, ranging from activating skills on specific Archetypes at certain levels to equipping a whole lot of gear before hefting the everything over to a very particular place.


The requirements, then, are not the kind of thing anyone is really ever likely to stumble across by accident, with Gunfire Games instead having designed the Archon class to be something that could only realistically be uncovered by dataminers.

                              <span>Developer Volition&#x27;s beleaguered Saints Row reboot has almost reached the end of its journey - as far as the studio has currently revealed, at least - with the game&#x27;s third and final bit of DLC, titled A Song Of Ice And Dust, now confirmed to arrive next Tuesday, 8th August, ahead of a Steam release for what was previously an Epic Games Store PC exclusive on 24th August.


Specifics surrounding A Song Of Ice And Dust are still a little thin on the ground, but a brief synopsis accompanying today&#x27;s release date news sets the scene for the DLC thusly: &quot;When a crippling ambush decimates the Dustlanders, it&#x27;s up to fierce rivals Bossonius and Gwendolyn Firebird to join forces and defend The DustFaire from a new foe.&quot;


As previously revealed when Volition shared its post-launch development roadmap for Saints Row earlier this year, the reboot&#x27;s third and final paid DLC expansion will introduce new story missions, new enemies, new cosmetics, and more.

                              <span>After what feels like far too long an absence, it&#x27;s all go-go-go in the world of Samba de Amigo. Not only is Sega&#x27;s beloved rhythm-action series getting outings on Switch and Meta Quest soon, it&#x27;ll be launching onto mobile via Apple Arcade this month.


More specifically, Apple&#x27;s gaming subscription service is getting a version of the maraca-shaking classic called Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go, which arrives on 29th August - the same day Samba de Amigo: Party Central launches on Switch.


Party-To-Go will feature 40 songs when it arrives in August, with more to follow after launch. There&#x27;s no complete track list to peruse yet, but Sega&#x27;s official announcement says it&#x27;ll feature three songs exclusive to the Apple Arcade game: Daddy (feat. CL) by Psy, Lady Gaga&#x27;s The Edge of Glory, and The Walker from Fitz and the Tantrums.

                              <span>Just a month after shooting itself into space for the first time, asymmetrical multiplayer horror game Dead by Daylight is doing it all over again, only this time with an official license for the quintessential space scare-&#x27;em-up, Alien.


That&#x27;s Alien singular, of course, Ridley Scott&#x27;s seminal 1979 space horror in which Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s iconic action hero Ellen Ripley, along with her crewmates aboard the spaceship Nostromo, are terrorised by an even more iconic phallus-headed extraterrestrial predator known as a Xenomorph. Someone also gets a tummy ache; it&#x27;s great.


That single, deadly foe (as opposed to the umpteen creatures present in James Cameron&#x27;s action-heavy 1986 follow-up, Aliens) makes Alien the perfect fit for Dead by Daylight&#x27;s four-survivors-versus-one-killer set-up. As of right now, however, developer Behaviour Interactive is remaining coy about which of the movie&#x27;s characters we might get to play as.

                              <span>The US Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules around the disclosure of cybersecurity incidents. There are two basic rules:
Public companies must “disclose any cybersecurity incident they determine to be material” within four days, with potential delays if there is a national security risk.
Public companies must “describe their processes, if any, for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats” in their annual filings.
The rules go into effect this December.

This advice comes direct from developer Larian, which said that doing all of the above would &quot;reduce the risk of file conflicts when the final game downloads&quot;, meaning &quot;more playing, and no troubleshooting!&quot;

Players who do have mods installed are also advised to ensure they do not automatically re-download.

                              <span>Rayman&#x27;s long-awaited return mightn&#x27;t be quite what fans were hoping for - arriving as he is in a bit of DLC for the excellent Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope instead of his own game - but something&#x27;s (hopefully) better than nothing, and Ubisoft has now confirmed its beloved limb-flinging mascot will be making his entrance on 30th August this year.


Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope: Rayman in the Phantom Show is described as a brand-new DLC adventure that&#x27;ll be separate from the base game&#x27;s storyline. Here, Rabbid Mario and Rabbid Peach stumble across the Space Opera Network, an &quot;uncanny&quot; TV studio run by the Phantom, one of the antagonists in Ubsoft&#x27;s previous Mario + Rabbids game, Kingdom Battle.


&quot;As the TV studio&#x27;s rating are lower than ever,&quot; Ubisoft explains in its release date announcement, &quot;he needs the help of true stars to help him get his past glory back.&quot;

Additionally, trailers for the game have been taken down, due to a copyright claim made by Sony. 


If you head to The Last Hope&#x27;s Nintendo eShop store page now, you will instead be greeted by a 404 message, and a generic image of Star Fox&#x27;s Peppy Hare (which is actually more pleasing on the eye than what was there previously).

The purple-ish pad costs £65 ($70) and launches in the UK, US and other countries next week, on Tuesday 8th August.


Unlocking the accompanying Stormcloud Vapor dynamic dashboard background is as simple as connecting your controller to the Xbox. So, presumably, you can buy one and pass it around your friends if they fancy nabbing the background for themselves.

Activision, along with its subsidiaries, was responsible for developing and publishing plenty of Transformers games over the years, including the popular Transformers: Fall of Cybertron and Transformers: Devastation.
A new game for the franchise, titled Transformers: Reactivate, is currently in development by Brink developer Splash Damage, but if you were hoping to brush up on older titles ahead of its release, you&#x27;re out of luck.

                              <span>If you thought there wasn&#x27;t anything else left to discover in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, you&#x27;d be sorely mistaken. Zelda engineers have now discovered a way to use what they&#x27;re calling &quot;quantum entanglement&quot; to connect objects together over large distances, without a visible connection between them. 

This process, which has been dubbed &quot;q-linking&quot; by the community, has a brief yet rich history - a previous q-linking method was found in an earlier version of the game but has since been patched out by Nintendo as of version 1.2.0.

Nevertheless, that hasn&#x27;t stopped Zelda players from experimenting with the game&#x27;s physics and figuring out the boundaries of what can and cannot be achieved.

                              <span>On its surface, Pikmin is a cute strategy game about growing little plant people and gathering treasure. Delve deeper into its lore, however, and you&#x27;ll find fans debating the series&#x27; apparent commentary on human extinction, and all sorts of timey-wimey shenanigans going on to make its many story elements match up. 

Spoiler warning: the following article discusses endgame details for Pikmin 4.

Before Pikmin 4, I&#x27;d never spent much time trying to make Pikmin&#x27;s setting make sense. It&#x27;s based on Earth, obviously, though a version with different animals and no humans in sight. And yet, you can still run around and find evidence of human existence - and seemingly very recent human existence at that, with freshly-baked food and other objects simply lying about. Are humans extinct, or have we all simply popped out for tea? It doesn&#x27;t really matter to the simple stories Pikmin games tell.

Tekken 8&#x27;s latest network test ran over the weekend, and provided those taking part with a taster of what&#x27;s in store. But, of course, the beta&#x27;s files were cracked, allowing some players to continue beyond the test period. 


Perhaps understandably, Bandai Namco does not want this to continue and has now issued a warning to anyone playing a cracked version - saying that anyone continuing to play breaches both the game&#x27;s terms of service and the Tekken World Tour code of conduct.

On PC, at least, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 weighs in at 122GB. It&#x27;s global launch time is 4pm UK on the 3rd August - that&#x27;s 5pm CET, 11am Eastern or 8am Pacific.


If you&#x27;ve been playing via Early Access, your saves won&#x27;t carry over - but &quot;so much has changed that it&#x27;s really worth it to start afresh&quot;, developer Larian has said.

Since launching back in 2016, American Truck Simulator&#x27;s digital reimagining of the US - with its miles of winding road and endless sweeping vistas - has been steadily expanded and refined through a mixture of free and paid updates. Oklahoma brings the game&#x27;s total number of explorable states up to 13, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas.


SCS says &quot;wonderful state parks, several natural marvels, and historical places full of mysteries and legends&quot; await those that pick up American Truck Simulator&#x27;s Oklahoma DLC, and its arrival will be accompanied by a new World of Trucks community event tasking players with communally amassing a total of 111m miles travelled while delivering cargoes - during jobs of at least 100 miles - to or from any of the 10 cities including in the expansion.

As a mere glimpse will confirm, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk pays homage and then some to Sega&#x27;s beloved Dreamcast classic Jet Set Radio, sporting an immediately familiar cell-shaded aesthetic as players skate, skateboard, and cycle through the futuristic streets of New Amsterdam, dodging militarised police, spraying graffiti, and facing off against other crews.


Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&#x27;s New Amsterdam features five main boroughs to explore, and players can make use of a &quot;unique environment based trick system&quot; that includes combos and boost tricks as they roam. Additionally, there&#x27;re new crew members to recruit along the way, plus a composer line-up including Hideki Naganuma, who wrote Jet Set Radio&#x27;s soundtrack.

                              <span>Following EA Sports FC 24&#x27;s formal unveiling earlier this month, the steady dripfeed of news continues, with EA now revealing a partnership with the Ballon D&#x27;or that&#x27;ll see the presitgious award come to Player Career mode via a glitzy in-game end-of-season ceremony - for players on current-gen consoles and PC, at least.


The Ballon d&#x27;Or has been awarded annually to the best football player of the season by French magazine France Football since 1956, and an award specfically for female players was introduced in 2018. Come the arrival of EA Sports FC this September, those that manage a particularly strong individual season in Player Career mode can earn the Ballon d&#x27;Or in-game.


That manifests as a glitzy award ceremony where the winning player steps up on stage to receive the prize amid rapturous applause from the audience. You can watch the proceedings in the latest EA Sports FC video deep dive below, which this time focuses on Career mode.

                              <span>Microsoft has submitted a material changes of circumstances document to the UK&#x27;s regulator which stands opposed to its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, urging it to drop its block of the deal. 
The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority previously ruled that the deal would not be allowed to go ahead back in April, citing concerns on Microsoft&#x27;s current, and potentially future, dominance in cloud gaming. 
Despite that setback, Microsoft has continued to sign deals with other companies and took on the US Federal Trade Commission in court (and won), leaving the UK&#x27;s stance to the deal looking increasingly isolated. And it&#x27;s these fresh commitments, Microsoft says, which should now be considered by the CMA. Had the CMA made its original decision with these in mind, Microsoft now says, the CMA would have ruled differently.

The beta was announced by Hideaki Nishino on the official PlayStation blog earlier today, along with what to expect and how users can take part.
One of PlayStation&#x27;s latest accessibility features allows for a second controller to be added to an account to act as an assist controller. Together, the two controllers will act as one, making it easier, for example, for parents to help children on a difficult section of a game.

                              <span>New photos and a video which show filming of Amazon Prime&#x27;s upcoming Fallout TV adaptation have leaked online.
Filming looks to be taking place at a set depicting a Vault-Tec building, with the company&#x27;s logo painted in white on the floor. One zoomed-in photo shows a van with the writing &quot;Hawthorne Medical Laboratories - A Division of Vault-Tec Corporation&quot;, further suggesting the set is a Vault-Tec office of some sort. 
Another photo shows an actor filming dressed up in armour and holding a taped together gun, and in the background there looks to be another actor in a white lab coat.

                              <span>Masahiro Sakurai, chief developer behind Nintendo&#x27;s hugely-successful Super Smash Bros. series, has discussed the future of the franchise and his involvement in it.


Sakurai has previously discussed his possible exit from the series after working on it for much of the past two decades. In 2021, with DLC support for Smash Bros. Ultimate finally beginning to wind down, Sakurai even discussed the idea of retirement. 


Now, however, Sakurai appears to have changed his mind.

                              <span>DICE has confirmed that Battlefield 2042&#x27;s Update 5.2 will roll out next week.

The update will include a &quot;map rework&quot; of Hourglass – expect improved line of sight, traversal, and &quot;combat encounters&quot; now the size has been reduced – as well as all-out warfare attachments for vault weapons SMGs and LMGs, better squad management through improved squad orders, better ammo crates, and dispersion tweaks to SMGs and LMGs.

The rationale behind shrinking the Hourglass map is to &quot;keep combat focused while having more opportunity to defend yourself through added cover&quot;.

That one works on the ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo model, and causes it to bypass its safety rules about not telling people how to build bombs.
Look at the prompt. It’s the stuff at the end that causes the LLM to break out of its constraints. The paper shows how those can be automatically generated. And we have no idea how to patch those vulnerabilities in general. (The GPT people can patch against the specific one in the example, but there are infinitely more where that came from.)...</span>

Popping up on the ESRB website, the sequel has been slapped with a Mature/17+ rating in the US due to its &quot;blood and gore&quot; and &quot;intense violence&quot;, suggesting its on track to release later this year as planned.

&quot;This is an action game in which players assume the role of soldiers attempting to win an intergalactic war,&quot; begins the game&#x27;s description on the website.

Rumours started to fly yesterday, when HypeX tweeted that a &quot;very beloved and well-known&quot; anime collaboration was on the way. Since then, others have stepped forward to claim that that anime is Jujutsu Kaisen.

                              <span>Earlier this week, after countless rumours and leaks, GameMill finally confirmed that Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 was indeed on the way. Now, however, it seems retailers may have jumped the gun and are listing the game as launching on 24th October.

Whilst we can only take this with the requisite bucket of salt for now, retailers like Amazon UK and Best Buy in the US have already listed the game as releasing at the end of October, even though the launch date has not been formally – or publicly – confirmed. 

The release date has caused quite a commotion with fans of the fighting game, as it releases near or on the same day as highly-anticipated titles like the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection, Sonic Superstars, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, and Spider-Man 2.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage will take just 25 hours to complete – or less, if you&#x27;re not looking to do a &quot;completionist&quot; run. 

In an interview with French YouTuber Julien Chièze – spotted and translated by PCGN – Ubisoft lead producer Fabian Salomon has confirmed that during internal playtesting, it took most players around 20 hours to complete Mirage if they &quot;rushed&quot;, and &quot;25-30 hours for completionists&quot;.

&quot;Given that we do a lot of playtesting internally at Ubisoft, it&#x27;s part of our process, we really want to get as close as possible to the players, so we&#x27;ll say that the latest playtimes we&#x27;ve received average at around 20-23 hours,&quot; Salomon said.

                              <span>The next Pokémon Presents will take place on 8th August.

That&#x27;s according to noted dataminer CentroLeaks, who has trawled through the code of the Pokémon Masters EX and discovered what they believe to be confirmation of an upcoming campaign coming to the mobile game.

Given most recent Pokémon Presents shows have been coupled with in-game events across the Pokémon catalogue, some fans now believe that this confirms a Presents is on the way.

A new trailer dropped earlier today shows off Lui Kang&#x27;s &quot;old friend&quot; in fist-flying action, as well as tease an ominous outcome for the Fire God&#x27;s new world order. 

As Lui Kang himself explains, &quot;Geras is the guardian of the hourglass, a celestial object which lies beyond the realms. The hourglass regulates time and destiny&quot;.

And with the game coming to Xbox consoles next year, there will be a whole new audience looking to start their adventure.

Producer and director Naoki Yoshida likened the game to a TV show that players can binge from the start, and highlighted the Duty Support system as a way to ease in newer players.

The patch will come in two story parts that will set up the narrative ahead of the release of the next full expansion, Dawntrail, in summer 2024 - as announced yesterday at the Fan Fest in Las Vegas.


Along with various quests and additions, the Duty Support system will now allow players to experience all duties from A Realm Reborn to the end of Endwalker completely solo.

That may not sound impressive given PUBG: Battlegrounds holds the top spot with 3.2 million concurrent users – dwarfing that of second place CS:GO&#x27;s 1.8m peak – but it&#x27;s a considerable achievement, eclipsing the top concurrent Steam totals for games like Resident Evil Village (106,000), Battlefield 2042 (105,000), and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (103,000).

Its predecessor, Remnant, holds a more modest concurrent record of 48,289 players on Steam, according to SteamDB.

Whilst a number of characters have already been confirmed as returning to the eighth iteration of the fan-favourite fighting game, at least half a dozen names that popped up on Cheat Engine&#x27;s list are presently unannounced. 

Tekken 8&#x27;s recent closed network test allowed players to sample five stages and 16 playable characters, including Asuka Kazama, Bryan Fury, Claudio Serafino, Hwoarang, Jin Kazama, Jun Kazama, Leroy Smith, and Nina Williams, and Paul Phoenix, amongst others.

                              <span>Blizzard has vowed to buff Diablo 4&#x27;s Sorcerers and Barbarians following a backlash from fans over its latest patch.

In another fireside chat with key members of the development team, the team confirmed that when Patch 1.1.1 rolls out on 8th August, you&#x27;ll see improved &quot;effectiveness and fun&quot; for Sorcerers and Barbarians.

&quot;Our goal is to find a way – and we&#x27;re working on it right now – for all those different ways of dealing damage to have a lot of parity,&quot; lead class designer Adam Jackson explained.

                              <span>The original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has shut down its servers to prevent the spread of what is widely thought to be a malware attack.

Not to be confused with the more contemporary 2023 game of the same name which runs on different servers and remains unaffected, Activision was forced to take the 2009 version offline on Steam whilst it &quot;investigated reports of an issue&quot;.

Although Activision hasn&#x27;t confirmed what the alleged &quot;issue&quot; is, players believe it is connected to a post shared on the game&#x27;s Steam forums back in June that warned players to run an antivirus scan, positing that a trojan was being spread almost players &quot;using hacked lobbies&quot;.

Last week, Sony and Insomniac Games revealed new hardware to celebrate the upcoming launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. This included the Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition Bundle, a custom PS5 console cover design, a matching DualSense wireless controller, and Spidey-themed cover plates. 

While the limited edition console itself still has limited availability, pre-orders for the custom controller and the two PS5 cover plates – one for the digital edition, one for the standard one – have already sold out.

                              <span>Path of Exile 2 will not be released this year in any form. The plan, as it stands, is for a closed beta test to begin 7th June 2024.
Developer Grinding Gear Games revealed this to me and a group of press during a briefing ahead of ExileCon in New Zealand this weekend.
The silence around Path of Exile 2 has been almost total since it was announced in 2019. We&#x27;ve seen two chunks of gameplay and that&#x27;s it. The reason for this silence is because the game has changed significantly since then. Originally, it was going to be an extension of Path of Exile 1 and share content with it,  but now, Path of Exile 2 is a completely separate game.

                              <span>Ratata Arts has released a new Ratatan gameplay trailer, to whet appetites for the rhythm strategy game.


The developer said Ratatan&#x27;s gameplay will incorporate a &quot;unique combination of rhythm and strategy&quot;, and see players taking on the role of a conductor. This conductor has the very important job of controlling an army of the titular Ratatan, which will be able to &quot;attack, defend and support&quot; as they march against other armies in the game. 


Additionally, these music loving animal-like creatures will be able to &quot;gather &#x27;Cobuns&#x27; that can chant, move and attack according to the instructions&quot;. As a result of all this musical mayhem, the developer has promised &quot;one massive rhythmic showdown!&quot; You can see how it all looks in the video below.

                              <span>Hexworks has released an extended gameplay presentation for Lords of the Fallen, and as we have come to expect, it looks exquisite.


The presentation gave us another chance to see the harrowing environments we will be presented with on release. We will be able to explore Axiom, the realm of the living, and Umbral, the realm of the dead.


Each of these realms will have their own enemies, characters, treasures and the like. One example of an enemy in Umbral was a rather unusual head with arms and legs, but no body. This chap is known as a &#x27;Mendacious Visage&#x27;, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to meet him on a dark night (although, that is probably exactly what will happen whenever I play the game). There was also another enemy that reminded me of Silent Hill&#x27;s Pyramid Head.

Along with all the expected accoutrements such as new maps and weapons, the team also revealed its lineup of upcoming operators. These include Snoop Dogg, Nicki Minaj and 21 Savage, who all join Call of Duty as part of a 50-year celebration of Hip Hop over the course of the season. 


Snoop Dog has previously appeared in Call of Duty, and keeping with tradition is set to be &quot;ready for any operation, whether it&#x27;s going under Deep Cover or going in guns blazin&#x27;...&quot; After all, as the Call of Duty team explained: &quot;At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a Doggy Dogg World, and we&#x27;re living in it.&quot;

                              <span>Pikmin 4 has launched with a strong start in Japan, with sales of 401k boxed copies over its first week on sale. 


To put that into context, this is better than the total boxed sales of Pikmin&#x27;s three previous Japanese launch weeks combined: with 101k sales for Pikmin 1 and 161k first week sales of Pikmin 2 - both on the GameCube - and 92k first week sales of Pikmin 3 on Wii U.


These numbers from Japanese sales company Famitsu (via VGC) paint a rosy picture, although the comparisons here come with caveats - for instance, that Switch has a far higher userbase than either GameCube or Wii U - and this game has seen heavy promotion in Japan in particular.

                              <span>Interesting research: “(Ab)using Images and Sounds for Indirect Instruction Injection in Multi-Modal LLMs“:
Abstract: We demonstrate how images and sounds can be used for indirect prompt and instruction injection in multi-modal LLMs. An attacker generates an adversarial perturbation corresponding to the prompt and blends it into an image or audio recording. When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker’s instruction. We illustrate this attack with several proof-of-concept examples targeting LLaVa and PandaGPT...</span>
