                <p>Call of Duty: Warzone players are using the 6x6 cargo truck vehicle to great effect in what's dubbed the "Big Bertha meta".
This vehicle is pretty much a rolling fortress, and is big enough to give you significant cover across the battle royale's map. It can also tank damage for most of the match.
The Big Bertha meta is particularly popular in solos, when you're playing Warzone on your own against 149 other solo players. You can see players heading straight for a Big Bertha upon parachuting out of a chopper…</p>

                <p>Paradox has temporarily shelved Imperator: Rome to focus on other projects.
In a post on its forum titled "update of the organisation at PDS", the company outlined various internal changes made to its main development studio earlier this year.
The 150-person strong strategy studio is now split into three distinct studios: PDS Green, PDS Red, and PDS Gold. Each team is in charge of maintaining existing games and developing new games set to be announced at PDXCON, the company's upcoming showcase event.

With the game struggling to run on last-gen consoles, CD Projekt eventually started providing players with refunds, while Sony fully removed the game from the PlayStation Store (from which it still remains absent). CD Projekt has since issued various apologies for the launch, promising to continue patching the game and fixing its many bugs.

                <p>Gentle indie farming sim Stardew Valley was a pretty soothing experience already. Now, however, its tuneful MIDI-esque soundtrack has taken on an even more soporific sound, via an album of cover lullabies.
Prescription for Sleep: Stardew Valley is a 12-track album produced by creator Eric Barone and written by Gentle Love - a duo comprised of Metal Gear Solid composer Norihiko Hibino and Etrian Odyssey pianist Ayaki. 
This is the latest in a line of similar lullaby albums featuring video game music from Gen…</p>

                <p>Konami is still fighting the good fight when it comes to football video game licences - it's just nabbed the exclusive on Italian club Napoli.
The marketing partnership starts from next season, but Napoli becomes a genuine PES exclusive from the 2022/23 season, Konami said.
It's a similar deal to the one Konami signed for Cristiano Ronaldo's Juventus, which forced rival EA Sports to come up with a fake name for the Old Lady in FIFA 21. So, expect EA Sports to have to come up with a fake name for Napoli in 2…</p>

This version, named Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom: Prince's Edition, has popped up on the ESA ratings board with no further explanation (as spotted by Gematsu).
Originally released for PC and PlayStation 4 back in 2018, this role-playing game sequel later received a smattering of DLC add-ons. Presumably the "Prince's Edition" Nintendo Switch version will wrap these in?

According to the 2019 documentary La Traque de Rédoine Faïd, detective units scoured records of cell phones used during his escape, isolating a handful of numbers active at the time that went silent shortly thereafter.</p>

The Ingress resource is one of the many Kubernetes success stories. It created a diverse ecosystem of Ingress controllers which were used across hundreds of thousands of clusters in a standardized and consistent way.

Graceful node shutdown, beta in 1.21, enables kubelet to gracefully evict pods during a node shutdown.
Kubernetes is a distributed system and as such we need to be prepared for inevitable failures — nodes will fail, containers might crash or be restarted, and - ideally - your workloads will be able to withstand these catastrophic events.

Once you have containerized a non-parallel Job,
it is quite easy to get it up and running on Kubernetes without modifications to
the binary. In most cases, when running parallel distributed Jobs, you had
to set a separate system to partition the work among the workers. For
example, you could set up a task queue to assign one work item to each
Pod or multiple items
to each Pod until the queue is emptied.

In Kubernetes v1.21, the
CronJob resource
reached general availability (GA). We've also substantially improved the
performance of CronJobs since Kubernetes v1.19, by implementing a new
controller.
In Kubernetes v1.20 we launched a revised v2 controller for CronJobs,
initially as an alpha feature. Kubernetes 1.21 uses the newer controller by
default, and the CronJob resource itself is now GA (group version: batch/v1).
