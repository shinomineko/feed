Introduction
In Kubernetes, a Node is a representation of a single machine in your cluster. SIG Node owns that very important Node component and supports various subprojects such as Kubelet, Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and more to support how the pods and host resources interact. In this blog, we have summarized our conversation with Elana Hashman (EH) &amp; Sergey Kanzhelev (SK), who walk us through the various aspects of being a part of the SIG and share some insights about how others can get involved.
A summary of our conversation
Could you tell us a little about what SIG Node does?
SK: SIG Node is a vertical SIG responsible for the components that support the controlled interactions between the pods and host resources. We manage the lifecycle of pods that…</span>

                    <span>Marvel&#x27;s Avengers developer Crystal Dynamics has confirmed that long-awaited roster addition, Spider-Man - who will only be available on PlayStation consoles - will &quot;for sure&quot; have his own story mission and cutscenes.
It should be good news to fans of the action-adventure game who have seen little about Spidey&#x27;s pending arrival up until this point, even though he&#x27;s expected to release by the end of the year.
As spotted by MP1st (thanks, TheGamer), Crystal Dynamics&#x27; Dan Matlack responded to a question on the game&#x27;s Discord server that enquired whether or not Spider-Man would have his own story.

&quot;Season 3 is just a short way away, and we&#x27;ve got a lot to cover with everything that&#x27;s goin&#x27; on around here,&quot; developer Velan teased in an update on the official EA website. 
&quot;Speaking of, it&#x27;s a little... different out there. Seems like the DJ isn&#x27;t the only one who&#x27;s been paying attention to what&#x27;s going on in Knockout City - looks like we got an extra visitor here with us. Keeps poppin&#x27; in and lookin&#x27; around, calls themself Z3R0. Not sure how they got here, but pretty sure it&#x27;s got something to do with this Season&#x27;s theme. They&#x27;ve taken over the airwaves and it sounds like they&#x27;re here to stay.&quot;

                    <span>Double Fine has revealed what happened to Ford Cruller at the end of the original Psychonauts game.
While initially shared only with the game&#x27;s crowdfunding Fig backers a month ago alongside the sequel&#x27;s highly-anticipated release, the video is now available to all via the studio&#x27;s website.   
Yes, there are spoilers - so be wary if you&#x27;ve yet to play the first instalment - but as spotted by PCGN, the three minute teaser video explores what happened to ex-Psychonaut - and mentor - Cruller immediately after the credits on the first game rolled.

                    <span>Oh look, the PS Plus free game line-up has leaked again. Rumour has it the upcoming freebies will include Hell Let Loose for PS5, and Mortal Kombat X and PGA Tour 2K21 for PS4.
The information once again comes courtesy of French forum Dealabs, which correctly posted September&#x27;s offerings before they&#x27;d been formally confirmed by Sony last month. And once again, the moderation team says it satisfactorily reviewed evidence of the leak in order to let the post remain online (thanks, VGC).
Hell Let Loose - a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter video game that sees players fight in battles of the Western and Eastern Fronts of World War 2 - has been out on PC since the summer, but isn&#x27;t coming to consoles until next month.

                    <span>The second season of Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher show might not have been released yet, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped Netflix from announcing a third series. 
Showrunner Lauren Hissrich confirmed the news by tweeting, &quot;Season Three. Let&#x27;s do this, baby&quot; and including the updated animated logo for the next season. 
We also got three new teasers for the upcoming second series, too; check out the &quot;Road to Season 2&quot; trailer above, which summarises what&#x27;s happened in the show thus far, whereas below, you can get a first look at Geralt and Ciri in the second season, as well as another &quot;first look&quot; at Nivellen.

                    <span>Arcane, Netflix&#x27;s League of Legends animated series, begins on 6th November (2am UK time on 7th November).
The announcement was made via a new trailer, below, released as part of Netflix&#x27;s Tudum event (yes, it&#x27;s named after the noise Netflix makes when it loads).
Arcane is set within the world of Riot&#x27;s hugely successful MOBA League of Legends, and tells the story of two of the video game&#x27;s most popular champions: sisters Jinx and Vi. It revolves around the tension between the utopian region of Piltover and the oppressed underground of Zaun, which hits boiling point after the invention of Hextech technology.

GOG is a storefront whose brand is built upon selling games &quot;DRM free&quot; - that is, they can be played offline.
Hitman&#x27;s GOG page, like that of so many games on the platform, highlights that it is DRM free. &quot;No activation or online connection required to play,&quot; reads the prominent message.

                    <span>PlayStation 2 classic Ico has turned 20 years old.
In the 2001 adventure game, developed by Japan Studio and Team Ico and directed by Fumito Ueda, you play a young boy born with horns who encounters a princess called Yorda. The pair work to escape a castle, while Ico helps Yorda evade shadowy creatures.
The hook - apart from Ico&#x27;s gorgeous, minimalist visuals and design - is the player controls Ico while assisting Yorda. Digital Foundry revisited Ico in the video, below:

                    <span>Art of Rally comes out on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 6th October, developer Funselektor has announced.
The PlayStation release of this stylish take on off-road driving includes all the previous updates in all the previously released versions, with new tracks, cars, environments and improvements now as standard. The new trailer is below:
Art of Rally, which initially launched on PC toward the end of last year, delivers a top-down, faintly retro twist on the rally racing formula, sending players careening across low-poly renditions of Finland, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sardinia.

                    <span>Fall Guys has a Guinness World Record for being the most downloaded PlayStation Plus game ever.
Developer Mediatonic made the announcement on its website - without saying exactly how many PlayStation Plus downloads it has seen.
Fall Guys exploded onto the scene last summer, launching on PC, and on PlayStation 4 straight into PlayStation Plus. Its clever combination of platforming and battle royale made for fun and addictive arcade gameplay, and 24 hours after release it had more than 1.5 million players. As of December 2020, Fall Guys had sold more than 11m copies on PC alone.

                    <span>Work on the new and improved version of Dwarf Fortress is ongoing. To tide us over, we have a new 10 minute gameplay video showing off the game&#x27;s graphics.
The video below shows the new Desert Fortress in action. We see the new menus, a first look at the desert terrain, and what it looks like underground.
Dwarf Fortress is perhaps the deepest simulation of a world ever created, an infamously complex. It has for years had ASCII dwarves - little smiley faces fewer pixels than the average emoji. For the upcoming Steam release, Dwarf Fortress is getting actual graphics and much more in a bid to make it a tad accessible.

                    <span>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - pretty much the best Space Marine game ever made - turned 10 years old this week, and to celebrate it received a special Anniversary Edition on PC (thanks, PCGamesN).
Space Marine was developed by Dawn of War and Company of Heroes maker Relic Entertainment for release in 2011 on PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Relic left its strategy roots behind to create a fun third-person hack-and-slash/shooter hybrid that, while failing to set tills alight for now defunct publisher THQ, went down well among Warhammer 40,000 fans. You play an Ultramarine versus the Orks, with a heavy emphasis on melee (you heal via executions). It&#x27;s a bloodfest.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s latest technical preview (this one feels pretty much like a beta but with limited-time matchmaking) is in full swing - and players are coming up with some amazing trick shots.
I managed around four hours of play last night, and found myself on the receiving end of the new grappling hook more times than I would have liked. But it&#x27;s the new repulsor equipment that I think may be one of the best additions across the entire game.
Trigger the repulsor and your spartan holds out their arm for a brief moment to deflect oncoming grenades and rockets. The idea is you can bat enemy grenades back at their sender, hopefully for a kill.

                    <span>Asmodee Digital&#x27;s video game adaptation of acclaimed co-op board game Gloomhaven is, after more than two years in Steam Early Access, getting its version 1.0 release on 20th October.
The original board game iteration of Gloomhaven, designed by Isaac Childres, is a sprawling, turn-based tactical dungeon crawler set in a persistent fantasy world that&#x27;s packed with characters, items, and scenarios, all gradually unlocking over the course of a 100+ hour campaign. It&#x27;s a thrilling, richly designed, and all-round fantastic RPG experience, and one that also happens to come in a box big enough to kill a man.
As such (plus the fact the original board game retails for around £100), the prospect of a cheaper, more manageable digital iteration of Gloomhaven is an enticing one indeed - and the good news is the PC release, developed by Flaming Fowl Studios, has been widely praised during early access. It isn&#x27;t quite a 1:1 interpretation (which Flaming Fowl say is neither possible or desirable), but all differences have been discussed with Childres and the end result is a &quot;very faithful adaptation of the original gameplay and design.&quot;

                    <span>Life is Strange Remastered, Square Enix&#x27;s spruce up of Life is Strange 1 and its prequel Before the Storm, has been given a new release date of 1st February 2022 following its recent delay.
Life is Strange Remastered was originally due to arrive at the end of this month, two weeks after new series entry Life is Strange: True Colors, but Square made the decision to postpone its release back in August, citing &quot;the ongoing challenges of the worldwide pandemic&quot;.
At the time, it offered a revised launch window of &quot;early 2022&quot;, but Square has now properly shoved a pin in its calendar, announcing a new release date of 1st February next year on all previously confirmed platforms - Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia.

                    <span>As revealed during last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, N64 and Mega Drive games are finally heading to Nintendo Switch Online, and they&#x27;ll be accompanied by physical controllers inspired by both platforms. Over in Japan, Nintendo also confirmed Mega Drive&#x27;s much-loved six button pad variant will be available for purchase, but only in Japan.
Mega Drive&#x27;s six button controller released back in 1993 to coincide with the launch of Street Fighter 2: Special Champion Edition and would eventually be supported by over 60 games. Yet despite its enduring popularity around the world - especially among fighting game fans - Sega and Nintendo have opted to make Switch&#x27;s rendition of the six button pad exclusive to Japan. Everywhere else gets the three button original.
This isn&#x27;t the first time Sega has denied western audience six-button Mega Drive goodness, of course; exactly the same thing happened with the release of its dinky Mega Drive Mini back 2019 to the disappointment of some, with everywhere but Japan having to make do with the three-button pad - Sega presumably reckoning (both then and now) the original offered the most nostalgia value for the majority of western Mega Drive fans.

                    <span>Last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct graced us with the unexpected reveal of a Super Mario movie, along with a cast list of the main characters.
As you would expect, the internet became flooded with the reactions to the star-studded cast, mostly with cries of &quot;why!?&quot; and wishful thinking that it was all a fever dream. 
So, here&#x27;s a curated sample of the best memes in reaction to the announcement.

It&#x27;s the first formal statement to come from any of the parties involved since the court verdict was reached earlier this month. 
The statement reveals Cage and de Fondaumère had objected to seven passages in Mediapart&#x27;s article concerning their actions as executives at Quantic Dream, developer of Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. It also revealed details of offensive photomontages of staff and practices which raised questions under French labour law.

                    <span>Microsoft has announced a number of quality of life improvements and new features coming to Xbox.
The big new feature is Play Later, which allows you to curate your own list of titles from Xbox Game Pass which you can come back to another time. The new tab will show personalised recommendations that&#x27;s reminiscent of Steam&#x27;s discovery menu.
Next, the world&#x27;s most beloved browser, Microsoft Edge, has been updated on Xbox to the Chromium version (which shares the underlying code as Chrome) that was released on Windows PCs last year.

But it remains to be seen whether Nintendo will offer a simple switch between different localised copies, or offer the US 60Hz versions of games alongside the European 50Hz originals.

Guardian of Remembrance features new story content (Battle for Kakariko Village, Battle of Goponga Village, and more), new stages (including the Coliseum), an expanded roster (including Sheikah researchers Purah and Robbie), and new battle skills for existing characters. 
&quot;Zelda gets the Dynasty Warriors treatment once more, folding in inspiration from Breath of the Wild for the best musou spin-off yet,&quot; said Martin Robinson in Eurogamer&#x27;s review of the game.

Speaking via Instagram, Pratt said that getting to play Mario was proof &quot;dreams come true&quot; after he used to steal quarters from a local wishing well to play the Super Mario Bros. arcade game. 
&quot;There was this coin-operated laundromat by my house and it had Super Mario Bros., the original arcade game. I loved that game. I never had a quarter... I&#x27;d steal them from the wishing well.

Nvidia responded to the leak saying the games were &quot;speculative&quot; and &quot;used only for internal tracking and testing&quot;, though various projects on that list were reported to be real - if in some cases outdated.
Now, a new development gives further credence to the list&#x27;s reliability. Pavel Djundik, the dataminer and creator of SteamDB, said in a tweet that Ubisoft had issued him a DMCA notice for the list.

                    <span>The UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority has tightened some of its guidance around the advertising of in-game spending.
This new guidance covers adverts which might appear via in-game storefronts or platform stores as well as general advertising for games, and is aimed at stopping adverts which might mislead consumers on the existence and price of microtransactions, how items might affect gameplay, and pressure you into a purchase.
However, the ASA conceded a difference in games which allow you to only purchase a premium currency, rather than ones which let you earn some of it too. The conclusion was that the ASA would treat games differently which view an in-game currency as a direct analogue to real-world money.

The clips below, posted on Reddit (thanks,MP1st), show what appears to be a match of Conquest in the Grand Bazaar map, filled with infantry and vehicles.

It&#x27;s a hugely surprising development considering the fact this reboot was, until now, an entirely first-party project. Crystal Dynamics, meanwhile, is a subsidiary of Square Enix. 
But it does make some sense. The Initiative, Microsoft&#x27;s Santa Monica-based team set up to work on the project, was founded by former Crystal Dynamics boss Darrel Gallagher, and also counts Tomb Raider reboot director Daniel Neuburger among its ranks.

I just wanted to say that you created weapons of mass destruction where niches remained poor and the rich got richer! When bitcoin first appeared, I was small, and alas, my family lost everything on this, you won’t find an apple in the winter garden, people only need strength and money. Sorry for the English, I am from Russia, I can write with errors. You are an amazingly intelligent person, very intelligent, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

                    <span>The MIT Technology Review is reporting that 2021 is a blockbuster year for zero-day exploits:
One contributing factor in the higher rate of reported zero-days is the rapid global proliferation of hacking tools.
Powerful groups are all pouring heaps of cash into zero-days to use for themselves — and they’re reaping the rewards.
At the top of the food chain are the government-sponsored hackers. China alone is suspected to be responsible for nine zero-days this year, says Jared Semrau, a director of vulnerability and exploitation at the American cybersecurity firm FireEye Mandiant.

                    <span>Another Nintendo Direct has been and gone, bringing with it new looks at previously announced games, a couple of reveals we were expecting thanks to good old Mr. Leaky, and a handful of surprises. And if you missed it all, here&#x27;s the whole thing conveniently summarised.
First up was the announcement Monster Hunter Rise is getting a &quot;massive&quot; expansion. It&#x27;s called Sunbreak and will introduce new stories, locations, and monsters, as well as new gameplay mechanics and a new quest rank. Expect to see it next summer.
The Animal Crossing: New Horizons drought is finally over and the series&#x27; much-loved pigeon barista Brewster will arrive in a new update later this year. There&#x27;s no release date yet, but Nintendo says it&#x27;ll reveal more in October.

Even better, we heard it would be released soon - on 28th October - with a free demo available from the Nintendo eShop today. Oh, and it&#x27;s also coming to PlayStation 4 and PC. 
&quot;Players will square off in experiences that reveal themselves through cards, including turn-based battles, where their skills - and a little bit of luck - will determine the victor,&quot; the game&#x27;s blurb reads, describing Voice of Cards as a &quot;fresh take on tabletop RPGs&quot;.

                    <span>Nintendo has released a fresh look at Switch-exclusive shooter Splatoon 3.
The video below shows off new and returning stages in 4v4 battles, and new weapons.
The trailer then goes off the deep end with a tease for the single-player campaign. The video is called Return of the Mammalians, but it&#x27;s hard to make much sense of what we&#x27;re seeing.

                    <span>Bayonetta 3 is alive and kicking.
Platinum&#x27;s action game starred in tonight&#x27;s Nintendo Direct with a new trailer, below, and a 2022 release window.
The video shows off plenty of action, with Bayonetta revealing her new look and what sounds like a new voice actress. There&#x27;s all the over-the-top fighting you&#x27;d expect from the series, and a big boss to boot. This time, Bayonetta can directly control demons.

                    <span>If it&#x27;s leftfield announcements you&#x27;re after, how about this one? Cult-classic Super Nintendo game Actraiser is getting the remaster treatment, and you won&#x27;t have long to wait to play it - it&#x27;s out now on Switch, PlayStation 4, PC, iOS, and Android.
ActRaiser initially released for Super Nintendo back in 1990, drawing praise for its unusual combination of side-scrolling, sword-swinging action-platforming and god-game-like top-down urban planning as players, in the role of the Lord of Light, attempted to save mankind from the evil Lord of Dark. Oh, and it had some cracking music too.
All of that returns in the newly announced ActRaiser Renaissance, which features &quot;remastered&quot; 2D new visuals, new stories, expanded action and realm management gameplay, new action stages, a new realm and boss, plus new music - including 15 new tracks and re-arranged original music by Actraiser composer Yuzo Koshiro. There&#x27;s also auto-save and difficulty options.

This is a port of BioWare&#x27;s original role-playing masterpiece, courtesy of Aspyr. There&#x27;s no word on a Nintendo Switch version of the KOTOR remake, also in development at Aspyr - that&#x27;s currently set for PC and PlayStation 5 as a timed console exclusive.
We&#x27;ve written plenty about KOTOR over the years. Give Bertie&#x27;s lovely piece on his favourite planet, the twisted and scarred Malachor V, a read.

14 Sega Mega Drive games coming at launch include Ecco the Dolphin, Streets of Rage 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, with more to follow.

Chocobo GP is coming to Switch in 2022, and takes characters familiar from the Final Fantasy series and puts them into the comforting mold of the kart racer. There are chocobos, moogles and mages, all squished into karts and using magicite to take each other down in their efforts to cross the finish line first.

Disco Elysium is the compelling role-playing game from ZA/UM that first launched in 2019. You play a washed up detective who solves a murder while dealing with stuff. It&#x27;s a fantastic game I enjoyed very much. You should play it!

Specifics are near-non-existent at present, but, in its brief announcement post, Capcom teased a &quot;massive amount&quot; of content in this &quot;new, ominous chapter&quot; of Monster Hunter Rise, including new stories, locations, and monsters.
Players can also expect new hunting actions and a new quest rank - very much in the same vein as Monster Hunter World&#x27;s Iceborne expansion, although probably not quite as frosty going by its name - with Capcom promising more details at a later date. Here&#x27;s a first teaser trailer:

This latest exhibit-enhancing paid DLC - the seventh, following on from Planet Zoo&#x27;s Africa, Aquatic, Australia, Arctic, South America, and South East Asia Animal Packs - introduces a total of seven new creatures to developer Frontier&#x27;s zoo-themed management sim.
The American beaver, moose, California sea lion, cougar, American alligator, black-tailed prairie dog, and arctic fox are all new habitat animals, meaning you&#x27;ll need to get your enclosure-designing hat on to give them a good home, and there&#x27;s a single exhibit animal addition in the form of the American Bullfrog.

At the time, it was only available in North America, but now, to the presumed delight of more local, musically minded Last of Us fans, it&#x27;s made its way Europe.
In fact, Europe is getting two The Last of Us 2 inspired instruments - the aforementioned replica of Ellie&#x27;s guitar and a more affordably priced black and white custom Taylor GS Mini, featuring a design based on Ellie&#x27;s familiar tattoo.
Ellie&#x27;s instrument - in actuality, a custom Taylor 314ce - is described by Sony as featuring a &quot;distinctive rich tobacco sunburst top and a custom moth fretboard inlay in grained ivoroid&quot;, while the GS Mini features &quot;back and sides of layered sapele together with a solid mahogany top [producing] a bold, resonant acoustic sound with impressive volume and projection.&quot;

This battery powers an internal clock the console uses to check eligibility for game ownership. Without the battery - such as when it naturally drains - both physical and digital games are left unplayable without connecting online. 
Reports this week suggested the problem had been fixed in the v9.0 software update, even though it is not mentioned in Sony&#x27;s official patch notes. Our Digital Foundry team has since been able to corroborate this and confirm the problem is indeed now solved.

                    <span>Epic&#x27;s recent antitrust case against Apple - in which it lost all but one of its legal challenges - may be over for now, but the drama continues. Apple has told Epic it won&#x27;t be reinstating its Fortunite developer account until the appeal process is over - a decision that could mean the battle royale game remains unavailable on Apple devices for years.
Apple initially revoked Epic&#x27;s Fortnite developer account - blocking Fortnite from being distributed on its devices - last August, after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app - a move Apple has since called an &quot;intentional breach of contract&quot;.
Epic appealed the move unsuccessfully, and Fortnite has remained unavailable on Apple devices for the duration of its legal proceedings. However, now the court&#x27;s judgement has been passed - which included confirmation that Apple is within its rights to keep Fortnite off its App Store - Epic has once again attempted to have its developer account reinstated, this time by appealing directly to Apple.

In total, 149 Build Mode items from the base game have received new colour options as part of the update, including cups, curtains, windows, lamp shades, floorboards, action figures, bins, ovens (and other assorted kitchen appliances), plus a huge range of furniture - from bookshelves and coffee tables to chairs and beds.
The goal of all this, explains EA over on the official Sims 4 forum, is to &quot;complement and enhance [the game&#x27;s existing] assets so Simmers have more choices and have more use out of them&quot;. Certainly, if you&#x27;ve ever found yourself frustrated that you couldn&#x27;t match your window box to your wastebasket in the past, your prayers may finally have been answered.

                    <span>Developer Hinterland Games&#x27; superb sub-zero survival experience The Long Dark will finally receive its extremely long-awaited fourth story episode on 6th October.
Fury, Then Silence, as the Episode 4 is known, follows pilot Will Mackenzie&#x27;s desperate attempts to escape a murderous gang of convicts from one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island in order to continue his search for second protagonist Astrid.
Hinterland says Fury, Then Silence will feature between 7 and 10 hours of gameplay, 60 minutes of narrative cinematics, and over 40 minutes of new music, with its action unfolding in a brand-new region dominated by an old prison complex built in the shadow of Blackrock Mountain.

                    <span>Developer Cyanide Studio has announced it&#x27;s indefinitely delaying the early access PC launch of Blood Bowl 3 - the latest entry in the murderous, fantasy themed sports series - which was originally due to take place this September.
This, of course, isn&#x27;t the first delay for the game; Blood Bowl 3 was initially due to launch for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August, but a June rethink saw Cyanide and publisher Nacon postpone its full release into February next year. However, that extended delay was to be sweetened somewhat by an early access PC launch this September.
Now though, the game&#x27;s release has slipped once more, with Cyanide admitting its initial goal of a September early access launch &quot;was a bit too optimistic&quot; in a post to Twitter.

To date, your small, outdated Xbox 360 gamerpic has been lost to the mists of time if you set a larger, swankier gamerpic on newer platforms. 
But now, by popular demand, Microsoft is testing an option to revive your Xbox 360 gamerpic and set it as your current avatar image on new consoles.

Tune in for 40 minutes of announcements on upcoming Nintendo Switch games due this year - hopefully meaning a closer look at the promising Metroid Dread, Super Mario Party Superstars and Advance Wars 1 + 2: Re-Boot Camp, among others. 
Next year&#x27;s line-up, meanwhile, includes Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Splatoon 3 and (hopefully) the still-untitled Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sequel.

Metroid Dread will still release on 8th October, Nintendo confirmed, but the game&#x27;s amiibo 2-pack featuring Samus and an EMMI robot will now turn up later, on 5th November. 
In a post on its Twitter account, Nintendo of Europe apologised for the holdup, which it blamed on &quot;unforeseen shipping delays&quot;.

                    <span>In the beginning, there was one Cube. One single, solitary purple Cube to rule them all. Fortnite fans nicknamed it Kevin, and then watched with interest as it rumbled round the game&#x27;s old map before finally blowing up.
Three years later, Kevin is back, and this time it has brought some friends. Fortnite&#x27;s latest live event introduced us to a whole Cube civilisation, some of which have since made Fortite&#x27;s island their home.
Now, fans are working together to watch these new Cubes, as they move and reproduce in real-time.

                    <span>Arkane Studios has released a new patch for its acclaimed shooter Deathloop, aimed at tackling the widely reported stuttering issues affecting the PC version.
Reports of stuttering and poor framerates in the PC version began to surface soon after Deathloop&#x27;s launch last week, and Arkane was quick to respond, assuring players it was &quot;aware of reports&quot; and looking into the issue &quot;as a priority&quot;.
A little over a week later, Arkane&#x27;s first attempt at tackling the issue has arrived in Deathloop&#x27;s hotfix 1.708.4.0, which specifically addresses camera stuttering related to mouse movement.

                    <span>The Washington Post reports that the FBI had a decryption key for the REvil ransomware, but didn’t pass it along to victims because it would have disrupted an ongoing operation.
The key was obtained through access to the servers of the Russia-based criminal gang behind the July attack. Deploying it immediately could have helped the victims, including schools and hospitals, avoid what analysts estimate was millions of dollars in recovery costs.
But the FBI held on to the key, with the agreement of other agencies, in part because it was planning to carry out an operation to disrupt the hackers, a group known as REvil, and the bureau did not want to tip them off. Also, a government assessment found the harm was not as severe as initially feared...</span>

                    <span>Chacko Sonny, executive producer on Overwatch, has announced his departure from Blizzard Entertainment - the latest high-profile departure from a studio still embroiled in multiple legal wranglings stemming from a California lawsuit alleging a culture of sexual harassment and discrimination within the company.
News of Sonny&#x27;s departure comes via Bloomberg, which says the Overwatch producer told staff his last day would be this Friday, describing his time at Blizzard as &quot;an absolute privilege and one of the best experiences of my career&quot;. In a separate email, Blizzard co-leaders Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra called Sonny &quot;a thoughtful leader&quot;, and Bloomberg reports employees it spoke to say Sonny was well-respected within the company and that they weren&#x27;t aware of any allegations against him. An official statement provided to Polygon confirms Sonny&#x27;s departure, adding he is leaving to &quot;to take some time off after 5 years of service&quot;.
Sonny - who was overseeing the development of Overwatch 2 - leaves Blizzard almost exactly five months after the high-profile departure of Overwatch director and Blizzard Entertainment vice president Jeff Kaplan. However, despite these significant senior staffing changes, Blizzard insists Overwatch 2 is making &quot;excellent progress&quot; and &quot;is in the final stages of production&quot;, with more to be shared at the Overwatch League Grand Finals this weekend.

                    <span>Death Stranding players on PlayStation 4 eager to experience the new features arriving as part of the post-apocalyptic open-world ambling game&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation 5 Director&#x27;s Cut will be able to do so by upgrading for £5.
Previously, Sony revealed those looking to upgrade from the PlayStation 4 original to the PlayStation 5 Digital Deluxe Edition would be able to do so at a cost of €10/$10 USD, leaving many to assume a UK equivalent of around £10. However, the official PlayStation UK Twitter feed has now confirmed an upgrade cost of just £5.
That £5 - or £44.99 if you opt for full version of Death Stranding&#x27;s PS5 Director&#x27;s Cut (or somewhere in-between if you upgrade from a discounted PS4 physical copy) - will get you the compellingly mystifying original experience, complete with enhanced visuals, new story missions, new combat mechanics, a firing range, and even a racing mode. Oh and your PS4 saves will carry across too.

                    <span>Square Enix&#x27;s acclaimed JRPG sequel Neo: The World End With You will be making the leap from consoles to PC, as an Epic Games Store exclusive, next Tuesday, 28th September.
Neo - the long-awaited follow-up to the brilliant, mechanically dizzying The World Ends With You, which originally released on Nintendo DS back in 2007 - was highly praised when it launched on Switch and PlayStation earlier this year.
Square Enix&#x27;s sequel thrusts a fresh cast of characters into the deadly week-long Reapers&#x27; Game of the original, once again unfolding in a sort of otherworldly flip-side of the modern-day Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo - a location which retains the first game&#x27;s stunningly stylised art style, albeit this time successfully reimagined in full 3D.

                    <span>Developer Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s cult-classic action-horror Alan Wake could be making its way to Switch in its newly remastered guise, according to a new Brazilian ratings board listing.
As spotted by VGC, a (now removed) listing for a Switch version of Alan Wake Remastered has appeared alongside listings for the previously announced PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PlayStation 5 editions of the game on the Brazilian Classificação Indicativa website.
This is the first time word on a Switch version has surfaced, but certainly not the first time a Remedy game has appeared on Nintendo&#x27;s console - the studio&#x27;s acclaimed supernatural shooter Control made the leap to Switch in 2020, but as a streaming-only Cloud Version.

Earlier this month, Wata co-founder Mark Haspel was accused of breaking his own company rules on selling graded stock for a profit, in a detailed report which alleged a &quot;serious conflict of interest&quot;.

A report by Solidaires Informatique, translated by Eurogamer, states Le Monde&#x27;s case had been weakened as it was unable to prove certain elements of its reporting without divulging the anonymity of its sources.
Neither party has publicly commented on the judgement, and there&#x27;s no word yet on any terms.

Halo Infinite doesn&#x27;t have per-match XP - battle pass progression is tied to challenges instead.

                    <span>Apparently, a nation-state hacked Alaska’s Department of Health and Social Services.
Not sure why Alaska’s Department of Health and Social Services is of any interest to a nation-state, but that’s probably just my failure of imagination.</span>

                    <span>Following last week&#x27;s Sea of Thieves Season 4 teaser, Rare has provided a more substantial run-down of features pirates will be able to plunge into starting this Thursday, 23rd September.
Sea of Thieves&#x27; fourth season is all about expansion, but rather than out - as was the case when the Devil&#x27;s Shroud parted to grant access to the fiery Devil&#x27;s Roar back in 2018 - we&#x27;re going down, with new areas of the Sirens&#x27; vast underwater kingdom opening up all over the map, including six new Siren Shrines and a number of Siren Treasuries.
The former, as presented in the Season 4 trailer at least, appear to be more substantial dungeon-style activities, each promising &quot;unique challenges and threats&quot;, as well as plunder for those able to solve their mysteries.

                    <span>The Good Life - Deadly Premonition director Hidetaka &quot;Swery&quot; Suehiro&#x27;s intriguing &quot;daily life RPG&quot; murder-mystery adventure - finally has a release date and will be making its way to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 15th October.
When The Good Life successfully reached its Kickstarter goal back in 2018 (following a failed Fig crowdfunding campaign a year earlier), the expectation was that it would release in Q4 2019. However, that initial launch window was shifted back to spring 2020, and then to summer 2021, before receiving one last delay to this autumn.
But now, with a release date finally confirmed, The Good Life is almost here, meaning players will soon be able to step into the shoes of New York photojournalist Naomi, as she moves to the &quot;vast and sprawling&quot; backwoods British town of Rainy Woods to pay off her massive debt.

                    <span>Mick McGinty, the artist behind iconic video game covers such as the SNES version of Street Fighter 2 and the Mega Drive&#x27;s Kid Chameleon, has died following a battle with cancer. 
McGinty passed away peacefully surrounded by his family, his son Jobey wrote in a post which shared numerous memories of his father (thanks, VGDensetsu). 
&quot;My Dad was an incredible artist, as everyone knows,&quot; he wrote. &quot;And in true artist fashion, he was also never satisfied with his final work.  Just a couple weeks ago, he said he needed &#x27;just one more hour on a few pieces&#x27; in order to &#x27;really finish them&#x27;.  We all knew that just wasn&#x27;t true, though.  Dad would always come visit our house, see some of the paintings he did for us over the years, and would put his nose about an inch from it and say, &#x27;y&#x27;know, Jobe, I wish I would have made those blues a little deeper&#x27;, or &#x27;you know I&#x27;d love to just splash a little more shadows on that tree&#x27;, or &#x27;that really needs a fresh coat of varnish on it&#x27;.&quot;

                    <span>Nintendo fans finally found Luigi in Super Mario 64, after the source code of the game was leaked online. 
Now, a Sega fan has found Luigi somewhere even more unexpected - in a previously-unseen development build of Dreamcast racer Sega GT.
Luigi can be seen holding a stopwatch and chequered flag in one of the game&#x27;s levels, apparently as a joke temporarily put in by developers before the game was finalised and shipped to the public.

                    <span>Warhammer Online shut down eight years ago - but it lives on thanks to the work of dedicated fans.
Return of Reckoning is a Warhammer Online private server that has been going for some time now, but over the weekend achieved a quite impressive milestone: the release of two capital cities that were planned for the fantasy MMO but never made it into the official game.
The Dwarf home city of Karaz-A-Karak and the Greenskin home city of Karak Eight Peaks were two of four capital cities that appeared in the Warhammer Online beta but were removed prior to launch. Only two capital cities - Altdorf and The Inevitable City - ended up officially released.

                    <span>Niantic formally announced Catan: World Explorers back in June 2020, and rolled out access over the rest of last year to Australia and New Zealand, Denmark, Switzerland and Singapore. 
In a blog post published on Friday evening, Niantic broke the news that Catan would not be released further, and instead would be taken offline globally on 18th November.

                    <span>Deltarune&#x27;s third, fourth and fifth chapters will all arrive at the same time, creator Toby Fox has said. 
The second chapter of Undertale follow-up Deltarune arrived last week, following a three-year wait from the first. It also arrived for free - contrary to Fox&#x27;s previous plans. 
In a new blog post on Deltarune&#x27;s development, Fox said his &quot;next goal&quot; was to complete Chapters 3, 4, and 5, then ask people to purchase the game at a price that was fair for the first five chapters.

Microsoft released a gameplay video, below, showing a full multiplayer match.
In the match we see the Rus against the Holy Roman Empire, with useful commentary from developer Relic.

                    <span>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has pushed out a new update to celebrate the ghost investigation game&#x27;s first anniversary.
The Anniversary Update - I see what you did with the name there - is out now and introduces a handful of tweaks and improvements, including a journal &quot;overhaul&quot; that permits you to cross off evidence, change your settings, and generally make it &quot;easier to use and navigate&quot;. 
You can also play offline singleplayer without forcing you to connect to the server, and will no longer get a pity payment of $10 when you fail a contract; now you&#x27;ll &quot;get the insurance depending on the chosen difficulty&quot;. My favourite change might be that failing will also reveal what kind of ghost was terrorising you now, too.

                    <span>Now released from its three-game deal with Sony, Quantic Dream - developer of PlayStation exclusives Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, and Detroit: Become Human - has reportedly signed a deal with Disney and is rumoured to be working on a new Star Wars game.
It&#x27;s a timely rumour, not least because it coincides with LucasFilm moving away from its exclusivity deal with EA, including plans to make a new open-world game based on the fan-favourite franchise with Ubisoft.
&quot;They&#x27;ve now finished their contract with Sony and will be signing with Disney,&quot; French YouTuber Gautoz said in a video this week (thanks, VGC), hypothesising that Quantic&#x27;s recent push back on hostile work environment allegations was to preserve this newly forged partnership. &quot;It looks like they will be working on a Star Wars game.&quot;

While we already knew the show was making its triumphant return on E4 in the UK, a new press release explains that the programme will be back later this year with a &quot;social-first partnership&quot; with Facebook&#x27;s Oculus Quest 2.
Though the show is described as spanning social, digital and linear broadcast, all episodes will initially premiere on E4&#x27;s YouTube channel and will be followed by a linear play on E4.

If you missed the announcement teaser a couple of weeks back, here it is:
The Jackbox Party Pack 8 will feature five new games - Job Job, Weapons Drawn, Drawful Animate, the Wheel of Enormous Proportions, and Poll Mine. Here&#x27;s how the developer describes each of the new games courtesy of a recent blog post (thanks, TheGamer):

The problem first crept in a few days back, but despite fixes and assurances from Respawn that the issues had been rectified, the developer has since acknowledged that despite improvements, players are continuing to experience &quot;roughly three times the normal rate of disconnect errors&quot;.
&quot;We&#x27;re ramping up our server capacity today and have some scheduled fixes for tomorrow. However, we believe some problems will require work through the weekend,&quot; the team announced on Friday.

The heavily advertised anti-cheat measures have yet to be introduced, of course - which means the cheat systems players use in Warzone and Modern Warfare 2019 are very likely still functional - but nonetheless, the prevalence of in-game cheating is once again dominating the game&#x27;s reddit and social media pages.
Right now the beta is only available for those who&#x27;ve pre-ordered the shooter but already players are reporting - and even providing video evidence - of what seem to be wall hacks and other cheats (thanks, VGC).

&quot;We know that AFKs and leavers are some of the most disruptive behaviours you face, so we&#x27;re happy to be coming to you today with an update around AFK and Leaver punishments.&quot; wrote BarackProbama and TimTamMonster in s blog on the game&#x27;s official website.
Bundling both idle &quot;AFK&quot; behaviour and intentional quitters together as one single nuisance, the pair said that the team was introducing a number of new &quot;prongs&quot; to manage the issue, including new penalty &quot;tiers&quot; and a means of &quot;shielding&quot; players from repeat offenders.

Even if you&#x27;re not a music streaming subscriber, however, you can sample the wonder of Sonic&#x27;s music by the Tomoya Ohtani Band, Crush 40, and Sonic Adventure Music Experience by previewing the tracks right now on iTunes. No, you won&#x27;t get the full-length glory of the FILMharmonic Orchestra Prague renditions, but even the brief snippets of the preview tracks are a wonderful treat.

                    <span>Remember that surprise new mobile RPG that Sega teased yesterday? Well, people are already downvoting the reveal trailer on YouTube. 
Though we still don&#x27;t know very much about it at all - right now all we have is a very brief teaser and a website with very little information on it - fans are registering their dismay that it&#x27;s a mobile-only title in the only way they know how; by downvoting it.
Without knowing anything else about the new IP, the teaser trailer is currently racking up four times as many likes as dislikes on its Japanese-language YouTube account. While I can&#x27;t attest to the flavour of the comments left in Japanese, the majority of English-language comments seem unhappy that the game is seemingly only coming to mobile devices which leave some fearing it will be &quot;monetise[d] to death&quot;.

                    <span>Just like its predecessor, Dying Light 2 will feature weapon degradation.
Confirmation about the beleaguered zombie game&#x27;s combat came in the latest instalment of the game&#x27;s Dying 2 Know More series in which PR specialist Paulina Dziedziak spoke to producer Szymon Strauss.
However, things will be slightly different this time around. The team insists that because &quot;the world has changed&quot;, the weapons we used in the original game &quot;wore out&quot;. Although you&#x27;ll occasionally come across a &quot;high-tier&quot; ready-made weapon, they&#x27;re rare to find and pretty expensive, so we&#x27;ll mostly be &quot;building stuff from scraps and materials you find on the fly&quot;.

                    <span>Diablo 2: Resurrected director says players should &quot;do what they feel is right&quot; when deciding whether or not to support publisher Activision Blizzard by buying the remake when it goes on sale next week.
It&#x27;s the first game the company has released since allegations of a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture at Activision Blizzard were made by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, although it&#x27;s important to note that the lead developer here is Vicarious Visions, which has not been involved nor implicated in the legal complaint.
&quot;It was definitely very troubling to hear these types of things,&quot; design director Rob Gallerani told Axios (thanks, VGC). &quot;And we really wanted to support our colleagues and our co-workers.&quot;

                    <span>THQ has confirmed Jagged Alliance 3 is in development.
While there&#x27;s no estimated release window as yet, developer Haemimont Games - the same team behind recent Tropico games - has revealed the &quot;beloved series&quot; is coming &quot;soon&quot; to PC.
Here&#x27;s the announcement trailer, which debuted yesterday:

                    <span>Following some sneaky teasing earlier this year, and a spot of more recent leakage from Sony, THQ Nordic has officially confirmed that Destroy All Humans 2 is getting the remake treatment.
Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed, as THQ is calling its latest remake, will be &quot;developed from scratch&quot; in Unreal Engine 4 by Black Forest Games, the studio behind the striking 2020 remake of the original Destroy All Humans.
The sequel, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, initially released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox back in 2006, serving up a second helping of comedic ET action charting the continuing adventures of Crypto as he rampages across the 1960s following the destruction of his mothership by the KGB - a chaotic journey that sees him soaking up (and blowing up) the sights in the US, UK, Soviet Union, Japan, and even to the moon. Expect all that in the remake, only prettier.

                    <span>A sequel to cult-classic sci-fi adventure Outcast is in the works, with original developer Appeal Studios once again at the helm.
Outcast 2: A New Beginning, as the sequel is known, unfolds 20 years after the original adventure (which released back in 1999) as preposterously named series protagonist, and ex-Navy Seal, Cutter Slade returns for another jaunt across the alien world of Adelpha. 
This time, the planet is under threat of invasion, as a ruthless army of robots begins enslaving and murdering its citizens. Cutter&#x27;s mission - unfolding as a 3rd-person open-world action-adventure that should be familiar to fans of the original - is to mount a resistance, liberate the people, and rid Adelpha of the robot invaders once and for all.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s schedule of Capcom-themed crossovers continues next Friday, 24th September, with the arrival of long-serving Mega Man character, Rush.
Capcom&#x27;s Mega Man crossover - the fourth post-launch collaboration update to release for Monster Hunter Rise since its launch back in March - follows cameos for the likes of Okami&#x27;s Amaterasu and Street Fighter 5&#x27;s Akuma.
This time, though, players will be able to unlock a brand-new piece of layered armour turning their trusty Palamute companion into the Mega Man series&#x27; robo-canine Rush, even replacing the standard Palamute dash animation with the Rush Jet ability.

                    <span>Yuji Naka, famed creator of Sonic the Hedgehog, has revealed he&#x27;s teaching himself how to program his own smartphone game following his departure from Square Enix earlier this year.
Naka joined Square Enix in 2018, and his first project with the publisher - action-platformer Balan Wonderworld - was announced last summer for release this year. Unfortunately, Balan Wonderland was met with generally unfavourable reviews and disappointing sales when it launched in April, and Naka confirmed his departure from Square Enix in June. At the time, he told Twitter, &quot;I&#x27;m 55 years old, so I may retire.&quot;
It seems Naka has been busy since then, however, and he&#x27;s celebrated his birthday today by revealing some of what he&#x27;s been up to since leaving Square. &quot;Thank you for your birthday message,&quot; he wrote on Twitter. &quot;Recently I&#x27;ve started studying programs again, and I&#x27;m making a simple game for smartphones with Unity.&quot;

In a response to a tweet by KFCGaming of all places, the official Splitgate account announced the plans. 
Forge mode, which made its debut in Bungie&#x27;s Halo 3, lets players edit and create playable maps that can then be shared with the community.

                    <span>Dota 2 will soon remove support for 32-bit systems, Valve has warned.
The mega-popular MOBA launched eight years ago, and Valve said it&#x27;s time to leave older tech behind.
So, in the coming months, Dota 2 players will need to have a 64-bit machine and operating system to run the game.

                    <span>When we finally got a first look at God Of War Ragnarok during the PlayStation Showcase last week, Sony also confirmed the game is the last of the Norse mythology series. This took everyone by surprise, since the Greek mythology series had three mainline games. 
Now, in an interview with God of War YouTuber Kaptain Kuba, Santa Monica Studio&#x27;s creative director Cory Barlog explained the decision.
&quot;There are several reasons, I think one of the most important reasons is [time],&quot; Barlog said. &quot;The first game took five years. The second game, I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to take but I&#x27;m just going to throw out that it&#x27;s going to take close to a similar time, right, to do this.

                    <span>Sir Clive Sinclair, perhaps best known as the inventor of the enormously popular ZX Spectrum home computer, has died at the age of 81 following a long illness.
Although Sinclair found success creating a range of small calculators in the early 70s, it was the advent of his first, highly affordable mass-market computer in 1980, the ZX80 - which retailed for less than £100 - that helped make him a household name.
In 1982, the ZX80 and its successor the ZX81 were followed by one of Sinclair&#x27;s most influential products, the ZX Spectrum - a colour-capable home computer that, thanks to its popularity, played a key role in kickstarting the British software industry, leading to the creation of some of the era&#x27;s most iconic games, from Manic Miner, Chuckie Egg, and Jet Pac to Lords of Midnight, Knight Lore, and Horace Goes Skiing.

                    <span>Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, the latest entry in developer Frogwares&#x27; well-regarded deduction-based adventure series, now has a release date and will be coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, an PC on 16th November, with a PS4 and Xbox One release to follow.
Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, as its name suggests, serves as a prequel to Frogwares&#x27; previous Sherlock Holmes titles, taking players back to the detective&#x27;s days as a fresh-faced 21-year-old and the events that would lead to his life of sleuthing. It begins as Sherlock, with best friend Jon in tow, arrives on the sunny, Mediterranean-inspired island of Cordona - a significant aesthetic departure to the fog-shrouded London streets and rural corners of Frogwares&#x27; previous adventure - on the tenth anniversary of his mother&#x27;s death.
Frogwares has already shared some of the new and returning mechanics players can expect in this latest third-person, open-world investigation adventure, but the developer has now offered some additional information in a new 7-minute gameplay &quot;deep dive&quot; trailer.

                    <span>Following its majestic, Pirates of the Caribbean infused third season, Sea of Thieves will be embarking on a new adventure next Thursday, 23rd September, with the arrival of Season 4.
As to what&#x27;s in store this time around (beyond the inevitable fresh 100 levels of seasonal progression and rewards), Rare remains in a teasing mood, albeit dropping some major hints in Season 4&#x27;s newly revealed announcement trailer.
It appears the malevolant sirens - which got a long-awaited and wonderfully orchestrated introduction during Season 3&#x27;s A Pirate&#x27;s Life campaign - are poised to play an even bigger role. Last season&#x27;s spectacular Sunken Pearl Tall Tale took pirates down into the depths to visit the gorgeous coral-hewn home of the Siren Queen, and it seems we&#x27;ll be visiting more areas of the sirens&#x27; long-lost kingdom once Season 4 gets underway.

However, EA will use the preview packs it trialed towards the end of FIFA 21&#x27;s life.
In June, under increasing pressure from governments, children&#x27;s welfare groups and gambling charities, EA added the ability to see what&#x27;s inside FIFA 21 loot boxes before you buy them.

Details are scarce, as the rest of the listing is being deliberately obscured until Nintendo officially announces the product, or for up to 180 days (which would take us to March next year).

Arsen Shakhbabyan, an animator who helped make the controversial Aeon Must Die trailer that first premiered during last year&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play broadcast, had his attorney file the copyright claim after the trailer re-emerged on publisher Focus Home Interactive&#x27;s YouTube channel last month.
The trailer for the game shown during the August 2020 State of Play, below, depicts a visually arresting beat-&#x27;em-up that caught the attention of PlayStation fans.

Yes, this is an official WipEout game - at least in name, anyway. The debut trailer, below, clearly shows PlayStation&#x27;s trademark at the end. It will feature &quot;unique card-based racing&quot; and a single-player campaign.
WipEout Rush is developed by Rogue Games, a studio set up by former IGN journalist and co-founder Matt Casamassina. IGN has the exclusive on the game&#x27;s reveal today:

&quot;Spoiler alert: this game will eventually have an ending. There will be a definitive ending where you beat the game, just so people understand,&quot; artist Robin Eyre explained in a 30 minute fireside chat developer video.

                    <span>343 plans to ditch Halo: The Master Chief Collection&#x27;s seasons after Halo Infinite comes out, it&#x27;s signalled.
Season 8, which launches later this autumn, may prove to be MCC&#x27;s last season, as 343 moves away from the game&#x27;s season model to focus on smaller updates &quot;that can land when they&#x27;re ready based on development status and studio roadmap alignment&quot;.
343 insisted these updates will continue to be free and will include the unreleased features and content from this year, and it will make a continued effort to improve stability and tackle legacy fixes where possible. &quot;We still have a lot of goodness to deliver in 2022,&quot; 343&#x27;s publishing team lead producer Michael &quot;Farns&quot; Fahrny said in a post on Halo Waypoint.

                    <span>Following some uncertainty after Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s release date reveal last week and a subsequent blog post that stated one of the new campaign modes will require an online connection, Polyphony Digital has confirmed that an internet connection is necessary to play the game&#x27;s main campaign. 
The addition of a fully fleshed out campaign is one of the key new features in Gran Turismo 7, following its absence at the heart of the online-focussed Gran Turismo Sport. Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s campaign leans heavily on the series&#x27; past, allowing full modding and customisation of cars, as well as placing a fresh emphasis on the car collecting side with new and used dealerships and an all-new GT Cafe that lends some structure to the hoarding of cars. 
A blog post published in the immediate aftermath of the release date reveal stated that an online connection is required for GT Cafe, something series creator Kazunori Yamauchi was able to expand upon in a recent interview with Eurogamer.

The researchers note that in many cases, users can simply zoom in on the eyes of a person they suspect may not be real to spot the pupil irregularities. They also note that it would not be difficult to write software to spot such errors and for social media sites to use it to remove such content. Unfortunately, they also note that now that such irregularities have been identified, the people creating the fake pictures can simply add a feature to ensure the roundness of pupils.

And the arms race continues….

                    <span>Author: Chris Henzie (Google)
Last month&#x27;s release of Kubernetes v1.22 introduced a new ReadWriteOncePod access mode for PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.
With this alpha feature, Kubernetes allows you to restrict volume access to a single pod in the cluster.
What are access modes and why are they important?
When using storage, there are different ways to model how that storage is consumed.
For example, a storage system like a network file share can have many users all reading and writing data simultaneously.
In other cases maybe everyone is allowed to read data but not write it.
For highly sensitive data, maybe only one user is allowed to read and write data but nobody else.
In the world of Kubernetes, access modes are the way you can define how durable storage is consumed.

                    <span>After being compelled by a Swiss court to monitor IP logs for a particular user, ProtonMail no longer claims that “we do not keep any IP logs.”
EDITED TO ADD (9/14): This seems to be more complicated. ProtonMail is not yet saying that they keep logs. Their privacy policy still states that they do not keep logs except in certain circumstances, and outlines those circumstances. And ProtonMail’s warrant canary has an interesting list of data orders they have received from various authorities, whether they complied, and why or why not.

In distributed systems, it can be hard to figure out where problems are. You grep through one component&#x27;s logs just to discover that the source of your problem is in another component.  You search there only to discover that you need to enable debug logs to figure out what really went wrong... And it goes on. The more complex the path your request takes, the harder it is to answer questions about where it went.  I&#x27;ve personally spent many hours doing this dance with a variety of Kubernetes components. Distributed tracing is a tool which is designed to help in these situations, and the Kubernetes API Server is, perhaps, the most important Kubernetes component to be able to debug. At Kubernetes&#x27; Sig Instrumentation, our mission is to make it easier to understa…</span>
