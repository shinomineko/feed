&quot;We are aware that there are issues preventing the download of Sifu through the early access on the PlayStation Store, and are very sorry for the inconvenience,&quot; the development team explained via a tweet posted to the game&#x27;s official Twitter account earlier today. &quot;We&#x27;re looking into it with PlayStation to fix it asap, and will update you on the situation very soon!&quot;

                    <span>Co-op has finally arrived in Age of Empires 3.
Players can now band together to experience &quot;story-driven historical narratives and objectives&quot;, including all the same gameplay you know &quot;but tailored for the cooperative experiences&quot;, as well as fully-voiced dialogue and enemy AI that can take on two opponents instead of just one.

                    <span>Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks&#x27; action-horror title Ghostwire: Tokyo will reportedly take up just 20GB of space on your PC hard drive.
Surprised? Me, too. I spend a lot of time here reporting on new games taking up more and more space on our PCs and consoles, so it&#x27;s a thoroughly pleasant surprise to be able to report that despite its &quot;next-gen&quot; tag - Ghostwire: Tokyo is a timed PS5 console exclusive - Ghostwire demands comparatively very little space.

                    <span>Ubisoft has reportedly awarded the efforts of its Ghost Recon Breakpoint development team with an NFT Ghost Recon 20th anniversary cap.
After hosting a workshop held to assuage concerns about the company&#x27;s pivot to NFTs - non-fungible tokens recorded in blockchains - Ubisoft reportedly issued the tokens as a thank you for the Breakpoint team&#x27;s sustained efforts to improve the beleaguered shooter.

                    <span>A secret bike has been uncovered in Dying Light 2.
Thought to have found it by using NexusMods&#x27; developer menu on PC - although they&#x27;re being a tad coy about it, and won&#x27;t reveal how other players can get on their bikes too - Redditor Taki 7o7 shared their discovery online.

                    <span>Details of a new Batman collection - called Batman Arkham Collection, predictably enough - has popped up online.
Without confirmation from Warner Bros. we can only chalk this up as a rumour for now, but details of the bundle - reportedly coming to Switch for €60 at the end of August, although that could be a placeholder date - are online at French retailer, WTT.

                    <span>Nearly eight years into the Sims 4&#x27;s life and the DLC show no sign of slowing. Following the arrival of this week&#x27;s vibrant Carnaval Streetwear Kit, a new leak has seemingly revealed extensive details on the life sim&#x27;s previously teased new wedding-themed Game Pack.
Suspicions were raised that a new wedding-focussed pack was coming back in January, when EA teased its upcoming Sims 4 content plans for the first three months of 2022. That reveal promised a &quot;game pack that throws a party for love&quot;, and fans&#x27; immediate thoughts of wedding bells now appear to have been by confirmed by a series of leaks on Twitter.

                    <span>Google has reportedly &quot;deprioritised&quot; its consumer-facing game streaming platform Stadia and now has a &quot;reduced interest&quot; in negotiating blockbuster titles for the service, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services&#x27; underlying technology to third-parties.
Stadia&#x27;s misfortunes are well-documented; despite initial praise for the service&#x27;s streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia&#x27;s failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.

                    <span>Co-op platformer It Takes Two was widely praised by critics when it launched last March, even managing to secure a place in many an end-of-year best-of list in 2021; more than that, though, it&#x27;s continued to resonate with players, and developer Hazelight Studios has now announced the game has surpassed the five million sales mark across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
It Takes Two, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, follows the adventures of Cody and May, a human couple preparing to divorce, who are forced to work together after being turned into living dolls. In gameplay terms, that translates to a wonderfully inventive split-screen platformer where careful co-operation is key. And while Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchase had reservations about its story in his review, he was still charmed enough by its antics to call it &quot;a rare kind of co-op experience, with an energy and imagination and playfulness that sometimes rivals Nintendo&#x27;s.&quot;

                    <span>Dying Light 2: Stay Human has had a brilliant launch, with initial numbers on Steam passing 160,000 players.
The latest figures show that, even with a somewhat mixed bag of reviews, there is definitely enthusiasm for Techland&#x27;s zombie ridden, parkour powered brawl. On its launch, Dying Light 2 saw 160,202 concurrent players on Steam (via Benji Sales). To put this into perspective, that is 3.5 times that of Dying Light 1&#x27;s all-time peak, and 50 percent bigger than that of Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil Village.

                    <span>Saudi Arabia&#x27;s controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF) now has stakes in both Capcom and Nexon, making these two companies the latest in a long line of video game investments from the initiative chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The PIF purchased stakes of more than five percent in both Capcom and Nexon. This equates to a holding of more than $1bn across the two companies (via Bloomberg (paywall)). According to PIF, this move is based purely on an investment opportunity.

                    <span>New figures released by Activision Blizzard show another decline in its monthly active user numbers. In contrast, Square Enix has seen its numbers rise.
Across each division under the Activision Blizzard umbrella, there has been a fall in players. In December 2021, Activation saw its player count fall from 119m to 107m, while Blizzard&#x27;s numbers went from 26m to 24m. This follows a previous trend that saw the developer&#x27;s MAUs fall by 13 percent in November 2021.

                    <span>Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser should face 60 months - five years - behind bars, the US government has said.
The suggested sentence would be an extraordinary amount of jail time for Bowser, who has already admitted his guilt and accepted a $4.5m fine for his role in the production and sale of piracy-enabling game console devices.

A group of lawmakers led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have re-introduced the EARN IT Act, an incredibly unpopular bill from 2020 that was dropped in the face of overwhelming opposition. Let’s be clear: the new EARN IT Act would pave the way for a massive new surveillance system, run by private companies, that would roll back some of the most important privacy and security features in technology used by people around the globe. It’s a framework for private actors to scan every message sent online and report violations to law enforcement. And it might not stop there.

                    <span>Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s long-running Warcraft franchise will be making its way to mobile later this year, according to a newly released quarterly earnings report from Activision.
As things currently stand, there&#x27;s not a lot of information to go on, with Activision only saying that Blizzard is &quot;planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022&quot; that will see it deliver &quot;all-new mobile Warcraft content into players&#x27; hands for the first time&quot;. The project is highlighted separately from World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, both of which will also be getting &quot;new experiences&quot; this year, according to Activision.

                    <span>Despite having been some considerable time ago now, Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks&#x27; Ghostwire: Tokyo has remained a bit of a hard one to pin down, with previous gameplay trailers leaving more questions than answers. Now, however, with the game finally sporting a 25th March release date on PlayStation 5 and PC, Sony has offered an extended look at its action in a new livestream showcase.
Tango Gameworks is calling Ghostwire: Tokyo a &quot;supernatural action-adventure thriller&quot;, and its story unfolds in an eerie, haunted version of Tokyo after nearly all the city&#x27;s population has mysteriously vanished. Players take on the role of Akito, a young man who awakens in a deserted Tokyo street to discover that strange elemental powers are coursing through his veins - soon revealed to be the work of a spirit known as KK who has possessed Akito&#x27;s body.

Far Cry 6&#x27;s paid post-launch content has focused its aciton on some of the series&#x27; most infamous villains, and Ubisoft is capping off its previous two DLCs, Vaas: Insanity and Pagan: Control - which built adventures around Far Cry 3&#x27;s Vaas Montenegro and Far Cry 4&#x27;s Pagan Min - with a final outing centred on Far Cry 5&#x27;s Joseph Seed.

                    <span>Risk of Rain 2&#x27;s Survivors of the Void paid expansion finally has a launch date, and will be heading to PC on 1st March, with a console release to follow. And to celebrate the news, developer Hopoo Games has offered a closer look at the Railgunner - one of two new Survivors joining its enormously successful co-op rogue-like shooter sequel as part of the expansion.
Survivors of the Void brings a significant heft of new content to Risk of Rain 2 - ranging from new bosses and enemies to new items and stages - but the unifying theme (as its name does rather suggest) is The Void. The gateway to this mysterious realm has opened, spilling its innards all over Petrichor V. &quot;For millennia, The Void Creatures have grown dominant by taking artifacts from our realm to theirs,&quot; Hopoo explains. &quot;Now they look to add you to their collection.&quot;

Following on from the events of Horizon Zero Dawn, this sequel puts players back into the shoes of Aloy once more. Unfortunately for the outcast-turned-Nora-hero, however, it does not look as though there will be any time to sit back and relax. A deadly plague now appears to be ravishing the land, threatening life once more.

Psychonauts 2, the most recent game from Double Fine, was met with overwhelming praise on its release. Eurogamer&#x27;s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it &quot;witty, eccentric and imaginative&quot; during his review, noting it had a &quot;more developed understanding of mental health&quot; than its predecessor. More recently, the mix of hallucinogenic gameplay and emotional storytelling won Psychonauts 2 the Game of the Year accolade at the New York Game Awards. But even with this success, Double Fine&#x27;s founder Tim Schafer revealed that a movie adaptation of any of his games is not something he is interested in.

                    <span>The newly-released Bloodborne PSX demake has had an unbelievable debut, having been downloaded more than 100, 000 times in less than 24 hours.
The recent demake from Unreal Engine 4 tech artist and engineer Lilith Walthe saw Bloodborne going back to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 1 roots. Gone were the more realistic graphics of modern games, and in place fans were treated to a wonderful and pixelated nightmare. Eurogamer&#x27;s Ian Higton gave it a whirl, delighting in the demake&#x27;s ability to combine two of his favourite things - Retro games and spanking werewolves.

                    <span>Bungie wants to develop its franchises outside of gaming - and Sony looks set to help.

                    <span>Following on from Nintendo&#x27;s earnings report today, the company has disclosed that the Switch is only just in the &quot;middle of its lifecycle&quot;.
During Nintendo&#x27;s earning report, company president Shuntaro Furukawa said sales of the Nintendo Switch continue to grow and have already surpassed 100m units sold. While the rate of sales has slowed down over the last 12 months, something that has been attributed to the ongoing chip shortages that have also plagued PlayStation 5 sales, Furukawa is not concerned this is on ongoing trend.

Amongst the news, one small nugget spotted in Sony&#x27;s earnings report was how the company is going to allocate the $3.6bn it spent on acquiring Bungie.

The 30 minute presentation reestablished the line that this is a Gran Turismo game that&#x27;s returning to the series&#x27; roots, with a fresh focus on optimisation and the player&#x27;s journey from starting behind the wheel of a humble starter car after the more stripped-back, multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport.

                    <span>Following a smattering of leaks over the past few weeks, Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks&#x27; action-horror title Ghostwire: Tokyo has finally been given an official release date, and will be making its way to PlayStation 5 on 25th March.
Ghostwire: Tokyo got its first (and decidedly enigmatic) showing back at E3 2019; one year on, Tango Gameworks revealed the game to be some sort of action-focussed first-person horror experience unfolding on the rain-slicked streets of Tokyo, where players must energetically thrust their supernatural abilities at strikingly designed spirits known as The Visitors.

Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad, officially titled Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, was announced last August, with publisher Warner Bros confirming it to be an open-world co-op game (and a continuation of Rocksteady&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Universe) set within an open-world version of Metropolis, and designed for up to four players. It was initially slated for a PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X release some time this year.

                    <span>The pesky fridge door in Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy that never, ever, closes was inspired by long-running gags from Modern Family and Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia, its creative director has now revealed.
While many Marvel fans were likely spending their time hanging out with Groot and co while on board the Milano, others decided to take Star Lord even deeper into the inner workings of the ship. Here, they will have come across a broken fridge door, which in itself is fairly unremarkable. This door can be interacted with, and players can try and close it if they wish, but this would ultimately be to no avail. The fridge door will never remain closed, not matter how often one tries.

                    <span>The next game from Yacht Club Games, the developer famous for Shovel Knight, has been revealed: a brand-new project known as Mina The Hollower.
In a first for the company, the game has nothing to do with Shovel Knight. Rather, this time players will have the chance to take on the mantle of Mina, an adorable but lethal mouse. Don&#x27;t let their cute façade fool you though. Yacht Club has promised players a &quot;bone chilling&quot; experience.

                    <span>Steam&#x27;s current Lunar New Year sale might be nearing its end, but there&#x27;s plenty more on the horizon for discount hunters - as Valve has now revealed in its newly released schedule of Steam sales and events for the first half of 2022.
As far as Steam&#x27;s flagship events go, first in the queue is another Next Fest, promising to once again heap an impracticably sized avalanche of playable demos upon visitors from 21st-28th February. There&#x27;s a second Next Fest in June, and that&#x27;ll be followed by Steam&#x27;s next big discount event in the form of the Summer Sale, running from 23rd June to 7th July.

                    <span>With early retail copies of Dying Light 2 now out in the wild, developer Techland has asked fans who&#x27;ve received the game ahead of Friday&#x27;s official launch to hold off playing until then.
&quot;Fellow survivors,&quot; the developer wrote in a message on Twitter, &quot;we see that some of you got an access to the retail copies of Dying Light 2 before the release date... We understand you want to start exploring the City ASAP and we couldn&#x27;t be happier!&quot;.

                    <span>OlliOlli World, the ambitious new entry in Roll7&#x27;s acclaimed skateboarding series, is just a week away from release, and the developer is marking the final countdown to launch with news that Hollywood star Danny Trejo will be making an appearance in-game.
Trejo is certainly prolific, having featured in over 250 film and TV roles (including the likes of Machete and From Dusk Till Dawn), and his video game credits are steadily expanding too. His OlliOlli World cameo will be the actor&#x27;s second video game appearance in a little over two months, having been given a starring role in his own Far Cry 6&#x27;s DLC at the end of last year.

                    <span>There are two bills working their way through Congress that would force companies like Apple to allow competitive app stores. Apple hates this, since it would break its monopoly, and it’s making a variety of security arguments to bolster its argument. I have written a rebuttal:
I would like to address some of the unfounded security concerns raised about these bills. It’s simply not true that this legislation puts user privacy and security at risk. In fact, it’s fairer to say that this legislation puts those companies’ extractive business-models at risk. Their claims about risks to privacy and security are both false and disingenuous, and motivated by their own self-interest and not the public interest. App store monopolies cannot protect users from every risk, and they frequently prevent the distribution of important tools that actually enhance security. Furthermore, the alleged risks of third-party app stores and “side-loading” apps pale in comparison to their benefits. These bills will encourage competition, prevent monopolist extortion, and guarantee users a new right to digital self-determination...</span>

The show - which will retell the story of the Citadel space station and its rogue AI, SHODAN - is a collaboration between Nightdive Studios, which currently holds the System Shock license, and Binge.com, an &quot;immersive streaming platform created for the gaming universe&quot;.

                    <span>World War Z developer Saber Interactive has announced a second delay for its Evil Dead game, which will now launch for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on Friday, 13th May this year.
Saber&#x27;s Evil Dead game - a co-operative experience that brings together familiar faces from all across the Evil Dead franchise to battle the forces of Darkness - was initially expected to arrive in 2021. However, the developer made the decision to delay its release last August, pushing the game into February 2022 in order to implement a single-player option for those occasions when co-op companions aren&#x27;t readily to hand.

Never Yield - or rather, Aerial_Knight&#x27;s Never - is a 3D side-scroller in the vain of endless runner that sees players stampeding across a strikingly designed future Tokyo, all to a winning soundtrack created by Detroit Artist. Eurogamer never got around to reviewing this one, but Christian Donlan seemed quite taken with its rhythms a while back.

Maggie was, of course, confirmed as Season 12&#x27;s new hero earlier this week in her very own Stories from the Outlands animated introduction, and Respawn&#x27;s new launch trailer picks up pretty much right where that left off, with Maggie being flown into the Apex Games, as decreed during her trial. From there, it&#x27;s as chaotic as ever, with Maggie showing an unsuspecting solider what for, and, eventually, having a brief reunion with Fuse - who fans might recall was a long-time friend until a disagreement that left Fuse minus one arm.

                    <span>A German activist is trying to track down a secret government intelligence agency. One of her research techniques is to mail Apple AirTags to see where they actually end up:
Wittmann says that everyone she spoke to denied being part of this intelligence agency. But what she describes as a “good indicator,” would be if she could prove that the postal address for this “federal authority” actually leads to the intelligence service’s apparent offices.
“To understand where mail ends up,” she writes (in translation), “[you can do] a lot of manual research. Or you can simply send a small device that regularly transmits its current position (a so-called AirTag) and see where it lands.”...</span>

                    <span>Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut - the tarted up version of Hideo Kojima&#x27;s acclaimed damp hillside traipsing adventure - will be making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on 30th March, with a $10 upgrade offer for owners of the original.
Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut initially launched for PS5 last summer, introducing new story elements, a photo mode, expanded combat, new gadgets - including a laser gun and mounted machine guns - plus a variety of other tweaks to the original. Oh, and and it through in a fully featured racing mode too, because why not? The new PC version, incidentally, also features Xe Super Sampling and ultra-wide monitor support.

                    <span>AI: The Somnium Files - Nirvana Initiative, the sequel to publisher Spike Chunsoft&#x27;s acclaimed 2019 serial killer mystery AI: The Somnium Files, now has a release date, and will be launching for PC, Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on 24th June.
The original AI: The Somnium Files - which was the work of Zero Escape series creator and director Kotaro Uchikoshi - was a noir-ish murder mystery set in a technologically-advanced modern-day Tokyo. Nirvana Initiative, which once again sees Uchikoshi on scenario writing duties, retains the deductive premise of its predecessor but switches things up with a new pairing of protagonists and a new case to solve.

                    <span>A little over 18 months after launch, Ubisoft is calling time on Hyper Scape, its reasonably entertaining entry in the already well-represented free-to-play battle royale genre.
Hyper Scape made its debut in August 2020 after a short PC-only beta, where it was immediately met with a lukewarm reception - Eurogamer called it &quot;as smart as it is generic&quot;. Less than three month later, Ubisoft announced it was embarking on a major overhaul of its 100-player battle royale experience so it could reach its &quot;full potential&quot;.

                    <span>Following a bit of a delay at the end of last year, Steam Deck is almost upon us, with Valve now confirming its highly anticipated portable gaming PC will begin shipping on 28th February.
Given the manufacturing constraints that continue to dog the tech industry amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Valve will be disseminating Steam Deck - as it confirmed when its reservations system opened last July - in waves throughout 2022 and beyond.

                    <span>With February (you may better know it by its more common name, Elden Ring month) less than a week away, it&#x27;s time to do the subscription service additions dance once more. First up is PlayStation Plus, with Sony now confirming Planet Coaster, UFC 4, and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep as February&#x27;s library additions.
It&#x27;s a pleasingly eclectic bunch, that, starting with Frontier Developments&#x27; Planet Coaster, which joins PlayStation Plus for PlayStation 5 only. It&#x27;s a game that seeks to serve up a heap of classic theme park management action, but even speaking as a huge management sim fan that&#x27;s happy to hoover up anything the genre has to offer, Planet Coaster comes up disappointingly short if you&#x27;re looking for a tycoon game with mechanical depth and interesting strategic play. Where it shines, though, is in its immensely powerful creation tools, giving players everything they need to build some truly breathtaking parks and rides.

Joe Danger Touch and its sequel Joe Danger Infinity (which initially came to iOS in 2013 and 2014 respectively) both fell foul of Apple&#x27;s decision to end support for 32-bit apps with iOS11 back in 2017. However, over the last few years, Hello Games has, as detailed in its new announcement, been tinkering on the titles to get them playable again.

                    <span>KartKraft, the highly acclaimed sim that was so good Motorsport Games went and bought it all up and set up a new Australian studio for some of the team at original developer Black Delta, is finally leaving early access and having its full launch today. 
Having first hit Steam in 2018, Motorsport Games moved in on KartKraft last year, and the full release will see some 10 laser-scanned tracks, 20 kart manufacturers and plenty by way of mod support. It&#x27;s also one of the better racing experiences you can get in VR, so is worth a punt if you prefer your driving games a bit more immersive.

                    <span>Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto has admitted to disliking Navi, calling Ocarina of Time&#x27;s fairy companion the &quot;biggest weakpoint&quot; of the game.
The comments come from a 1999 interview with Miyamoto originally printed in a Japanese strategy guide and now published online.

BleepingComputer is aware of at least fifteen victims of the new DeadBolt ransomware attack, with no specific region being targeted.

                    <span>Call of Duty&#x27;s next three titles will reportedly still be making their way to PlayStation consoles, despite Microsoft&#x27;s recent acquisition of series publisher Activision Blizzard.
Following last week&#x27;s buyout news, many questions still remain - not least how Activision Blizzard&#x27;s current roster of multi-platform titles will be affected by the purchase, with many predicting that Xbox exclusivity might soon be on the cards for the publisher&#x27;s biggest franchises under Microsoft&#x27;s stewardship.

Johnson is, of course, no stranger to video game movies, having starred in an adaption of id Software&#x27;s first-person shooter Doom back in 2005 (by most accounts not an especially good movie) and more recently appearing in 2018&#x27;s live-action version of arcade favourite Rampage (see previous comment). And now Johnson has confirmed he&#x27;s poised to help bring another poor, unfortunate video game franchise kicking and screaming into cinemas.

The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that charted the story of young hero Twinsen, on the run from evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. A third instalment, set to conclude the saga, has long been discussed by the series&#x27; creators but has so-far never arrived.

The news comes as Activision Blizzard continues to reel from the shocking allegations it fostered a company culture where sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive, with Blizzard Entertainment itself being called a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; in a State of California lawsuit filed last year.

                    <span>With Apex Legends&#x27; 12th season coming in fast, developer Respawn Entertainment has officially unveiled the battle royale shooter&#x27;s next hero: Fuse&#x27;s one-time pal Mad Maggie.
Maggie first entered the realm of Apex Legends lore a little over a year ago today, as part of Season 8 newcomer Walter &#x27;Fuse&#x27; Fitzroy&#x27;s Stories from the Outlands animated introduction. Here, players saw the demolitions expert spending some quality time with Maggie, his childhood friend, until the pair had a disagreement that left him missing an arm.

                    <span>Acclaimed fantasy author (and huge From Software fan) Brandon Sanderson has teasingly decried Game of Thrones writer George R.R. Martin&#x27;s involvement in the upcoming Elden Ring.
Sanderson - whose expansive oeuvre includes the likes of the Mistborn saga and the final chapter in Robert Jordan&#x27;s Wheel of Time series - made the comments during a panel at 2021&#x27;s Dragonsteel MiniCon (as spotted by TechRadar), which has recently surfaced online.

                    <span>Rare will be outlining Sea of Thieves&#x27; &quot;biggest year yet&quot; during a special 2022 preview livestream airing this Thursday, 27th January.
This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve heard that phrase, of course; Sea of Thieves executive producer Joe Neate also teased the multiplayer pirate adventure&#x27;s &quot;biggest year yet&quot; ahead of 2021 - a claim that seems entirely reasonable in hindsight, given that last year saw Sea of Thieves introducing everything from a sizeable map expansion beneath the waves to a wildly cinematic Pirates of the Caribbean crossover. And that&#x27;s not even touching on the likes of new enemies, a new treasure burying mechanic, and more.

                    <span>A California court has permanently banned a Roblox player after he was sued by the game&#x27;s developer for allegedly harassing staff and making terrorist threats to disrupt official events.
The Roblox Corporation initially launched legal action against Roblox YouTuber and content creator Benjamin Robert Simon, known as Ruben Sim, last November, accusing him of leading a &quot;cybermob&quot; against the platform and using &quot;malice, fraud, and oppression&quot; to commit unlawful acts intended to &quot;injure Roblox and its users&quot;.

Making the announcement on Twitter, Ripple Effect Studios&#x27; Justin Weibe - who works as senior design director on the shooter&#x27;s latest instalment - says the plan is to &quot;fix it in the future&quot; and &quot;keep it in alignment with standard game progression&quot;, adding that to do so, the team has also &quot;tightened [its] review process&quot;.

                    <span>Halo Infinite players who lost XP during recent server outages are seemingly unlikely to have their rewards restored.
Confirmation came via a customer support representative who responded to a player&#x27;s queries about lost XP, the response for which was then shared on the game&#x27;s subreddit community.

                    <span>Another Apex Legends Wraith glitch has popped up, this time allowing players to draw their weapons and deal damage whilst the fan-favourite character is teleporting.
Ordinarily, Wraith cannot equip weapons in the void, let alone unleash upon suspecting opponents whilst essentially invisible, but players have discovered that they can take pop shots at enemies if they expertly pull off a nifty manoeuvre that uses both Wraith&#x27;s Dimensional Rift ultimate skill and her Into the Void tactical.

                    <span>Raven Software&#x27;s QA team has ended its strike action.
As Matt helpfully summarised for us a couple of days back, the strike began when around a third of the QA team was laid off back in December. The firings - coming after a five-week period of overtime and anticipated end-of-year crunch - occurred despite Activision allegedly promising the team it was working on a pay restructure to increase wages.

While console servers currently remained unaffected, it&#x27;s thought the same exploit may be possible via FromSoftware&#x27;s Elden Ring PC servers, too.

As its name suggests, Humankind&#x27;s Endless mod takes its cue from Amplitude&#x27;s long-running series of Endless games, which to date include Dungeon of the Endless, Endless Space and its sequel, and Endless Legends - not to mention a huge number of accompanying expansions.

                    <span>Quality assurance testers at Activision Blizzard&#x27;s Wisconsin-based Raven Software studio - where strike action has been ongoing since December, following the firing of 12 members of the developer&#x27;s QA team - have announced their intention to form a worker&#x27;s union.
The instigating incident - which came amid an already troublesome time for Activision Blizzard management, who had been repeatedly criticised following the California state lawsuit calling the publisher a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - took place in December when around a third of the QA team was laid off. The firings, coming after a five-week period of overtime and anticipated end-of-year crunch, occurred despite Activision allegedly promising the team it was working on a pay restructure to increase wages.

Details of the idea, originally dreamed up by Assassin&#x27;s Creed co-creator Patrice Désilets, have been published by Lars de Wildt, a researcher of conspiracy theories, religion and other beliefs in digital media culture at Belgian research university KU Leuven.

                    <span>China is mandating that athletes download and use a health and travel app when they attend the Winter Olympics next month. Citizen Lab examined the app and found it riddled with security holes.
Key Findings:
MY2022, an app mandated for use by all attendees of the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing, has a simple but devastating flaw where encryption protecting users’ voice audio and file transfers can be trivially sidestepped. Health customs forms which transmit passport details, demographic information, and medical and travel history are also vulnerable. Server responses can also be spoofed, allowing an attacker to display fake instructions to users.

                    <span>PC players with a hankering for some big stompy robot action are in luck; mech shooter Daemon X Machina has been confirmed as next week&#x27;s free Epic Games Store game.
Daemon X Machina, which originally released as a Switch exclusive back in 2019 before making its way to PC the following year, casts players in the role of mercenaries employed by the Orbital organisation. Crucially, these particular mercenaries have access to huge Arsenal mechs, and each successive missions sees players sliding and zooming across vibrantly hued post-apocalyptic arenas blasting the bolts off enormous robot enemies driven by corrupted AIs.

In the aftermath of Microsoft&#x27;s takeover news, many questions remained, not least regarding how the deal would impact platform exclusivity for all of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s currently multi-platform titles, including the likes of Overwatch and Call of Duty.

Valve first discussed its Steam Deck Verified initiative back in October, announcing it had started reviewing the entire Steam catalogue to create a new compatibility ratings system - labelling games as either Verified, Playable, Unsupported, and Unknown - that would provide Steam Deck users with a simple means of checking how games will function on their system.

                    <span>Last summer, the San Francisco police illegally used surveillance cameras at the George Floyd protests. The EFF is suing the police:
This surveillance invaded the privacy of protesters, targeted people of color, and chills and deters participation and organizing for future protests. The SFPD also violated San Francisco’s new Surveillance Technology Ordinance. It prohibits city agencies like the SFPD from acquiring, borrowing, or using surveillance technology, without prior approval from the city’s Board of Supervisors, following an open process that includes public participation.

Admission control is a key part of Kubernetes security, alongside authentication and authorization. Webhook admission controllers are extensively used to help improve the security of Kubernetes clusters in a variety of ways including restricting the privileges of workloads and ensuring that images deployed to the cluster meet organization’s security requirements.

To help admission controller users and designers manage these risks appropriately, the security documentation subgroup of SIG Security has spent some time developing a threat model f…</span>

Dying Light 2 on Switch was initially due to launch alongside the Xbox, PlayStation, and PC versions on 4th February - albeit in cloud-only form - but Techland has now confirmed prospective purchasers on the platform could be looking at a significant delay, saying it expects the game to release for Switch &quot;within six months from the original date&quot;.

                    <span>The ABK Workers Alliance - a group of Activision Blizzard employees that has continued to push for major workplace reforms following last year&#x27;s shocking reports detailing a culture of alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - has responded to today&#x27;s news that Microsoft is buying the publisher, saying that while the move is &quot;surprising&quot;, it does not change the group&#x27;s goals.
The ABK Workers Alliance was established last summer, in response to a State of California lawsuit calling Activision Blizzard a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;. Since then, the group has continued its mission to push for change at the publisher, launching a bid for unionisation, setting up a Strike Fund for employees, and calling for the removal (alongside the 1,800 employees that signed a related petition) of controversial CEO Bobby Kotick - who was said to have been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company &quot;for years&quot; in a damning Wall Street Journal report released in November.

                    <span>Following today&#x27;s bombshell announcement that Microsoft is purchasing Activision Blizzard for $70BN, many questions still remain, not least regarding how the deal will impact platform exclusivity for the third-party publisher&#x27;s previously multi-platform titles - and it&#x27;s something Xbox head Phil Spencer has started to address, albeit in the vaguest of terms, as he continues his post-announcement PR rounds.
It&#x27;s a topic that was touched upon in the briefest of manners in Microsoft&#x27;s original press release announcing the deal, with the company stating, &quot;Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward.&quot;

Wordle, the new one that is, has taken the world by storm in recent months, with users returning to play the word-based head scratcher day after day. Despite its success, creator Josh Wardle has pledged to keep his game browser-based and ad-free - a decision that&#x27;s lead to plenty of unscrupulous sorts cloning the game to turn a quick profit on mobile app stores.

&quot;I don&#x27;t mean it to sound like we&#x27;ve got it all figured out [at Xbox]&quot;, Spencer told IGN when quizzed on the recent reports involving Sony, &quot;but I think the right answer is allowing your customers to play the games they want to play, where they want to play them, and giving them choice about how they build their library, and being transparent with them about what our plans are in terms of our PC initiatives and our cross-gen initiatives and other things.&quot;

According to the Twitter account of TechnikNews, Rey Mysterio will allegedly grace this year&#x27;s cover. The site also intimates that pre-orders will go live &quot;soon&quot;, but stopped short of providing a definitive date - although we already knew that it&#x27;ll be sometime in March.

The news comes almost a year to the day after Warner Bros. Games delayed Hogwarts Legacy from 2021 to 2022, stating at the time that &quot;creating the best possible experience for all of the Wizarding World and gaming fans is paramount to us so we are giving the game the time it needs&quot;.

                    <span>Asmosdee&#x27;s digital board game, Pandemic, has been quietly withdrawn from sale &quot;for a multitude of reasons that [the publisher] cannot disclose&quot;.
Without formal announcement, Pandemic was delisted from Steam on 6th January, and it looks as though players can&#x27;t pick it up on mobile devices now, either (although if you already own the game, you should be able to re-download it again from your library if you&#x27;re quick). All signs of the game have been scrubbed from the company&#x27;s website, too.

Right now, if your character dies and/or is left behind after the mission timer expires, you&#x27;ll lose them, their blueprints, and their XP for good - a problem further compounded by server issues around the time the game launched last month, and an acknowledgement that some players may have not realised how death worked in the session-based survival game.

Up until now, PS3 games on the PS Store would typically redirect you to Sony&#x27;s on-demand streaming service, PlayStation Now - which is, in fact, what happened when I checked the store myself this morning when preparing this story.

According to SteamDB, the concurrent player count continues to climb since the game was released yesterday and at the time of writing, the record stands at 57,764 simultaneous players - not bad for an entirely single-player experience. In fact, in the 20 minutes since I started writing this article, the concurrent peak has increased four - no, wait, five now - times.

                    <span>Today sees the launch of God of War on PC - arguably the biggest PlayStation franchise to make the leap from console so far - and in a new interview published to coincide with its release, Sony Santa Monica creative director Cory Barlog has revealed it was Sony&#x27;s own internal studios that pushed to get PlayStation games on PC.
Asked if Sony&#x27;s decision to begin porting its games to the platform was something championed by the Santa Monica team early on, Barlog, in conversation with GameInformer, suggested it was actually the developers across Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Studios network that were ultimately instrumental in convincing the company to make the move to PC.

Many would argue it was the original Dying Light&#x27;s extensive programme of post-launch content that proved the greatest contributor to its enormous success - Techland is still supporting the game with a mixture of paid and free content some seven years after its initial release - and the studio looks set to follow the same long-tail formula for its imminent sequel.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment is currently working on a single-player first-person shooter with a focus on mobility and style, according to a new report - but before irreversible excitement takes hold, it&#x27;s claimed the project won&#x27;t be a Titanfall sequel.
The report follows Respawn creative director Mohammad Alavi&#x27;s recent announcement he&#x27;s departing the studio after 11 year to pursue his &quot;next adventure&quot;. Alavi leading development of a &quot;brand new single-player adventure&quot; at the company, first mentioned in a job listing posted last year, and news of his departure prompted some to ponder the fate of the project.

                    <span>So far, Sega&#x27;s had something of a rollercoaster relationship with NFTs, bursting forth fully enthused last summer before seemingly reining that excitement in more recently. However, its corporate machinations continue behind the scenes and new trademark registrations and logos have emerged revealing Sega&#x27;s new gambit to potentially be called Sega NFT.
Sega first shared its interest in joining the NFT and blockchain throng last April, when it revealed it had partnered with Japanese company Double Jump Tokyo to begin selling the likes of visual art, in-game images, and background music based on its new and classic IPs in NFT form. It then repeated its enthusiastic stance as part of an investor briefing in November.

                    <span>Following a delay at the end of 2021, Valve has confirmed its highly anticipated portable gaming PC Steam Deck is still on track to meet its revised February 2022 launch date.
When Steam Deck reservations first opened in July last year, Valve anticipated its hardware to begin shipping before the end of the year. Unfortunately, disruptions in production caused by a lack of available parts crushed those pre-Christmas dreams and Valve adjusted its planning, telling customers it expected first Steam Deck units to release in February this year.

The researchers from the FAS Center for Systems Biology discovered a network of genes important in squid eye development that are known to also play a crucial role in limb development across animals, including vertebrates and insects. The scientists say these genes have been repurposed in squid to make camera-lens-type eyes.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>I don’t even know what I think about this. Researchers have developed a malware detection system that uses EM waves: “Obfuscation Revealed: Leveraging Electromagnetic Signals for Obfuscated Malware Classification.”
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is constituted of devices that are exponentially growing in number and in complexity. They use numerous customized firmware and hardware, without taking into consideration security issues, which make them a target for cybercriminals, especially malware authors.
We will present a novel approach of using side channel information to identify the kinds of threats that are targeting the device. Using our approach, a malware analyst is able to obtain precise knowledge about malware type and identity, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques which may prevent static or symbolic binary analysis. We recorded 100,000 measurement traces from an IoT device infected by various in-the-wild malware samples and realistic benign activity. Our method does not require any modification on the target device. Thus, it can be deployed independently from the resources available without any overhead. Moreover, our approach has the advantage that it can hardly be detected and evaded by the malware authors. In our experiments, we were able to predict three generic malware types (and one benign class) with an accuracy of 99.82%. Even more, our results show that we are able to classify altered malware samples with unseen obfuscation techniques during the training phase, and to determine what kind of obfuscations were applied to the binary, which makes our approach particularly useful for malware analysts...</span>

Specifically, Krafton (thanks TechCrunch) is targeting the continued availability of Garena&#x27;s Free Fire games - which it calls &quot;thinly veiled unauthorised versions of Battlegrounds&quot; - with the original Free Fire having already been the recipient of a legal challenge by the PUBG developer.

                    <span>Love them or hate them, lockpicking is perhaps the greatest staple minigame developers turn to when needing to mix up gameplay or just extend the length of a game.
Now a single game, well more of a museum, collates all those minigames into one big game.

                    <span>With only a couple of months to go until the launch of Gran Turismo 7 - be still my heart that beats like a piston - Polyphony Digital is revealing some more of what to expect, including a return of an iconic circuit last seen in 2013&#x27;s Gran Turismo 6. Which is to say that Daytona International Speedway is back.
You might know the circuit from its slightly fanciful appearance in Sega&#x27;s Daytona USA, and while that game remains an all-time great I regret to inform you that the real thing isn&#x27;t overlooked by a cliff with Sonic etched into its face, nor is there a playable slot machine on the bridge over the back straight. But!

                    <span>Remember when the US and Australian police surreptitiously owned and operated the encrypted cell phone app ANOM? They arrested 800 people in 2021 based on that operation.
New documents received by Motherboard show that over 100 of those phones were shipped to users in the US, far more than previously believed.
What’s most interesting to me about this new information is how the US used the Australians to get around domestic spying laws:

                    <span>PUBG: Battlegrounds is now free-to-play, and the gambit appears to be going well so far, with the popular battle royale shooter having peaked at 669k concurrent players on Steam earlier today, meaning it came close to doubling December&#x27;s figures.
As noted by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter, PUBG saw its concurrent peak player count climb to 668,707 on Steam following its shift to free-to-play earlier today, beating its previous two month highs by more than 300k players.

                    <span>Sony has reportedly told UK retailers they can no longer sell PlayStation Now cards - which can be used to purchase fixed subscription periods for the company&#x27;s games streaming and download service - in stores from 21st January, amid persistent claims it&#x27;s readying to launch an expanded version of PlayStation Plus.
That&#x27;s according to a new report by VentureBeat&#x27;s Jeff Grub, who shares a recent email circulated to store staff by senior management at UK retailer Game as an example of the move. &quot;Stores have until the close of day Wednesday 19, January to remove all POS and ESD cards from all customer-facing areas and update their digital bays in line with this week&#x27;s upcoming commercial update&quot;, the message reads.

                    <span>Following reports earlier this week that Lucid Games, the UK developer behind Destruction All-Stars, was no longer working on a new Twisted Metal game for Sony as previously claimed, a new report has suggested it&#x27;s now being handled by first-party PlayStation studio Firesprite Games, which only recently saw the director of MotorStorm join its ranks.
Word of a new entry in the Twisted Metal series first emerged last September, when GamesBeat journalist Jeff Grubb claimed the project was in early development. Shortly after, reports suggested Destruction All-Stars developer Lucid Games had landed the gig and that this latest instalment would be turning the car combat series into a free-to-play game.

                    <span>A listing for an Xbox version of Shadow Man: Remastered, Nightdive Studios&#x27; enhanced version of Acclaim&#x27;s much-loved 1999 action-adventure, has appeared on the Microsoft Store, suggesting it&#x27;ll arrive alongside the previously announced PlayStation version later this week.
Shadow Man - which was based on Valiant Comics&#x27; Shadowman series and originally released for N64, PSone, Dreamcast, and PC back in 1999 - charts the adventures of Michael LeRoi, the latest in a line of voodoo warriors all adopting the Shadow Man moniker. The fondly remembered video game adaptation reimagines the comic book character&#x27;s battle against the forces of darkness as a blend of third-person platforming, puzzling, and combat, playing out across both the real world and its terrifying counterpart, Deadside.

                    <span>2021 might not have been a banner year for video games (although it was certainly no slouch), but video games there were, and many were sold. To celebrate that fact, Sony has now offered up its own list of last year&#x27;s most popular games, as per the greatest number of downloads on its PlayStation Store - and of no huge surprise, FIFA 22 is at number one here in Europe.
Sony&#x27;s official list is actually four lists spanning four different categories - the top paid PlayStation 5, PS4, and PSVR games, plus the biggest free-to-play games - and those are separated out again across two different territories: Europe and the US/Canada.

                    <span>I’ve been giving Azure a fair bit of grief lately for some embarrassing information security lapses, and I think it’s only fair for me to explain in a format beyond “some tweets” exactly why that is. The write-ups I’ve seen have all been deeply technical and more or less bury the lede, so let me […]

                    <span>Researchers have figured how how to intercept and fake an iPhone reboot:
We’ll dissect the iOS system and show how it’s possible to alter a shutdown event, tricking a user that got infected into thinking that the phone has been powered off, but in fact, it’s still running. The “NoReboot” approach simulates a real shutdown. The user cannot feel a difference between a real shutdown and a “fake shutdown.” There is no user-interface or any button feedback until the user turns the phone back “on.”

It’s a complicated hack, but it works.

                    <span>As 2021 drew to a close, the long-running Yogcast Jingle Jam charity bundle event returned for its latest instalment, this time taking the form of a truly spectacular 56-game bundle - and organisers have now confirmed the endeavour raised a total of £3.3m for good causes.
2021&#x27;s bundle was impressive enough from a content perspective, gathering up the likes Eurogamer&#x27;s Essential-rated Widermyth, linguistics adventure Heaven&#x27;s Vault, Viking strategy Northguard, top-down action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter, plus Surviving Mars, Murder by Numbers, 20XX, and a load more. It was absolutely unmissable from a value perspective, however, amounting to around £650 worth of games for anyone that donated £35 or more.

                    <span>Duncan Jones, who directed 2009&#x27;s critically acclaimed sci-fi movie Moon and 2016&#x27;s considerably less critically acclaimed Warcraft adaptation, has reminded everyone he&#x27;d still very much like to make a Full Throttle movie, and if you could pester Disney that would be great.
Jones&#x27; affinity with Full Throttle - developer LucasArt&#x27;s 1995 point-and-click biker gang classic, written by the legendary Tim Schafer - is, of course, pretty well-known by this point. &quot;It blew my mind! I LOVED that game,&quot; he wrote in a tweet at the start of last year, &quot;I mean, REALLY loved that game.&quot; And he wasn&#x27;t joking, either.

                    <span>Lego has announced it is indefinitely suspending the release of its Overwatch 2 Titan set, initially scheduled to launch on 1st February, in light of ongoing concerns related to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s workplace culture - which was described as a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; in a California State lawsuit launched last July.
The controversy surrounding Activision Blizzard has only deepened since then; November saw the release of a damning Wall Street Journal report detailing further alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - with the publication levying particular criticism at CEO Bobby Kotick, claiming he&#x27;d been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across the company &quot;for years&quot;.

Good day, everyone 👋
Welcome to the first episode of the APAC edition of the &quot;Meet Our Contributors&quot; blog post series.
In this post, we&#x27;ll introduce you to five amazing folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers of numerous community initiatives.

                    <span>Over the weekend, developer Techland attempted to stir up some additional excitement for the impending arrival of its parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel Dying Light 2 by claiming players would likely need to set aside &quot;at least 500 hours&quot; to fully complete the game. The statement perhaps didn&#x27;t have quite the desired effect, however, drawing ire from skeptical fans, and the company has now offered further clarification, saying the game should only take around 20 hours to beat at its most fundamental level.
Techland initially made its 500-hour completion claim in a post to Twitter on Saturday, and following a less-than-stellar response to the news - some fans called the extended playtime off-putting - Techland attempted to allay concerns by clarifying the figure only applied when completing all the quests, endings, and exploring every part of the world. Regular players, it said, should &quot;finish the story + side quests... in less than 100 hours&quot;.

Well, today is not the day to find out as the publisher has announced Cities: Skylines&#x27; upcoming Airports expansion - which comes to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 25th January - will be accompanied by a four-strong batch of supporting paid DLC.
Up first is a new Content Creator Map Pack, costing £3.99/€4.99/$4.99 USD and introducing eight new terrain maps created by Sanctum Gamer - as featured in the announcement trailer.

                    <span>Following a few vague teases (and some decidedly more specific teases) that Sam &quot;Serious&quot; Stone was prepping to return for another bout of explosive FPS action in the near future, publisher Devolver Digital has finally revealed all. A new standalone expansion for Serious Sam 4, titled Siberian Mayhem, comes to Steam on 25th January.
Siberian Mayhem, as you might already have deduced, sees Sam trading the comparatively sun-drenched climes of Serious Sam 4 for some chillier action as he journeys across the Russian wilderness in search of the traitorous General Brand - an adventure featuring five &quot;massive&quot; new missions across Arctic coastlines, desolate forests, abandoned villages, and a ghost town.

                    <span>Lucid Games, the UK developer behind Destruction All-Stars, is reportedly no longer working on a new Twisted Metal game for Sony as previously claimed, with the project now said to have been handed over to an unnamed first-party studio.
Word of a new Twisted Metal game first surfaced last September, when GamesBeat journalist Jeff Grubb claimed the project was in early development. Shortly after, VGC offered additional details, reporting Lucid Games would be the studio handling the new instalment and that the project would follow Destruction All-Stars lead as a free-to-play game.

For now, though, you can gaze below at roughly a minute&#x27;s worth of footage showing the project in action. It&#x27;s being worked upon by sultim_t, who previously put together a Serious Sam 1 ray-tracing mod, and is based on another previous attempt at Half-Life ray-tracing.

From Software&#x27;s hotly-anticipated action RPG - for which Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin has contributed to the world-building - surpassed Techland&#x27;s Dying Light 2: Stay Human earlier this week to secure the top spot as Steam&#x27;s most-wanted game.

Established in 1998 - that&#x27;s 24 years ago and yes, thanks, that does make me feel very, very old - the Independent Games Festival was established to &quot;encourage innovation in game development and to recognise the best independent game developers&quot;, kind of like a Sundance for indie games.

Making the announcement in a new year round-up, developer Facepunch revealed that as well as selling 12,481,079 copies of the game, it&#x27;s also sold over one million DLC packs - a surprisingly modest number, given the number of people invested in the vanilla game, perhaps? - and has over 400,000 users on its Discord server.

                    <span>Gary McKay has written candidly about his first year as general manager at BioWare, describing how the studio continues to adapt during the coronavirus pandemic, and how it intends to &quot;rebuild [its] reputation&quot; following the cancellation of its live-service shooter, Anthem.
&quot;This has been another challenging year, with both work and home life continuing to be disrupted by the uncertainty of the global pandemic,&quot; McKay wrote in a blog on the official BioWare website. &quot;We&#x27;ve had to continue to think on our feet to adapt to changing circumstances.

                    <span>Remember that brief Serious Sam teaser that had fans thinking a new instalment - or, in the very least, new DLC - might be on the way? Turns out they were right, and a new Serious Sam is set to release later this month.
