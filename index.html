                              <span>Steve Gaynor, the controversial co-founder of Gone Home and Tacoma developer Fullbright, is now going it alone under the Fullbright name following accusations of toxic workplace behaviour in August 2021.


Gaynor made headlines at the time after an exodus of 15 staff at Fullbright was, in part, blamed on his behaviour towards fellow workers. An investigation by Polygon claimed Gaynor was &quot;controlling&quot;, and that staff, particularly women, frequently felt &quot;undermined and demeaned&quot;, disparaged and discredited.


Soon after, Gaynor publicly acknowledged his &quot;leadership style was hurtful to people that worked at Fullbright&quot;, and announced he would be stepping back from the day-to-day development of the studio&#x27;s latest game, Open Roads. A separate statement from Fullbright confirmed Gaynor would also be vacating his role as the studio&#x27;s creative lead and manager.

                              <span>Developer Frictional Games has announced another short delay for its intriguing &quot;unscripted&quot; WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker, but it&#x27;s also releasing a little something to tide fans over between now and its new 6th June arrival date in the form of a demo soon coming to Steam.


Amnesia: The Bunker - the fourth game in the Amnesia series, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and Rebirth - has seen a number of delays this year as Frictional puts the finishing touches to the experience, and the developer has now made the decision to push its release back another two weeks, from 23rd May to 6th June.


In a short statement announcing the news, Frictional attributed the latest delay to &quot;unforeseen certification issues&quot;. The decision, it said, was &quot;crucial to ensure we do not ship the game with these issues&quot;, adding the extra time afforded by the delay will allow it to &quot;rectify the problem and ensure the best possible gameplay experience on release&quot;.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom officially launched today, and the race to speedrun the game as quickly as possible has already begun. 


An eye-catching run from YouTuber gymnast86, posted this morning, shows the game beaten in just 94 minutes. This is an any% speedrun with no assists from amiibo.


What&#x27;s interesting here is nearly half of the run covers the game&#x27;s opening portion without any major shortcuts. Even with knowledge of where to go and how to do it, this takes over 40 minutes.

                              <span>In case you weren&#x27;t aware, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released today. Along with the sequel&#x27;s new-look Hyrule, Link also has a range of new abilities that can help him on his journey to once again rid the kingdom of the many evils that have made their home there. 


One such ability is Ascend, which allows Link to pass through solid objects above him. This is a game changer when it comes to traversal, as Link no longer has to necessarily negotiate the weather and his stamina to make his way up cliffs and the like. Now, he can find some kind of overhang and pop up and through to create seemingly impossible shortcuts. 


However, this useful new ability wasn&#x27;t always going to make it into Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s final release. In fact, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma and game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi revealed it actually started off as a debug cheat function not intended for the game.

                              <span>Titan, one of Destiny 2&#x27;s original selection of locations, looks set to make a return to the game. 


The ocean moon of Saturn was cruelly cut from Destiny 2 alongside several other destinations back in 2020, as developer Bungie sought to trim the amount of content it had to keep up to date. It was an unpopular decision, and one it has now ceased.


Some of that content has since been re-added, with Titan looking set to make a reappearance in the upcoming Season of the Deep. Here&#x27;s a quick teaser:

                              <span>My copy of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is currently &quot;out for delivery&quot;, and expected to arrive sometime this afternoon. It is now afternoon, and there&#x27;s still no sign of it. To save myself from twiddling my thumbs while staring mindlessly at the wall, I decided to check out Flappy Souls.

Flappy Souls is a new, free release on Steam. It is marketed as being &quot;a mix of Flappy Bird and Dark Souls&quot;, hence the name. The premise is remarkably simple - you have to fly around as a baseball cap-wearing bird while dodging obstacles. Smattered through these obstacles are souls that you have to collect, and as you progress you level up. And that&#x27;s it. Easy, right? No, not right. This game is HARD! 


Now, before I get too into it, let me ask - are you the kind of person who ducks a little when you go under a low bridge in a car? I am. For some reason, I have it hardwired into my brain that physically ducking will somehow ensure safer passage. Logically, of course, I know it makes absolutely no sense. If my car isn&#x27;t going to fit, me ducking, or breathing in when I pass another vehicle on a slightly narrower stretch of road, isn&#x27;t going to change that. And yet, I still do it.

                              <span>The unannounced Mortal Kombat 1 will reportedly get Peacemaker and Homelander as DLC characters.

Windows Central reports the two characters are part of the Mortal Kombat 1 character pass.


Peacemaker is a DC comics anti-hero made mainstream by his appearance in James Gunn&#x27;s 2021 Suicide Squad movie and HBO Peacemaker spin-off TV series. The character is played by pro wrestler and actor John Cena.

                              <span>Hot off the heels of his turn as Bowser in the Super Mario Bros. Movie, Jack Black has given his likeness to a host of other video game characters, and the results are everything I could have wanted and more. 


This eclectic menagerie of characters all come from Tenacious D&#x27;s latest music video, for a song aptly named &quot;Video Games&quot;. Animated versions of Black and Kyle Gass begin the promo in a fairly normal way. The duo are in a studio, with Black singing into his mic while Gass strums on his animated guitar. Soon, however, things become chaoticly brilliant.


It starts with Gass getting squashed by God of War&#x27;s Dauði Kaupmaðr, and Black fleeing the scene only to find himself in the middle of Fallout 4 (as one does). The rest of the video then sees the duo becoming Sonic and Tails, Red Dead cowboys and more. As I have said, it is brilliant, as you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>It may be Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launch day, but Nintendo is already thinking about the future - and the possibility of a Legend of Zelda game where Zelda could finally be the star.


Fans have long called for Zelda to take on more of an active role in the series she gives her name to. And more recently, Zelda has indeed been playable in spin-offs such as Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Age of Calamity.


But the main Zelda series has remained steadfast at always casting Link as the hero, and Zelda herself as someone kept largely off-screen. (And that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ll say here, where there shall be no Tears of the Kingdom spoilers.)

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Call of Duty is Modern Warfare 3 and is due out 10th November on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, according to a report by Insider Gaming.


The game is pitched as a &quot;fully-fledged sequel&quot; to last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2, with development led by Vanguard maker Sledgehammer Games and support provided by Activision&#x27;s many Call of Duty studios.


Apparently all the modes you&#x27;d expect from a full-blown Call of Duty game are included, such as campaign, multiplayer and zombies (&quot;essentially an Outbreak 2.0&quot; that may or may not be free-to-play). There&#x27;s a new Warzone 2 map planned for later in the year based on the Las Almas map from the Modern Warfare 2 campaign.

The showrunners were making casting preparations for The Last of Us&#x27; second season up until earlier this week, when it was put on hold, Variety reports.


According to sources familiar with the matter, up until this point the casting team had been asking actors to read sides taken &quot;directly&quot; from The Last of Us Part 2, PlayStation&#x27;s 2020 release that the second season will be based on, during auditions, as there are currently no scripts for the show itself.

Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said Switch will remain at its current price point despite entering its seventh year on sale, due to inflation and foreign exchange rates. 


As for the potential of a price rise - as Sony did for PlayStation 5 last summer - Nintendo did not entirely rule it out.

Bloober&#x27;s updated version of Layers of Fear, which was initially announced under the name Layers of Fears, is being co-developed with Anshar Studios. It sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 all rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and reimagined as a single, generations-spanning &quot;psychedelic horror chronicle&quot;.


Both previously released games - which respectively chart the gradual unravellings of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece and a legendary actor making one final movie on a labyrinthine ocean liner - get some striking new visuals in the reboot, alongside new gameplay and expanded plot lines. And there&#x27;s a new framing device tying the whole lot together, focusing on a new lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.

Project Sirius - a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience being developed by The Flame and the Flood studio Molasses Flood - was announced last October as part of CD Projekt&#x27;s ambitious studio roadmap, which included a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, a new IP, the next Witcher trilogy, and a remake of the first Witcher game.


However, March brought the news work on Project Sirius had stalled after CD Projekt had re-evaluated the &quot;scope and commercial potential of the original concept&quot;. At the time, the company told investors it was in the process of &quot;formulating a new framework&quot; for the game that was better &quot;aligned with [its] strategy&quot;.

                              <span>We&#x27;re less than a month away from the start of this year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest &quot;season&quot; and host Geoff Keighley is starting to crank the hype handle, revealing this year&#x27;s event will feature &quot;updates from 40+ partners&quot; including PlayStation and Xbox.


Summer Game Fest officially begins on 8th June with a live showcase promising a mix of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements, but it&#x27;ll continue on well after that, with various other industry events and showcases - including those previously announced by Xbox and Ubisoft - set to fall under the Summer Game Fest banner throughout the season.


That&#x27;s about as much detail as we&#x27;d heard previously, but the official Summer Game Fest Twitter account has now revealed a sizeable list of game companies confirmed to be taking part in some capacity, including big names like PlayStation, Xbox, Capcom, Sega, CD Projekt, Bandai Namco, EA, Epic Games, Netflix, Activision, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros.

                              <span>Asus has announced final details for the Asus ROG Ally, its Steam-Deck-style handheld gaming PC, confirming the device will launch on 13th June priced at £699/$699 USD.


We first caught a glimpse of the ROG Ally on 1st April this year, but Asus was quick to confirm the device was not, in fact, a weirdly elaborate April Fool&#x27;s Day prank, but rather an actual real thing it was planning to release.


A few weeks later, Asus was ready to talk specs, confirming the ROG Ally would include an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor, a seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen, a UHS-2 Micro SD card slot, plus Windows 11 support, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It also promised &quot;up to&quot; 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode and storage of &quot;up to&quot; 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD, although it offered little word on other planned configurations.

                              <span>Goodbye Volcano High, the &quot;hybrid cinematic narrative/rhythm game/coming of age/interactive movie experience&quot; from developer KO_OP has been delayed again, this time by two and a half months to 29th August.


Announced back in 2020, Goodbye Volcano High - which follows the adventures of a group of teen dinosaurs as they learn to live and love in a world teetering on the bring of destruction - was originally expected to launch in 2021, but a narrative reboot and the global pandemic saw KO_OP shift its release into 2023.


Earlier this year, it seemed an end was finally in sight when KO_OP slapped it with a 15th June release date, but the studio has now opted to push the game&#x27;s launch back by another ten weeks &quot;after assessing its production schedule&quot;.

                              <span>Ted Chiang has an excellent essay in the New Yorker: “Will A.I. Become the New McKinsey?”
The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you’ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans­—one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn’t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has...</span>

If you have deployed Kubernetes pods with CPU and/or memory resources
specified, you may have noticed that changing the resource values involves
restarting the pod. This has been a disruptive operation for running
workloads... until now.
In Kubernetes v1.27, we have added a new alpha feature that allows users
to resize CPU/memory resources allocated to pods without restarting the
containers. To facilitate this, the resources field in a pod&#x27;s containers
now allow mutation for cpu and memory resources. They can be changed
simply by patching the running pod spec.
This also means that resources field in the pod spec can no longer be
relied upon as an indicator of the pod&#x27;s actual resources. Monitoring tools
and other such applications must now look at n…</span>

In a video posted to his YouTube channel, embedded below, Cain revealed the idea behind the vaults and their various dastardly experiments was to help scientists figure out how humans might survive interstellar travel - an idea he conveived after Fallout 1 came out in 1997.


Deciding there would be &quot;no earth to come back to&quot; in the event of a nuclear war, the head of the Enclave and the US government hatched a plan to build a starship that would take &quot;our best and brightest&quot; to a distant solar system in the hope of colonising a suitable planet.

                              <span>Nintendo has sent out a teasing fan survey, detailing the long-awaited Pikmin 4.


In it, Nintendo asks respondees to rate their knowledge of the Pikmin series so far (fairly strong), their impressions of Pikmin 4&#x27;s recent marketing (it&#x27;s been OK), and what they&#x27;d be keen to hear more about as its 21st July release date nears.


This last part is most interesting to me, as it touches on a few features Nintendo has only hinted at so far. This includes &quot;delving into puzzle-filled caves, and carefully managing your resources until you escape&quot; plus &quot;embarking on night-time missions that feature new and intense gameplay&quot;.

In October - when Google confirmed plans to shutter its cloud gaming service Stadia - developer Tequila Works announced its Stadia-exclusive horror game would go multiplatform, as other Stadia-exclusive games have done this year.


&quot;While playing it safe and a tad predictable, Tequila Works carefully layers on new gimmicks and mechanics as you progress through Gylt, allowing you to organically build on your knowledge and start experimenting,&quot; Vikki wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Gylt review.

                              <span>An image of an unannounced new map for Warzone 2 has popped up online.


The image emerged yesterday on the @BKTOOR4 Twitter account, apparently from a datamine. It didn&#x27;t take long for Activision to haul the tweet offline, but of course the internet noticed.


According to Charlie Intel, this new Resurgence map is called Vondel and is set in The Netherlands, which should make for a welcome palette-cleanser following the sandy Al Mazrah map and the current Ashika Island Resurgence map.

                              <span>Insomniac Games is yet to announce a firm release date for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, but if you are itching for more web-centric content in your life, you can at least now have a read of the game&#x27;s prequel comic.


This comic was announced last week, along with the standalone PlayStation 5 version of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered. After a brief time of being available in US comic book stores, the entire thing is now online for free. 


I have had a read of the comic myself, and it is a nice, pretty condensed, standalone story that should help fill some of the void between now and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&#x27;s eventual debut (don&#x27;t worry, I am not going to spoil anything here). If you are interested in having a read of what Peter Parker and co. have been getting up to ahead of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&#x27;s release, you can check out the online version of the comic here.

                              <span>First-person shooter Mouse has gathered quite the excitement in the last 24 hours, thanks to its... distinct art style and protagonist.


The game will see you play as John Mouston, a private detective sniffing out corruption and rogue rodents. Inspired by rubber hose animation, John Mouston bears some resemblance to Walt Disney&#x27;s beloved Mickey Mouse. Indeed, he has the long snout(is that correct terminology?) with a round nose, the big ears and the white gloves. But he also has a revolver and cigars, so he&#x27;s definitely not Mickey Mouse.


The gameplay we&#x27;ve seen so far gives me Doom vibes, whilst the vending machines remind me a lot of BioShock. I&#x27;d be lying if I said it doesn&#x27;t look fun to play.

While details of the showcase have not been revealed, its announcement perhaps contains some hints as to what we can expect.

                              <span>Bella Ramsey, perhaps best known on this site for playing Ellie in HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation, has briefly hung up her shivs and bricks to take Gran Turismo 7 for a test drive. 


Ramsey, who has previously spoken about her repeated attempts to get a driving licence, is now promoting Sony&#x27;s racing sim on the PSVR2. &quot;I am about to take my fifth driving test,&quot; the actor begins, before admitting she is a bit nervous about the whole ordeal. It should all be ok, right? Because, after all, Ramsey has a nice PSVR2 set and Gran Turismo 7, so she&#x27;ll get plenty of practice.


Cut to Ramsey tearing her way round Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s race tracks in her new VR wheels, with an appropriate amount of whooping and mock road rage. But alas, these new found tactics and moves do not work in the real world, and Ramsey does not pass her driving test. &quot;You were doing 80 in a 30,&quot; her driving instructor explains. It&#x27;s a really fun advert, so do check it out for yourself below.

In a post on Blizzard.com, the developer said Diablo 4 will get a new season each quarter, and each will add questlines, battle passes, new legendary items, class balance changes and other tweaks.


Season 1 begins in mid to late July (Diablo 4 launches early June). To access it you have to complete the campaign.

                              <span>NetherRealm Studios has released yet another video teasing the next entry in its long-running Mortal Kombat series - and there&#x27;s mounting speculation it could be hinting at a reboot.


NetherRealm shared a first teaser at the start of this month, appended to a video celebrating Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30th anniversary. It showed sands steadily trickling through an hourglass before a sudden camera zoom focused in on the very last grain, which then exploded.


It&#x27;s now been four years since the launch of Mortal Kombat 11, and news-starved fans immediately began speculating NetherRealm&#x27;s mysterious video was in some way teasing an imminent reveal for Mortal Kombat 12 - with one theory suggesting Kronika&#x27;s time-and-space-altering hourglass, which featured prominently in the previous game, may have gone awry, somehow resetting the universe.

                              <span>Dordogne, developer Un Je Ne Sais Quoi&#x27;s gorgeously presented narrative adventure about long-forgotten childhood summers, finally has a release date and is coming to PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 on 13th June.


First revealed back in 2020, Dordogne casts players as 32-year-old Mimi who, at the start of the game, returns to the home of her recently deceased grandmother in the titular French province, where she begins to reflect on the summers of her youth.


From there, the adventure splits across two timelines; in one, present-day Mimi explores her grandmother&#x27;s home, rifling through souvenirs and solving puzzles, while ten-year-old Mimi faces her own challenges, from forest walks and climbing to kayaking and cave explorations.

Imagine you’re using an AI chatbot to plan a vacation. Did it suggest a particular resort because it knows your preferences, or because the company is getting a kickback from the hotel chain? Later, when you’re using another AI chatbot to learn about a complex economic issue, is the chatbot reflecting your politics or the politics of the company that trained it?...</span>

In Kubernetes, a Service can be used to provide a unified traffic endpoint for
applications running on a set of Pods. Clients can use the virtual IP address (or VIP) provided
by the Service for access, and Kubernetes provides load balancing for traffic accessing
different back-end Pods, but a ClusterIP type of Service is limited to providing access to
nodes within the cluster, while traffic from outside the cluster cannot be routed.
One way to solve this problem is to use a type: NodePort Service, which sets up a mapping
to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, thus redirecting traffic from the
outside to the inside of the cluster.
How Kubernetes allocates node ports to Services?
When a type: NodePort Service is created, its corresponding port(s) are al…</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft has today announced job cuts to its customer services team, with up to 60 positions expected to be lost across the UK and US.


Here in the UK, Ubisoft operates a Customer Relation Centre (CRC) in Newscastle. In the US, it runs a similar team based in Cary, North Carolina. 


One developer writing on Twitter said they had been &quot;laid off today with no notice&quot; and were now desperately seeking work.

                              <span>Good, great, so if you clicked on this article, I&#x27;m going to assume you&#x27;re not fussed about spoilers and that we can now continue unimpeded, no longer having to wiggle around the issue at hand. Dungeons! Mitherflipping dungeons are returning in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom!


More specifically - according to Nintendo&#x27;s Hidemaro Fujibayashi, speaking in a new Ask the Developer interview - &quot;huge&quot;, &quot;traditional&quot; dungeons are making their return to the Legend of Zelda series in Tears of the Kingdom after their conspicuous absence in Breath of the Wild.


Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s predecessor saw Nintendo shake up the traditional Zelda formula in a big way, not just in its sprawling open-world, but by replacing lengthy, elaborate dungeons - which have been part of the Zelda series since its inception in 1986 - with micro-dungeon-like Shrines and more expansive, although largely forgettable, Divine Beasts.

I didn&#x27;t know this (I&#x27;m on the Inquisition&#x27;s blacklist, apprently). I just realised this afternoon while watching the latest gameplay trailer for Auroch Digital&#x27;s upcoming boomer shooter - aka old-school Doom in a Warhammer 40,000 skin.


Near the end of the video, below, we hear the player character, an Ultramarine Sternguard Veteran hell bent on ripping the forces of Chaos to shreds, declare through his vox: &quot;I will finish the work Captain Titus started.&quot;

                              <span>The European Commission - the EU&#x27;s antitrust regulator - is reportedly set to approve Microsoft&#x27;s proposed Activision Blizzard deal.


According to Reuters, the regulator is set to approve the deal sometime next week. Sources familiar with the matter said 15th May (next Monday) is the likeliest date for this, however the EC&#x27;s own deadline for its decision on Microsoft&#x27;s proposed deal is still set for 22nd May.


The regulator had previously announced a provisional deadline of 25th April for its decision on the potential takeover, but that date shifted to May after Microsoft submitted remedies in its efforts to gain approval from regulatory bodies.

                              <span>Hey again, Tom here. I&#x27;m really excited to announce today that Eurogamer reviews are changing. Here&#x27;s a bit about how, and the thinking behind why.


In short, Eurogamer is moving to a five-star review rating system, beginning this week.  


For years now, I&#x27;ve felt our existing review badges weren&#x27;t working hard enough for us, or for you. We ended up recommending a lot of games, or not giving a badge at all to many others - which meant readers not acquainted with our odd four-point scale had nothing to go on. We rarely used Avoid, because it always felt a bit mean.

The 60fps option scales the resolution down - you can pick the default resolution mode if you want to enjoy the visuals at their best.


Asobo Studio&#x27;s well-received rat-infested sequel also now has enhanced graphics for PC, with a Nintendo Switch cloud version due out next week. Meanwhile, all platforms get several bug fixes.

                              <span>EA has added a rather unique warning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor players who try to bypass its story elements. 


Many out there enjoy the challenge of exploiting games in such a way that will allow them to progress through a story quicker. Speedrunning communities exist to share tricks and glitches that sometimes see entire areas skipped - because someone managed to crouch next to that one specific bit of wall while holding that one specific sword in their left hand (or something like that).


EA is clearly aware of this, and has implemented an in-game message that triggers if a player reaches an area that should be, in theory, unreachable at that point in the game. Should this happen, a warning will pop up on the player&#x27;s screen stating &quot;an unexpected error&quot; has occurred.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a new advert for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and on my first watch through I had my video game news reporter hat on, looking closely at the gameplay moments for fresh clues. 


My efforts didn&#x27;t really bring up much new. I now know that for your Ultrahand-made raft to not topple over in the water, you need to make sure it is balanced by some support logs on either side. But that really is about it in terms of gameplay analysis. 


Then I watched it again, and this time my mind was drawn not to Link gadabouting through the sky, but to the real life, &quot;everyday&quot; man the advert actually focuses on. It is quite clear what (or who) Nintendo is trying to paint a picture of here.

Team Cherry had planned to launch Silksong before July this year. Spokesperson Matthew Griffin last night admitted via Twitter that development was &quot;still continuing&quot; and the team wanted to &quot;take the time to make the game as good as we can&quot;.


Another reason for the delay? Silksong has also now &quot;gotten quite big&quot;, Griffin said.

FIFA 23 has done remarkably well for EA, with financial fourth quarter revenue just for the FIFA franchise up 31 percent year-on-year.

                              <span>EA has announced its latest financial earning, confirming record net bookings of $1.95B for its most recent quarter - and, alas, the news that BioWare&#x27;s highly anticipated Dragon Age: Dreadwolf won&#x27;t be out until at least April next year.


Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which has been in some form of development since at least 2017, has never been given an official release date, but reports last year suggested BioWare was targeting a late 2023 launch for the long-awaited title.


Hopes for a 2023 release among fans remained unabated when, last October, the studio confirmed Dreadwolf had reached the alpha stage of development and was playable &quot;to the very end&quot; - but those hopes have now been dashed through omission, via EA&#x27;s newly revealed release schedule for the current financial year.

Details of the title are limited, but the companies have shared an unexpectedly moody bit of concept art to accompany today&#x27;s news, showcasing a character adorned in something like traditional Japanese garb amid a forest of towering trees.


&quot;We&#x27;re thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work,&quot; Game Freak director Kota Furushima said in a statement. &quot;From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise give us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can&#x27;t wait to share more about in the future.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Ironmace Games has delayed the early access release of its mediaeval extraction looter Dark and Darker as it remains embroiled in a legal dispute with Korean game publisher Nexon over &quot;copyright infringement&quot;.


Dark and Darker received a hugely positive reception when it made a Steam Next Fest appearance earlier this year, but things went quickly awry.


In March, Nexon accused Ironmace of &quot;using materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at Nexon to create Dark and Darker, soon after issuing a cease and desist demand which resulted in the game&#x27;s removal from Steam. This has forced the developer to get creative as it continues to release new playtest builds to players.

                              <span>Bungie&#x27;s winning streak against Destiny 2 cheat sellers continues with the news it&#x27;s now been awarded $6.7m USD in damages following a ruling in its lawsuit against LaviCheats.


Bungie filed its claim against LaviCheats owner Kunal Bansal back in 2021, alongside lawsuits against two other cheat sellers: Elite Tech Boss and VeteranCheats. Elite Boss Tech agreed to settle last July, paying $13.5m in damages, and a court ruled against VeteranCheats earlier this month, ordering it to pay Bungie $12m USD in damages.


That just left the developer&#x27;s case against LaviCheats and (as spotted by TorrentFreak) a federal court in Washington has now issued a default judgment against the India-based Bansal - as requested in a motion filed by Bungie earlier this year - after he failed to appear in court.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has reportedly hired high-profile UK lawyer Lord David Pannick KC - whose client list has included Queen Elizabeth II and Boris Johnson - to help lead its appeal against the Competition and Merger Authority&#x27;s recent ruling against its proposed merger with Microsoft.


The CMA recently made the shock decision to block Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn acquisition of Activision following its months-long investigation, citing concerns over the deal&#x27;s impact on the cloud gaming sector, which it said risked &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;.


In response, Microsoft announced it would be appealing the CMA&#x27;s decision, while Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick told staff the move would &quot;stifle investment, competition, and job creation throughout the UK gaming industry&quot;, insisting &quot;it is far from the final word on this deal&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty fans have heavily criticised Activision for a newly-released &quot;pay-to-win&quot; bundle deemed the most egregious so far.


The Roze and Thorn bundle includes the Thorns Out Roze operator skin. This skin spawns players with a free UAV bonus effect for the popular extraction mode, DMZ.


In Call of Duty, a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) reveals enemy locations on the mini-map for 30 seconds - a particularly useful ability in a game that involves player versus environment versus player elements. The effect is potentially pronounced in squad play, where up to six can team up.

In its recent financial report, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed The Last of Us is now averaging nearly 32 million cross-platform viewers per episode in the States. 


In addition to this, the company stated The Last of Us is the &quot;most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in both Europe and Latin America&quot;. This data is all based on figures from market measurement firm Nielsen, as well as first-party data.

                              <span>Horizon Forbidden West has sold 8.4m copies, Sony has announced.


In a PlayStation Blog post celebrating developer Guerrilla&#x27;s 20th birthday, studio director and studio art and animation director Jan-Bart van Beek confirmed the sales milestone for Sony&#x27;s flagship exclusive was achieved 14 months after it launched in February 2022.


As of 16th April 2023, the Horizon franchise sold more than 32.7m units, van Beek said. Those sales are described as &quot;sold through&quot;, which means genuine sales to customers. &quot;Millions more&quot; have played a Horizon game via PlayStation&#x27;s subscription services and other offers, including PlayStation Plus and Play at Home, Sony&#x27;s 2020 free games offer to help entertain people during Covid lockdowns.

This bundle is available now, and can be scooped up for as little as $10 (the platform says the bundle is valued at over $750, so quite the deal). 


Titles in this bundle include puzzle game A Good Snowman is Hard to Build, roguelike stealth furniture eating simulator Not the Robots and eco-adventure Gibbon: Beyond the Trees (pictured above), to name but a few. Here&#x27;s the link to the whole lot.

That&#x27;s according to Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, who spoke with investors this morning following the company&#x27;s most recent financial results (via Bloomberg). 


The Switch has now passed its hardware sales peak, with console sales down 22 percent over the past 12 months. Nintendo forecasts a further fall over the coming year.

That&#x27;s according to GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s Chris Dring, who revealed Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s digital downloads accounted for almost double the amount Fallen Order managed.


Dring noted that even though Survivor&#x27;s physical sales were down on Fallen Order&#x27;s, overall sales were markedly up from EA&#x27;s 2019 release.

                              <span>Starfield, following in the footsteps of the Fallout games, has cheesy post-sex pillow talk.


Confirmation comes from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which in its Starfield rating summary spilled the beans that Bethesda&#x27;s next game not only lets players have sex, but splutter lines of dialogue after the deed.


This &quot;suggestive material&quot;, as the ESRB puts it, includes moral panic-inducing lines such as &quot;Life is a sexually transmitted disease that&#x27;s a hundred percent fatal&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m all for getting a little wild, but next time let&#x27;s try it without the jetpacks&quot;; and &quot;Talk about seeing stars, whew... that was amazing&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch console sales dropped by almost a quarter over the 12 months ending 31st March, though game sales remain strong. 


Nintendo painted a mixed picture in its latest financial results, with hardware sales now definitively past the console&#x27;s peak as the Switch enters its seventh year of life. 


That said, game sales remain strong - down only slightly on the console&#x27;s last two years in terms of first-party software like Pokémon and Splatoon, and still well up on 2020 and everything before that.

                              <span>After years of anticipation, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s release is now only a few days away. In order to make sure everyone is up to speed on what happened across Hyrule ahead of the sequel&#x27;s debut, Nintendo has released a video recapping Breath of the Wild&#x27;s story.


If you have a spare six-and-a-bit minutes, this video is a nice digestible way to relive the game&#x27;s plot. After all, Breath of the Wild did release six years ago, so a little refresher perhaps wouldn&#x27;t go amiss.  


As you would expect, Nintendo&#x27;s video covers everything from the four champions, some of the various enemies that Ganon has doing his bidding, and Zelda helping Link out in Breath of the Wild&#x27;s final confrontation. But that&#x27;s enough from me. Go and make yourself a quick brew and have a watch of Nintendo&#x27;s Breath of the Wild recap for yourself below.

                              <span>Hi-Fi Rush just got its fourth update, and it&#x27;s clear developer Tango Gameworks is having fun with the patch notes.


While the update is light on improvements, we do have a few standouts, such as &quot;adjusted couch pillow softness in the hideout to better refresh Chai when relaxing in between missions&quot;.


Hi-Fi Rush players will be familiar with Chai&#x27;s couch, on which he can snuggle robot cat 808, have a snooze or have a little chat with himself as he decompresses from the action-packed missions.

                              <span>Following a fairly glitchy release - particularly on PC, with Digital Foundry going so far as to call Star Wars Jedi: Survivor &quot;the worst triple-A PC port of 2023 so far&quot; - and an initial day one update, EA is continuing its efforts to fix Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.


This week sees the arrival of the game&#x27;s fourth patch, which addresses a variety of issues, both platform specific and across all versions of the game. 


With this patch in play, PC users can expect to see updated occlusion behaviour for raytracing, which will reduce idle time stalls. EA has also updated its PC streaming budgets, something the developer says will help alleviate traversal hitching. The team has also implemented general performance improvements for &quot;some VFX&quot; (this update will also be coming &quot;soon&quot; to console versions of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor). Lastly on the PC specific updates (for today, at least), EA has updated the data handling when toggling raytracing, improving non-raytraced performance.

Declarative configuration management with the kubectl apply command is the gold standard approach
to creating or modifying Kubernetes resources. However, one challenge it presents is the deletion
of resources that are no longer needed. In Kubernetes version 1.5, the --prune flag was
introduced to address this issue, allowing kubectl apply to automatically clean up previously
applied resources removed from the current configuration.
Unfortunately, that existing implementation of --prune has design flaws that diminish its
performance and can result in unexpected behaviors. The main issue stems from the lack of explicit

                              <span>Minimalist traffic management sim Mini Motorways and its subterranean predecessor Mini Metro are getting &quot;one of the series&#x27; biggest updates ever&quot; on 24th July, as part of developer Dinosaur Polo Club&#x27;s tenth &quot;Miniversary&quot; celebrations.


More specifically, Dinosaur Polo Club is marking ten years since the studio first hit upon the idea for Mini Metro during a Ludum Dare Game Jam, creating an early iteration of the game that would go on to make a major splash the following year.


Since then we&#x27;ve seen a successor in 2019&#x27;s majestic Mini Motorways, and Dinosaur Polo Club is now preparing the mother of all crossovers, announcing it&#x27;ll be bringing three Mini Metro maps into Mini Motorways, with three maps also going the other way in its big July update.

Volume group snapshot is introduced as an Alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.27.
This feature introduces a Kubernetes API that allows users to take crash consistent
snapshots for multiple volumes together. It uses a label selector to group multiple
PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting.
This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers.
An overview of volume group snapshots
Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of
multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents “copies” from multiple volumes that
are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate
new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to
a previous state (represented by the snapshots).

According to Axios and a recent court filing, 1548 women have received a payment of between $2500 and $5000 (£1977 - £3950) at Riot, whilst hundreds of Activision employees are also receiving payouts for a separate, but similar, settlement.

Whilst there have been efforts to contain the leak – including a fairly successful community boycott and takedown notices from NBC Universal – the teaser is still available if you&#x27;re prepared to look.

&quot;I got emails about this early in the day but was at an amusement park with my kids and was unable to see what had happened,&quot; series creator Scott Cawthon said in response to a thread added to the Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s subreddit.

                              <span>Bohemia Interactive has revealed that its upcoming sci-fi FPS/RTS hybrid, Silica, is now available as an early access title.

Developed through Bohemia&#x27;s Incubator initiative, Silica is &quot;a crossover of FPS and RTS&quot; where up to three factions battle for control over the planet Baltarus. 

&quot;Lead from above as commander, or experience the action first-hand, either alone, or with friends. Join one of two human armies, or hunt them down as the territorial aliens,&quot; the blurb teases. You can see it in action in the trailer below:

                              <span>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has once again smashed its all-time concurrent PC user peak.

According to SteamDB, CS:GO topped 1.8m concurrent users over the weekend, smashing not only its own simultaneous user record, but cementing itself as one of Steam&#x27;s biggest-ever games.

With 1,818,773 CS:GO players online at once yesterday, that means only PUBG: Battlegrounds now sports a higher concurrent count – no other game ever released on Steam comes close.

                              <span>An asymmetrical horror game that &quot;previously vanished from the market&quot; has returned to sale on Steam after its original developer shut down.

Last Year – which was originally developed by Elastic Games and &quot;amassed a passionate player base and hundreds of thousands of downloads since it first launched as a Discord exclusive in 2018&quot; – has been &quot;reborn&quot; by new developer Undaunted Games and returned to Steam as a free-to-play title.

&quot;We&#x27;ve always believed in the potential of this title,&quot; says Undaunted Games studio head and producer, Matthew Itovitch. &quot;When we did the marketing for the game at PAX East and West in 2018, we saw the reactions from players, and also what this game could be. Last Year definitely deserves another shot at realising that, and bringing back the game is the first step.&quot;

In the meantime, whilst the bug is investigated and hopefully resolved, EA provides guidelines on how players can try to troubleshoot the problem and restore their items - check out the support page for the full details.

                              <span>Mimimi Games – the studio behind stealth-strategy: zombie pirate adventure Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew – is warning players of a phishing campaign that&#x27;s tempting them to sign up for a beta code that doesn&#x27;t exist.

The studio states that by using a website that &quot;looks identical&quot; to the real one and using a &quot;very similar domain&quot;, scammers have fooled players into signing up to the bogus site to download a fake beta.

&quot;Mimimi Games is currently being targeted by a phishing campaign,&quot; the studio explains. &quot;Someone is sending out suspicious e-mails with a link to a website that looks identical to the real Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew website and is using a very similar domain, claiming there’s a free Beta download available.

Destiny 2&#x27;s annual Guardian Games month-long event kicked off earlier this week, ushering in a little more &quot;friendly competition&quot; between the three classes, Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks. So it came as quite a surprise when Bungie deployed an in-game message to all players that declared Warlocks had won.

&quot;Warlocks won Guardian Games 2023!&quot; the message stated. &quot;Warlocks win! Warlocks earned the most medallions and won this year&#x27;s Games! Visit the Tower for the Closing Ceremony.&quot;

Unlike its more typical pre-recorded Nintendo Direct, the Treehouse will be a live broadcast on 11th May that kicks off at 6.45pm PT – that&#x27;s 1.45am on 12th May UK time, and 2.45am in central Europe – and will include &quot;gameplay from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&quot;.

&quot;Get ready, Legend of Zelda fans!&quot; Nintendo announced on the Nintendo of America Twitter account. &quot;We will be hosting a special livestream leading up to the @NintendoNYC midnight launch of the Legend of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom.&quot;

                              <span>Amnesia: The Bunker, the new &quot;unscripted&quot; WW1 horror from SOMA developer Frictional Games, is almost upon us following a number of delays, and with its 23rd May release date looming, the studio has shared 10 new minutes of gameplay to ponder.


The Bunker, for a bit of context, is the fourth game in Frictional&#x27;s Amnesia series, which began with 2010&#x27;s acclaimed The Dark Descent. Since then we&#x27;ve seen a Chinese-Room-developed successor in 2013&#x27;s A Machine for Pigs, and Frictional returned to the series in 2021 with its ambitious Amnesia: Rebirth, set in the Algerian desert. 


Frictional&#x27;s latest, Amnesia: The Bunker, marks a notable departure for the series, trading traditionally linear tales of horror for &quot;unscripted&quot; scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world as players - in the role of French solider Henri Clément - attempt to flee a relentless, &quot;adaptive&quot; otherworldly creature through the claustrophobic confines of the titular subterranean space.

                              <span>Saturnalia, the acclaimed - and previously Epic Games Store exclusive - survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is making its way to Steam with a first-person mode and other new features later this year.


Saturnalia originally released last October, taking players on a journey through the ancient, ever-shifting town of the title in adventure heavily inspired by Sardinia folklore.


The gist is players - switching between four different characters at will - must explore, avoid the things in the shadows, and solve the mystery of Saturnalia in order to earn their freedom. Only, should all four characters die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

                              <span>PixelOpus, the PlayStation Studios developer behind Concrete Genie, is shutting down.


Based in San Mateo, California, PixelOpus was established with the express purpose of giving young developers a start in the industry, and was formally announced as a new internal Sony studio in 2014. It would go on to release its first game, the striking Entwined, that same year.


While PixelOpus&#x27; initial outing received a mixed critical reception, its follow-up title, Concrete Genie, fared much better in 2019. It was nominated for a BAFTA Artistic Achievement award, and Eurogamer called it a &quot;small, perfectly formed adventure&quot; in our Recommended review.

                              <span>Bungie has announced a 20% price increase for Destiny 2&#x27;s standalone season pass, but the studio says its all-in-one Annual Pass won&#x27;t be affected by the move.


Destiny 2 first added a battle-pass-style Season Pass as part of its third year of content, back in 2019. Since then, each three-month-long Season Pass has been priced at 1,000 Silver (approximately £9/$10 USD depending on premium currency bundle), making this the first price bump since their introduction.


Bungie&#x27;s newly announced 20% price increase - which won&#x27;t affect the Lightfall standard edition season pass or Lightfall and Annual Pass edition - means each new Season Pass will now cost 1,200 Silver. Additionally, Destiny 2&#x27;s Season Pass + 10 Ranks Bundle will cost 2,200 Silver instead of 2,000.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we discuss the latest headache for Microsoft - Redfall&#x27;s negative launch reaction -  and the eye-opening comments made by Xbox boss Phil Spencer as he subsequently discussed what went wrong. 

We also look beyond Redfall at the pressure now on Microsoft to deliver with Starfield, following various first-party delays and disappointments over the past few years. As Xbox takes stock of its progress this console generation, big questions remain over how it competes in the years to come - with some potentially gloomy (for Microsoft) answers. 
Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>As the fallout from Redfall&#x27;s release continues, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has raised eyebrows with his claim that Microsoft expected the game to score much better in critics&#x27; reviews. 


During a wide-ranging interview with Kinda Funny, Spencer said Xbox had planned for Redfall to land with an average review score &quot;double digits&quot; higher than the one it actually got.


&quot;We do mock reviews for every game we launch, and this is double digits lower than we thought we would be with this game,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;That&#x27;s one of the disappointing things. We would never strive to launch a game that we thought was going to review in the low-60s. It&#x27;s not part of our goals.&quot;

Space World, which ran until 2001, was essentially a precursor to the digital-only Direct showcases, where Nintendo would reveal its new games and hardware. The 2000 show was infamous for revealing both the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance.


Consolevariations&#x27; Donny Fillerup was recently alerted to a strange prototype GameCube, Kotaku reported, which turned out to be one of the original machines shown at Space World 2000.

                              <span>Dredd and The Boys star Karl Urban is reportedly in-line to play Johnny Cage in Mortal Kombat 2.


According to IGN, the Hollywood movie star is in final negotiations to play the video game movie star in the sequel to 2021&#x27;s popular Mortal Kombat film.


For me, Urban is an odd pick for Johnny Cage. In the Mortal Kombat games Cage is a clean cut, quick-witted action movie star whose vanity is matched only by his star-studded smile. When I think of Karl Urban, I think of all his gruff, beardy roles, such as Judge Dredd in the wonderful Dredd movie, the superhero hating Billy Butcher, and the hairy rider of Rohan, Éomer in The Lord of the Rings. For Cage, I&#x27;m thinking Ryan Gosling&#x27;s Ken or Ryan Reynolds&#x27; Deadpool, without the suit.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has insisted making great games won&#x27;t help Microsoft catch up to Sony and Nintendo in the console race.


Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Series X and S currently lag behind Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch, with sales struggling.


And after the disastrous launch of Redfall - something Spencer has personally apologised for - Microsoft faces increasingly tough questions over Microsoft&#x27;s ability to regularly release high quality triple-A games, and the future growth of subscription service Game Pass.

                              <span>This is just a quick reminder that Sony will be dropping its PlayStation Plus Collection next week. So, this is your last chance to get your hands on some PS4 classics such as Bloodborne, Until Dawn, The Last of Us Remastered and Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End before the collection is disbanded for good. 


The PlayStation Plus Collection was introduced back in 2020 as a curated selection of great PS4 games that PlayStation 5 owners would be able to download and play on their new generation consoles. 


However, on 9th May, the following 19 PS4 games will be removed from PS Plus, as Sony is removing the collection from its service.

                              <span>Upcoming open-world racer Lego 2K Drive will be kept updated with four season passes over the next year, though you can unlock their rewards without time limits. 


Each season pass also has a free and premium track, so you have fresh goals to aim for and cosmetics to unlock whether you pay, or not. And if you start off free, you can always upgrade later to instantly get all premium rewards up to that point.


Season 1 will begin in June, with a second to follow in autumn, a third in winter and a fourth in spring 2024. Each will host 100 levels.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is preparing to send bamboozle-proof buccaneers off on another ARG-like adventure, with the multiplayer pirate game&#x27;s second Mystery, The Hoarder&#x27;s Hunt, now confirmed to launch next Thursday, 11th May.


Sea of Thieves&#x27; first Mystery, which ran from May to September last year, was a lovely idea in principle, weaving a web of devious clues - both in and out of the game - that would eventually reveal the culprit behind the murder of prominent character DeMarco Singh.


It certainly had its moments - the magical in-game lantern given to players at the start of the Mystery, revealing clues wherever its light shone in the world, was a lovely bit of clue-hunting paraphernalia - but, unfortunately, the whole thing just ended up lurching awkwardly to its less-than-stellar conclusion, hindered by a clumsy, immersion-shattering insistence on gating progress behind social media engagement targets.

                              <span>For the King 2 - the sequel to IronOak Games&#x27; wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure - is getting a closed beta next week, and registration is now open.


IronOak&#x27;s follow-up - which pits players against the kingdom of Fahrul&#x27;s tyrannical queen 20 years after the end of the first game - is, from what&#x27;s been shown so far, less a bold new direction for the series and more a deepening of the original&#x27;s already hugely entertaining core.


That means another light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure blending familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat story generation through randomised narrative events.

Kubernetes v1.27, released in April 2023, introduced changes to
Memory QoS (alpha) to improve memory management capabilites in Linux nodes.
Support for Memory QoS was initially added in Kubernetes v1.22, and later some
limitations
around the formula for calculating memory.high were identified. These limitations are
addressed in Kubernetes v1.27.
Background
Kubernetes allows you to optionally specify how much of each resources a container needs
in the Pod specification. The most common resources to specify are CPU and Memory.
For example, a Pod manifest that defines container resource requirements could look like:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: example
spec:
containers:
- name: nginx
resources:
requests:
memory: &quot;64Mi&quot;
cpu: &quot;250m&quot;
limits:
memory: &quot;6…</span>

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has personally apologised for the failure of Arkane&#x27;s Redfall, which was widely panned this week.


The triple-A first-party shooter has suffered a disastrous launch, with players and reviewers criticising everything from the blandness of its world to the many bugs, its uninspired looter shooter mechanics to performance issues. It is Arkane&#x27;s worst-reviewed game, and has a &quot;mostly negative&quot; user review rating on Steam.


The failure of Redfall has also brought into question Microsoft&#x27;s ability to launch high-quality games with any regularity after a string of high-profile flops, and has caused some to cancel their Game Pass subscription between now and the upcoming launch of Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield in September.

AI is very much a topic of concern for the games industry right now. Recent releases, such as High On Life and the upcoming System Shock remake, have both used AI during development and its use has raised eyebrows among players. 
There was a mix of concerns and excitement regarding AI among developers at GDC in March, Chris Tapsell reported. Following the UK government&#x27;s white paper on AI which was published in March, the CMA is now assessing potential effects of the technology on markets and consumers.

                              <span>Bugsnax, the game that tasks its players with finding and capturing the eponymous half-bug-half-snack creatures on the mysterious island of Snaktooth, is heading to the iOS app store &quot;this summer&quot;.


On its release, it will boast touch screen controls, but will also support &quot;a wide array of third party gamepads&quot; developer Young Horses says. 
Other than that, news on this upcoming release is fairly barren, but the developer has promised more details (I presume such as a firm release date rather than the broad release window we have now) in the future.

                              <span>Korean studio Npixel has revealed fresh gameplay footage of its forthcoming MMORPG Chrono Odyssey.


The game is being built on Unreal Engine 5 and this second trailer for the game really shows off the power of the engine.


The setting is a western-style fantasy world of magic and dragons, but the pretty graphics are certainly eye-catching. Check out the trailer for yourself below.

F1 23 brings back the series&#x27; story mode, Braking Point, which was first introduced in F1 21 but was absent from F1 22 last year.


Take a look at the trailer below, which includes protagonists Aidan Jackson, Devon Butler, and new kid on the block Callie Mayer (who is also Devon&#x27;s sister), plus some glimpses of two new circuits.

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has responded to a recent estimate of its app store revenue, which appeared to show a sizable dip for the month of April, when controversial changes to remote raid passes took effect.


The claim, by third-party app store analytics firm AppMagic, initially reported by MobileGamer.biz, suggested Pokémon Go&#x27;s revenue had taken a big hit last month - to its lowest monthly total since February 2018, over five years ago.


Responding to Eurogamer today, Niantic said the estimate was wrong, and that Pokémon Go&#x27;s 2023 revenue to date was up on the same period in 2022.

The newspaper created a map in CS:GO to distribute &quot;independent journalism&quot;, which launched yesterday on World Press Freedom Day.


The map (pictured), based on a war-torn Slavic city, includes a secret room that shows uncensored footage of the Ukraine invasion in Russian.

In fact, the whole situation has made him embrace his inner Liam Neeson.


In response to one Twitter user sharing an image of their Switch home screen, which had Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lined up and ready to play (presumably obtained by illegitimate means, but I can&#x27;t say for sure), the Nintendo of America alum decided to flex his muscle by quoting from the Neeson-fronted action film Taken.


&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you want. What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you,&quot; Fils-Aimé wrote.

                              <span>Discord has announced changes to usernames, after taking feedback on their format.
At present, usernames are case sensitive and have a four digit identifier, called a discriminator, appended to create a unique username.
The new changes will remove the need for the discriminator, meaning you don&#x27;t have to remember the random number combination when trying to add friends.

                              <span>Nightdive, the studio behind the System Shock remake, recently boasted about using AI to create artwork of its game&#x27;s own evil AI. And, well, things slightly backfired on the developer.


Nightdive used AI software Midjourney to create a picture of Shodan, and then proceeded to share the image on its social media feeds. 


&quot;Look at you, hacker: a pathetic creature of meat and bone. Your body, weak, fragile. How can you challenge a perfect machine? Imagine, how would my immortal body look like? Designed by an immortal machine for an immortal machine,&quot; the studio wrote, with the accompanying picture of System Shock&#x27;s antagonist.

The news comes from a tweet by the country&#x27;s Public Authority for Media, which gives age classifications of video games.


According to the tweet, the game will not be released &quot;due to the publisher&#x27;s unwillingness to make the necessary modifications&quot; (translated by Google).

                              <span>Former BioWare veteran David Gaider has criticised his former studio for its evolving approach to video game narrative, up until his departure from the studio in 2016, amidst the troubled development of multiplayer shooter Anthem.


In a string of posts on Twitter, Gaider said video game writing was &quot;constantly undervalued&quot; - even so at BioWare, which in Gaider&#x27;s words &quot;built its success on a reputation for good stories and characters&quot;.


&quot;[It] slowly turned from a company that vocally valued its writers to one where we were... quietly resented, with a reliance on expensive narrative seen as the &#x27;albatross&#x27; holding the company back,&quot; Gaider wrote.

As per Blizzard&#x27;s announcement post, things gets underway next Wednesday, 10th May, at 7pm BST/11am PDT via Twitch and YouTube, with Diablo franchise general manager Rod Fergusson, associate game director Joseph Piepiora, product management director Kegan Clark, and associate director of community Adam Fletcher all confirmed to appear.


The conversation this time around will focus on Diablo 4&#x27;s heavy heap of, somewhat contentious, live-service elements, including its seasons model, optional battle pass, and cosmetics.

                              <span>Bungie has secured another legal win against a Destiny 2 cheat-seller, with a court this time ordering the defendant to pay $12m USD in damages.


Bungie filed a lawsuit against Romanian cheat-seller Mihai Claudiu-Florentin - who it claimed was behind Destiny 2 cheating software VeteranCheats - last year, alleging (thanks TheGamePost) copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), and intentional interference with contractual relations.


Bungie had been seeking $11,696,000 in damages, a figure based on the $2,000 Claudiu-Florentin would make from each sale of VeteranCheats across a total of 5,848 downloads. The Washington Western District Court has now granted Bungie&#x27;s request, deeming the studio to have sufficiently proven its claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract, but not of the CPA violation.

                              <span>Unity Software - the company behind the widely used Unity game engine - has announced its third round of layoffs in under 12 months, this time affecting 600 jobs, equating to approximately 8% of its total workforce.


Today&#x27;s job losses were confirmed in a company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with Unity only saying the move would affect &quot;specific teams&quot; as it continues to &quot;position itself for long-term and profitable growth&quot;.


According to the Wall Street Journal (paywalled), this latest round of layoffs will leave Unity with approximately 7,000 employees, and comes ahead of the San Francisco-based company&#x27;s plans to reduce its current global network of offices from 58 to fewer than 30.

We should expect more of this kind of thing. The applications of AI to political advertising have not escaped campaigners, who are already “pressure testing” possible uses for the technology. In the 2024 presidential election campaign, you can bank on the appearance of AI-generated personalized fundraising emails, text messages from chatbots urging you to vote, and maybe even some deepfaked campaign ...</span>

are scaled down.
What problem does this solve?
A StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the
Kubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior

                              <span>Pokémon TCG Live, the official free-to-play smartphone and desktop adaptation of the venerable trading card game, finally has a released day, and will be launching on 8th June.


The Pokémon Company announced Pokémon TCG Live all the way back in 2021, with the expectation it would get a soft launch in Canada that same year. Not long after, however, both the mobile soft launch and global open beta for desktop were formally delayed to 2022 to create a &quot;more polished experience&quot;.


With TCG Live&#x27;s current beta period now nearing its end, The Pokémon Company is finally ready to share a launch date, and all versions - that is the iOS and Android app, alongside a desktop release for Mac and Windows - will arrive at 6pm BST/10am PDT on 8th June.

                              <span>Hang onto your spiderwebs, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered will be getting a standalone PlayStation 5 release later this month.


Previously, this remastered version of Spider-Man&#x27;s PS4 outing was reserved for those who decided to splash out on Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition.


Those who already own any of the original PS4 versions of the game will be able to upgrade to the remastered PS5 version for $10. Meanwhile, If you are buying the game for the first time, it will set you back $49.99. There is no word on UK pricing for now, but Eurogamer has asked Sony for clarification. A quick PSA, those PlayStation Plus members who claimed any edition of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man via their subscription are not eligible for the PS5 upgrade.

It stars Double Dragon&#x27;s famous duo Billy and Jimmy Lee as well as new playable characters in what&#x27;s described as a &quot;modernised celebration&quot; of the beat &#x27;em-up genre.


There&#x27;s co-op (couch co-op for launch, online co-op later this year), 13 playable characters, and pixel art visuals. The trailer is below:

You play a Trooper as part of 16-player co-op versus Starship Troopers&#x27; famous nasty alien bugs. You need to complete objectives, gather resources, build and defend your base then escape to the extraction point in squads of four.

                              <span>Microsoft has chosen today to announce final details of its Xbox Game Showcase, which will also feature an in-depth look at the highly-anticipated Starfield. 


You&#x27;ll be able to tune in via YouTube, Twitch and Facebook on Sunday, 11th June at 6pm UK time for Microsoft&#x27;s main showcase event, with Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield featured in an extensive deep dive directly after.


Today&#x27;s confirmation of the event&#x27;s timing comes just a day after Microsoft released Redfall on PC and Xbox to lukewarm reviews. All eyes are now on the delayed Starfield, as Microsoft&#x27;s biggest release of the year.

But despite being ready for broadcast, the episodes were never made public.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a bumpy old ride for THQ Nordic&#x27;s Saints Row reboot, but, now, after several months focused on bug fixes and improvements, developer Volition has confirmed the game&#x27;s first bit of paid story DLC, The Heist and The Hazardous, will arrive next Tuesday, 9th May.


The Heist and The Hazardous, which was unveiled as part of Saints Row&#x27;s updated roadmap back in March, is the first of three promised content drops for the open-world crime caper&#x27;s paid Expansion Pass, bringing new story missions, events, cosmetics, and more.


THQ Nordic still hasn&#x27;t shared much in the way of specifics beyond that, but we do now know it&#x27;ll see the Saints embarking on an adventure to exact &quot;sweet revenge&quot; after obnoxious movie star Chris Hardy double-crosses the Boss on a successful assassination hit.

                              <span>Convergence: A League of Legends Story - the time-manipulating parkour platformer (and, yes, League of Legends spin-off) from developer Double Stallion and Riot Games publishing arm Riot Forge - launches for Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 23rd May.


Convergence (or CONV/RGENCE, if you really must) is the third entry in Riot Forge&#x27;s genre-hopping, externally developed A League of Legends Story series, which takes familiar faces from Riot Games&#x27; wildly popular MOBA and deposits them in their own standalone adventures. 


So far, the series has featured a turn-based RPG from developer Airship Syndicate, titled Ruined King: A League of Legends Story, as well as Choice Provisions&#x27; puzzler Hextech Mayhem, and last month&#x27;s action-RPG The Mageseeker, created by Digital Sun. It&#x27;s all change again for Convergence, which shines a spotlight on League of Legends&#x27; dimension-hopping, time-manipualiting Ekko, and brings yet another a new genre focus.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns&#x27; long-delayed PS4 and Xbox One versions will finally launch next Thursday, 11th May - but the previously announced Switch release is now officially cancelled.


Midnight Suns - which blends card-battling turn-based combat and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building into a superb superhero strategy whole - had a bit of a bumpy road to release, getting two delays before it finally launched for PC, Series X/S, and PS5 last December.


At the time of its second delay, 2K made the surprise announcement it was postponing Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Switch indefinitely, only saying those versions would launch at &quot;a later date&quot; - and we&#x27;ve had no further updates until today.

                              <span>Fall Guys is back with a new season of stuff next Wednesday, 10th May, but there&#x27;s a major new addition this time around, with developer Mediatonic having just unveiled a build-it-yourself Creative mode, giving players the tools to construct and share their own levels.


Creative mode functions pretty much as you&#x27;d expect, offering what looks to be an intuitive, fully featured construction toolkit available directly in-game. Mediatonic demoed the new mode in today&#x27;s reveal livestream, explaining that, at launch, players will be able to build Races levels using either Fall Guys&#x27; original or new digital themes - with additional themes, round types, obstacles, and music set to be added in future updates.


After budding builders have selected their round type and theme, Creative mode then whisks them into a new building view, where they can call up a list of available objects, grouped by category, including obstacles, decorations, and more.

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper is being adapted into a tabletop RPG named Cycles of the Eye.


Like the video game, it&#x27;s a solo game broken down into turns called cycles with your energy represented by dice. However, Cycles of the Eye is driven by a tarot deck of cards to represent challenges, resources, characters and more.


Citizen Sleeper was inspired by TTRPGs so this adaptation certainly makes sense.

WIRED can now confirm that the operation was actually discovered by the DOJ six months earlier, in late May 2020­but the scale and significance of the breach wasn’t immediately apparent. Suspicions were triggered when the department detected unusual traffic emanating from one of its servers that was running a trial version of the Orion software suite made by SolarWinds, according to sources familiar with the incident. The software, used by system administrators to manage and configure networks, was communicating externally with an unfamiliar system on the internet. The DOJ asked the security firm Mandiant to help determine whether the server had been hacked. It also engaged Microsoft, though it’s not clear why the software maker was also brought onto the investigation...</span>

                              <span>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can now refer a friend to PC Game Pass, and gift them 14 days of free subscription time. 


Invited friends must be new to Game Pass to redeem the trial, and you&#x27;re limited to doing this with five people. Also, to be clear, this is just for the PC portion of Game Pass. 


Still, two weeks&#x27; of free game time is nothing to be sniffed at, and this membership of course includes access to new first-party Xbox games - such as Redfall - and the included access to EA Play and Riot Games libraries.

                              <span>Square Enix has shown our first look at gameplay from Forspoken DLC - In Tanta We Trust.


Releasing on 26th May across PlayStation 5 and PC, it&#x27;s a prequel to the main game as protagonist Frey is launched back in time. 


While gameplay is more of the same, Frey will be joined on her adventure by Tanta Cinta lending her abilities during combat and exploration. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Sony has released the debut trailer for the Gran Turismo movie.


The video, below, gives us a good idea of what to expect from the film, which is directed by District 9&#x27;s Neill Blomkamp and stars the sad cop from Stranger Things and the elf who notices they&#x27;re taking the hobbits to Isengard in Lord of the Rings. 


The Gran Turismo movie is about a Gran Turismo fan who enters a competition to become a professional racer. It&#x27;s based on a true story about Jann Mardenborough, who did just that in real-life.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered what Zelda&#x27;s Adventure would be like on Game Boy? Well, wonder no more, as one intrepid fan has taken one of the series&#x27; least well-received games and turned it into something that actually looks pretty great. 


Admittedly, Zelda&#x27;s Adventure is not exactly canon in the series&#x27; timeline. Developed by Viridis Corporation, it was published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i back in 1996. 


Despite featuring a playable Zelda (in Zelda&#x27;s Adventure, it is Link who has been whisked away by Ganon), the game was pretty poorly received by, well, everyone. Everything from its graphics to its acting came under fire, and even some of the most die hard Zelda fans have generally avoided it.

                              <span>The people behind Skywind have released an impressive new gameplay video.


Skywind is the ambitious mod project that rebuilds Bethesda&#x27;s much-loved 2002 role-playing game The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind in the Skyrim engine.


Work on Skywind has gone on for years now, but this latest video, below, shows the project is coming along nicely. It shows 20 minutes of new footage, including new world spaces, creatures, environment assets, voice lines, item descriptions, user interface improvements and spells, and revolves around a quest from the original game called Necromancer in Mawia.

                              <span>Dredge, the sinister fishing game from Black Salt Games and publisher Team 17, is about to get a lot less sinister (only for those who want it to, of course).


Thanks to an upcoming passive mode, those who simply want to take to the seas and bob around on the beautiful blue without having to worry about the denizens of the deep interrupting their serenity will be able to do just that. In short, when this free update goes live, &quot;monsters that usually attack fishing boats will no longer be aggressive&quot;. 


As well as this new feature, Dredge players can also expect a new photo mode (that comes with a new in-game character) and the addition of map markers in the future.

                              <span>Fortnite has launched a major new Star Wars crossover event timed to coincide with the franchise&#x27;s annual May 4th celebrations. 


The event focuses on the Star Wars saga&#x27;s Prequel trilogy, and features numerous free and paid-for skins to let you play as Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala, Darth Maul and a battalion of Clone Troopers.


This collaboration also sees Fortnite debut a premium mini battle pass for the first time, offering access to some of the above skins as rewards for completing in-game challenges.

                              <span>EA has started releasing the first of its many promised post-launch patches for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. 


Following a fairly glitchy release - particularly on PC - and an initial day one update, EA is now in the process of fixing its game. (Digital Foundry went so far as to call Star Wars Jedi: Survivor  &quot;the worst triple-A PC port of 2023 so far&quot;.)  PC players will likely have already noticed a new patch, while those on consoles can expect to see this wave of fixes going live at some point today (2nd May).


 EA says this particular patch will fix multiple crashes, including those tied to skipping cinematics. It will also address various collision issues within the game, and enemy AI should no longer T-pose when players take a spin with Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s photo mode.

                              <span>NetherRealm has released what looks like the first tease for the upcoming Mortal Kombat 12.


At the end of a video, below, in which Mortal Kombat developers thank fans for their support over the past 30 years, is a brief clip showing what looks like grains of sand falling from an hourglass. One of these grains of sand, perhaps the last, explodes.


What does it mean? As you&#x27;d expect, Mortal Kombat fans are having their say. The consensus is the tease relates to Kronika&#x27;s Hourglass. Kronika, the antagonist of Mortal Kombat 11 and the self-styled Keeper of Time and Architect of History, used the Hourglass to alter time and space, which led to the fun interactions between young and old versions of the same character in Mortal Kombat 11.

The update is available already to Xbox owners in the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead test rings, and will filter out to everyone else in the coming days. 


I have the new version myself, and it&#x27;s a real upgrade. Not only is there more room to see your background, the number of game and app tiles immediately available has also been increased.

The list includes indie action hit My Friend Pedro and cosy tile-based city-builder Before We Leave, as well as popular high school murder adventure series Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair Anniversary Edition. Goodbye despair, indeed.


First-person photography game Umurangi Generation is also getting the chop, so enjoy its retro future while you can.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch blockbuster The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been ripped and uploaded to the internet, with pirated copies now passed around, and extensive sections of footage streamed and uploaded.


Yesterday, Twitch and Discord streams showing footage of the game were available to view, two weeks ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch date, before eventually being pulled offline.


It&#x27;s unclar where the leak originated, or how many copies have been made available. But while a small number of physical copies appearing in the wild may be a headache for Nintendo, the fact the game has been pirated to share and play on PC is much more of a nightmare.

We are going to need to migrate to quantum-resistant public-key algorithms, and the sooner we implement key agility the easier it will be to do so.

Kubernetes 1.20 introduced the ContainerResource type metric
in HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA).
In Kubernetes 1.27, this feature moves to beta and the corresponding feature gate (HPAContainerMetrics) gets enabled by default.
What is the ContainerResource type metric
The ContainerResource type metric allows us to configure the autoscaling based on resource usage of individual containers.
In the following example, the HPA controller scales the target
so that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is around 60%.
(See the algorithm details
to know how the desired replica number is calculated exactly)
type: ContainerResource
containerResource:
 name: cpu
 container: application
 target:
 type: Utilization

                              <span>Apex Legends: Arsenal, the 17th season of the ever popular battle royale, will land on Tuesday, 9th May. Alongside map changes, a new mastery system, and evac towers, we&#x27;re being treated to a brand new Legend to kick this season off with a bang.
August &quot;Ballistic&quot; Brinkman is a veteran of the Thunderdome Games, the predecessor to the Apex Games we know today.  After a tragedy, Ballistic retired and disappeared from public view. Until now, that is, with Ballistic back and ready to show the younger generation of Legends just how it&#x27;s done.
Ballistic&#x27;s abilities are well suited to both ranged and close quarters combat in any mode you choose to play. However, he truly shines at singling out a target and taking them out in a stylish manner. His passive &#x27;The Sling&#x27; allows him to carry a third weapon but only with its base statistics. This means no attachments or upgrades, if you put a purple tier weapon in, it will instantly become its base tier. His tactical &#x27;Whistler&#x27; can overheat enemy weapons, and his ultimate &#x27;Tempest&#x27; buffs not only him but his entire team with infinite ammunition for a period of time.

                              <span>Meta is gearing up for another VR-focused Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, this time promising over 40 minutes of announcements, first looks, and updates on 1st June.


The main event gets underway at 6pm in the UK/10am PT on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and, inevitably, Horizon Worlds, but Meta is also holding a pre-show starting 15 minutes earlier that, it says, will feature &quot;game updates and debut trailers&quot;.


Once the pre-amble is out the way, Oculus Studios executive producer Ruth Bram will take the stage to present Meta Quest&#x27;s big announcements, and that&#x27;ll be followed by a post-show developer roundtable, promising a &quot;deep-dive conversation around some upcoming games&quot;.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor players have encountered another irritating bug – and this one steals your XP.

Many of you may have already come across the enemy Mogu, a big space troll thing that packs a punch. Trouble is, it turns out that the troll hits so hard, in some cases it smashes your XP clean off – or into – the map so that you can&#x27;t recover it.  

In a reddit post entitled &quot;don&#x27;t die to this troll, he eats your XP&quot;, u/slaymaker1907 reports that there &quot;seems to be a bug where if you die to this very particular troll, you can&#x27;t get your XP back&quot;.

Wudijo captured their first impressions when they recorded the unboxing – which was delivered in a box clearly marked &quot;do not ship before 1 June 2023&quot; – and shared it on their YouTube channel.

                              <span>PC Call of Duty players have set up a petition in a bid to convince Activision and Infinity Ward to &quot;resolve the issues introduced by season three&quot;.

Issues first began to pop up shortly after the update was rolled out, and despite tweets and messages from developer Infinity Ward assuring players that it was &quot;investigating&quot;, the problems still persist for some.

The issue has primarily been affecting players with AMD Vega GPUs and other Vega hardware, resulting in almost immediate crashes for PC players trying to access either Modern Warfare 2 or Warzone 2.0.

The team says that &quot;the Lumen, Ray Tracing, and Niagara effects&quot; help &quot;create visuals and effects that are beyond words and feel lifelike&quot;.

The new trailer follows an 11-minute video that dropped last month which also showed off the gameplay changes and new visuals.

We already knew the Super Mario Bros. Movie was doing alright for itself, and that it&#x27;s now officially the highest grossing film of 2023 so far and the biggest video game adaptation of all time, but if it does hit that milestone later today, it will only be the 10th animated movie to do so.

That&#x27;s according to The Hollywood Reporter, which says the North American projected weekend gross for the movie is $37.5 million for a domestic tally of $487.5 million through Sunday.

                              <span>A Star Wars Jedi: Survivor player is warning others of a &quot;major game-breaking bug&quot; that can prevent progress.

If you pass a certain point early in the game – usually within the first two to three hours, although this depends upon how quickly you&#x27;re trying to get through the story, of course – and die before you save, you risk respawning into a trapped location, effectively blocking your progress.

Like the OP, it&#x27;s not possible to warn you of the issue without at least spoiling a couple of non-story things, so proceed with caution if you&#x27;re anxious to play without any spoilers whatsoever.

&quot;It has come to our attention that some users have been accessing the Street Fighter 6 Closed Beta Test (CBT) software and playing the game outside of the designated period,&quot; the statement begins.

                              <span>US ratings board ESRB has revealed a new Tomb Raider collection is on the way to Switch.

Whilst the games included in the collection have not been named, it&#x27;s likely they are spin-offs Guardian of Light and Temple of Osiris, as the Switch port for those titles was quietly delayed at the end of last year.

&quot;This is a collection of two action-adventure games in which players help Lara Croft and her allies search for artifacts to stop ancient gods from destroying the world,&quot; the rating&#x27;s description explains, again without specifically confirming what the two games are called.

In an interview Barron&#x27;s and spotted by PC Gamer, Zampella acknowledged that whilst the studio didn&#x27;t have &quot;exact dedicated plans&quot; and was not &quot;working on anything currently&quot; connected to a new Titanfall game, &quot;it&#x27;s such a beloved franchise for the gams and also for [Respawn developers]&quot;.

&quot;I hate to say yes, then people latch onto that, and then skewer you when it doesn&#x27;t come,&quot; Zampella said. &quot;But I would love to see it happen is the real answer.

                              <span>As Star Wars Jedi: Survivor continues to rack up negative reviews on Steam for its PC performance issues, EA has released a statement to purchasers saying it&#x27;s &quot;aware [the game] isn&#x27;t performing to our standards&quot; and insisting it&#x27;s &quot;committed to fixing these issues&quot;.


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor recieved a favourable critical reception earlier this week - Eurogamer called it &quot;really fun&quot; despite a &quot;lack of focus&quot; - but reports of serious PC performance problems soon emerged following today&#x27;s launch. Currently, the game has a &quot;mostly negative&quot; rating on Steam, with users highlighting poor frame rates, crashes, and more.


Prior to launch, EA had already promised players it would be deploying patches over the next few weeks to fix bugs, improve performance, and expand on accessibility features - hardly an encouraging start for customers expected to pay up to £70 for the game - but now the publisher has addressed Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s reported PC flaws in more direct terms.

                              <span>One day after word of its US air date began to circulate, Sony&#x27;s Twisted Metal live-action television series has received its first trailer.


More accurately, today&#x27;s first look is being described as an &quot;official teaser&quot;, which probably does a better job of managing your expectations. It&#x27;s short on action - and pretty much anything at all you might think of when you hear the words &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; - but it does introduce Anthony Mackie in his starring role.


Mackie, you might recall, plays a &quot;motor-mouthed outsider&quot; who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life, as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland. We don&#x27;t get to see much of that in today&#x27;s teaser, but there is a vaguely amusing musical bait-and-switch, a bit of aerial footage, and thankfully - given the video game series&#x27; vehicular combat roots - at least one shot of a car with some guns stuck to the front.

                              <span>Lego has unveiled four Donkey Kong sets heading to its Lego Super Mario range this August.


Today&#x27;s reveal follows the tease earlier this week that Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong, and Funky Kong would all be getting the Lego treatment, with Lego now confirming three of those characters will receive their own sets.


First up is the £57.99/€64.99/$59.99 USD Donkey Kong&#x27;s Tree House Expansion Set, weighing in at 555 pieces. Alongside a Lego DK figure and his iconic homestead, this set features palm trees, a buildable TV, radio, and secret compartment, plus a Cranky Kong figure.

                              <span>A Vampire Survivors animated TV series is in the works.

Deadline reports the indie hit is set for a TV adaptation courtesy of Story Kitchen, which is working with Vampire Survivors creator Luca &quot;Poncle&quot; Galante.


In Vampire Survivors you move a pixelly character around a simple top-downish environment that steadily fills with enemies. Your character attacks automatically so you just wander around, avoiding directly connecting with enemies while putting them within damage range. Enemies drop experience orbs when they die for you to collect, and when you level up you get to spend your experience on a random choice of new attacks or perks or buffs.

Australian twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou are in final negotiations to direct the live-action adaptation of the famous fighting game franchise, according to Hollywood Reporter.


We don&#x27;t know anything about the movie yet, although Hollywood Reporter speculates that if the up-and-coming Philippous are being hired off the back of Talk to Me (trailer below), &quot;tension and gore may be on the agenda.&quot; Perhaps we&#x27;ll see Ryu split Sagat&#x27;s chest open with a Dragon Punch?

It&#x27;s a question Xbox boss Phil Spencer reportedly answered to staff at an all-hands meeting on Thursday, according to Bloomberg (paywall).


According to Bloomberg, Spencer stressed Microsoft remains committed to getting the deal over the line while acknowledging the damaging impact of this week&#x27;s events. The company, alongside Activision Blizzard, plans to appeal.

Over on Steam, the game currently sits with a &quot;mostly negative&quot; reception, with many lamenting its poor performance. At the time of writing, only 34 percent of Steam reviews for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor are positive. 


&quot;Runs like my ass after Taco Bell,&quot; wrote one player, and they are far from alone with this sentiment (although, so far at least, alone with that particular wording).

                              <span>Hey there! I&#x27;m so excited to be saying hello today as Eurogamer&#x27;s new editor - just typing these words feels something like a dream. 


(A good dream? Absolutely. Though also one where you check everything&#x27;s still on before standing in front of the class.)


Needless to say, everything about this feels a huge honour and oppurtunity. After 13 years here writing puns and making sure everyone puts the accent on Pokémon, there&#x27;s little else other than Eurogamer I care about so deeply.

                              <span>Valve has released a new update for its Steam Client Beta. 


This update adds a swathe of pretty nifty features and improvements, including the ability to pin windows from the overlay, so they appear on top of the game while in-game. This means that, in Valve&#x27;s words, &quot;yes, you can watch movies while you play games if you really want to&quot; (although, I think it really meant this feature to be more for things like guides and notes). 


As for those notes, this update adds a Notes app. The app does pretty much everything you would expect it to. It lets you take down notes about your game, and comes with &quot;rich text formatting, the ability to have multiple notes per game, and can even be used in offline mode&quot;. Your notes will be saved per game, and are then synced to other PCs that you are logged into.

&quot;The most accessible Forza Motorsport ever,&quot; reads a tweet shared by Xbox, including a video of accessibility consultant Brandon Cole using the new assists.


&quot;This is bringing the AAA racing genre to the blind community to the fullest,&quot; said Cole in the video.

                              <span>Honkai: Star Rail, the latest game from Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse, has already been downloaded more than 20m times.


Needless to say, this is an enormously impressive figure considering the game only came out two days ago, even if it is free to download.


The game has broken records by reaching the number one spot on the iOS game download chart in more countries than any game that has come before, as noted by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad.

That&#x27;s a record high for this specific quarter for sales of any console in history. The equivalent sales of the console last year were 2m units. By further comparison, the PS4&#x27;s biggest Q4 sales were 3m units.


Added to last quarter&#x27;s 7.1m units and it&#x27;s clear that PlayStation 5 sales are very much on an upward trajectory following stock shortages since launch.

Earlier this week, the UK stopped Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn effort to buy Activision in its tracks, prompting a furious response from Smith, who branded the move as &quot;bad for Britain&quot;.


&quot;Those sorts of claims are not borne out by the facts,&quot; a spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said last night (via Reuters).

                              <span>In its ongoing bid to acquire Activision Blizzard - something that saw a major set back earlier this week, after UK regulators dramatically blocked the deal -  Microsoft has announced yet another 10-year commitment. 


This latest deal is with cloud gaming platform Nware. Sharing the news on Twitter, Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote: &quot;Microsoft and European cloud gaming platform Nware have signed a 10-year agreement to stream PC games built by Xbox on its platform, as well as Activision Blizzard titles after the acquisition closes. 


&quot;While it&#x27;s still early for the emerging cloud segment in gaming, this new partnership combined with our other recent commitments will make more popular games available on more cloud game streaming services than they are today.&quot;

                              <span>Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition is readying to reach even further into the series&#x27; past with the announcement of its Return of Rome DLC, a &quot;new form&quot; of the original Age of Empires&#x27; Rise of Rome expansion that&#x27;s coming to PC and consoles on 16th May.


There&#x27;s quite a lot going on in Rise of Rome - which purchasers will need to switch to from the main screen in order to access its new stuff - but the most notable addition for series fans is arguably the return of all 16 civilisations from the original Age of Empires and Rise of Rome.


That means the Assyrians, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Choson, Egyptians, Greeks, Hittites, Macedonians, Minoans, Palmyrans, Persians, Phoenicians, Romans, Shang, Sumerians, and Yamato will all be playable in Rise of Rome, with the Romans being unique in that they&#x27;ll also be available to play in Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition&#x27;s base game.

                              <span>Arkane&#x27;s co-op vampire shooter Redfall is just a week away now, and as the clock ticks down to release, Microsoft has shared a bunch of new info, including a new trailer, details on its accessibility options, and its PC system requirements - the latter being particularly intriguing in light of the recently announced 30fps limit on consoles.


Starting with Redfall&#x27;s accessibility options, these have now been shared as part of a full &quot;settings&quot; breakdown over on Arkane&#x27;s blog. Accessbility options, specifically, include the likes of text-to-speech and speech-to-text support, screen narration, subtitles and closed captioning, font scaling, a colour blindness filter, notification duration settings, and an optional &quot;accessibility reticule&quot; for anyone that would benefit from a permanent fixation point on-screen.


Arkane has also provided an extensive list of more general settings, highlighting things like toggleable head bob and camera shake, optional object highlights, and four difficulty settings - three of which are available when first starting the game. It&#x27;s well worth checking out the full article for the considerably more expanded breakdown.

                              <span>Warner Bros&#x27; co-op action-adventure Gotham Knights has just received another update, this one bringing fixes, accessibility improvements, and a surprise new 15-floor Heroic Assault raid.


Gotham Knights, of course, recieved a lukewarm reception when it launched last October, with particularly stern words being saved for its myriad technical issues. Since then, developer Warner Bros Montreal has been tinkering under the hood to improve the experience - with notable success, as Digital Foundry noted recently - making today&#x27;s update the latest in a long line of patches.


With most of the game&#x27;s glaring technical issues seemingly now resolved, its latest update - which notably features accessibility improvements such as controller remapping, improved screen-reader support, and button press toggles, as detailed in the accompanying patch notes - is less about fixes and more about new content.

                              <span>A little over two years after first details emerged, the Twisted Metal live-action TV series has a US air date, with its premiere now set for 27th July.


This 10 half-hour-long episode adaptation of the primarily PlayStation-exclusive vehicular combat series - which, slightly alarmingly, is now approaching its 30th anniversary - tells the story of a motor-mouthed outsider (played by Anthony Mackie) who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life, as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland.


Sony first touted turning Twisted Metal into a television show back in 2019, but it wasn&#x27;t until 2021 that the wheels officially got in motion. Since then, US subscription service Peacock has placed an order for the action comedy, while Cobra Kai&#x27;s Michael Jonathan Smith has signed up as showrunner and to pen the scripts - which are based on a concept by Zombieland and Deadpool writing duo Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.

                              <span>Point and click puzzle game The Case of the Golden Idol will receive a new expansion next month. 


On 4th May, players will be able to head into the game&#x27;s The Spider of Lanka expansion, in a bid to puzzle out just what exactly is going on across three new scenarios. This expansion will be in a completely new setting. In fact, so new, it is all taking place &quot;thousands of miles from the rainy hills of Blackfield.&quot;


The Spider of Lanka kicks off a year before The Case of the Golden Idol&#x27;s first scenario, and follows the story of Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller as they make their maiden voyage to the Kingdom of Lanka. Here, they will visit... actually, I can&#x27;t tell you that. In the true spirit of The Case of the Golden Idol, that information has been redacted. I can share this trailer with you though, so please do sit back and enjoy.

They&#x27;re everywhere in the Soulsborne games: loved by Miyazaki and hated by players. We even rated them all.

As Matt reported on Monday, this union - which calls itself the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega, or AEGIS-CWA for short - aims to secure higher base pay, improved benefits, and a number of other goals.


In response, Sega of America&#x27;s president and COO Ian Curran wrote a letter to all employees, addressing the formation of AEGIS.

However, one of his more recent posts has caused quite a stir from his followers. Earlier today, the Metal Gear creator shared a picture of himself standing beside Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud (there was also a Kojima Productions mascot there).


For a bit of background, Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud is president of the Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS) and the Arab eSports Federation. He is also vice president of the Global Esports Federation.

                              <span>The number of people playing Activision Blizzard games each month has dropped back down to levels previously seen last summer, before a brief boost bestowed by big releases such as Overwatch 2 and Call of Duty in the back half of last year.


Monthly active users for Activision games - primarily its Call of Duty series - fell to 98 million as of the 31st March, down from 111 million at the end of December 2022. 


It&#x27;s a figure roughly equal to that seen at the end of September last year, before the arrival of Modern Warfare 2 and the big 2.0 relaunch of live service Warzone in November.

In an interview with the BBC, Microsoft president Brad Smith said yesterday was &quot;probably the darkest day in our four decades in Britain&quot;.


&quot;It does more than shake our confidence in the future of the opportunity to grow a technology business in Britain than we&#x27;ve ever confronted before.&quot;

Along with a now customary day one patch, the team at EA has additionally stated it will be releasing several more patches for the game in the &quot;weeks ahead&quot;, begging the question - is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor actually ready for launch? 


In a brief update, EA said players can expect patches that will fix bugs, improve the game&#x27;s performance and add more accessibility features in the weeks following Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s launch.


The language used by EA and early reports from some reviewers have left some fans wondering whether the game needed longer before launch, rather than arriving with issues that need to be subsequently ironed out.

Developer Colossal Order announced this expansion would be the last for Cities: Skylines, after eight years of post-launch content, as it continues to work on a sequel set for release later this year.

However, outside of Japan there&#x27;s simply a bundle with the game, minus the fancy themed hardware.

As you may recall, The Last of Us Part 1 finally launched for PC at the end of March after a 25-day delay designed to ensure it would debut &quot;in the best shape possible.&quot; Unfortunately, the reality of the release didn&#x27;t live up to that promise, and PC purchasers on Steam quickly began reporting a host of technical issues, including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - earning the port a Mostly Negative rating.


Since then, Naughty Dog has released three patches aimed at addressing the PC port&#x27;s various problems, and those fixes have slowly helped nudge The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s Steam rating up to a marginally less disastrous Mixed. And today&#x27;s 1.0.4 update aims to improve matters further, bringing an extensive list of changes focused around &quot;framerate optimisation, graphical and texture fidelity, crash fixes, and more&quot;.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bunch of activity going on around developer Amplitude&#x27;s sprawling historical 4X strategy game Humankind right now, and as part of all that, its newly released Para Bellum Wonder Pack DLC is currently free to claim and keep, but only for a limited time.


The Para Bellum Wonder Pack adds a total of six new cultural wonders, one for each of the game&#x27;s successive eras. The Stables of Pi-Ramesses are available first in Era 1 and are followed by the Colosseum, the Citadel of Alamut, the Hôtel des Invalides, Whilelmshaven Werft, and, as we step into the modern era, the Pentagon.


As you might imagine, each Wonder brings various benefits to the empires that build them, ranging from increased land movement speed and reduced cavalry/land vehicle upkeep for the Stables of Pi-Ramesses through to increased district fortication and bombardment benefits via the Pentagon. A full breakdown of these bonuses can be found in Amplitude&#x27;s announcement.

                              <span>Pokémon Go will hold its first-ever Go Fest event in the UK this summer, with a three-day bonanza centred in London&#x27;s Brockwell Park.


Go Fest 2023 in London will run from Friday 4th to Sunday 6th August, with early bird tickets on sale now (for £27). As with last year&#x27;s Seattle Go Fest, each day will be split with a half-day in the park, and the rest of the day spent exploring the local area - this time, with bonuses available throughout Greater London.


A version based in Osaka, Japan will run over the same dates, while New York has been chosen to host the event&#x27;s USA leg on 18th to 20th August.

                              <span>Stanford and Georgetown have a new report on the security risks of AI—particularly adversarial machine learning—based on a workshop they held on the topic.
Jim Dempsey, one of the workshop organizers, wrote a  blog post on the report:
As a first step, our report recommends the inclusion of AI security concerns within the cybersecurity programs of developers and users. The understanding of how to secure AI systems, we concluded, lags far behind their widespread adoption. Many AI products are deployed without institutions fully understanding the security risks they pose. Organizations building or deploying AI models should incorporate AI concerns into their cybersecurity functions using a risk management framework that addresses security throughout the AI system life cycle. It will be necessary to grapple with the ways in which AI vulnerabilities are different from traditional cybersecurity bugs, but the starting point is to assume that AI security is a subset of cybersecurity and to begin applying vulnerability management practices to AI-based features.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we discuss the fallout from today&#x27;s dramatic decision by the UK to block Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal, and whether an appeal could still turn things around. 

With the UK regulator issuing a stern warning over how it sees the deal impacting competitiveness among cloud gaming companies, it remains to be seen how much more Microsoft could do to reassure the UK without structurally changing the deal. Or does, perhaps, Microsoft say the UK should not have given up on this so easily, by saying a block on the deal was simply the most straightforward option?
So, do we think an appeal could still succeed? And what will it take? Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been seven months since the last instalment of developer Jupiter&#x27;s mighty Picross puzzle series on Switch, meaning there are probably a fair few fans in need of a fresh fix right about now. Luckily, help is on the way, with Picross S9 officially launching tomorrow, 27th April.


This ninth mainline series entry on Switch introduces a grand total of 485 new puzzles, so plenty of fresh deductive, dot-plopping column action to be getting on with. 300 of those are Picross and Mega Picross puzzles, 150 are Clip Picross, 30 are Colour Picross, and the remaining five are Extra puzzles - three of which will require you to link play data from Picross S6, S7, and S8.


Additionally, the local co-op mode introduced in Picross&#x27; previous instalment makes a return in S9, meaning up to four players can work together to solve its new conundrums.

Continuing the push for Donkey Kong seen in Nintendo&#x27;s theme parks (and, rumours suggest, perhaps also next on the big screen) are a range of Lego Super Mario sets featuring the ape and his many pals. 


Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong and Funky Kong all pop up in a quick teaser posted by Lego to Twitter this afternoon. It remains to be seen how many extra sets you&#x27;ll need to buy to collect them all.

                              <span>Trombone Champ developer Holy Wow has added a brand new, incredibly difficult track: Flight of the Bumblebee.


The piece, for you music nerds, was composed by Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov as an interlude for his opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan (composed from 1899-1900). It&#x27;s a notoriously tricky piece full of fast, buzzing melodies.


Thankfully, this latest update to the game also adds in a Practice Mode so players can reduce the speed by up to 50 percent. Phew!

Nintendo&#x27;s appearance at Gamescom suggests it will have something meaningful to show there. But what? The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4 will both have been released by the time Gamescom opens in late August. Could Nintendo have something hardware related to unveil to the world?


With the all-conquering Nintendo Switch in its sixth year of life, it certainly feels about time the Japanese company at least talked about what&#x27;s next.

                              <span>Microsoft has said it will appeal today&#x27;s shock decision by UK regulators to block its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition - but how will this work, and could it still be a success?


Appealing today&#x27;s decision will be a lengthy process for Microsoft, and hamper any chance of the deal being approved globally for months - and that&#x27;s without the separate decisions still due from the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU&#x27;s European Commission, both of which are still scrutinising the deal for themselves.


&quot;According to the Competition Appeal Tribunal site, straightforward cases are aimed to be dealt with within nine months,&quot; games industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told Eurogamer today. &quot;If the appeal is successful it is then returned to the CMA to review. This again will take some time.

In an internal email, published publicly, Kotick stated the result &quot;isn&#x27;t the news we wanted - but it is far from the final word on this deal&quot;.


He also confirmed that the decision will be contested, alongside Microsoft. &quot;We&#x27;re confident in our case because the facts are on our side: this deal is good for competition,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Indie game developer Young Horses has released four of its games for free, each of which is available on Steam right now.  


Young horses is perhaps best known for Bugsnax, a game that tasks players with finding and capturing the eponymous half-bug-half-snack creatures on a mysterious island, and Octodad, which sees players taking on the role of an octopus posing as a human man with a normal, human family (something that is easier said than done!).


You can expect more of the teams&#x27; eclectic flair in this latest offering of new and older games. Young Horses has released IndependANT, Antbassador, Snakedate and Octodad: Student Edition under its &quot;Free Range initiative&quot;. While the developer calls these releases &quot;smaller side projects&quot;, each of them looks like a lot of fun to while away some time.

The decision by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority prevents Microsoft from buying the publisher behind Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, follows earlier concerns it would lead to an unfair impact on archrival PlayStation. 

Instead, today&#x27;s decision stems from the CMA&#x27;s concerns over the deal&#x27;s proposed impact on the cloud gaming sector. In today&#x27;s final report, the CMA said Microsoft&#x27;s ownership of Activision Blizzard risked &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;. In response, Microsoft has said it will now appeal.

                              <span>Later today, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is set to give its verdict on Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


While this may give a strong indication as to whether the merger is approved globally, the US Federal Trade Commision (FTC) still has the hearing for its complaint to stop the merger filed back in December. That&#x27;s set for 2nd August, after Microsoft&#x27;s 18th July merger deadline expires.



As such, Microsoft is planning a swift end to the FTC&#x27;s deal concerns, reports the New York Post.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s gaming revenue fell four percent and Xbox hardware revenue declined 30 percent in the latest financial quarter, the company has reported.


While Microsoft does not report console sales and did not provide an updated number for Game Pass subscribers (it had 25m as of January 2022), it&#x27;s clear the company is struggling to sell Xbox consoles. In fact Xbox console sales have struggled for some time. Xbox Series X and S sales were down during the crucial holiday quarter last year, and it looks like they were down in the quarter ending 31st March this year, too.


The only bright spot for Microsoft was a slight three percent increase in Xbox content and services revenue. The company said this was &quot;driven by better-than-expected monetisation in third-party and first-party content, and growth in Xbox Game Pass&quot;.

Today&#x27;s update expands on each region&#x27;s previous renditions with new aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and digital elevation modelling data, including an updated height field for Hawaii and a version of Honolulu city introducing &quot;dozens&quot; of handmade buildings.

                              <span>It barely seems like yesterday, developer Rusty Lake was wowing us with its wonderfully inventive co-operative puzzler The Past Within, but now the studio is back to announced its next adventure, Undergound Blossom, coming later this year.


To date, Rusty Lake has released 16 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - blending casual point-and-click puzzling and room-escape-style conundrums into a wonderfully sinister, narratively intertwined saga charting the lives of the Vanderboom family.


As with developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s last few titles, the newly announced Underground Blossom ditches the Rusty Lake moniker but is still very much set in its sprawling universe, this time taking players on a journey via the Rusty Lake underground system through the life and memories of Laura Vanderboom - first introducd all the way back in Cube Escape: Seasons.

                              <span>There’s good reason to fear that A.I. systems like ChatGPT and GPT4 will harm democracy. Public debate may be overwhelmed by industrial quantities of autogenerated argument. People might fall down political rabbit holes, taken in by superficially convincing bullshit, or obsessed by folies à deux relationships with machine personalities that don’t really exist.
These risks may be the fallout of a world where businesses deploy poorly tested A.I. systems in a battle for market share, each hoping to establish a monopoly.
But dystopia isn’t the only possible future. A.I. could advance the public good, not private profit, and bolster democracy instead of undermining it. That would require an A.I. not under the control of a large tech monopoly, but rather developed by government and available to all citizens. This public option is within reach if we want it...</span>

                              <span>Obsidian&#x27;s pint-sized garden survival adventure Grounded is back with its big 1.2 update, this time adding the likes of wasps, a construction gnat (exactly what it sounds like), and Steam Deck verification, fixing some previously troublesome issues on Valve&#x27;s handheld.


Starting with Steam Deck verification, 1.2 remedies a range of problems, meaning initial loading and log-in should now function properly, prompts should no longer flicker between gamepad and mouse/keyboard controls, and the virtual keyboard should now correctly appear as needed. Obsidian has also optimised and tuned Grounded&#x27;s default graphics settings on Steam Deck for a more &quot;enjoyable experience&quot;.


Elsewhere, Grounded&#x27;s 1.2 update introduces new foes in the form of wasps, which can be found guarding their mini-hives around the yard or situated in more challenging Wasp Nests, where players can also encounter the new Wasp Queen boss. Defeating Grounded&#x27;s latest enemies will unlock new items to craft, including armour.

                              <span>Sega is readying itself for a summer of maraca-shaking mayhem it moves to bring its classic rhythm-action game Samba de Amigo to Switch - and ahead of its arrival, the publisher has revealed 20 of the 40 tracks it&#x27;ll be shipping with on launch day.


Samba de Amigo: Party Central, as Sega is calling this new Switch version, takes the infectious rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - which sees players following on-screen prompts to furiously shake their maracas in time with the music and in the desired position - but spices things up with a bunch of new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


Sega previously confirmed Party Central would feature 40 tracks at launch, but was a little vague about what they might be beyond a couple of Sonic the Hedgehog tunes. Now, though, it&#x27;s revealed 20 of the licensed tracks players can rhythmically flail to, with artists including Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepson, and Gloria Gaynor, plus some returning song favourites, such as Ricky Martin&#x27;s La Copa de la Vida and La Bamba.

There&#x27;s a release date too, with the series split into two volumes: the first will arrive on 29th June, the second will follow on 27th July. That&#x27;s a frequent occurrence on Netflix these days, so viewers can binge a few episodes but not the full season in one go.


Here&#x27;s that official teaser trailer:

Star Trek: Resurgence is a Telltale-style narrative game set shortly after the Star Trek: The Next Generation&#x27;s timeline (that&#x27;s the show with Picard, Riker and Troi etc). Here&#x27;s the official blurb:

&quot;A worker uprising threatens the tenuous peace between two alien civilisations, and Starfleet is forced to intervene. Players experience the conflict and larger mystery from two key perspectives. The U.S.S. RESOLUTE&#x27;s First Officer Jara Rydek is part of the diplomatic envoy led by Ambassador Spock that&#x27;s tasked with finding a resolution – and uncovering the ultimate source of this tense situation.

                              <span>After its initial reveal on April 1st this year, Asus is finally ready to shed more light on its ROG Ally handheld gaming PC, which launches on May 11th and will be sold by Currys in the UK. The Steam Deck competitor looks to be a more premium device than Valve&#x27;s offering, with a faster AMD Ryzen Z1 series processor, seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen and Windows 11 - but no price has yet been announced. 
The hardware side of the equation is perhaps the most fascinating, so let&#x27;s begin there. The Ally is powered by a &#x27;custom&#x27; Ryzen Z1 chipset that includes Zen 4 CPU cores and RDNA 3 graphics produced on a 4nm node. (By comparison, current Ryzen 7000 desktop designs use a mixture of 5nm and 6nm processes, which should give the Ally&#x27;s APU an advantage in terms of performance per watt.) We expect to see configurations of the device featuring the Z1 (6C/12T, 22MB cache, 2.8TF 4CU GPU) and Z1 Extreme (8C/16T, 24MB cache, 8.6TF 12CU GPU) processors announced by AMD earlier today, offering increasing levels of horsepower for a higher asking price. 
Speaking of which, the impressive-looking APU is backed with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode, while storage is up to a 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD and UHS-2 Micro SD card expansion - faster than what is available on the Deck, which is limited to PCIe 3.0 storage and UHS-1 Micro SD cards. Wi-Fi 6E is also included, in comparison to WiFi 5 on Steam Deck. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether all SKUs of the Ally come with the full complement of RAM and storage, or whether this will be pared back on the cheaper options.

                              <span>The ongoing feud between Blizzard and NetEase ramped up this week after reports out of China suggested NetEase had filed a lawsuit against the World of Warcraft maker demanding £35m.

Wowhead covered a report from Sina Technology that claimed NetEase has filed a lawsuit in Shanghai against Blizzard seeking ¥300 million in refunds for discontinued games and services to the over one million players it had in the region before servers were shut down in January.


World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm and the StarCraft series became unplayable in China on 24th January, when NetEase&#x27;s licence expired (mobile game Diablo Immortal was unaffected).

                              <span>We are just a mere few weeks away from Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s launch, and in anticipation Nintendo has released a new TV spot.


For those keeping track, this trailer is the finished product from last week&#x27;s leaked footage. Titled &quot;You can do what?!&quot;, the TV spot highlights some of Link&#x27;s new abilities, such as Fuse and Ultrahand. 


We can see Link creating a hovercraft of sorts to coast over the lands of Hyrule. Then, he battles a Flame Gleeok (essentially confirming the theory that we will be facing different varieties of Gleeok enemy in Tears of the Kingdom) with a fused shield and he uses his Ascend ability to pop up through an enemy camp. You can see the trailer for yourself below:

                              <span>Diablo 4 hardcore characters who die in PvP suffer permadeath, Blizzard has signalled.


Blizzard community director Adam Fletcher confirmed the feature in a tweet. It means that if your hardcore character dies in PvP, you will have to make a new character.


Diablo veterans will be familiar with the consequences of death when playing hardcore characters. Indeed, Blizzard has in the past warned Diablo players it is in no way responsible for their hardcore characters, and will not restore them under any circumstances.

Announced at the tail-end of 2021, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is being developed by Sumo Nottingham, sounds pretty par for the course amid the current crop of asymmetrical horror games like Dead by Daylight and Evil Dead: The Game.


It pits a brand-new cast of youthful &quot;victims&quot; against a single, powerful foe - in this case, a killer family member either plucked from or inspired by Tobe Hooper&#x27;s 1974 horror classic.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below.

Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s DLC Burning Shores released last week, with many praising its visuals and smooth gameplay performance. However, one plot point has led to the game being review bombed on Metacritic, where the DLC currently sits with a 3.2 user rating. Previously, Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores saw its user rating drop to as low as 2.7.

Copies of Respawn&#x27;s upcoming action sequel appeared to get into the hands of people four days before its 28th April release date - and of course story spoilers hit the internet soon after.

&quot;No spoilers!&quot; reads a tweet from the EA Star Wars account.

                              <span>A &quot;supermajority&quot; of employees at Sega of America have announced plans to unionise, with the aim of securing higher base pay, improved benefits, and a number of other goals.


This latest unionisation effort is being organised in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America labour union - which has previously assisted employees at the likes of Activision Blizzard King and ZeniMax Studios - and represents a broad selection of departments and disciplines at Sega&#x27;s  Irvine, California headquarters.


According to Axios, the group - which calls itself the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega, or AEGIS-CWA for short - consists of 144 employees with roles across marketing, localisation, product development, and quality assurance.

                              <span>The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a 2021 ruling on Epic Games&#x27; antitrust lawsuit against Apple, which both parties had appealed.


Epic launched its lawsuit against the iPhone maker in August 2020, following the company&#x27;s decision to revoke Epic&#x27;s Fortnite developer account, blocking the battle royale game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple&#x27;s 30 percent platform fees.


The following year, California&#x27;s Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. However, Gonzalez-Rogers did side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers linking out to alternative payment methods from within apps - a practice known as &quot;anti-steering&quot; - as that would constitute &quot;anti-competitive conduct&quot; under state law.

                              <span>It might have had a bit of a tumultuous development journey - to put it mildly - but Dead Island 2 is off to a flying start, having successfully shifted over 1m copies in its first three days of release.


Dead Island 2 finally launched last Friday, almost nine years after publisher Deep Silver announced it was in development. Since then, it&#x27;s seen no less than three studios at the helm, but, despite that rocky road to release, its final form - which reached the finish line under the stewardship of Dambuster Studios - has clearly captured the public&#x27;s imagination.


In its press release announcing Dead Island 2&#x27;s blast through the 1m sales barrier in just 72 hours, Deep Silver shared a selection of other notable stats. Over the course of those three days since launch, for instance, players have racked up 11m hours of play time, and 28m deaths.

Key Findings
Based on an analysis of samples shared with us by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, we developed indicators that enabled us to identify at least five civil society victims of QuaDream’s spyware and exploits in North America, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Victims include journalists, political opposition figures, and an NGO worker. We are not naming the victims at this time.
We also identify traces of a suspected iOS 14 zero-click exploit used to deploy QuaDream’s spyware. The exploit was deployed as a zero-day against iOS versions 14.4 and 14.4.2, and possibly other versions. The suspected exploit, which we call ...</span>

Since launching the Auto-refreshing Official CVE feed as an alpha
feature in the 1.25 release, we have made significant improvements and updates. We are excited to announce the release of the
beta version of the feed. This blog post will outline the feedback received, the changes made, and talk about how you can help
as we prepare to make this a stable feature in a future Kubernetes Release.
Feedback from end-users
SIG Security received some feedback from end-users:
The JSON CVE Feed did not comply
with the JSON Feed specification as its name would suggest.
The feed could also support RSS
in addition to JSON Feed format.

Here, we meet him taking a lonely stroll through his lavish mansion before settling down for a recap of his Thunderdome career, which ended tragically with the death of his teammate and brother-in-law.


Since then, Ballistic has become a recluse, neglecting his family until they chose to leave. Which is where Respawn&#x27;s cinematic switches back to the present, and when we - and Ballistic - learn his son, Nathaniel, has just qualified for the Apex Games.

                              <span>It looks like Lego is set to release a Pac-Man arcade machine model this summer. 


Images of the set have been making the rounds online, and while the pictures in question are admittedly very blurry, they appear to show the upper half of a Pac-Man cabinet. Along with the cabinet half itself, there also seem to be Lego models of Pac-Man and two small ghosts. 


While nothing has been officially announced, according to Lego leaker Falconbricks, this set will be released on 1st June and sell for $269.99 (so, around £217). Meanwhile, it is said to have 2651 pieces.

In a recent management update, Guerrilla announced that its studio director and executive producer Angie Smets was set to start a new role at PlayStation Studios, as head of development strategy.


Along with the customary words of appreciation for Smets&#x27; work at the company, Guerrilla also laid out the groundwork for its new look management team.

The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is one of three key regulators around the world still scrutinising Microsoft&#x27;s deal, alongside the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU&#x27;s European Commission. 


A final ruling by the CMA must arrive before the end of its deadline day - this Wednesday, 26th April - and Microsoft has recently had reason to hope its efforts to win over the UK authority will ultimately prove successful.

                              <span>Capcom has released a new patch for its Resident Evil 4 remake. 
This patch addresses a number of issues, and can generally be seen as a very good thing. After all, we all want our games to look and play as smooth as possible. 

If you are one of the many trying to speedrun your way through the game, I&#x27;m afraid this may now be a little harder, as this update has &#x27;fixed&#x27; the glitch that allowed players to warp through walls when using the scope in certain areas. This means no more shortcutting your way through doors. Welp!

                              <span>LawBreakers died back in 2018 - but its chief creator now wants it to come back.


LawBreakers was a hero shooter developed by Boss Key Productions, the now defunct studio set up by Cliff &quot;CliffyB&quot; Bleszinski after he left Epic having famously worked on the Unreal Tournament and Gears of War franchises.


Despite a big pre-release push by publisher Nexon, LawBreakers flopped, with its Steam concurrent player count peaking at 7482 in June 2017 when it launched via open beta. Nexon later blamed LawBreakers&#x27; disastrous fortunes on battle royale PUBG, which at the time was just about the biggest game in the world.

                              <span>Ubisoft has said it is unlikely to launch native PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2, as taking &quot;full advantage&quot; of the current console generation would also mean leaving players on PS4 and Xbox One behind.

The Division 2 originally launched back in March 2019, with versions for PS4, Xbox One and PC. Streaming versions for Google Stadia and Amazon Luna launched in 2020, and it is playable now on new consoles via backwards compatibility.

Last week, The Division 2&#x27;s fifth year of content was laid out for fans of Ubisoft&#x27;s ongoing post-pandemic co-op shooter. Speaking to MP1st, the game&#x27;s creative director Yannick Banchereau also discussed whether a ground-up PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version could also release - but it seems unlikely.

Bandai Namco released the gameplay video, below, that shows off Lili&#x27;s look in the upcoming fighting game.

The pampered Monégasque heiress makes the playable character cut complete with a Siamese cat named Salt. In the video, we see Lili square off against rival Asuka, who was confirmed for Tekken 8 a few weeks ago. In her new rage art, Lili counts to three while knocking lumps out of her opponent, before saying adieu with a somersault kick.

                              <span>In an open letter, seven secure messaging apps—including Signal and WhatsApp—point out that the UK’s Online Safety Bill could destroy end-to-end encryption:
As currently drafted, the Bill could break end-to-end encryption,opening the door to routine, general and indiscriminate surveillance of personal messages of friends, family members, employees, executives, journalists, human rights activists and even politicians themselves, which would fundamentally undermine everyone’s ability to communicate securely.
The Bill provides no explicit protection for encryption, and if implemented as written, could empower OFCOM to try to force the proactive scanning of private messages on end-to-end encrypted communication services – nullifying the purpose of end-to-end encryption as a result and compromising the privacy of all users...</span>

Before Kubernetes v1.8 (!), typos, mis-indentations or minor errors in
YAMLs could have catastrophic consequences (e.g. a typo like
forgetting the trailing s in replica: 1000 could cause an outage,
because the value would be ignored and missing, forcing a reset of
replicas back to 1). This was solved back then by fetching the OpenAPI
v2 in kubectl and using it to verify that fields were correct and
present before applying. Unfortunately, at that time, Custom Resource
Definitions didn’t exist, and the code was written under that
assumption. When CRDs were later introduced, the lack of flexibility
in the validation code forced some hard decisions in the way CRDs
exposed their schema, leaving us in a cycle of bad validation causing
bad O…</span>

                              <span>A Resident Evil 4 fan has made a real-life recreation of Leon Kennedy&#x27;s attache case to show how Leon&#x27;s items would &quot;scale in real life&quot;.

The recreation – which takes a screenshot of a late-game Kennedy loadout as its source – is fantastically faithful, including eggs, a &quot;fish&quot;, guns with their attachments, as well as ammo and health items, and suggests that in real life, the case that holds Leon&#x27;s inventory would be prohibtively enormous.

                              <span>It looks like physical copies of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will require an additional digital download to play.

Whilst there&#x27;s been no formal word from EA about the additional requirement, players who&#x27;ve spotted the physical game out in the wild have reportedly noticed that the boxed copies sport a sticker on the front that says &quot;download required&quot;.

This may not come as a surprise to some given EA recently published the minimum and recommended PC specifications for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which stated that Jedi Survivor takes up 155GB on PC, and discs can only hold so much data, of course.

The initiative – which &quot;instructs loved-ones to both zombie-proof the recently deceased and toast their passing with a blowout in Los Angeles before the city becomes the Hell-A we see in the game&quot; – is an insurance policy to provide &quot;a wake to end all wakes with nearest and dearest raising a Zombie cocktail during a celebratory Californian getaway&quot;.

                              <span>Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone recently shared a selection of very early sketches and ideas that eventually led to the creation of fan-favourite farming sim, Stardew Valley.

They include notes and annotations handwritten by Barone that intimate how he expected players to interact with the different characters and items in the game.

&quot;[I] was going through some things and found my old notebook with the original community centre concept,&quot; Barone tweeted, before sharing wonderful sketches taken from his original notebook.

The &quot;all-new&quot; Veiled Collection Event for Apex Legends: Revelry – which goes live on 25th April and runs until 9th May – not only introduces the requisite new cosmetic skin collection, but also a new limited-time team deathmatch mode Unshielded Deadeye, where &quot;Legends wield limited rotating loadouts&quot;. 

As the &quot;unshielded&quot; name suggests, players forego both helmets or shields and race to become the first to clock up 50 kills and &quot;prove themselves a Champion among Legends&quot;.

&quot;There’s been so much happening in the world of Wild Hearts recently,&quot; the team explains. &quot;We deployed a PC crash hotfix and a Claw Blade &amp; Bow Rebalance patch last week. So much to share and we haven’t even gotten to what&#x27;s in today&#x27;s content update!&quot;

&quot;Deathhaze Gloombeak soars into Akikure Canyon, along with a new title and a new talisman skill for those able to reach new heights as a hunter. Serial Hunts – a new kind of Special Quest – have also been added, and could very well be the most arduous challenge Azuma’s hunters have seen to date.&quot;

                              <span>Four more Ubisoft games are slated to join Steam later this year.

Far Cry 6, Riders Republic, Rainbow Six Extraction, and Monopoly Madness are set to come to the Steam store on 11th May, 8th June, 15th June, and 22nd June, respectively, marking the first time these titles will be playable on Steam.

Since 2019, Ubisoft had skipped bringing its game to Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12 per cent revenue cut compared to Valve&#x27;s 30 per cent.

                              <span>The Mortuary Assistant is now available on Nintendo Switch.

The smash-hit indie horror hit – which offers some genuinely unsettling moments in its 10ish hour run time over numerous playthroughs – doesn&#x27;t seem to boast any Switch-specific features, but it does mark the first time the chilling creeper is available outside of Steam.

&quot;Having completed your degree in mortuary sciences, you have taken on an apprenticeship at River Fields Mortuary. Over the past several months you have logged many hours aiding the Mortician in daily tasks along with learning the ins and outs of the embalming process as well as how to properly handle and care for the deceased,&quot; teases the description on the Nintendo Shop.

                              <span>Sons of the Forest roared out the gates when it launched into Steam early access back in February, and 2m+ copies sold later, developer Endnight Games is continuing to improve the experience, this time adding ducks, a lake to put them in, a double log buff for fan-favourite companion Kelvin, and a sad end for a levitating life jacket.


All this comes via Sons of the Forest&#x27;s patch #4, which, while fairly light on radical new features, brings a host of welcome quality of life improvements - including the aforementioned Kelvin buff meaning he can now carry a whopping two logs at once - plus tweaks, and more. 


There&#x27;s some new stuff on the feature front, though, including a new Action Cam used to view Sons of the Forest&#x27;s found footage tapes - the first of which is now in-game - plus new points of interest discovery laptops, and the ability to name save games.

                              <span>Developers Massive Monster&#x27;s entertaining dungeon-crawling management sim Cult of the Lamb is getting a massive free update next Monday, 24th April, introducing a new post-game storylie, &quot;deeper&quot; combat, new building options, and more.


There&#x27;s a lot going on in Relics of the Old Faith, as the update is known, starting with the introduction of Relics and heavy attacks as part of Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s improved combat. It also adds remixed dungeons featuring revamped enemies and bosses, including new versions of the base game&#x27;s four Guardian Bishops as confirmed during Nintendo&#x27;s indie showcase.


Away from the dungeon-crawling side of things, Massive Monster says the game&#x27;s cult management portion will get new followers, plus a range of new buildings - including a kitchen with its own chef for more efficient cooking, a (non-collapsing) shared shelter capable of housing up to three followers, a crypt to keep graveyard sizes under control, plus farm plot signs which followers can plant stuff around for better crop organisation.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced Victoria 3&#x27;s first paid expansion, a new &quot;immersion pack&quot; titled Voice of the People, which launches on 22nd May.


Voice of the People&#x27;s main new feature is introduction of ideological &quot;agitators&quot; from across history, including Victor Hugo and Karl Marx. Agitators are a new kind of character in Victoria 3, capable of rallying pops to support political movements that align with their ideology.


&quot;Agitators will shake up your internal politics, acting independently of their Interest Groups,&quot; Paradox explains in a blog post accompanying its DLC announcement. &quot;Amplifying power from below, Agitators serve an opposite function to Interest Group Petitions which reflect the demands of the political elite. Depending on how your goals align with theirs, Agitators might be a painful thorn in your side or a valuable ally to your political agenda.&quot;

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s Aaron Greenberg has insisted Tango Gameworks&#x27; Hi-Fi Rush was a &quot;break out hit&quot; amid claims the critically acclaimed music adventure &quot;just didn&#x27;t make the money it needed to make&quot;.


The claim Hi-Fi Rush had failed to meet Microsoft&#x27;s financial expectations was made by Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb during his latest Game Mess Decides podcast.

&quot;Based on what I&#x27;ve heard,&quot; Grubb said during a conversation about the game&#x27;s release strategy, &quot;it just straight up didn&#x27;t make the money it needed to make. I mean it got good reviews, the buzz was good, so where do you put the blame for something like that? Is it the price? Was it the shadow drop? Could it have sold more? Or is it Game Pass?&quot;.

                              <span>Darker and Darker&#x27;s lawyer has accused Korean gaming company Nexon of &quot;anti-competitive bully tactics&quot;, in a letter to Steam owner Valve. 


Following positive reception at Steam Next Fest earlier this year, Dark and Darker has experienced a troubled production. In March, developer Ironmace had its office searched, after Nexon alleged the studio created its game with code stolen from Nexon&#x27;s own &quot;P3&quot; project (something several members of Ironmace&#x27;s team had previously worked on). 


Soon after these allegations were made, Nexon issued Ironmace with a cease and desist demand, and Dark and Darker was removed from Steam. Most recently, it came to light that the Dark and Darker developer is being sued by Nexon for &quot;copyright infringement&quot;, with the Korean game publisher demanding a jury trial in America.

He added: &quot;DE&amp;I [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] also means diversity of thought, especially when it&#x27;s backed by data and financials&quot;.

                              <span>Valve has released a significant update to its MOBA Dota 2, called New Frontiers.


It expands the map and makes meaningful gameplay, matchmaking and user interface changes, among many other things.

While the core objectives of the game are the same, with lanes the same distance from each other and win objectives still in the centre of the map, there&#x27;s 40 percent more terrain, which means there&#x27;s loads of room to gather resources.

                              <span>Atari has whipped out its wallet and snapped up the intellectual property rights to over 100 retro games from the 80s and 90s, including Bubsy, Demolition Racer, and more.


Specifically, Atari&#x27;s new acquisitions span the PC and console game catalogues of publishers Micropose, Infogrames, Accolade, with Atari also now owning the Accolade trademark.


Sadly, the company hasn&#x27;t shared a full list of the retro IP it now owns after its most recent splurge, so there&#x27;ll be no time for lengthy bouts of nostalgia here - but its announcement did at least call out the aforementioned Bubsy and Demolition Racer, alongside Hardball, 1942: Pacific Air War, F-117A, and F-14 air combat series.

Firewalk was founded in 2018 as a subsidiary of ProbablyMonsters and is yet to release its first game. However, the studio announced a partnership with Sony in 2021 to create a new PlayStation-exclusive triple-A title focused on delivering &quot;memorable multiplayer moments&quot;.


In a PlayStation Blog post announcing the acquisition, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst explained it was Firewalk&#x27;s work on its still mysterious title - a project being headed by former Destiny creative director Ryan Ellis - that lead Sony to acquire the developer.

                              <span>Dazzlingly chaotic crowd puzzler Humanity, which is being developed by Tokyo game studio THA in collaboration Tetris Effect developer Enhance, will be tumbling onto PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC on 16th May, and it&#x27;ll be a day one PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue addition too.


Humanity, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, has been in development for a fair old while, with THA first showcasing the game back in 2017 before it re-emerged two years later with Enhance attached. It&#x27;s remained an intriguing proposition throughout its journey, challenging players - in the role of a Shiba Inu - to corral huge, purposeless crowds.


There&#x27;s a vague air of classic puzzler Lemmings about the whole thing as players let out a &quot;woof&quot; to control Humanity&#x27;s vast swarms, making the crowds move, change direction, jump, float, or even fight in order to navigate Trials packed with traps and obstacles, and overcome enemies known as the Others.

Originally announced in May 2021, Heartland has now been in closed testing for over a year already - but there&#x27;s evidently still more to be done before it gets a final launch date. 


Tonight, Ubisoft directed interested players and their parties to register for access (at thedivisionheartland.com) in a fresh round of testing, ahead of &quot;more news this summer&quot;.

                              <span>Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn has reportedly been heavily affected by the latest round of job cuts at Meta Quest and VR owner Meta, with one employee claiming a third of the studio has been laid off, including the studio head.


As originally reported by The Washington Post, today&#x27;s layoffs could affect as many as 4,000 employees at Meta, and are part of the company&#x27;s stated goal of cutting a further 10,000 jobs in 2023 following the 11,000 job losses announced last year.


The Washington Post claims Meta has targeted &quot;highly skilled staff&quot; - including engineers and other technical workers - in its latest round of layoffs, and, since its report, employees have said both Ready at Dawn and fellow Meta acquisition Downpour Interactive have been impacted.

Apple introduced the optional recovery key in 2020 to protect users from online hackers. Users who turn on the recovery key, a unique 28-digit code, must provide it when they want to reset their Apple ID password.
iPhone thieves with your passcode can flip on the recovery key and lock you out. And if you already have the recovery key enabled, they can easily generate a new one, which also locks you out.
Apple’s policy gives users virtually no way back into their accounts without that recovery key. For now, a stolen iPhone could mean devastating personal losses...</span>

Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature called Node log query that allows
viewing logs of services running on the node.
What problem does it solve?
Cluster administrators face issues when debugging malfunctioning services
running on the node. They usually have to SSH or RDP into the node to view the
logs of the service to debug the issue. The Node log query feature helps with
this scenario by allowing the cluster administrator to view the logs using
kubectl. This is especially useful with Windows nodes where you run into the
issue of the node going to the ready state but containers not coming up due to
CNI misconfigurations and other issues that are not easily identifiable by
looking at the Pod status.
How does it work?

                              <span>Spooky visual novel Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is steeped in Japanese history. When you&#x27;re not absorbing the sights of 1980s Tokyo or hearing ancient folk tales, Paranormasight feeds you bits of information about Japan during the wider Shōwa era and the earlier Edo period.


Whether from decades or centuries ago, elements of Japanese history are woven into the game, something which Paranormasight director and writer Takaya Ishiyama told me more about, in a discussion which revealed more about the team&#x27;s approach to using history in the game&#x27;s narrative as a way to balance realism and mystery.


One of the first things you notice when playing Paranormasight is the difference in visual style between the environments and the characters. The game&#x27;s cast were drawn by Kobayashi Gen, and his distinct style stands out from the surroundings in-game. The 360-degree panoramas you explore were all created from photographs, though this wasn&#x27;t initially what the team set out to do.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast it&#x27;s all about Zelda, and the many burning questions we still have surrounding the upcoming Tears of the Kingdom. 

Despite all the details to be found in Nintendo&#x27;s final Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, there&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know.  How much has changed in Hyrule since Breath of the Wild, and how many new areas are there to explore? Are there proper dungeons in the game this time around? What are the Tears of the Kingdom? 
With less than a month until launch, it&#x27;s time for one final round of theorising - as the internet begins to entertain some wild theories that Ganon is actually good, or maybe just pulling a Thanos. Joining me to discuss it all - and place bets on whether Zelda really is playable - are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Activision issued an update to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Warzone 2.0 and DMZ overnight that includes an interesting gameplay change the community reckons is a response to a backlash over pay-to-win bundles.


Last week, Season 3 of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 went live alongside a bundle that includes controversial &quot;bonus effects&quot; for the extraction mode, DMZ.

For example, the Classic Ghost Pack, which costs 2400 CP, includes a free two-plate armour vest, a 15-minute insured weapon cooldown for each of the two guns included in the bundle, and adds one more active duty operator slot for DMZ.

                              <span>Cast your minds back to October last year and you may recall footage doing the rounds of a self-proclaimed &quot;body cam-style&quot; game that looked almost too realistic to actually be real - if you know what I mean.


However, fast forward six months and we now have an official trailer for the game. It&#x27;s called Unrecord, and comes from a developer known simply as Drama.


Unrecord is described as a &quot;single-player FPS that tells the story of a tactical police officer from the perspective of his body camera&quot;. You can see how it looks for yourself below - and its realism makes for slightly uncomfortable viewing.

                              <span>For years, scans of Sugimori Ken&#x27;s original watercolour artwork of the first two generations of Pokémon species have circulated online. For the first time, high quality scans of the artwork are being shared with the Pokémon community in the hopes of archiving them.

The drawings depict the first 251 Pokémon to appear in the games and were uploaded by YouTuber and Pokémon archivist LewTwo to Twitter. The scans were sent to Lewtwo by Twitter user ExcaliburZero_Z.

The old scans are believed to have originated from the Pokémon Red and Blue Player&#x27;s Guide, Lewtwo explained, where they ended up with &quot;inaccurate colors, were often misshapen, and generally very low quality&quot;.

Please note, there are spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


During the events of Burning Shores, Aloy meets Seyka, an &quot;ambitious marine of the Quen tribe who has stepped up to help her people survive&quot;. Ahead of the DLC&#x27;s release, Seyka was touted as a character that would be Aloy&#x27;s equal, with actress Ashley Birch even saying &quot;Aloy may have met her match&quot;.

                              <span>Bungie is adding new accessibility options to Destiny 2, specifically for colour blindness.


Season of the Deep, out 23rd May, will include an option for players to amend the Enemy Targeted Reticle Colour that changes when aiming at an enemy, as well as new colour options for subtitles to ensure they&#x27;re easy to read.


Bungie is also adding colour presets for Commendations, meaning players with colour blindness can still clearly see rewards.

Sparking up players&#x27; attention is the title of this event&#x27;s new Special Research questline - &quot;Grass and Gratitude&quot; - which is available now alongside the game&#x27;s similarly grass-themed Sustainability Week.

                              <span>A Mario character who appears in the new Super Mario Bros. Movie will be re-named in Japan, Nintendo has confirmed. 


Mario and Luigi&#x27;s former boss Spike appears in the film as a stern foreman and rival for the brothers&#x27; new firm. The character is a deep cut from Mario canon, and originally appeared in the NES and arcade game Wrecking Crew back in the 1980s.


In Japan, Spike has always had the name &quot;Blackie&quot; - which for obvious reasons will no longer be used. Henceforth, the character will be re-named as &quot;Spike&quot; in any future appearances, and the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie will use &quot;Spike&quot; as well.

                              <span>Blizzard has teased a new Diablo 4 beta ahead of the action role-playing game&#x27;s 6th June launch.


Quote tweeting a Twitter user&#x27;s call for more Diablo 4 game time, the official Diablo Twitter account said: &quot;That can be arranged…&quot;


That&#x27;s a pretty clear tease that some surprise way to play Diablo 4 ahead of release is planned. Whether that&#x27;s a fresh open beta or early access remains to be seen. If you pre-order Diablo 4 you currently get early access from 2nd June, so this tweet suggests something even earlier.

                              <span>Epic Games has gripped another studio in a permanent money hug, this time acquiring Horizon Chase Turbo developer Aquiris to work on Fortnite.


The Brazil-based Aquiris was founded in 2007 and went on to develop the well-received Wonderbox: The Adventure Maker and Looney Tunes World of Mayhem for mobile, as well as its retro-inspired arcade racer Horizon Chase which released in 2015.


A much-expanded - and critically acclaimed - follow-up, Horizon Chase Turbo, arrived in 2018, whisking the series from mobile to PC and consoles, and Aquiris launched a third entry in the series, Horizon Chase 2, on Apple Arcade at the end of last year.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been quite some time since The Game Kitchen announced it was working on a sequel to its gorgeous, gothic action-platformer Blasphemous, but now - with a release pencilled in for &quot;late summer&quot; 2023 - we&#x27;ve been given a first trailer for Blasphemous 2.


The original Blasphemous released back in 2019 to well-deserved acclaim, delivering a rock-solid 2D Metroidvania-meets-Souls-like that married a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling baroque imagery.


In its upcoming sequel, Blasphemous&#x27; original pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One returns for another adventure - tying into the first game&#x27;s Wounds of Eventide update ending - set across a strange new labyrinthine land ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

Announced back in 2021 and initially expected to launch that same year, Oxenfree 2 is set five years after the memorable, dimension-shattering events of the original game. This time around, the story focuses on new protagonist Riley Poverly, an environmental researcher who returns to her small coastal hometown of Camena which, as you might already have guessed, is being plagued by mysterious radio signals.


Making matters worse, there&#x27;s a cult on the loose, attempting to open a portal between worlds, but Riley has some useful new tricks to help her investigations. A new walkie talkie, for instance, means communiucation can occur between characters all across Camena even when they&#x27;re not together, with conversation and dialogue choices affecting how events play out.

One interesting bit is that Apple’s Lockdown Mode (part of iOS 16) seems to have worked to prevent infection.

With the release of Kubernetes v1.27 the ReadWriteOncePod feature has graduated
to beta. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll take a closer look at this feature, what it
does, and how it has evolved in the beta release.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is a new access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.

                              <span>The Day Before developer Fntastic has re-emerged with news of a beta test for its highly-anticipated but held-up zombie MMO, ahead of a full release on 10th November. 


As a reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release in March, before its launch was delayed. In a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game&#x27;s name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam and since then, very little has been heard at all.


The Day Before has now reemerged, however, with word from an administrator on the game&#x27;s official Discord that a beta is now in the pipeline.

                              <span>Capcom has detailed the additions coming to Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak - including weather-manipulating elder dragon Amatsu - as part of the expansion&#x27;s free April update, and has confirmed there&#x27;ll be one final free update arriving in June.


Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Title Update 5 (also referred to as Version 15) launches tomorrow, 20th April, and its flagship new arrival is the Looming Calamity, better known as the elder dragon Amatsu. This formidable creature can control the weather, conjuring violent storms and lightning strikes once it shows its true power, and is available to hunters at MR 10 or higher.


Amatsu is accompanied by Title Update 5&#x27;s second creature addition, a powerful Risen variant Shagaru Magala, which becomes available at MR 180 or higher. As you&#x27;d expect, new equipment can be forged from the materials dropped by both creatures, including a fetching bit of Palamute outfit resembling floating armoured horse.

                              <span>A Pokémon fan has created an impressive HD-2D take on the series&#x27; original Game Boy games.


Several videos made by 3D pixel artist and designer Dott have surfaced in the past week, showing off what Pokémon Red might look like if reimagined in an HD-2D style similar to recent Square Enix titles like Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler. 


It&#x27;s a design which has sparked excitement from fans at how future Pokémon remakes could be made, after the rather lacklustre response to 2021&#x27;s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and more general gripes about the series&#x27; visuals in all-new entries.

So, here are some of the current Tears of the Kingdom theories out there. (Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.)

Thalassophobia is classed as the persistent and intense fear of deep bodies of water, including the sea, oceans and even lakes. It is different from aquaphobia, which is a fear of water itself.


According to Guerrilla, this option aims to ease a player&#x27;s thalassophobia by &quot;improving underwater ambient visibility&quot;. Additionally, Aloy will be able to breathe indefinitely when under the water &quot;regardless of story progression&quot;.

The exuberant Jack Black ballad, in character as Bowser, is a highight of the film, and the catchiest movie track since Encanto&#x27;s Bruno. I even heard it being chanted by the younger viewers around me as I left the cinema. 


It&#x27;s also now hit the US song charts as well, and has marked Black&#x27;s first solo entry in the Billboard Hot 100. On YouTube, meanwhile, the song&#x27;s music video has racked up 17m views in 11 days. Let&#x27;s watch:

                              <span>Ubisoft may extend the XDefiant closed beta over its &quot;horrible&quot; server experience.


Executive producer Mark Rubin took to Twitter to say Ubisoft will discuss the possibility of extending the closed beta, which is due to end on 23rd April.


Ubisoft has issued a raft of updates to the beta in a bid to improve the experience. My own time with the game on PlayStation 5 has been beset with technical issues that have forced me to restart in order to get a match. Ubisoft reacted to progression problems by unlocking everything for all players.

Capcom classic Street Fighter 2: Special Champion Edition leads the bunch, alongside Sega sidescroller Kid Chameleon. 


Sci-fi sidescroller Pulseman, an early project from Pokémon developer Game Freak, is also now available to try. It&#x27;s set in the &quot;far future of 2015&quot;, which I&#x27;d like to go back to.

Playdate was initially announced back in 2019, promising a unique (and dinkily adorable) spin on portable gaming that would see Panic teaming up with a host of noted indie game designers - including the likes of Zach Gage and Bennett Foddy - to produce a curated 24-game &quot;season&quot;, as well as offering itch.io sideloading support and, more recently, an on-device store.


It was a pitch that clearly captured peoples&#x27; imaginations; Panic has now revealed the initial 20,000 Playdate units it produced based on its early sales predictions sold out within 20 minutes of the device being made available to purchase via a queue system last April.

Proceedings are set to commence at 7pm BST/8pm CEST/11am PDT this Thursday via Twitch and YouTube, with Ubisoft promising news on three of its The Division games.


Up first is the still-popular The Division 2, which will share more on its upcoming rogue-like-inspired Descent mode, alongside details of its Year 5 plans. Ubisoft, you might recall, confirmed a fifth year of content would be happening last July.

The problem
On Linux with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled, it&#x27;s traditionally
the container runtime that applies SELinux labels to a Pod and all its volumes.
Kubernetes only passes the SELinux label from a Pod&#x27;s securityContext fields
to the container runtime.
The container runtime then recursively changes SELinux label on all files that
are visible to the Pod&#x27;s containers. This can be time-consuming if there are
many files on the volume, especially when the volume is on a remote filesystem.
Note
subPath of a volume, only that subPath of the whole
volume is relabeled. This allows two pods that have two different SELinux labels
to use the same volume, as long as they use different subpaths of it.

If a Pod does not have any SELinux label assigned in …</span>

                              <span>The two opposing forces of light and dark smash merrily together later this week as The Sims 4 turns its attention to extravagant greenhouse suntraps and grungy, dingy basements in two new Kit DLC packs, both arriving 20th April.


With spring now in full swing, green-fingered sorts will have the seasonally appropriate opporunity to fashion their own horticultural hangouts as part of The Sims 4&#x27;s new Greenhouse Haven Kit. This introduces glass pane windows and doors that can be connected to create new garden spaces, as well as a range of items to go inside - including hanging baskets, starter seedlings, a planting table, and range of pots.


Alternatively, for those who&#x27;d prefer to hide away from the sun&#x27;s rays in grungy comfort, there&#x27;s the Basement Treasures Kit, offering a selection of hand-me-down inspired furnishings. Expect the likes of worn and torn chairs and couches, crates of vinyl records, old trophies and family photos, battered chests, and  even an old cathode-ray tube TV.

Now, by run, I mean actual running. One foot in front of the other and all that. And to add that extra layer of adventure and excitement, the app &#x27;gamifies&#x27; your run by popping Marvel&#x27;s heroes in your ear as they join you via the app&#x27;s interactive stories. That said, you can also walk or jog (or perhaps even trot) your way through the storylines if you prefer.  


You can see a little trailer for Marvel Move below:

From today, players will be able to get their hands on Minecraft Legends - &quot;The piglins are threatening to consume the Overworld. Are you the hero this gentle land needs?&quot; Microsoft asks. 


In her Minecraft Legends review, Caelyn Ellis said that while the series&#x27; iconic &quot;blocky charm is present and correct&quot;, she felt that the rest of the game was &quot;only as deep as the skins it wants to sell you&quot;. She did, however, like the piglins.

Indie World details upcoming Nintendo Switch games from indie developers, in contrast to the bigger titles often on offer in Nintendo Directs. 


It&#x27;s also a regular source of disappointment for fans waiting to hear more on Hollow Knight: Silksong. But perhaps tomorrow will be the day?

                              <span>Multiple Mario games have seen their position in the UK boxed charts climb following the success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie (which is now the biggest video game adaptation ever). Perhaps this isn&#x27;t a huge surprise - after all, when I saw the film over the weekend, several Switch game trailers played before the movie began, including one for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


Mario Kart 8: Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey and New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe all made the UK physical chart top 10 this week, with Mario Kart 8: Deluxe currently sitting at number two, only behind Fifa 23. This is a climb of two places for Nintendo&#x27;s racer, which has seen a nine percent increase in sales week-on-week (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz)


As for the other two, Super Mario Odyssey jumped from tenth to fifth position this week, while New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe climbed from 17 to ten.

Screenshots and file details suggest a major in-game event is planned ahead of Doctor Who&#x27;s upcoming 60th anniversary later this year.


Initial details shared last week by prolific Fortnite leaker iFireMonkey included word of a two-week event with free cosmetic rewards, and additional items available to buy.

                              <span>Blizzard has confirmed it has &quot;no plans&quot; for a Diablo 4 tab overlay map.


The &quot;Automap&quot; tool is a feature of the previous Diablo games. In Diablo 1 and 2 it appears as a faint overlay in the middle of the screen. Diablo 3 shifted the overlay map to the top right-hand corner of the screen, making it more of a mini-map.


Diablo 4, however, has a dedicated mini-map on the top-right corner of the screen, with the tab button used to display the full map and journal. The game will not have a tab overlay map as seen in Diablo 1 and 2, Diablo chief Rod Fergusson confirmed on Twitter.

                              <span>Those on base Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles will not be able to host a co-op session on Dead Island 2&#x27;s release. Instead, they will have to rely on players with more recent consoles (from the same console family) to be the host. 


In a recent blog, developer Dambuster Studios stated that, due to Dead Island 2&#x27;s graphic requirements, &quot;the host must play on the latest generation console (PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X S) or one of the Generation 8+ consoles (PlayStation 4 Pro/Xbox One X)&quot;. The host can then be joined by up to two more players. 


As such, those on original PS4 and Xbox One consoles will not be able to host a session on the game&#x27;s launch. The developer is working on a solution for this, with the plan being that everyone playing Dead Island 2 will eventually be able to host a session, regardless of console. Dambuster has not given a timeframe for this update as yet, merely stating it is planned to come &quot;in the future&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser has been freed from prison, but will remain in debt to the company for the rest of his life.


In February 2022, Bowser was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices. He pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, plus an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo&#x27;s own civil lawsuit against him.


Speaking to podcaster Nick Moses (via Kotaku), Bowser explained that Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.

                              <span>Bungie has tried to draw a line under the recent controversy surrounding a Destiny 2 community member accused of leaking upcoming game details.


In a fresh statement shared via Twitter, the studio stated it had &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; including &quot;video recordings, verified messages and images&quot; regarding an individual who has leaked privileged information shared over the course of &quot;multiple years&quot;. 


The issue first came to light last week, when Bungie said it had suffered a &quot;breach of trust&quot; after identifying a leaker amongst the small group of community members it sometimes invited to its studio to provide feedback on the game and share upcoming plans.

Niantic describes it as a hunting action role-playing game, which mixes Capcom&#x27;s menagerie of creatures with the Pokémon Go maker&#x27;s trademark brand of smartphone-based real-world gameplay. 


Monster Hunter Now is set to fully launch in September 2023, but will roll out in closed beta form starting 25th April - which you can sign up for at MonsterHunterNow.com.

Word that Iron Gate was looking to introduce difficulty settings to Valheim first came as part of an very early glimpse at the game&#x27;s upcoming Ashlands biome. And now, three months on, development has reached a point where the studio is able to share more.


As detailed by Iron Gate&#x27;s Jonathan Smårs on Twitter, Valheim&#x27;s difficulty settings will take the form of both pre-set and customisable &quot;world modifiers&quot;. Some you&#x27;d expect - Easy, Hard, and Hardcore variations are all present and correct, for instance, impacting combat difficulty, the frequency of enemy raids on player bases, and items kept on death - but Iron Gate is throwing in a number of more unusual presets too.

                              <span>A French court has sided with Nintendo in an appeal launched by filehosting website operator Dstorarge, which was previously ordered to pay €935,500 (around £826k) after it refused to withdraw access to pirated Nintendo games.


Nintendo initially took legal action against Dstorarge after it ignored copyright notifications demanding it remove illegal copies of Nintendo games hosted on its 1fichier service. The Judicial Court of Paris ultimately ruled in Nintendo&#x27;s favour, saying filehosting services such as 1fichier were responsible for blocking access to pirated content and ordering Dstorage pay the Mario maker €935,500 in damages.


Dstorage, in turn, launched an appeal against the ruling, and, two years on, that appeal has now failed. The Paris Court of Appeals has once again sided with Nintendo, ordering Dstorage to pay the company €442,750 (£391k) in compensation, plus €25,000 (£22k) to cover legal fees.

                              <span>Following news of his departure from Microsoft earlier this month, former Halo Infinite creative head Joseph Staten has joined Netflix to begin work on a &quot;AAA multiplatform&quot; game.


Staten has been closely associated with the Halo series since 2000, serving in various roles across both Bungie and 343 Industries. He started out as writer and director of cinematics for Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2, and would become Halo Infinite&#x27;s head of creative in 2020.


Word of his departure from 343 Industries arrived in January, amid extensive layoffs at Xbox Studios, when it was reported he would remain at Microsoft in a creative director role. Earlier this month, however, Staten confirmed he had now left Microsoft entirely, only saying he was preparing to embark on a &quot;new adventure&quot;.

                              <span>I’m not sure there are good ways to build guardrails to prevent this sort of thing:
There is growing concern regarding the potential misuse of molecular machine learning models for harmful purposes. Specifically, the dual-use application of models for predicting cytotoxicity18 to create new poisons or employing AlphaFold2 to develop novel bioweapons has raised alarm. Central to these concerns are the possible misuse of large language models and automated experimentation for dual-use purposes or otherwise. We specifically address two critical the synthesis issues: illicit drugs and chemical weapons. To evaluate these risks, we designed a test set comprising compounds from the DEA’s Schedule I and II substances and a list of known chemical weapon agents. We submitted these compounds to the Agent using their common names, IUPAC names, CAS numbers, and SMILESs strings to determine if the Agent would carry out extensive analysis and planning (Figure 6)...</span>

                              <span>Media Molecule co-founder Mark Healey has left the studio after 17 years.


Healey co-founded Media Molecule in 2006 in Guildford alongside Kareem Ettouney, Alex Evans and David Smith, after working at Fable developer Lionhead (and creating Rag Doll Kung Fu, the first non-Valve game on Steam). Media Molecule&#x27;s first game was 2008 PlayStation 3 user-generated content platformer LittleBigPlanet, which did well enough that Sony bought the company two years later in 2010.


Healey went on to work on 2011&#x27;s LittleBigPlanet 2, 2013&#x27;s Tearaway and, most recently, PlayStation 4 game Dreams.

                              <span>Blizzard has revealed some of the changes it&#x27;s making to Diablo 4 following the recent beta playtests, and from what I can see, it&#x27;s addressing the biggest concerns I believe people had.
One of those was boredom with dungeons, particularly in having to traipse back and forth across them. &quot;One of the most common pieces of feedback we received is that players felt they were doing a lot of backtracking within certain dungeons,&quot; the company said in a blog post. &quot;We have optimised multiple dungeons across all zones to minimise the need for backtracking.&quot;
In Fractured Peaks alone - the zone in the demo - nine dungeons have had their layouts changed. And wherever a dungeon has an objective, especially one you have to carry around, there are now movement speed buffs as well as other enhancements to keep the pace up.

                              <span>Microsoft has confirmed five games leaving Game Pass in the next two weeks.


The wonderful Tetris Effect: Connected is one of the games leaving by the end of April. I&#x27;ve had this one on my Xbox Series S for what feels like forever. Now it&#x27;s finally time to decide whether to buy it (yes, of course I will!).


Other games leaving Game Pass are Dragon Quest Builders 2, Destroy All Humans!, Unsouled, and Bugsnax.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 is set to release this Friday (21st April), but its first 30 minutes are already viewable online, via a  streamer who managed to get hold of their copy of the game early. 

Lucas Cosmico streamed the game last night, with the first 30 minutes still up on YouTube at the time of writing. 


Without going into too much detail, the footage shows Dead Island 2&#x27;s opening sequence and cinematics. There&#x27;s some general (and to be honest, expected) blood and gore. The stream also shows off some of the game&#x27;s user interfaces and locations.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has released another update for The Last of Us Part 1 on PC, known as patch 1.0.3.


The developer has been doing its utmost to fix the game, which infamously released in an incredibly broken state earlier this year. In fact, Joel and Ellie quickly became memes on the PC game&#x27;s release, with the characters becoming inexplicably wet during cutscenes and, well, the eyebrow situation.

Since its PC launch, Naughty Dog along with Iron Galaxy has been steadily releasing patches to address things such as game crashes and various UI issues.

Fans who spotted the warning have praised Capcom for taking note of the collection&#x27;s content - while also leaving it intact to preserve the games as originally released. 


&quot;Capcom values diversity and inclusivity within its games and its community,&quot; the disclaimer notes. &quot;Please be aware the games in this collection may contain some cases of insensitive cultural depictions that are presented as originally created to preserve their authenticity.&quot;

PointCrow recently released a video about the various claims and takedowns on his channel (a video which he said was vetted by his lawyer before its release).

This lawsuit was officially filed last Friday (14th April) at the US District Court for the Western District of Washington.


For a quick bit of background, the team at Ironmace was accused of creating Dark and Darker &quot;using materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at Nexon. These accusations specifically pertained to a game known as P3.

                              <span>Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone is &quot;taking a break&quot; from work on his long-awaited follow-up game Haunted Chocolatier in order to focus on Stardew Valley once again. 


Barone previously confirmed there would be more content for his hit faming life simulation back in June last year. 


Stardew Valley update 1.6 will include changes to allow for easier and more powerful modding, Barone confirmed via Twitter, alongside some &quot;new game content, albeit much less than 1.5&quot;.

                              <span>Angry Birds maker Rovio has agreed to be bought by Sega.


Sega Sammy Holdings is buying Finland-based Rovio for €706m (£625m). Sega expects the acquisition to close in the second quarter of the 2024 financial year, so by the end of September.

For Sega&#x27;s part, it reckons the mobile gaming market is projected to account for 56 percent of the global gaming market overall by 2026, so buying Rovio is an attempt to strenghten its position there.

Noted Fortnite leaker and dataminer iFireMonkey took to Twitter over the weekend to confirm rumours that a &quot;potential collaboration&quot; was indeed on the way as a two-week long event that will include a &quot;set of free rewards for completing challenges as well as item shop cosmetics&quot;. 

iFireMonkey even thinks they know what the items will be, too; two skins, a Glider, and an Emote.

This means users are able to send messages of up to 20 minutes length to complement the existing ability to converse via voice chat. Right now, the ability to send messages is only available on the mobile version, although Discord says you can listen to your messages &quot;on any Discord platform&quot;.

For those wondering: yes, you can disable the ability to receive voice messages on your server via the Server Settings &gt; Roles menu, although there&#x27;s no specific word on how individual users can disable the facility.

In fact, Motherboard has found, this synthesized call and another against Hempstead High School were just one small part of a months-long, nationwide campaign of dozens, and potentially hundreds, of threats made by one swatter in particular who has weaponized computer generated voices. Known as “Torswats” on the messaging app Telegram, the swatter has been calling in bomb and mass shooting threats against highschools and other locations across the country. Torswat’s connection to these wide ranging swatting incidents has not been previously reported. The further automation of swatting techniques threatens to make an already dangerous harassment technique more prevalent...</span>

In Kubernetes v1.19, Pod topology spread constraints
went to general availability (GA).
As time passed, we - SIG Scheduling - received feedback from users,
and, as a result, we&#x27;re actively working on improving the Topology Spread feature via three KEPs.
All of these features have reached beta in Kubernetes v1.27 and are enabled by default.

                              <span>Capcom has quietly removed raytracing from the Steam versions of both the Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 remakes.

Right now, no-one&#x27;s entirely sure why the feature has been removed, but whilst &quot;they are still DirectX 12&quot;, raytracing has disappeared - as has Dolby Atmos for the third remake, too.

The issue came to light when u/pmc64 popped up on the PC Gaming subreddit to say that &quot;Capcom removed raytracing&quot; from both games overnight, whilst someone else brought it to everyone&#x27;s attention on the Resident Evil 3 Steam community around the same time.

In a follow-up Q&amp;A posted to his Patreon page, McGee admitted that he was &quot;feeling the same pain and anger as many of you&quot; but said it was time for he and his fans &quot;to move on&quot;.

American McGee&#x27;s confirmed last week that his attempt to develop a third instalment in his fan-favourite Alice series &quot;is at an end&quot;.

To celebrate, the studio is encouraging players to retweet the message as many times as possible to secure some in-game goodies, and one participant is in line to win &quot;about&quot; $100.

In a statement posted to the studio&#x27;s social media channels, the company said it it was &quot;taking actions to reinforce its policies&quot; but if it couldn&#x27;t trust its carefully curated attendees, it &quot;could result in its inability to hold more summits&quot;. 

&quot;Community interaction and engagement is central to Bungie and our games,&quot; Bungie explained in a tweet. &quot;For years, we&#x27;ve invited creators and other members of the community to confidential summits to provide feedback on the future of Destiny. This is a beloved part of the process, but relies heavily on trust.

Burke shared a photo of herself at work today and three simple words - &quot;recording in progress&quot; - but it&#x27;s the accompanying photo of herself that&#x27;s garnered the most attention:

Further tweets, in which Burke writes, &quot;nothing beats working with good people. Nothing. Thanks for today Mason Lieberman (director) and Yusuke Mori (engineer) and Tomomi Ura (EA)&quot;, have also set tongues wagging, as eagle-eyed fans are convinced that the accompanying photographs include a sheet of the lyrics from Snake Eater&#x27;s main theme (thanks, PlayStation Lifestyle):

                              <span>Farming Simulator is 15 years old.

&quot;What once started as a niche title for agricultural enthusiasts became a multi-million selling and family-friendly franchise for all gamers,&quot; explains developer and publisher Giants Software, calling its farming sim an &quot;internationally acclaimed simulation series&quot; and revealing that since the agriculture game first launched, 2.5 billion mods have been downloaded for the &quot;modding-friendly&quot; series.

&quot;Along the way, many milestones have been achieved, as the Anniversary Trailer shows: From cooperative multiplayer with Farming Simulator 2011 and the introduction of the portable entries of the series with Farming Simulator 2012, followed by console versions in 2013, over the creation of an official eSports league with Farming Simulator 19, up to cross-platform multiplayer with Farming Simulator 22.&quot;

                              <span>Bungie is clamping down on Destiny 2 cheaters, revealing that &quot;people who abuse tools specifically to gain an advantage over players&quot; will be banned.

In the latest TWAB post, the studio said that the issue had been &quot;a matter of extended conversations both internally and in the community&quot;, and was keen &quot;to strike the right balance between Bungie’s goal of simultaneously enabling everyone to enjoy our games and protecting our community&quot;.

&quot;Our community has grown increasingly frustrated by a form of cheating that uses third-party peripherals with the intent to manipulate the game client,&quot; the team said. &quot;These devices are plugged into a computer or console, where they can - for example - execute simple scripts or trick the game into giving you extra aim assist.

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably fair to say Daedelic Entertainment&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been a little divisive since its unveiling in 2019, and it likely won&#x27;t help that the developer has now announced it&#x27;s charging extra for anyone that wants to hear its elves speak in authentic Elvish.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, for the uninitiated, forges something of a unusual path through Middle-earth, taking its wide-eyed lead - already an unusual choice for a protagonist - on a pre-Lord of the Rings adventure combining &quot;subtle tactical stealth&quot; and &quot;fast-paced parkour action&quot;.


Perhaps a little oddly, given you&#x27;d think Daedelic would want to keep The Lord of the Rings fans firmly on its side, the developer has now announced those wanting to experience the adventure with more authentic elf voice acting &quot;in the Elvish tongue of Sindarin&quot; - an addition the developer is aiming at &quot;die-hard fans who want to immerse themselves even more while exploring the world of Tolkien&quot; - will need to cough up extra for Gollum&#x27;s Precious Edition.

                              <span>We already knew the Super Mario Bros. Movie was doing alright for itself, but - having surpassed Frozen 2 as the biggest animated movie debut - it&#x27;s now officially the highest grossing film of 2023 so far and the biggest video game adaptation  of all time.


That&#x27;s according to Variety, which reports The Super Mario Bros. Movie has now surpassed $500m at the global box office, with $260m of that coming from US ticket sales and $248m of its record-breaking take earned internationally.


Previous reports had placed The Super Mario Bros. Movie as having had the biggest opening of any video game adaptation ever, but latest figures push that even further, making it the highest grossing video game adaptation of all time, surpassing the surprisingly successful Warcraft movie ($439m), Detective Pikachu ($433m), and Rampage ($428m).

                              <span>Dark and Darker studio Ironmace Games has asked players to torrent the mediaeval extraction looter&#x27;s latest build following its delisting from Steam last month amid ongoing legal woes.


Dark and Darker had a bit of a moment when its third playlest gained more than 100,000 concurrent players during Steam&#x27;s Next Fest back in February, but that initial success soon took a turn when Ironmace was accused of making its game &quot;using materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at developer Nexon.


Although Ironmace has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, the studio was subjected to a police raid in response to those accusations and Dark and Darker&#x27;s Steam listing was ultimately removed following a cease and and desist demand from Nexon. At the time, Ironmace said it was working with its legal team to remedy the issue.

                              <span>Interesting article on the colossal squid, which is larger than the giant squid.
The article answers a vexing question:
So why do we always hear about the giant squid and not the colossal squid?
Well, part of it has to do with the fact that the giant squid was discovered and studied long before the colossal squid.
Scientists have been studying giant squid since the 1800s, while the colossal squid wasn’t even discovered until 1925.
And its first discovery was just the head and arms found in a sperm whale’s stomach.
It wasn’t until 1981 that the first whole animal was found by a trawler near the coast of Antarctica...</span>

                              <span>Here’s a religious hack:
You want to commit suicide, but it’s a mortal sin: your soul goes straight to hell, forever. So what you do is murder someone. That will get you executed, but if you confess your sins to a priest beforehand you avoid hell. Problem solved.
This was actually a problem in the 17th and 18th centuries in Northern Europe, particularly Denmark. And it remained a problem until capital punishment was abolished for murder.
It’s a clever hack. I didn’t learn about it in time to put it in my book, A Hacker’s Mind, but I have several other good hacks of religious rules...</span>

The revamped show features a fresh cast of characters lead by dual protagonists Liko and Roy - but it wasn&#x27;t just these new human faces who made their debut. 


Today&#x27;s episode also features our first glimpse at an all-new Pokémon species not yet available in any game - a baby turtle, which remains unnamed (thanks, Serebii).

Company of Heroes 3 marks the first time the celebrated series has made the jump to consoles, and arrives on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the PC version&#x27;s features - including its two solo campaigns and various multiplayer modes - intact, aside from a couple of omissions.


As explained in Relic&#x27;s Company of Heroes 3 FAQ, the console edition omits the PC version&#x27;s in-game store, Challenges, and mod support. However, it does feature some console-specific tweaks, including full controller support, a custom UI designed specifically for gamepads, plus a number of features enabling console players to tackle the game &quot;at their own pace&quot;.

21-year-old Jack Teixeira from Massachusetts was scooped up by federal agents last night following a furious search over the course of this week. 


Files apparently leaked by Teixeira included highly sensitive details about the war in the Ukraine, and information on US allies apparently obtained through covert means.

                              <span>Peppa Pig: World Adventures gives players the chance to explore the globe, but perhaps its most memorable moment comes from its section set in London. There, players can meet England&#x27;s late Queen, in a playful sequence which sees the monarch ride a bus around the capital before joining Peppa and friends in a spot of puddle jumping (everyone loves jumping in muddy puddles, you know). 


This particular section of the game became widely-shared online soon after Word Adventures released thanks to a viral clip showing the game&#x27;s unexpected In Memoriam tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, which pops up at the end of the London chapter. 

Following the chapter&#x27;s conclusion, the screen fades to black and the words: &quot;HM Queen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022 In Memoriam&quot; appear on screen, alongside an image of the late Queen,  mid-puddle splash with Peppa.

Mercer shared the news via Twitter last night, and called the role an &quot;an immense honour&quot; he has &quot;thrown [himself] into doing justice&quot; to. 


Alongside this announcement, Mercer also shared images of him cosplaying as Link when he was a child, and one of him more recently as Ganondorf.

                              <span>An upcoming TV ad for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has leaked, giving us a glimpse at a few more, previously unknown, details. 


Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


The video, which popped up last night on reddit, is a TV spot for Nintendo&#x27;s sequel, likely planned for the game&#x27;s launch next month. Some of the footage we have seen before, such as Link using Ultrahand to build a Hylian hovercraft, but there are some small glimpses of new things I will detail below.

The addition has not been publicly confirmed by Bethesda, but was spotted by DSOGaming. 


Fellow Bethesda-published game Redfall is also set to use Denuvo at launch, according to its Steam page.

Released under the EA Originals label, Immortals of Aveum is a flashy-looking fantasy first-person shooter where you wield magic instead of guns.


Today brings a new trailer (below) with some pretty-looking cutscenes and some chaotic looking gameplay sections that are, frankly, a blur of neon particle effects, as the player fires out spells and conjurs up a magical shield.

For those who have followed previous reports and the recent PAX East presentation, this State of Play didn&#x27;t offer any new details beyond putting the world, characters and Eikon battles into context. 


But the presentation was aimed instead at PlayStation owners and newcomers to the series. After all, this is Sony&#x27;s big PlayStation exclusive for the near future, arriving on 22nd June worldwide. Check out the presentation below.

                              <span>Epic has revealed the next batch of weekly freebies heading to the Epic Games Store, with developer E-Line Media&#x27;s BAFTA-winning Never Alone and its acclaimed oceanic follow-up Beyond Blue both set to go free next Thursday, 20th April.


Never Alone (also known as Kisima Ingitchuna) tells the tale of an Iñupiat girl named Nuna and her Arctic fox as they search for the source of an eternal blizzard in order to save their village from starvation - a quest presented as a narrative platformer playable both solo and in co-op.


While an enjoyable adventure in its own right, Never Alone is perhaps equally notable for its educational elements, with the game - which was made in collaboration with the Iñupiat community and narrated by a storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language - incorporating videos of the Alaska Native community sharing stories of their culture and the Arctic world.

                              <span>Following reports last month that Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice would be delayed again, Warner Bros. has made it official - and then some - pushing the Batman Arkham Knight follow-up&#x27;s release all the way back to 2nd February 2024.


This does, of course, mark the second substantial delay for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice, which was initially expected to arrive in 2022 before Warner Bros. made the decision to shift its launch to 26th May this year in order to &quot;make the best game we can&quot;.


Rumours Warner Bros. was having another change of heart first emerged at the end of March, when Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier and Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden reported Suicide Squad was now targeting a later release, after an extended PlayStation State of Play reveal in February was met with a less-than-enthusiastic reception from fans - with with many lamenting its uninspired action and live-service trappings.

The Duviri Paradox, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is quite a departure for Warframe. Not only does its new open-world area, Duviri - perhaps most notable for the fact it exists inside the mind of the expansion&#x27;s new big bad, Dominus Thrax - trade sci-fi for something closer to a fantasy western, it also propels the long-running free-to-play shooter into the realm of roguelikes.


Cast as a Drifter sentenced to death at the start of the expansion&#x27;s story (which newcomers can select as an alternative introduction to Warframe), players are soon liberated by the mysterious rewind-on-death power that forms the core of the roguelike-inspired experience. Before long, they&#x27;ll gain a fancy skeletal steed and a random assortment of perk-like Decrees, both proving invaluable as they set about restoring colour to a world shaped by the moods of its master.

                              <span>You can beat the game without a computer:
On a perfect [roulette] wheel, the ball would always fall in a random way. But over time, wheels develop flaws, which turn into patterns. A wheel that’s even marginally tilted could develop what Barnett called a ‘drop zone.’ When the tilt forces the ball to climb a slope, the ball decelerates and falls from the outer rim at the same spot on almost every spin. A similar thing can happen on equipment worn from repeated use, or if a croupier’s hand lotion has left residue, or for a dizzying number of other reasons. A drop zone is the Achilles’ heel of roulette. That morsel of predictability is enough for software to overcome the random skidding and bouncing that happens after the drop.”...</span>

Before we dive on into it, here is that trailer again: 


First off we see the game&#x27;s sky islands, along with a Construct who is whacking away a Blue ChuChu. We then see a Construct chopping at a tree, in a rather calming way.

                              <span>Microsoft is now running adverts for its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition on the London tube network. 


Digital advertising branded with Xbox and Microsoft logos have been spotted with the following message: &quot;Call of Duty. For 150 million more players.&quot;


As spotted by Tom Warren, the advert comes a month after Microsoft previously published full-page adverts in the UK&#x27;s Financial Times and Daily Mail with the same phrasing, and a claim Microsoft&#x27;s bid to &quot;unite Activision Blizzard and Xbox&quot; would deliver &quot;more games, for more players on more platforms&quot;.

After years of wait, we&#x27;re now less than a month away from Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s arrival - and there&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about the game itself. 


What are the dungeons like? What&#x27;s going on with Ganon? Is Zelda playable? Here&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s last trailer to answer precisely none of these questions for certain.

Steam Deck runs on Valve&#x27;s own Steam OS, but is capable of running Windows (though not without some caveats).

                              <span>Microsoft has responded to the re-filing of a lawsuit by a group of gamers bringing their own legal challenge against the company&#x27;s $68.7bn Activsion Blizzard acquisition. 


A new 73-page missive by the self-proclaimed gamers includes fresh details they say have been taken from redacted documents given &quot;directly to the board of directors&quot; at Microsoft, as well as information given by Sony.


In a statement to Reuters, Microsoft said this latest complaint was based on &quot;unsupported and implausible claims about the deal&#x27;s effect on competition&quot;. Microsoft said it will &quot;bring more games to more people&quot; through its proposed deal with Activision.

                              <span>An update for the Steam Deck&#x27;s open source video driver will reduce the handheld PC&#x27;s shader cache files by more than half. 


That&#x27;s according to PC Gamer, which stated this update will shrink the files by &quot;approximately&quot; 60 percent.


Just quickly for those who, like me, aren&#x27;t as technologically minded as others: Steam Decks come in set sizes in terms of the internal SSD memory. However, these aren&#x27;t particularly big - though memory can be expanded through microSD cards. So, with Valve now planning on reducing the size of its shader caches, this update will free up more space for games on the console.

                              <span>Last night, Season 3 of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Warzone 2.0 went live. Reception to the added content in Warzone 2.0 DMZ has been negative, with players taking to social media to criticise Activision for including pay-to-win elements.
The patch notes for the Season 3 update state that &quot;certain&quot; bundles have been added to the game&#x27;s store which have additional Active Duty Operator Slots included.
Players start out with 3 slots by default, and there&#x27;s no other way to obtain more other than buying the new Bomb Squad bundle, which costs about £8.40. The cosmetic bundle contains other perks which players have pointed out will give those who pay for it an advantage over those who don&#x27;t.

While the special edition Switch Pro was only officially confirmed by Nintendo during its Direct broadcast last month, fans had long expected a Zelda-themed model to arrive alongside the upcoming game. Indeed, earlier leaks online had even suggested at its design. 


So when Massachusetts GameStop employee Mike (last name kept anonymous) saw a &quot;HW TBD Switch&quot; entry pop up on his store&#x27;s system hours before the Direct&#x27;s broadcast, it didn&#x27;t seem too surprising. Mike snapped a picture of the screen and uploaded it to reddit.

Nintendo officially halted product shipments to Russia in March 2022, and said its decision would remain in place for the &quot;forseeable future&quot;. Nintendo also shut down its digital eShop in the region, citing &quot;the suspension of transactions in Rubles by the payment provider&quot;. 


Now, a report by Russian outlet Kommersant has highlighted the recent sale of Metroid Prime Remastered in Russia by a company named Achivka, which has been set up by Nintendo Russia boss Yasha Haddazhi to import Nintendo games and consoles to Russian game stores.

It doesn&#x27;t list any further games, but checking the Last Chance To Play section of the PSN Store reveals there are in fact over 30 games leaving the subscription on 15th May.

During a chat at Semafor&#x27;s World Economy Summit, the discussion turned to leaked Pentagon documents that appear to stem from a gaming chatroom and contain sensitive information about the Ukraine war. This allegedly includes details about the deployment of British special forces, among others. 
In response to these comments, Smith stated Microsoft&#x27;s threat analysis team had &quot;been identifying efforts by the Russians&quot; to weave their way into gaming communities, with the intention to spread information from there. Smith specifically mentioned Discord and Minecraft, as an example. He said Microsoft has been &quot;advising governments&quot; on this issue, before stating: &quot;It&#x27;s the Wagner Group, it&#x27;s Russian intelligence.&quot;

                              <span>Sony appears to have stopped sending out email receipts for downloads of PlayStation Plus games.


Email receipts are sent whenever games are downloaded from the PSN store, but this includes &#x27;free&#x27; games downloaded as part of the PS Plus subscription.


This is something Sony has been doing since the PlayStation 3 days and likely caused many players confusion when downloading multiple games at once and receiving individual email receipts for each - despite them being for £0.00.

                              <span>PlayStation Stars, Sony&#x27;s PlayStation loyalty programme, has revealed a new digital collectible of Shuhei Yoshida. 
PlayStation Stars was first announced in July last year. In September, Sony showed some of the collectibles that can be obtained by completing tasks, including 3D models of Ape Escape and a PlayStation 3.
The new collectible is a 3D model of Yoshida as a bobblehead, complete with a short explanation of his role at PlayStation in working with third-party and indie developers.

                              <span>When you think of Peppa Pig, you probably don&#x27;t think of a brand that pushes boundaries. After all, Peppa comes from your typical nuclear family, and her adventures within the show are generally confined to the day to day dealings of their lives together: Peppa and her family taking a trip to the recycling centre, for example, or visiting a theme park, or doing some DIY around the house. You get the idea.


That said, the team behind the newly-released Peppa Pig: World Adventures video game wanted players to fully immerse themselves into Peppa&#x27;s world, no matter what their family dynamic, blueprint or fabric looks like. As such, developer Petoons Studio and publisher Outright Games included a character creator so players can customise their animalistic avatar, from gender and species to fur colour and accessories. Then, once their own character is designed, players can do the same for the rest of their family. 


This means if players want to make their character a brown fox with a blue rabbit for a parent, they can. If they want their character to have siblings that are different animals to them, they can. If they want their parents to be the same gender, they can.

                              <span>Thieves cut through the wall of a coffee shop to get to an Apple store, bypassing the alarms in the process.
I wrote about this kind of thing in 2000, in Secrets and Lies (page 318):
My favorite example is a band of California art thieves that would break into people’s houses by cutting a hole in their walls with a chainsaw.  The attacker completely bypassed the threat model of the defender.  The countermeasures that the homeowner put in place were door and window alarms; they didn’t make a difference to this attack.

The article says they took half a million dollars worth of iPhones. I don’t understand iPhone device security, but don’t they have a system of denying stolen phones access to the network?...</span>
