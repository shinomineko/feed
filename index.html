&quot;When will Kubernetes have IPv6?&quot; This question has been asked with increasing frequency ever since alpha support for IPv6 was first added in k8s v1.9. While Kubernetes has supported IPv6-only clusters since v1.18, migration from IPv4 to IPv6 was not yet possible at that point. At long last, dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 networking has reached general availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.23.
What does dual-stack networking mean for you? Let’s take a look…
Service API updates
Services were single-stack before 1.20, so using both IP families meant creating one Service per IP family. The user experience was simplified in 1.20, when Services were re-implemented to allow both IP families, meaning a single Service can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 workloads. Dual-stack load…</span>

                    <span>Ubisoft is releasing a new update for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla next week and, ahead of its arrival, the publisher has warned it&#x27;ll require players to download the entire game - ranging from around 40GB to 78GB, depending on platform - again.
Ubisoft shared the warning in a post to its forum, explaining a full download would be required with update 1.4.1 as part of base game restructuring needed in order for the development team to support Valhalla&#x27;s &quot;future content and game updates&quot;.

                    <span>Sonic the Hedgehog is celebrating his 30th birthday this year, and the anniversary festivities are set to continue later this week, with a look at Sonic&#x27;s upcoming movie sequel and next game both now confirmed for the Game Awards. Oh, and a new movie poster has been revealed too.
Sega first unveiled its new Sonic game during the hedgehog&#x27;s special 30th birthday livestream back in May. The accompanying teaser trailer didn&#x27;t offer much beyond a quick snatch of the iconic gaming mascot speeding through a forest, but a later press release named the game - planned to launch on Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2022 - as Sonic Rangers. However, Sega later retracted that name, claiming its inclusion was a mistake.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s single-player campaign was once planned as a vast Zelda-like experience - but this was drastically cut back, as part of 343 Industries&#x27; plan to reduce the game&#x27;s size by almost two-thirds for its final version.
A new Bloomberg report details the rough journey developer 343 Industries took, leading up to the release of Halo Infinite this week.

Major Themes
Deprecation of FlexVolume
FlexVolume is deprecated. The out-of-tree CSI driver is the recommended way to write volume drivers in Kubernetes. See this doc for more information. Maintainers of FlexVolume drivers should implement a CSI driver and move users of FlexVolume to CSI. Users of FlexVolume should move their workloads to the CSI driver.
Deprecation of klog specific flags
To simplify the code base, several logging flags were marked as deprecated in Kubernetes …</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but Halo&#x27;s live-action TV adaptation will soon get a proper reveal, courtesy of its first full-length trailer airing at this week&#x27;s Game Awards. Before all that though, there&#x27;s the briefest of new teases to stoke a spot of anticipation and get you in the mood.
The live-action Halo series - which was first announced all the way back in 2013, at the height of Microsoft&#x27;s infatuation with TV, TV, TV - got its first teaser trailer during November&#x27;s Xbox Anniversary Celebration. It admittedly didn&#x27;t show very much - Master Chief popped on his helmet, Cortana said hello - but it was just enough to get fans in the mood.

Ubisoft says the Anno team is &quot;just getting started&quot; on its latest DLC journey and so isn&#x27;t quite ready to reveal specifics just yet. However, its blog post offers a few teases on the direction Seasons 4&#x27;s three planned DLCs will be taking, with the focus this time around said being the New World - in contrast to the Old World focus of Season 3.

                    <span>In case you weren&#x27;t aware just yet, Gran Turismo 7 is all about delivering more of a classical Gran Turismo experience, after the more experimental multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport. Which probably explains why our best look at the game in action to date comes via the reveal of classic circuit Deep Forest, which PlayStation just served up a full in-game onboard playthrough. 
The fictional Deep Forest circuit made its debut alongside the Gran Turismo series way back in 1997, and has been a fan favourite ever since. Its appearance in Gran Turismo 7 is, perhaps unsurprisingly, its most impressive yet, and the lap onboard a GT Lamborghini shows a track that&#x27;s at once visually outstanding while also being remarkably faithful to the PS1 original.

                    <span>From Ontario and not surprising:
Since September 2021, officers have investigated five incidents where suspects have placed small tracking devices on high-end vehicles so they can later locate and steal them. Brand name “air tags” are placed in out-of-sight areas of the target vehicles when they are parked in public places like malls or parking lots. Thieves then track the targeted vehicles to the victim’s residence, where they are stolen from the driveway.
Thieves typically use tools like screwdrivers to enter the vehicles through the driver or passenger door, while ensuring not to set off alarms. Once inside, an electronic device, typically used by mechanics to reprogram the factory setting, is connected to the onboard diagnostics port below the dashboard and programs the vehicle to accept a key the thieves have brought with them. Once the new key is programmed, the vehicle will start and the thieves drive it away...</span>

                    <span>Epic Games has revealed what&#x27;s next for Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 with its all-new &quot;Flipped&quot; trailer, highlighting the island&#x27;s startling new look.
&quot;Due to a particularly cold winter, the first thing you&#x27;ll notice about the Island is that the western half&#x27;s a wintry biome,&quot; the studio teases in the video description. &quot;Perhaps stop by the suburban Greasy Grove, the industrial Logjam Lumberyard, and other locales.

Without pointing to specific posts of concern, Redditor and moderator 343-Guilty-Spark posted a message over the weekend, instructing Halo fans to &quot;take the weekend off&quot; as the subreddit would be closed to comments until tomorrow, Monday 6th December.

In a blog posted earlier today, Yoshida said congested server queues have persisted since the start of Endwalker&#x27;s Early Access period, acknowledging it has been &quot;the cause of many inconveniences to our players&quot;.

Though the secret modes can only be seen by players accessing the playlist offline - which sounds counter-intuitive, given Halo Infinite is an online multiplayer shooter - players can save and share the playlists, which then makes them playable online.

Although the publisher confirmed it is &quot;still hard at work on building the next singleplayer focused experience for Dragon Age&quot; and that we have to wait until &quot;next year when [EA/BioWare] can talk more about what [they&#x27;re] working on&quot;, the new short stories - written by members of the BioWare team - should help tide us over.

It gives us a peek at an iconic Resident Evil enemy - the Cerberus hound - which looks super cute and healthy at first, until it turns its head and shows the rotting flesh on the other side of its skull before it flashes to the logo.

Washington Post reports that the studio - which co-created Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War with Treyarch - is calling in its quality assurance contractors for meetings between 3rd and 8th December. It&#x27;s here staff will be told if they&#x27;ve been promoted or if they&#x27;ve been made redundant.

The bundle - which was only available to those who could get to the Team LA store at Staples Center, Los Angeles, on Friday afternoon ahead of that evening&#x27;s match against the LA Clippers - was selling for a very reasonable $140 (£105) given the price of a controller alone can set you back £55.

                    <span>Fortnite has pulled off its latest live event - typically spectacular in scope, technically ambitious in scale, and hugely important to the game&#x27;s ongoing story. Tonight&#x27;s The End event closed the book on its Chapter 2 map forever - and gave players a glimpse at what&#x27;s next.
The End event began at the small fort built over the past week by Pleasant Park and, as players arrived, they were greeted by the welcome sight of the friendly Blue Cube teleporting into the location too. It was here players would make their last stand against the Cube Queen, head of the alien race which has now plagued Fortnite&#x27;s reality for several seasons. Maybe, with the Blue Cube on side, she could be defeated?

                    <span>To date, the BioShock series has taken players deep beneath the ocean circa the 1960s, high into the clouds in 1912, not to mention a multitude of lighthouses spanning, possibly, all of space and time and everything between. And now, a new report has seemingly revealed where the next entry in the acclaimed FPS saga will be leading us next.
As spotted by VGC, journalist Colin Moriarty relayed fresh details on 2K Games&#x27; next BioShock project, previously confirmed to be in development at new studio Cloud Chamber, as part of his latest Sacred Symbols video.

                    <span>Sony is reportedly working on a new PlayStation subscription service to rival Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass, which will bundle together the existing PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus as part of a multi-tier membership approach.
The news comes via Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who reports the project - code-named Spartacus and expected to launch in spring 2022 - will provide subscribers with access to a range of both modern and classic for a monthly fee.

                    <span>Usually, the first step after purchasing an expensive bit of portable consumer electronics (apart from turning it on and going &quot;woo&quot;, of course) is to find some sort of case to put it in. Ordinarily this is the point where I just cram my new purchase into a sock with a resigned sigh and have done with it, but Valve has you covered as far as Steam Deck goes, and has offered a look at the cute little carry case all units of its handheld gaming PC will ship with. And also its box.
We&#x27;ve already seen a fair amount of Steam Deck in the run up to its release - including a peek at its innards and the categorisation system Valve is employing so purchasers know exactly what is and isn&#x27;t compatible with their new device on Steam - but the company&#x27;s latest update is all about what&#x27;s on the outside.

With Valhalla&#x27;s one-year anniversary now passed, Ubisoft is still to say exactly what the next year will bring. In the meantime, the game&#x27;s current Oskoreia Festival event has been extended a week until 9th December.

                    <span>Developer Colossal Order&#x27;s acclaimed city builder Cities: Skylines is being reimagined for virtual reality devices, and will be coming to Oculus Quest 2 (or Meta Quest 2 as it&#x27;ll soon be renamed) as Cities: VR in &quot;spring&quot; next year.
Cities: VR is the work of developer Fast Travel Games and aims to deliver the breadth and depth of Colossal Order&#x27;s celebrated city management title, giving players control of urban planning, traffic flow, utilities, emergency services, entertainment, the economy, and more.

                    <span>Sci-fi movie trilogy The Matrix - in which Keanu Reaves wears a trench coat and gets cross with some machines - is, after nearly a two decade absence from cinemas, making a comeback later this month in Lana Wachowski&#x27;s The Matrix Resurrections, and it looks like there&#x27;ll be some kind of accompanying tie-in &quot;experience&quot; heading to PlayStation 5.
As detailed by Reddit user the_andshrew on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, the new Matrix...thing was discovered listed in the PSN backend, where it was accompanied by an extremely minimal amount of useful information - primarily a couple of database entry numbers, an associated image, and word that it&#x27;ll be coming to PS5.

                    <span>Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Edition - the spruced up version of the spruced up version of everybody&#x27;s favourite comedic rumination on video game agency - has, not entirely unexpectedly given where we are in the year, been delayed yet again. However, there&#x27;s finally light at the end of the long, long tunnel in that it&#x27;s now expected to arrive &quot;early&quot; in 2022.
Stanley Parable&#x27;s Ultra Deluxe Edition was first announced back in 2018, with an anticipated launch of 2019. That, obviously, never came to pass, nor did it do so the following year or, as developers Galactic Cafe and Crows Crows Crows have now revealed, will it do so the year after that. &quot;Hopefully when we all reconvene this time next year for our latest Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Edition update,&quot; I wrote after the game&#x27;s 2020 delay, &quot;it&#x27;ll be to discuss how awesome this fully released thing is, and not to bow our heads as it&#x27;s jettisoned into the following year.&quot; So, uh, sorry for jinxing it, I guess.

Zampella revealed EA&#x27;s plans to create a multiple-game &quot;connected Battlefield universe&quot; in an interview with GameSpot, explaining it would feature an interconnected world with shared characters and stories, and &quot;the player at the center&quot;. The aim of the move, Zampella claimed, is to &quot;grow Battlefield and meet players where they play through various experiences and business models&quot;, including the upcoming Battlefield Mobile.

                    <span>A hacker stole $31 million from the blockchain company MonoX Finance , by exploiting a bug in software the service uses to draft smart contracts.
Specifically, the hack used the same token as both the tokenIn and tokenOut, which are methods for exchanging the value of one token for another. MonoX updates prices after each swap by calculating new prices for both tokens. When the swap is completed, the price of tokenIn­that is, the token sent by the user­decreases and the price of tokenOut­or the token received by the user­increases.
By using the same token for both tokenIn and tokenOut, the hacker greatly inflated the price of the MONO token because the updating of the tokenOut overwrote the price update of the tokenIn. The hacker then exchanged the token for $31 million worth of tokens on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains...</span>

The Kubernetes release train rolls on, and we look ahead to the release of 1.23 next week. As is our tradition, I&#x27;m pleased to bring you a look back at the process that brought us the previous version.
The release team for 1.22 was led by Savitha Raghunathan, who was, at the time, a Senior Platform Engineer at MathWorks. I spoke to Savitha on the Kubernetes Podcast from Google, the weekly* show covering the Kubernetes and Cloud Native ecosystem.
Our release conversations shine a light on the team that puts together each Kubernetes release. Make sure you subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts so you catch the story of 1.23.
And in case you&#x27;re interested in why the show has been on a hiatus the last few weeks, all will be revealed in the next episode!

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been playing Jurassic World Evolution 2 and are of the opinion it very much needs more dinosaurs, you&#x27;re in luck. Frontier has announced the park management sim&#x27;s first paid DLC expansion, which introduces four new Early Cretaceous era creatures.
Arriving exactly one month after Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s release, the Early Cretaceous Pack (as the DLC is unfussily known) costs £5.99/€7.99/$7.99 USD and adds two new new land dinosaurs, one new flying reptile, and one new marine reptile - the Wuerhosaurus, Minmi, Dsungaripterus and Kronosaurus respectively.

                    <span>Politicians in the US have announced a new legislative bill - named the Stopping Grinch Bots Act, after the Dr. Seuss character that stole Christmas - which seeks to curtail the scalping of high demand toys and goods.
The bill, which specifically targets scalpers using bots to snap up online inventories of in-demand items in order to resell them at significantly higher prices, doesn&#x27;t limit its focus to the video games industry, but it would certainly cover items such as consoles and graphics cards - both of which have been hit particularly hard by scalping as a result of supply chain issues worsened during the pandemic.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment has announced it&#x27;ll be delisting the original Titanfall from all digital stores starting today, 1st December, although servers will remain online for existing players.
In a statement announcing the news on Twitter, Respawn called Titanfall, which launched for Xbox and PC in 2014, a part of its DNA - a game that &quot;showcased the ambitions of the studio&quot; and one that &quot;continues to be a beacon of innovation that we strive for in all of our games&quot;. Despite its professed fondness for the title, however, it will be delisted on all digital storefronts starting today and will be removed from all subscription services from 1st March next year.

As part of its third quarter 2021 report, CD Projekt said it&#x27;s currently &quot;hard at work&quot; on Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions - which were originally due to launch this year before the studio made the decision to push their release into early next year - and that these would be accompanied by a &quot;major update&quot; for all platforms.

                    <span>With the season of spooky fruit mutilation behind us, Sea of Thieves is readying to trade one lot of festivities for another, and will be getting into the spirit of celebration when its jam-packed fifth season sets sail this Thursday, 2nd December.

                    <span>Babylon&#x27;s Fall contains gear and emote assets &quot;borrowed&quot; from Final Fantasy 14, developer PlatinumGames has confirmed.

                    <span>Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s standing on Steam has recently improved - it now has a &quot;Very Positive&quot; user rating and is one of the top-selling games on the platform.
Cyberpunk 2077 suffered a disastrous launch and caused developer CD Projekt severe reputational damage it has yet to recover from. It went so badly, CD Projekt changed how it operates to develop multiple AAA games and expansions in parallel, and only begin promoting its creations much closer to release.

                    <span>Authors: Tim Xu (Tencent Cloud)
Kubernetes v1.22, released in August 2021, introduced a new alpha feature that improves how Linux nodes implement memory resource requests and limits.
In prior releases, Kubernetes did not support memory quality guarantees.
For example, if you set container resources as follows:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: &quot;64Mi&quot;
        cpu: &quot;250m&quot;
      limits:
        memory: &quot;64Mi&quot;
        cpu: &quot;500m&quot;

spec.containers[].resources.requests(e.g. cpu, memory) is designed for scheduling. When you create a Pod, the Kubernetes scheduler selects a node for the Pod to run on. Each node has a maximum capacity for each of the resource types: the amount of CPU and memory it can…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s not really a new Gran Turismo without a shiny new wheel to accompany it, and for the release of Gran Turismo 7 next year Fanatec is doing the honours and pulling out all the stops as it introduces the first direct drive wheel for PlayStation with the GT DD Pro. 

It&#x27;s a piece of hardware that comes with a considerable cost, with the basic bundle that includes the direct drive hub, the bespoke GT rim and a two pedal setup coming in at 699.95EUR, running up to the premium bundle which includes a three-pedal setup and the Boost Kit 180 which increases the peak torque to 8nm. Which basically means more force feedback.

Since its arrival on Switch back in March, Capcom has released a steady flow of post-launch content for Monster Hunter Rise, ranging from the big stuff - which is to say new creatures and a proper conclusion to the Kamura Village story arc - to fun smaller additions, including a series of &#x27;collaborations&#x27; based on various video game properties.

                    <span>Just under a week after its initial launch - and following a somewhat shaky start - DICE has deployed the first major post-release patch for Battlefield 2042, looking to address some of its many issues. 
While foundational issues such as the lack of a scoreboard or in-game voice chat have been acknowledged, they&#x27;re not part of the first wave of patches. Instead, today&#x27;s update - named update two, following the day one patch that launched a week after the game was widely available (look, video game launches are complicated now) - instead introducing balancing and performance tweaks.

The fire, which had broken out in the ceiling of the ride&#x27;s indoor section, was spotted by a Universal Studios employee late on 23rd November, after guests had left the park for the day. According to the Fuji News Network (thanks Nintendo Life) emergency services were immediately contacted and no-one was harmed in the incident.

                    <span>Nintendo is bringing Mario Golf: Super Rush&#x27;s post-launch support to a close with one final free content update, available now on Switch.
Mario Golf: Super Rush teed off with enough of the good stuff to earn itself a Recommended badge back in June, but its launch line-up was bolstered with a free update in August - introducing Toadette, a New Donk City course, and more - and continued to expand in September, adding Koopa Troopa and Ninji as playable characters, Blustery Basin and Spiky Palms as new stages, alongside various other tweaks and improvements.

                    <span>Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, in which developer Yacht Club Games&#x27; iconic spade-bearer embarks on a colourful blend of falling-block puzzling and dungeon-crawling, finally has a release date and will be making its way to Switch, PlayStation, and PC on 13th December.
Announced back in the early part of 2020, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is a collaboration between Yacht Club Games and developer Vine that trades the titular hero&#x27;s previous bouts of acclaimed platform action for top-down puzzling and adventuring. The goal is to work through each single-screen stage by clearing groups of adjacent enemies - lining them up with a quick spade-thwack to create massive chain attacks - in order to progress to the next area.

                    <span>Fortnite Chapter 3 arrives next month, following a climactic live event to conclude the game&#x27;s second Chapter and wave farewell to its current, ever-changing Island map. 
Epic Games confirmed the timing for this season&#x27;s ending live event this afternoon - and acknowledged it would also bookend the game&#x27;s second Chapter. This backs up earlier rumours reported by Eurogamer that Epic planned to deploy Chapter 3 in December, rather than continuing Chapter 2 into a ninth season.

                    <span>I am, dear reader, a big fan of Nurgle. It&#x27;s an odd thing to be a fan of. The putrid Chaos faction is quite possibly the most disgusting thing in all of fantasy, but when it comes to Warhammer, disgusting can be cool. Sort of.
This week, developer Creative Assembly released a cinematic trailer for upcoming strategy game Total War: Warhammer 3, and it showcased Nurgle in all its puss-packed glory. I must say it&#x27;s just about the best Nurgle has looked in any video game ever.

Expeditions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, are effectively No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s stab at live-service-style seasonal content, offering limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the game&#x27;s ever-expanding systems into a series of progression-based challenges - with various cosmetic rewards served up as different milestones are reached.

                    <span>Men of War 2, the sequel to the original cult RTS Men of War, has been announced. It&#x27;s coming in 2022, and being developed by Ukrainian studio Best Way, the same studio behind the originals in the series: Men of War, which came out in 2009, and the proper first game in the series, 2004&#x27;s Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2.
We&#x27;ve seen some extended gameplay in action and had a walkthrough of some of the key features, and were pretty impressed with what we saw. In simple terms, imagine a Company of Heroes game with a bit more complexity to its systems (and maybe a smidge less budget).

Harmonix was founded in 1995 and began carving a rhythm-action niche for itself with the 2001 release of celebrated PS2-exclusive Frequency and its much-loved sequel Amplitude. 2005 saw the studio release Guitar Hero, arguably its most impactful game to date, which would go on to spawn a steady succession of sequels - although the developer would soon leave the series behind to expand on Guitar Hero&#x27;s plastic instrument premise with 2007&#x27;s Rock Band.

Party Spectacular, as season six is officially known, brings with it five new rounds, 25 new costumes, and a new 50-tier progression track with associated rewards. There&#x27;s also a special Sackboy-themed limited-time event, the return of custom usernames, the addition of cross-progression between PlayStation and PC, and more.

                    <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 sales aren&#x27;t great and Elite Dangerous: Odyssey under-performed, developer Frontier has said.
In a trading update, the Cambridge-based company said sales of Jurassic World Evolution 2 were &quot;lower than expected&quot; on the PC platform specifically. Frontier believes this is the &quot;short-term effect&quot; of a crowded release window, with a number of other highly-anticipated PC games launching in the same window.

                    <span>A new update for Skyrim Anniversary Edition fixes an issue with black screens.
Unfortunately it also breaks mods. What&#x27;s more, because the recently released Anniversary Edition is actually an upgrade to the previously released Special Edition, the update will affect owners of either version.

                    <span>Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has become the latest to condemn Activision Blizzard in a leaked internal email, following last week&#x27;s bombshell report which detailed allegations of sexual assault, harassment and misconduct at the company. 
Bowser&#x27;s note to employees follows similar emails sent last week by the chiefs of both PlayStation and Xbox, all of which expressed disappointment in Activision Blizzard&#x27;s latest scandal.

If you&#x27;ve yet to experience Rusty Lake&#x27;s deliciously surreal output - a collection of, so far, 15 games, all serving up a darkly atmospheric slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant - they&#x27;re well worth checking out.

                    <span>Rockstar has apologised for the &quot;unexpected&quot; technical issues plaguing its widely lambasted Grand Theft Auto: Trilogy - Definitive Edition release, promising to put the classic versions of the games back on sale on PC and making them free to owners of the remaster.
Rockstar&#x27;s Definitive Edition, developed by Grove Street Games, launched last week and immediately attracted ire for its myriad issues, including progression crashes, a widely documented procession of (admittedly sometimes hilarious) bugs, poor performance across all consoles, and a host of art concerns.

Starting with the free additions, Flight Simulator&#x27;s 1.21.12.0 update introduces a total of five new aircraft, some very different to those seen in the base game. The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, for instance, is Asobo&#x27;s first military jet, while the VoloCity is its first eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, capable of pinpoint landings and described as a taster for the proper arrival of helicopters in Flight Simulator next year.

Speaking to Eurogamer in a new interview, Joseph Staten, Head of Creative at 343 Industries, said the recent extension of Halo Infinite Season 1 to May 2022 means the releases of campaign co-op and Forge mode have also been pushed back from their initial announced target launch windows.

                    <span>Rowhammer is an attack technique involving accessing — that’s “hammering” — rows of bits in memory, millions of times per second, with the intent of causing bits in neighboring rows to flip. This is a side-channel attack, and the result can be all sorts of mayhem.
Well, there is a new enhancement:
All previous Rowhammer attacks have hammered rows with uniform patterns, such as single-sided, double-sided, or n-sided. In all three cases, these “aggressor” rows — meaning those that cause bitflips in nearby “victim” rows — are accessed the same number of times. ...</span>

                    <span>Cult classic platform star Earthworm Jim, first seen on Super Nintendo and Mega Drive back in the early 90s, is returning to television in a brand-new animated series.
As those of a certain age may recall, Earthworm Jim&#x27;s early video game success saw the space-faring invertebrate make the jump to television once before, way back in the mists of 1995 with an animated TV show that ran for two seasons and 23 episodes.

                    <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has written to staff saying he is &quot;evaluating all aspects&quot; of Xbox&#x27;s relationship with Activision Blizzard in light of a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming Activision CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.
In an email seen by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier - and later confirmed by Microsoft in a statement to IGN - Spencer told Xbox employees he and the gaming leadership team were &quot;disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions&quot; at Activision Blizzard, and that &quot;this type of behaviour has no place in our industry&quot;.

                    <span>Ninja Theory&#x27;s acclaimed 2017 action-adventure, Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice, has just received a new update, bringing August&#x27;s Xbox Series X enhancements over to PC. Additionally, a range of new accessibility features have been introduced to both versions.
The official description for Hellblade&#x27;s PC enhancements is a little vague, with Ninja Theory only promising &quot;enriched visuals&quot;, alongside DirectX Raytracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and AMD FSR support. However, the new PC release will almost certainly reflect the Xbox Series X version, which introduced the likes of upgraded materials, particles, and draw distances.

                    <span>Sifu, the striking martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, will be making its way to PlayStation and PC a little sooner than expected. Its arrival date has been revised to 8th February, a few weeks earlier than its originally anticipated 22nd February release.
Announcing the revised launch, Absolver explained it wanted to get Sifu into players hands a little sooner so they &quot;can enjoy playing [it] ahead of an incredibly big month for highly anticipated AAA releases&quot;. If Sifu had stuck to its original release date it would have been jostling up against the likes of Destiny 2&#x27;s The Witch Queen expansion, Horizon: Forbidden West, and the mighty Elden Ring.

                    <span>Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy, a surprisingly competent game for many, just got a heap of improvements with the latest update from Eidos-Montréal. 
Most notably, the update brings a ray-tracing mode to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and a hidden save rollback feature  to allow users who have encountered blocking issues to rollback to the start of the chapter of their choice (here&#x27;s how you can do it).

                    <span>Developer Mojang has announced that the long-awaited second part of Minecraft&#x27;s ambitious Caves &amp; Cliffs update will finally launch on 30th November for the Java and Bedrock editions of the game - meaning it&#x27;ll be coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4,  Switch, iOS, Android, Windows 10, Windows 11, MacOS, and Linux.
Minecraft&#x27;s Caves &amp; Cliffs update, you may recall, was initially unveiled during last October&#x27;s Minecon, with Mojang promising the likes of new cave types - complete with fresh blocks, mobs, and items - underground lakes and waterfalls to raft down, a new archaeology system, and, above ground, significantly more mountainous cliffs, complete with goats.

According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Ryan shared the email earlier today following the recent report by the Wall Street Journal which claimed Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.

Inspired by Steve Purcell&#x27;s cult comic series and first released in 2007, Beyond Time and Space once against follows the largely ludicrous adventures of crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam &amp; Max - who both made their video game debut 15 years earlier in LucasArts&#x27; point-and-click classic Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road - over the course of five episodes.

Eligible users should look for the cloud icon on supported titles in their console&#x27;s Game Pass catalogue. If present, a cloud version of the game can be launched for immediate play - perhaps to sample its wares or to quickly join a friend&#x27;s gaming session - without needing to download it first. Microsoft calls it a &quot;great way to discover your next favourite game while saving space on your hard drive for the games you plan to play again and again.&quot;

                    <span>Activision Blizzard staff have staged a new walkout in response to last night&#x27;s damning Wall St Journal report which detailed numerous alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment at the company - and suggested its boss Bobby Kotick had failed to fully act upon them.
Around 150 employees gathered outside the Blizzard campus in Irvine, California, after a call from the ABetterABK group which asked workers to down tools. A smaller protest was held at Blizzard&#x27;s QA office in Minnesota, while others joined in remotely, ceasing work elsewhere.

                    <span>Streamlabs yesterday announced the release of Streamlabs Studio, a new product that brings web-based Twitch streaming to Xbox and uses cloud capture to remove the need for capture cards.

Now, it has been accused of plagiarism from rival companies. Top streamers, including Pokimane, have also chimed in and threatened to move to other services.

                    <span>AWS offers its usual re:Invent justification letter to get your boss to let you attend re:Invent. As per my annual re:Quinnvent tradition, I’ve modified it slightly and sent it to my business partner: Dearest Mike Julian, I’d like your blessing and permission to attend AWS re:Invent 2021, Nov. 29 – Dec. 3 in Las Vegas.

                    <span>I received email from two people who told me that Microsoft Edge enabled synching without warning or consent, which means that Microsoft sucked up all of their bookmarks. Of course they can turn synching off, but it’s too late.
Has this happened to anyone else, or was this user error of some sort? If this is real, can some reporter write about it?
(Not that “user error” is a good justification. Any system where making a simple mistake means that you’ve forever lost your privacy isn’t a good one. We see this same situation with sharing contact lists with apps on smartphones. Apps will repeatedly ask, and only need you to accidentally click “okay” once.)...</span>

                    <span>As part of its Q3 interim report, publisher Paradox Interactive has offered an update on the beleaguered Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, saying it&#x27;s &quot;happy with the progress&quot; being made by the game&#x27;s still unknown new developer, but that it won&#x27;t be in a position to provide an updated release date for &quot;quite some time&quot;.
Back in October, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester admitted the publisher had almost scrapped Bloodlines 2 completely after its incredibly troubled development, which has seen the project hit with multiple delays and other controversies since its announcement back in 2019 - a sequence of events that ultimately lead to original developer Hardsuit Labs being removed from the project earlier this year.

                    <span>The other day I was creating a new account on the web. It was financial in nature, which means it gets one of my most secure passwords. I used PasswordSafe to generate this 16-character alphanumeric password:
:s^Twd.J;3hzg&#x3D;Q~

Which was rejected by the site, because it didn’t meet their password security rules.
It took me a minute to figure out what was wrong with it. They wanted at least two numbers.
Sheesh.
Okay, that’s not really why I don’t like password rules. I don’t like them because they’re all different. If someone has a strong password generation system, it is likely that whatever they come up with won’t pass somebody’s ruleset...</span>

                    <span>Battlefield is used to a bit of chaos - it&#x27;s at the series&#x27; core, after all, with manic moments in its sandbox what makes it stand out from other shooters - but the disarray of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s first weekend in the wilds has been hugely frustrating. Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I&#x27;ve endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable. This is another Battlefield that&#x27;s launching in a sorry state, and it&#x27;s up there with Battlefield 4&#x27;s infamously sorry start. From my own experience on Xbox Series X, it&#x27;s considerably worse. 
A lot of that frustration stems from setting aside Friday night to get stuck into DICE&#x27;s new shooter only to spend the whole evening butting up against a data persistent error that was, shall we say, persistent - across a whole night it was impossible to get into a single match of the All-Out Warfare that&#x27;s the core of this new Battlefield experience, and only the classic matches and rulesets of Portal offered any joy.

In the same breath, Rockstar removed the ability to buy the PC version of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition from its website.

Last year we announced that Dockershim is being deprecated: Dockershim Deprecation FAQ.
Our current plan is to remove dockershim from the Kubernetes codebase soon.
We are looking for feedback from you whether you are ready for dockershim
removal and to ensure that you are ready when the time comes.
Please fill out this survey: https://forms.gle/svCJmhvTv78jGdSx8.
The dockershim component that enables Docker as a Kubernetes container runtime is
being deprecated in favor of runtimes that directly use the Container Runtime Interface

                    <span>Star Wars&#x27; iconic bounty hunter Boba Fett is the latest character to up sticks and tumble awkwardly from the comfortable surroundings of their own franchise into the gaping, metaversal maw of Fortnite, and will be doing so this December.

Digital Extremes has previously called The New War, the &quot;most ambitious thing we&#x27;ve done&quot;.

The new locations popped up early last week, and come from the wider database of approved locations used by developer Niantic&#x27;s earlier game Ingress. (Pokémon Go has specific rules to limit the number of locations which filter through to it, to space out places on its map.)

It was fab and much-missed, and if a new report is to be believed, is now &quot;definitely&quot; set to make a a comeback.
That&#x27;s according to journalist (and reliable rumour-smith) Jeff Grubb, who discussed a new in-development take on 1 vs 100 as part of his Giant Bomb show. As reported by VGC, Grubb claimed the new project will be developed by Altspace VR - part of Microsoft&#x27;s Mixed Reality division - and will utilise the 3D avatars recently revealed for Microsoft Teams.

The sites served both iOS and MacOS exploit chains, but the researchers were only able to retrieve the MacOS one.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but Spider-Man is finally set to make his Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; debut - exclusively on PlayStation consoles, of course - at the end of this month, and developer Crystal Dynamics has offered a first proper look at the beleaguered live service game&#x27;s take on the character in a new cinematic trailer.
Spider-Man, who arrives somewhat later than his initially announced &quot;early&quot; 2021 release date, will make his Marvel&#x27;s Avenger&#x27;s debut alongside a new hero event, titled With Great Power, which sees Spidey joining forces with Black Widow and Ms. Marvel to try to stop a nefarious new AIM plan.

Make It Count adds new boss Maxim Zelnick, known as the Mob&#x27;s Fixer, to the existing 14-strong roster, alongside a range of other gameplay additions. Loan Sharks are in as a new racket type, for instance, providing a potentially lucrative new passive source of income - and potential new event-based complications if customers can&#x27;t afford afford to repay loans.

                    <span>Exo One - which we&#x27;ve had our eye on now for almost five years - will finally launch next week for PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 18th November. 
A vast and beautiful sci-fi exploration game, Exo One is the work of developer Jay Weston. You control a mysterious gleaming spacecraft that can be rolled around planets like a sci-fi Wii Sports Golf ball, or soar through the air like a flying saucer.

                    <span>YouTube has announced plans to hide the dislike count for videos, and is now slowly rolling out the change across its platform. 
A dislike button will still be shown to all, and a channel owner will still be able to privately view the number of dislikes on a particular video. The only change is that the count will no longer be public.

                    <span>Sony has reportedly reduced its production forecast for the PlayStation 5 again because of &quot;component and logistics constraints&quot;.
Sony had previously targeted more than 16m units assembled in the year ending March, but that has now been cut to 15m units, according to Bloomberg sources. This will make its target of 14.8m PS5 sales by March more difficult.

                    <span>Some cheats have been removed from the GTA&#x27;s remastered trilogy due to technical reasons.
Back in the day, players had plenty of fun with cheat codes in the original games, from adding infinite health, to netting a bank load of cash, and even tanks falling from the skies.

&quot;You know, it&#x27;s great to have celebrities, it&#x27;s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,&quot; Keighley said. &quot;What we really learned last year was at the end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.&quot;

                    <span>After months of rumours, the world of Naruto has now been officially confirmed as coming to Fortnite.
The enormously-popular anime has long been top of fans&#x27; wishlists for characters to include in Epic&#x27;s battle royale. Earlier this year, rumours persisted that Epic was attempting to negotiate the rights - and that at one point Mr. Naruto himself was part of a seasonal battle pass.

                    <span>Image &amp; Form is returning to its critically acclaimed SteamWorld universe with SteamWorld Headhunter, a brand-new new co-operative action-adventure that sees the series moving into 3D for the very first time. But that&#x27;s not all! The developer has also announced a release date for its gloopy third-person sci-fi adventure, The Gunk, which will be heading to Xbox One, Xbox One Series X/S, and PC on 16th December.
SteamWorld Headhunter, to deal with the newcomer first, is the sixth entry in Image &amp; Form&#x27;s celebrated SteamWorld series - following on from SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Heist, SteamWorld Dig 2, and SteamWorld Quest - and once again looks to offer a radical shake-up for the series.

                    <span>Valve has announced a delay for Steam Deck; the portable gaming PC will no longer begin shipping at the end of this year as intially planned, and will now start making its way to customers in February 2022.
Those that successfully managed to surmount some early technical hitches and join the front of the queue when Steam Deck reservations opened back in July were originally due to receive their hardware in December this year. Unfortunately, those Christmases will now be just a little less merry thanks to disruptions in production caused by a lack of available parts.

All three GTA titles included in the remaster bundle have, of course, been impacted by music licensing issues in the past, leading to a number of tracks being omitted when the games were later re-released for iOS and Android, PS3 and PS4, and PC.

The two exploits are particularly notable due to the level of access they theoretically give to the PS5’s software. Decrypted firmware ­ which is possible through Fail0verflow’s keys ­ would potentially allow for hackers to further reverse engineer the PS5 software and potentially develop the sorts of hacks that allowed for things like installing Linux, emulators, or even pirated games on ...</span>

                    <span>As one of Bethesda&#x27;s biggest and most beloved series, it&#x27;s not much of a revelation to hear the company is already mulling over a new Fallout instalment, but studio director Todd Howard has now talked a little about a potential new series entry, confirming that while an idea exists, Fallout 5 is still a long way off.
Speaking to IGN as part of a Skyrim 10th anniversary retrospective, Howard explained that currently the studio has a &quot;one-pager&quot; for Fallout 5, outlining what it wants to do with the series. However, sci-fi adventure Starfield, due to release next year, and The Elder Scrolls 6 - which was still in its design phase as of June this year - remain the studio&#x27;s priority, meaning it could be years before work on the next Fallout begins in earnest.
