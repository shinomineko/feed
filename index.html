                              <span>Fall Guys players believe it&#x27;s now quicker to level up your battle pass if you lose rather than win.

That&#x27;s because of the game&#x27;s all new progression and monetisation systems that were introduced when the game switched to a free-to-play model earlier this week.

As spotted by Gamerant, players can still level up their battle pass, but with new daily, weekly, and long-term challenges also now available, it seems as though maximising those will help you progress faster than winning matches... and given the time it takes to secure a winning crown, you could potentially earn the same amount of Fame more quickly just by crashing out in early rounds.

                              <span>Skull &amp; Bones has been rated by the ERSB, leading some to hope that a release date may be imminent. 

The news follows rating board confirmations in other parts of the world, too, including Brazil and Australia, and a leak of Skull &amp; Bones&#x27; four-minute tutorial video back in April, which Ubisoft eventually confirmed was real.

The description shared on the ESRB website is the closest we&#x27;ve come to getting an idea of what the game - which is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox Series - entails since it underwent &quot;extensive reworking&quot; a couple of years back.

That&#x27;s according to Dealabs poster billbil-kun, who - as ever - has the scoop on what titles are next heading to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus free game line-up next month. 

Though we have to take this with the usual pinch of proverbial salt, billbil-kun has been ahead of Sony&#x27;s formal announcement many, many times now, and hasn&#x27;t been wrong thus far.

                              <span>Riot Games has confirmed that from 13th July, it will begin collecting &quot;in-game voice communications&quot; in North America in a bid to combat &quot;disruptive behaviour&quot;.

In a brief update on Valorant&#x27;s offical website, Riot Games explained that as part of its &quot;larger effort to combat disruptive behaviour&quot;, the company has updated its Privacy Notice and Terms of Service to allow recording and evaluation of in-game voice communications.

The post stresses that these recordings will only be evaluated when &quot;a report for [negative] behaviour is submitted&quot; and the system will originally kick off in Valorant before - once the &quot;tech [is] in a good enough place&quot; - it will be rolled out to other games.

                              <span>Former Sega of America president and founding member of Sony Computer Entertainment America, Bernie Stolar, has died aged 75 years old. 

According to GamesBeat, Stolar - whose career started in 1980 when he set up his own coin-op arcade company - died in California. He had always been a very candid and transparent executive who talked openly about his triumphs and mistakes over the years.

&quot;I loved working for Sony,&quot; Stolar once said, according to GB. &quot;I really did. But when the opportunity came up to go to Sega and help rebuild the business and come up with new hardware, I was very interested in doing it. I wouldn’t have left Sony if I hadn’t also lived in fear of getting fired along with everyone else, though.

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has outlined its plans on tackling cheating in the popular augmented-reality mobile game.

In an update posted to the company&#x27;s official blog (thanks, NME), Niantic said it is &quot;continuously work[ing] to facilitate a fun and fair environment&quot; and &quot;[felt players&#x27;] frustration about how cheating behaviours&quot; affected them. 

Its last post on cheating - posted way back last year - was &quot;focused primarily on sharing a broad overview&quot; on the topic, but since then, Niantic says it&#x27;s &quot;becoming better&quot; at spotting cheaters.

Whilst it&#x27;s &quot;mostly a modding-focused update&quot;, creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone says there &quot;will be some new content&quot;, but advised players to temper expectations, as it &quot;won&#x27;t be huge&quot;.

Asked if his follow-up game, Haunted Chocolatier, will have references to the wholesome farming sim, Barone said that there would be, but said he didn&#x27;t know &quot;how deep the connection will be&quot; as he&#x27;s keen for his upcoming title to &quot;have its own identity&quot;.

Nacho Requena - editor of Spanish games magazine, Manual - teased in a recent Twitch stream that new announcements - this time from major publishers about third-party games - is slated for this coming Tuesday, 28th June 2022.

&quot;We should have a Nintendo Direct this coming Tuesday,&quot; Requena reportedly said, as translated by VGC. &quot;This will be mainly focused on third-party games – that’s what I’ve been told to expect.

As spotted by Gematsu (thanks, PC Gamer), back in 2018, studio boss Hidetaka Miyazaki said that &quot;3.5&quot; of the games the team was currently working on were unannounced, and 4Gamer reached out to ask Miyazaki on their progress. 

Since that time, we&#x27;ve had Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, PSVR game, Déraciné, and Elden Ring, of course. That leaves just one mysterious game yet to be announced, which may or may not be that heavily-rumoured Armored Core instalment.

According to  Michsuzuki and spotted and translated by our friends at VGC, Square Enix&#x27;s CEO Yosuke Matsuda confirmed at the company&#x27;s recent Shareholders&#x27; Meeting that it was &quot;too early to make Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy blockchain games&quot;, emphasising that he was &quot;not thinking about that&quot; for upcoming releases. 

VGC also purports that the company is keen to create &quot;story-focused&quot; NFTs, too.

The USB controller is based upon the Cyber Stick and offers analogue controls for compatible games on Sega&#x27;s diminutive system. As demonstrated in yesterday&#x27;s announcement livestream, like its 90s predecessor, it&#x27;ll feature a throttle, stick, and the ability to suit both right- and left-handed players. 

The Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 itself will retail for around half the price of this newly-announced peripheral (thanks, Famitsu).

                              <span>Earlier this month, I and others wrote a letter to Congress, basically saying that cryptocurrencies are an complete and total disaster, and urging them to regulate the space. Nothing in that letter is out of the ordinary, and is in line with what I wrote about blockchain in 2019. In response, Matthew Green has written—not really a rebuttal—but a “a general response to some of the more common spurious objections…people make to public blockchain systems.” In it, he makes several broad points:
Yes, current proof-of-work blockchains like bitcoin are terrible for the environment. But there are other modes like proof-of-stake that are not.

                              <span>Bungie and a number of PlayStation studios, including Insoniac and Sucker Punch, have spoken out in support of reproductive rights following today&#x27;s decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn key legislation granting individuals the constitutional right to choose an abortion - a move that gives US states the power to either severely restrict or ban the practice.


Bungie was one of the first studios to make a statement in May after the US Supreme Court&#x27;s plans to overthrow Roe v Wade were leaked to the press, calling the move a &quot;direct attack on human rights&quot;. Adding to that sentiment in a new statement shared today, it said, &quot;Standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values.&quot;


&quot;Last month, we stated without reservation that all of us deserve to choose our own path and access the healthcare we need,&quot; the developer continued. &quot;The decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade cuts off millions of Americans from that access and leaves open the possibility of even further restrictions on life-saving healthcare for all of us.&quot;

Right at the bottom of the catalogue is a section called &quot;Last chance to play&quot;. Currently there are two games listed: PS4 game Shadow Warrior 3 and PS3 game Syberia.


The former is set to leave the Extra catalogue on 5th July 2022 - although it&#x27;s been on PS Now since 1st March - while the latter will leave Premium on 19th July 2022.

                              <span>The first trailer for Final Fantasy 16 introduced lead characters Clive and Joshua, as well as a cute dog. Now, that dog has a name.


Producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed to IGN that the dog is named Torgal and he may even be a party member.


&quot;Well, let&#x27;s just say he&#x27;s more wolf than dog - and his name is &#x27;Torgal&#x27;,&quot; said Yoshida. &quot;As for him being a party member, you&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. We&#x27;ll have more info on parties soon.&quot;

                              <span>Bungie is suing the perpetrator behind a series of fake Destiny 2 DMCA takedowns for $7.7m.


Earlier in March this year, a number of top Destiny 2 YouTubers - and even Bungie itself - were struck with a fake DMCA takedown from an unknown user.


Bungie has since identified and filed a lawsuit against the user, named Nicholas Minor a.k.a Lord Nazo.

And, of course, the company has not missed out on a golden opportunity to remind us all of its many IPs, from Horizon and Uncharted to Bloodborne, Ghost of Tsushima and more. 
The new trailer, which is simply called Mr. Malcom, takes us on a journey into a &quot;mystifying and intriguing world, showcasing the lives that anyone can live, through wonderful gaming experiences&quot;. It all starts off seemingly benign, with the titular Mr Malcom enjoying a meal out before buying himself some nice juicy meat from the butcher. 
However, it soon becomes more and more surreal, as Mr. Malcom makes his way home and back to his eclectic collection. Also, that meat I just mentioned... it wasn&#x27;t actually for him. You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has admitted the recent trailer for the game was delayed due to the war in Ukraine.


Speaking to Japanese site Dengeki Online (spotted by VGC), Yoshida feared the subject matter of the game would be inappropriate due to ongoing world events.


&quot;Actually, it was ready to be released in March, but at the same time, Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine made the world situation unstable,&quot; said Yoshida.

Players who wish to see another player banned due to misconduct will have to send a ban request to Mojang. This will need to include a valid reason for the request.

However, it has replaced a fan-created version that&#x27;s now available only as an add-on, meaning it&#x27;s impossible to access without purchasing the Nightdive Studios edition first.

A recent company filing revealed Yves Guillemot chose to forgo about a third of his annual compensation (via Axios), equating to a pay cut of €310k (approximately £266k / $327k). 
An Ubisoft spokesperson told Axios this was a &quot;personal decision by Yves Guillemot, which he took considering that the company had not reached the financial targets that it had publicly communicated to the markets&quot;.

                              <span>One of the developers of the recently released Sonic Origins has hit out at publisher Sega, alleging &quot;what is in Origins is also not what we turned in&quot;.

Simon &quot;Stealth&quot; Thomley, of Sonic Origins developer Headcannon, took to Twitter to accuse Sega of introducing &quot;wild bugs&quot; into the game. 


Headcannon was responsible for the well-received 2017 platformer Sonic Mania and assisted Sega with the development of Sonic Origins, which was released on multiple platforms this week.

The idea is that these new Spartan Points will take the place of the Season Points that currently exist in the game, and which allow players to purchase various cosmetics by completing challenges and the like.
Don&#x27;t worry unduly, however.

                              <span>Actor Chris Pratt has been discussing his - somewhat controversial - role in the upcoming CGI Super Mario Bros. movie, telling Variety that his take on the title character will be &quot;updated and unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world before.&quot;


Mario has, of course, been voiced by Charles Martinet since 1992, and his video game performance has become inseparable from Nintendo&#x27;s flagship character. As such, Mario fans were somewhat aghast last year when Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto announced Pratt would be replacing Martinet as the voice of Mario in the upcoming film.


It&#x27;s a casting decision that few seemed to have warmed to even ten months on, despite the best efforts of Chris Meledandri, producer of the Super Mario film, who insisted Pratt&#x27;s performance as Mario was &quot;phenomenal&quot; last November. Meledandri then defended his star again this week, saying criticism of Pratt&#x27;s casting would &quot;evaporate&quot; when people heard his performance.

                              <span>Four and a bit years after its initial launch, FTL developer Subset Games is revisiting its stellar turn-based strategy game Into the Breach, with a much-expanded Advanced Edition update for existing platforms that&#x27;s set to release on 19th July.


Into the Breach&#x27;s Advanced Edition update - which will be free to all existing owners on Switch, Mac, and PC - introduces new squads, weapons, pilots (with new pilot abilities), enemies, bosses, missions, and new music from Ben Prunty. It&#x27;ll also include a new, more challenging difficulty mode, plus support for seven new languages.


Alongside the update for existing platforms, Into the Breach will also be making its iOS and Android debut on 19th July. This version will include the new Advanced Edition content and touch-screen support, but will only be available to Netflix subscribers as part of the streaming service&#x27;s gradual move into gaming.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the majestic rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, is expanding again, this time introduing a huge number of new accessibility features, including an adjustable assist mode, in a PC and console update the studios are calling Breaking Barriers.


Evil Empire first discussed improving Dead Cells&#x27; accessibility back in January, when it began canvassing players for feedback on how it could expand the game to better suit a wide range of needs. It then shared an update on its progress in May, detailing some of the accessibility options that were on the way.


After a round of beta testing, all that work has now been moved to the live game with the official launch of Breaking Barriers. The update brings an huge range of new accessibility features - tested by a panel of players with various disabilities at AbleGamers - all of which have been detailed in a lengthy new blog post and nine-minute video breakdown.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - we look in detail at today&#x27;s final rollout of PlayStation Plus Premium, which is now available in the UK and mainland Europe.

We now know all of the games included in the PlayStation Plus Premium catalogue at launch and it&#x27;s enough to hit Sony&#x27;s promises, certainly, though there are still odd omissions. The lack of 60Hz for some PS1 games (for now) also points to a rather rushed release, despite the extra weeks we&#x27;ve waited on these shores.

So, what can Sony do to build on this launch and improve the new PlayStation Plus Premium further? And, after all that, have we ended up subscribing ourselves? Eurogamer&#x27;s Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 18th October, developer Asobo and publisher Focus Entertainment have announced. 


A cloud-only version will also be available for Nintendo Switch, and as previously announced the game will launch into Xbox Game Pass for Xbox, PC and cloud on day one.


Today also brings 10 minutes of newly-revealed gameplay, as siblings Amicia and Hugo return, happy to use their tricks to remove any soldiers in sight. It&#x27;s a nice showcase of the game&#x27;s stealthy combat, if nothing else, and yes - those rats are back.

&quot;Xbox has been supporting keyboard and mouse for a few years now, and we&#x27;re working on adding it to streaming for PC users,&quot; explained Microsoft&#x27;s Morgan Brown in a new game dev video (via The Verge). &quot;But you can start adding it to your game right now and your console keyboard and mouse users will appreciate it. It will light up in streaming once we&#x27;ve finished adding it.&quot;

                              <span>Blizzard has detailed its plans for Overwatch&#x27;s existing currencies and lootboxes as the developer looks to the launch of Overwatch 2 as a free-to-play early access game this October.


As announced previously, Overwatch 2 will not contain any loot boxes, with items instead made available for purchase directly instead. 


Writing in a reddit AMA last night, Blizzard explained that any unopened loot boxes would be automatically redeemed ahead of Overwatch 2&#x27;s launch.

Now, Sonic creator Yuji Naka has confirmed that Michael Jackson did indeed write music for the game.


&quot;Does Sonic Origins Sonic 3 have a different song?&quot; he tweeted out of the blue. &quot;Oh my god, the music for Sonic 3 has changed, even though Sega Official uses Michael Jackson&#x27;s music.&quot;

                              <span>If an entire universe in the palm of your hand sounds neat, you&#x27;re probably already excited about the launch of exploratory space sim No Man&#x27;s Sky on Switch. And it turns out the wait for its arrival won&#x27;t go on too much longer, with developer Hello Games having now confirmed it&#x27;ll be coming to Nintendo&#x27;s console - initially as a single-player-only experience - on 7th October.


No Man&#x27;s Sky, of course, launched for PC and PS4 back in the summer of 2016, giving players an entire procedural universe to explore as their whims took them. That initial version memorably came in for some criticism, but Hello Games has continued to expand on the game&#x27;s solid survival core since then, delivering over 19, often significant, free updates.


These have introduced the likes of base building, bobbleheads, farming, giant customisable space freighters, land and water vehicles, pilotable mechs, living ships, alien-infested space derelicts, new flora and fauna, pets, live-service-style community expeditions, music tools, sand worms, and more - all of which should be included at launch on Switch.

The game, which is known as Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City - The Board Game, comes from a collaboration with CMON, whose other works include Zombicide, Blood Rage, The Others, Rising Sun, Massive Darkness and Arcadia Quest, to name but a few. 
It sees up to four players taking on the role of the ruthless gangs vying for control in the &quot;glittering hellhole&quot; of Night City (much as the name suggests).

At present, viewing the different game categories on Twitch brings up a grid view of various streams that need to be clicked on individually to view.


The new version being tested adds a video at the top which auto-plays as users click through the grid of streams beneath, before choosing to join the stream or follow the streamer.

                              <span>Bandai Namco Europe has revealed Taiko no Tatsujin Rhythm Festival will be marching its way onto the Nintendo Switch on 14th October.
And that&#x27;s not all. The developer has also revealed that those who purchase the Taiko Drum Set edition will not only get the base game but the playable drums as well (ok, the clue was in the title with that one). 
You can check out the trailer for Taiko no Tatsujin Rhythm Festival below.

                              <span>Sony has exceeded the number of games made available as part of its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogues by a decent margin.


Fans had been eyeing the service&#x27;s slow roll-out over the course of the past month through different countries around the world - until its final deployment in the UK and mainland Europe today. 


Ahead of time, Sony had promised &quot;up to 400&quot; PlayStation 4 and PS5 games would be available to both PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers - though the initial launch in Asia fell well short. Eurogamer&#x27;s list of PS4 and PS5 games available today comes to 429.

                              <span>Elden Ring has already inspired countless mods and fan videos, including a playable demake on a Game Boy.




Now, Youtube channel 64 Bits has released a demake video of what Elden Ring would look like on a SNES. Spoiler: it looks fantastic.


Of course, it takes a top-down viewpoint akin to classic RPGs (the video notes Secret of Mana, Terranigma, and Final Fantasy 6 as inspiration), with a cute little Tarnished defeating various iconic bosses with melee weapons and magic.

                              <span>We know Sonic goes fast - he is, after all, a blue spikey blur of a hedgehog more often than not. But now, he has sped past one of his most impressive milestones yet and made Paramount a cool $400m at the box office. 
The film is currently the eighth-biggest film launch worldwide this year, but, as Deadline reports, this place is likely to jump up a few notches with the film still to release in both Hong Kong and Japan. 
These numbers are a pretty impressive sight, but perhaps not unexpected. After all, Sonic 2 reportedly enjoyed the greatest opening weekend for any video-game based movie ever on its release in April.

                              <span>PSP classic Super Stardust Portable has been quietly added to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Premium games list, though is currently a little difficult to find. 


The handheld shoot &#x27;em-up, originally launched in 2008, can be found by searching directly for the title in the PlayStation Store (thanks to reddit user Turb0_Thunder).


You won&#x27;t find it (yet) via the Classic Catalogue menu, although it&#x27;s unclear if this is because it&#x27;s not due to go live yet, or a deliberate secret. (Either way, PlayStation&#x27;s store interface isn&#x27;t the clearest to filter and search through.)

However, many of its Classic Catalogue PlayStation 1 games are available only in their PAL 50Hz versions - a slower standard superceded by the NTSC 60Hz option available elsewhere. 


This morning, Sony said it will provide &quot;NTSC options for a majority&quot; of these games in the future - though not detailed when or for which games.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good while since Square Enix&#x27;s troubled live-service action-adventure Marvel&#x27;s Avengers got itself a new playable hero - its most recent addition was the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man at the end of last year - but that drought will finally come to an end next Tuesday, 28th June, with the arrival of Jane Foster&#x27;s Mighty Thor.


When developer Crystal Dynamics first confirmed Foster was to be Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; next playable hero, the studio said the character would have &quot;a lot in common&quot; with the version of Thor already in-game, albeit with &quot;elements that are distinctly Jane&quot;.


Crystal Dynamics has since expanded on that, revealing Foster will arrive with a few new baseline abilities setting her apart from Odinson, including a new ranged combo and new ranged power attack. There&#x27;s also her new Intrinsic ability (All-Mother&#x27;s Blessing), a new Overcharge ability (God Tempest), and a new Ultimate ability (All-Weapon) enabling her to smite foes using both the Undrjarn and Mjölnir.

                              <span>Despite running into some considerable set-backs shortly after its initial announcement, leading to an indefinite delay, developer Nightdive Studios&#x27; highly anticipated remaster of Westwood Studio&#x27;s classic Blade Runner point-and-click adventure is finally complete, and will be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, tomorrow, 23rd June.


The Blade Runner game, for those unfamiliar, released in 1997, and, unlike the vast majority of licensed adaptations, was an extraordinary piece of work, not only managing to perfectly capture the neon-streaked dystopian atmosphere of the movie in a story that ran parallel to its action, but doing so in ways both wildly ambitious and legitimately groundbreaking.


Although Blade Runner takes its cue from narrative-driven point-and-click games, it immediately distinguishes itself from its genre peers by sending players, in the role of Blade Runner Ray McCoy, on a heavily randomised adventure. The goal remains the same each play-through, in that players must use their investigatory skills to identify and hunt down a number of replicants, but exactly which characters are replicants is determined at the start of a new game, subtly changing their behaviour as the story unfolds.

                              <span>Developer Creative Assembly has finally unmasked Hyenas, its long-in-the-works sci-fi shooter - and while Alien Isolation fans might be a little disappointed to see it&#x27;s not a much-hoped for successor, anyone who&#x27;s ever dreamed of doing heists in a space should be very cheerful.


Creative Assembly first revealed it was working on a sci-fi shooter back in September 2018, calling it an &quot;ambitious multiplayer title&quot; and a &quot;fresh take on the FPS genre&quot; that would enable players to &quot;embrace a variety of creative playstyles&quot;. Almost four years later, that project has now been named as Hyenas, a &quot;ballsy entry into the most competitive genre in gaming&quot;.


&quot;In Hyenas, the world is broken... literally,&quot; explains Creative Assembly. &quot;The billionaires have finally made it to Mars, leaving Earth and those tax bills far behind. The zero-gravity tech that powered their journey has shattered our planet, abandoning us in a drifting slum called the &#x27;Taint&#x27;. The only thing the rich care for is rare Merch, pop culture swag from the lives we left behind, which they loot from the rubble to furnish their Martian mansions.&quot;

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has said it has no current plans to remove the option of battling in raids from afar - a popular mechanic introduced in response to Covid lockdowns. 


Some fans had feared the concept would be cut - as other pandemic-era bonuses and gameplay have already been - especially as Niantic recently announced a new in-person only raid variety, which will debut this weekend for the game&#x27;s next Community Day.


&quot;That&#x27;s a unique experience that we&#x27;re setting up just for these extra bonuses in Community Day,&quot; Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka told me today, referring to the bonuses players will get to extend their local Community Day experience by taking part in the game&#x27;s new in-person-only event raids.

                              <span>An Elden Ring player has accidentally stumbled on an unknown - and invisible - boss thanks to a randomiser mod.


YouTuber MythyMoo used an item and boss randomiser mod that mixes up the placement of acquired items and bosses, which can massively impact the difficulty of a run. The mod also mixes up the names of each boss.


Except, as PCGamesN reports, things took a turn when MythyMoo arrived in the Consecrated Snowfield, an area with various field bosses.

Youtuber Vadim M found the code buried in the recently remastered  Vice City: Definitive Edition.


What&#x27;s interesting is that the code isn&#x27;t on the original retail copy of the game, hence why it was only just discovered.

                              <span>The Epic Games Store has launched its own version of user reviews and tags, via randomised game ratings and polls it hopes will avoid the kinds of review bombing seen frequently on Steam. 


The ability to rate a game on a five-star scale will be randomly offered to owners of that title who have played it for more than two hours. 


&quot;Because these requests are randomised, we won&#x27;t spam our players, and we probably won&#x27;t ask about every game or app used,&quot; Epic Games&#x27; Craig Pearson explained. &quot;This approach protects games from review bombing and ensures people assigning scores are actual players of the games.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo presented a deep dive into the imminent JRPG epic Xenoblade Chronicles in today&#x27;s focussed Direct presentation, revealing an expansion pass that unlocks helpful items and outfits upon the game&#x27;s release next month and that will provide access to a new story scenario that&#x27;s set to launch before the end of 2023. 


There was plenty more shown off, with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 thankfully dialling back some of the anime excesses of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - there was not a single improbably proportioned sidekick to be seen - while restoring some of the scale and wonder of Xenoblade Chronicles X. 


Set on the planet of Aionios, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set against a backdrop of warring factions from the nations of Keves and Agnos, and a world in which people have pre-determined lifespans of 10 years. Your party is drawn from three characters from each side who&#x27;ve put their differences aside - and opening up a broader, deeper take on combat that&#x27;s rich with systems.

Some players take their cosmetic inventory very seriously, which they can buy and sell for hundreds of pounds.


Now one unfortunate collector claims their entire inventory - worth an estimated $2m - has been stolen by hackers (thanks, PCGamesN).

On Monday, Vips streamed Call of Duty: Warzone with fellow Red Bull junior driver Liam Lawson. As has been clipped, Vips cursed and said the n-word, to which Lawson replied &quot;Juri!&quot; and laughed.


Lawson also asked Vips to wear a pink Red Bull cap, to which he replied &quot;No, that&#x27;s gay&quot;. Lawson responded: &quot;Juri, you can&#x27;t say that&quot;.

                              <span>Pokémon Go will add its first new Pokéball in years, and it&#x27;s a fan-favourite design from the Nintendo Switch games Pokémon Sun and Moon.


The Beast Ball is a galactic-looking version of the regular Pokéball designed specifically for capturing Ultra Beasts, the extra-dimensional creatures which featured in Sun and Moon (and most recently arrived in Pokémon Go) via creepy wormholes.


Players at Pokémon Go&#x27;s three big in-person gatherings in Berlin, Seattle and Sapporo this summer will be first to use Beast Balls over the next six weeks, and get first access to one of the next three Ultra Beasts to arrive.

                              <span>After last season&#x27;s King Kong x Godzilla battle, Activision&#x27;s flagship battle royale gets even wackier with an appearance of The Terminator. 


Better yet, you&#x27;re spoiled for choice, with Season four of Warzone giving you the option to play as the orginal T-800 or its succesor the T-1000 (Schwarzenegger voice lines not included).


Activision being Activision, the two Terminators are not bundled together, but rather as seperate time-limited packs.

                              <span>A new update for Gran Turismo 7 lands early tomorrow, bringing three new cars previously teased as well as the surprise introduction of a track that&#x27;s entirely new to Polyphony Digital&#x27;s series. 


Watkins Glen International is a staple of the US racing scene, playing host to F1 until it was deemed unsafe after a series of fatal accidents. It&#x27;s a ramshackle kind of place that now plays host to the likes of IMSA and NASCAR, and it&#x27;s an absolute delight to drive either of the configurations that are on offer in Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s take on the track. 


There&#x27;s a trio of new cars too, with a brace of Suzukis including a new fictional &#x27;Vision&#x27; car alongside the iconic V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special (now how about putting Pikes Peak in the game, seeing as Gran Turismo&#x27;s been squatting on the official licence for the legendary course for a while?).

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 will include party members in combat, despite the fact that recent trailers have focused solely on protagonist Clive.


Fans have speculated whether other characters will join battles, which producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed to IGN - although they will remain AI-controlled.


&quot;We didn&#x27;t want to overwhelm users in our newest trailer, so we focused solely on Clive&#x27;s battles. That said, for most of his journey, Clive will be accompanied by one or more companions. These companions will participate in battle, as well as trade banter with Clive. That said, the party members will be AI-driven so as to allow players to focus solely on controlling Clive,&quot; said Yoshida.

                              <span>Naoki Yoshida has said he was worried about taking on Final Fantasy 16 while continuing his work as producer and director on MMORPG Final Fantasy 14.


In a PlayStation Blog interview, the Final Fantasy 16 producer describes how he was honoured to be offered the opportunity to work on a single-player game in the series, but thought fans may criticise him.



&quot;I said &#x27;Thanks, but I have my hands full with Final Fantasy 14, so let me think about it.&#x27; I was truly honoured that the company would choose my section, Creative Business Unit 3, to be responsible for making the next entry in the FF series. But, as you probably know, I&#x27;m already the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14. I was worried that if I took on the directorship of 16, too, fans of both games would have good reason to believe I wasn&#x27;t giving either project my full attention,&quot; said Yoshida.

Doubling down on its commitment to the Battlefield franchise - and fixing the recent embattled Battlefield 2042 in particular - DICE has ruled out a return for any of its other franchises for now.


Speaking to Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, DICE&#x27;s recently-appointed general manager Rebecka Coutaz confirmed any project such as Mirror&#x27;s Edge was currently sat on the backburner.

Players can now finally start Horizon Stories with friends in co-op, a feature that was strangely omitted from the game at launch and even stranger given the social nature of the game. 


Previously, players in a convoy would be booted off when the host starts a story mission.

                              <span>PlayStation is the latest big company to announce it will skip Gamescom this year. 


The annual European show, held in Cologne, was traditionally the world&#x27;s largest in terms of visitors. This summer will see Gamescom return as a physical event for the first time since 2019, albeit with fewer publishers in attendance. 

PlayStation confirmed its decision to skip Gamescom 2022 in a statement to German publication Games Wirtschaft (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), where it also confirmed it would not feature any announcements in the show&#x27;s Geoff Keighley-fronted livestream Opening Night Live.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 will not have an open world.


Producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed the news in an interview with IGN, although he said that recent open world games have provided &quot;inspiration&quot;.


&quot;We&#x27;ve found in our extensive user research that many of the younger generation of gamers have never played a Final Fantasy or don&#x27;t have any interest in the series. To create a game that might excite and resonate not only with our core fans, but also with that new generation, we played a lot of games ourselves, and so yes, in [Final Fantasy 16] you&#x27;ll find inspiration from recent triple-A open world RPGs,&quot; said Yoshida.

                              <span>Yesterday, players were left unable to find matches in Fall Guys thanks to server issues sparked by the game&#x27;s multiplatform relaunch. 


Developer Mediatonic first acknowledged the issues yesterday afternoon, in a fashionably Fall Guys-style tweet.


Late last night, things seemed to be improving, with more players able to get into game. But still there were  &quot;teething issues&quot;, as servers were flooded with new players across PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Valve has issued a new update for Team Fortress 2, a month after acknowledging a high-profile fan campaign that highlighted the current state of the game. 


A &quot;peaceful protest&quot; to &quot;#SaveTF2&quot; was organised by fans in May to raise awareness of the game&#x27;s many bugs, its ongoing bot problems, and the general lack of updates by Valve despite TF2&#x27;s ongoing popularity.


In response, Valve said it had heard the game&#x27;s community. &quot;We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things,&quot; it wrote shortly after.

Producer Naoki Yoshida has spoken in multiple interviews about the game, divulging new information about its conception.


&quot;When it came to deciding what to do with Final Fantasy 16, I thought back to when I played the original Final Fantasy, and remembered how I felt like I was playing the leading role in a motion picture,&quot; he said in a new PlayStation Blog post.

                              <span>Interesting:
What makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware that we usually come across, is that it needs to infect other running processes to inflict damage on infected machines. Instead of being a standalone executable file that is run to infect a machine, it is a shared object (SO) library that is loaded into all running processes using LD_PRELOAD (T1574.006), and parasitically infects the machine. Once it has infected all the running processes, it provides the threat actor with rootkit functionality, the ability to harvest credentials, and remote access capability...</span>

                              <span>Following its conspicuously release-window-free unveiling back in April, Blizzard has now confirmed World of Warcraft&#x27;s Dragonflight expansion will launch later this year.


Dragonflight, as detailed in Blizzard&#x27;s April reveal stream, will give players access to the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind, known as the Dragon Isles, introducing four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, Ohn’ahran Plains, Azure Span, and Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also adds the Dracthyr Evokers - a new playable race-class hybrid that can, depending on a players&#x27; chosen class specialisations, focus on either damage dealing or healing - plus a new skill-based flight system tied to customisable dragon companions.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve a proposal that the company should publish an annual report detailing the effectiveness and outcomes of its efforts to prevent abuse, harassment, and discrimination in its workplace - a non-binding vote Activision has, as yet, only said it will &quot;carefully consider&quot;.


The proposal, originally raised by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in February, requested that Activision publically release an annual report detailing several key metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company&#x27;s progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.


While this kind of transparency might seem prudent given the shocking allegations that have surfaced in relation to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s workplace practices over the last year, and given that the publisher remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last July&#x27;s State of California filing, which called the company a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - the company&#x27;s board of directors instead wrote to shareholders in May unanimously urging them to vote against the proposal.

                              <span>After more than five years of development, Redbeet Interactive&#x27;s enormously enjoyable open water survival adventure Raft has just received its full version 1.0 release, bringing, among other things, the final chunk of its exploratory story campaign.


Raft, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, first started to attract attention as a free prototype on itch.io back in 2016. Redbeet steadily expanded on that version&#x27;s core survival loop - in which players start out on a tiny wooden raft in the middle of the ocean, hooking up foods, supplies, and building materials until their tiny vessel is a veritable sea-faring palace - in preparation for a commercial early access release on Steam, which finally arrived in 2018.


Since then, Redbeet has continued to build on that early feature set, introducing the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign in which players can learn more about the flooded world.

                              <span>Planet Zoo&#x27;s steady stream of post-launch DLC continues today with the arrival of its 11th paid expansion, the eco-themed Conservation Pack, on Steam, introducing a selection of new, endangered animals, new scenery items, and more.


On the animal front, Planet Zoo&#x27;s Conservation Pack brings five new additions - Przewalski&#x27;s horse, amur leopard, scimitar-horned oryx, siamang, and axolotl - all of which are considered at-risk species as a result of climate change, poaching, and habitat degradation.


Elsewhere, the DLC introduces a new scenario challenging players to assist the Turtlerock Wildlife Orphanage, inspired by Mongolia&#x27;s Gorkhi Terelj National Park, by rescuing, raising, documenting and releasing as many species as possible. Renewable energy, plant diversity, and sustainability will be an important focus too.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eyeing up Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands but have been disinclined to purchase it during its Epic Games Store exclusivity period, you might like to know it&#x27;s making the leap to Steam this Thursday, 23rd June.


Released on Epic, PlayStation, and Xbox in March, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands takes the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2&#x27;s much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep and spins it out into a full-sized game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


The game-within-a-game premise casts players as an unnamed &quot;newbie&quot; in the real, Borderlands world who&#x27;s taking part in a D&amp;D-like game called Bunkers and Badasses. Several celebrity-voiced friends are along for the ride, as is the irrepressible Tina, as Dungeon Master.

Amazon UK does have the Carbon Black controller in stock at the time of writing, but third-party prices for a new (not used) controller start at £93.99 (official price is £54.99).

                              <span>The rights to Steam hit Spintires - as well as the fate of millions of dollars in revenue for spin-off sequels Mudrunner and Snowrunner - are the focus of several major legal claims between Saber Interactive and the game&#x27;s original publisher Oovee, Eurogamer can reveal. 


The increasingly bitter fight between the two companies escalated significantly last week with the issuing of a press release by a legal firm associated with Oovee containing numerous claims directed at Saber, and the brief return of Spintires to Steam despite its previous delisting in the wake of another legal challenge. 


Saber has subsequently filed a defamation claim in relation to Oovee&#x27;s allegations, Eurogamer can also reveal, while Spintires&#x27; Steam page is now back offline pending various DMCA challenges.

A tweet from the Nintendo Japan account states that the iOS version of the app will be updated in &quot;summer 2022&quot; and will only be compatible with iOS version 14.0 or later.


It therefore won&#x27;t be available on iOS version 13.0 or earlier, according to a rough translation of the tweet.

                              <span>EA&#x27;s Battlefield 2042 has attracted its fair share of controversy since it launched last November, with players unhappy with the omission of key features at launch as well as some questionable design decisions which resulted in fan backlash. 


There have been updates since release that have corrected the course of Battlefield 2042, with the belated launch of its first season earlier this month introducing a new map and features that have gone down well with the game&#x27;s community. 


Despite these updates, however, Battlefield 2042 still has players fighting under a Russian flag as one of the two factions in the game - a decision that sits uncomfortably given the invasion of Ukraine from Russian forces, and in light of EA&#x27;s decision to remove Russian clubs and the Russian national football team from FIFA 22, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online.

On the tiniest LCD screen I&#x27;ve ever seen, here&#x27;s Doom running inside a single Lego brick.


Brilliantly, this brick is a Lego element typically used as a computer screen, with the insides hollowed out to insert a miniature circuit and LCD display.

The choice of Hollywood hunk Pratt - star of Marvel, Jurassic World - as Mario raised eyebrows among many fans when it was first announced. 


Now, Chris Meledandri, boss of Mario and Minions animation studio Illumination, has responded.

                              <span>Sony is reportedly discontinuing PS Plus retail cards from stores ahead of the launch of its revamped subscription service.


The cards have been available to top up PS Plus membership for one, three, or 12 months, but as spotted by Polish site XGP they&#x27;re no longer available.



The move coincides with the launch of Sony&#x27;s new subscription service this week, which has multiple price tiers - making the old retail cards somewhat obsolete.

                              <span>Many were left disappointed when a new Silent Hill game was not announced during the not-E3-but-sort-of showcases over the last few weeks. However, for those that are keen for more thrills (and bloody spills) in its horror-filled world, fear not, as fans have your backs. 
A remake of the original Silent Hill is currently being made in Unreal Engine 5 by a group called Codeless Games (via DSO Gaming). And not only is it in development, but we have also been given a peak at 10 minutes of gameplay that focuses on Midwich Elementary School (a major building that protagonist Harry Mason explores in a bid to find his missing daughter). 
This project does a pretty good job at setting the scene and overall atmosphere.

Reducing the power to tech monopolies would do more to “fix” the Internet than any other single action, and I am generally in favor of them both. (The Center for American Progress wrote a good summary and evaluation of them. I have written in support of the bill that would force Google and Apple to give up their monopolies on their phone app stores.)...</span>

                              <span>PlayStation 5 may be a lot of things to a lot of different people, but one thing most would probably agree on is that it&#x27;s a bloody big console. Now, however, one enterprising YouTuber has taken up the challenge of downsizing the machine to create the &quot;world&#x27;s first PS5 Slim console&quot; - one that&#x27;s less than 2cm thick.


The project is the work of YouTube channel DIY Perks, which specialises in videos about designing and building gadgets and technology at home, and begins with a tear-down of Sony&#x27;s behemoth console to figure exactly which of its innards should stay and wish can go to hit that 2cm target.


Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the PS5&#x27;s bulk comes from its steel shrouding and CPU-cooling heatsink, and with those gone, DIY Perk&#x27;s target seems a little closer to reality. Ultimately, to hit that magic number, PS5&#x27;s existing cooling solution is replaced with a custom water-channeling system made from copper sheeting. It&#x27;s not a cheap option, costing an eyewatering $240 for the sheeting alone, but it appears to do the job.

                              <span>As the launch of its first major expansion approaches, Outriders - developer People Can Fly&#x27;s enjoyable third-person sci-fi shooter - is free to try on Steam this week, giving new players an opportunity to see what they&#x27;re missing.


Outriders launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation last April, delivering a slice of co-operative shooter action that Eurogamer reviewer Vikki Blake enjoyed, albeit with some caveats. &quot;For some,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I suspect Outriders doesn&#x27;t innovate enough to stand out from an already oversaturated shooter market, relying too much on the ideas of other, stronger titles that have come before it.&quot;


&quot;[But] as a die-hard Guardian and card-carrying fangirl of the genre,&quot; Vikki continued, &quot;Outriders tickles me in all the right places. Offering gunplay that feels solid and satisfying and an array of additional powers and abilities to keep combat fresh and exciting, I can only admit that Outriders has surprised me in all the right ways. Maybe it&#x27;ll surprise you, too.&quot;

                              <span>Northgard developer Shiro Games&#x27;  sci-fi strategy game Dune: Spice Wars now includes multiplayer support following the launch of its its first major early access update.


Dune: Spice Wars was well-received when it launched into Steam early access back in April, but several key features were missing from that initial release, including all-important multiplayer support. Shiro eventually confirmed multiplayer would arrive this &quot;summer&quot; as part of its inaugural development roadmap, and that day is finally here.


According to today&#x27;s patch notes, Dune&#x27;s multiplayer can utilise both dedicated servers and peer-to-peer connections, and enables players to try their hand at 2v2 matches or test their mettle in four-person free-for-alls, playing as Atreides, Harkonnen, Fremen, or Smugglers.

                              <span>Following its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC debut last month, Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play 3v3 skater Roller Champions has been given a Switch release date, and will, according to a new UK eShop listing, arrive on Nintendo&#x27;s platform tomorrow, 21st June.


Roller Champions is Ubisoft&#x27;s stab at creating its own chaotic sports mash-up in the vein of Rocket League, albeit one that switches out the latter&#x27;s cars-meet-football concept for a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football.


The gist is that two teams of three players hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another. When one team finally has the ball, they need to complete at least one lap before pelting it into the goal, with additional points accrued the more laps they can keep hold of it before taking a successful shot.

Streamer Rudeism, known for his weird and wonderful controllers and challenge run streams, has created a motion controller for Sifu as his latest project and streamed the results over the weekend.




How does it work? He wears two gloves that have motion sensors and a stick in each hand for movement. Simply punching the air is enough for light attacks, with other motions used for heavy attacks and parries, and then picking up items and other interactions are done by clicking in the sticks.

Reddit user Magister Organi, a Latin student, has been diligently researching the lyrics used in the game&#x27;s soundtrack and has confirmed the lyrics are in fact gibberish, despite many fans seeking hidden meanings.



Instead, the lyrics are computer generated and adjusted to sound like an ancient language.

                              <span>Mario Odyssey is now playable with up to 10 players in online multiplayer thanks to a new mod.


It&#x27;s been developed by CraftyBoss and is only playable on a modded Switch console using an unofficial ROM of the game.


&quot;Have fun exploring kingdoms with friends, playing game modes, or beating the game as fast as possible!&quot; reads a description of the mod. &quot;This mod is still early in development, so expect bugs and un-refined aspects as we work hard to improve it and make the mod as polished as possible.&quot;

The settlement means cheat company Elite Boss Tech and its various associates have accepted Bungie&#x27;s claim its cheat software violated Destiny 2&#x27;s user agreement. In return, Bungie has dropped other claims of its own TorrentFreak reported.


The $13.5m damages was calculated from the number of times Elite Boss Tech&#x27;s software was downloaded - 6765. Each instance incurred its own individual $2k penalty.

The news follows the recent Dragon&#x27;s Dogma livestream, in which Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 development was confirmed.



Since then, the game has hit a new peak of 6582 concurrent players according to SteamDB. That&#x27;s the highest number of concurrent players since hitting 27,368 when it was released six years ago.

                              <span>Alice: Madness Returns has once again disappeared from Steam.

Alice&#x27;s disappearance will be particularly frustrating for some, as the 2011 game only returned to Steam in February 2022 after a DRM issue saw it removed from sale for almost five years. Now, just a few months later, it&#x27;s gone again.

The reason for its sudden and unexpected disappearance? It&#x27;s not entirely clear. Steam&#x27;s not giving away much; Alice: Madness Returns&#x27; Steam page simply says &quot;at the request of the publisher, Alice: Madness Returns is no longer available for sale on Steam&quot;, which is a blanket statement that covers pretty much anything and everything.

                              <span>Tactical FPS Ready or Not is back on sale on Steam today after resolving a trademark dispute.

Yesterday, developer Void Interactive tweeted that it was dealing with a &quot;suggested trademark infringement&quot; of its &quot;recent Night Club map&quot; which rolled out as part of the early access game&#x27;s most recent update earlier in the week.

&quot;We take IP concerns very seriously, and in a show of good faith, we have decided to remove the subject materials and any reference to them from Ready or Not and from any of our social media or other publications,&quot; Void said (thanks, NME).

As recapped on the Lego blog as Lego Con 2022 came to a close, &quot;two Lego Super Mario designers, Alice and Didier, raced against a 90-second clock to find the eight brand-new Lego Super Mario characters from the Series 5 Character Packs.

After searching through piles of Lego bricks, the pair eventually revealed a Red Yoshi, Purple Toad, Blue Shy Guy, Waddlewing and more. We also spotted Nabbit, Hammer Bro, Toady, and Baby Yoshi, too.

The project - which explores the history of Microsoft&#x27;s console, from its conception to recent successes - began three years ago and was announced at the Xbox Anniversary Celebration.

                              <span>We already knew that Lego Brawls - a minifigure fighting game previously launched on Apple Arcade - was set to relaunch this summer on consoles and now we have a release date: 2nd September, 2022.

Published by Bandai Namco, the fighter will arrive on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S where the Smash Bros-like brawl will let &quot;Minifigure mayhem begin&quot;. Here&#x27;s a new teaser to celebrate:

As Tom explained at the time the ports were announced, the idea here is to battle - solo or with up to eight network players - and collect minifigures which you can then customise to create your own hero of choice. You can then take said hero and attempt to tackle the game&#x27;s global leaderboards.

As spotted by PCGN, a number of new items introduced along with the Werewolf expansion have descriptions that players of Square Enix&#x27;s hugely-popular MMORPG may find familiar. 

There&#x27;s the Racked Teak-a Greatshelves - a fantastic, if not particularly subtle, nod to Shadowbringers&#x27; Rak&#x27;tika Greatwood where the Viera live - as well as a reference to the game&#x27;s theme track.

                              <span>Despite its controversial launch, Diablo Immortal - Blizzard&#x27;s pocket-sized Diablo experience - has generated almost £20 million ($24m) since it launched earlier this month.

According to the analysts at Appmagic (thanks, Pocket Gamer), that makes Diablo Immortal - which has been downloaded over eight million times in just a fortnight - one of Blizzard&#x27;s biggest mobile app, second only to the immense popularity of Hearthstone. 

The game has seen its biggest success in the US, which accounts for 26 per cent of all downloads. This is followed by South Korea, Brazil, and Japan, with 11 per cent, 8 per cent, and 8 per cent of the market share respectively. The UK only features in the 17 per cent &quot;other&quot; category which aggregates low-level figures across the rest of the world.

                              <span>We’ve always known that phones—and the people carrying them—can be uniquely identified from their Bluetooth signatures, and that we need security techniques to prevent that. This new research shows that that’s not enough.
Computer scientists at the University of California San Diego proved in a study published May 24 that minute imperfections in phones caused during manufacturing create a unique Bluetooth beacon, one that establishes a digital signature or fingerprint distinct from any other device. Though phones’ Bluetooth uses cryptographic technology that limits trackability, using a radio receiver, these distortions in the Bluetooth signal can be discerned to track individual devices...</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, developer Supermassive released its sumputous slasher horror The Quarry on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in collaboration with publisher 2K Games - but a new report has claimed the game was originally in development as a &quot;signature&quot; title for Stadia, before Google made the decision to downsize its gaming operation and send the project elsewhere.


Stadia, of course, launched to much fanfare in 2019, and part of Google&#x27;s promise to early adopters was that the service would bring its own console-like exclusives from both first- and third-parties. To that end, Google established its own internal game development studio and signed deals with external developers, including Supermassive, as announced in 2020.


Those plans, however, changed dramatically just 14 months after Stadia&#x27;s high-profile arrival, with Google announcing a major rethink of its cloud streaming strategy following a less-than-stellar launch, which included the cancellation of all internal game development as it began prioritising selling its tech to third-parties.

                              <span>As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty&#x27;s server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, known as Ricochet, has unveiled a new mitigation technique that takes a player&#x27;s weapons (and fists) away when the system identifies them as a cheater.


Word of this latest mitigation technique comes via a new blog update detailing the current state of Call of Duty&#x27;s anti-cheat solution, and follows previously revealed anti-cheat techniques Cloaking and Damage Shield.


Damage Shield, Richochet&#x27;s first major mitigation technique, essentially works by turning on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater is detected in-match. Cloaking, meanwhile, makes it impossible for detected cheaters to see opponents and bullets, or even hear sounds.

Yet at the other end of the spectrum, indie games currently have an obsession with frogs and witches. 


But why? What is it about frogs and witches?

Announced at the Final Fantasy 7 25th anniversary celebration, the game is no longer exclusive to Epic on PC and even runs on the Steam Deck.


At full price it&#x27;s £70 - the same as on Epic (quietly increased since launch) and in line with other Square Enix new releases - however you can save 29 percent as a special launch promotion.

It&#x27;s a project that began back in April when Anna Ellsworth posted a YouTube video explaining the process of turning her harp into a controller.


Since then, she&#x27;s beaten the dreaded Dark Souls pair Ornstein and Smough and has now turned to Elden Ring, most recently defeating Margit the Fell Omen.

While 11 Bit is publishing and assisting with Project Vitriol, the game is actually the work of Polish developer Fool&#x27;s Theory - a &quot;collective of AAA veterans&quot; with previous credits on The Witcher 2 and 3. Its previous title, open-world RPG Seven: The Days Long Gone, released in 2017, and the studio has also lent support to the likes of Outriders and Divinity Original Sin 2.


As for Project Vitriol, 11 Bit Studios says the &quot;deep, morally ambiguous narrative-driven RPG&quot; is &quot;of a scale and scope not previously undertaken by the publisher&quot;, and Fool&#x27;s Theory CEO and project lead Jakub Rokosz had a little more to say as part of its announcement.

The roughly $20m pay cut was signalled last summer, when EA acknowledged &quot;stockholder feedback&quot; from a non-binding but decisive say-on-pay vote. 


In a nutshell, stockholders said EA&#x27;s execs were being handed pay awards from the company money pot that were too large and too frequent. In response, EA said it would make &quot;substantial changes&quot; to the pay of executives.

                              <span>Brilliant indie Unpacking has an Easter egg for developer Witchbeam&#x27;s next game, the studio has now revealed. 


The upcoming project, for now named &quot;TemPoPo&quot;, is still under-wraps. But &quot;a pixel art rendition of the key art... existings somewhere inside Unpacking&quot;, Witchbeam has said. 


The developer dropped the hint in a new blog update, and noted that no one had found the Easter egg so far. Still, the expectation is that now this information is out there, it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to discover. &quot;Let us know if you find it!&quot; Witchbeam concluded.

                              <span>A new fan made crossover sees The Last of Us&#x27; Joel and Ellie take on the snow-covered wilds of God of War. 
This crossover is thanks to the hard work of Speclizer, who used mods from OmegaFantasy to swap out Kratos and Atreus for Joel and Ellie respectively (it was also OmegaFantasy that enabled The Simpsons to tootle on over to God of War last month). This was done to &quot;celebrate two amazing games coming out this year&quot;.
And its not just Joel and Ellie that we get to see in action. The Last of Us&#x27; David also shows up as the mysterious &#x27;stranger&#x27; from the start of God of War, while the draugr have now become clickers.

                              <span>N64 classic Pokémon Snap will be added to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack library next week, on Friday 24th June. 


This is the game where you capture pictures of Pokémon, rather than capture the creatures themselves and force them to do your bidding. 


There have been plenty of weird and wonderful Pokémon spin-offs over the years, but Snap holds a firm place as one of the best. Via an on-rails safari through Pokémon environments, you get to see the little critters mucking about in their natural habitats.

Speaking to VGC, senior narrative designer Eevi Korhonen discussed the future of the studio and whether the story of Selene was finished.


&quot;Returnal was so ambitious,&quot; Korhonen said. &quot;We dreamt super big, but we still had to leave so much on the cutting room floor. All of these ideas and narrative systems. I&#x27;m super excited to pick up those pieces and see how those fit our new IP story.&quot;

The game&#x27;s early access version - a mix of base-building and crafting with multiplayer elements - has proven very popular, and positive reviews helped it hit 1m copies sold in just over a week. 


&quot;We at Stunlock are very proud of the amazing start V Rising has made since launching on Early Access,&quot;  Rickard Frisegård, boss of Swedish developer Stunklock said.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait but Capcom has finally announced it&#x27;s working on a sequel to cult-classic fantasy RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma.


Speculation has been rife regarding a follow-up to the well-regarded 2012 game for some time, only exacerbated by Capcom&#x27;s decision to host a tenth anniversary livestream for the not exactly blockbuster title.


It was in this retrospective livestream that Capcom&#x27;s long-awaited announcement was finally made, with series director Hideaki Itsuno revealing that Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is currently in development by whipping off his jacket to reveal a t-shirt emblazoned with the sequel&#x27;s logo.

The feature, which should be particularly useful to Game Pass subscribers reckoning with the service&#x27;s sizeable library of titles, is being referred to as the Game Performance Fit Indicator.


Essentially, each time you look at a game via the Xbox App, you&#x27;ll see a short message offering a prediction of how well Microsoft expects it to run on your machine, generated by comparing a title&#x27;s performance on PCs with similar specs to yours.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced this year&#x27;s ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest event, which promises to deliver over 30 playable pre-release Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S demos starting next week.


Things kick off next Tuesday, 21st June and the event&#x27;s demos will remain available to play for seven days, with proceedings coming to a close the following Monday, 27th June.


&quot;These &#x27;game demos&#x27; are not the norm,&quot; Microsoft notes in its announcement post. &quot;Typically, the demos you see in our Demo channel are created after the game is completed (or nearly completed) and represents an almost final to final version. Think of these as akin to &#x27;show floor demos&#x27; and not necessarily indicative of the final product.&quot;

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has confirmed Overwatch 2, which will be an &quot;always on, always evolving&quot; free-to-play game when it launches into early access on 4th October, will be ditching its predecessor&#x27;s lootboxes in favour of a seasonal battle pass and in-game store.


That news was shared during an extended Overwatch 2 livestream this evening, primarily focused on the game&#x27;s live-service model and seasonal content plan - the latter of which, according to Overwatch 2&#x27;s game director Aaron Keller, will enable Blizzard to deliver new content to players on a more &quot;frequent and consistent&quot; basis compared to the original game.


Each season will last nine weeks and alternately add a new hero then a new map. That&#x27;s a little different for season 1, however, with Blizzard promising three new heroes, six new maps, the new Push game mode, weekly challenges, 30+ new skins, and a new mythic skin when things get underway on 4th October in tandem with Overwatch 2&#x27;s early access launch.

                              <span>A new report by Activision Blizzard has claimed there is &quot;no widespread harassment, or systemic harassment&quot; at the company.


In response to multiple lawsuits against the company, Activision Blizzard conducted its own investigation and has published the findings.


&quot;Contrary to many of the allegations, the Board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that Activision Blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported,&quot; reads the report.

                              <span>Those clever people at Star Wars know how to get their fan community talking. In this case, we have a little nod to Star Wars: The Force Unleashed tucked away in the latest episode of Disney+&#x27;s Obi Wan Kenobi.
There will be spoilers for Obi-Wan Kenobi below. Read at your own discretion.
So, I will get straight to it. In short, the latest showing of Obi-Wan Kenobi sees everyone&#x27;s favourite Sith Lord pulling a stunt first made famous by The Force Unleashed&#x27;s Starkiller.

Mass Effect Legendary Edition contains the entire Mass Effect trilogy fully remastered with visual enhancements, technical improvements, and gameplay adjustments.


&quot;The upgrades are vast and far-reaching in the remaster. Shadow quality is boosted, geometry tweaked, and we have improved anti-aliasing to support the 4K picture on Series X, S and PS5,&quot; wrote Thomas Morgan in Digital Foundry&#x27;s analysis of the collection.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we&#x27;re ready to round off this two-week not-E3 announcement bonanza with a chat about Starfield, and a look to the future.

Starfield dominated Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s E3 event and was arguably the biggest game on show over the fortnight, though praise was hardly unanimous. It looked like a Bethesda RPG, many said, somehow not expecting exactly just that. Between the news you can&#x27;t fly to space and won&#x27;t have a voice, was it really as disappointing as some have made out?


Finally, with this main glut of not-E3 conferences done and dusted, talk turns to next year - when 2023 will see the return of both E3 and Summer Game Fest as in-person events. What will that look like, and will things be less messy in twelve months? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

                              <span>The Switch is certainly doing the numbers for Nintendo. In fact, it has now surpassed the sales figures of the 3DS in Japan, and as a result has become the third best selling console of all time in the country. 
These new stats come from industry insider Daniel Ahmad, who noted that Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console was now &quot;on track to reach the highs of the Game Boy (32.4m) and DS (32.9m)&quot;.
News of the Switch selling 25m units in Japan comes from Famitsu.

                              <span>Call of Duty Warzone is getting a brand-new map as part of Vanguard/Warzone&#x27;s Season Four update.

The map, titled &quot;Fortune’s Keep&quot;, features several key locations including Keep, a towering structure which houses 20 cannons, 10 staircases, 12 rooms and a fountain, and Smuggler&#x27;s Cove, another area with a focus on verticality, which includes eight ladders, three ziplines, eight huts and 11 boats.

Given the approximate size of Fortune&#x27;s Keep, one could speculate that this new map could replace Rebirth Island, the secondary map first introduced to Warzone with the release of Black Ops: Cold War.

The content in question was found by Koopavocelot (via kart_tour), and reveals new battle courses with sound files for GCN Cookie Land, DS Twilight House, Tour Paris Promenade, New York Minute and GBA Battle Course 1.
This, of course, may not mean a Battle Mode is coming to Mario Kart Tour, but its an interesting thought.

                              <span>Another day, another case of Nintendo being Nintendo. This time, the company is cracking down on a YouTuber that uploaded covers of music from Metroid Prime to their channel.
Content creator SynaMax revealed that nine of his videos have had to be taken down, after Nintendo sent in the big guns and flexed their legal muscles his way.
&quot;On 31st May, a lawyer representing Nintendo called me and asked me to take down nine videos off the channel,&quot; SynaMax explained in a new video (spotted by VGC). &quot;I&#x27;m really disappointed in Nintendo that they would force me to take down these videos because they want compulsory licenses.&quot;

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto has explained what the game&#x27;s &quot;Open Zone&quot; structure really means.


Speaking to IGN, Kishimoto&#x27;s comments somewhat clarify what separates Sonic Frontiers from open-world games.


&quot;Level-based platformers often have a world map. Our Open Zone is a world map, only we&#x27;ve made it entirely playable,&quot; said Kishimoto.

                              <span>If you are looking to get your hands on Arkane&#x27;s upcoming vampire riddled RPG to play with your nearest and dearest, here is a quick heads up: you will only be able to save any progress you make in Redfall&#x27;s campaign if you are the host.
Speaking to IGN, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith revealed, &quot;whoever hosts the session, or whoever initiates the session... their progress is persistent for them. But [for] other people, it&#x27;s not. In terms of what missions you&#x27;ve unlocked and such, the host, their progression matters.&quot;
He went on to explain, &quot;if you sign on with a friend and they&#x27;re halfway through the game, and you play the second half of the game with them and then you need to go back and you want to play on your own, you&#x27;ll be starting at the beginning of the campaign with a character&quot;.

                              <span>Capcom has reactivated the previous versions of Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 on PC, following player feedback.


After the Capcom showcase, the publisher released a free upgrade across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, adding in ray-tracing, 4K support, and 3D audio.


However, on PC the new version had increased minimum system requirements and was unable to revert back to the previous version, locking some players out of the game. This has now been reactivated.

The offending item was an emblem which included a palette option called &quot;Bonobo&quot;, which is the name of an endangered great ape.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Sponge Examples: Energy-Latency Attacks on Neural Networks“:
Abstract: The high energy costs of neural network training and inference led to the use of acceleration hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. While such devices enable us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, their designers’ focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully-crafted sponge examples, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency, to drive machine learning (ML) systems towards their worst-case performance. Sponge examples are, to our knowledge, the first denial-of-service attack against the ML components of such systems. We mount two variants of our sponge attack on a wide range of state-of-the-art neural network models, and find that language models are surprisingly vulnerable. Sponge examples frequently increase both latency and energy consumption of these models by a factor of 30×. Extensive experiments show that our new attack is effective across different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and an ASIC simulator) on a wide range of different language tasks. On vision tasks, we show that sponge examples can be produced and a latency degradation observed, but the effect is less pronounced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge examples in the real world, we mount an attack against Microsoft Azure’s translator and show an increase of response time from 1ms to 6s (6000×). We conclude by proposing a defense strategy: shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective...</span>

                              <span>EA has announced FIFA 22 will be joining its EA Play subscription service, as well as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, next Thursday, 23rd June.


FIFA 22, if you haven&#x27;t been keeping track, brought some solid improvements to the long-running football series when it launched last year, but its wins were, once again, overshadowed by what Eurogamer&#x27;s Wesley Yin-Poole called its &quot;morally bankrupt monetisation&quot; in his review.


&quot;I play a lot of FIFA, and with good reason,&quot; Wes wrote. &quot;I enjoy it, in a grumpy sort of way. Reporting on all the good, bad and ugly FIFA has to offer has been a fascinating part of my job over the last decade. If you&#x27;re only in it for Career Mode, for example, FIFA 22 is a good shout. If you only play Volta (there must be someone!) then there&#x27;s nothing particularly offensive about the game. But context is king. Ultimate Team cannot be ignored.&quot;

                              <span>A new report has claimed Sony is working on a &quot;pro&quot; controller for PlayStation 5 that it&#x27;s planning to officially unveil &quot;soon&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to the ever leaky Tom Henderson who, writing for Try Hard Guides (thanks VGC), claims to have seen images of a prototype from a source wishing to remain anonymous.


Henderson says the new controller retains the same basic style of the existing PlayStation 5 controller but features a number of key differences. These include &quot;removable stick units&quot; - which can be switched in and out using buttons below the analog sticks - plus trigger stops, a seemingly removal grip, and rear buttons that Henderson describes as &quot;flappy paddles&quot;, presumably similar to those seen on the likes of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.

                              <span>Following its long-awaited official unveiling last week, Naughty Dog has given another glimpse of its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for PS5 and PC, this time showcasing what it calls a &quot;glow up&quot; for supporting character Tess.


During last week&#x27;s Summer Game Fest reveal, one of key arguments Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann made for remaking the original Last of Us - a game that already got the remaster treatment in 2014 - was that the additional power of modern hardware would enable it to get closer to its &quot;original vision&quot;. The studio specifically highlighted the remake&#x27;s rebuilt character models and faces, which it said would better reflect the cast&#x27;s original performances.


Inevitably, the remake&#x27;s character changes have come as something of a shock to fans who&#x27;ve grown attached to the original versions over the last nine years, with both Joel and Ellie now sporting more realistic facial makeovers that age them notably. That&#x27;s especially true for Naughty Dog&#x27;s latest reveal, showcasing the new version of Joel&#x27;s friend Tess, who initially agrees to help smuggle Ellie out of the city.

                              <span>Wo Long development producer Masaaki Yamagiwa has commented on the difficulty level of Team Ninja&#x27;s new Soulslike, revealed at the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase.


Yamagiwa previously worked at Sony&#x27;s Japan Studio when it published Bloodborne, so understands the importance of balanced difficulty.


&quot;Difficult games shouldn&#x27;t be difficult just for the sake of it,&quot; Yamagiwa told IGN. &quot;I think it&#x27;s really important that this difficulty exists for the purpose of delivering a sense of accomplishment to the players once they have overcome it. That&#x27;s why I think players should always be able to blame themselves when they die. The game has to be fair and its difficulty should never be unreasonable. In that regard, it works in my favour that I&#x27;m not very good at games myself. I&#x27;ll always naturally be judging the fairness of games.&quot;

                              <span>PIXOMONDO, the VFX team behind the special effects for the first season of Paramount&#x27;s Halo TV adaptation, has released a new reel showing off its work behind the scenes.
Included in this reel are clips of Jen Taylor mocapping her character of Cortana, as well as the evolution of the series&#x27; many digital environments. Taylor has famously voiced the role of Cortana throughout the Halo games, making her inclusion in the show a pretty special one for fans.
It is an interesting watch and, for those in the UK, one of our best looks at the show yet. You can check it out for yourself below.

Now Sekiro Dubi has discovered a potential cut questline for Festering Fingerprint Vyke.

                              <span>We all know Elden Ring is a tricky game and its optional boss battle against Malenia is arguably the most difficult moment of the game.


But one streamer, Kwitty23, decided to beat the whole game playing as Malenia. Not only that, he only used one move the entire run: her iconic Waterfowl Dance.


Funniest of all was when Kwitty23 ended up fighting Malenia as Malenia and proceeded to destroy her first time. Turns out she&#x27;s pretty weak to her own attacks.

Senior concept artist Gervasio Canda has shared dozens of artworks over the past few years, which have garnered attention this week after fans began discussing one piece of art in particular. 


The following artwork is the only one in Canda&#x27;s collection to depict a landscape that has not (to date) appeared in Fortnite. Are we looking into the future of the game? Or, perhaps more likely, is this an area Epic Games ended up not using?

This adaptation, which is set to release on 11th August 2023, will focus on the story of one teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills won them a series of Nissan competitions to become a professional race car driver. Deadline reports the screenplay has been written by Jason Hall.
If this all sounds familiar to you and you are getting a strong sense of déjà vu, well, you&#x27;re right to feel that way. After all, this is the same concept from the Gran Turismo film that never was.

At the time of this announcement, Capcom revealed those yet to experience the games will be able to purchase the newly updated Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions from their respective stores, but existing owners on Xbox One and PS4 would be able to grab the updates relevant to their platform at no additional cost.
However, it now transpires this is not the case for those who got their hands on Resident Evil 7 through the PlayStation Plus Collection (something that is exclusive to the PS5).
Instead, those who have been playing the game via the PS Plus Collection but also want to experience the game with its 4K resolution, &quot;high&quot; framerates, ray tracing, and 3D audio will need to purchase the game separately (via IGN).

The Convergence Team - a group of three modders - created a celebrated mod for Dark Souls 3 that significantly altered the main game. It added new character classes, over 100 new spells, new rings, armours and weapons, new factions, and even new NPCs and bosses.


It looks like Elden Ring will be getting the same treatment.

That&#x27;s according to Yoshimi Yasuda, the game&#x27;s executive producer, who recently formed a fresh company to work on projects unknown. 


Does this mean a re-release, a remaster or a sequel to the original Lollipop Chainsaw, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this week? Yasuda declined to mention.

                              <span>Kid Kirby, originally planned for the SNES, is a cancelled Nintendo game we&#x27;ve previously known little of. Now, fresh details have come to light showing a little more of what could have been, had this project come to fruition. 
Details shared by the Kid Kirby Archive Twitter include manual pages, a story overview and new renders, all of which were provided by writer Steve Hammond.
First off, we have a render of King Dedede, a character only previously seen in much lower quality on a 1995 internal brochure.

                              <span>GSC Game World has provided a fresh update on its staff and the development of its upcoming project Stalker 2, amidst the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 


The video, below, is a tough and often extraordinary watch - but one which details how life has changed for the game&#x27;s team over the course of this year.


Many GSC staff have now fled Ukraine, though others have been unable to. Here, those still in the country show their current living conditions, describe the destruction around them, and in some cases speak from the war&#x27;s frontlines - where they have gone to fight for their country.

Within this documentary, viewers will &quot;learn how a young and inexperienced team at UK development studio Rare were handed the James Bond licence, before making a game that would change the medium forever when it was released&quot;. 
This includes insights from the original GoldenEye 007 team, as well as those within the press that covered the game on its release (all the way back in 1997!) and saw their careers change as a result. It will also touch base with the many fans who played the game 25 years ago and discuss the resulting impact it had on them.

At the time, the developer said this delay was to ensure it delivers &quot;the best possible experience&quot; to players on its eventual launch. However, it has now been revealed that, as with other games, this delay was also due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
&quot;We had a bit of a weird thing with the multiplayer because... part of our team is based out in the Ukraine... So, we had to delay the multiplayer because they had to move,&quot; The Quarry creative director Will Byles told IGN.
&quot;We had to move the server from Kyiv up into Warsaw and those guys had to get out [of] there because it was obviously really dangerous.&quot;

The project, an all-new Fire Emblem RPG in the works for Nintendo Switch, was discussed yesterday by Nintendo leaker Emily Rogers. Shortly after, screenshots purportedly showing an early version of the game were posted on reddit. 

Eurogamer understands the project is real. We&#x27;ve contacted Nintendo for more.

Todd Howard, the game&#x27;s director, spoke to IGN and offered further details on the game - including the length of its main quest. 



However, when asked whether players can fly seamlessly to space, Howard said the feature is &quot;really just not that important to the player&quot; to justify the extra engineering work required.

                              <span>This is a new vulnerability against Apple’s M1 chip. Researchers say that it is unpatchable.
Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, however, have created a novel hardware attack, which combines memory corruption and speculative execution attacks to sidestep the security feature. The attack shows that pointer authentication can be defeated without leaving a trace, and as it utilizes a hardware mechanism, no software patch can fix it.
The attack, appropriately called “Pacman,” works by “guessing” a pointer authentication code (PAC), a cryptographic signature that confirms that an app hasn’t been maliciously altered. This is done using speculative execution—a technique used by modern computer processors to speed up performance by speculatively guessing various lines of computation—to leak PAC verification results, while a hardware side-channel reveals whether or not the guess was correct...</span>

                              <span>A new report by UK consumer watchdog Which? has claimed two in five Joy-Con controllers from the original version of the Switch are affected by persistent drift.


Switch has faced widespread complaints around Joy-Con controller drift since its launch in 2017, leading to class action lawsuits, and even EU calls for an investigation into the issue after it received more than 25,000 complaints from numerous countries. Reports were significant enough that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologised for the issue in 2020, which it&#x27;s since claimed to have &quot;improved&quot;.


More recently, a Kotaku report claimed Nintendo of America recieved &quot;thousands&quot; of faulty Joy-Cons each week at height of drift issues, and now UK consumer watchdog Which? has shared its own findings into the severity of the problem, claiming two in five (40 percent) of Joy-Con controllers from the original Switch are affected.

                              <span>When last we heard of Fallout 5, it was little more than a &quot;one-pager&quot; idea at Bethesda that may or may not come to fruition; however, studio director Todd Howard has now confirmed a new mainline entry in the beloved Fallout series is definitely happening, but won&#x27;t release until after The Elder Scrolls 6.


In conversation with IGN, Howard revealed The Elder Scrolls 6 is currently in pre-production (confirming previous rumours around the project&#x27;s progress), before adding, &quot;And, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate&#x27;s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.&quot;


In other words, with Bethesda&#x27;s next big title, sci-fi RPG Starfield, delayed until next year, and still no word on a potential release window for The Elder Scrolls 6 - despite the game having received its first official tease back in 2018 - it sounds like there&#x27;ll be an extremely long wait until Fallout 5 finally sees the light of day.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard - which continues its attempts to reassert itself following many months of shocking allegations it fostered a company culture where sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has confirmed Overwatch 2&#x27;s second closed beta will launch for PC and consoles on 28th June.


Blizzard first announced its intention to &quot;decouple&quot; Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvP and PvE modes and begin a series of multiplayer-focused betas back in March, and the first of these took place in April. That initial run gave participants a first look at Overwatch 2&#x27;s 5v5 gameplay, Push mode, four new maps, new hero Sojourn, and reworkings of Orisa, Doomfist, Bastion, and Sombra.


Round two, announced earlier today on Twitter, will shake things up a little further, giving players access to new tank hero Junker Queen and a new map. Blizzard is saving further details for a livestream airing this Thursday, 16th June, at 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PT, and says it&#x27;ll be discussing the game&#x27;s live-service model and seasonal content plan at the same time.

Asobo first targeted the US for a bit of a visual makeover in its second-ever World Update back in November 2020, introducing a significant number of improvements to the United States&#x27; multitudinous geological and man-made landmarks.
At the time, it said that the sheer size of the US meant it would eventually be revisiting the area, and now, seven World Updates later, that day has come.

                              <span>Over the weekend, Microsoft shared a list of 50 new titles heading to Game Pass over the next 12 months, and it&#x27;s now given a little more detail on one of those games - developer Iron Gate Studio&#x27;s acclaimed viking survival hit Valheim - confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for PC Game Pass this autumn with an Xbox release next spring.


Valheim, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched into Steam early access last February, and its refined viking survival action - which sees players exploring a gorgeous open-world, slowly preparing themselves to battle powerful creatures and prove themselves worthy of entering Valhalla - immediately drew critical acclaim.


It was also a massive sales hit too, managing to sell a staggering 4m copies in only three weeks. One year on, it&#x27;s shifted over 10 million copies on PC, and development continues apace, with work on its highly anticipated Mistlands update said to be &quot;well underway&quot;.

                              <span>After 18 months and an enormous offering of things to climb, stab, see and do, the mighty Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will wrap-up its free additions at the end of this year. 


Fans can look forward to seeing &quot;the last episode of the story of Eivor&quot; via a final free chapter - which will presumably tell the story of how our Norse heroine came to rest in Vinland. 


Before then, there&#x27;s a new Niflheim-set roguelite game mode named The Forgotten Saga coming this summer, and a final set of challenge vaults coming this autumn to conclude the game&#x27;s Tombs of the Fallen mystery. And, of course, there&#x27;s the game&#x27;s seasonal festivals. All of this content comes for free.

                              <span>Nintendo hacker group boss Max Louarn has been interviewed on his company&#x27;s activities, following the 40-month prison sentence handed down to colleague Gary Bowser.


Bowser remains the only member of Louarn&#x27;s company Team Xecuter to be arrested, deported and now imprisoned in the US, for his part in the group&#x27;s sale of console mod devices that allowed people to play pirated games. Louarn, a French citizen, meanwhile lives in Avignon and was recently interviewed by Le Monde (paywall), via TorrentFreak.


&quot;I was&#x27;t going to end up as an engineer earning €5k a month when I realized, at 18, that hacking was not just fun, but that there was a way to make a lot of money,&quot; Louarn says, of how he got into the hacking game. &quot;Stealing from companies that make billions, what do I care?&quot;

                              <span>Tekken 2 was accidentally priced at almost $10k on the PSN store, catching the attention of Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada.


The PS1 classic fighter has been added to the store as part of the PS Plus subscription, but as Twitter user TheKBGamer spotted the game was incorrectly listed as costing $9999.


Harada shared the tweet joking &quot;what a marvellous price Sony&quot;. Presumably he would&#x27;ve Tekken quite the bonus at that price.

A trailer for the crossover - a spoof of the Halo 3 &quot;Believe&quot; campaign - confirms a release date of 30th June. That&#x27;s a week after the game finally hits Xbox as a free-to-play game.



The event will seemingly last until 4th July and be available across all platforms: Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch.

The event, dubbed a &quot;Celebration Livestream&quot;, is yet another livestream in this never-ending not-E3 several week period - during which Ubisoft itself has kept noticeably quiet.


But what should we really expect tonight? It&#x27;s perhaps worth keeping expectations in check.

Back in April, Square Enix trademarked the name in Japan sparking rumours of a remake.


This leak suggests the remake is real, although a PSN listing that&#x27;s since been removed (thanks Escapist) offers no gameplay or release date details.

                              <span>Capcom has amended its minimum requirements on PC for the newly upgraded Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7.



The free upgrades, released after the Capcom showcase, are across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and include ray-tracing, 4K support, higher framerates, and 3D audio.



However, the minimum requirements on PC have been raised and Capcom notes that &quot;once the upgrade patch has been applied, the game cannot be restored to the previous version even if the game is uninstalled.&quot;

                              <span>Capcom has played down reports that long-running Street Fighter character Fei Long can no longer appear in the famous fighting game franchise due to a clash with the Bruce Lee estate.


Fei Long, originally created for 1993&#x27;s Super Street Fighter 2 as one of four new challengers, is heavily-inspired by real-life movie martial arts legend Bruce Lee.


Last month, Street Fighter 5 composer Daniel Lindholm suggested Fei Long may no longer feature in the series because the Lee Bruce estate insists depictions of the Enter the Dragon star must be &quot;honourable&quot;, rather than humourous in the wake of the &quot;comedy&quot; cameo in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

                              <span>Interesting vulnerability in Tesla’s NFC key cards:
Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, quickly noticed something odd about the new feature: Not only did it allow the car to automatically start within 130 seconds of being unlocked with the NFC card, but it also put the car in a state to accept entirely new keys­with no authentication required and zero indication given by the in-car display.
“The authorization given in the 130-second interval is too general… [it’s] not only for drive,” Herfurt said in an online interview. “This timer has been introduced by Tesla… in order to make the use of the NFC card as a primary means of using the car more convenient. What should happen is that the car can be started and driven without the user having to use the key card a second time. The problem: within the 130-second period, not only the driving of the car is authorized, but also the [enrolling] of a new key.”...</span>

                              <span>We knew they were coming, but Capcom has announced its PS5 and Xbox Series X/S spruce-ups of Resident Evil 2, 3 and 7 will launch today, 13th June.


All three titles - which is to say, the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes, plus Resident Evil 7 - will feature support for 4K resolution, &quot;high&quot; framerates, ray tracing, and 3D audio.


Players yet to experience the games will be able to purchase the newly updated Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions from their respective stores, but existing owners on Xbox One and PS4 can grab the updates relevant to their platform at no additional cost. Saves will also transfer.

She&#x27;ll feature in the arcade-style The Mercenaries: Additional Orders mode, as well as Chris Redfield and Karl Heisenberg. Mind your head though - you&#x27;ll need to duck down through doorways as you slash enemies from nine feet above.


The Mercenaries mode is one of three major additions in this Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC, due out on 28th October this year.

                              <span>Ahead of its full launch at the end of the month, Capcom is giving players the chance to try out Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s massive Sunbreak expansion  via an expansive new demo, coming to Steam and Switch tomorrow, 14th June.


The new demo will give players the opportunity to explore Sunbreak&#x27;s newly revealed jungle locale, a twist on the area first encountered in 2006&#x27;s Monster Hunter 2, complete with new elements and endemic life. Here they can test their mettle against flying wyvern Astalos (from Monster Hunter Generations), a Great Izuchi, a Tetranadon, plus an especially challenging version of Sunbreak&#x27;s flagship monster Malzeno.


It&#x27;ll also let players try out Sunbreak&#x27;s new Switch Skill Swap system, new Silkbind attacks, and a variety of handy tutorials.

                              <span>Bethesda has slapped a new release window on Fallout 76&#x27;s previously announced The Pitt expansion, confirming the Fallout-3-inspired update will arrive some time this September.


Fallout 76&#x27;s The Pitt expansion was annouced for a 2022 release last June, and its arrival date was narrowed down a little further, specifically to this &quot;autumn&quot;, as part of February&#x27;s 2022 roadmap. Last night&#x27;s Xbox showcase, though, saw it inching even closer to receiving a proper release date, with its new gameplay trailer heralding a September launch.


The Pitt - inspired by the second add-on released for 2008&#x27;s much-loved Fallout 3 - will arrive as part of Fallout 76&#x27;s Season 10 update in September, and marks the first time players will be able to travel beyond the boundaries of Appalachia in the online game.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s big Starfield gameplay reveal, Bethesda has re-emerged with a few additional details regarding its highly anticipated sci-fi RPG, confirming that dialogue scenes will be presented in first-person throughout, and that the main character won&#x27;t be voiced.


If you&#x27;re only familiar with Bethesda games prior to Fallout 4, that probably won&#x27;t seem like all that big a deal, given that mute protagonists and lengthy first-person conversations with dead-eyed NPCs were par for the course in Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, and Oblivion.


It&#x27;s really only notable when you factor in Fallout 4; here, Bethesda opted for a slightly more cinematic approach to its story telling, switching to third-person perspective during dialogue scenes and introducing a fully voiced protagonist - the latter drawing complaints from fans that felt the decision had forced the developer to limit the breadth and depth of conversation options compared to those seen in previous games.

                              <span>Yesterday, Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4, the game that&#x27;s not Diablo Immoral (sorry, I meant Immortal), will launch for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S next year. Since this news came to light, some have been voicing concerns that Diablo 4 may go down the same route as Diablo Immortal and have some kind of mobile-like monetisation and microtransactions attached to it. 
In response, several of its developers have swiftly jumped in to try and quell any anxiety within the Diablo community.
&quot;To be clear, [Diablo 4] is a full price game built for PC/PS/Xbox audiences,&quot; franchise exec Rod Fergusson tweeted yesterday.

This includes dozens more games for the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium&#x27;s game catalogue of PS4 and PS5 titles, such as: Dead Cells, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Frostpunk: Console Edition, John Wick Hex, Little Nightmares, Nioh, Prey, Shenmue 3, Soulcalibur 6, Surgeon Simulator, Telling Lies, Tropico 5, Trine 4, plus The Dark Pictures Anthology&#x27;s Little Hope and Man of Medan. 


The list of games available in the US looks to be a large upgrade from the list of games available in Hong Kong, for example. But there are some games (Journey to the Savage Planet) listed as available in Asia but not in the US.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 was the highlight of last week&#x27;s not-E3, with playable booths at Summer Game Fest drawing the biggest crowds while the developers were on-hand to answer questions and outline specifics of the return of Capcom&#x27;s beloved series. Well, they&#x27;ve been answering some questions, while some other areas still remain bizarrely unclear. 


Crossplay has been a hope for the game since its reveal - something supported on Street Fighter 5 across PC and PlayStation, with Street Fighter 6 promising to bring Xbox players into the fold - and early reports from showgoers including fighting game YouTuber Maximillian Dood seemingly confirmed it would be included.


When pushed for clarity on the issue, however, Capcom was unwilling to confirm the matter. &quot;In terms of crossplay we&#x27;re going to have more information and more specifics to share down the line,&quot; a Capcom representative told Eurogamer at Summer Game Fest. &quot;It&#x27;s something we feel strongly about but in terms of actual specifics that will come at a later time.&quot;

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper, the acclaimed indie game from In Other Waters developer Jump Over the Age, is getting a bunch of free DLC episodes.


Three extra dollops of story will arrive &quot;throughout 2022 and into 2023&quot;, and build on the game&#x27;s existing lore with fresh characters and quests. 


The first of these, Flux, will drop in July and detail the arrival of a refugee flotilla to Erlin&#x27;s Eye. It&#x27;s a plotline that will continue in October with a second free DLC release, then conclude sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Kojima Productions has issued a statement to fans addressing its future with Sony, following yesterday&#x27;s confirmation that Hideo Kojima was now working on a project for Xbox.


Of course, Kojima most recently partnered with PlayStation for Death Stranding - and fans of that game are now expecting a Death Stranding sequel, thanks to the loose lips of actor and star Norman Reedus. 


Kojima&#x27;s partnership with Sony was a major coup for PlayStation, and was announced with glee by its then-head Andy House. Kojima&#x27;s appearance on last night&#x27;s Microsoft and Bethesda Showcase, introduced by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, held similar vibes.

This news did not come with an official statement or announcement. Rather, following Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s showcase last night, Xbox released a tweet detailing all its upcoming games for the next 12 months. 
As you can see below, this image shows Stalker 2 on the right-hand side, which denotes the games releasing in the first half of 2023.

The moral is, as it always is, that implementing cryptography securely is hard. Don’t roll your own anything if you can help it.</span>

                              <span>We may not have got the James Bond Goldeneye announcement that we were all expecting at Microsoft and Bethesda’s showcase earlier this evening, but we did get another look at something pretty damn close to it at the PC Gaming Show – Replicant D6’s Agent 64: Spies Never Die. And not only did we get to see some more of this glorious gameplay in motion, we also got the news that its demo is now available to download on Steam.
The full game is slated to release sometime this year, although at the time of writing no further specifics were given.
Agent 64: Spies Never Die is all very James Bond GoldenEye a la the Nintendo 64 era, from the music and the weapons to the settings. There is even footage of the shooter - I assume the titular Agent 64 - finishing someone off in a toilet stall. Small me is very happy to see this and will most likely be heading to Steam to download the demo once I have finished work for the evening. You can check out the new trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>Last May, developer Ion Lands got fans of its gorgeous Blade-Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk a little bit giddy with the announcement of new life-sim spin-off Nivalis, and now, a little over a year on, the developer has given a first look at the game in action.


Cloudpunk, which released back in 2020, was an experience I enjoyed a lot after it received a number of much-needed post-launch nips and tucks, revelling in the chance to play out all my Blade Runner fantasies by careening around its stunningly designed, neon-drenched futuristic city of Nivalis in my trusty flying car.


The biggest disappointment was that Nivalis proved to be rather lifeless at ground level, which is where Cloudpunk&#x27;s spin-off comes in, attempting to turn the city from a pretty backdrop into a rich, meaningful world of its own as you attempt to build a business up from scratch.

That date was revealed this evening during a fresh trailer for Immortality, shown during this year&#x27;s PC Gaming Show. As previously announced, the title will launch on Xbox directly into Game Pass.


Immortality is an investigative horror game where you sift through footage from three (fictional) classic films which starred the (also fictional) actress Marissa Marcel, in order to discover her fate.

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind the acclaimed likes of Frostpunk and This War of Mine, has unveiled its latest project, sci-fi survival adventure The Alters.


Unfortunately, it&#x27;s early days as far as specifics go, with the bulk of 11 Bit&#x27;s reveal taking the form of a cinematic trailer - one immediately bringing Duncan Jones&#x27; celebrated sci-fi movie Moon to mind. You see, in The Alters, players take on the role of Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant planet, ensconced in a roving wheel-like base, with a bunch of alternative versions of himself known as Alters. Ultimately, the goal is to stay alive long enough to find a way back home by creating new Alters, each of who have different skills essential for survival.


&quot;The Alters is a game about life-changing moments,&quot; explains The Alters&#x27; new Steam page. &quot;Those binary decisions that happen in nanoseconds, but have influence over your entire life. It is about looking into yourself, into your past, and discovering that you are who you are as a sum of those numerous choices. And when you do that a fundamental question arises: WHAT IF...?&quot;.

Set in the Later Han Dynasty - or a version of it where demons exist - you play as a nameless soldier skilled in Chinese martial arts. Here&#x27;s a first trailer - what do you think?

                              <span>It&#x27;s taken over four years of concerted pleading, but Sea of Thieves players will finally be able to name their own ships from July, when the multiplayer pirate adventures very-long-awaited Captaincy Update arrives as part of Season Seven.


First discussed prior to Sea of Thieves&#x27; launch, the Captaincy Update was originally set to be one of the game&#x27;s first post-launch updates, giving Pirate Legends the ability create their own legendary ship and forge a fearsome identity for themselves on the waves. They&#x27;d also start each session within the Legendary Hideout, blasting through its waterfall to make a grand entrance on the main map.


Unfortunately, following Sea of Thieves&#x27; rocky launch, Rare announced it would be placing the Captaincy update &quot;on the back burner&quot; while it refocussed its development. Since then, the Captaincy update has become the stuff of legends itself, many assuming it was lost to time.

                              <span>If you like mournfully hopping around a mysterious world as a little person solving puzzles, you might like the sound of Cocoon: it&#x27;s a deeply handsome puzzle-platforming indie from Jeppe Carlsen, the gameplay designer of Limbo and Inside.
You play as a kind of fly-person, who carries various glowing spheres around various exotic worlds. It&#x27;s wonderfully moody, the opening desert hinting at some Sable-like vibes before we move on to a range of other ones, &quot;worlds within worlds&quot; as the blurb puts it. Even from just the trailer you get the sense there&#x27;s some real cleverness to the puzzle-platforming to go with it.
Looks good! You can &quot;unravel a cosmic mystery&quot; in it next year, as it&#x27;s coming 2023, like an awful lot of games it seems, on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass.

                              <span>Starfield&#x27;s delay was some of the biggest news to come this year, but alas not a surprise. After all, we had only been shown concept art with every teaser so far. Thankfully though, we now have our first look at some actual gameplay.
The gameplay starts off on the mysterious moon of Kreet and sees robot companion VASCO making his way out of the starship. Then, of course, we see some aliens, other space things and some combat. All the while, the swelling score is ticking along nicely in the background. We also pop over to New Atlantis at one point.
But you&#x27;re not here to listen to me waffling on. You&#x27;re here to see it for yourself. So, without further ado, here is our first look at gameplay for Starfield.

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Showcase brought confirmation of Microsoft&#x27;s new partnership with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima. 


Details were thin on the ground - really, there was nothing here which had not been reported already - but tonight Microsoft made it official. 


Kojima is working on a brand new project with Xbox which will harness the company&#x27;s cloud technology. If this sounds familiar, well, it&#x27;s a promise we&#x27;ve heard before, and a detail which first found its way online last summer, when whispers of Kojima working with Microsoft first hit the internet.

                              <span>We didn&#x27;t see this one coming: renowned role-playing game developer Obsidian is releasing a brand new game called Pentiment this November on Xbox consoles, PC and the cloud.
It&#x27;s a narrative-focused murder mystery set in medieval times, and the action takes place on the pages of an era-appropriate book. It certainly looks different to everything else out there.
The game is led by Obsidian star director Josh Sawyer (Fallout: new Vegas, Pillars of Eternity) and is apparently an idea he pitched years and years ago at Black Isle Studios, according to IGN, which interviewed Sawyer about his new game.

Grounded has been available in early access for PC and Xbox since July 2020, miniaturising players - in true Honey, I Shrunk the Kids fashion - down to bug height and sending them off on an 80s-themed survival adventure through an ordinary backyard.


There&#x27;s building, crafting, spiders the size of trucks (at least from your miniaturised perspective), and a whole lot more to experience as you - along with a couple of friends if you like - fight to find a way to return to human size.

                              <span>Ara: History Untold was revealed during the Xbox and Bethesda Games showcase today, with scant detail beyond a cinematic trailer and a website.
It&#x27;s a turn-based grand strategy game, from Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games, and the angle seems to be: Civilization, but with an emphasis on alternate history.
Think snow-capped Pyramids, steampunk future-cities, and blimps, of course, because who doesn&#x27;t love a good blimp.

                              <span>Minecraft maker Mojang has revealed a new action strategy spin-off for its sandbox franchise: Minecraft Legends, developed with Blackbird Interactive. 


Described as an action strategy game, this 2023 release sees you run about slashing away at Minecraft enemies in a bid to unite Minecraft&#x27;s overworld, whatever that means. 


Still, it looks intriguing and if it&#x27;s half as fun as Mojang&#x27;s Minecraft Dungeons, will be worth a try. As you&#x27;d expect, it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and will launch for PC via Windows Store and Steam, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

                              <span>Microsoft showed a new trailer for A Plage Tale: Requiem during the Games Showcase today, giving us another rare look at gameplay in the upcoming sequel, due sometime this year on Xbox Consoles, PC and Game Pass at launch. It&#x27;s also coming to PS5 but obviously Microsoft glossed over that bit.
The thing that really stuck out to me, a fan of the first game, was stabbing. Amicia, the returning older sister of brother Hugo, and our hero, can now approach enemies from the back and stealth-kill them, reaching over and stabbing them multiple times in the neck - the kind of gruesome move we&#x27;ve seen many times in other stealth combat games. Except A Plague Tale, the first game, wasn&#x27;t really a stealth combat game - it was more about running away and hiding and being smart. That&#x27;s what made it stand out. 
Amicia also packs a crossbow in the sequel, which she uses, and she can garrotte people with some chord. All she had in the first game was a slingshot, which wasn&#x27;t entirely capable of one-shot kills. It was more of a utility/distraction tool.

                              <span>Asobo&#x27;s ceaseless expansion of the wonderful Microsoft Flight Simulator continues onward, with tonight&#x27;s Xbox showcase some of the new additions arriving before the end of the year - including a significant 40th anniversary update scheduled for November, and, rather unexpectedly, Halo Infinite&#x27;s Pelican, which launches as a free update today.


Microsoft hasn&#x27;t revealed how the Pelican will fit into the overall Flight Simulator experience just yet, but you can get a gimpse of the ship in the trailer below. It&#x27;s a different story for the free 40th Anniversary Edition update, however, which has been detailed in significantly more detail.
Described as a &quot;comprehensive celebration of the franchise&quot;, it promises to pay tribute to the series&#x27; past as well as introduce new aircraft types. The latter additions include the long-awaited arrival of helicopters and gliders, brought to life with a new Fluid Dynamics Simulation.

                              <span>As part of Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s showcase this evening, the next Forza Motorsport was finally announced. And, we also now have an idea of when it will be zooming our way - spring 2023. On its release it will be coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC. As well as this, Forza Motorsport will also be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription service on day one.
Along with this announcement, Dan Greenawalt and the game&#x27;s director Chris Esaki popped in for a chat about their game. It&#x27;s the most technically advanced racing game ever apparently, so that&#x27;s exciting. We also got told about its dynamic time of day feature, the weather for each track and the inclusion of raytracing. This was all shown off with a clip from the fictional circuit known as Maple Valley.
The twosome also says there&#x27;s a 48x improvement in the accuracy of the simulation - but, as Martin has asked, what does that mean, and how does it feel? I guess we won&#x27;t find out for a while.

                              <span>It feels like there&#x27;s been an awful lot of horror at this year&#x27;s Game Fest thing in Los Angeles. Today Xbox got in on the act opening its showcase with a proper look at Redfall, the co-op shooter about blasting vampires and cultists.


Redfall&#x27;s the work of Arkane Austin, and today&#x27;s overview mixed up a bit of gameplay with a look at the playable characters. We start approaching a spooky church and then head up into the spire where vampires are leaping about. Shotguns and nice vampire-burning-up effects ensue, and then we&#x27;re off to learn a bit about the town.


The titular Redfall is an island community in Massachusets apparently, but now the whole place has gone to heck. Vampires have blocked out the sun, drained all the water, and cut the town off. (Wouldn&#x27;t draining the water do the opposite?) Expect spooky Americana, like a funfair and an old cinema which appears to have the wilderness growing inside. Expect Left 4 Dead-type action as you take on different enemy types.

&quot;Arctic Awakening is a narrative adventure, where your choices affect the decisions of those around you. Your actions will change your relationship with your companions and even your story itself,&quot; the studio explains, hinting that the environment itself is a character that is &quot;not always on your side&quot;.

                              <span>Pre-registration for the Diablo 4 beta is now open.

Whilst there&#x27;s still no date yet on when the beta will go live, players keen to get an early peek at Blizzard&#x27;s highly-anticipated sequel can sign up now to register their interest in playing on Blizzard&#x27;s own Battle.net PC launcher, Xbox Series X/S, or PS5.

That&#x27;s right; it looks like you&#x27;ll need the latest iteration from both Xbox and Sony to get involved in the Diablo 4 beta.

That&#x27;s according to Hollywood Reporter, which confirms that the shooter is getting the &quot;feature film treatment&quot; from the team behind the Cobra Kai TV show. 

Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg - which created Cobra Kai - have all signed up to produce the Legendary Entertainment production, which also brought us the Godzilla and Dune movies. Also producing is Jean Julien Baronnet, who worked on the Assassin&#x27;s Creed movie with Marla Studios, which reportedly &quot;specialises&quot; in video game adaptations.

                              <span>Almost exactly a year after its announcement, Netflix has offered a first tiny glimpse of its animated, French-Revolution-era Castlevania spin-off, revealing its name to be Nocturne.


Castlevania: Nocturne will follow the adventures of two characters that should be immediately familiar to fans of the video games - Richter Belmont (a distant descendant of original Netflix series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - with its vampiric action playing out against the backdrop of the French Revolution, circa 1792.


 Powerhouse, the studio behind Netflix&#x27;s original animated Castlevania series will once again be on animation duties for Nocturne, with Kevin Kolde serving as showrunner and Clive Bradley being credited as &quot;creator/writer&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been clamouring for the further televisual adventures of Cuphead and Mugman, Netflix has some good news; the streaming service has confirmed the animated series&#x27; second season will arrive 19th August.


Season one of The Cuphead Show was well-received when it launched earlier this year, proving to be a hugely enjoyable adaptation of Studio MDHR&#x27;s acclaimed run-and-gunner. Cuphead&#x27;s second season will, unsurprisingly, continues where its predecessor left often, featuring the further misadventures of Cuphead, Mugman, and friends on Inkwell Isle.
Season 2 will feature another 12 15-minute episodes, and a further 12 episodes will follow sometime after that, completing Netflix&#x27;s previously confirmed three-season, 36 episode run.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we&#x27;re digesting last night&#x27;s big Summer Game Fest show, and the start of this year&#x27;s not-E3 few weeks. How&#x27;s it all been so far? Well, the PlayStation State of Play was pretty good, actually.


As for Geoff Keighley&#x27;s show last night, well... there were plenty of announcements in last night&#x27;s showcase, though few genuine surprises. Here we share our favourites, rate the night overall, and provide our best impressions of the Clickers from The Last of Us. Joining me, as ever, are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.


Of course, this year has seen the traditional E3 model splintered further - and we&#x27;re still to see two platform holders take their turn in the spotlight. We&#x27;ll be back next week to break down the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase, plus  perhaps even a Nintendo Direct. Thanks for watching, and have a lovely weekend!

                              <span>PlayStation fans fearing a delay to God of War Ragnarök can breathe a sigh of relief. 


Despite widespread speculation, Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s highly-anticipated sequel is due to arrive this November, Bloomberg reported today.


Of course, there&#x27;s still time between then and now for things to change. And, reportedly, things already have - the game was once set for September, before being shuffled back internally by two months.

The news was confirmed by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski in a Sonic livestream.


&quot;While unfortunately we can&#x27;t use all the original sounds from the Sega Genesis version of the game, Jun Senoue has been working really hard to adapt the original music that was composed in 1993 for Sonic Origins,&quot; said Chrzanowski.

                              <span>Following a successful debut, Annupurna Interactive will be hosting its showcase once again this year, with the publisher promising &quot;reveals, announcements, and much more&quot;.
 This year&#x27;s show will take place on 28th July at 8pm UK time (12pm PT / 3pm ET), and will be streamed across the official Annapurna Interactive Twitch and YouTube channels.
We also have a new teaser that gives us a sneak peak of what lies ahead (sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean to make that sound quite so ominous - it looks like a really nice variety of showings). You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>This month&#x27;s Pokémon Go Community Day is going to be an interesting one - and not least due to its choice of featured creature, the pseudo-Legendary Deino.


As well as the monthly event&#x27;s typical in-game bonuses and good chances at catching a Deino&#x27;s Shiny version, developer Niantic is also using the event to roll-out a couple of brand new features. 


In a twist, players will be able to extend the event&#x27;s three-hour runtime in their local area by raiding at gyms after the 11am-2pm window concludes. The raids will feature Deino&#x27;s evolved form Zweilous, and hatch from a new type of raid egg that can only be tackled by players in person (so, no remote raid passes!).

All five will be included from next year&#x27;s awards. That includes awards for songwriting, song for social change, and poetry.


The Grammy Awards, America&#x27;s most prestigious music award ceremony, aims to encapsulate all elements of the music industry, so the Best Score Soundtrack For Video Games And Other Interactive Media should fit in neatly.

Turner, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is a British designer who spent more than a decade at Pokémon maker Game Freak, and was one of its first Western employees. Now he&#x27;s formed his own indie studio, All Possible Futures. 


A trailer for The Plucky Squire shows its dinky hero scampering through pages of a picture book, before leaping out into the 3D world of its surroundings. Here it is:

It&#x27;s skateboarding with a twist, then, and features a truly unique art style. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Last night, Naughty Dog officially unveiled its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for the PS5, and confirmed it will also make its way to PC in the future. Ahead of this reveal, we also got our first look at the price - $70 - via a leak online. That in itself was enough to cause many to raise an eyebrow, as while the game certainly does look smoother thanks to its current gen make-over, it is also a game that has been released twice before.
Today, we now have even more information on this release, such as the three editions that will be released. And I am sorry to say this folks, but that £70/$70 will only get you the base game and its prequel Left Behind. If you want to get your hands on the The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s  Digital Deluxe edition, you are going to have to part ways with £80/$80. Meanwhile, if you are looking to purchase The Last of Us Part I Firefly Edition, which is only available to buy as an exclusive directly from PlayStation in the US, you are looking at just shy of $100.
So, what exactly do you get with these editions to make them worth the money?

                              <span>Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest - which aired last night, in case you missed it - will return as both a digital and physical event next year, the host has announced.



This will, presumably, put the show in direct competition with E3 - which has also announced a plan to return next year digitally and in-person.


Keighley, of course, previously worked on programming at E3 before the two went separate ways. And while the physical E3 event has been cancelled the past two years, Summer Game Fest has been angled as something of a replacement.

Time Flies


Time Flies is the work of Michael Frei and Mario von Rickenbach, the developers behind the acclaimed Kids, and explores the limited time we have on Earth from the perspective of a fly. After entering your location, you&#x27;re allotted a set amount of time (based on your country&#x27;s average life expectancy) to explore the inside of a house and puzzle out ways to complete a bucket list of activities, ranging from getting rich to making a friend. Time Flies is coming to Playstation, Switch, PC, and Mac next year.

For the curious, Darktide is a spiritual follow-up to Fatshark&#x27;s previous four-player co-op games, Warhammer: Vermintide and Vermintide 2, which are a bit like medieval Left 4 Deads but with giant rats. This one&#x27;s set in the even grimmer and darker universe of the year 40K.
And it&#x27;s all quite supremely 40K, by the looks of things. We get a nice glimpse of the four classes - Psyker, Veteran, Zealot, Ogryn - blowing apart the hordes of cultists-cum-space-zombies in different ways.

Baker and Johnson, who play Joel and Ellie in Naughty Dog&#x27;s games, took to the stage during Summer Game Fest alongside The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann. Here, the duo revealed that, while they can&#x27;t say which characters they will be playing, they are very excited to be part of the show. They also introduced the leaked PlayStation 5 remake of Part 1 officially. You can see the trailer for it below.
Meanwhile, back to the show. Along with the news of Baker and Johnson&#x27;s upcoming roles, we also got a nice new picture from it. Here it is:

                              <span>If you wanted to get a closer look at the customisation options that are in store for you ahead of Saints Row&#x27;s release this August, you&#x27;re in luck. Today, Volition unveiled its free to download Saints Row: Boss Factory. 
As you may have guessed, Boss Factory offers you the chance to really get stuck into the game&#x27;s character creator and make your own Boss (or Bosses plural, as you can indeed have up to six of them saved) and then have them ready to go for Saints Row&#x27;s full release.
You will have access to all of the game&#x27;s Boss customisation options, bar special progression-locked items (so yes, you can play around with those modesty emojis to your heart&#x27;s content).

                              <span>We had been promised that a new The Last of Us multiplayer component would be coming, and now we have a little bit more information on it. 
Its not much, but Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann has revealed a new piece of concept art (see the image above) for it and said it will be as big as any single-player game the team has done, if not bigger – which given the size of Part 2 is quite the claim! 
This multiplayer will have its own storyline and it takes place in another part of the United States. Is that the Golden Gate Bridge we can see over there? Hmm. Why, yes. Yes, I think it is.

                              <span>Following a tiny tease last October, Bloober Team - the developer behind the psychedelic horror chills of The Medium, Observer, and Blair Witch - has finally unveiled its latest Layers of Fear project: a remake of the previous two games in the series (plus DLC) bundled into a single, connected package for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.


Layers of Fears, to give the new experience its official (and faintly ridiculous) name, has been co-developed with Anshar Studios, and sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 to form what Bloober is calling a &quot;psychological horror chronicle&quot; - complete with new visuals, gameplay, and expanded plot lines.


Bloober says these new story elements will &quot;cast a new light on the overarching narrative&quot; as players face &quot;spine-chilling madness that extends over generations.&quot;

In a fresh trailer we saw a previously-unrevealed six-player online and local multiplayer option. Casey Jones is playable, too.


We also got a release date for the game - and it&#x27;s soon. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge launches for PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation and Xbox including via Game Pass on 16th June.

We only got to see a short CGI trailer as a tease, which featured robot enemies and some of that derelict lunar research station mentioned by indie developer Lunar Software 10 years ago.
After its initial announcement in 2012, Routine received some development updates, but got delayed multiple times, and here we are ten years after with the Summer Game Fest trailer, which you can check out below.

American Arcadia, which was initially teased earlier this year, takes place in a retro-futuristic metropolis where the citizens have no idea they&#x27;re actually contestants on the most watched reality show on the planet.


What follows is a daring escape - presented as a documentary, complete with interviews and police interrogations - as players take control of two different characters in two different locations, each with their own playstyles.

                              <span>At tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, we got a look at upcoming indie game Highwater from publisher Rogue Games and developer Demagog .
It is a colourful and playfully chunky looking strategy game, but one with a somber undertone. As the name suggests, it focuses on a world ravaged by the effects of global warming and the resulting high water levels. It also features a city called Alphaville, so yes, while I am writing this up, I am also singing Big in Japan. 
Here is the trailer for you to enjoy yourself.

                              <span>Flashback, the Delphine platformer from 1992, has a sequel on the way. It&#x27;s called Flashback 2, but the 2 is very small so it looks sciencey.


We&#x27;ve known about this for a while, but we&#x27;ve just got a proper glimpse of the game  at Geoff&#x27;s Summer Games Fest thing. I say proper glimpse -  the trailer&#x27;s stylish but tricky to read too much into. There&#x27;s lots of mantling and side-on platforming and the suggestion that physics and big robots both play a part, so that&#x27;s all okay with us.


Flashback 2 will be out this Winter on all the consoles and PC by the looks of it. Microids is in charge.

If you&#x27;re not up to date, this is the sequel to the 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which rebooted the series and re-imagined some of its popular characters.


Here we find them boarding a ship and getting into all sorts of shooty business. There&#x27;s a bit of that fancy water which Wes reported on in his earlier look at the game, too.

                              <span>Its Summer Game Fest time, and things have been kicked off with a trip into outer space. Yes, we have our first look at Dead Space 4. Sorry, I mean The Callisto Protocol (easy mistake to make).
As you would expect, it is a bloody horror filled rampage against some pretty ugly looking fellas. I am talking limbs coming off left, right and centre. There is also a look at a gravity gun in use, and our protagonist stomping down on a felled enemy&#x27;s corpse (because you just would if that thing came at you!). 
We also get to see, erm, well, someone getting trapped in a fan of sorts, resulting in them getting mushed up. To sum up, it&#x27;s unpleasant, clausterphobic and, won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;m here for it. See what you think for yourself below.

                              <span>Those pesky Xenomorphs are heading back PC and consoles next year in the newly announced Aliens: Dark Descent.


Coming from developer Tindalos Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment, Aliens: Dark Descent is described as a &quot;squad-based, single-player action game&quot; that sees players commanded their soldiers in real-time as they take on Xenomorphs - including Facehuggers, Praetorians, and Alien Queens - as well as rogue operatives from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.


&quot;Infiltrate large open levels and annihilate enemies with your squad, dispatching orders strategically and intuitively at the touch of a button,&quot; the game&#x27;s newly launched Steam page explains. &quot;Tread carefully, as your foes will adapt their tactics to your actions while hunting you down because death is permanent. Forge unique paths for survival, uncovering shortcuts, creating safe zones, and setting up motion trackers in a persistent world where your actions impact levels forever.&quot;

Moss: Book 2, which picks up immediately after the events of the first game, once again builds its action around a hybrid of first-person and third-person perspectives as players, in the role of an omniscient spirit, help guide mouse protagonist Quill on her quest to free the land from the clutches of the evil Arcane.


Polyarc&#x27;s sequel initially launched for PSVR earlier this year, and Eurogamer&#x27;s resident virtual reality aficionado Ian Higton was delighted to revisit the series&#x27; cinematic blend of puzzling and combat in his glowing Moss: Book 2 review.

                              <span>Ahead of tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, Sony&#x27;s The Last of Us Part 1 remake - one of the worst kept secrets in the industry today - has leaked. So yes, it is real. And not only is it really real, but it will also be releasing as soon as 2nd September for the PlayStation 5 at a retail price of $70. 
To accompany this news, we got our first look at the remake in action thanks to a brand-new trailer. You can check it out for yourself by following this link.
As you can see, the Ellie and Joel that we first met all the way back in 2013 now have a much sleeker look, but it is most certainly still them. There is fighting, there is compassion, and there are enough clickers to give one spores for thought throughout this reveal. Rather nicely, the game&#x27;s DLC - Left Behind - will also be included in this remake.

                              <span>A couple of months back, reddit user Shin was beavering away at an Elden Ring Game Boy remake.


And now it&#x27;s out! Available to play on itch.io, the game offers a miniature green-tinged version of the Lands Between - or at least, the Precipice of Anticipation, Northern Limgrave, and Stormveil Castle - presented in a Zelda-inspired top-down fashion.


The game runs in-browser, but Shin recommends using real Game Boy hardware or an Analogue Pocket for saving, better colours, and higher accuracy.

Dialogue between Kamala Khan and her high school friends revealed they play Super Smash Bros together - meaning Nintendo&#x27;s all-star fighter is now Marvel Cinematic Universe canon.


Kamala herself seemed to be a fan of Smash, though her friend Nakia was less keen.

A temporary fix was initially deployed which restricted the Battle Pass from granting unlocks (while progression would still be tracked).
However, work on a permanent fix led to the return of the same errors, leading DICE to revert all changes.

Microsoft announced a deal with Samsung to bring the Xbox App to 2022 Smart TVs at the end of the month, so you can play cloud-enabled Game Pass Ultimate games without a console.

Microsoft said playing Xbox games on 2022 Samsung TVs will be a seamless experience, similar to using any other streaming app on your telly. It also means you can play Fortnite via Xbox Cloud Gaming for free and without a subscription on your telly.

The new feature is expected to launch later this year, Microsoft said.


Microsoft&#x27;s announcement on this is pretty vague - there&#x27;s not much to go on beyond it&#x27;s a feature that&#x27;s coming out later in 2022. We don&#x27;t have a list of the &quot;select&quot; games that will work here, either.

Set to roll out within the next year, Project Moorcroft will see Microsoft pay developers to create demos of their upcoming games and bring them to the subscription service. Microsoft did not say whether there&#x27;s a mandated time-limit for these demos, or how long they will stick around the subscription service after launch.


The program kicks off with a focus on demos for indie games and helping their developers get data about and build excitement for their games.

The remaster of both Grand Theft Auto 5 and Online was first announced back in 2020 during the reveal of the PlayStation 5.

                              <span>While official photos from the set of HBO&#x27;s upcoming The Last of Us adaptation have been thin on the ground, the internet is always watching.
Today, we have been given a closer look at Bella Ramsay as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel on set, and it is actually pretty heartwarming. 
As shown in the tweet below, the two can be seen resting their weary heads on each other as production on the show goes on around them.

                              <span>As the Call of Duty community got its first real glimpse of Modern Warfare 2 (and we&#x27;re expecting more later today at Summer Game Fest), a lot of questions were still left unanswered. 


Fortunately, we got some new details from members of its Infinity Ward development team, courtesy of VentureBeat. 


First, as described in Eurogamer&#x27;s preview yesterday, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the engine&#x27;s fancy new water tech.

                              <span>When you think of CD Projekt Red and the word Cyberpunk together, you do get a certain thought in your head. Yes, we all get visions of that disastrous launch. However, this could all be about to change, as a new trailer and some bonus footage from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime has been revealed, and it looks pretty damn amazing in my eyes. 
The trailer, via Netflix, doesn&#x27;t give much away in terms of story beats, but it certainly sets the scene. There is neon, there is angst, there are explostions and gunfire a plenty and, oh yes, there are motorbikes.
Check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>With last night&#x27;s trailer reveal for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, fans of Activision&#x27;s largest franchise were left with sour taste after discovering the publisher has raised the price of last-gen versions of the game. 


Pre-ordering the game for either PlayStation 4 or Xbox One will cost players £69.99. That&#x27;s a hefty £10 increase from the asking for price for the franchise&#x27;s last title: Vanguard. 


The price rise is explained by the fact players are now forced to purchase the &quot;Cross-Gen Bundle,&quot; which includes both the last-gen and current-gen versions of the game.

                              <span>A new report into the development of Bethesda&#x27;s widely derided Fallout 76 has painted a picture of a studio in disarray, as poor management, a lack of design direction, and engine challenges created an environment of apathy, confusion, crunch, and burnout, and a game that ultimately failed to resonate with players.


Announced in 2018 and launched the following year, Fallout 76 - an online take on Bethesda&#x27;s beloved post-apocalyptic RPG series - was less than well-received at launch. Eurogamer&#x27;s Wesley Yin-Poole even went as far as to call it a &quot;bizarre, boring, broken mess&quot; before slapping it with an avoid badge.


Now, a lengthy new report from Kotaku - based on conversations with 10 former employees of Bethesda and parent company ZeniMax Media - has shed fresh light on the troubled development that lead to such a poorly received game, one seemingly doomed from the start.

                              <span>EA has responded to new claims Battlefield 2042 has entered &#x27;abandon ship&#x27; mode, insisting reports that only a skeleton crew is left working on the beleaguered shooter  are &quot;untrue&quot;.


Word that Battlefield 2042&#x27;s post-launch development has been dramatically downscaled was first shared by journalist Jeff Grubb on his Grubbsnax Giant Bomb show, where he claimed the remaining team has been tasked with delivering the four seasons of live service content promised to purchasers the &quot;fastest and the cheapest it possibly can&quot;.


&quot;This game is basically down to a skeleton crew,&quot; Grubb told viewers (thanks VGC). &quot;It&#x27;s down to like the bare bones and those people are specifically just working on the promised additional seasons that the game needs to meet the requirements of the high-end version that it sold.&quot;

                              <span>While the wait for more news on the second season of acclaimed League of Legends animated series Arcane continues, Riot Games has announced it&#x27;ll be airing a five-part making-of series for season one starting this August.


Arcane Act 1, as season one was officially known, launched on Netflix last November, charting the early years of two of League of Legends&#x27; most popular champions, sisters Jinx and Vi, in an around the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun.


The response from critics and League of Legends fans was strong (Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell called it &quot;absolutely a thrill, full of welcome colour and life&quot;, despite a few reservations), and Riot confirmed a second season was in the works mere weeks after season one&#x27;s arrival.

                              <span>The PC version of Call of Duty returns to Steam five years after ditching the platform in favour of Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.net.


Activision today confirmed Infinity Ward&#x27;s upcoming shooter Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on Steam as well as Battle.net when it comes out on 28th October.


It marks the return of the shooter franchise to Valve&#x27;s platform five years after Sledgehammer&#x27;s Call of Duty: WW2 came out in November 2017. That game went down as the last new PC Call of Duty to appear on Steam, with all subsequent mainline games (Black Ops 4, Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War and Vanguard), as well as free-to-play battle royale Warzone releasing on Battle.net exclusively.

                              <span>Following its unveiling back in March, developer ClockStone, the studio behind the popular Bridge Constructor series, has shared 16 minutes of gameplay from its upcoming diorama-based construction puzzler Lego Bricktales.


Lego Bricktales tasks players with traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they undertake various quests and puzzles dished out by NPCs to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


Bricktales&#x27; core puzzling is based around a brick-by-brick building mechanic that encourages players to find a solution to the task at hand by constructing something useful from a limited number of bricks - a bridge, perhaps, or a physics-based flying machine.

Set in the world of Fódlan and featuring the same cast of characters as Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Three Hopes is an action musou take on the game. That means battles against hundreds of enemies and a big cast of characters to play as, depending on the house you choose.


News of the demo comes alongside a new trailer featuring a fresh look at gameplay.

                              <span>Some players are finding themselves unable to access EA games on PlayStation and Xbox if their console accounts are tied to an EA account with an expired password.


The problem centres around the fact that many players created EA accounts in the distant past - for one reader who got in contact, it was over a decade ago - and tied it to an email address that has long since been shut down. For anyone with a now-abandoned school or work email, it&#x27;s a similar story. 


Now, when EA&#x27;s account system asks for a password reset, it can only send an email to that lost address.

                              <span>Following its reveal and subsequent delay, Evil West now has a solid release date. So, get your weapons and holsters ready, as we will be blasting off into a rather weird looking version of the Wild West on 20th September.
Along with this news, we also have a brand-new trailer to enjoy. Expect plenty of chaos to unfold here, as we meet gunslinging ornery cowboy type Jesse Rentier. 

 To my eyes, Evil West looks like a mashup of Red Dead Redemption and Resident Evil but with more lightning. See what you think  below.

However, there is a catch. This will just be its beta (or &quot;flight&quot; in the words of developer 343 industries), and not the real deal. That is still slated to come some time later this year.
If you want to have a shot at this test flight, you will have to register to become a Halo Insider. This program is the &quot;official way for Halo fans and community members to partner with 343 Industries to help improve our games, products, and services.&quot;

A &quot;significant number&quot; of staff have now been laid off in order to meet &quot;dramatically reined in operating costs&quot;, Intellivision boss Phil Adam wrote in an email to customers, which has in turn led to further issues. 


However, Intellivision appears to be adamant it will still release the Amico at some point.

It&#x27;s a similarly styled sim game, this time taking place in space - obviously. Players will construct a spaceship and go on adventures across multiple, procedurally generated star systems.


The team is quick to note the game is not even in alpha yet, but has released a lengthy video showing off gameplay with placeholder art - give it a watch below.

While Microsoft has not yet commented on his departure, an internal email sent on Tuesday and seen by Geek Wire confirmed Kipman&#x27;s exit, framing it as a company restructure. 
Within the email, head of Microsoft&#x27;s Cloud and AI Group Scott Guthrie said the changes being made &quot;will align and further accelerate [Microsoft&#x27;s] overall Metaverse efforts as a company this coming fiscal year&quot;.

Already in developer testing before a full public rollout this autumn, iOS 16 will allow you to use Nintendo&#x27;s controllers to play games - or do anything else app makers might imagine.

                              <span>Nintendo is reportedly figuring out what to do with a completed sequel to party game 1-2-Switch that has &quot;tested horribly&quot; among its target audience.


According to Fanbyte writer Imran Khan, citing multiple sources familiar with the game&#x27;s development, Nintendo made the decision to begin work on a 1-2-Switch sequel - reportedly known as Everybody&#x27;s 1-2-Switch - after the the original shifted a respectable 3.45m copies.


After several iterations, Nintendo is said to have settled on an idea inspired by the Jackbox Party Pack series for its 1-2-Switch sequel, where multiple players (up to 100 in some cases) could use their smartphones to compete in game-show-like mini-game challenges hosted by a man in a rubber horse mask. Reportedly, this somewhat radical shift in focus for the series was to ensure a too-similar sequel didn&#x27;t eat into the original mini-game compilation&#x27;s ongoing sales.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Bend Studio, the developer perhaps best known for 2019&#x27;s post-apocalyptic bikes-and-zombies adventure Days Gone, has revealed a little more on its next project, a new IP that&#x27;ll include multiplayer and build on the open-world systems of Days Gone.


The Oregon-based studio - which worked on the likes of Syphon Filter, Resistance: Retribution, and Uncharted: Golden Abyss, and was acquired by Sony in 2000 - shared word on its latest venture in a PlayStation Blog post unveiling its new logo.


Bend&#x27;s new logo, designed to represent an &quot;abstract and modern interpretation of the studio&#x27;s history, location, and lifestyle&quot;, is accompanied by a closer look at the developer&#x27;s output over the last 29 years, culminating with a tease of its future.

                              <span>As if Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest wasn&#x27;t enough Fest to be getting on with, Valve has starting cranking the hype handle for its own Fest, Steam Next Fest, which returns for another demo-packed seven days starting Monday, 13th June.


This latest tumble into demo-land was confirmed by Valve back in March, when it promised &quot;hundreds&quot; of &quot;cool demos&quot; throughout the week, alongside developer livestreams, chats, and other assorted activities.


Proceedings get underway at 6pm BST/10am PT next Monday, 13th June, and will continue until the following Monday, 20th June. That&#x27;ll give you seven days to gorge on as many demos as possible (an increasingly daunting proposition the bigger Steam Next Fest gets), after which they&#x27;ll disappear once more.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima, designer of the legendary Metal Gear series and 2019&#x27;s Death Stranding, is reportedly working on a new horror game starring actress Margaret Qualley called Overdose.


That&#x27;s according to ceaseless leaker Tom Henderson, who, writing for Try Hard Guides, claims to have been sent early footage featuring a character - portrayed by Qualley, who previously played Mama in Death Stranding - roaming through dark corridors with a flashlight in her hand.


Henderson says the sequence (displayed from a third-person perspective, although a first-person mode is also rumoured) culminates in a jump scare that brings a Game Over message up on screen. That&#x27;s reportedly followed by the caption &quot;A Hideo Kojima Game... OVERDOSE&quot;.

                              <span>With E3 yet again absent from the gaming calendar and Geoff Keighley readying to return this week with his Summer Game Fest alternative, the ESA has re-emerged with a reminder it&#x27;s planning to bring E3 back as both a digital and in-person event next year.


E3&#x27;s future has been looking increasingly uncertain in recent times, given the ESA&#x27;s continuing struggle to adequately adapt the show in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The event has been cancelled twice in the last three years - first in 2020 and again this year - with 2021&#x27;s virtual event proving to be a decidedly lacklustre affair.


But even before coronavirus, E3&#x27;s domination of the gaming calendar was growing ever-more wobbly, as an increasing number of publishers - including Sony, EA, and Activision - all abandoned the show in order to focus on their own bespoke events outside of the E3 umbrella.

                              <span>Minecraft&#x27;s long-awaited The Wild Update arrives today and finally adds the game&#x27;s intriguing Deep Dark biome: a fresh slab of world for you to explore, underneath the game&#x27;s previously-permanent bedrock. It adds new enemies, fancy new building blocks and some odd new structures, left by past explorers. It&#x27;s something fans have been wanting to dig into for some time.


Mojang originally announced Deep Dark almost two years ago, back at Minecraft Live in 2020. At the time, the biome was set to be part of the game&#x27;s 2021 Caves and Cliffs Update (an offering that was further reshuffled after Caves and Cliffs was split in two). So, why the delay? What&#x27;s been happening with Minecraft in the interim? And what&#x27;s going on with that Jason Momoa Minecraft movie? I sat down with Minecraft&#x27;s game director Agnes Larsson and gameplay developer Ulraf Vakninthe to find out more.


&quot;We felt for a while &#x27;this is a risk but we might be able to do it&#x27;,&quot; Larsson told me, of Deep Dark&#x27;s original intended release date. &quot;But then when we realised [we had to delay], we tried to take the decision really quickly because we would risk making people in the team very, very stressed out. And we also communicated about it really quickly because we wanted to be as transparent as possible about such a big decision.

                              <span>Korean studio NCSoft has released a trailer for its forthcoming dramatic thriller Project M.


Developed in Unreal Engine 5 and releasing on console, the team is aiming for ultra-realistic graphics - and it&#x27;s certainly achieving that.


Judging by a blog post accompanying the trailer, NCSoft appear to be using 3D scanning, motion capture, and special effects, resulting in some incredibly detailed character models. You can see it in action in the trailer below.

Shantae director Matt Bozon revealed this news on the PlayStation blog, where he shared a trip down the series&#x27; memory lane in honour of its 20th anniversary. 
Here, he revealed that Shantae was first conceived by his wife, Erin Bozon, in a bid to get more women and girls into video games.

                              <span>Court documents detailing the sentencing of Nintendo game pirate Gary Bowser have shed new light on how his 40-month sentence was designed to deter others from similar crimes.


Back in February, Bowser was told he would serve 40 months behind bars - more than three years - after pleading guilty to his part in the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices.


Now, newly-detailed documentation dug up by Axios and Kotaku has revealed how Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers and US district judge Robert Lasnik discussed Bowser&#x27;s jail time as a means to set an example - even as Bowser&#x27;s own lawyers argued his physical health was at risk, and argued that Bowser had already spent 16 months locked up awaiting trial.

                              <span>Former Arkane Lyon studio director Romuald Capron has joined the new Paris-based studio ZeDrimeTim to work on a new 1950s science fiction platformer.


The studio&#x27;s first game, Darwin&#x27;s Paradox, is a platform adventure game for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S that draws inspiration from Inside, Limbo, and Little Nightmares for a game &quot;filled with humour and influenced by the Golden Age of the 1950s science fiction and today&#x27;s 3D animation feature films&quot;.


It&#x27;s being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and will be released in early 2024.

The MMO military vehicle combat game from Gaijin Entertainment has a fervent fanbase that demands realism from the developers.


But once again that&#x27;s gone too far, as classified documents of the DTC10-125 Chinese anti-tank missile have been leaked by fans in a further bid for realism.

Modder AlexKage is behind OlympusExtra, available now on NexusMods (thanks Games Radar), which aims to add new gods, boons, voices and more.




Apollo, the first to be added, is the god of music - though he&#x27;s often also associated with the sun, as he took over riding its mythological golden chariot from Helios.

The game in question is called Grit and, well, it looks a lot like something that rhymes with grit but that I am too polite to write here. 
At its Galaverse convention yesterday, developer Gala Games revealed it had &quot;signed a partnership with Epic&quot;, presumably to release the title via its storefront. Gala then went on to chat more about Grit, its wild-west themed battle royale which you can see in the trailer above.

The decision - unanimously agreed by all 16 voters at Keywords Studios - means collective bargaining on worker rights will now begin. 


This drive for unionisation comes amid a wider push for video game worker unions in the US, and after a previous squabble between staff and Keywords bosses over returning to work in-office.

One idea was a battle royale mode featuring only blue mages - the unique job that learns skills and magic by battling enemies.

That&#x27;s a nice bit of expectation-setting, then - don&#x27;t expect reveals of unannounced games. Then again, there&#x27;s still plenty Capcom has now revealed which it can discuss in more detail: including the &quot;reimagined&quot; Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6.

                              <span>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has spoken out about a fake Fortnite cryptocurrency account known as Fortnite Token, calling it a scam and nothing to do with Epic&#x27;s battle royale and its trademarks. In fact, Epic is calling in its lawyers to shut the whole thing down
A series of tweets between the CEO and the Fortnite Token account reveal the full extent of Sweeny&#x27;s disdain for the cryptocurrency market (at least when it comes to Fortnite).
&quot;There isn&#x27;t a Fortnite cryptocurrency,&quot; he stated &quot;The Twitter accounts promoting such a thing are a scam. Epic&#x27;s lawyers are on it.&quot;

Capcom revealed the feature via a short clip posted to Twitter, below, that shows Luke and Ryu change their facial expression a couple of times with the camera up close and personal.


&quot;Show your attitude with the Game Face Feature in #StreetFighter6 by pressing directional buttons during the versus screen,&quot; reads the tweet.

                              <span>DICE will be revealing first gameplay of the beleaguered Battlefield 2042&#x27;s long-awaited Season 1 this Tuesday, 7th June, and there&#x27;s a new update promising &quot;hundreds of changes, bug fixes and quality of life improvements&quot; due on the same day.
DICE has, of course, been steadily working to improve Battlefield 2042 since its launch last November, when it quickly become one of Steam&#x27;s worst-reviewed games of all time. While the developer has committed to bringing this latest Battlefield &quot;up to the highest standards that we all hold for the franchise&quot;, it&#x27;s only now, some eight months after its release, that players will finally get a first look at the game&#x27;s long-delayed first season of post-launch content.
Those curious to see what DICE has in store for Battlefield 2042&#x27;s first season, known as Zero Hour, will be able to see its gameplay premiere tomorrow, Tuesday 7th June at 4pm/8am PDT.

                              <span>Acclaimed point-and-click specialist Wadjet Eye Games - the studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the celebrated Blackwell series - has unveiled its latest contribution to the genre, time-travelling adventure Old Skies.


Old Skies cast players as Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers who&#x27;ve paid for a sightseeing jaunt to the past. &quot;Some are simply curious,&quot; explains Wadjet Eye. &quot;Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It&#x27;s only time travel, after all.&quot;


Wadjet Eye is promising seven distinct time periods from history to explore - &quot;from the speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age to the morning of September 11th&quot; - with puzzles set to take advantage of the game&#x27;s temporal premise.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s live-action adaptation of Capcom&#x27;s survival horror classic Resident Evil has received another trailer ahead of its 14th July release.


The new live-action series - not to be confused with Netflix&#x27;s four-episode CGI effort Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, which launched last year - splits its Racoon-City-focused storyline across two distinct timelines, straddling either side of a global apocalypse caused by a deadly virus.


At one end, pre-apocalypse, we follow the adventures of teenage sisters Jade and Billie Wesker as they begin to notice strange things are afoot in New Racoon City. Then, 14 years later in 2036, Jade takes centre-stage as she struggles to survive in a world overrun by the blood-thirsty infected and ponders the fate of her sister.

Ahead of its airing, however, host Geoff Keighley has warned viewers expecting major reveals to &quot;manage your expectations&quot;, saying the event will be &quot;primarily focused&quot; on already announced games.


Speaking during a Twitter Spaces audio session over the weekend (as transcribed by VGC), Keighley said he was &quot;very excited&quot; about the titles set to feature during Thursday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, but warned viewers to &quot;definitely manage your expectations in terms of the megaton shocks that you’re expecting. This is not The Game Awards.&quot;


&quot;We’ve got lots of good stuff to show you,&quot; he added, &quot;but buyer beware of some of the crazy rumours I&#x27;m seeing out there in terms of things people expect to get announced.&quot;

                              <span>The climbing mechanic in Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End almost saw lithe hero Nathan Drake come with his own little stamina bar in a bid to give an extra layer of difficulty to the game.
Naughty Dog&#x27;s Josh Scherr, who co-wrote A Thief&#x27;s End with Neil Druckmann and then went on to co-write The Lost Legacy, was a guest on YouTube channel Couch Soup over the weekend. Here, Scherr shared more about his illustrious career with Naughty Dog (which has spanned over 20 years) and gave some behind the scenes insight into Uncharted 4&#x27;s development.
Scherr praised the power of PlayStation 4, and said it was &quot;specifically designed to not be super complicated with a cell processor and six SPUs and all that other crazy stuff&quot;, likening it to a &quot;fancy version of a high-end PC&quot;. This means more time for developers to focus on other areas of a game sooner, such as its story development.

First unveiled at the end of last year, fans have been desperate to see gameplay of Sonic Frontiers ever since. Two videos have now been released exclusively to IGN, showcasing the game&#x27;s open world design and its combat.


But so far fans are unhappy with the direction of the game and - just as with Sonic&#x27;s redesign for the film series - are calling for a delay.

The message, from chief people officer Mala Singh, follows internal criticism of EA by some employees for not speaking out sooner in support - as other game developers have. 
&quot;I want to acknowledge the pain and fear that our LGBTQ+, specifically our Transgender community, is experiencing in light of emerging legislation in the US and the ongoing attacks on their human rights,&quot; Singh wrote in post shared on EA&#x27;s blog. &quot;We will continue to strive for a safe and supportive workplace, and as a leadership team, we want to be clear about what we stand for:

However, while great, these games are a product of their time, and as such can look a little rough around the edges. Well, not anymore!
Now, thanks to an emulator developer that goes by the name of Darío, these legendary games have been given not only ray-tracing upgrades, but also object motion blur, widescreen, DLSS and 60+ FPS.

Last season&#x27;s underground base is now a giant rave cavern, with a rollercoaster you can ride using the game&#x27;s returning Baller vehicles (think those spheres from Jurassic World). 


A large chunk of the Island has also been transformed into a punk-fantasy jungle, with an enormous bioluminescent tree you can scamper around.

                              <span>Splitgate&#x27;s beta season two is now live on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.


The new season of the free-to-play portal-hopping shooter brings a number of updates, including three new game modes and a remastered Abyss map.


That&#x27;s on top of revamped matchmaking as part of a migration to a new server, which means getting into matches quicker, fewer bots, and more similarly-skilled opponents.

                              <span>Two things named Gotham Knights are currently set to release over the coming year. One is a video game (coming in the latter half of 2022), and one is a TV show (coming early 2023), and both see a group rallying together to fight the crime in Gotham following Batman&#x27;s demise. 
However, despite sharing a name, an overarching concept and a pretty close launch window, these two have no relation to each other what&#x27;s so ever. Huh.
&quot;Message from the Belfry: the #GothamKnights game and the upcoming TV show of the same name are separate projects with no connection to one another,&quot; Batman Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Montreal tweeted. &quot;We can&#x27;t wait for you to experience the action of our Gotham Knights soon.&quot;

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Go Fest, Pokémon Go&#x27;s annual summer weekend extravangaza, has shaken up the game with the introduction of a new Mythical creature, the arrival of the franchise&#x27;s extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts, and the apparent (albeit likely temporary) loss of everyone&#x27;s favourite hunky professor, Willow.


The disappearance of Willow, a surprise twist for the game&#x27;s second day, means the game has been left without its usual friendly face guiding players through the game&#x27;s story. A mysterious stranger named Rhi, who looks to be a new ally, has instead taken Willow&#x27;s place while players investigate the emergence of the first Ultra Beasts. 


These creatures are likely the cause of Willow&#x27;s absence, and will hopefully be a continued focus over the game&#x27;s new Season of Go. For now at least, Willow&#x27;s absence appears to be a story development that will stick for some time, with standard in-game text changed throughout the app to remove references to the professor. (For those overly concerned, a Go Fest finale event for existing ticket holders, coming in August, seems likely to revolve around his revival.)

                              <span>Sega producer Yosuke Okunari has confirmed that the reason the company didn&#x27;t pursue creating a mini Dreamcast or Saturn because &quot;both developing and manufacturing new chipsets during the pandemic is a difficult and expensive process&quot;.

In an interview with Famitsu, Okunari said - as paraphrased by Gosokkyu (thanks, NintendoLife) - the company did &quot;explore the idea&quot; of a Dreamcast or Saturn Mini but ultimately decided not to pursue it when Sega discovered manufacturing mini consoles had become more expensive post-pandemic (and post semiconductor shortage, of course).

Okunari added that the Mega Drive Mini&#x27;s internals &quot;can&#x27;t adequately handle Saturn games&quot;, and manufacturing new chipsets would be prohibitively expensive, joking that if they&#x27;d proceeded with the idea, the cost of buying a Dreamcast of Saturn Mini could rival that of a modern-day console.

In the wake of the game&#x27;s appearance on Thursday&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play presentation, images purporting to be of 22 Street Fighter 6 characters - many of whom had yet to be formally revealed - popped up online, including all eight World Warriors from Street Fighter 2.

That wasn&#x27;t all, though - the leak also included video clips of the characters, too.

As spotted by our pals over at VGC, Xbox achievement tracker TrueAchievements has been tracking the unlocked - and public - achievements of BIGsheep, an alleged Rare developer who has been working through the game since October 2021.
After a brief hiatus between February and April, the dev has most recently unlocked an achievement called &quot;Merciless&quot;, which awards you for killing an unarmed player in multiplayer.

                              <span>It costs £88,000 ($110,000) to fully upgrade a character in Diablo Immortal.

That&#x27;s according to Bellular News (thanks, GameRant), which has calculated that to fully max out a character, a player would need to spend over $100,000 on microtransactions, as it&#x27;s seemingly not possible to do so without spending real money. You can check out the full breakdown below:

Players in Diablo Immortal have three progression pillars: XP level, equipment level, and Legendary Gems. The first two are pretty standard fare in any RPG-type game, but collating Legendary Gems can be a costly and convoluted process as the way you get them is randomised and often exceedingly rare... and right now, it seems as though F2P players cannot earn them at all.

The press release stops short of detailing much else about the upcoming game - details will be &quot;revealed at a later date&quot;, apparently, although a quick snoop on Disruptive&#x27;s website hints that it&#x27;s coming to PC as well as unspecified PlayStation and Xbox consoles - but Disruptive Games has worked on several notable titles, including Diablo II: Resurrected, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, and Godfall. 

The studio says it is now focused on &quot;multiplayer-first gaming experiences that immerse players in living worlds&quot;.

The claims come from GameSpot , which alleges it has information directly from a private Discord server through which Hasan Kahraman of Blue Box Game Studios, Abandoned&#x27;s director, communicates with a handful of selected fans. 

In exchange for access to &quot;screenshots, animations, and even a page of the game&#x27;s script&quot;, the members are required to sign a NDA, so some would only speak about the project under strict anonymity. Should any member of the server press Kahraman - who is described as &quot;duplicitous and prone to mood swings&quot; - for clarification or more details, they risk being banned from the small community.

                              <span>It looks like pre-orders for Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns are about to go live ahead of an October release date.

That&#x27;s according to a new leak - which the source insists was obtained via an anonymous online retailer - that seemingly backs up prior claims that the game is set to release on 6th October and will be available in three flavours: a standard, enhanced, and legendary edition.

The claims may have flown entirely under the radar, but the images accompanying the leaker&#x27;s tweets - thought to have been box art - have all been zapped with a copyright notice from a senior legal assistant at Take-Two, leading many to believe they are genuine.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s latest season has concluded with this year&#x27;s first big live event, as the battle royale Island&#x27;s heroes aimed to end the villainous Imagined Order faction for good. 


Starting off the event, players found themselves in groups of up to four people inside Fortnite&#x27;s bear mech for the first time. Here, you could peer out from its bridge and onto an unfamiliar landscape - an icy moon which orbits the main Fortnite Island - and play around with gun turrets while listening to brief audio chatter between heroes Jones (Troy Baker), The Origin (Rahul Kohli) and The Foundation (Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson).


With a minute to go, a mission briefing finally re-introduced the mech&#x27;s pilot The Paradigm and laid out the stakes: the evil IO were set to detonate a superweapon capable of killing everyone, and it was up to you inside the mech to stop it. (Never mind that this is your goal in each battle royale match.) So off we went, blasting into space, through an asteroid field, and towards our best view of the Fortnite island floating through the multiverse yet.

The reimagined version of Capcom&#x27;s survival horror classic Resident Evil 4 kicked off yesterday&#x27;s State of Play showcase with an eye-catching trailer, complete with a release date: 24th March 2023.

The reveal teaser also included something else: a disclaimer, stating &quot;Leon&#x27;s brown sheepskin leather bomber jacket appears with permission from Schott NYC&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced it is &quot;no longer targeting a FY23 release&quot; for its troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.
Following rumours that The Sands of Time remake - which has moved release date several times now - was being delisted at some major retailers, Ubisoft released a brief statement confirming the game has formally been &quot;delisted&quot; as the game&#x27;s latest development studio, Ubisoft Montreal &quot;continue[s] the work to deliver a great remake&quot;.

The Sands of Time remake was being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai, but the project has been dogged by setbacks since its unveiling in September 2020. Shortly after its announcement, Ubisoft moved its launch date from January 2021 to March that same year, but February brought a second delay, this time indefinitely, while the team worked on delivering &quot;a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original&quot;.

Last week, Sega hinted it had a big &quot;new project&quot; to share with us this week, teasing that the broadcast would reportedly include appearances from Hiroyuki Miyazaki and Yosuke Okunari. Given the guests, it wasn&#x27;t a stretch to presume the secret new project may have something to do with a new Sega retro console - and it turns out that&#x27;s exactly what Sega was teasing.

As yet, we don&#x27;t have any information on English social media, but the reveal has been posted to Sega Japan&#x27;s official YouTube channel, which you can check out below:

The demo gives players their first taste of gameplay and the unique abilities of the game&#x27;s 10 playable characters, but online team battles are only available during specific hour-long sessions throughout the weekend, with the next being at noon UK time.

The demo&#x27;s available now to download if you have a Nintendo Switch Online Subscription (those without one can sign for a seven-day free trial). Online team battles allow you to team up with friends online to challenge others - with a maximum of four players per team across two consoles - as well as random competitors.

Instead of &quot;participating&quot; in Cologne, Nintendo states that &quot;instead, players will be able to try out the games for Nintendo Switch at numerous events throughout Germany&quot;.

&quot;Gamescom is a key event in Nintendo’s calendar of events,&quot; Nintendo said in a statement to Games Wirtschaft (thanks, VGC). &quot;This year, however, after careful consideration, we have decided against participating in Cologne.

                              <span>EA has finally confirmed that the Werewolf expansion is coming to The Sims 4.

The Sims 4 Werewolves Game Pack - which releases on Steam, Origin, and Xbox on 16th June - brings &quot;unique temperaments and abilities, be affected by the phase of the moon, and experience wolf-specific life events&quot;.

It&#x27;ll be welcomed news for Simmers who may have been disappointed that werewolves were not part of the recent update, despite EA teasing that werewolves might finally be making a return to the series for the first time since The Sims 3&#x27;s Supernatural expansion.

                              <span>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield&#x27;s very Dead-Space-like sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol finally has a release date and is heading to PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC on 2nd December this year.


The Callisto Protocol, which was officially unveiled back in December 2020, is a third-person horror game set in 2320. Its action unfolds within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto, and - needless to say - suffocating terror and &quot;terrifying secrets&quot; ensue.


We&#x27;ve only seen a single cinematic of The Callisto Protocol since its intriguing 2020 reveal, so it&#x27;s nice to finally, properly see the thing in action courtesy of its brand-new release date trailer - which includes a smattering of gameplay - below. It looks like appropriately atmospheric, deliciously icky stuff - and, yes, not entirely dissimilar to Dead Space.

Naoki Yoshida introduced a new trailer for the game at the PlayStation State of Play you can watch below, which gave us a fresh look at the game&#x27;s story and gameplay.


In particular it showcased the game&#x27;s cast of summons, or Eikons as they&#x27;re known, their names chanted in the music if you listen carefully: Phoenix, Titan, Garuda, Ramuh, Shiva, Odin, Bahamut, and Ifrit.

Horizon Call of the Mountain, which was announced back in January, is a first-person experience set the series&#x27; gorgeous, post-apocalypse world. It casts players as a new character -  Ryas, a former Shadow Carja Warrior who hopes to redeem himself by investigating a grave threat to the Sundom - and sets them on an adventure featuring main series protagonist Aloy and a host of other familiar faces.


Call of the Mountain&#x27;s new trailer, revealed during tonight&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, offers a first proper look at the game in action - including some of the activities players will be able to partake in using Sony&#x27;s upgraded VR kit, such as archery and mountain climbing - and it would be an understatement to say it all looks spectacular indeed.

                              <span>PlayStation has 30 minutes of annoucements for you tonight, and you can watch them all right here. 


Sony&#x27;s summer announcement show will include &quot;exciting reveals&quot; from the company&#x27;s third-partner partners, we&#x27;re told, plus a look at several games in development for PlayStation VR2.


Does this rule out an update on God of War, PlayStation&#x27;s next big release? We&#x27;ll have to wait and see. Boy, keep those fingers crossed it&#x27;s still on track for 2022.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is the name of the next game in BioWare&#x27;s fantasy role-playing series.


In a blog post, BioWare touched on the subtitle, which is an alias of Dragon Age: Inquisition party member Solas.

&quot;Solas, the Dread Wolf,&quot; reads the official blurb. &quot;Some say he might be an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people... or a saviour who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world.

                              <span>Researchers have demonstrated controlling touchscreens at a distance, at least in a laboratory setting:
The core idea is to take advantage of the electromagnetic signals to execute basic touch events such as taps and swipes into targeted locations of the touchscreen with the goal of taking over remote control and manipulating the underlying device.
The attack, which works from a distance of up to 40mm, hinges on the fact that capacitive touchscreens are sensitive to EMI, leveraging it to inject electromagnetic signals into transparent electrodes that are built into the touchscreen so as to register them as touch events...</span>

                              <span>Casting for Sony&#x27;s live-action Twisted Metal series continues, with the news that Will Arnett - known for the likes of BoJack Horseman, The Lego Batman Movie, and Arrested Development - will voice the role of insane clown Sweet Tooth.


According to Variety, the show&#x27;s version of the iconic Sweet Tooth is a &quot;hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning. A lover of chaos, this majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses &#x27;Lost Vegas&#x27; as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck.&quot;


The Twisted Metal series - a half-hour action comedy scripted by Cobra Kai writer Michael Jonathan Smith for Peacock - follows a motor-mouthed outsider, played by Anthony Mackie, who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland dominated by savage marauders driving vehicles of destruction.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s brief gameplay tease, Sega has released a considerably more substantial seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay, offering a much clearer look at how the hedgehog&#x27;s first foray into open-world platforming will likely play out.


Yesterday&#x27;s footage was perhaps most notable for the rather muted art style Sega has opted for this time around, with the game - at least from what we&#x27;ve seen so far - placing Sonic in a realistically hewn world that almost feels closer to the sodden, boulder-pocked hillsides of Death Stranding than it does the colour-blasted Sonic backdrops of old.


We get to see a lot more of that expansive landscape in Sega&#x27;s newly shared seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay (thanks IGN), with the bulk of the footage focused on leisurely exploration as Sonic roams around, solving puzzles to unlock new elements in the world.

                              <span>Velan Studios&#x27; competitive &quot;dodgebrawl&quot; game Knockout City has officially gone free-to-play.


Knockout City - which launched on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC last May - was initially published under the EA Originals label, but earlier this year Velan announced it would be taking over publishing duties and shifting to a free-to-play model starting with its sixth season.


Both the free version of Knockout City and Season 6: City of Tomorrow are now here, introducing, among other things, the new Boomerang Ball across all playlists, the Starfruit Special energy drink, the sci-flyer crew vehicle, a permanent new career contract, an expanded hideout area, various map improvements, and more, as detailed in today&#x27;s patch notes.

Saber Interactive&#x27;s Space Marine sequel was announced at last year&#x27;s The Game Awards with a fancy CGI trailer that confirmed the return of Ultramarines hard man Captain Titus, as well as a few GIFs&#x27; worth of gameplay.


The new trailer, below, includes talking heads from Saber discussing their passion for the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Titus actor Clive Standen pottering about in full motion capture get-up, as well as a handful of new blink-and-you&#x27;ll miss them clips.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal - Blizzard&#x27;s free-to-play take on its long-running dungeon crawler series - has started its global roll-out, and is now available to download on iOS and Android devices in certain territories.


First announced at BlizzCon in 2018 - where it was less than warmly received by attendees - Diablo Immortal takes place between the events of Diablo 2 and 3, adapting the classic dungeon crawling formula of its predecessors for mobile devices - which, among other things, means a free-to-play monetisation model based around in-app purchases.


Starting out in the city of Westmarch, players can adopt one of six classes - Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Crusader, Necromancer, or Demon Hunter - and journey out to explore eight areas along with other adventurers. Blizzard and co-developer NetEase have previously said additional zones, storylines, loot, and classes will be added over time.

                              <span>To celebrate Pride Month, Xbox is releasing a brand new controller design that incorporates 34 community flags.


The flags are in &quot;a fine, interwoven manner to celebrate the nuance, complexity, intersectionality, and strength of the many LGBTQIA+ communities&quot;, explains an Xbox Wire post.


Last year, Xbox created a limited number of Pride controllers but many players wanted it to be universally available. This year&#x27;s controller will therefore be customisable in the Xbox Design Lab.

                              <span>On 16th June, those who own either a Nintendo Switch, an Xbox or a PlayStation will be able to get their hands on the formally PC exclusive and BAFTA winning Autonauts. 
For those who don&#x27;t know already, Autonauts is a game where you build and then train robots to automate the world around you. Sounds easy enough, but there is a catch. In short, these robots are only ever going to be as smart as you tell them to be.
It is up to you as the player to teach your bots what do. You will need to upgrade them and expand their brains as the game progresses, opening up their full operational potential. You can build dozens of different workerbots on your planet and make it a &quot;fully functioning home&quot; with their help. By fully functioning home, we are talking cooking, mining, construction, you name it.

Once enabled in the settings, players can access the mode and snap away. The team at Shedworks also have a photography competition planned, as noted in the latest update blog.


That same blog also details a number of other fixes and additions to the game. Most importantly, changes have been made to the camera to reduce motion sickness when riding vehicles.

All episodes of the game were also free this time last year for the same reason. 

While the first episode is free all year round and the whole game is available on Xbox Game Pass, it&#x27;s nice to have the opportunity own the whole game to play on your own time.

                              <span>Nvidia has created a new map within Minecraft powered by RTX technology to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s  Platinum Jubilee. 


Built by artist Ushio Tokura, the map features a full recreation of Buckingham Palace and Pall Mall, along with a street party that includes bunting, cake, champagne and a game of pin the tail on the corgi (I hope they got permission from the council). 


The map took three designers 650 hours within two weeks to build, 45m blocks and covers a virtual area of roughly 830,000 square feet.

Speaking of the game&#x27;s world, this will be the first Pokémon role-playing game where you can freely explore the entire map from the off - and &quot;not in an order dictated by the story&quot;, as The Pokémon Company clarified today. 


&quot;Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet allow multiplayer gameplay with up to four players,&quot; The Pokémon Company said. &quot;Along with series staples, such as trading and battling Pokémon, you will be able to explore the various locations of the region in these games with other players. You can discover new Pokémon and explore unfamiliar areas with your friends and family, opening the door to an adventure more precious and fun than ever!&quot;

Today, however, Chucklefish released a handful of new screenshots showing more of Witchbrook in action - and still in development. First off, above, we have a literal witch and a brook. And ducks. 


Below, there&#x27;s a glimpse at the game&#x27;s garden area and greenhouse. Is this where herbology is taught? We can also see a variety of character models showing young witches and wizards from different backgrounds. Also a sleeping cat.

&quot;Bring order to your correctional facility and manage its Boiling Point, reforming gang members and protecting inmates and staff,&quot; announced Paradox Interactive and Double Eleven today. &quot;Show gangs who&#x27;s boss by enforcing a strict code of conduct among your inmates, and turn gang members into valuable members of society.&quot;
So, that all sounds very exciting, but what is this Boiling Point you speak of, Victoria? Well, I am so glad you asked.

Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins will unite players with the titular Frogger as he learns about the lost treasure of an ancient frog tribe (why are they ancient - your guess is as good as mine, but I&#x27;d say... maybe they croaked?). 
However, this is not all. Along with the promise of hidden riches, something else strange is going on, as &quot;an alarming number of froglets are disappearing around the world&quot;. You can check out the new trailer for Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins below.

Consumer protection agencies in 18 European countries have backed the report and called for better regulation of video games. 


The report uses both FIFA 22 and Raid: Shadow Legends as case studies to demonstrate the &quot;wide arsenal of tricks to push consumers into spending as much time and money as possible exploiting consumers hope to receive the reward despite a miniscule chance and likelihood to do so&quot;.

The incident publicly came to light as part of California&#x27;s still-ongoing lawsuit against Activision, filed last July,  which has alleged multiple instances of discrimination and misconduct at the company.

In addition, Tate Mode will allow players to rotate the handheld for vertical play - the screen has been designed for this and the console includes extra buttons to accommodate the change in orientation.

                              <span>A skilled forger has been discovered after years of selling retro games and memorabilia to unsuspecting collectors. 
The Big Box PC Game Collectors group has ousted Enrico Ricciardi after several members came forward with counterfeit copies of classic games which they had purchased from Ricciardi. 
The group has now shared a public document (via Kotaku) detailing its investigation and subsequent evidence against Ricciardi. This document states: &quot;If you have received games from [Ricciardi], check them closely and compare with known originals. I advise to presume they are fake, because our investigation has unearthed quite a bit more alleged forgeries than real.&quot;

                              <span>Respawn boss Vince Zampella and The Sims exec Lyndsay Pearson have issued statements supporting the rights of women and transgender people, as EA continues to be pressured by employees to make a wider statement of its own. 


The remarks, posted publicly on Twitter overnight, reportedly follow an internal meeting within EA on LGBTQ+ issues, Kotaku reported. 


There, the publisher was again asked by employees whether it would make a public statement on these issues - and reportedly again kept to its previous line that these topics were subject to different points of view across the company.

For those of you out of the loop, I highly recommend you give Digital Foundry&#x27;s explainer a read, where Alex Battaglia explains it much more eloquently than I ever could. 


In short, FSR 2.0 is a suite of image upscaling technologies which let your PC run the game at a lower internal resolution, which is then reconstructed to be close to indistinguishable from its native resolution.

Having joined Squaresoft (as it was known)in 1995, Hashimoto later became the brand manager for the Final Fantasy series and co-creator of Kingdom Hearts.


He shared a message of his retirement on his Twitter, as well as a video message on the Square Enix account where he explained his love for meeting fans at events, something he&#x27;s sadly been unable to do due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Konami did not go into the specifics of why it has made this decision, only citing &quot;various circumstances&quot; as the catalyst for the service&#x27;s closure.

This should save quite a bit of time for completionists, who will no longer have to resort to Google in order to find the one pesky achievement that haunts your nightmares.


To find the hidden details, just open the Xbox Guide from within a game and go to Game Activity and then Achievements. After that, you just need to find the achievement you&#x27;re after and manually select to unhide it.

Author: Paris Pittman (Steering Committee)
Last year, we published our first Annual Report Summary for 2020 and it&#x27;s already time for our second edition!
2021 Annual Report Summary
This summary reflects the work that has been done in 2021 and the initiatives on deck for the rest of 2022. Please forward to organizations and indidviduals participating in upstream activities, planning cloud native strategies, and/or those looking to help out. To find a specific community group&#x27;s complete report, go to the kubernetes/community repo under the groups folder. Example: sig-api-machinery/annual-report-2021.md
You’ll see that this report summary is a growth area in itself. It takes us roughly 6 months to prepare and execute, which isn’t helpful or valuable to anyone as a fast moving project with short and long term needs. How can we make this better? Provide your feedback here: https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/242

                              <span>Yu Suzuki - the legendary designer behind the likes of Sega classics Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, OutRun, and Space Harrier - has unveiled new 3D shooter Air Twister, which is making its way to Apple Arcade on 24th June.


Air Twister is a fantasy &quot;swipe&quot; shooter - developed by Shenmue 3 studio YS Net - that asks players, in the role of Princess Arch, to battle alien invaders and save their planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


As the trailer reveals, there&#x27;s a definite Space Harrier vibe to the whole thing - with a touch of Panzer Dragoon thrown in when our lead takes to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and, according to an interview attended by GameSpot, Air Twister is based on a fantasy shooting game Yu Suzuki envisaged in the 80s, before he adapted the idea into Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

                              <span>Ofcom has published its annual report into the UK&#x27;s online habits - including plenty of stats for how many of us are now playing online games, paying for subscriptions, and trying to beat Wordle. 


39 percent of UK adults aged 16 or over play games online, Ofcom says, with 56 percent of children aged three to 15 playing games online. The average time spent each week playing games online was 7 hours and 33 minutes, including PC, console, VR and smartphone gaming.


These figures come from Ofcom surveys completed in late 2021, so after formal lockdowns had ended, Ofcom noted. In general, there was a dip in the amount of time younger people played online games year-on-year, though a growth in time spent playing online games for those aged 55-64.

                              <span>Adeline Software&#x27;s much-loved Little Big Adventure series can now be enjoyed with a welcome selection of modern day niceties - including cloud saves, controller support, and Steam achievements - thanks to a brand-new update on Steam.


The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. Needless to say, at now over a quarter of a century old, both were decidedly lacking in modern day polish.


Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to the series (and counts Little Big Adventure co-creator Didier Chanfray as a founder), announced it would be upgrading Little Big Adventure 1 &amp; 2 back in March, although there was no estimated time of arrival for its enhancements.

                              <span>Almost exactly one year after Sonic Frontiers&#x27; initial tease, Sega has returned with a new brand-new trailer offering our first, brief look at some gameplay for the hedgehog&#x27;s latest adventure.


Sonic Frontiers was first teased at the end of last May (with only the vaguest of CGI trailers and no name), but it wasn&#x27;t until December that first proper details emerged, with Sega describing the title as Sonic&#x27;s &quot;first ever open zone&quot; game.


&quot;Accelerate to new heights and experience the thrill of high velocity open-zone freedom,&quot; the publisher said at the time. &quot;Battle powerful enemies as you speed through the Starfall Islands - landscapes brimming with dense forests, overflowing waterfalls, sizzling deserts and more!&quot;.

                              <span>Get ready earthlings, Crypto is back (no, not that planet burning kind). THQ Nordic has revealed that Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is heading our way on 30th August, with alien invader Crypto - or to be more precise, the next Crypto: Cryptosporidium 138 - leading the charge (ok, so maybe &quot;that planet burning kind&quot; is actually still accurate...).
THQ has promised this release will be a faithful remake of 2006&#x27;s alien filled caper, complete with &quot;five huge open-world areas&quot;. These areas are Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and, what with this being a game with an out of this world entity roaming through its maps, the Moon. 
But, who exactly will players come across within these vast maps? Well, as Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is set in the swinging &#x27;60s, you will have to deal with more than a small handful of hippies on your quest for glory. Oh, yes, and there is also the small matter of the KGB as well. You can check out the latest trailer for Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed below.

&quot;On the 24th of February 2022, our Heart of Russia team was some six to eight weeks away from completing work on the highly anticipated new DLC. We all felt really good about the result; a lot of effort had been invested in making this new region look truly fantastic in the game,&quot; SCS shared in a blog post yesterday.
&quot;We were absolutely sure that our community, especially those in Russia, would really appreciate that. Then, all of a sudden, the entire world was rocked by the news that Ukraine had been invaded by Russia.&quot;

But since its worldwide release, the game&#x27;s deep links to cryptocurrency and upcoming plans for NFTs have come under the spotlight (thanks, Kotaku).


Players can earn Territe, a currency which can then be exchanged for &quot;Territe Tokens&quot;, in game from monster battling, completing various daily missions and other grinding mechanics.

OK, well it sort of has. This new crossover actually adds customisations from 19 of Tekken 7&#x27;s characters for Virtua Fighter 5&#x27;s existing cast, so we are talking new costumes rather than any new moves. Either way though, it looks set to be a lot of chaotic fun.
You can check out the new trailer for the latest crossover below.

The video, posted to YouTube by Foulowe59, shows a montage of gameplay footage apparently filmed on Nintendo&#x27;s showfloor booth at E3 2005. 


It was there that the game was shown off in a demo reel, as part of various upcoming GameCube and Nintendo DS titles. Alas, as we now know, this Kirby never made it much further.

                              <span>French government officials are banning a number of anglicised gamer words to preserve the purity of the language.


The culture ministry has said the video game sector is rife with English words that could be &quot;a barrier to understanding&quot; for non-gamers, writes The Guardian.



That means that pro gamer becomes &quot;joueur professionnel&quot;, and streamer becomes &quot;joueur-animateur en direct&quot;.

                              <span>June&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation Plus titles have now leaked.
Coming from reliable source Deallabs, the PlayStation Plus games for June are reportedly  God of War (2018), Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. These games will be available from 7th June until 5th July.
Some have seen the inclusion of God of War as a hint that Sony may be looking to up the marketing for its sequel, God of War: Ragnarök. After all, the game is still slated to release some time this year, and that 2022 window is rapidly getting smaller and smaller (I for one can&#x27;t believe we are nearly in June already!).

                              <span>Interesting paper by Lennart Maschmeyer: “The Subversive Trilemma: Why Cyber Operations Fall Short of Expectations“:
Abstract: Although cyber conflict has existed for thirty years, the strategic utility of cyber operations remains unclear. Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict...</span>

SHB is a small, annual, invitational workshop of people studying various aspects of the human side of security, organized each year by Alessandro Acquisti, Ross Anderson, Alice Hutchings, and myself. The forty or so attendees include psychologists, economists, computer security researchers, sociologists, political scientists, criminologists, neuroscientists, designers, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, geographers, business school professors, and a smattering of others.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re watching the new Obi-Wan Kenobi series and want yet more backstory, it sounds like you could do a lot worse than read this month&#x27;s latest Star Wars novel, Brotherhood.


Brotherhood takes place during the Clone Wars, and stars both Anakin Skywalker and Kenobi off on another adventure. But it&#x27;s the novel&#x27;s cameos which have sparked some extra attention - seeing as they acknowlege a couple of well-known video games (thanks, GamesRadar). 


For starters, Brotherhood apparently includes a &quot;blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it&quot; appearance by Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order star Cal Kestis, who was but a youngling at the time of the novel&#x27;s events.

An Activision Blizzard Benelux communications manager confirmed  the move to Dutch news site Tweakers, GamesIndustry.biz has reported, and cited &quot;the current operating conditions in these countries&quot;. Eurogamer has contacted Activision Blizzard here in the UK for comment. 


Pre-registration for the game&#x27;s mobile launch and PC beta has also now been withdrawn in both countries, it&#x27;s been claimed.

Now, one modder has gone further still, and added another handy little rune to Link&#x27;s Sheikah Slate.
The mod in question comes from sofiaharley and is dubbed the Flying Rune, or Cyclos. It basically acts like an overpowered version of Revali&#x27;s Gale, generating a wind current every time a player presses the rune button. 
&quot;Think of it like flapping your wings,&quot; explains sofiaharley. &quot;One little flap will only bring you up a little bit, but if you keep flapping you can go as high as you like!&quot;

                              <span>Fighting game fans are puzzled as to why SoulCalibur 2 HD - still available to play via Xbox 360 backwards compatibility - has become unavailable to buy on Xbox via the Microsoft Store. 


The removal was spotted over the weekend by Jon Cartwright and appears to be recent (thanks, VG247). SoulCalibur for the OG Xbox has also been delisted, it was noted, although this seems to have happened some time ago. 

SoulCalibur 2 HD now shows a &quot;not available separately&quot; message when attempting to buy the game via the Microsoft Store&#x27;s website - though it does not appear to be available elsewhere as part of any bundle - and &quot;not available at this time&quot; via Xbox consoles.

                              <span>A new fan made trailer imagines what Rare&#x27;s unreleased Banjo-Threeie could have been on the Nintendo 64 (but with vastly-improved graphics).
The trailer by Project Dream (spotted by TheGamer), proudly proclaims &quot;the adventure continues!&quot;
 This fan made threequel is set 22 years after the events of Banjo-Tooie and the defeat of Gruntilda. And, for a pretty decent period of time, everything seemed to be calm and collected for our heroes.

                              <span>Nintendo is shutting down the Pokémon DP sound library, mere months after it became available.

The sound library comprises music and sound effects from the 2006 DS games Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, launched back in February.


However, an announcement on the library page states it will shut down on 31st May. No data will be available to stream or download after this date.

                              <span>Microsoft has said it is unlikely to restore the Xbox&#x27;s &quot;Snap&quot; ability in a future update.


That&#x27;s according to Xbox engineering lead Eden Marie, who noted on Twitter that: &quot;While we all miss snap, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coming back.&quot;


Snap was a key feature - and one of the few selling points - of the Xbox One at its launch. The handy ability let you stick an app to one side of your screen while continuing to play games alongside.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has seen a record financial year, according to industry analyst Dr. Serkan Toto.



A filing in the Japanese government&#x27;s official gazette shows sales were up over 70 percent from the previous year to 204bn yen (US$1.6bn), while operating profit was at 59 billion yen (US$460m) and net profit rose 123 percent to 41bn yen (US$320m).




Of course, that&#x27;s down to some huge game releases over the fiscal year, including Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Pokémon Unite and New Pokémon Snap.

                              <span>Among the various announcements revealed this weekend as part of Star Wars Celebration, we got news of a Lego BD-1 from Respawn&#x27;s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (arguably the best thing about the game) headed our way.
The new model, which is set to release on 1st August, will have 1062 pieces, and on completion will stand at 31cm. And he won&#x27;t just be a static companion to add to your collection. Rather, he will have a head that can be &quot;tilted back, forward and sideways for maximum cuteness&quot;.
As well as the ability to pose BD-1, those who purchase their own little droid companion this summer will also get to experience other neat little inclusions, such as the back of BD-1&#x27;s head being translucent to show the droid&#x27;s mood and a display sign (see below). He probably won&#x27;t be able to heal you like he does for Cal, however.

                              <span>Artwork for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - yes, the new one - has popped up on Steam.

The discovery has fans speculating - and hoping - that this may mean that, after a seven year absence, Activision is moving away from battle.net exclusivity on PC and bringing its first-person shooter back to Valve&#x27;s PC client, Steam.

As spotted by u/Kalinine and posted to Reddit, the Modern Warfare 2 Ghost artwork &quot;show[ed] up on Steam&quot;. When pushed for clarification, the user added: &quot;it shows up at the bottom of the DLC page for some Call of duty games like Black Ops 3&quot;.

Ramiro Galan - a principal designer at Pixelkings - shared a handful of never-before-seen images on their digital portfolio, showing off what appears to be the cancelled game&#x27;s character creation screen. 

&quot;Here is a series of styles and screens by Ramiro Galan for a cancelled Marvel MMO title,&quot; the album&#x27;s description tells us. &quot;Emphasis was on rich and vibrant colours with stylistic tones that pay homage to Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse. All design, 3D materials, lighting, and post process FX were done by Ramiro Galan.&quot;

                              <span>A dataminer has uncovered further references to Ruby and her Demon Spawn secreted within Evil Dead: The Game&#x27;s files.

Ruby - who hails from Ash vs. Evil Dead - has yet to make an appearance in the main game, and her absence from the roster was a surprising omission to some given the plethora of other characters from Evil Dead stories, both old and new.

Now - thanks to a second batch of datamined voice files from our hero roster - it seems like she will indeed be making an appearance, seemingly batting for the Demons in these particular scenarios, although it&#x27;s not totally beyond the realm of possibility that she may turn up as a survivor, too - hopefully we&#x27;ll get an official reveal soon.

While newly launched, the project has already successfully archived 50,000 &quot;games, consoles, and accessories&quot; at its hub in Karlstad, Sweden, and employs a CEO, archive assistant, technical engineer, and supply manager.

                              <span>The Russian version of Gotham Knights has allegedly been cancelled.

That&#x27;s according to The Happy Warrior, which says sources at Warner Bros. Montreal have confirmed the publisher has cancelled the Russian version &quot;due to the political fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine&quot;.

The rumour is further compounded by confirmation that Gotham Knight&#x27;s Russian sub-site has been taken offline; the URL now results in a 404 error (it was still live as at 12th May, according to archive.org). Similarly, the Steam page makes no mention of Russian-language support, hinting that both Russian voicework and subtitles have been removed (thanks, VGC).

The letter - allegedly from PUBG developer Krafton - also wanted copies of PlayerIGN&#x27;s direct messages in order to decipher &quot;how [they] got said information&quot;.

Arenas come as part of the MMO&#x27;s latest update, which also ushers in expedition mutators, a Varangian Knights quest chain - where you can &quot;continue the story of the Varangian Knights and their conquest for power&quot; - a PvP rewards track, and &quot;a whole host of other updates&quot;.

&quot;Step into the Arena to test your skills against other combatants!&quot; Amazon explains in the game&#x27;s latest blog post. &quot;3v3 Arenas are a new small-scale PvP game mode where teams of three can face off for fame, glory, and riches. You might even win a few unique housing items.&quot;
