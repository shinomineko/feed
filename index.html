                    <span>Developer Asobo&#x27;s spectacular Microsoft Flight Simulator has now received its massive Game of the Year update, introducing a heap of free additions alongside its first major paid expansion, the competitive-multiplayer-focussed Reno Air Races.
Starting with the free additions, Flight Simulator&#x27;s 1.21.12.0 update introduces a total of five new aircraft, some very different to those seen in the base game. The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, for instance, is Asobo&#x27;s first military jet, while the VoloCity is its first eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, capable of pinpoint landings and described as a taster for the proper arrival of helicopters in Flight Simulator next year.

                    <span>Halo Infinite campaign co-op won&#x27;t be released until May 2022 at the earliest - half a year after the game launches.
Speaking to Eurogamer in a new interview, Joseph Staten, Head of Creative at 343 Industries, said the recent extension of Halo Infinite Season 1 to May 2022 means the releases of campaign co-op and Forge mode have also been pushed back from their initial announced target launch windows.

                    <span>Rowhammer is an attack technique involving accessing — that’s “hammering” — rows of bits in memory, millions of times per second, with the intent of causing bits in neighboring rows to flip. This is a side-channel attack, and the result can be all sorts of mayhem.
Well, there is a new enhancement:
All previous Rowhammer attacks have hammered rows with uniform patterns, such as single-sided, double-sided, or n-sided. In all three cases, these “aggressor” rows — meaning those that cause bitflips in nearby “victim” rows — are accessed the same number of times. ...</span>

                    <span>Cult classic platform star Earthworm Jim, first seen on Super Nintendo and Mega Drive back in the early 90s, is returning to television in a brand-new animated series.
As those of a certain age may recall, Earthworm Jim&#x27;s early video game success saw the space-faring invertebrate make the jump to television once before, way back in the mists of 1995 with an animated TV show that ran for two seasons and 23 episodes.

                    <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has written to staff saying he is &quot;evaluating all aspects&quot; of Xbox&#x27;s relationship with Activision Blizzard in light of a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming Activision CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.
In an email seen by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier - and later confirmed by Microsoft in a statement to IGN - Spencer told Xbox employees he and the gaming leadership team were &quot;disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions&quot; at Activision Blizzard, and that &quot;this type of behaviour has no place in our industry&quot;.

                    <span>Ninja Theory&#x27;s acclaimed 2017 action-adventure, Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice, has just received a new update, bringing August&#x27;s Xbox Series X enhancements over to PC. Additionally, a range of new accessibility features have been introduced to both versions.
The official description for Hellblade&#x27;s PC enhancements is a little vague, with Ninja Theory only promising &quot;enriched visuals&quot;, alongside DirectX Raytracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and AMD FSR support. However, the new PC release will almost certainly reflect the Xbox Series X version, which introduced the likes of upgraded materials, particles, and draw distances.

                    <span>Sifu, the striking martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, will be making its way to PlayStation and PC a little sooner than expected. Its arrival date has been revised to 8th February, a few weeks earlier than its originally anticipated 22nd February release.
Announcing the revised launch, Absolver explained it wanted to get Sifu into players hands a little sooner so they &quot;can enjoy playing [it] ahead of an incredibly big month for highly anticipated AAA releases&quot;. If Sifu had stuck to its original release date it would have been jostling up against the likes of Destiny 2&#x27;s The Witch Queen expansion, Horizon: Forbidden West, and the mighty Elden Ring.

                    <span>Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy, a surprisingly competent game for many, just got a heap of improvements with the latest update from Eidos-Montréal. 
Most notably, the update brings a ray-tracing mode to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and a hidden save rollback feature  to allow users who have encountered blocking issues to rollback to the start of the chapter of their choice (here&#x27;s how you can do it).

                    <span>Developer Mojang has announced that the long-awaited second part of Minecraft&#x27;s ambitious Caves &amp; Cliffs update will finally launch on 30th November for the Java and Bedrock editions of the game - meaning it&#x27;ll be coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4,  Switch, iOS, Android, Windows 10, Windows 11, MacOS, and Linux.
Minecraft&#x27;s Caves &amp; Cliffs update, you may recall, was initially unveiled during last October&#x27;s Minecon, with Mojang promising the likes of new cave types - complete with fresh blocks, mobs, and items - underground lakes and waterfalls to raft down, a new archaeology system, and, above ground, significantly more mountainous cliffs, complete with goats.

According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Ryan shared the email earlier today following the recent report by the Wall Street Journal which claimed Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.

Inspired by Steve Purcell&#x27;s cult comic series and first released in 2007, Beyond Time and Space once against follows the largely ludicrous adventures of crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam &amp; Max - who both made their video game debut 15 years earlier in LucasArts&#x27; point-and-click classic Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road - over the course of five episodes.

Eligible users should look for the cloud icon on supported titles in their console&#x27;s Game Pass catalogue. If present, a cloud version of the game can be launched for immediate play - perhaps to sample its wares or to quickly join a friend&#x27;s gaming session - without needing to download it first. Microsoft calls it a &quot;great way to discover your next favourite game while saving space on your hard drive for the games you plan to play again and again.&quot;

                    <span>AWS offers its usual re:Invent justification letter to get your boss to let you attend re:Invent. As per my annual re:Quinnvent tradition, I’ve modified it slightly and sent it to my business partner: Dearest Mike Julian, I’d like your blessing and permission to attend AWS re:Invent 2021, Nov. 29 – Dec. 3 in Las Vegas.

                    <span>I received email from two people who told me that Microsoft Edge enabled synching without warning or consent, which means that Microsoft sucked up all of their bookmarks. Of course they can turn synching off, but it’s too late.
Has this happened to anyone else, or was this user error of some sort? If this is real, can some reporter write about it?
(Not that “user error” is a good justification. Any system where making a simple mistake means that you’ve forever lost your privacy isn’t a good one. We see this same situation with sharing contact lists with apps on smartphones. Apps will repeatedly ask, and only need you to accidentally click “okay” once.)...</span>

Back in October, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester admitted the publisher had almost scrapped Bloodlines 2 completely after its incredibly troubled development, which has seen the project hit with multiple delays and other controversies since its announcement back in 2019 - a sequence of events that ultimately lead to original developer Hardsuit Labs being removed from the project earlier this year.

                    <span>Battlefield is used to a bit of chaos - it&#x27;s at the series&#x27; core, after all, with manic moments in its sandbox what makes it stand out from other shooters - but the disarray of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s first weekend in the wilds has been hugely frustrating. Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I&#x27;ve endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable. This is another Battlefield that&#x27;s launching in a sorry state, and it&#x27;s up there with Battlefield 4&#x27;s infamously sorry start. From my own experience on Xbox Series X, it&#x27;s considerably worse. 
A lot of that frustration stems from setting aside Friday night to get stuck into DICE&#x27;s new shooter only to spend the whole evening butting up against a data persistent error that was, shall we say, persistent - across a whole night it was impossible to get into a single match of the All-Out Warfare that&#x27;s the core of this new Battlefield experience, and only the classic matches and rulesets of Portal offered any joy.

In the same breath, Rockstar removed the ability to buy the PC version of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition from its website.

Last year we announced that Dockershim is being deprecated: Dockershim Deprecation FAQ.
Our current plan is to remove dockershim from the Kubernetes codebase soon.
We are looking for feedback from you whether you are ready for dockershim
removal and to ensure that you are ready when the time comes.
Please fill out this survey: https://forms.gle/svCJmhvTv78jGdSx8.
The dockershim component that enables Docker as a Kubernetes container runtime is
being deprecated in favor of runtimes that directly use the Container Runtime Interface

                    <span>The New War, free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe&#x27;s highly anticipated new story expansion will launch simultaneously on all platforms this December, Digital Extremes has announced.
Unveiled during this year&#x27;s TennoCon fan event (but teased back in 2018), The New War is described as Warfare&#x27;s &quot;biggest narrative expansion...so far&quot;, telling the story of a massive Sentient invasion from the perspective of multiple playable characters - including a Grineer Lancer called Kahl-175, Corpus engineer Veso, and Conclave Master Teshin. Digital Extremes has previously called The New War, the &quot;most ambitious thing we&#x27;ve done&quot;.

The new locations popped up early last week, and come from the wider database of approved locations used by developer Niantic&#x27;s earlier game Ingress. (Pokémon Go has specific rules to limit the number of locations which filter through to it, to space out places on its map.)

It was fab and much-missed, and if a new report is to be believed, is now &quot;definitely&quot; set to make a a comeback.
That&#x27;s according to journalist (and reliable rumour-smith) Jeff Grubb, who discussed a new in-development take on 1 vs 100 as part of his Giant Bomb show. As reported by VGC, Grubb claimed the new project will be developed by Altspace VR - part of Microsoft&#x27;s Mixed Reality division - and will utilise the 3D avatars recently revealed for Microsoft Teams.

The sites served both iOS and MacOS exploit chains, but the researchers were only able to retrieve the MacOS one.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but Spider-Man is finally set to make his Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; debut - exclusively on PlayStation consoles, of course - at the end of this month, and developer Crystal Dynamics has offered a first proper look at the beleaguered live service game&#x27;s take on the character in a new cinematic trailer.
Spider-Man, who arrives somewhat later than his initially announced &quot;early&quot; 2021 release date, will make his Marvel&#x27;s Avenger&#x27;s debut alongside a new hero event, titled With Great Power, which sees Spidey joining forces with Black Widow and Ms. Marvel to try to stop a nefarious new AIM plan.

Make It Count adds new boss Maxim Zelnick, known as the Mob&#x27;s Fixer, to the existing 14-strong roster, alongside a range of other gameplay additions. Loan Sharks are in as a new racket type, for instance, providing a potentially lucrative new passive source of income - and potential new event-based complications if customers can&#x27;t afford afford to repay loans.

                    <span>Exo One - which we&#x27;ve had our eye on now for almost five years - will finally launch next week for PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 18th November. 
A vast and beautiful sci-fi exploration game, Exo One is the work of developer Jay Weston. You control a mysterious gleaming spacecraft that can be rolled around planets like a sci-fi Wii Sports Golf ball, or soar through the air like a flying saucer.

                    <span>YouTube has announced plans to hide the dislike count for videos, and is now slowly rolling out the change across its platform. 
A dislike button will still be shown to all, and a channel owner will still be able to privately view the number of dislikes on a particular video. The only change is that the count will no longer be public.

                    <span>Sony has reportedly reduced its production forecast for the PlayStation 5 again because of &quot;component and logistics constraints&quot;.
Sony had previously targeted more than 16m units assembled in the year ending March, but that has now been cut to 15m units, according to Bloomberg sources. This will make its target of 14.8m PS5 sales by March more difficult.

                    <span>Some cheats have been removed from the GTA&#x27;s remastered trilogy due to technical reasons.
Back in the day, players had plenty of fun with cheat codes in the original games, from adding infinite health, to netting a bank load of cash, and even tanks falling from the skies.

&quot;You know, it&#x27;s great to have celebrities, it&#x27;s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,&quot; Keighley said. &quot;What we really learned last year was at the end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.&quot;

                    <span>After months of rumours, the world of Naruto has now been officially confirmed as coming to Fortnite.
The enormously-popular anime has long been top of fans&#x27; wishlists for characters to include in Epic&#x27;s battle royale. Earlier this year, rumours persisted that Epic was attempting to negotiate the rights - and that at one point Mr. Naruto himself was part of a seasonal battle pass.

                    <span>Image &amp; Form is returning to its critically acclaimed SteamWorld universe with SteamWorld Headhunter, a brand-new new co-operative action-adventure that sees the series moving into 3D for the very first time. But that&#x27;s not all! The developer has also announced a release date for its gloopy third-person sci-fi adventure, The Gunk, which will be heading to Xbox One, Xbox One Series X/S, and PC on 16th December.
SteamWorld Headhunter, to deal with the newcomer first, is the sixth entry in Image &amp; Form&#x27;s celebrated SteamWorld series - following on from SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Heist, SteamWorld Dig 2, and SteamWorld Quest - and once again looks to offer a radical shake-up for the series.

                    <span>Valve has announced a delay for Steam Deck; the portable gaming PC will no longer begin shipping at the end of this year as intially planned, and will now start making its way to customers in February 2022.
Those that successfully managed to surmount some early technical hitches and join the front of the queue when Steam Deck reservations opened back in July were originally due to receive their hardware in December this year. Unfortunately, those Christmases will now be just a little less merry thanks to disruptions in production caused by a lack of available parts.

All three GTA titles included in the remaster bundle have, of course, been impacted by music licensing issues in the past, leading to a number of tracks being omitted when the games were later re-released for iOS and Android, PS3 and PS4, and PC.

The two exploits are particularly notable due to the level of access they theoretically give to the PS5’s software. Decrypted firmware ­ which is possible through Fail0verflow’s keys ­ would potentially allow for hackers to further reverse engineer the PS5 software and potentially develop the sorts of hacks that allowed for things like installing Linux, emulators, or even pirated games on ...</span>

The user/group ID related security settings in Pod&#x27;s securityContext trigger a problem when users want to
deploy containers that use accelerator devices (via Kubernetes Device Plugins) on Linux. In this blog
post I talk about the problem and describe the work done so far to address it. It&#x27;s not meant to be a long story about getting the k/k issue fixed.
Instead, this post aims to raise awareness of the issue and to highlight important device use-cases too. This is needed as Kubernetes works on new related features such as support for user namespaces.
Why non-root containers can&#x27;t use devices and why it matters
One of the key security principles for running containers in Kubernetes is the
principle of least privilege. The Pod/container securityContext specifies …</span>

                    <span>As one of Bethesda&#x27;s biggest and most beloved series, it&#x27;s not much of a revelation to hear the company is already mulling over a new Fallout instalment, but studio director Todd Howard has now talked a little about a potential new series entry, confirming that while an idea exists, Fallout 5 is still a long way off.
Speaking to IGN as part of a Skyrim 10th anniversary retrospective, Howard explained that currently the studio has a &quot;one-pager&quot; for Fallout 5, outlining what it wants to do with the series. However, sci-fi adventure Starfield, due to release next year, and The Elder Scrolls 6 - which was still in its design phase as of June this year - remain the studio&#x27;s priority, meaning it could be years before work on the next Fallout begins in earnest.

The 2021 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 4 of which were up for election in 2021. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.
This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Results
Congratulations to the elected committee members whose two year terms begin immediately (listed in alphabetical order by GitHub handle):

                    <span>Developer Turtle Rock has released a fresh post-launch content roadmap for its well-received co-op zombie shooter Back 4 Blood, promising a host of new features into 2022, including a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression before this year is through.
Back 4 Blood, you might recall, came in for criticism on release when players discovered its unwavering always-online requirements, even when playing solo with AI teammates. Worse, restrictions to solo mode meant players wishing to go it alone were prevented from earning progress towards Accomplishments, earning Supply Points, and even tracking stats. Following player feedback, Turtle Rock wrote, &quot;We have heard your frustrations about progression in solo mode and are discussing ways to address the issue&quot;.

                    <span>Pokémon Smile, the augmented reality smartphone app designed to encourage children to brush their teeth, has just received its first ever content update, almost 18 months after its initial launch back in June last year.
Pokémon Smile, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tasks users with rescuing Pokémon from &quot;cavity causing bacteria&quot; - by brushing their actual teeth with an actual brush - all while wearing a special AR hat. Any Pokémon saved from calamity are popped in a Pokédex, and there&#x27;s a photo and sticker element for those really into the whole thing.

                    <span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has finally been given a long-awaited - and desperately needed - shot in the arm, courtesy of Nintendo&#x27;s 2.0 update which, somewhat unexpectedly, arrived earlier today. We already knew it was going to be a big one, of course, but we now have a much clearer idea of just how big it actually is, with data miners having successfully unearthed and catalogued a whopping 9,000+ new items as part of the update.
Granted, a fair few of those items - as datamined by NWPlayer123, Trundler, and VillagerDB, and shared by AnimalCrossingWorld - are colour variations, but even taking those into account, it&#x27;s still a mammoth set of additions, covering clothing items, furniture, a multitude of different light fixtures, cooking apparatus, and more.

The Jinx crossover gets underway today, and - as is now very much the norm in the ever-revolving advertising billboard that is Fortnite&#x27;s Metaversal world - will take the form of a purchasable skin in the shooter&#x27;s Item Shop.

                    <span>Almost exactly 15 months after it was revealed Spider-Man would be heading to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive playable character, developer Crystal Dynamics has announced a release date for the much-delayed hero; he&#x27;ll be swinging into action on 30th November as part of a relatively beefy update for the beleaguered live service game.
Spider-Man was originally due to arrive &quot;early&quot; 2021, but players began to wonder if something was seriously amiss when the character, having failed to materialise in that initial launch window, was conspicuously absent from a development roadmap stretching all the way into &quot;summer and beyond&quot;. Crystal Dynamics eventually moved to reassure fans that Spidey was still coming but his exact arrival date remained unclear - until now.

Indeed, that figure means Blizzard has overall shed a million active users since May, and three million total since the quarter before that, when it was at 29 million.

                    <span>Jen Oneal, who joined Blizzard as new co-leader back in August, has announced she&#x27;s stepping down from the role and will leave Activision at the end of the year to explore &quot;how I can do more to have games and diversity intersect&quot;.
Oneal, formerly the boss of Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy studio Vicarious Visions, was hired as Blizzard co-leader alongside Mike Ybarra following the departure of Blizzard president J. Allen Brack - who left amid the fallout from the State of California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, discrimination, and a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture at the company.

A Harvard spokesperson said that the university is working to crack down on the fake students and other scammers that have gained access to its site. They also said that the scammers were creating the fake accounts by signing up for online classes and then using the email address that process provided to infiltrate the university’s various blogging platforms...</span>

                    <span>Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics are removing Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; controversial progression boosts from sale today as a &quot;first step in rebuilding [players&#x27;] confidence in us as a team&quot;.
Square faced a furious backlash from Avengers players last month after it began selling XP booster &quot;consumables&quot; in the game&#x27;s real-money store, despite pre-launch promises it would only ever monetise cosmetics.

&quot;As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves,&quot; the publisher explained in its Q3 2021 earning report, &quot;particularly in certain key creative roles, it has become apparent that some of the Blizzard content planned for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential.&quot;

Netflix announced it was &quot;in the early stages&quot; of expanding into games back in July, explaining it would initially focus on titles for mobile devices. Two such games - Stranger Things: 1984 and Stranger Things 3 - were added to its entertainment library in August as part of an early Poland-exclusive test, and  three more - Shooting Hoops, Teeter (Up), and Card Blast - were introduced during a wider test in September.

Awesome Games Done Quick 2022 takes place from 9th-16th January next year and will span more than 170 speedruns, all raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation and covering the usual mix of triple-A titles, smaller-scale indie offerings, retro classics, and oddities.

                    <span>Earlier this year, developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone surprised fans with news that Stardew Valley was making the jump to the tabletop with an official board game adaptation. Unfortunately, the first batch went fast - but those that missed out on the initial run now have a second chance at acquiring the game, with orders re-opening this Wednesday.
Alas, online orders will once again only be available for shipping within the US. However, Barone says he&#x27;s teamed up with number of distributors in the UK, the EU, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand this time around, and that copies will be available directly from local stores in these regions. &quot;It&#x27;s not possible for us to keep track of which stores specifically,&quot; he adds, &quot;so the best way is to contact your local store and ask if they are carrying copies.

                    <span>As the calendar flips from October to November, and you pop that sexy calculator costume back in the cupboard for another year, Sony arrives with a fresh batch of PlayStation Now titles, which this month include Mafia: Definitive Edition, Celeste, and Final Fantasy 9.
Last year&#x27;s Mafia: Definitive Edition is, of course, the fancied up version of Illusion Softworks&#x27; fondly remembered open-world mobster game from 2002. This new version certainly looks the part, reimagining the 1930s city of Lost Heaven for modern hardware, but Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell didn&#x27;t feel the the tweaks to its ageing gameplay were quite so successful.

The Mario maker previously said this week&#x27;s huge 2.0 update for the game would be its last major free release, marking the end of regular new content for the game. But this still left the door open for future paid offerings.

This initiative is designed to develop games &quot;where the key focuses are &#x27;global&#x27;, &#x27;online&#x27;, &#x27;community&#x27; and &#x27;IP utilisation&#x27;&quot;, it said today.

                    <span>Really interesting research demonstrating how to hide vulnerabilities in source code by manipulating how Unicode text is displayed. It’s really clever, and not the sort of attack one would normally think about.
From Ross Anderson’s blog:
We have discovered ways of manipulating the encoding of source code files so that human viewers and compilers see different logic. One particularly pernicious method uses Unicode directionality override characters to display code as an anagram of its true logic. We’ve verified that this attack works against C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python, and suspect that it will work against most other modern languages...</span>

                    <span>Amazon&#x27;s new MMO, New World, has reportedly lost more than half its playerbase just a month after its launch on PC.
Despite hitting an impressive all-time concurrent peak of just shy of a million players on 3rd October, Forbes spotted that the numbers on SteamCharts have taken something of a dip, with its concurrent rate falling around 135,000 players every week since launch.

A report by Kotaku states that Friday, 29th October 2021, was the last operating day for employees in Nintendo&#x27;s Redwood City location, one of three main Nintendo offices for Nintendo of America. Around 100 employees are thought to be affected by the closure in California, although it&#x27;s unclear how many staff at the Canadian office have been forced to relocate or lose their jobs.

                    <span>id Software is currently advertising a dozen job openings at its Texas studio, sparking speculation that a new Quake instalment might be on the way.
Let&#x27;s face it - a development studio advertising for developers isn&#x27;t particularly newsworthy. In this instance, however, Zenimax stated several times that the new hires will be contributing to &quot;the development of a long-running iconic action FPS&quot;, and makes mention of &quot;sci-fi and fantasy environments&quot; - and that&#x27;s the bit that&#x27;s got everyone a little excited.

                    <span>Amy Hennig and Skydance Media are working on a new &quot;narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure&quot; set in the Marvel universe.
Hennig, perhaps best known for her work as head writer and creative director on Naughty Dog&#x27;s first three Uncharted games, joined Skydance back in 2019. Prior to that, she was working on a highly-anticipated Star Wars title in conjunction with Visceral Games - a long-in-development project which was ultimately cancelled by EA.

One year on, the developer is still struggling to right ship - and save face - following the game&#x27;s disastrous launch, and a newly revised roadmap for those remedial efforts has now seen all Cyberpunk 2077 updates and DLC formally pushed into 2022.
While CD Projeckt&#x27;s development roadmap for Cyberpunk 2077 has never been overly fond of specifics, the studio began 2021 by announcing its troubled RPG would receive &quot;multiple updates and improvements&quot; - including free DLC and the game&#x27;s long-awaited enhanced edition for next-gen consoles, throughout this year.

Specifically, Kotick has said he will only accept California&#x27;s legal minimum salary of $62,500, and will not take any other bonuses or compensation. However, it&#x27;s worth remembering the CEO already earned $155m from the company via a bonus awarded earlier this year.

                    <span>Microsoft is reporting that the same attacker that was behind the SolarWinds breach — the Russian SVR, which Microsoft is calling Nobelium — is continuing with similar supply-chain attacks:
Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers. We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers. We began observing this latest campaign in May 2021 and have been notifying impacted partners and customers while also developing new technical assistance and guidance for the reseller community. Since May, we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers that have been targeted by Nobelium. We continue to investigate, but to date we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been compromised. Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful...</span>

                    <span>Intel unveiled its 12th-gen processors today, shedding light on what promises to be the company&#x27;s biggest step forward in on the desktop for years. These are finally 10nm parts - after seven brutal years and multiple 14nm iterations - and they also adopt a radically different hybrid design, with a combination of low-power &#x27;Efficient&#x27; cores and high-power multi-threaded &#x27;Performance&#x27; cores.
The top chip, the Core i9 12900K, includes eight of each type, for 16 cores and 24 threads in total, and promises to offer boosts of up to 30 percent depending on workload. For gaming, Intel is projecting gains of up to 20 percent, again depending on the game - and with the potential for more to come as games are optimised for the unique arrangement. These chips should also multi-task better, with the more efficient E cores taking on background tasks like streaming or virus scans while the P cores handle gaming or content creation. The new CPUs will arrive on November 4th, so we don&#x27;t have long to wait!

Death&#x27;s Door debuted on PC and Xbox earlier this year, immediately garnering acclaim for its richly atmospheric blend of ingenious exploratory puzzling and challenging combat - all wrapped up in a wondrous, melancholy tale of a soul-reaping crow on a quest to fix a devastating mistake in a beautifully bleak world.

                    <span>Superliminal, the acclaimed perspective puzzler from developer Pillow Castle, is introducing an &quot;experimental&quot; battle-royale-style multiplayer mode in a free update on Steam next week.
In its original, single-player-only guise, Superliminal took players on a brain-flexing first-person journey through the SomnaSculpt dream therapy programme, in which the environment - and objects within it - could gain hitherto unseen properties by manipulating perspective.

Final Fantasy 5, which originally released back in 1992, follows the adventures of a wanderer named Bartz and his trusty Chocobo who, as Square puts it in its announcement, &quot;find themselves drawn toward friends that will change their destiny.&quot;

                    <span>Another batch of PlayStation Plus games has leaked online ahead of Sony&#x27;s official reveal - promisingly, from the same source that got it right twice before - with Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning, Knockout City, The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, and First Class Trouble all reportedly coming to the subscription service in November.
News of next month&#x27;s PlayStation Plus games comes via user Billbill-Kun on French forum Dealabs (as spotted by VGC), who accurately leaked the subscription service&#x27;s additions for September and October. As such, it seems reasonably safe to trust in the freshly leaked November line-up too.

The email, written in the style of the game&#x27;s villain El Presidente, is essentially a message meant to goad player character Dani Rojas back into action.

The Operation Motherland update, due out 2nd November, revolves around the new Conquest mode, which is described as an alternative mode to Ghost Recon Breakpoint&#x27;s story mode. Here&#x27;s the setup:

Each console app contains a numbered list of games ordered alphabetically, with gaps for upcoming titles. But some of these gaps are so small it is obvious which game will alphabetically fill the space (thanks, MondoMega).

Since then, updates have largely been limited to re-runs of previous seasons while developer Ubisoft Massive works on delivering the next major release.

                    <span>Supremo scare-&#x27;em-up Phasmophobia is pulling a bunch of spooky new treats out of its ghostbustin&#x27; bag for Halloween, with today&#x27;s massive new Nightmare update adding a haunted campsite map, four new ghosts, weather effects, and more.
Maple Lodge Campsite is Phasmophobia&#x27;s first outdoor map and packs in everything you could possibly hope for in a spooky holiday retreat, including picnic areas, tents, a log cabin, and even a haunted lake. Developer Kinetic Games says the new map features &quot;more unique objects, higher object density and more visual detail&quot;, and that players can expect other maps to receive a similar boost in detail, plus more unique objects, at a later date.

Activision Blizzard moved to pause legal proceedings following a messy tussle between California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), which had launched the original lawsuit against the publisher, and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) - which had previously announced an $18m settlement deal with Activision as part of its own investigation into the company.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard is letting every Battle.net user change their name for free.
The change comes in the wake of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s committment to changing its &quot;frat boy&quot; culture following California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit. Following accusations of sexual harassment against the developer the character is named after, Overwatch&#x27;s fan-favourite cowboy character Jesse McCree has been given a new name and will be known as Cole Cassidy when an update rolls out on Tuesday, 26th October. Consequently, Activision Blizzard is extending the opportunity of a name-change to its players, too.

Though barely a minute long, the new teaser shows off a decidedly less supernatural premise. &quot;You wanna know what it means to be a killer?&quot; an off-camera narrator muses, before we&#x27;re subjected to a raft of bloody images - a syringe, a beating heart, a bloody smear on a tiled wall - and what looks to be an assortment of DIY surgical experiments. Ew.

                    <span>Overwatch&#x27;s fan-favourite cowboy character Jesse McCree finally has a new name after Activision Blizzard committed to changing it in the wake of California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture at the company. Henceforth, Jesse McCree will be known as Cole Cassidy.
McCree is just one of many characters across Blizzard&#x27;s portfolio to have taken his name from a developer at the company. However, back in August, Blizzard announced it would be renaming the cowboy after the real-life Jesse McCree, who had been named in several accounts of the studio&#x27;s toxic work culture, was confirmed to have departed the company amid the fallout from the lawsuit - although no reason for his exit was given.

                    <span>Squid are eating Maine shrimp, causing a collapse of the ecosystem. This seems to be a result of climate change.
Maine’s shrimp fishery has been closed for nearly a decade since the stock’s collapse in 2013. Scientists are now saying a species of squid that came into the Gulf of Maine during a historic ocean heatwave the year before may have been a “major player” in the shrimp’s downturn.
In 2012, the Gulf of Maine experienced some of its warmest temperatures in decades. Within a couple of years, the cold-water-loving northern shrimp had rapidly declined and the fishery, a small but valued source of income for fishermen in the offseason, closed...</span>

LightBasin (aka UNC1945) is an activity cluster that has been consistently targeting the telecommunications sector at a global scale since at least 2016, leveraging custom tools and an in-depth knowledge of telecommunications network architectures.
Recent findings highlight this cluster’s extensive knowledge of telecommunications protocols, including the emulation of these protocols to facilitate command and control (C2) and utilizing scanning/packet-capture tools to retrieve highly specific information from mobile communication infrastructure, such as subscriber information and call metadata.

                    <span>Nvidia has announced a raft of upgrades for its GeForce Now cloud streaming service with a new premium tier offering RTX 3080 class graphics performance, allowing for 1440p120 gameplay across a range of platforms and 4K60 HDR, limited for now to Shield Android TV devices. New latency reductions techniques are also promised, with Nvidia making bold claims about input lag up against competing cloud technologies - and even local devices.
All of this is made possible via brand new class of server blade Nvidia is bringing online, dubbed the &#x27;SuperPod&#x27;. While you&#x27;re not getting to an actual RTX 3080 as such, you are getting equivalent enterprise-class hardware based on the same GA-102 silicon, backed up by an eight-core, 16 thread AMD Threadripper processor working in combination with ultra-fast PCIe Gen 4.0 solid-state storage and an impressive 28GB of 3200MHz DDR4 memory. This gives the SuperPod top-class graphics performance (only an RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3090 are faster in the Nvidia stack), though CPU performance would fall a little short of the latest Ryzen 5000 and Intel CPUs.

                    <span>Volition&#x27;s first reveal of its upcoming Saints Row reboot did not, it&#x27;s fair to say, seem to bare much in common with the series of old. A few gameplay snippets that followed helped bridge the divide, but a newly revealed look at some early missions has given the clearest indication yet of how Volition is looking to revitalise its ageing sandbox series.
As shared by GameInformer, the new nine-minute pre-alpha gameplay video offers a look at two early story missions: Making Rent and Idol Threat. The first of these takes place before the Saints are even officially formed, with The Boss and the game&#x27;s core supporting - Kevin, Neenah, and Eli, all previously members of rival gangs - orchestrating a robbery on a loan office to raise some cash.

The first time I heard of this issue was from a Midwest CEO. His organization had been hit by ransomware to the tune of $10M. Operationally, they were still recovering nearly a year later. And, embarrassingly, it was his most trusted VP who let the attackers in. It turns out that the VP had approved over 10 different push-based messages for logins that he was not involved in.
