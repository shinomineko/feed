                              <span>Surely no one could have predicted this:
The new proposal—championed by Mayor London Breed after November’s wild weekend of orchestrated burglaries and theft in the San Francisco Bay Area—would authorize the police department to use non-city-owned security cameras and camera networks to live monitor “significant events with public safety concerns” and ongoing felony or misdemeanor violations.
Currently, the police can only request historical footage from private cameras related to specific times and locations, rather than blanket monitoring. Mayor Breed also complained the police can only use real-time feeds in emergencies involving “imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.”...</span>

                              <span>Up until now, The Sims 4 has presented itself as an enthusisatically flexi-sexual world, where every Sim is open to at least considering all attempts to woo and WooHoo. That&#x27;ll soon change, however, with an imminent update giving The Sims 4 players the opportunity to define their Sims&#x27; sexual orientations in a way that better reflects the real world.


Arriving as part of a free update accompanying The Sims 4&#x27;s next major expansion, High School Years, which launches on 28th July, the feature will add a new Sexual Orientation tab to the game&#x27;s Create-A-Sim screen. Here, player will have the opportunity to tinker with three settings that will impact how Sims interact with others in-game.


The first option enables players to choose whether a Sim is romantically attracted to men, women, both, or neither, meaning they&#x27;ll turn down romantic advances made by Sims that don&#x27;t fit that profile. Incidentally, while discussing the feature during its latest livestream, developer Maxis explained it&#x27;s currently using gender binary terms (despite making strides to add more inclusive pronoun options) for technical reasons relating to how The Sims 4, which is built on eight-year-old architecture, currently handles gender behind the scenes. It notes, however, that it hopes to expand the feature to encompass more gender identities over time.

                              <span>A new report has detailed a long-lost title from Totally Games, the developer best remembered for its work on the X-Wing series. Known as Knights of Decayden, it was planned as an early exclusive for the original Xbox before its cancellation and subsequent fade into obscurity.


Totally Games was, of course, a big deal back in the 1990s, having made a name for itself with LucasArts&#x27; hugely popular series of Star Wars space shooters, which included the likes of X-Wing, Tie Fighter, and X-Wing Alliance. Sadly, the studio closed in 2015, following a string of critically and commercially disappointing releases - but fans will likely get a kick out of a new Axios report detailing a fantasy flight combat game the developer was working on in partnership with Microsoft at the height of its success.


Knights of Decayden (other titles reportedly included alternative spelling Knights of Decadyn and Project Archipelago) was initially pitched to Sony under the name Knights of Utu for release on PS2, but eventually found its way under Microsoft&#x27;s wing, with the plan being to release it as an Xbox exclusive in the year following the fledgling console&#x27;s 2001 launch.

Karpyshyn served as lead writer for Mass Effect 1 and 2, though left BioWare part-way through the second game&#x27;s development. 


Discussing the trilogy in a new reddit AMA, Karpyshyn said that when he was in the Mass Effect 2 writers room, BioWare had &quot;some very ideas planned out&quot;.

                              <span>Unity boss and former EA exec John Riccitiello has been slammed for his comments regarding mobile developers who don&#x27;t seek to squeeze monetisation from their smartphone games.


Riccitiello raised eyebrows when discussing developers who don&#x27;t prioritise monetisation as part of their creative process.


&quot;It&#x27;s a very small portion of the gaming industry that works that way,&quot; Riccitiello told PocketGamer.biz, &quot;and some of these people are my favorite people in the world to fight with - they&#x27;re the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people. They&#x27;re also some of the biggest fucking idiots.&quot;

                              <span>Pre-orders are now open for the many different editions of God of War Ragnarök - the most expensive of which, the Jotnar Edition, is priced at £230. This includes lots of fancy physical items and a digital code for the game - but no disc.


As detailed last week, Ragnarök will be available in four separate editions upon launch in November. 


Slightly less expensive, and also without a disc, the God of War Ragnarök Collector&#x27;s Edition costs £180. The Digital Deluxe edition costs £80 - as you might expect from the name, there&#x27;s no disc there either. Finally, a standard digital/disc copy of the game costs £70 on PS5, or £60 on PS4 (where there&#x27;s a £10 upgrade option).

                              <span>Developer Survios is teaming up with 20th Century Fox to create a new single-player, action-horror game based on the Alien franchise.


Details on the new venture - currently being referred to as &quot;Aliens&quot; - are pretty scarce right now, with Survios only saying it&#x27;ll feature an original storyline set somewhere between the events of Alien and Aliens, with players taking on the role of a &quot;battle hardened veteran [with] a vendetta against the Xenomorphs&quot;.


Given Survios&#x27; background as a primarily VR-focused developer - it&#x27;s worked on the likes of Creed: Rise to Glory, The Walking Dead Onslaught, and Puzzle Bobble 3D: Vacation Odyssey - it won&#x27;t be much of a surprise to hear its new Aliens project is also be getting the VR treatment.

                              <span>Fans eagerly awaited fresh news of EA&#x27;s highly-anticipated new Skate game have been given their wish, but it mighn&#x27;t be quite what they were expecting. EA and developer Full Circle have shared a new 18-minute video, announcing, among other things, that their long-awaited skateboarding revival will be a free-to-play live-service game.


Despite having variously been known as both Skate 4 and a Skate reboot since its development was announced in 2020, Full Circle now says the game &quot;isn&#x27;t a sequel, it&#x27;s not a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel.&quot; Instead, it&#x27;s described as an &quot;authentic evolution&quot; of the series - one whose last mainline entry arrived 12 years ago - that reflects &quot;where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world&quot;.


Full Circle also dropped an official name in the form of &quot;Skate.&quot; (that fullstop is here to stay it seems), and a new setting in San Vansterdam - described as a sister city to previous games&#x27; San Vanelona.

                              <span>Following its reveal last week, Ubisoft has now shown off three minutes of gameplay footage from its upcoming free-to-play mobile shooter The Division Resurgence in a new trailer.


Resurgence (not to be confused with Heartland, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play Division game for PC and consoles), will, like other entries in the series, be an open-world third-person shooter RPG set in post-crisis America - in this case, Manhattan - following a deadly virus outbreak.


It does promises a fresh story campaign, in which players once again take on the role of an agent allied to the Strategic Homeland, delivering a &quot;new perspective on key story events&quot;.

                              <span>An engineer has built a real-life working SPNKR rocket launcher from Halo. Best of all, it also plays the Halo theme. 


YouTuber Jairus of All is the person behind this engineering marvel, who in a nine-minute video explains how he got this thing to work (thanks, PC Gamer).


To add a cherry on top, Jairus handed over the launcher to &quot;Master Chief&quot; who fired it at a lake on the back of a Mongoose.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - it&#x27;s all about Nintendo Switch, which is quietly having yet another brilliant year.

The last few days have seen confirmation of a new Kirby game and a Bayonetta 3 release date (finally!), adding to a solid year so far and a strong end to 2022 which will also see the likes of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Splatoon 3, Mario Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It&#x27;s a bumper crop - especially compared to this year&#x27;s lack of first-party launches on PlayStation and - most of all - Xbox.

At the same time, the way Nintendo is detailing these games is changing. Notably, there&#x27;s been no big E3 week Nintendo Direct this year, as the company keeps information on Zelda and Metroid under wraps. Is this leading to an even bigger 2023 - perhaps with new Switch hardware too? Eurogamer&#x27;s Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan discuss.

Some of the main feature updates and quality of life improvements due to be released in Season 3 have been pushed back to Season 4.


This includes a new iteration of the Ranked mode, dubbed Ranked 2.0; restrictions on voice chat for players who are verbally abusive on mic; and the Reputation Score display beta.

Sound familiar? It certainly looks an awful lot like Mini Metro, the puzzle strategy game from New Zealand developer Dinosaur Polo Club. 


Mini Subway is available for £3.59 and has been developed by Red Fables, published by Cooking and Publishing.

DLC packs for Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2, plus Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 (except for that game&#x27;s multiplayer packs) are all now available without charge, EA has said in an email to fans shared via reddit.


Remaining BioWare Points can be spent on those Mass Effect 3 multiplayer packs (if you still have any points lying around), before they disappear forever on 11th October.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 doesn&#x27;t have turn-based combat, in a bid to appeal to a younger audience.


That&#x27;s according to producer Naoki Yoshida speaking to Famitsu (and translated by VGC) in an extensive new interview on the game.


&quot;I&#x27;m from a generation that grew up with command and turn-based RPGs,&quot; said Yoshida. &quot;I think I understand how interesting and immersive it can be. On the other hand, for the past decade or so, I&#x27;ve seen quite a number of opinions saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand the attraction of selecting commands in video games&#x27;.

                              <span>The global PC market has reportedly faced a sharp drop in shipments in the second quarter of 2022. 


According to preliminary data analysed by research firm Gartner, sales fell by 12.6 percent year-on-year to 72.01m units. 


Gartner puts the decline down to three main causes: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis caused by inflation and steep downturn in demand for Chromebooks.

This will add skating-based areas, and pixelly versions of Tony Hawk you can buy as NFTs. Confused? Here&#x27;s a visualisation of how it&#x27;ll look:


&quot;What&#x27;s up guys it&#x27;s Tony Hawk, and we are building the biggest skate park in the metaverse,&quot; the skater says in the video. &quot;You have never seen skating like this. I&#x27;ll see you in The Sandbox.&quot;

                              <span>Rumbleverse - the free-to-play &quot;brawler royale&quot; from developer Iron Galaxy Studios - has, following a bit of a delay, been given a new release date, and is launching for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via the Epic Games Store) on 18th August.


Iron Galaxy Studios, which is perhaps best known as the developer behind the 2013 version of Killer Instinct, announced Rumbleverse during last year&#x27;s Game Awards, describing the 40-person, melee-focused battle royale game as &quot;big, hilarious playground where spectacular things are always happening&quot;.


It was initially due to launch into early access on 8th February this year, but Iron Galaxy opted to delay its release indefinitely, saying &quot;there&#x27;s more we want to do to perfect the experience.&quot;

The PS1 and PSP games were strangely only mentioned on the Italian PlayStation Blog as part of the list of titles coming to the subscription service this month (thanks, Push Square).


But the games have now been removed from the post, suggesting that it was listed by accident.

The build already has a multiplayer capability, which modders have enabled.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t expect to see an Aztec setting for Assassin&#x27;s Creed in the near future - despite a high-profile rumour to the contrary.


Yesterday, a claim the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game would be set in the Aztec era gained traction online, sourced from a Twitter user who had previously leaked details of fellow Ubisoft series Far Cry.


Now, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has debunked the Aztec claim - while also corroborating Eurogamer&#x27;s reporting earlier this year that Baghdad would be featured in the franchise&#x27;s next title.

                              <span>The Sega Genesis Mini 2 is heading to North America this October.


The mini retro console was revealed to Japan last month, with a release date of 27th October. That&#x27;s now confirmed for North America too.



There&#x27;s no confirmed release date yet for Sega fans in other countries - presumably the name will be changed to Mega Drive Mini 2 as well.

                              <span>Researchers have a new way to de-anonymize browser users, by correlating their behavior on one account with their behavior on another:
The findings, which NJIT researchers will present at the Usenix Security Symposium in Boston next month, show how an attacker who tricks someone into loading a malicious website can determine whether that visitor controls a particular public identifier, like an email address or social media account, thus linking the visitor to a piece of potentially personal data.
When you visit a website, the page can capture your IP address, but this doesn’t necessarily give the site owner enough information to individually identify you. Instead, the hack analyzes subtle features of a potential target’s browser activity to determine whether they are logged into an account for an array of services, from YouTube and Dropbox to Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and more. Plus the attacks work against every major browser, including the anonymity-focused Tor Browser...</span>

                              <span>Immortality: An Interactive Movie Trilogy - the upcoming Hollywood-inspired  investigative horror game from Her Story and Telling Lies creator Sam Barlow - has been delayed until 30th August to &quot;ensure the experience is as polished as possible&quot;.


Immortality, which was initially due to launch on 26th July, tells the story of Marissa Marcel, a (fictional) actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.


As with Barlow&#x27;s previous titles, it&#x27;s a story presented in non-linear fashion that players must slowly piece together themselves by scouring through reams of FMV video. But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose &quot;hacked&quot; webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage - using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device - to find out what happened to Marissa Marcel.

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge - the critically acclaimed, retro-inspired beat-em-up from developer Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu has shifted over 1m copies since it launched a little under a month ago in June.


Shredder&#x27;s Revenge has, of course, gone down a storm since its release on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan was just one of many to be won over by its charmingly reinvigorated classic side-scrolling brawling action (which comes with a bunch of pleasing mod-cons, including online co-op support for up to six players), calling it a &quot;wonderful thing, colourful, pacey, and filled with perfect Turtles music.&quot;


Clearly, with Shredder&#x27;s Revenge having now officially surpassed the 1m sales mark - as announced on Twitter - plenty of others have equally been in the mood for Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael&#x27;s retro return.

Then there&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on PS5, which includes the Yuffie-starring INTERmission episode (PS4 owners can access the original Remake game).

                              <span>A fan of the original Mass Effect has created an opening credits sequence for the game - in the style of League of Legends animated show Arcane, one of the best things on Netflix. 


Posted to reddit by user ZeoNyph, the video replaces the models of Arcane&#x27;s heroes with Mass Effect&#x27;s main characters. So, in place of Arcane&#x27;s sister stars Vi and Jynx, we have FemShep and Liara - a little generous to the latter perhaps, though both Liara and Jynx are associated with the colour blue.


Next up, there&#x27;s brief shots of boring Kaiden Alenko swapped into the place of Jayce, fan-favourite engineer fangirl Tali in the place of Viktor, and then space bro Garrus - who as a cop gets the spot of Caitlyn.

The third instalment in the Evil Dead franchise, the film sees its lead characters trapped in the Middle Ages to battle the undead.


Fittingly, this medieval-themed DLC adds a new map featuring the film&#x27;s iconic Castle Kandar - check it out in the trailer below.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3 will include a family-friendly mode to cover up the game&#x27;s partial nudity.


Following the announcement of the game&#x27;s release date - that&#x27;s 28th October - a tweet from developer Platinum Games shows a video of the mode that&#x27;s not been included in previous Bayonetta games.


It&#x27;s called &quot;Naive Angel Mode&quot; and will have the titular witch completely covered in all scenes, as well as extra coverage on her demonic form&#x27;s breasts.

                              <span>The long-awaited Nintendo Switch exclusive Bayonetta 3 will finally launch on 28th October, a new trailer has confirmed.
Platinum Games&#x27; threequel was first announced nearly five years ago, and has been MIA for much of that time. Today&#x27;s lengthy trailer offers us a good look at the game, however. Here it is:
&quot;The titular Umbra Witch must face a mysterious evil using her signature guns and time-slowing Witch Time ability,&quot; Nintendo writes. &quot;This time, invading man-made bioweapons called Homunculi find themselves in Bayonetta&#x27;s crosshairs.&quot;

                              <span>The upcoming remake of cult classic Lollipop Chainsaw will not make broad changes to the story or design of the original game, its producer has said. 


This includes the potential of any changes to the look of its main character, the cheerleader Juliet Starling, who spends the game slashing through hordes of zombies in a skimpy outfit. 


A new statement on the remake was posted to Twitter last night by producer Yoshimi Yasuda, in a bid to clear up fan confusion over several lines from the project&#x27;s original announcement.

The DLC was released across all platforms and adds a new island to the game, along with a host of new bosses to defeat.


By 2020, the original game had sold 6m copies, so this means a considerable portion of players have picked up the new DLC.

In a blog post mentioning the leak, developer Full Circle revealed that it comprised a version of the game dating back to September 2021 that was &quot;never intended for external use&quot; - rather than a leaked playtest or demo.


&quot;While we understand you&#x27;re excited to get into the game, we encourage you to be careful when downloading files from unknown sources (and remind you of the potential consequences of breaking EA&#x27;s Terms of Service),&quot; Full Circle wrote.

At present, Partners and Affiliates only receive a payment from subscriptions, bits and more at a minimum of $100.


That&#x27;s now being reduced to $50, meaning streamers receiving smaller amounts will get their funds more frequently.

A tweet from the Japanese Metal Gear account celebrating the 35th anniversary of the series mentioned: &quot;We are preparing to resume sales of titles that have been temporarily suspended.&quot;


This likely refers to Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 which were removed from digital stores last year due to licensing issues with the historical footage utilised.

                              <span>The New York Times has announced plans to solidify your precious Wordle statistics via a single account.

The option is being made available to some users now, with more to follow &quot;soon&quot;, The New York Times confirmed via Twitter last night.

A new section called Introduction of a Partnership System notes that since March 2021, employees in a domestic partnership with a same-sex partner have the same benefits as employees in an opposite-sex marriage.


&quot;We have also established that a common-law marriage between couples will be observed in the same way as a legal marriage,&quot; it reads.

The web game rose to popularity in the wake of Wordle and has players guessing the intro to pop songs second by second.


Previously it was powered by Soundcloud, but now Swedish music streaming platform Spotify has acquired the game.

                              <span>This is an excellent essay outlining the post-Roe privacy threat model. (Summary: period tracking apps are largely a red herring.)
Taken together, this means the primary digital threat for people who take abortion pills is the actual evidence of intention stored on your phone, in the form of texts, emails, and search/web history. Cynthia Conti-Cook’s incredible article “Surveilling the Digital Abortion Diary details what we know now about how digital evidence has been used to prosecute women who have been pregnant. That evidence includes search engine history, as in the case of the prosecution of Latice Fisher in Mississippi. As Conti-Cook says, Ms. Fisher “conduct[ed] internet searches, including how to induce a miscarriage, ‘buy abortion pills, mifepristone online, misoprostol online,’ and ‘buy misoprostol abortion pill online,&#x27;” and then purchased misoprostol online. Those searches were the evidence that she intentionally induced a miscarriage. Text messages are also often used in prosecutions, as they were in the prosecution of Purvi Patel, also discussed in Conti-Cook’s article...</span>

We are excited to announce the v0.5.0 release of Gateway API. For the first
time, several of our most important Gateway API resources are graduating to
beta. Additional, we are starting a new initiative to explore how Gateway API
can be used for mesh and introducing new experimental concepts such as URL
rewrites. We&#x27;ll cover all of this and more below.
What is Gateway API?
Gateway API is a collection of resources centered around Gateway resources
(which represent the underlying network gateways / proxy servers) to enable
robust Kubernetes service networking through expressive, extensible and
role-oriented interfaces that are implemented by many vendors and have broad
industry support.

Come Season 4&#x27;s arrival, players on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation will be able to band together in order to quell the Xenomorph threat, which should help bolster the available pool of potential cohorts for faster matchmaking.


Crossplay will be accompanied by a new game mode - known as Restock Turrets - which does pretty much exactly what its name implies, challenging players to keep their turrets stocked in order to defend their position and fight off Xenomorph waves.

                              <span>Tomonobu Itagaki - the Japanese designer best known for creating Tecmo&#x27;s Dead or Alive series and rebooted Ninja Gaiden games - has announced his new company Apex Game Studios, which is currently &#x27;incubating&#x27; an NFT-focused MMORPG for mobile and PC names Warrior.


Itagaki shared his announcement on Twitter, explaining Apex Game Studios would specialise in creating &quot;high-quality and immersive&quot; triple-A &quot;Web3&quot; titles - Web 3.0 being the umbrella term incorporating (frequently controversial) technologies such as blockchain and NFT.


Apex Game Studios&#x27; first project, Warrior, is an MMORPG developed in Unreal Engine that&#x27;s due to launch in Q1 next year. Unfortunately, details remain pretty limited at this juncture, with the official website being primarily interested in detailing the NFT economy at Warrior&#x27;s core.

&quot;The team is still working on our upcoming Halo Infinite network co-op Insider flight build. While we always said our &#x27;target was the week of July 11&#x27;, many sites reported it simply as &#x27;starting July 11.&#x27; Still hoping for this week, but it will not start today,&quot; tweeted Jarrard yesterday.

On Thursday, a security researcher who goes by Kevin2600 published a technical report and videos on a vulnerability that he claims allows anyone armed with a simple hardware device to steal the code to unlock Honda vehicles. Kevin2600, who works for cybersecurity firm Star-V Lab, dubbed the attack RollingPWN.

In a phone call, Kevin2600 explained that the attack relies on a weakness that allows someone using a software defined radio—such as HackRF—to capture the code that the car owner uses to open the car, and then replay it so that the hacker can open the car as well. In some cases, he said, the attack can be performed from 30 meters (approximately 98 feet) away...</span>

                              <span>When was the last time you played a game on Facebook? Well, Meta is hoping to tempt you back to its platform with an interesting prospect: a daily, choice-based narrative experience taking place over the course of the next four months, titled The Walking Dead: Last Mile.


A massively interactive live event (MILE), the project is a collaboration between publisher Genvid, which specialises in these part-game, part-interactive stream, part-live show creations, with design and narrative input from The Walking Dead&#x27;s team at Skybound and funding from Facebook.


The big sell is that Last Mile is a new chapter of The Walking Dead&#x27;s lore, which will unfold across the next couple of months based upon decisions made by players, with the resulting narrative becoming franchise &quot;canon&quot; in line with the original comic books.  And for fans of Telltale&#x27;s The Walking Dead games, there&#x27;s a clear influence in art style and design language, if not gameplay.

                              <span>A new novel based in the Halo universe is coming to stores on 9th August.
This book, which is called Halo: The Rubicon Protocol, will act as a prequel to Halo Infinite and tells of the six months before Master Chief wakes up and the game&#x27;s campaign begins.
It sounds like this will offer up some useful bits of background information for those who started Halo Infinite and found themselves a touch confused by what exactly was going on. While some of this history can be picked up in-game thanks to some well-placed audio logs, it could definitely be made clearer for players from the off.

The ongoing effects of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine have left the project&#x27;s announcement in &quot;limbo&quot;, Venturebeat&#x27;s Jeff Grubb has said, writing on Twitter that &quot;GoldenEye is still in limbo because of the war&quot;. 
Eurogamer also understands this to be accurate. We have contacted Microsoft for further comment.

                              <span>The newly-released Skyrim Together Reborn co-op mod has got off to an incredible start. In fact, it has already been downloaded more than 50k times since its release on Friday. 
Along with this new mod for The Elder Scrolls 5, the Together team has also shared a little update about its purpose. Calling it a &quot;passion project&quot; by a small handful of volunteers, the developer revealed it had tested it out with &quot;30+ players&quot;, although this did not strictly make it an MMO. 
&quot;The aim of the mod is to develop a true Skyrim multiplayer experience that brings online multiplayer into this otherwise strictly single player game,&quot; the Together team explained, stating it is aimed for use by two to eight players at a time.

                              <span>Yes, there&#x27;s another weird and wonderful way to play through Elden Ring - playing the piano.


Omunchkin13 posted a video over on reddit of his Elden Ring completion using a piano as a controller.


While the piano still plays music, don&#x27;t expect a full concerto - it&#x27;s more experimental jazz - but this is still a very impressive feat.

                              <span>Kojima Productions has threatened legal action over social media posts identifying Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima as the man who assassinated ex-Japanese prime ministor Shinzo Abe. 


Abe, the highly-respected former leader of Japan, died last week in a shooting that shocked Japan and prompted international outcry. A 41-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene. 


Over the weekend, internet users began to circulate an old photograph of Kojima online, identifying the image as that of the suspect.

                              <span>Low sales of the Wii U weren&#x27;t the only reason Nintendo decided to not offer dual GamePad support on its somewhat underwhelming console. The decision was also due to a general lack of suitable games to actually make its implementation worthwhile, former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has said.
Speaking to MinnMax, Fils-Aimé stated: 
&quot;What was interesting is that with the Wii U, there was a full development plan for all of the interesting interactions and all of the interesting capabilities that the system could do, and so in that case, technically could multiple gamepads communicate with a Wii U? Answer was &#x27;yes&#x27;, but the install base never got large enough that that type of implementation made sense.&quot;

Armed with bombs, Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPGs) and General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG), the attackers, who arrived at about 10:05 p.m. local time, gained access through the back of the prison, using dynamites to destroy the heavily fortified facility, freeing 600 out of the prison’s 994 inmates, according to the country’s defense minister, Bashir Magashi….

What’s interesting to me is how the defenders got the threat model wrong. That attack isn’t normally associated with a prison break; it sounds more like a military action in a civil war...</span>

                              <span>Professional gamer Philip &quot;ImperialHal&quot; Dosen hit the headlines this weekend after he held off from shooting an opponent in a competitive match when he realised the enemy player had been disconnected.

As spotted by Apex Legends Intel, ImperialHal was competing in the Apex Legends Global Series 2022 - a championship with a cool $2 million up for grabs - when he spied a lone player off in the distance. After monitoring them for a couple of seconds, he told his TSM teammates: &quot;Dont shoot him. Don&#x27;t shoot him, bro! He&#x27;s crashed&quot;.

                              <span>A developer who worked on Naughty Dog&#x27;s upcoming PS5 remake of The Last of Us Part 1 has hit back at claims it&#x27;s &quot;just a cash grab&quot;.

In a tweet on his personal Twitter account, Robert Morrison - whose credits also include Resident Evil 7, Injustice 2, and Santa Monica Studios&#x27; 2018 God of War reboot - countered such claims by insisting it is &quot;the most meticiously built and crafted project&quot; that&#x27;s had &quot;the highest level of care and attention to detail possible&quot;.

Animator Morrison - who worked on The Last of Us Part 1 and now works at fellow Sony studio, Bend - said: &quot;Actually, it’s the most meticulously built and crafted project that I have ever seen or been a part of in my entire career.

                              <span>Surprise! Valve has pushed out another update for its beleaguered bot-ladened shooter, Team Fortress 2.

Whilst not quite as impactful as the last patch, the game&#x27;s Steam page explains how the update hopes to address &quot;exploits and stability issues&quot;.

The long bulletpointed list includes mostly quality of life (QoL) fixes, but some new game server settings will now enable server operator to &quot;limit the amount of processing time the gamer server can spend on processing packets for each client per tick&quot;. Clients that send packets causing server CPU processing time to exceed the configured number of milliseconds will be kicked.

                              <span>Respawn has a new singleplayer FPS set in the Apex Legends universe in early development.

Known only as &quot;Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title&quot;, the game is clearly in the very early stages, but already the team is looking to bring a host of new developers on to what seems to be a singleplayer shooter that will be a &quot;brand new Respawn single-player adventure&quot;.

Respawn&#x27;s careers page, first noticed by Dextero, is currently hiring for numerous projects, including Apex Legends, its Mobile equivalent, the upcoming Star Wars FPS, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Fallen Order&#x27;s recently announced sequel. But also included in the list is that Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title, too.

That&#x27;s according to producer Mariko Sato, who told IGN (via NME) that the remaster will be &quot;visually aligned and up to the standards of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake&quot;, meaning it should run at 120fps on PC, and 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X.

As for Nintendo Switch? Sato reportedly didn&#x27;t expand on that, only saying that there would be “differences” in the resolution and FPS on Nintendo&#x27;s handheld system.

                              <span>Blizzard has confirmed that it will be tweaking both Mercy and Symmetra in the Overwatch 2 beta mid-cycle patch.

In a blog on the official website, Blizzard said that the team has been hard at work &quot;compiling player feedback, [and] squashing bugs&quot;, and revealed that part of this will be revisiting Mercy&#x27;s changes in light of fan feedback.

Healer Mercy received some minor nerfs when the beta test kicked off, such as her character automatically launching into the air when reaching an ally. Now, however, Blizzard is changing it so that you can decide if and when to jump… even though it seems as though that particular ability was a complete accident in the first place.

                              <span>A new leak has given us an early peek at what games may be coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium next month.

According to ResetEra&#x27;s BlackBate - a mysterious poster who&#x27;s correctly leaked games ahead of schedule before - it looks like subscribers to Sony&#x27;s top two PS+ tiers will see the following games join the collection: Stray (which ties in with what we already knew), FFVII Remake Intergrade + FF7R EPISODE INTERmission, Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV Black Flag, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Rogue Remastered, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Freedom Cry, Assassin&#x27;s Creed The Ezio Collection, and Saints Row IV: Re-Elected.

BlackBate reckons the games will join the PS Plus library on 19th July - yes, Stray&#x27;s release date - and states that these are only &quot;some of the games&quot;, perhaps hinting there are more to come.

                              <span>Award-winning writer and narrative designer Anna Megill has taken over as narrative lead on Playground Games&#x27; Fable reboot.

Megill - who was previously lead writer for the project and is who we have to &quot;thank&quot; for those nightmareish puppets in Control - made the announcement on Twitter, saying she had some &quot;exciting news to end the week&quot;.

Megill&#x27;s CV is an impressive one, featuring story-rich games such as Control - for which she was also narrative lead - Dishonored: Death of the Outsider, and Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

                              <span>Blizzard is celebrating the recent seventh anniversary of its MOBA Heroes of the Storm by trimming development in order to focus only &quot;on client sustainability and bug fixing&quot;. 

In a brief update posted yesterday on the official website, Blizzard said it would now treat the MOBA in a &quot;manner similar to our other longstanding games, StarCraft and StarCraft II&quot; by continuing seasonal rolls and hero rotations, but with no plans for new &quot;for-purchase content to be added&quot;.

As a thank you to all who&#x27;ve stuck with the game, Blizzard is offering the &quot;incredibly rare&quot; Epic Arcane Lizard mount to all players with next week’s patch.

This new Team Deathmatch sees four duos duking it out to take control of five arenas across the Prague map, whilst the new Summer pass - offering 100 &quot;levels of progression&quot; - will be available for &quot;only&quot; 600 tokens. 

Sharkmob also confirms that instead of the &quot;standard&quot; 12-week battle pass, Bloodhunt will now focus on monthly content drops instead.

At one meter/four feet long, it&#x27;s a &quot;faithful&quot; 1:1 replication that includes an illuminated scope and comes in &quot;premium showpiece packaging, covered with intricate details inspired from Destiny lore&quot;.

&quot;In addition to capturing the look of this overpowering launcher, the NERF LMTD Gjallarhorn blaster includes the first-ever NERF Mega dart shells, which each hold 3 NERF Mega darts and fire 3 darts at a time,&quot; Bungie explains. &quot;Load a shell into the breech, prime, and pull the trigger to send all 3 darts bursting from the blaster. The NERF Gjallarhorn blaster includes 3 shells and 9 darts.&quot;

Out on 13th July as part of Update 18.2 - initially just for PC, I&#x27;m afraid; the console release will follow on 21st July - Deston includes a flooded downtown, a swamp, coastlines, &quot;one of the tallest skyscrapers in the game&quot; as well as the Lodge, the &quot;biggest building ever made&quot; in the game.

                              <span>IO Ineractive has given us a first look at the new level coming to Hitman 3, known as Ambrose Island.
Agent 47 is certainly not one to stay put for long, and he is now readying himself for his next holiday (sorry, I mean mission). While many of us can only dream of having the opportunity to see the world as readily as he does, for Agent 47 this is all just part of a standard day. So, what of his next destination? 
Well, once you set yours and 47&#x27;s feet onto the tropical isles of Ambrose Island you will most definitely be stepping into dangerous territory. In fact, you will be stepping into pirate territory. So, you had better get ready for your buckles to be swashed. You can check out the new reveal trailer below.

                              <span>Rockstar has told fans not to expect any further major updates for Red Dead Online, as it continues to shift development resource towards Grand Theft Auto 6.


It&#x27;s bad news for Red Dead Online players, who have for some time complained the game had been underserved and overlooked by Rockstar in comparison to the more lucrative GTA Online. 


Now, Rockstar has laid out its plan to keep Red Dead Online on life support and acknowledged its greater focus on GTA6.

A new trailer for the upcoming release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has given us all a closer look at gameplay. Here, we see the titular Gollum scaling walls, skulking in the shrubbery, and popping off orcs with rocks. 
We also get to have a closer look at some of the other characters from Middle-earth. These include Gandalf and the elven king Thranduil, a mysterious new elf (who I suspect may be Mel from the preview I was invited to earlier this year), the Nazgûl and the eight-legged wonder Shelob. You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>Facebook&#x27;s parent company has detailed its new Meta account system, which will be offered as an alternative way of logging in to Meta VR devices.


Previously-announced plans to make Facebook logins a requirement for Meta VR headsets had been hugely unpopular and plagued with problems. 


Now, we know roughly when and how an alternative plan will be put into practice: in August, and via the launch of a fresh, pared-back account system with a separate social profile named Meta Horizon.

                              <span>EA is battling further leaks of Skate, as videos of its playtest emerge online.


The playtest was recently announced, allowing players a look at an early build of the game. But already details have been leaking from it, including information on its map, character customisation, and in-game currency.


Now videos from the playtest have popped up on reddit, giving everyone a look at the game.

                              <span>Hot off the heels of The Quarry, another horror-filled game from Supermassive is coming our way. This time, we&#x27;re heading back to its Dark Pictures series, with The Devil in Me.
A new trailer for this upcoming release has given us two things. The first is a launch window of this autumn. The second is an unnerving look at the game&#x27;s Saw-like story, which sees a group of film makers make their way to to a replica of the &#x27;Murder House&#x27; of HH Holmes, America&#x27;s first serial killer. Obviously, things are not going to go smoothly for our group of intrepid young&#x27;uns.
Unlike previous entries in its Dark Pictures series, The Devil in Me does not appear going down the paranormal or supernatural route. Rather, it looks to be rooted in a pretty grim but very believable reality akin to the aforementioned Saw and the Hostel series of films. There are traps for our unsuspecting victims to trigger, there&#x27;re torture rooms, there is tension, and there are some creepy-as mannequins. You can see for yourself below.

                              <span>Pokémon Puzzle League for the N64 will be the next Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack game, Nintendo has announced. 


Originally launched in 2000, this pocket monster puzzler plays similarly to Panel de Pon, albeit with tiles themed around Pokémon types.


Perhaps my favourite thing about it is the game&#x27;s heavily influence from the early days of the Pokémon anime - so expect appearances and slightly distorted sound clips from Ash, Misty, Brock and Team Rocket as you clear tiles. Here&#x27;s a refresher:

                              <span>We&#x27;re getting a pair of new games themed around 1980s action movie icons Terminator and RoboCop.


Both were announced last night during publisher Nacon&#x27;s latest showcase, with RoboCop: Rogue City coming from Teyon, the developer behind the very wonky Terminator: Resistance.


RoboCop: Rogue City will be a first-person shooter, and of the two new games looks to be one we&#x27;ll see launch first - in June 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Let&#x27;s take a look:

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra said his company wanted &quot;to return to a live event that enables us to celebrate the community&quot; and was &quot;committed to bringing back BlizzCon&quot; next year.

                              <span>Mike Ybarra, the head of Blizzard, has spoken out about the controversial microtransactions found in Diablo Immortal. 

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Ybarra implied that complaints surrounding Diablo Immortal&#x27;s in-game purchases were limited to a small minority, and indeed, that Blizzard had specifically designed its free-to-play experience so the majority of players would still enjoy the bulk of the game. 


Ybarra pointed to the game&#x27;s high rating and number of positive reviews on the App Store, and suggested these contrasted with  some of the negative headlines and complaints which have been reported.

                              <span>For those that recall the 2003 E3 demo for Halo 2 - yes, the Earthcity one that everyone loved at the time but that never made its way into the final game - I have good news for you. 343 Industries has teamed up with some modders, and as a result, almost two decades later we will soon be able to actually play that demo again.
&quot;We have a special treat for you this month,&quot; started 343 community writer Alex Wakeford in a very in-depth blog post yesterday.
&quot;Something that becomes part of the great journey of many Halo fans is learning about all the stuff that didn&#x27;t make it into the games over the years,&quot; he teased before revealing, &quot;I can confirm we are working on a rebuild of the original E3 Earthcity scenario that makes it playable in modern retail Halo 2.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has said it will attend Gamescom 2022, which returns in-person to Cologne in August for the first time in three years. 


Details on what exactly Microsoft will show remain vague, other than a promise we&#x27;ll see updates on previously-announced games set to be released over the coming 12 months.


This is a similar-sounding promise to what we saw recently at the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase, which concluded with new gameplay footage of Starfield.

                              <span>Iconic Elden Ring player Let Me Solo Her has received a congratulatory sword from the game&#x27;s publisher.


The player became notorious in the Elden Ring community for assisting players with the game&#x27;s infamously tricky Malenia boss, defeating her a thousand times.



In response, Bandai Namco sent the player a boxed sword, complete with map scroll and wooden plaque, with the message: &quot;Congratulations on your great accomplishment&quot;.

Both digital stores were quietly made inaccessible back in March. When asked about their status at the time, Nintendo subsequently told Eurogamer the stores were &quot;undergoing maintenance&quot;, and no date was given for their return. 


Indeed, some fans had begun wondering if the stores would ever return at all.

Sharing the news on Twitter, the Falls Guys devs wrote, &quot;We&#x27;re in absolute disbelief... 50 million players in 2 weeks!!!&quot;

                              <span>Report by Georgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technology published a comprehensive report on the surprising amount of mass surveillance conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</span>

The first ad to be reported was for a mobile game app from OneSoft Studio named Naughty Puzzle: Tricky Test. It showed an animated woman wearing what appeared to be short shorts and a vest top struggling to free herself from a broken fence.

                              <span>Playing games online often brings out the worst in people, screaming and raging into a microphone.


But what if you could channel that into controlling the game?

But owners of the Rain Nightclub bought four billboards in Texas and California to advertise their event, which included modded outfits and use of the Final Fantasy 14 logo (thanks PCGamer).

                              <span>It sounds a lot like Marvel&#x27;s Avengers will get She-Hulk as a playable character. 


The detail was dropped rather unexpectedly last night, as part of an official Xbox Twitch livestream for the game featuring streamer Frank &quot;Techniq&quot; Ellerbe and Marvel&#x27;s Avengers lead designer Brian Waggoner. 


In an off-the-cuff comment, Ellerbe claimed his acting coach was actually the voice of She-Hulk in the game, to the obvious surprise of Waggoner - who stated that the character had not yet been officially confirmed.

In fact, you only have a few more days, as the Unreal Engine 5 tech demo will be removed from Xbox series X/S and PlayStation 5 stores on 9th July. 
So, if you want to have a whirl in its bustling and hyper-realistic world, you had better get a wiggle on.

                              <span>Rockstar Games had plans to release a remaster of both Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 4, a new report has claimed. 
However, in light of the pretty poor reception following its GTA trilogy release last year (yes, I am being generous here), the company has now apparently put these ideas to one side.
Sources with knowledge of Rockstar&#x27;s inner workings have now confirmed to Kotaku that recent rumours to this effect were indeed true, and we were meant to be getting a shiny new upgrade for both games. Last year&#x27;s release of the GTA trilogy came as a real blow to Rockstar, however, and now the company is hoping to put all of that bad press behind it.

                              <span>After a three-year hiatus due to Covid, Pokémon Go&#x27;s in-person Go Fests have properly returned. The first of three music festival-sized city gatherings took place this weekend in Berlin and went off smoothly, with the usual mix of rare creatures, boosted Shiny chances and early access to new species.


As ever, it was the feeling of playing Pokémon Go among thousands of others that made the event something special. Along the many pretty paths circling Berlin&#x27;s beautiful Britzer Garden, thousands of Pokémon players plodded along in groups, with friends or in couples, celebrating rare catches or looking on in envy. 


I wasn&#x27;t certain about Berlin as a choice for Go Fest, after the smaller German city of Dortmund hosted the game&#x27;s main European events in previous years so successfully. Not only did Dortmund have a great city park to play in, but its main centre was small enough that when Pokémon Go players turned up, they absolutely took over - fans flooding its small squares and filling restaurant terraces. It created a carnival atmosphere, and seeing the expressions of bemused locals as dozens of people passed by in Pikachu onesies never got old.

                              <span>A speedrunner from the recent Summer Games Done Quick 2022 event has admitted he faked part of his run.


Russian speedrunner Mekarazium completed a live run of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance as one of a handful of online (rather than in-person) runs.


However, an extra run of the game&#x27;s Blade Wolf DLC was offered as a charity donation goal incentive, but Mekarazium has since admitted this run was faked using pre-recorded footage, as PCGamesN reported.

                              <span>We will no longer be getting any Xbox 360 games included with Games with Gold as of this October. 
This is due to the fact that Microsoft has now &quot;reached the limit of [its] ability&quot; for adding new Xbox 360 games to the service, Microsoft stated in an email to customers seen by Eurogamer. 
All is not lost though, as we will still be getting the usual monthly offering of Xbox One games.

&quot;Squid Research Lab here with a meaty discovery - this is rare imagery of a new multiplayer stage,&quot; the Splatoon team tweeted. 
&quot;The facility was made FROM scrap metal in order to make MORE scrap metal. Also, there was a sea here that evaporated. Surely unrelated to heavy industry [ahem]!&quot;

The sale of games, consoles and subscription services contributed to a enormous $191bn global total in 2021, which will fall slightly to $188bn this year, according to Ampere Analysis. 


This follows extraordinary growth through the early stages of the pandemic, with a leap in spending especially noticable from 2020 onwards.

                              <span>Ubisoft recently announced it would pull the plug on a number of its older games, stopping online and multiplayer support. Titles affected by this move include Anno 2070, Far Cry 3, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, and Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2.
However, the powers that be at Ubisoft Mainz, developer of Anno 2070 are not going to let this hinder their game. Oh no sir.

The team behind the city-building and economic simulation game will now &quot;dedicate some of [its] development resources to work on upgrading Anno 2070&#x27;s aged online services infrastructure to a new system&quot;.

                              <span>A remake of Suda51&#x27;s cult zombie game Lollipop Chainsaw has been confirmed for release next year.


Release platforms are yet to be announced, though the original game arrived for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 back in 2012. 


As teased last month, this return is being overseen by Yoshimi Yasuda, the original game&#x27;s executive producer, as part of his new company Dragami Games.

Considering how recently this launched, that is some pretty good going!
In addition to this, the company also revealed that Monster Hunter Rise itself has also passed 10m units sold since its release.
Capcom equates these figures to &quot;a variety of measures including ongoing free updates and the launch of a PC version, as well as with the release of a set that includes Sunbreak.&quot;

Ahead of The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s release for the PS5 (and eventually PC), content creator Speclizer has revisited the first game in Naughty Dog&#x27;s post-apocalyptic world.


They have since shared a compilation of the incredible inclusions from Naughty Dog, many of which can be easily missed on your average playthrough. I am talking about things like Joel&#x27;s buttons being embossed with the words &quot;Naughty Button&quot; or being able to spot Tess&#x27; bite before she reveals her infection.

                              <span>Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End&#x27;s Madagascan jeep chase almost featured a stunt made famous during Sean Connery&#x27;s sixth outing as James Bond (I mean, why not, Drake does look pretty sharp in a dinner jacket after all).
The stunt in question comes from the 1971 film Diamonds are Forever, where Sean Connery&#x27;s Bond tips his vehicle onto two wheels to get through a tight gap (something those in pursuit are, of course, unable to pull off). 
&quot;We actually prototyped doing that [during A Thief&#x27;s End&#x27;s jeep chase],&quot; Uncharted 4&#x27;s co-lead designer Kurt Margenau reflected during a recent chat with Couch Soup. However, as those who have played the game will know, this idea did not ultimately make the final cut.

The huge cache of leaked information - apparently gleaned from the files of a Warzone Mobile alpha build - detailed elements from several upcoming games, including the next release from Black Ops studio Treyarch, due in 2024.


Details were posted to Twitter by user RealiityUK, whose account has now been suspended, though a description of what was posted remains on reddit.

The bundle is in direct response to the overturning of Roe v Wade, key US legislation that grants individuals the right to an abortion. 


The bundle contains over 750 games from over 600 creators available for a minimum donation of $10. Estimated value is over $3k.

                              <span>The modders behind Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition have finally fixed a 20-year-old bug that&#x27;s plagued the PC version of the game.


Previously, an infamous bug when playing on a PC with a multicore processor (as most modern PCs have) would cause the audio to skip and the game to crash, making it all but unplayable.

                              <span>Minecraft maker Mojang has paid tribute to YouTuber Technoblade, whose death from cancer was announced last week. 


Technoblade, real name Alex, had amassed 13 million followers over years of creating Minecraft content. He was just 23.


His passing prompted an outpouring of messages from fellow streamers and esports players, as well as acknowledgement from Mojang itself. Now, the developer has gone further and updated Minecraft Java Edition&#x27;s launch screen with a nod to Technoblade&#x27;s YouTube icon - a crowned Minecraft pig.

                              <span>Political parties in the Netherlands have broadly backed a new attempt to block the sale of video game loot boxes in the country.


Six parties say they will support the motion, which would bring Dutch law largely in line with Belgium - where loot boxes were outlawed back in 2018 (thanks, Neowin).


The motion describes loot boxes as &quot;a form of gambling&quot; and states &quot;children in video games are manipulated to purchase&quot; such items via in-game microtransactions.

At the time of release on PC in January this year, the game had a concurrent player count of 134,262; now that&#x27;s close to doubling at 231,360 - and it continues to rise.


Sunbreak is a huge new expansion to the game, adding master rank hunts, a plethora of new items, and returning monsters to defeat.

First debuted at the Anime Expo 2022 in Los Angeles, these opening credits are accompanied by Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s &#x27;This Fffire&#x27; from 2004. (A small spot of trivia for your next pub quiz, this is not the only piece of game-inspired media to feature this song. The earlier released and self-produced &#x27;This Fire&#x27; can also be found on the soundtrack from Burnout 3: Takedown.)
Anyway, I digress. Back to Edgerunners, and its new credit sequence which you can check out for yourself below.

The ARPG will debut on PS4 on 31st August, six years after it arrived on PS4 in Japan and over a year later than it arrived in the West on Xbox and PC. 

Like the versions on other consoles, it will be cross-platform compatible and free-to-play, and carry the &quot;New Genesis&quot; sub-title with fully localised text and character voices in English (thanks, Polygon).

Digimon Survive - which &quot;blends visual novel storytelling with tactical battle elements&quot; - has been a long time coming, having been formally delayed three times to &quot;allocate more time to development&quot; and &quot;enhance the quality of the game&quot;.

Featuring over 100 Digimon, this latest game in the Digimon series features a world map that is divided into areas and locations which you will need to scan in order to find  &quot;glitches&quot; for clues and items.

As spotted by ResetEra, Twitter user @RealiityUK - although they&#x27;ve had other accounts taken offline by DMCA strikes - shared the images over the weekend, posting a full thread of what seem to be loading screens from the shooter which they say were discovered in Warzone Mobile test files. 

If true, they show that the multiplayer upcoming maps from Modern Warfare 2 will include a Grand Prix, an oil field, and a museum, as well as others called Codename: SABA, and Hydro.

Most of the games included on the list are getting on a bit, but three-year-old VR game Space Junkies is also getting pulled, and as its a &quot;multiplayer-only title&quot;, you will be &quot;unable to play the game going forward&quot;.

Whilst the singleplayer features for these games will mostly be unaffected, multiplayer modes or online features may be unavailable after 1st September, along with the ability to buy DLC.

As Victoria so perfectly summarised for us at the time, yesterday was a sad day. In less than 24 hours, we got the news that Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert was no longer going to talk about the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island following online abuse, and God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s producer had to ask everyone to remain patient while waiting for more news on the game after we learned that some members of the God of War Ragnarök team were receiving unsolicited pictures of their private parts.

                              <span>Two developers that had been working on a Fallout mod have been offered jobs by Bethesda.

In a statement posted on Twitter, the lead technical adviser and project manager of Fallout: London, a &quot;DLC-sized&quot; mod for Fallout 4, have both been offered jobs; the former as an associate level designer, and the latter a chance to work on Fallout 76. 

Ryan Johnson took up the new job as an associate level designer, albeit only after ensuring his &quot;expected level design tasks&quot; for the mod were complete and succession planning was in place. Dean Carter, however, decided not to take the Fallout 76 position as they wanted to &quot;continue working [on] Fallout: London until the end&quot;.

                              <span>Sucker Punch says it has &quot;no plans to revisit&quot; its Infamous or Sly Cooper franchises.

In a blog celebrating the studio&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the team said that whilst it was &quot;proud to look back on the legacy of characters and stories&quot; it had created, it is now focused &quot;on [its] current project&quot;.

&quot;As we approach 25 years since Sucker Punch first opened, we’re proud to look back on the legacy of characters and stories we’ve created, from Rocket: Robot on Wheels to Sly Cooper and infamous, and most recently Ghost of Tsushima,&quot; the developer said in a blog post.

                              <span>Ubisoft is using its games to help make players aware of the impacts of climate change.

That&#x27;s according to the website Playing for the Planet, an UN-led initiative which seeks to use games to &quot;inspire young people to learn and act in support of the environment&quot;.

For instance, for Riders Republic, Ubisoft says it will host a &quot;short and intense&quot; in-game event in Phoenix which will promote &quot;strategies to reduce wildfire frequency and size as well as have an emotional impact on players regarding the consequences of wildfires&quot;.

                              <span>The Quarry&#x27;s community has come up with a way for players to get hold of the Hard Pass accolade across platforms, something that was seemingly unobtainable due to a known issue.

It has since transpired that some members of the gaming community have even been sending unsolicited pictures of their private parts to members of the God of War Ragnarök team. They somehow believed that this would suddenly make Sony Santa Monica give the world an update on the game&#x27;s release date... How they came to this conclusion is beyond me.
Since all of this has happened, prominent members from the industry have been making their voices heard and have called out the toxic behaviour of these so-called fans.

Campfire, as it&#x27;s known, will allow users to find other players in local communities, make friends, and send group messages.


In the absence of social features in its games, Campfire will act as a companion app.

                              <span>Cult classic cel-shaded shooter XIII was famously remade, and subsequently widely panned, in 2020. However, the remake is getting a second chance, as it is now being basically remade again.
A new statement on the game’s Steam page reads: &quot;To achieve the quality standards and offer an optimal gaming experience, Microids decided to entrust the development of XIII Remake to the French studio Tower Five (Lornsword: Winter Chronicle). Hard at work for more than a year on a major update. This update will be released on September 13th.
&quot;On that date, owners of the game will receive a free update and enjoy the game as intended. The development studio reworked the entire game from the Art Direction to the AI and added numerous technical improvements&quot; (via Kotaku).

                              <span>A Nintendo fan reportedly spent 5m yen (around £30k) on Nintendo stock to ask the company about a potential F-Zero sequel in an annual shareholder meeting.


During the meeting, which took place on Tuesday, the shareholder asked Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa if the company would consider making new games or remakes of its dormant series, specifically F-Zero.


As translated by VGC, Furukawa replied: &quot;It is realistically difficult to develop new titles and remakes, including sequels, for every Nintendo game that people request, but we are very grateful and appreciate the expectations our fans have for our games.&quot;

Last month, Nightdive Studios released its critically-panned remaster of Westwood Studios&#x27; classic point-and-click adventure, delisting the popular fan-made effort in the process.


While buying the Enhanced Edition from GOG also got you the original version, fans slammed the troubled remaster in user reviews, giving it an overall rating of 1.5 stars out of five.

                              <span>Konami has secured Inter Milan as an eFootball exclusive team from July 2024.


In a note to press, Konami said Inter Milan will feature exclusively within eFootball &quot;and no other video game&quot; from July 2024.


That means Inter Milan won&#x27;t be in that year&#x27;s EA Sports FC (EA will ditch the FIFA brand from 2023).

                              <span>Wired is reporting on a new remote-access Trojan that is able to infect at least eighty different targets:
So far, researchers from Lumen Technologies’ Black Lotus Labs say they’ve identified at least 80 targets infected by the stealthy malware, including routers made by Cisco, Netgear, Asus, and DrayTek. Dubbed ZuoRAT, the remote access Trojan is part of a broader hacking campaign that has existed since at least the fourth quarter of 2020 and continues to operate.
The discovery of custom-built malware written for the MIPS architecture and compiled for small-office and home-office routers is significant, particularly given its range of capabilities. Its ability to enumerate all devices connected to an infected router and collect the DNS lookups and network traffic they send and receive and remain undetected is the hallmark of a highly sophisticated threat actor...</span>

                              <span>Maxis continues to tick those much-requested Sims 4 features off the list as fans wait impatiently for news of the Sims 5, with the developer having now confirmed it&#x27;ll finally be giving teen Sims a proper education in its newly announced High School Years Expansion Pack, due 28th July.


High School Years, which follows the release of The Sim 4&#x27;s excellent Werewolves Game Pack earlier this month, does pretty much exactly what you&#x27;d assume it does based on its name, giving players the option to send teenage Sims off to Copperdale High for a few years of learning and post-class socialising with peers.


Its first big addition is the new location of Copperdale. Nestled on the banks of Lake LaSuli, this small town plays home to more than just the local high school; it also incorporates a library, the principal&#x27;s lavish mansion, a thrift store/boba hangout known as ThrifTea, and an amusement park, complete with haunted house, tunnel of love, ferris wheel, and photo booth.

                              <span>Earlier this week, news broke of a modder that hacked AMD&#x27;s FSR 2.0 temporal upscaling technology into Cyberpunk 2077, allowing users of non-RTX graphics cards the chance to play the game at higher frame-rates with substantially better visual quality than with FSR 1.0 upscaling. That&#x27;s massive for owners of AMD GPUs, and the mod even works beautifully on Steam Deck. 
We contacted the mod&#x27;s creator, the gloriously named PotatoOfDoom1337, to find out exactly how it works - and whether it means that FSR 2.0 will soon be available in a tonne of existing games. Here&#x27;s the interview, edited lightly for clarity. Enjoy!

What&#x27;s your background in programming and game modding? On NexusMods, it looks like you&#x27;ve only been creating mods since April last year?

That means we could see the likes of Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Catherine following in the footsteps of Sonic the Hedgehog and his recent film success.

IGN reports that for Sega, expanding storytelling forms is a new and important part of its business strategy.

                              <span>Arkane and Bethesda have given us all a bite sized teaser highlighting the thrills and bloody spills that are coming our way in Redfall. 
&quot;The town of Redfall is under siege by a legion of vampires who have cut the island off from the outside world,&quot; the description reads. &quot;Trapped with a handful of survivors, choose from a roster of heroes to create the perfect team of vampire slayers and take back Redfall.&quot;
Said heroes are Layla Ellison (the &quot;telekinetic threat student in debt), Devinder &quot;Dev&quot; Crousley (the &quot;verified cryptid hunter&quot;), Jacob Boyer (the &quot;deadeye with an undead eye&quot;) and Remi de la Rosa (the &quot;ingenious ingeniera&quot;). You can check out the new trailer below.

                              <span>Kirby and the Forgotten Land was a colourful and welcome splash of fun on its release in March. One of its most adorable features (of which there are many) was the ever-evolving Waddle Dee Town, which has its own café. 
At this café, you can purchase a selection of eats to help Kirby on his quest to free the Waddle Dees, including the Car-Mouth Cake. This cake will cost Kirby 20 coins and will recover some health. But, let&#x27;s be honest, its reviving properties are not what we really love about it. What we really love is the fact that it is an adorable, edible Carby.
Now, the Kirby Café in Tokyo and Hakata in Japan has updated its menus to include a real Car-Mouth Cake for us to enjoy (I mean, if we are ever in the area).

&quot;BotW Multiplayer is finally here,&quot; PointCrow&#x27;s Twitch channel proclaims. &quot;This project would not have been possible without the hard work of Sweet and AlexMangue.&quot; However, as a general FYI for those keen to try this out for themselves, this particular mod isn&#x27;t available to the public.

Then a third banner arose from the crowd: Mae Borowski, the anthropomorphic cat from Night in the Woods.

The aim of Bill 96 is to strengthen the French-speaking province&#x27;s language laws, ensuring French is the main language spoken in everything from business to healthcare.


However, it&#x27;s feared this will drive away non-French speakers from Québec&#x27;s considerable video game industry.

                              <span>Valve has downplayed the performance impact of using slower SSDs in new shipments of the Steam Deck. 


The change was first spotted by German publication HardwareLuxx, which noticed the 256 GB and 512 GB versions of the Steam Deck now ship with either a two-lane or four-lane PCIe Gen 3 SSD. Previously, these versions all came with a faster four-lane SSD. 


Asked by PC Gamer for comment, Valve&#x27;s product designer Lawrence Yang said Valve &quot;determined  that there is no impact to performance between the two models,&quot; and there were only differences between the two drives in &quot;extremely uncommon cases.&quot;

In addition to this, he has closed all comments on his blog. 
&quot;I&#x27;m shutting down comments. People are just being mean and I&#x27;m having to delete personal attack comments,&quot; Gilbert wrote.
He went on to defend the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island, Gilbert&#x27;s first return to the series since 1991&#x27;s LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge.

                              <span>With the second Overwatch 2 beta in full swing, lucky players have shared new features and changes they&#x27;ve encountered.


The original Overwatch wasn&#x27;t updated to natively support the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, so there&#x27;s huge expectation that the sequel will bring the latest and greatest tech features.


Beta players have reported that the game will be able to run at 120 FPS with variable refresh rate (VRR) support. That&#x27;s a huge upgrade for console players who have been locked to 60 FPS on last-gen consoles.

Unity has since released a statement to Protocol acknowledging four percent of its workforce is impacted, which Protocol estimates at roughly over 200 workers.

The picture came from Bit Planet Games, the developer of Ultrawings and its follow up Ultrawings 2. It showed the PS VR2 on a black leather chair.
It wasn&#x27;t much, with the set not even being in use for the photo, but it was enough to quickly catch the ever-watching eyes of the internet before the developer had a chance to remove the post without anyone noticing it. You can see it for yourself below (via Reddit).

                              <span>Pokémon  Go developer Niantic has reportedly fire 85 to 90 members of its staff and cancelled four of its in-development projects - including a previously announced Transformers game and a collaboration with theatre company Punchdrunk - amid &quot;economic turmoil&quot; for the company.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which has shared portions of an email sent to Niantic staff by the company&#x27;s chief executive officer John Hanke.
In the message, Hanke is said to have blamed today&#x27;s project cancellations and redundancies - which will affect around 8% of Niantic&#x27;s workforce - on the company facing &quot;a time of economic turmoil&quot;. Hanke reportedly claimed the moves would help &quot;further streamline our operations in order to best position the company to weather any economic storms that may lie ahead.&quot;

                              <span>RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios&#x27; widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, will finally be making the jump to consoles - some three and a half years after its full PC release - on 29th July.


RimWorld has, of course, made quite the mark on PC since its early access arrival all the way back in 2013 - partly for its wonderfully rich blend of management sim action and procedural storytelling, but equally for the way its complex systems can quickly tumble into outright debauchery, ranging from drug-fuelled cannibalism to non-consensual body harvesting.


Word that a console version of RimWorld was finally on the way arrived in March, although notably not through official channels. Instead, the port - being handled by Double Eleven Limited, which has previously helped port the likes of Minecraft Dungeons and Rust to consoles - hit headlines when it was listed as having been refused classification in Australia.

                              <span>Star Ocean: The Divine Force, the latest entry in publisher Square Enix&#x27;s long-running action-RPG series, now has a release date and will be launching for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 27th October.


Tri-Ace, the studio that&#x27;s been at the helm of the Star Ocean series since its debut in 1996, is once again handling development duties on The Divine Force, which this time follows the stories of dual protagonists Raymond, the captain of the space trading ship Ydas, and Laeticia, the princess-knight of a kingdom on the underdeveloped planet of Aster IV.


Each character offers its own story perspectives and gameplay experiences, and there&#x27;s a taste of Star Ocean: The Divine Force&#x27;s ensuing action in the new trailer accompanying today&#x27;s news.

                              <span>Ubisoft has today unveiled a feast of fresh Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope gameplay footage, showcasing its intriguing new settings, characters and chaos.


This sequel to the excellent Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle takes place in a &quot;whimsical&quot; and gorgeous new galaxy, that&#x27;s a curious blend of both Mario Galaxy and Rabbids universes. Within its orbit float worlds of autumnal colour, frozen snow and sandy beaches, like a Mario Galaxy game in miniature.


The story here revolves around Cursa, a dark entity that wants to absorb this hybrid galaxy&#x27;s energy and capture the Sparks - cute creations that are a mix of Galaxy&#x27;s Lumas and the Rabbids. It&#x27;s up to Mario and his Kingdom Battle crew to save the day, now aided by Rabbid Rosalina, the punky-looking rabbid Edge, and - as we found out yesterday during the latest Nintendo Direct - Bowser himself.

                              <span>In the time it has taken for Earth to complete a single spin on its axis, the gaming community has been out in full force and picked apart the newly launched Portal: Companion Collection for the Nintendo Switch.
The first discovery came from self-proclaimed &quot;Switch tinkerer&quot; OatmealDome. In this case, the modder managed to unearth some Half-Life 2 content tucked away in the Portal: Companion Collection&#x27;s files.
&quot;The entirety of Half-Life 2 (minus maps and music) is present in the ROM,&quot; they wrote via Twitter. &quot;Likely based on the NVIDIA Shield port, with a little Xbox 360 sprinkled in.&quot;

Despite being out for several years, the Zelda community is still finding countless weird and wonderful ways to approach the game - the most recent of which being a completion of every shrine within the game without using any of the runes on the Sheikah Slate.
Content creator Limcube took on this challenge as part of an incredible 28-hour stream and used a variety of techniques to get to their final goal of 120/120 shrines completed.

However, at the time of writing, no further details have been given about what role any of the actors will play on the show&#x27;s release (via Variety). 
MacLachlan is probably best known for his role of Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks, as well as Trey MacDougal in Sex and the City and Orson Hodge in Desperate Housewives. For the fellow parents among us, he is also the voice of Riley&#x27;s father in the very good (and more than just a little bit emotional) Inside Out.

The allegation surfaced this week via a YouTube video from a channel named Upper Echelon Gamers. Titled &quot;What Made Cyberpunk 2077 Fail - Quantic Lab?&quot;, the 14-minute video claimed the QA studio had placed junior members of its team on the project instead of seasoned veterans, and flagged too many minor bugs. 


These issues, the video claimed, impacted Quantic Lab&#x27;s work and therefore the overall game.

                              <span>Pac-Man World Re-Pac, the newly-announced remake of Pac-Man World, will feature Bandai Namco&#x27;s Pac-Mom character instead of the original Ms Pac-Man. 


This is the second time the switch has now occured, after Pac-Mom previously took Ms Pac-Man&#x27;s place in Bandai Namco&#x27;s Arcade Archives: Pac-Land earlier this year.


Again, the reason for the swap seems to be the messy legal issues surrounding ownership of Ms Pac-Man, which are the subject of a 2019 lawsuit.

                              <span>The return of the Monkey Island series with the aptly named Return to Monkey Island was a welcome surprise when it was announced earlier this year (on April Fool&#x27;s Day no less). After all, we had not seen a new game with Guybrush Threepwood at the fore since 2009. 
However, while we are getting a return, this may not be the start of a new wave of games based in the sun-soaked Caribbean islands. Rather, this appears to be the last one of its kind. 
Following its new gameplay trailer yesterday (see above) and the news it will be coming to the Nintendo Switch as a console first, the Return to Monkey Island developers unveiled a new website for the game. It is a great site, with playful interactive options for fans of the series, including the chance to &#x27;chat&#x27; with series regular Stan.

Details dug up from an Xbox store listing point to Skull and Bones having the usual array of pre-order bonuses, as well as premium items for an edition including a soundtrack and artbook.


A release date - 8th November 2022 - was also spied, thanks to regular store watcher Aggiornamenti Lumia, and subsequently verified by serial leaker Tom Henderson.

                              <span>First impressions of Sonic Frontiers have, it&#x27;s fair to say, been mixed - but Sega is forging ahead regardless, now offering a look at the game&#x27;s rendition of Cyber Space, where more &quot;traditional, fast-paced&quot; Sonic stages can be found.


Revealed during today&#x27;s busy Nintendo Direct, Cyber Space is a mysterious digital realm that can be reached by uncovering ancient entrances around Starfall Islands - a cluster of landmasses incorporating Kronos Island, the lush area seen in Sonic Frontiers&#x27; divisive first trailers. 


In order to unlock the Cyber Space entrances, players will first need to earn Portal Gears by solving puzzles and completing challenges around the &quot;open zone&quot; map. Once in Cyber Space, they can try their hand at &quot;traditional, fast-paced, speed running action platforming&quot; - linear stages more in line with classic Sonic action - earning Vault Keys required to progress further.

                              <span>As we ready to catapult with full enthusiasm into summer, Microsoft has announced July&#x27;s Xbox Games with Gold, this time giving subscribers on  Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S access to Torchlight, Thrillville: Off the Rails, Beast of Maravilla Island, and Relicta.


It&#x27;s not exactly a blockbuster line-up then, but there&#x27;s certainly some fun to be had. Developer Runic Games&#x27; Torchlight, for instance, is an enjoyable Diablo-esque dungeon-crawler from 2009. This isn&#x27;t the first time it&#x27;s appeared as part of Xbox Games with Gold though (it was last available in July 2019), so it&#x27;s entirely possible this one is already hanging around your library.


Thrillville: Off the Rails, meanwhile, is the 2007 sequel to Frontier Developments&#x27; Thrillville, an attempt at creating a more accessible spin on the classic theme park sim genre. &quot;It&#x27;s not complex, it&#x27;s not challenging, but it&#x27;s not trying to be,&quot; said Eurogamer in its review. &quot;It&#x27;s an enjoyable family game which also has appeal for retro gaming fans and drunk people.&quot;

                              <span>A new trailer for Gotham Knights (the game, not the TV show) puts the spotlight firmly on Robin.
&quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine a Robin without a Batman,&quot; muses the masked hero, before resolving that he will figure it all out. What then unfolds is a bombastic trailer with Robin showing off his athletic prowess. This includes his various attacks and how he can use &quot;teleportation tech from the Justice League&#x27;s satellite&quot; to &quot;zap [himself] short distances in a fight&quot;.
You can check out this latest spot from Warner Bros. Games below.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct highlighted an arry of third-party games coming to Nintendo Switch through the rest of this year and beyond. As expected, the showcase focused on games made by non-Nintendo companies - but there were still plenty of highlights, and several exclusives.


The show kicked off with Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak, which launches this week. A title update with yet more monsters to slay arrives in August, and has the jazzy title of Seething Bazelgeuse. Oh, and there&#x27;s a demo available now.
Next was the venerable Nier Automata, PlatinumGames&#x27; acclaimed role-playing game from 2017. It&#x27;s now headed to Nintendo Switch via a fresh The End of YoRHa Edition which contains previous DLC and new costumes. It launches on 6th October.

Return to Monkey Island is slated to release sometime this year, and come to consoles first via Nintendo Switch. We have been given some nice titbits of information about its upcoming release, including that it will be starting off at an amusement park (where Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge concluded), but the team has been keeping its cards close to its chest in terms of story and trailer reveals. Well, that was until now.
Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, gave us our first look at some of the game&#x27;s action, including piratical sword fights, explosive nautical combat, and what appears to be Guybrush in some kind of court (bodes well!). We also got to see some returning faces such as Elaine Marley, LeChuck, Murray the talking skull and Wally (to name but a few).

                              <span>Mega Man Battle Network, Capcom&#x27;s turn-based take on its iconic action series, is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PC next year. 


Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be bundling some 10 games in total, with a physical release offering the full set while the digital release will be split across two volumes. There&#x27;ll be extra features such as a music mode featuring some 150 songs and an art gallery containing some 1000 illustrations. 


The Mega Man Battle Network series had an extremely prolific run from 2001 to 2009 on the Game Boy Advance, and was well-received even if it was often hard to distinguish individual titles. There&#x27;s no release date set for Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection beyond a vague 2023 window.

                              <span>A new announcement trailer for Fallout: London is now here, revealing it will release sometime in 2023.
&quot;Fallout: London is a DLC-sized mod for Bethesda&#x27;s Fallout 4. As a continuation of the base game, the mod will allow the player to visit the previously unexplored post-apocalyptic environment of London,&quot; the description explains. 
This mod will be a change from the rest of the Fallout series, as it will not take place in America. The developer hopes this will allow for users to explore &quot;new cultures which have not homogenised with their American counterparts&quot;. It will also mean that players can dive on into &quot;pre-war European history, and the effects the Resource Wars had on the class structured society of pre-war Britain.&quot;

The aim is to shake up the current &quot;meta&quot; and re-balance the game, forcing players to consider new tactics and strategies.


The changes will be added in the forthcoming mid-chapter update for Chapter 24: Roots of Dread - that hits the public test build on 29th June and will be fully implemented in July.

                              <span>Skyrim has been around for quite the time, with many a new edition or various mod upgrades being made available in its 10 plus years on the market. However, we now also have a mod that covers any version of Skyrim that releases even further down the line (which, let&#x27;s be honest, will likely happen).
The mod in question comes from Nexus Mods user xilamonstrr and brings Skyrim&#x27;s big scaly dragons into super sharp focus. I am talking about seeing all the little details, right down to each beast&#x27;s scars, in much, much, higher definition. 
And, while 16k may seem a touch excessive given that most games tend to opt for 1440p, xilamonstrr has a good reason for choosing this resolution. In short, the dragons in Skyrim are huge, and therefore their textures can get stretched more than the other enemies and entities in this world.

                              <span>Ubisoft briefly published a 20th October release date for its promising-looking Nintendo Switch sequel Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. 


The company has yet to officially trumpet the date, but it was live for a while on Ubisoft&#x27;s store (thanks, Gematsu) ahead of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, which is scheduled for 2pm UK time. 


Today&#x27;s announcement stream is set to feature third-party games for Nintendo Switch - of which Sparks of Hope is a prime example. It seems likely we&#x27;ll see this made official then.

                              <span>Ubisoft has said it will attend Gamescom 2022 - a show many other companies have said they will skip.


A brief message posted to Ubisoft&#x27;s Twitter last night revealed the publisher would be present at this August&#x27;s Cologne-based convention, though did not detail what games might be on offer.


Ubisoft&#x27;s decision comes after the recent pull-outs from Sony, Nintendo, Activision Blizzard and Take-Two, which have all chosen not to attend. Microsoft has yet to make an announcement - though it&#x27;s unclear what it might bring.

In addition, Sega and Two Point Studios will today host a Twitch livestream of the game to raise awareness and funds for Mermaids - a charity supporting trans youth and their families.

                              <span>Developer Nightdive Studios has announced that its critically panned remaster of Westwood Studios&#x27; classic point-and-click adventure Blade Runner will now include the well-recieved ScummVM version of the original game on Steam.


Nightdive&#x27;s remaster was announced back in March 2020, but the project appeared to be on a permanent hiatus after the studio told Eurogamer it was struggling to overcome certain &quot;obstacles&quot;. It was a bit of a surprise, then, when Nightdive&#x27;s long-awaited Enhanced Edition of Blade Runner resurfaced earlier this month with a 23rd June release date, but perhaps less of a surprise, given its history, when the remaster launched to less-than-stellar reviews.


For those that purchased the game via GOG, there was some respite in that all copies of the remaster came with the previously available ScummVM version, developed by a dedicated group of enthusiasts. Steam purchasers, however, were stuck with Nightdive&#x27;s inferior remaster - until today, that is, when the studio revealed it would adding the ScummVM version as an alternative download for all purchases.

                              <span>Whispers of a Metroid Prime remaster for Switch have been circulating for quite some time, but a new report has claimed Nintendo is finally almost ready to share the fruits of its labour, and will be releasing the long-rumoured game at the end of this year.


That&#x27;s according to the persistently leaky Jeff Grubb, who shared the news on Giant Bomb&#x27;s Game Mess Mornings show, saying he&#x27;d been told &quot;pretty definitively&quot; that an updated version of Metroid Prime 1 - what he referred to as Metroid Prime Remastered - was set to be one of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;big holiday games&quot; for 2022.


&quot;In the past, this is something I&#x27;d heard was in the works,&quot; Grubb explained, &quot;they have things happening with that game. Now I’ve been told that their plans are to release that game this holiday - I think almost certainly to line up with the 20th anniversary in November.&quot;

                              <span>Following Fall Guys&#x27; successful, if slightly controversial, switch to free-to-play last week, developer Mediatonic has been plugging away to fix any launch week woes, and those continuing efforts have now manifested in a new patch which, among other things, should now enable PS5 players to get into games while in parties.
Beyond that headline fix, and tweaks to resolve a seperate bug preventing players from hearing party members in voice chat, Mediatonic&#x27;s latest patch notes suggest an update primarily targeting smaller issues across all versions of the game, rather than anything particularly seismic, with other fixes including a range of visual issues on Switch. Here&#x27;s the full list of tweaks and adjustments, for the curious, as per the Fall Guys Twitter account:
Fall Guys&#x27; transition to a free-to-pay model seems to have paid off for Mediatonic. Despite some server wobbles on launch day, the developer reported Fall Guy&#x27;s new monetisation model - combined with its launch on two new platforms in Xbox and Switch - managed to push the game&#x27;s player base over the 20m mark just 24 hours after its free-to-play release.

As spotted by Push Square, you are now able to purchase a gift card for £84&#x27;s worth of PS Store credit from outlets such as Amazon UK. This is the annual cost to sign up for PlayStation&#x27;s new PS Plus Extra tier. 
Similarly, you can buy a voucher for £100, and that would cover someone&#x27;s Premium subscription for 12 months.

                              <span>Work has begun again on an eye-catching fan remake of cult classic The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run - now with a round of impressive new features.


A fresh video detailing work on the project has revealed the remake&#x27;s newly-stitched-together open world, and promises further additions in future - such as improvements to the game&#x27;s vehicles, the addition of online multiplayer, a quest system and revamped graphics. 


The project&#x27;s re-emergence now is a little surprising, since an earlier version was previously pulled offline from creator Reuben &quot;Reubs&quot; Ward&#x27;s Patreon to avoid getting into any potential legal issues.

                              <span>Fntastic, the developer of Steam&#x27;s most-wishlisted upcoming title The Day Before, has spoken to Eurogamer about its decision to ask for volunteers to help work on the recently-delayed game.
The studio&#x27;s website states that Fntastic&#x27;s &quot;culture&quot; is &quot;based on the idea of volunteering&quot; and, as such, &quot;every Fntastic member is a volunteer&quot; - paid or not (thanks, Well Played). 
These types of &quot;volunteers&quot; are divided into two categories: full-time and part-time. A full-time volunteer is apparently paid a salary, while a part-time volunteer is expected to take part in &quot;various activities ranging from translating to community moderating&quot;. Writes Fntastic: &quot;Part-time volunteers also can offer their unique skills to improve our projects or create new special features.&quot;

The company, which specialises in artificial intelligence, has developed a video pre-training (VPT) algorithm that allows its AI to learn through viewing.


Unlike previous attempts at creating Minecraft algorithms, OpenAI&#x27;s plays in the same environment as humans using the equivalent of mouse and keyboard actions, making this a huge leap in AI technology.

A previous rumour with word of tomorrow&#x27;s showcase suggested we&#x27;d see the Persona franchise represented, as well as the possibility of Red Dead Redemption 2.

                              <span>Death Stranding&#x27;s Hideo Kojima has revealed he was once cooking up a project similar to Amazon&#x27;s superhero series The Boys. 
&quot;I quit after three episodes of season one,&quot; Kojima wrote on Twitter, discussing the series. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d watch the rest of the show. Actually, I watched a few episodes that were delivered at the time when I was about to start a project that I had been warming up for a long time and put it on hold because the concept was similar (different settings and tricks).&quot;
Kojima went on to state his project would have been a &quot;buddy (male/female) thing with a special detective squad facing off against legendary heroes behind the scenes.&quot; As well as this, Kojima had none other than Hannibal&#x27;s Mads Mikkelsen in mind as his leading man.

                              <span>The PC app for PlayStation Plus is displaying some titles incorrectly, making them inaccessible.


PlayStation Plus is available on PC and allows games to be streamed, but the library differs from the console version.


The main issue is that a number of PS1, 2, and 4 games are listed incorrectly as PS3 titles, which do not load at all when selected. Correctly labelled PS3 games do play as intended.

The detail comes from a 2003 issue of Nintendo Dream magazine, which popular YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming? has now translated.


Zelda series boss Eiji Aounuma was all set to use a theremin as Link&#x27;s musical instrument of choice, with each control stick on the GameCube pad set to control each of Link&#x27;s hands as he manipulated its volume and pitch.

                              <span>Valve designer Lawrence Yang has made a public plea to users, asking them not to mod their devices in a bid to increase the Steam Deck&#x27;s SSD to house a 2242 M.2 NVMe SSD, rather than the 2230 form factor SSD it comes with as standard.
In response to an article reporting one such way of doing this, Yang replied: &quot;Hi, please don&#x27;t do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved. In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for.&quot;
Yang finished by writing that, while the mod in question &quot;may appear to work&quot;, it will &quot;significantly shorten the life of your Deck&quot;. So, certainly something that is best avoided.

Documentation detailing the proposed tie-in suggests Dead by Daylight survivor Meg Thomas will head to Epic Games&#x27; battle royale island as a skin. 


In return, Fortnite&#x27;s cheeky llama mascot will pop up in Dead by Daylight as a charm.

                              <span>Fall Guys players believe it&#x27;s now quicker to level up your battle pass if you lose rather than win.

That&#x27;s because of the game&#x27;s all new progression and monetisation systems that were introduced when the game switched to a free-to-play model earlier this week.

As spotted by Gamerant, players can still level up their battle pass, but with new daily, weekly, and long-term challenges also now available, it seems as though maximising those will help you progress faster than winning matches... and given the time it takes to secure a winning crown, you could potentially earn the same amount of Fame more quickly just by crashing out in early rounds.

                              <span>Skull &amp; Bones has been rated by the ERSB, leading some to hope that a release date may be imminent. 

The news follows rating board confirmations in other parts of the world, too, including Brazil and Australia, and a leak of Skull &amp; Bones&#x27; four-minute tutorial video back in April, which Ubisoft eventually confirmed was real.

The description shared on the ESRB website is the closest we&#x27;ve come to getting an idea of what the game - which is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox Series - entails since it underwent &quot;extensive reworking&quot; a couple of years back.

That&#x27;s according to Dealabs poster billbil-kun, who - as ever - has the scoop on what titles are next heading to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus free game line-up next month. 

Though we have to take this with the usual pinch of proverbial salt, billbil-kun has been ahead of Sony&#x27;s formal announcement many, many times now, and hasn&#x27;t been wrong thus far.

                              <span>Riot Games has confirmed that from 13th July, it will begin collecting &quot;in-game voice communications&quot; in North America in a bid to combat &quot;disruptive behaviour&quot;.

In a brief update on Valorant&#x27;s offical website, Riot Games explained that as part of its &quot;larger effort to combat disruptive behaviour&quot;, the company has updated its Privacy Notice and Terms of Service to allow recording and evaluation of in-game voice communications.

The post stresses that these recordings will only be evaluated when &quot;a report for [negative] behaviour is submitted&quot; and the system will originally kick off in Valorant before - once the &quot;tech [is] in a good enough place&quot; - it will be rolled out to other games.

                              <span>Former Sega of America president and founding member of Sony Computer Entertainment America, Bernie Stolar, has died aged 75 years old. 

According to GamesBeat, Stolar - whose career started in 1980 when he set up his own coin-op arcade company - died in California. He had always been a very candid and transparent executive who talked openly about his triumphs and mistakes over the years.

&quot;I loved working for Sony,&quot; Stolar once said, according to GB. &quot;I really did. But when the opportunity came up to go to Sega and help rebuild the business and come up with new hardware, I was very interested in doing it. I wouldn’t have left Sony if I hadn’t also lived in fear of getting fired along with everyone else, though.

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has outlined its plans on tackling cheating in the popular augmented-reality mobile game.

In an update posted to the company&#x27;s official blog (thanks, NME), Niantic said it is &quot;continuously work[ing] to facilitate a fun and fair environment&quot; and &quot;[felt players&#x27;] frustration about how cheating behaviours&quot; affected them. 

Its last post on cheating - posted way back last year - was &quot;focused primarily on sharing a broad overview&quot; on the topic, but since then, Niantic says it&#x27;s &quot;becoming better&quot; at spotting cheaters.

Whilst it&#x27;s &quot;mostly a modding-focused update&quot;, creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone says there &quot;will be some new content&quot;, but advised players to temper expectations, as it &quot;won&#x27;t be huge&quot;.

Asked if his follow-up game, Haunted Chocolatier, will have references to the wholesome farming sim, Barone said that there would be, but said he didn&#x27;t know &quot;how deep the connection will be&quot; as he&#x27;s keen for his upcoming title to &quot;have its own identity&quot;.

Nacho Requena - editor of Spanish games magazine, Manual - teased in a recent Twitch stream that new announcements - this time from major publishers about third-party games - is slated for this coming Tuesday, 28th June 2022.

&quot;We should have a Nintendo Direct this coming Tuesday,&quot; Requena reportedly said, as translated by VGC. &quot;This will be mainly focused on third-party games – that’s what I’ve been told to expect.

As spotted by Gematsu (thanks, PC Gamer), back in 2018, studio boss Hidetaka Miyazaki said that &quot;3.5&quot; of the games the team was currently working on were unannounced, and 4Gamer reached out to ask Miyazaki on their progress. 

Since that time, we&#x27;ve had Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, PSVR game, Déraciné, and Elden Ring, of course. That leaves just one mysterious game yet to be announced, which may or may not be that heavily-rumoured Armored Core instalment.

According to  Michsuzuki and spotted and translated by our friends at VGC, Square Enix&#x27;s CEO Yosuke Matsuda confirmed at the company&#x27;s recent Shareholders&#x27; Meeting that it was &quot;too early to make Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy blockchain games&quot;, emphasising that he was &quot;not thinking about that&quot; for upcoming releases. 

VGC also purports that the company is keen to create &quot;story-focused&quot; NFTs, too.

The USB controller is based upon the Cyber Stick and offers analogue controls for compatible games on Sega&#x27;s diminutive system. As demonstrated in yesterday&#x27;s announcement livestream, like its 90s predecessor, it&#x27;ll feature a throttle, stick, and the ability to suit both right- and left-handed players. 

The Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 itself will retail for around half the price of this newly-announced peripheral (thanks, Famitsu).

                              <span>Earlier this month, I and others wrote a letter to Congress, basically saying that cryptocurrencies are an complete and total disaster, and urging them to regulate the space. Nothing in that letter is out of the ordinary, and is in line with what I wrote about blockchain in 2019. In response, Matthew Green has written—not really a rebuttal—but a “a general response to some of the more common spurious objections…people make to public blockchain systems.” In it, he makes several broad points:
Yes, current proof-of-work blockchains like bitcoin are terrible for the environment. But there are other modes like proof-of-stake that are not.

                              <span>Bungie and a number of PlayStation studios, including Insoniac and Sucker Punch, have spoken out in support of reproductive rights following today&#x27;s decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn key legislation granting individuals the constitutional right to choose an abortion - a move that gives US states the power to either severely restrict or ban the practice.


Bungie was one of the first studios to make a statement in May after the US Supreme Court&#x27;s plans to overthrow Roe v Wade were leaked to the press, calling the move a &quot;direct attack on human rights&quot;. Adding to that sentiment in a new statement shared today, it said, &quot;Standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values.&quot;


&quot;Last month, we stated without reservation that all of us deserve to choose our own path and access the healthcare we need,&quot; the developer continued. &quot;The decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade cuts off millions of Americans from that access and leaves open the possibility of even further restrictions on life-saving healthcare for all of us.&quot;

Right at the bottom of the catalogue is a section called &quot;Last chance to play&quot;. Currently there are two games listed: PS4 game Shadow Warrior 3 and PS3 game Syberia.


The former is set to leave the Extra catalogue on 5th July 2022 - although it&#x27;s been on PS Now since 1st March - while the latter will leave Premium on 19th July 2022.

                              <span>The first trailer for Final Fantasy 16 introduced lead characters Clive and Joshua, as well as a cute dog. Now, that dog has a name.


Producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed to IGN that the dog is named Torgal and he may even be a party member.


&quot;Well, let&#x27;s just say he&#x27;s more wolf than dog - and his name is &#x27;Torgal&#x27;,&quot; said Yoshida. &quot;As for him being a party member, you&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. We&#x27;ll have more info on parties soon.&quot;

                              <span>Bungie is suing the perpetrator behind a series of fake Destiny 2 DMCA takedowns for $7.7m.


Earlier in March this year, a number of top Destiny 2 YouTubers - and even Bungie itself - were struck with a fake DMCA takedown from an unknown user.


Bungie has since identified and filed a lawsuit against the user, named Nicholas Minor a.k.a Lord Nazo.

                              <span>Sony has revealed a new trailer to hail in the arrival of its new look PS Plus subscription service across the globe. And, of course, the company has not missed out on a golden opportunity to remind us all of its many IPs, from Horizon and Uncharted to Bloodborne, Ghost of Tsushima and more. 
The new trailer, which is simply called Mr. Malcom, takes us on a journey into a &quot;mystifying and intriguing world, showcasing the lives that anyone can live, through wonderful gaming experiences&quot;. It all starts off seemingly benign, with the titular Mr Malcom enjoying a meal out before buying himself some nice juicy meat from the butcher. 
However, it soon becomes more and more surreal, as Mr. Malcom makes his way home and back to his eclectic collection. Also, that meat I just mentioned... it wasn&#x27;t actually for him. You can check out the trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has admitted the recent trailer for the game was delayed due to the war in Ukraine.


Speaking to Japanese site Dengeki Online (spotted by VGC), Yoshida feared the subject matter of the game would be inappropriate due to ongoing world events.


&quot;Actually, it was ready to be released in March, but at the same time, Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine made the world situation unstable,&quot; said Yoshida.

Players who wish to see another player banned due to misconduct will have to send a ban request to Mojang. This will need to include a valid reason for the request.

However, it has replaced a fan-created version that&#x27;s now available only as an add-on, meaning it&#x27;s impossible to access without purchasing the Nightdive Studios edition first.

A recent company filing revealed Yves Guillemot chose to forgo about a third of his annual compensation (via Axios), equating to a pay cut of €310k (approximately £266k / $327k). 
An Ubisoft spokesperson told Axios this was a &quot;personal decision by Yves Guillemot, which he took considering that the company had not reached the financial targets that it had publicly communicated to the markets&quot;.

                              <span>One of the developers of the recently released Sonic Origins has hit out at publisher Sega, alleging &quot;what is in Origins is also not what we turned in&quot;.

Simon &quot;Stealth&quot; Thomley, of Sonic Origins developer Headcannon, took to Twitter to accuse Sega of introducing &quot;wild bugs&quot; into the game. 


Headcannon was responsible for the well-received 2017 platformer Sonic Mania and assisted Sega with the development of Sonic Origins, which was released on multiple platforms this week.

                              <span>Developer 343 Industries has announced it is considering adding purchasable &quot;Spartan Points&quot; to Halo: Master Chief Collection in the future.
The idea is that these new Spartan Points will take the place of the Season Points that currently exist in the game, and which allow players to purchase various cosmetics by completing challenges and the like.
Don&#x27;t worry unduly, however.

                              <span>Actor Chris Pratt has been discussing his - somewhat controversial - role in the upcoming CGI Super Mario Bros. movie, telling Variety that his take on the title character will be &quot;updated and unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world before.&quot;


Mario has, of course, been voiced by Charles Martinet since 1992, and his video game performance has become inseparable from Nintendo&#x27;s flagship character. As such, Mario fans were somewhat aghast last year when Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto announced Pratt would be replacing Martinet as the voice of Mario in the upcoming film.


It&#x27;s a casting decision that few seemed to have warmed to even ten months on, despite the best efforts of Chris Meledandri, producer of the Super Mario film, who insisted Pratt&#x27;s performance as Mario was &quot;phenomenal&quot; last November. Meledandri then defended his star again this week, saying criticism of Pratt&#x27;s casting would &quot;evaporate&quot; when people heard his performance.

                              <span>Four and a bit years after its initial launch, FTL developer Subset Games is revisiting its stellar turn-based strategy game Into the Breach, with a much-expanded Advanced Edition update for existing platforms that&#x27;s set to release on 19th July.


Into the Breach&#x27;s Advanced Edition update - which will be free to all existing owners on Switch, Mac, and PC - introduces new squads, weapons, pilots (with new pilot abilities), enemies, bosses, missions, and new music from Ben Prunty. It&#x27;ll also include a new, more challenging difficulty mode, plus support for seven new languages.


Alongside the update for existing platforms, Into the Breach will also be making its iOS and Android debut on 19th July. This version will include the new Advanced Edition content and touch-screen support, but will only be available to Netflix subscribers as part of the streaming service&#x27;s gradual move into gaming.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the majestic rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, is expanding again, this time introduing a huge number of new accessibility features, including an adjustable assist mode, in a PC and console update the studios are calling Breaking Barriers.


Evil Empire first discussed improving Dead Cells&#x27; accessibility back in January, when it began canvassing players for feedback on how it could expand the game to better suit a wide range of needs. It then shared an update on its progress in May, detailing some of the accessibility options that were on the way.


After a round of beta testing, all that work has now been moved to the live game with the official launch of Breaking Barriers. The update brings an huge range of new accessibility features - tested by a panel of players with various disabilities at AbleGamers - all of which have been detailed in a lengthy new blog post and nine-minute video breakdown.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - we look in detail at today&#x27;s final rollout of PlayStation Plus Premium, which is now available in the UK and mainland Europe.

We now know all of the games included in the PlayStation Plus Premium catalogue at launch and it&#x27;s enough to hit Sony&#x27;s promises, certainly, though there are still odd omissions. The lack of 60Hz for some PS1 games (for now) also points to a rather rushed release, despite the extra weeks we&#x27;ve waited on these shores.

So, what can Sony do to build on this launch and improve the new PlayStation Plus Premium further? And, after all that, have we ended up subscribing ourselves? Eurogamer&#x27;s Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

A cloud-only version will also be available for Nintendo Switch, and as previously announced the game will launch into Xbox Game Pass for Xbox, PC and cloud on day one.


Today also brings 10 minutes of newly-revealed gameplay, as siblings Amicia and Hugo return, happy to use their tricks to remove any soldiers in sight. It&#x27;s a nice showcase of the game&#x27;s stealthy combat, if nothing else, and yes - those rats are back.

&quot;Xbox has been supporting keyboard and mouse for a few years now, and we&#x27;re working on adding it to streaming for PC users,&quot; explained Microsoft&#x27;s Morgan Brown in a new game dev video (via The Verge). &quot;But you can start adding it to your game right now and your console keyboard and mouse users will appreciate it. It will light up in streaming once we&#x27;ve finished adding it.&quot;

As announced previously, Overwatch 2 will not contain any loot boxes, with items instead made available for purchase directly instead. 


Writing in a reddit AMA last night, Blizzard explained that any unopened loot boxes would be automatically redeemed ahead of Overwatch 2&#x27;s launch.

&quot;Does Sonic Origins Sonic 3 have a different song?&quot; he tweeted out of the blue. &quot;Oh my god, the music for Sonic 3 has changed, even though Sega Official uses Michael Jackson&#x27;s music.&quot;

                              <span>If an entire universe in the palm of your hand sounds neat, you&#x27;re probably already excited about the launch of exploratory space sim No Man&#x27;s Sky on Switch. And it turns out the wait for its arrival won&#x27;t go on too much longer, with developer Hello Games having now confirmed it&#x27;ll be coming to Nintendo&#x27;s console - initially as a single-player-only experience - on 7th October.


No Man&#x27;s Sky, of course, launched for PC and PS4 back in the summer of 2016, giving players an entire procedural universe to explore as their whims took them. That initial version memorably came in for some criticism, but Hello Games has continued to expand on the game&#x27;s solid survival core since then, delivering over 19, often significant, free updates.


These have introduced the likes of base building, bobbleheads, farming, giant customisable space freighters, land and water vehicles, pilotable mechs, living ships, alien-infested space derelicts, new flora and fauna, pets, live-service-style community expeditions, music tools, sand worms, and more - all of which should be included at launch on Switch.

The game, which is known as Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City - The Board Game, comes from a collaboration with CMON, whose other works include Zombicide, Blood Rage, The Others, Rising Sun, Massive Darkness and Arcadia Quest, to name but a few. 
It sees up to four players taking on the role of the ruthless gangs vying for control in the &quot;glittering hellhole&quot; of Night City (much as the name suggests).

                              <span>Twitch is testing a new UI layout intended to boost discoverability, but the reaction so far is mixed.


At present, viewing the different game categories on Twitch brings up a grid view of various streams that need to be clicked on individually to view.


The new version being tested adds a video at the top which auto-plays as users click through the grid of streams beneath, before choosing to join the stream or follow the streamer.

And that&#x27;s not all. The developer has also revealed that those who purchase the Taiko Drum Set edition will not only get the base game but the playable drums as well (ok, the clue was in the title with that one).

                              <span>Sony has exceeded the number of games made available as part of its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogues by a decent margin.


Fans had been eyeing the service&#x27;s slow roll-out over the course of the past month through different countries around the world - until its final deployment in the UK and mainland Europe today. 


Ahead of time, Sony had promised &quot;up to 400&quot; PlayStation 4 and PS5 games would be available to both PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers - though the initial launch in Asia fell well short. Eurogamer&#x27;s list of PS4 and PS5 games available today comes to 429.

                              <span>Elden Ring has already inspired countless mods and fan videos, including a playable demake on a Game Boy.




Now, Youtube channel 64 Bits has released a demake video of what Elden Ring would look like on a SNES. Spoiler: it looks fantastic.


Of course, it takes a top-down viewpoint akin to classic RPGs (the video notes Secret of Mana, Terranigma, and Final Fantasy 6 as inspiration), with a cute little Tarnished defeating various iconic bosses with melee weapons and magic.

                              <span>We know Sonic goes fast - he is, after all, a blue spikey blur of a hedgehog more often than not. But now, he has sped past one of his most impressive milestones yet and made Paramount a cool $400m at the box office. 
The film is currently the eighth-biggest film launch worldwide this year, but, as Deadline reports, this place is likely to jump up a few notches with the film still to release in both Hong Kong and Japan. 
These numbers are a pretty impressive sight, but perhaps not unexpected. After all, Sonic 2 reportedly enjoyed the greatest opening weekend for any video-game based movie ever on its release in April.

                              <span>PSP classic Super Stardust Portable has been quietly added to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Premium games list, though is currently a little difficult to find. 


The handheld shoot &#x27;em-up, originally launched in 2008, can be found by searching directly for the title in the PlayStation Store (thanks to reddit user Turb0_Thunder).


You won&#x27;t find it (yet) via the Classic Catalogue menu, although it&#x27;s unclear if this is because it&#x27;s not due to go live yet, or a deliberate secret. (Either way, PlayStation&#x27;s store interface isn&#x27;t the clearest to filter and search through.)

However, many of its Classic Catalogue PlayStation 1 games are available only in their PAL 50Hz versions - a slower standard superceded by the NTSC 60Hz option available elsewhere. 


This morning, Sony said it will provide &quot;NTSC options for a majority&quot; of these games in the future - though not detailed when or for which games.

Abstract: In recent decades, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which develops cryptographic standards for non-national security agencies of the U.S. government, has emerged as the de facto international source for cryptographic standards. But in 2013, Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency had subverted the integrity of a NIST cryptographic standard­the Dual_EC_DRBG­enabling easy decryption of supposedly secured communications. This discovery reinforced the desire of some public and private entities to develop their own cryptographic standards instead of relying on a U.S. government process. Yet, a decade later, no credible alternative to NIST has emerged. NIST remains the only viable candidate for effectively developing internationally trusted cryptography standards...</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good while since Square Enix&#x27;s troubled live-service action-adventure Marvel&#x27;s Avengers got itself a new playable hero - its most recent addition was the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man at the end of last year - but that drought will finally come to an end next Tuesday, 28th June, with the arrival of Jane Foster&#x27;s Mighty Thor.


When developer Crystal Dynamics first confirmed Foster was to be Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; next playable hero, the studio said the character would have &quot;a lot in common&quot; with the version of Thor already in-game, albeit with &quot;elements that are distinctly Jane&quot;.


Crystal Dynamics has since expanded on that, revealing Foster will arrive with a few new baseline abilities setting her apart from Odinson, including a new ranged combo and new ranged power attack. There&#x27;s also her new Intrinsic ability (All-Mother&#x27;s Blessing), a new Overcharge ability (God Tempest), and a new Ultimate ability (All-Weapon) enabling her to smite foes using both the Undrjarn and Mjölnir.

                              <span>Despite running into some considerable set-backs shortly after its initial announcement, leading to an indefinite delay, developer Nightdive Studios&#x27; highly anticipated remaster of Westwood Studio&#x27;s classic Blade Runner point-and-click adventure is finally complete, and will be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, tomorrow, 23rd June.


The Blade Runner game, for those unfamiliar, released in 1997, and, unlike the vast majority of licensed adaptations, was an extraordinary piece of work, not only managing to perfectly capture the neon-streaked dystopian atmosphere of the movie in a story that ran parallel to its action, but doing so in ways both wildly ambitious and legitimately groundbreaking.


Although Blade Runner takes its cue from narrative-driven point-and-click games, it immediately distinguishes itself from its genre peers by sending players, in the role of Blade Runner Ray McCoy, on a heavily randomised adventure. The goal remains the same each play-through, in that players must use their investigatory skills to identify and hunt down a number of replicants, but exactly which characters are replicants is determined at the start of a new game, subtly changing their behaviour as the story unfolds.

                              <span>Developer Creative Assembly has finally unmasked Hyenas, its long-in-the-works sci-fi shooter - and while Alien Isolation fans might be a little disappointed to see it&#x27;s not a much-hoped for successor, anyone who&#x27;s ever dreamed of doing heists in a space should be very cheerful.


Creative Assembly first revealed it was working on a sci-fi shooter back in September 2018, calling it an &quot;ambitious multiplayer title&quot; and a &quot;fresh take on the FPS genre&quot; that would enable players to &quot;embrace a variety of creative playstyles&quot;. Almost four years later, that project has now been named as Hyenas, a &quot;ballsy entry into the most competitive genre in gaming&quot;.


&quot;In Hyenas, the world is broken... literally,&quot; explains Creative Assembly. &quot;The billionaires have finally made it to Mars, leaving Earth and those tax bills far behind. The zero-gravity tech that powered their journey has shattered our planet, abandoning us in a drifting slum called the &#x27;Taint&#x27;. The only thing the rich care for is rare Merch, pop culture swag from the lives we left behind, which they loot from the rubble to furnish their Martian mansions.&quot;

                              <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic has said it has no current plans to remove the option of battling in raids from afar - a popular mechanic introduced in response to Covid lockdowns. 


Some fans had feared the concept would be cut - as other pandemic-era bonuses and gameplay have already been - especially as Niantic recently announced a new in-person only raid variety, which will debut this weekend for the game&#x27;s next Community Day.


&quot;That&#x27;s a unique experience that we&#x27;re setting up just for these extra bonuses in Community Day,&quot; Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka told me today, referring to the bonuses players will get to extend their local Community Day experience by taking part in the game&#x27;s new in-person-only event raids.

                              <span>An Elden Ring player has accidentally stumbled on an unknown - and invisible - boss thanks to a randomiser mod.


YouTuber MythyMoo used an item and boss randomiser mod that mixes up the placement of acquired items and bosses, which can massively impact the difficulty of a run. The mod also mixes up the names of each boss.


Except, as PCGamesN reports, things took a turn when MythyMoo arrived in the Consecrated Snowfield, an area with various field bosses.

Youtuber Vadim M found the code buried in the recently remastered  Vice City: Definitive Edition.


What&#x27;s interesting is that the code isn&#x27;t on the original retail copy of the game, hence why it was only just discovered.

                              <span>The Epic Games Store has launched its own version of user reviews and tags, via randomised game ratings and polls it hopes will avoid the kinds of review bombing seen frequently on Steam. 


The ability to rate a game on a five-star scale will be randomly offered to owners of that title who have played it for more than two hours. 


&quot;Because these requests are randomised, we won&#x27;t spam our players, and we probably won&#x27;t ask about every game or app used,&quot; Epic Games&#x27; Craig Pearson explained. &quot;This approach protects games from review bombing and ensures people assigning scores are actual players of the games.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo presented a deep dive into the imminent JRPG epic Xenoblade Chronicles in today&#x27;s focussed Direct presentation, revealing an expansion pass that unlocks helpful items and outfits upon the game&#x27;s release next month and that will provide access to a new story scenario that&#x27;s set to launch before the end of 2023. 


There was plenty more shown off, with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 thankfully dialling back some of the anime excesses of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - there was not a single improbably proportioned sidekick to be seen - while restoring some of the scale and wonder of Xenoblade Chronicles X. 


Set on the planet of Aionios, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set against a backdrop of warring factions from the nations of Keves and Agnos, and a world in which people have pre-determined lifespans of 10 years. Your party is drawn from three characters from each side who&#x27;ve put their differences aside - and opening up a broader, deeper take on combat that&#x27;s rich with systems.

Some players take their cosmetic inventory very seriously, which they can buy and sell for hundreds of pounds.


Now one unfortunate collector claims their entire inventory - worth an estimated $2m - has been stolen by hackers (thanks, PCGamesN).

                              <span>Red Bull Racing has suspended junior driver Juri Vips after he used a racial slur while streaming on Twitch.


On Monday, Vips streamed Call of Duty: Warzone with fellow Red Bull junior driver Liam Lawson. As has been clipped, Vips cursed and said the n-word, to which Lawson replied &quot;Juri!&quot; and laughed.


Lawson also asked Vips to wear a pink Red Bull cap, to which he replied &quot;No, that&#x27;s gay&quot;. Lawson responded: &quot;Juri, you can&#x27;t say that&quot;.

                              <span>Pokémon Go will add its first new Pokéball in years, and it&#x27;s a fan-favourite design from the Nintendo Switch games Pokémon Sun and Moon.


The Beast Ball is a galactic-looking version of the regular Pokéball designed specifically for capturing Ultra Beasts, the extra-dimensional creatures which featured in Sun and Moon (and most recently arrived in Pokémon Go) via creepy wormholes.


Players at Pokémon Go&#x27;s three big in-person gatherings in Berlin, Seattle and Sapporo this summer will be first to use Beast Balls over the next six weeks, and get first access to one of the next three Ultra Beasts to arrive.

                              <span>After last season&#x27;s King Kong x Godzilla battle, Activision&#x27;s flagship battle royale gets even wackier with an appearance of The Terminator. 


Better yet, you&#x27;re spoiled for choice, with Season four of Warzone giving you the option to play as the orginal T-800 or its succesor the T-1000 (Schwarzenegger voice lines not included).


Activision being Activision, the two Terminators are not bundled together, but rather as seperate time-limited packs.

Watkins Glen International is a staple of the US racing scene, playing host to F1 until it was deemed unsafe after a series of fatal accidents. It&#x27;s a ramshackle kind of place that now plays host to the likes of IMSA and NASCAR, and it&#x27;s an absolute delight to drive either of the configurations that are on offer in Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s take on the track. 


There&#x27;s a trio of new cars too, with a brace of Suzukis including a new fictional &#x27;Vision&#x27; car alongside the iconic V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special (now how about putting Pikes Peak in the game, seeing as Gran Turismo&#x27;s been squatting on the official licence for the legendary course for a while?).

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 will include party members in combat, despite the fact that recent trailers have focused solely on protagonist Clive.


Fans have speculated whether other characters will join battles, which producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed to IGN - although they will remain AI-controlled.


&quot;We didn&#x27;t want to overwhelm users in our newest trailer, so we focused solely on Clive&#x27;s battles. That said, for most of his journey, Clive will be accompanied by one or more companions. These companions will participate in battle, as well as trade banter with Clive. That said, the party members will be AI-driven so as to allow players to focus solely on controlling Clive,&quot; said Yoshida.

In a PlayStation Blog interview, the Final Fantasy 16 producer describes how he was honoured to be offered the opportunity to work on a single-player game in the series, but thought fans may criticise him.



&quot;I said &#x27;Thanks, but I have my hands full with Final Fantasy 14, so let me think about it.&#x27; I was truly honoured that the company would choose my section, Creative Business Unit 3, to be responsible for making the next entry in the FF series. But, as you probably know, I&#x27;m already the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14. I was worried that if I took on the directorship of 16, too, fans of both games would have good reason to believe I wasn&#x27;t giving either project my full attention,&quot; said Yoshida.

Doubling down on its commitment to the Battlefield franchise - and fixing the recent embattled Battlefield 2042 in particular - DICE has ruled out a return for any of its other franchises for now.


Speaking to Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, DICE&#x27;s recently-appointed general manager Rebecka Coutaz confirmed any project such as Mirror&#x27;s Edge was currently sat on the backburner.

                              <span>Forza Horizon 5 got a hefty new patch which adds two of the most requested features for Xbox and PC players alike. 


Players can now finally start Horizon Stories with friends in co-op, a feature that was strangely omitted from the game at launch and even stranger given the social nature of the game. 


Previously, players in a convoy would be booted off when the host starts a story mission.

                              <span>PlayStation is the latest big company to announce it will skip Gamescom this year. 


The annual European show, held in Cologne, was traditionally the world&#x27;s largest in terms of visitors. This summer will see Gamescom return as a physical event for the first time since 2019, albeit with fewer publishers in attendance. 

PlayStation confirmed its decision to skip Gamescom 2022 in a statement to German publication Games Wirtschaft (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz), where it also confirmed it would not feature any announcements in the show&#x27;s Geoff Keighley-fronted livestream Opening Night Live.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 will not have an open world.


Producer Naoki Yoshida confirmed the news in an interview with IGN, although he said that recent open world games have provided &quot;inspiration&quot;.


&quot;We&#x27;ve found in our extensive user research that many of the younger generation of gamers have never played a Final Fantasy or don&#x27;t have any interest in the series. To create a game that might excite and resonate not only with our core fans, but also with that new generation, we played a lot of games ourselves, and so yes, in [Final Fantasy 16] you&#x27;ll find inspiration from recent triple-A open world RPGs,&quot; said Yoshida.

                              <span>Yesterday, players were left unable to find matches in Fall Guys thanks to server issues sparked by the game&#x27;s multiplatform relaunch. 


Developer Mediatonic first acknowledged the issues yesterday afternoon, in a fashionably Fall Guys-style tweet.


Late last night, things seemed to be improving, with more players able to get into game. But still there were  &quot;teething issues&quot;, as servers were flooded with new players across PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

A &quot;peaceful protest&quot; to &quot;#SaveTF2&quot; was organised by fans in May to raise awareness of the game&#x27;s many bugs, its ongoing bot problems, and the general lack of updates by Valve despite TF2&#x27;s ongoing popularity.


In response, Valve said it had heard the game&#x27;s community. &quot;We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things,&quot; it wrote shortly after.

Producer Naoki Yoshida has spoken in multiple interviews about the game, divulging new information about its conception.


&quot;When it came to deciding what to do with Final Fantasy 16, I thought back to when I played the original Final Fantasy, and remembered how I felt like I was playing the leading role in a motion picture,&quot; he said in a new PlayStation Blog post.

                              <span>Interesting:
What makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware that we usually come across, is that it needs to infect other running processes to inflict damage on infected machines. Instead of being a standalone executable file that is run to infect a machine, it is a shared object (SO) library that is loaded into all running processes using LD_PRELOAD (T1574.006), and parasitically infects the machine. Once it has infected all the running processes, it provides the threat actor with rootkit functionality, the ability to harvest credentials, and remote access capability...</span>

                              <span>Following its conspicuously release-window-free unveiling back in April, Blizzard has now confirmed World of Warcraft&#x27;s Dragonflight expansion will launch later this year.


Dragonflight, as detailed in Blizzard&#x27;s April reveal stream, will give players access to the long-hidden ancestral home of dragonkind, known as the Dragon Isles, introducing four new areas - the Waking Shores starting zone, Ohn’ahran Plains, Azure Span, and Thaldraszus - complete with new dungeons and raids.


Dragonflight also adds the Dracthyr Evokers - a new playable race-class hybrid that can, depending on a players&#x27; chosen class specialisations, focus on either damage dealing or healing - plus a new skill-based flight system tied to customisable dragon companions.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve a proposal that the company should publish an annual report detailing the effectiveness and outcomes of its efforts to prevent abuse, harassment, and discrimination in its workplace - a non-binding vote Activision has, as yet, only said it will &quot;carefully consider&quot;.


The proposal, originally raised by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in February, requested that Activision publically release an annual report detailing several key metrics: the total number of pending sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes or ligation; details of the company&#x27;s progress toward reducing the average time it takes to resolve sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination complaints; the amount of money it has spent settling disputes related to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, and finally pay and hours worked consolidated data.


While this kind of transparency might seem prudent given the shocking allegations that have surfaced in relation to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s workplace practices over the last year, and given that the publisher remains embroiled in a number of lawsuits relating to those practices - including last July&#x27;s State of California filing, which called the company a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - the company&#x27;s board of directors instead wrote to shareholders in May unanimously urging them to vote against the proposal.

                              <span>After more than five years of development, Redbeet Interactive&#x27;s enormously enjoyable open water survival adventure Raft has just received its full version 1.0 release, bringing, among other things, the final chunk of its exploratory story campaign.


Raft, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, first started to attract attention as a free prototype on itch.io back in 2016. Redbeet steadily expanded on that version&#x27;s core survival loop - in which players start out on a tiny wooden raft in the middle of the ocean, hooking up foods, supplies, and building materials until their tiny vessel is a veritable sea-faring palace - in preparation for a commercial early access release on Steam, which finally arrived in 2018.


Since then, Redbeet has continued to build on that early feature set, introducing the likes of online co-op, explorable islands, underwater reefs, crop growing, cooking, animal care, and even a full story campaign in which players can learn more about the flooded world.

                              <span>Planet Zoo&#x27;s steady stream of post-launch DLC continues today with the arrival of its 11th paid expansion, the eco-themed Conservation Pack, on Steam, introducing a selection of new, endangered animals, new scenery items, and more.


On the animal front, Planet Zoo&#x27;s Conservation Pack brings five new additions - Przewalski&#x27;s horse, amur leopard, scimitar-horned oryx, siamang, and axolotl - all of which are considered at-risk species as a result of climate change, poaching, and habitat degradation.


Elsewhere, the DLC introduces a new scenario challenging players to assist the Turtlerock Wildlife Orphanage, inspired by Mongolia&#x27;s Gorkhi Terelj National Park, by rescuing, raising, documenting and releasing as many species as possible. Renewable energy, plant diversity, and sustainability will be an important focus too.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eyeing up Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands but have been disinclined to purchase it during its Epic Games Store exclusivity period, you might like to know it&#x27;s making the leap to Steam this Thursday, 23rd June.


Released on Epic, PlayStation, and Xbox in March, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands takes the tabletop-inspired action of Borderlands 2&#x27;s much-loved DLC episode Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep and spins it out into a full-sized game of first-person fantasy adventuring.


The game-within-a-game premise casts players as an unnamed &quot;newbie&quot; in the real, Borderlands world who&#x27;s taking part in a D&amp;D-like game called Bunkers and Badasses. Several celebrity-voiced friends are along for the ride, as is the irrepressible Tina, as Dungeon Master.

                              <span>Microsoft has confirmed a shortage of Xbox controllers in the UK as major retailers have sold out of stock.


As VGC reports, the official Microsoft Store currently has no controllers available in any colour, while retailers GAME, Smyths, Argos and Currys also have no stock.

Amazon UK does have the Carbon Black controller in stock at the time of writing, but third-party prices for a new (not used) controller start at £93.99 (official price is £54.99).

Out today are the Shadowrun Trilogy on cloud and console, and Total War: Three Kingdoms on PC. The former is a cyberpunk tactical RPG series, while the latter is a Chinese take on the multi award-winning strategy series.


Then, 23rd June brings two more titles: FIFA 2022 (console and PC) and mythical action game Naraka: Bladepoint (cloud, console, PC).

                              <span>The rights to Steam hit Spintires - as well as the fate of millions of dollars in revenue for spin-off sequels Mudrunner and Snowrunner - are the focus of several major legal claims between Saber Interactive and the game&#x27;s original publisher Oovee, Eurogamer can reveal. 


The increasingly bitter fight between the two companies escalated significantly last week with the issuing of a press release by a legal firm associated with Oovee containing numerous claims directed at Saber, and the brief return of Spintires to Steam despite its previous delisting in the wake of another legal challenge. 


Saber has subsequently filed a defamation claim in relation to Oovee&#x27;s allegations, Eurogamer can also reveal, while Spintires&#x27; Steam page is now back offline pending various DMCA challenges.

A tweet from the Nintendo Japan account states that the iOS version of the app will be updated in &quot;summer 2022&quot; and will only be compatible with iOS version 14.0 or later.


It therefore won&#x27;t be available on iOS version 13.0 or earlier, according to a rough translation of the tweet.

                              <span>EA&#x27;s Battlefield 2042 has attracted its fair share of controversy since it launched last November, with players unhappy with the omission of key features at launch as well as some questionable design decisions which resulted in fan backlash. 


There have been updates since release that have corrected the course of Battlefield 2042, with the belated launch of its first season earlier this month introducing a new map and features that have gone down well with the game&#x27;s community. 


Despite these updates, however, Battlefield 2042 still has players fighting under a Russian flag as one of the two factions in the game - a decision that sits uncomfortably given the invasion of Ukraine from Russian forces, and in light of EA&#x27;s decision to remove Russian clubs and the Russian national football team from FIFA 22, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online.

On the tiniest LCD screen I&#x27;ve ever seen, here&#x27;s Doom running inside a single Lego brick.


Brilliantly, this brick is a Lego element typically used as a computer screen, with the insides hollowed out to insert a miniature circuit and LCD display.

The choice of Hollywood hunk Pratt - star of Marvel, Jurassic World - as Mario raised eyebrows among many fans when it was first announced. 


Now, Chris Meledandri, boss of Mario and Minions animation studio Illumination, has responded.

                              <span>Sony is reportedly discontinuing PS Plus retail cards from stores ahead of the launch of its revamped subscription service.


The cards have been available to top up PS Plus membership for one, three, or 12 months, but as spotted by Polish site XGP they&#x27;re no longer available.



The move coincides with the launch of Sony&#x27;s new subscription service this week, which has multiple price tiers - making the old retail cards somewhat obsolete.

                              <span>Many were left disappointed when a new Silent Hill game was not announced during the not-E3-but-sort-of showcases over the last few weeks. However, for those that are keen for more thrills (and bloody spills) in its horror-filled world, fear not, as fans have your backs. 
A remake of the original Silent Hill is currently being made in Unreal Engine 5 by a group called Codeless Games (via DSO Gaming). And not only is it in development, but we have also been given a peak at 10 minutes of gameplay that focuses on Midwich Elementary School (a major building that protagonist Harry Mason explores in a bid to find his missing daughter). 
This project does a pretty good job at setting the scene and overall atmosphere.

However, these plans were scuppered when Activision merged developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard - a move which saw the studio re-named to Blizzard Albany and re-emerge as a support studio for the Diablo franchise and other Blizzard titles.


Hawk spoke of the now-scrapped plans in detail for the first time last night, while a guest on a fan Twitch livestream.

Aspyr released a remaster of the Xbox title on Switch last month, with cut content due out in Q3 this year as DLC.



However, a game crash occurs after the Basilisk Crash cutscene when landing on Onderon, which Aspyr is working to fix.

                              <span>PlayStation 5 may be a lot of things to a lot of different people, but one thing most would probably agree on is that it&#x27;s a bloody big console. Now, however, one enterprising YouTuber has taken up the challenge of downsizing the machine to create the &quot;world&#x27;s first PS5 Slim console&quot; - one that&#x27;s less than 2cm thick.


The project is the work of YouTube channel DIY Perks, which specialises in videos about designing and building gadgets and technology at home, and begins with a tear-down of Sony&#x27;s behemoth console to figure exactly which of its innards should stay and wish can go to hit that 2cm target.


Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the PS5&#x27;s bulk comes from its steel shrouding and CPU-cooling heatsink, and with those gone, DIY Perk&#x27;s target seems a little closer to reality. Ultimately, to hit that magic number, PS5&#x27;s existing cooling solution is replaced with a custom water-channeling system made from copper sheeting. It&#x27;s not a cheap option, costing an eyewatering $240 for the sheeting alone, but it appears to do the job.

                              <span>As the launch of its first major expansion approaches, Outriders - developer People Can Fly&#x27;s enjoyable third-person sci-fi shooter - is free to try on Steam this week, giving new players an opportunity to see what they&#x27;re missing.


Outriders launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation last April, delivering a slice of co-operative shooter action that Eurogamer reviewer Vikki Blake enjoyed, albeit with some caveats. &quot;For some,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I suspect Outriders doesn&#x27;t innovate enough to stand out from an already oversaturated shooter market, relying too much on the ideas of other, stronger titles that have come before it.&quot;


&quot;[But] as a die-hard Guardian and card-carrying fangirl of the genre,&quot; Vikki continued, &quot;Outriders tickles me in all the right places. Offering gunplay that feels solid and satisfying and an array of additional powers and abilities to keep combat fresh and exciting, I can only admit that Outriders has surprised me in all the right ways. Maybe it&#x27;ll surprise you, too.&quot;

                              <span>Northgard developer Shiro Games&#x27;  sci-fi strategy game Dune: Spice Wars now includes multiplayer support following the launch of its its first major early access update.


Dune: Spice Wars was well-received when it launched into Steam early access back in April, but several key features were missing from that initial release, including all-important multiplayer support. Shiro eventually confirmed multiplayer would arrive this &quot;summer&quot; as part of its inaugural development roadmap, and that day is finally here.


According to today&#x27;s patch notes, Dune&#x27;s multiplayer can utilise both dedicated servers and peer-to-peer connections, and enables players to try their hand at 2v2 matches or test their mettle in four-person free-for-alls, playing as Atreides, Harkonnen, Fremen, or Smugglers.

                              <span>Following its Xbox, PlayStation, and PC debut last month, Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play 3v3 skater Roller Champions has been given a Switch release date, and will, according to a new UK eShop listing, arrive on Nintendo&#x27;s platform tomorrow, 21st June.


Roller Champions is Ubisoft&#x27;s stab at creating its own chaotic sports mash-up in the vein of Rocket League, albeit one that switches out the latter&#x27;s cars-meet-football concept for a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football.


The gist is that two teams of three players hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another. When one team finally has the ball, they need to complete at least one lap before pelting it into the goal, with additional points accrued the more laps they can keep hold of it before taking a successful shot.

Streamer Rudeism, known for his weird and wonderful controllers and challenge run streams, has created a motion controller for Sifu as his latest project and streamed the results over the weekend.




How does it work? He wears two gloves that have motion sensors and a stick in each hand for movement. Simply punching the air is enough for light attacks, with other motions used for heavy attacks and parries, and then picking up items and other interactions are done by clicking in the sticks.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s soundtrack is full of choral chanting, but it turns out the lyrics aren&#x27;t actually Latin.

Today&#x27;s final day of operation was announced back in December, when developer Frostburn Studios set out a plan to sunset the game. 


The ability to purchase Gold Coin currency was disabled last year, while new accounts were disabled on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Today marks the official close-down date of Newerth&#x27;s main services.

The settlement means cheat company Elite Boss Tech and its various associates have accepted Bungie&#x27;s claim its cheat software violated Destiny 2&#x27;s user agreement. In return, Bungie has dropped other claims of its own TorrentFreak reported.


The $13.5m damages was calculated from the number of times Elite Boss Tech&#x27;s software was downloaded - 6765. Each instance incurred its own individual $2k penalty.

Deducing cryptographic keys by analyzing power consumption has long been an attack, but it’s not generally viable because measuring power consumption is often hard. This new attack measures power consumption by measuring time, making it easier to exploit.
The team discovered that dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)—a power and thermal management feature added to every modern CPU—allows attackers to deduce the changes in power consumption by monitoring the time it takes for a server to respond to specific carefully made queries.

                              <span>Alice: Madness Returns has once again disappeared from Steam.

Alice&#x27;s disappearance will be particularly frustrating for some, as the 2011 game only returned to Steam in February 2022 after a DRM issue saw it removed from sale for almost five years. Now, just a few months later, it&#x27;s gone again.

The reason for its sudden and unexpected disappearance? It&#x27;s not entirely clear. Steam&#x27;s not giving away much; Alice: Madness Returns&#x27; Steam page simply says &quot;at the request of the publisher, Alice: Madness Returns is no longer available for sale on Steam&quot;, which is a blanket statement that covers pretty much anything and everything.

Yesterday, developer Void Interactive tweeted that it was dealing with a &quot;suggested trademark infringement&quot; of its &quot;recent Night Club map&quot; which rolled out as part of the early access game&#x27;s most recent update earlier in the week.

&quot;We take IP concerns very seriously, and in a show of good faith, we have decided to remove the subject materials and any reference to them from Ready or Not and from any of our social media or other publications,&quot; Void said (thanks, NME).

                              <span>Nintendo has joined up with Lego once again to create eight new Super Mario-themed character packs.

As recapped on the Lego blog as Lego Con 2022 came to a close, &quot;two Lego Super Mario designers, Alice and Didier, raced against a 90-second clock to find the eight brand-new Lego Super Mario characters from the Series 5 Character Packs.

After searching through piles of Lego bricks, the pair eventually revealed a Red Yoshi, Purple Toad, Blue Shy Guy, Waddlewing and more. We also spotted Nabbit, Hammer Bro, Toady, and Baby Yoshi, too.

                              <span>The award-winning team behind Xbox&#x27;s candid six-part documentary series, Power On: The Story of Xbox, has secured another award: a Daytime Emmy.

The documentary - which was released on 13th December across &quot;a variety of video platforms&quot;, including Roku, IMDb TV, YouTube, Redbox, and more - won the award for Outstanding Single-Camera Editing (thanks, VGC).

The project - which explores the history of Microsoft&#x27;s console, from its conception to recent successes - began three years ago and was announced at the Xbox Anniversary Celebration.

                              <span>We already knew that Lego Brawls - a minifigure fighting game previously launched on Apple Arcade - was set to relaunch this summer on consoles and now we have a release date: 2nd September, 2022.

Published by Bandai Namco, the fighter will arrive on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S where the Smash Bros-like brawl will let &quot;Minifigure mayhem begin&quot;. Here&#x27;s a new teaser to celebrate:

As Tom explained at the time the ports were announced, the idea here is to battle - solo or with up to eight network players - and collect minifigures which you can then customise to create your own hero of choice. You can then take said hero and attempt to tackle the game&#x27;s global leaderboards.

As spotted by PCGN, a number of new items introduced along with the Werewolf expansion have descriptions that players of Square Enix&#x27;s hugely-popular MMORPG may find familiar. 

There&#x27;s the Racked Teak-a Greatshelves - a fantastic, if not particularly subtle, nod to Shadowbringers&#x27; Rak&#x27;tika Greatwood where the Viera live - as well as a reference to the game&#x27;s theme track.

                              <span>Despite its controversial launch, Diablo Immortal - Blizzard&#x27;s pocket-sized Diablo experience - has generated almost £20 million ($24m) since it launched earlier this month.

According to the analysts at Appmagic (thanks, Pocket Gamer), that makes Diablo Immortal - which has been downloaded over eight million times in just a fortnight - one of Blizzard&#x27;s biggest mobile app, second only to the immense popularity of Hearthstone. 

The game has seen its biggest success in the US, which accounts for 26 per cent of all downloads. This is followed by South Korea, Brazil, and Japan, with 11 per cent, 8 per cent, and 8 per cent of the market share respectively. The UK only features in the 17 per cent &quot;other&quot; category which aggregates low-level figures across the rest of the world.

                              <span>We’ve always known that phones—and the people carrying them—can be uniquely identified from their Bluetooth signatures, and that we need security techniques to prevent that. This new research shows that that’s not enough.
Computer scientists at the University of California San Diego proved in a study published May 24 that minute imperfections in phones caused during manufacturing create a unique Bluetooth beacon, one that establishes a digital signature or fingerprint distinct from any other device. Though phones’ Bluetooth uses cryptographic technology that limits trackability, using a radio receiver, these distortions in the Bluetooth signal can be discerned to track individual devices...</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, developer Supermassive released its sumputous slasher horror The Quarry on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in collaboration with publisher 2K Games - but a new report has claimed the game was originally in development as a &quot;signature&quot; title for Stadia, before Google made the decision to downsize its gaming operation and send the project elsewhere.


Stadia, of course, launched to much fanfare in 2019, and part of Google&#x27;s promise to early adopters was that the service would bring its own console-like exclusives from both first- and third-parties. To that end, Google established its own internal game development studio and signed deals with external developers, including Supermassive, as announced in 2020.


Those plans, however, changed dramatically just 14 months after Stadia&#x27;s high-profile arrival, with Google announcing a major rethink of its cloud streaming strategy following a less-than-stellar launch, which included the cancellation of all internal game development as it began prioritising selling its tech to third-parties.

                              <span>As part of its ongoing war against cheaters, the team behind Call of Duty&#x27;s server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, known as Ricochet, has unveiled a new mitigation technique that takes a player&#x27;s weapons (and fists) away when the system identifies them as a cheater.


Word of this latest mitigation technique comes via a new blog update detailing the current state of Call of Duty&#x27;s anti-cheat solution, and follows previously revealed anti-cheat techniques Cloaking and Damage Shield.


Damage Shield, Richochet&#x27;s first major mitigation technique, essentially works by turning on God Mode for all legitimate players when a cheater is detected in-match. Cloaking, meanwhile, makes it impossible for detected cheaters to see opponents and bullets, or even hear sounds.

Yet at the other end of the spectrum, indie games currently have an obsession with frogs and witches. 


But why? What is it about frogs and witches?

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is currently on offer as it launches on Steam.


Announced at the Final Fantasy 7 25th anniversary celebration, the game is no longer exclusive to Epic on PC and even runs on the Steam Deck.


At full price it&#x27;s £70 - the same as on Epic (quietly increased since launch) and in line with other Square Enix new releases - however you can save 29 percent as a special launch promotion.

                              <span>In perhaps the most impressive Elden Ring controller news to date, a harpist has hooked up her instrument to play FromSoftware&#x27;s epic.


It&#x27;s a project that began back in April when Anna Ellsworth posted a YouTube video explaining the process of turning her harp into a controller.


Since then, she&#x27;s beaten the dreaded Dark Souls pair Ornstein and Smough and has now turned to Elden Ring, most recently defeating Margit the Fell Omen.

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind the acclaimed likes of This War of Mine and Frostpunk, has unveiled its latest publishing partnership, a &quot;deep, morally ambiguous narrative-driven RPG&quot; currently going by the codename Project Vitriol.


While 11 Bit is publishing and assisting with Project Vitriol, the game is actually the work of Polish developer Fool&#x27;s Theory - a &quot;collective of AAA veterans&quot; with previous credits on The Witcher 2 and 3. Its previous title, open-world RPG Seven: The Days Long Gone, released in 2017, and the studio has also lent support to the likes of Outriders and Divinity Original Sin 2.


As for Project Vitriol, 11 Bit Studios says the &quot;deep, morally ambiguous narrative-driven RPG&quot; is &quot;of a scale and scope not previously undertaken by the publisher&quot;, and Fool&#x27;s Theory CEO and project lead Jakub Rokosz had a little more to say as part of its announcement.

That means Sonic Origins will include the first ever widescreen version of Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles.

The roughly $20m pay cut was signalled last summer, when EA acknowledged &quot;stockholder feedback&quot; from a non-binding but decisive say-on-pay vote. 


In a nutshell, stockholders said EA&#x27;s execs were being handed pay awards from the company money pot that were too large and too frequent. In response, EA said it would make &quot;substantial changes&quot; to the pay of executives.

The upcoming project, for now named &quot;TemPoPo&quot;, is still under-wraps. But &quot;a pixel art rendition of the key art... existings somewhere inside Unpacking&quot;, Witchbeam has said. 


The developer dropped the hint in a new blog update, and noted that no one had found the Easter egg so far. Still, the expectation is that now this information is out there, it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to discover. &quot;Let us know if you find it!&quot; Witchbeam concluded.

This crossover is thanks to the hard work of Speclizer, who used mods from OmegaFantasy to swap out Kratos and Atreus for Joel and Ellie respectively (it was also OmegaFantasy that enabled The Simpsons to tootle on over to God of War last month). This was done to &quot;celebrate two amazing games coming out this year&quot;.
And its not just Joel and Ellie that we get to see in action. The Last of Us&#x27; David also shows up as the mysterious &#x27;stranger&#x27; from the start of God of War, while the draugr have now become clickers.

                              <span>N64 classic Pokémon Snap will be added to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack library next week, on Friday 24th June. 


This is the game where you capture pictures of Pokémon, rather than capture the creatures themselves and force them to do your bidding. 


There have been plenty of weird and wonderful Pokémon spin-offs over the years, but Snap holds a firm place as one of the best. Via an on-rails safari through Pokémon environments, you get to see the little critters mucking about in their natural habitats.

&quot;We at Stunlock are very proud of the amazing start V Rising has made since launching on Early Access,&quot;  Rickard Frisegård, boss of Swedish developer Stunklock said.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait but Capcom has finally announced it&#x27;s working on a sequel to cult-classic fantasy RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma.


Speculation has been rife regarding a follow-up to the well-regarded 2012 game for some time, only exacerbated by Capcom&#x27;s decision to host a tenth anniversary livestream for the not exactly blockbuster title.


It was in this retrospective livestream that Capcom&#x27;s long-awaited announcement was finally made, with series director Hideaki Itsuno revealing that Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is currently in development by whipping off his jacket to reveal a t-shirt emblazoned with the sequel&#x27;s logo.

                              <span>Microsoft is rolling out an updated version of its Xbox App for PC that includes an at-a-glance indication of whether your machine will likely be able to run a game before you download it.



The feature, which should be particularly useful to Game Pass subscribers reckoning with the service&#x27;s sizeable library of titles, is being referred to as the Game Performance Fit Indicator.


Essentially, each time you look at a game via the Xbox App, you&#x27;ll see a short message offering a prediction of how well Microsoft expects it to run on your machine, generated by comparing a title&#x27;s performance on PCs with similar specs to yours.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced this year&#x27;s ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest event, which promises to deliver over 30 playable pre-release Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S demos starting next week.


Things kick off next Tuesday, 21st June and the event&#x27;s demos will remain available to play for seven days, with proceedings coming to a close the following Monday, 27th June.


&quot;These &#x27;game demos&#x27; are not the norm,&quot; Microsoft notes in its announcement post. &quot;Typically, the demos you see in our Demo channel are created after the game is completed (or nearly completed) and represents an almost final to final version. Think of these as akin to &#x27;show floor demos&#x27; and not necessarily indicative of the final product.&quot;
