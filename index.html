                    <span>If you fancy a tour through some of Mario Party&#x27;s back catalogue, well, Mario Party Superstars sounds like just the ticket - and it&#x27;s arriving this October. 
The game was announced as part of today&#x27;s Nintendo E3 Direct, and promises a whirlwind ride through some classic Mario Party games. It&#x27;s somewhere between a new Mario Party title and remake, essentially mixing elements of previous games into a new collection. This includes five classic Mario Party boards from the N64 era, with boards such as Peach&#x27;s Birthday Cake and Space Land making a reappearance. 
Mario Party Superstars also promises a bunch of minigames from the series&#x27; catalogue - 100 in total, in fact - along with the usual mix of zany board events. All the minigames support button controls.

                    <span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 will launch in 2022, Nintendo has confirmed. 
The hugely-anticipated sequel was shown off today at the very end of Nintendo&#x27;s E3 presentation in a new trailer which revealed new powers, new enemies, and new gameplay in the skies of Hyrule.
The ability to visit floating islands is reminiscent of Skyward Sword, the Wii Zelda entry which is getting a re-release this summer. This time, the islands look larger, and Link will be able to glide through the sky between them.

                    <span>Remember Advance Wars? Nintendo&#x27;s much-loved and long-neglected turn-based strategy series? Well it&#x27;s making a very long-awaited return as a two-game remaster bundle for Switch.
Title Advance Wars 1+2: Re-boot Camp, the surprise bundle features 3D remakes - &quot;reimagined and rebuilt from the ground-up&quot; - of the original Advance Wars and its sequel Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising (which originally released on Gameboy Advance in 2001 and 2003 respectively), which should make long-starved series fans very happy indeed. Although obviously not quite as happy as if it had been a brand-new game.
Advance Wars 1+2: Re-boot Camp is coming to Switch later this year on 3rd December.

                    <span>WarioWare is back, with WarioWare: Get it Together hitting Switch on the 10th of September.
The announcement was part of Nintendo&#x27;s E3 Direct. The gimmick? Get It Together sees players controlling the WarioWare characters inside the mini-games. So we see Wario squeezing toothpaste out of a giant tube and peeling off a facemask and dodging bird poo, for example. Elsewhere, other WarioWare characters have new talents - 9Volt uses a yo-yo to turn the blades of a windmill in one game - and different characters will be able to use their own specific abilities to complete each challenge.
This idea comes into its own in a new two-player mode which sees players competing or collaborating on a single screen. The micro-games shown throughout the reveal were very classical Wario type experiences, with a lovely swipe-file mix of styles and production values. I can&#x27;t wait.

                    <span>Metroid Dread, the sequel to Metroid Fusion, has a long, long history of being vapourware. But now, after almost 20 years, it is real. Really. 
Nintendo has just announced Metroid Dread will launch for Switch on 8th October. A subsequent Nintendo Treehouse presentation confirmed it was being developed by Nintendo and Metroid: Samus Returns studio MercurySteam. 
Footage revealed during today&#x27;s E3 Direct showed Samus being chased by a robot through various side-scrolling 2D environments. (Of course, both Samus and the robot, EMMI, are also being turned into new amiibo.)

                    <span>Kazuya from Tekken is the next Super Smash Bros. Ultimate DLC character, Nintendo has announced.
Revealed during the Nintendo Direct show, Kazuya in Smash has many of the moves Tekken fans are familiar with, including Spinning Demon and Stonehead. He&#x27;s even got his famous 10-hit combo.
The announcement video includes a cutscene showing Kazuya chucking existing Smash characters off a cliff - that&#x27;s a reference to the famous Tekken cutscene in which Kazuya&#x27;s dad, Heihachi, chucks Kazuya off a cliff.

                    <span>Alright, we&#x27;ve already had shows and big game announcements as part of this year&#x27;s all-online E3 week, but how about actually playing some upcoming games? If you&#x27;ve got an Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S, you&#x27;re in luck. 
ID@Xbox&#x27;s Summer Game Fest demo event kicks off today, and we now have the full list of 40 game demos available for players to try. Gorgeous sci-fi adventure Sable is in the mix (which I&#x27;d thoroughly recommend trying out based on my own hands-on time with the game). There&#x27;s also Tunic, a Zelda-like game with a fox as the main protagonist. 
Elsewhere on the list, you can also find Black Book - a dark RPG adventure based on slavic myths in which you play as a young sorceress and fight in card-based battles. Arietta of Spirits is a retro-inspired adventure telling an emotional story of a girl and her family who visit her grandmother&#x27;s cabin for the first time since she passed away. Echo Generation, meanwhile, is a turn-based adventure game with a real Stranger Things vibe to it:

                    <span>Planet Zoo continues its slow and steady march toward cramming in all the animals next week with the advent of its latest DLC, which introduces a range of new Africa-themed wildlife, including the meerkat, southern white rhinoceros, and more.
Arriving next Tuesday, 22nd June, Planet Zoo&#x27;s Africa Pack DLC features a total of five new animals. The meerkat will display &quot;authentic new digging behaviour&quot;, according to developer Frontier, and is joined by the aforementioned southern white rhinoceros, a couple of cuties in the form of the African penguin and fenec fox, plus the sacred scarab beetle - which is sure to delight visitors as its goes about its day rolling up poop.
Alongside its animal additions, the Africa Pack brings a new timed scenario, new enrichments items (such as the disco ball), plus over 180 new scenery pieces inspired by African architecture.

Loop Hero&#x27;s expeditions can go on for quite a while, so being able to save on the go is welcome.

                    <span>100-player WW2 first-person shooter Hell Let Loose hits new-gen consoles this year.
Black Matter&#x27;s shooter launched on Steam as an Early Access title in June 2019 and has enjoyed a positive reception. It leaves Early Access on PC and launches proper there on 27th July. It then comes out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S late 2021.

                    <span>Well, it looks like the front of Xbox game cases are getting a very slight refresh, as box art images spotted on BestBuy appear to show a newly re-designed version of the standard Xbox Series X game case. 
As you can see from these Halo Infinite and Flight Simulator listings, more of the box is taken up with game art rather than additional Xbox logos at the top, and the console banner has become a little shorter and wider. The banner has also changed colour from black to white - as if someone&#x27;s flipped a switch to put it in light mode. 
Social media account Xbox News also managed to spot a version for Forza Horizon 5, which you can see below. It&#x27;s worth noting that the big &quot;optimised for Series X&quot; badge was removed from cases last year following negative feedback from fans.

It&#x27;s down as &quot;coming soon&quot; to PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One. The announcement trailer is below:
Elex 2 is the sequel to post-apocalyptic sci-fi open-world role-playing game Elex, which Piranha Bytes&#x27; released in 2017. &quot;Hokey, uneven and janky, Elex is nonetheless a compelling throwback to a time before open worlds became choose your own to-do lists,&quot; Richie Shoemaker wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Elex review.

That includes shipments of physical copies and downloads, the developer said in a tweet.
Strive got off to a great start on PC, and hit peak Steam concurrents of over 31,000 players, according to SteamDB.

Most recently, and perhaps most relevantly, Stuart created Vikings spin-off Vikings: Valhalla, a spin-off from the popular Norse telly drama which is also Netflix-bound. 
Further back, more years than I care to mention, Stuart also wrote the screenplay for the legendary Die Hard.

Everwild, alongside various other far-off Microsoft exclusives, was absent from this year&#x27;s Bethesda-dominated Xbox E3 showcase. That is because its development has undergone a reboot, and its launch window pushed back, according to a VGC report.
But while we won&#x27;t see Everwild for some time, there&#x27;s reason to be optimistic for the project. Rare veteran Gregg Mayles, who has served at the studio for more than 30 years, was recently brought on as its creative director.

Based on preliminary reports published by the team of experts that New Hampshire engaged to examine an election discrepancy, it appears that a buildup of dust in the read heads of optical-scan voting machines (possibly over several years of use) can cause paper-fold lines in absentee ballots to be interpreted as votes… New Hampshire (and other states) may need to maintain the accuracy of their optical-scan voting machines by paying attention to three issues:...</span>

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 4 kicks off this week, and brings with it new points of interest to the map.
Satellite crash sites will be plainly visible in Verdansk &#x27;84, with the debris and impact on the landscape &quot;significant&quot;, Activision said in a blog post. These sites offer new opportunities for cover, and the satellites themselves can also be secured.
You can interact with the Sat-Links found in these areas to work toward receiving permanent rewards in the Ground Fall event at the beginning of the season. You can also obtain items to use during the match, such as killstreaks, vehicles, and field upgrades.

                    <span>As part of its E3 2021 livestream, Capcom has offered up a sprinkling of new Monster Hunter news, including confirmation that Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s first collaboration event will arrive this Friday, and that there&#x27;s a Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin demo coming next week.
Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, the latest entry in Capcom&#x27;s RPG spin-off series, comes to Switch and PC on 9th July, but interested parties will be able to download a trial version of the game next Friday, 25th June. Capcom notes all progress made in the demo will be transferable to the main game on release.
Additionally, Capcom confirmed it&#x27;ll be supporting Monster Hunter Stories 2 after launch with free title updates, the first of which will see Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Palamute join the game as a rideable Monstie on 9th July. And if you still haven&#x27;t had your fill of Monster Hunter Stories 2 trailers, here&#x27;s another one now.

Additionally, Resident Evil RE:Verse, the delayed free multiplayer component for Village owners, will finally arrive in July. This lets you play as various Resident Evil characters from throughout the series, though its earlier beta recieved a mixed reception.

                    <span>It looks like Sega might not be quite done with its spherically ensconced simians just yet; images have surfaced for a new entry in the long-running Super Monkey Ball series, this one titled Banana Mania, supposedly heading to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Series X/S.
The images in question, shared by freelance journalist Nils Ahrensmeier on Twitter earlier today, purportedly show PlayStation 5 and Switch box art for Banana Mania, alongside four typically cheery screenshots from the game.
One of these shots teases a return for Monkey Ball&#x27;s much-loved party game Monkey Target, while the others are a little harder to pin down. However, a few well-versed Monkey Ball fans are currently doing some deductive work and speculating that the images could well be pointing to a remake of 2005&#x27;s Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, which melded the first two Monkey Ball games along with brand-new content.

                    <span>Developer Okomotive has revealed Far: Changing Tides, the follow-up to its acclaimed post-apocalyptic vehicle adventure Far: Lone Sails, which is out on PC and consoles later this year.
Changing Tides sends players on a fresh bout of genteel side-scrolling vehicular management. This time, however, instead of embarking on a tank-y trundle across a dried-out ocean, they&#x27;ll be following the horizon for some boat-based adventure above and beneath the waves.
&quot;Set sail and discover the wonders of a flooded world filled with mystery,&quot; explains Okomotive. &quot;Traverse the ruins of a once great society and use the pieces from its past to build a brighter future. Dive into unknown depths on the hunt for precious fuel and salvage, devise innovative solutions to overcome intricate obstacles, and unearth forgotten relics lost to time.&quot;

                    <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s release date reveal for Flight Simulator on Xbox Series X/S, Microsoft has shared a few additional details - including confirmation that it&#x27;ll run at 30fps on console - via the time-honoured mediums of FAQ and Twitter.
Those frame rate details come via the official Microsoft Flight Simulator Twitter feed, which, in response to queries from a number of curious punters, confirmed that Xbox Series X/S players can expect a base frame rate of 30fps. It noted, however, that frame rates above 30fps are possible on TVs supporting variable refresh rates (VRR).
Over on the official Flight Simulator&#x27;s FAQ, meanwhile, most additional details provided aim to clarify questions around how the console edition will interact with the version already released on PC, and confirm, for instance, that those who own the Windows Store version on PC won&#x27;t need to purchase the console edition again.

                    <span>At long last, we finally got a proper look at Elden Ring during Summer Games Fest last week, and all of a sudden we now have a flood of information about what to expect in the upcoming game. In an interview with IGN, legendary director Hidetaka Miyazaki gave plenty of information on the background lore, along with some discussion of abilities, multiplayer and the game&#x27;s structure.
One of the first topics discussed was Elden Ring&#x27;s setting, The Lands Between, which has been deliberately designed to give &quot;an enormous sense of scale and this broadness and openness&quot;. It&#x27;s split into six major areas, each of which is the domain of a demigod. These are lined up to suggest a specific order in which to tackle them, but the player can make their own decisions about which to do first. &quot;You won&#x27;t be able to access everything from the start, but there are a lot of different ways you can approach each area,&quot; Miyazaki explained. &quot;And there&#x27;s a lot of freedom as to which order you tackle different areas as well.&quot;
Players will be able to access a hub area a little later in the game, which you can &quot;branch out from&quot;, and also the six main areas of The Lands Between. &quot;These will be the domains or the areas of the main demigod bosses,&quot; Miyazaki explained. &quot;From here, you&#x27;re able to explore not only these mainline dungeon areas, but also a wide variety of catacombs, castles, and fortresses, which are interspersed throughout the map. These have a range of scale and scope, but the main dungeons are these six - these are the ones that you&#x27;re going to be heading to on your adventures throughout the main world. &quot;

                    <span>Tomorrow&#x27;s update for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla adds a new Mastery Challenge mode to the game. 
Update 1.2.2 will arrive for PC, PlayStation, Stadia and Xbox around 1pm UK time and also adds new skills, river raid cosmetics and other improvements. 
Mastery Challenge mode is the big addition, and can be found at &quot;numerous shrines hidden in the world&quot;, Ubisoft said in its patch notes. Each shrine will host a Trial of the Bear, testing your combat strength, a Trial of the Wolf, testing your ranged ability, and a Trial of the Raven, testing your stealth.

The video, below, includes new Halo Infinite multiplayer gameplay as well as a raft of talking heads from 343.
There&#x27;s a lot to run through, but the highlight for me was the news that Halo Infinite multiplayer lets you bring your own Personal AI onto the battlefield.

                    <span>Lego has detailed a third set of Super Mario Character Packs to be released in blind bags this summer. 
As with previous waves, there are 10 additional enemies and items to collect, and you&#x27;ll need a bit of luck to obtain the full set with no duplicates. (Or to swap with a friend. Or eBay.)
There&#x27;s no release date or price yet for Series 3, but we&#x27;d expect these to cost the same as the last two waves (£3.49/$4.99/€3.99 each) and arrive alongside the upcoming Super Luigi Starter Course on 1st August.

                    <span>Remember that brightly-coloured alien exploration game In Other Waters? Well, the developer is back with another sci-fi offering, although this time it&#x27;s all taking place on a run-down space station. 
Titled Citizen Sleeper, the game was previously teased under the name Project Sidereal, but developer Jump Over The Age revealed the new name and trailer during last night&#x27;s PC Gaming Show. It&#x27;s described as &quot;roleplaying in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism,&quot; with the player taking the role of a &quot;sleeper&quot; - in other words, a digitised human consciousness. The bad news is that you&#x27;re also owned by a huge corporation that wants you back, and your body will deteriorate as part of &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; for escapees. This what happens when billionaires start jetting themselves into space, I guess. 
&quot;Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle,&quot; the Steam description explains. &quot;Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom.&quot;

But how will it play? What will you actually do? And will we ever get to finish that half-eaten space sandwich?
Bethesda has given a couple of interviews which mostly avoid answering specifics, but do touch a bit on some of the above.

                    <span>Last week, Sony announced it had signed a deal with Deviation Games to make a brand new PlayStation IP - the second such deal Sony has announced in recent months.
Deviation Games was set up in November 2019 by former Treyarch Studios developers Dave Anthony and Jason Blundell, both of whom played a key role in the success of the Call of Duty: Black Ops series.
Blundell, one of the chief creators of Call of Duty&#x27;s popular zombies mode, left Treyarch after 13 years at the developer.

                    <span>Somerville has been teased with a number of trailers over the past few years, but during yesterday&#x27;s Xbox-Bethesda showcase we got another look at the game - and now have some idea of what the main characters will look like.  
The sci-fi adventure is being made by Jumpship, an independent studio founded by animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Playdead co-founder and former CEO Dino Patti. (Playdead created Limbo and its spiritual successor Inside, two very unsettling puzzle-platformers.) 
As you can see from the trailer, Somerville set in a sci-fi world and focuses on the struggles of a family trying to survive a major disaster. &quot;In the wake of catastrophe you must find the means to make your family whole again,&quot; says the official description. &quot;Somerville is a sci-fi adventure grounded in the intimate repercussions of large-scale conflict.

Here&#x27;s a look at the teaser trailer that was shown during the Future Games showcase last night:

This dinky puzzle platformer has you controlling a miniature alien astronaut as he explores our world. He&#x27;s aided in his travels by a swarm of mini creatures, named tinykin. 
Sound familiar? While clearly inspired by Nintendo&#x27;s Pikmin, what impressed me here was how snappy and fluid the movement and exploration looks, with tinykin used to create ladders or skate around.

But perhaps it plays better? It&#x27;s impossible to say right now, as the game&#x27;s instantly-dropped PlayStation 5 demo remains broken, and unable to play.
Curious Final Fantasy fans first reported an inability to load the demo after downloading it last night. This morning, our Aoife told me it&#x27;s still not working.

                    <span>This is probably worth paying attention to:
A change to TikTok’s U.S. privacy policy on Wednesday introduced a new section that says the social video app “may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information” from its users’ content. This includes things like “faceprints and voiceprints,” the policy explained. Reached for comment, TikTok could not confirm what product developments necessitated the addition of biometric data to its list of disclosures about the information it automatically collects from users, but said it would ask for consent in the case such data collection practices began...</span>

                    <span>Tower defense title Orcs Must Die 3 will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation and Xbox on 23rd July. 
That&#x27;s almost exactly a year on from its original release as a timed-exclusive for Stadia, back in July 2020. The news was confirmed this evening, as part of the PC Gaming Show.
The latest game in the Orcs Must Die series features solo and co-op play, and a campaign set 25 years after that of Orcs Must Die 2. Clearly, you were not successful enough at getting rid of all those orcs last time around.

You&#x27;ll hear people&#x27;s inner thoughts, and use this to learn secrets - though what you do with this information is up to you. Powerful emotions will let Alex experience someone&#x27;s emotional state, and see a changed version of her surroundings, but also put Alex in a place where she&#x27;s experiencing that emotion too.

                    <span>Back in May, rumours began circulating that Square Enix was collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off titled Final Fantasy Origin. Well, it turns out those rumours weren&#x27;t far off at all! Square has now officially unveiled Team Ninja&#x27;s action-RPG Final Fantasy spin-off, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins.
Stranger of Paradise follows a band of adventurers who, as the trailer repeatedly reminds us, want to kill chaos. Or at least stab it in the face a few times until its head pops off. &quot;Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine,&quot; Square elaborates in its announcement, &quot;Yet doubts remain-are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?&quot;.
May&#x27;s rumours suggested the game would slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja&#x27;s Nioh games and From Software&#x27;s Souls series, albeit with a more accessible focus, and today&#x27;s reveal appears to support that. Square is promising &quot;exhilarating, action-packed battles&quot; against iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a &quot;world of dark fantasy&quot;.

Formerly titled Project Hitman Sniper Assassins, the game will take place in a new fictional universe unrelated to the main Hitman series or Hitman Sniper.
Instead of Agent 47, who has disappeared, you&#x27;ll follow a new group of assassins - Soji, Kiya, Kolzak, Knight, and Stone - activated by the International Contract Agency (ICA) following the rise of a new criminal network.

                    <span>Platinum Games&#x27; long-awaited Square Enix title Babylon&#x27;s Fall is now coming to PS5 as well as PS4 and PC. This was announced during Square Enix&#x27;s E3 showcase this evening.
The game&#x27;s also going live-service. The publisher treated audiences to a fairly brief trailer, featuring in-game footage of a frantic 3D action game with lots of armour and magical lightning and some decent operatic music. A follow-up developer interview revealed a game in which teams of players enjoy hack-and-slash combat and explore dungeons in groups of four. These dungeons are located on different floors of a giant tower, and end with a boss.
Regular updates will allow for new moves that can be equipped as skills. There&#x27;s a focus on character customisation and crafting, and a massive emphasis on builds, due to a &quot;Gideon coffin&quot; the characters wear that allows them to equip two additional weapons alongside the weapons they hold in their hands, and, I think, swing them about independently, a la Astral Chain. The game will ship with five weapon types, and there will be a website that allows players to tweak their builds while they&#x27;re away from the game.

                    <span>The Bethesda and Xbox showcase ended with a twist this evening, with the announcement of a brand-new game from Dishonored and Prey developer Arkane Studios.  
Titled Redfall, the game is an open-world co-op shooter arriving in summer 2022. It&#x27;s being developed by Arkane Austin, and judging by the trailer, it looks like it will feature... well, a lot of vampires and shooting.
While we don&#x27;t yet know exactly what the gameplay will look like, it will feature co-op with up to four players. &quot;Redfall blends single and multiplayer options seamlessly, allowing the player to venture into the darkness alone or to squad-up with up to three friends for four-player co-op&quot;, a Bethesda press release explained. &quot;Teammates can try different hero loadouts and combine their strengths to overcome the vampire legion and their brood of maniacal followers.&quot;

Microsoft Flight Simulator received much praise when it launched on PC at the end of last year, in large part thanks to its utterly staggering rendition of the entire world - one that Asobo has continued to build on with regular free sim updates and visual overhauls for the likes of Japan, the United States, France, Benelux, the UK, and Ireland.
&quot;From light planes to wide-body jets,&quot; explains Microsoft of its flight sim, &quot;you&#x27;ll test your piloting skills against the challenges of real-time weather, including accurate worldwide cloud cover and cloud layers, wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, rain, and lightning - all in a dynamic and living world. With the power of satellite data and cloud-based AI, you&#x27;ll travel the entire planet in amazing detail with over 37,000 airports, 2 million cities, 1.5 billion buildings, real mountain ranges, roads, trees, rivers, animals, traffic, and more.&quot;

                    <span>Fallout 3&#x27;s The Pitt hits Fallout 76 in 2022.
The Pitt was the second add-on for Fallout 3, Bethesda&#x27;s 2008 sci-fi role-playing game. It was an atmospheric setting that depicted post-nuclear Pittsburgh.
The Pitt arrives as an Expedition for Fallout 76. It&#x27;s a free update that will, for the first time, take players outside of Appalachia. Expeditions are story driven, repeatable missions to various locales in the Fallout universe - starting with The Pitt in 2022. The trailer is below:

                    <span>Age of Empires 4 releases 28th October, 2021 - here&#x27;s a shiny new gameplay trailer that came with the announcement during Xbox&#x27;s E3 conference.
The trailer itself showed off some naval battles, all kinds of horse, camel and elephant cavalry, and some notable historical figures, like Joan of Arc.
There was also plenty of siege and town-based action, and lots of people in armour running at each other on nice grassy hills, which is exactly what we want.

The video, below, shows some gameplay from the player&#x27;s perspective, with lots of non-gameplay angles, too.
Halo Infinite, due out &quot;holiday 2021&quot; on Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via the Microsoft Store and Steam, as well as Xbox Game Pass day one, offers free-to-play multiplayer.

                    <span>The Outer Worlds is getting a sequel for PC and Xbox Series X/S. It&#x27;s called The Outer Worlds 2. 
In a humorous CGI trailer, developer Obsidian cheekily acknowledged there was not much else to show of the game as yet, and no word on a release window. Still, it&#x27;s nice to know its coming.
&quot;New solar system, new crew, same Outer Worlds,&quot; the trailer&#x27;s description reads. &quot;The Outer Worlds 2 is coming... and when that day is closer we will show you more... but until then enjoy this.&quot;

Picking up after the events of the first game, A Plague Tale: Requiem, as the sequel is known, will follow Amicia and her brother Hugo on a perilous new quest, &quot;doing whatever it takes to survive a brutal, uncaring world.&quot;
That&#x27;s pretty much all we&#x27;re getting at the moment, but expect plenty more details as A Plague Tale: Requiem readies to launch on Xbox and PC - as well as Game Pass - some time next year.

                    <span>Grounded, the game about being very small and trapped in your own back yard, is getting a new update. The Shroom &amp; Doom update was announced at this year&#x27;s Microsoft and Bethesda E3 showcase, and looks really pretty wonderful.
WARNING: BIG SPIDER IN THE TRAILER BELOW.
The update allows for sitting (apparently this was heavily requested), pets and a new giant spider called the Brood Mother. Not fun.

                    <span>Psychonauts 2 is arriving on 25th August, as announced during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase this evening.
The third-person platformer has seen a series of delays, with developer Double Fine previously explaining that it needed more time to bring it up to standard, and that the studio needed time to adjust to its acquisition by Microsoft. It looks like we&#x27;ll finally see the results of all this hard work soon, however, and Double Fine provided a fresh peek at Psychonauts 2 with a gameplay trailer shown during the showcase livestream:  
&quot;Psychonauts 2 is an exciting journey through the mind filled with the signature Double Fine humor and heart, and a touch of next-level platforming,&quot; says the official blog post. &quot;You play as Razputin Aquato, a trained acrobat and powerful young psychic, who has realized his lifelong dream of joining the international psychic espionage organization known as the Psychonauts. But these psychic super spies are in trouble. Raz must use his powers to bring the murderous psychic villain, Maligula, back from the dead! Check out the video above and get psyched!&quot;

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 got a new trailer in Xbox&#x27;s E3 showcase, and it&#x27;s a silly one.
It&#x27;s all in-game captured footage from an Xbox Series X, showing off the chaos of the game&#x27;s new 128-person battles and a range of new toys.
The highlights include a tank being air-dropped into battle via parachute, a grappling hook that should open up some new opportunities for the more ingenuitive campers (and anti-campers), some cross-skyscraper ziplines, a desert cyclone, and a rocket launching into the atmosphere. There&#x27;s a nice tone to it all, too - clearly DICE is aware of the more ridiculous stunts the Battlefield community has become known for pulling off.

Arriving alongside the third season of content for Rare&#x27;s multiplayer pirate game, Sea of Thieves: A Pirate&#x27;s Life, as the crossover is known, will send players on a new five-episode story campaign, playable either solo or in a crew, involving the world&#x27;s greatest Pirate Treasure, which Jack Sparrow just so happens to have stolen. 
Davy Jones, inevitably, isn&#x27;t far behind, and the adventure will see players setting sail to visit new locations from both universes - including some from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park rides that didn&#x27;t quite make it into the movies.

                    <span>The hand-painted RPG Book of Travels will release into Early Access on 9th August, 2021.
Book of Travels was originally announced back in September 2019, and came with the curious description of being a TMORPG - a tiny massive multiplayer online roleplaying game. That&#x27;s reportedly because &quot;players per server are limited and meetings between players will be uncommon&quot;.

According to the developer, the game tells the story of Arietta and her family, &quot;visiting their Grandmother&#x27;s cabin for the first time after her passing away a year prior&quot;. 
&quot;However, the family trip takes an unexpected turn when Arietta meets a mysterious new friend and gains the ability to see strange spirits that inhabit the island,&quot; the description explains.

Confirmation came during a reveal of Far Cry 6&#x27;s season pass details, which also showed that the DLC lets you play as Vaas, Pagan Min, and Joseph Seed - villains from previous Far Cry games. 
While, admittedly, the teaser doesn&#x27;t tell us much, the neon colours that come in 30 seconds before the end of the trailer are unmistakable. Here, take a look:

                    <span>Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s creator Scott Cawthon has said he &quot;won&#x27;t apologise for&quot; funding US Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, but acknowledged that &quot;with so many people from the LGBT community in the fanbase that I love&quot;, it was &quot;not an option&quot; to ignore fan backlash about his political beliefs.
While many of the candidates Cawthon backed are conservative and sit within America&#x27;s right-leaning Republican party, Cawthon insists that &quot;for those who took the time to look&quot;, they&#x27;d see that the candidates he supported &quot;included men, women, white people, black people, republicans, and democrats&quot;. 
Directly addressing his community on Reddit, Cawthon also took the time to discuss why he supports Republicans despite their broadly anti-LGBTQIA+ stance, stating &quot;even if there were candidates who had better things to say to the LGBT community directly, and bigger promises to make, I believed that their stances on other issues would have ended up doing much greater harm to those communities than good&quot;.

Though still a little ways off - right now, the only release window we have is &quot;2022&quot; - the trailer shows the game&#x27;s gorgeous style and soundtrack, as well as offer a glimpse of the &quot;monstrous troll&quot; that kidnaps the lead character&#x27;s older sister.

                    <span>Town of Light developer LKA has dropped a new video teaser for its upcoming psychological thriller, Martha Is Dead.
The trailer doesn&#x27;t give away much, but it does touch upon the Tale of the White Lady, &quot;the spirit of a murdered, tortured soul whose one goal is to seek a moment&#x27;s relief by dragging others into the water to suffer the same fate&quot;.
The &quot;savage story&quot; told in the video is reportedly based upon a real-life Italian legend, which is purportedly passed down through from generation to generation much as it&#x27;s done in this trailer, with the young Giulia badgering her grandmother to tell her the spooky story of &quot;a drowned maiden, murdered in a fit of jealousy by her lover who now stalks the shores of the lake where she suffered in her final moments&quot;.

The milestone was announced as part of last night&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation (you can catch up now courtesy of Martin&#x27;s excellent on-the-night liveblogging right here).
&quot;This year has been an incredibly intense one for The Crew 2 and everybody at Ivory Tower,&quot; the team explains on the official website. &quot;We managed to deliver an update every four months, as well as a new episode every two months. Our teams have successfully shipped all the content we promised a year ago.&quot;

While developer Ubisoft stopped short of outlining when the betas will launch, it does, however, invite players to register their interest in trying out the &quot;massive multiplayer outdoor sports playground&quot; via upcoming betas.
Even without details on when the beta tests will go live, players interested in trying Riders Republic ahead of its launch can register their interest now on the official website. Though there&#x27;s not much information on the website just yet, it does intimate that betas will be available on all platforms Riders Republic is coming to, including Google Stadia.

It is perhaps surprising to see the visually-impressive role-player getting ported to last-gen - not that we saw much of what that PS4 version might look like today. But this move will, obviously, open up the game to a wider audience.
Today also brought word of Fire &amp; Darkness, a new expansion for Godfall which adds in a new realm, new story, and a hoard of new loot.

Let&#x27;s start with Trek to Yomi, a &quot;cinematic tour-de-force&quot; inspired by classic samurai films from director Leonard Menchiari and Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind the 2013 reboot of Shadow Warrior and its 2016 sequel, Shadow Warrior 2.

                    <span>Cast your mind back to 2017, and you might recall Ubisoft announcing it was working on a new video game adaptation of James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar movie. Five years of almost complete silence around the project followed, but all that&#x27;s now changed, with Ubisoft showing the first footage of its Avatar game, now titled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, during its E3 livestream.
&quot;In this new, standalone story,&quot; explains Ubisoft, &quot;play as a Na&#x27;vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back the formidable RDA forces that threaten it.&quot;
Ubisoft is calling Frontiers of Pandora a first-person action-adventure and a &quot;immersive, open world experience&quot;, and its trailer - running on the latest version of Ubisoft&#x27;s Snowdrop Engine, according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot - offers a jaunt through a gorgeous rendition of the planet Pandora, complete with all the exotic flora and fauna you could possible hope for.

                    <span>Humankind, Amplitude&#x27;s upcoming, history-spanning 4X game, gets a new closed beta soon, and it&#x27;ll let you play through five of the game&#x27;s six eras. There&#x27;s also a snazzy new trailer to come with the announcement, which you can watch here:
Amplitude&#x27;s done plenty of other betas like this in the past - which the studio refers to as OpenDevs - but this is the furthest into a game of Humankind you&#x27;ll have been able to get, by some way.
You can play either 200 turns or up to the end of the Industrial Era, whichever comes first. Industrial era features include resources like coal and oil, railways, and artillery and air battles - we actually had a chance to explore some more of this ourselves during our latest preview but barely got halfway there, despite playing a good 10 to 15-odd hours, which should give you an idea of just how long you get with this beta.

                    <span>Ubisoft has now gone into some detail on Rainbow Six Extraction, its upcoming co-op shooter where you team up with friends to face down an alien threat.
It launches for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Stadia, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 16th September, with crossplay across all platforms.
The name of the game is Extraction, and as you might expect, the aim of the game is to survive until... well, you are extracted. Who would have called this game anything else?!

                    <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will get a second year of expansions, Ubisoft announced tonight during its E3 Forward event. 
This is the first time any game in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series has received this level of post-launch support, but this news isn&#x27;t surprising. Firstly, Valhalla has gone down very well. Secondly, as we reported last month, datamining has pointed to the mythical realm of Muspelheim coming down the line. And, indeed, Ubisoft teased Muspelheim tonight.
Before all that, Valhalla has its previously-announced Siege of Paris expansion coming this summer. No release date for that was shared, but we got a good look at footage. Ubisoft also confirmed the fan-favourite &quot;black box&quot; missions from the series&#x27; past will return here. These are assassination target opportunities where you have a set location and multiple methods to take down a target.

                    <span>Yes, the Just Dance franchise is still going strong, and we now have a release date for the next entry in the series: and it&#x27;s 4th November. 
The news was unveiled during this evening&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream. The announcement also featured celebrity performer and choreographer Todrick Hall (who you may recognise from his appearances on RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race). He released a popular single called Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels in 2019, and this song is set to be included in the line-up for Just Dance 2022. 
The game is due to feature 40 tracks in total, and along with Todrick Hall&#x27;s music you can expect to find Level Up by Ciara and Believer by Imagine Dragons.

                    <span>The ever-popular Rainbow Six Siege will get crossplay support, Ubisoft has announced, though PlayStation and Xbox platforms will have to wait some time.
Crossplay and cross-progression between PC, Stadia and Luna will arrive on 30th June, Ubisoft said tonight during its E3 Ubisoft Forward presentation. 
PlayStation and Xbox crossplay will arrive later, in &quot;early 2022&quot;. At that point, cross-progression between all platforms will then be possible.

In SkateBird, players take on the role of a &quot;chill little skateboarding bird&quot; whose human friend is never home to play, thanks to their job. Luckily, the bird is an enterprising sort and, to help pass the time, has constructed a miniature skating paradise in the form of a homemade skatepark.
Here, players can trick and grind, completing missions and skating their best skate to unlock new bird-sized courses, attract a loyal bird following, and somehow fix their human friend&#x27;s life.

                    <span>The E3 leaks keep on coming: this time it&#x27;s Yakuza: Like a Dragon for Xbox Game Pass.
Confirmation comes from a snapshot of Yakuza: Like a Dragon&#x27;s listing on the Brazilian Microsoft Store. There was mention of &quot;included with Game Pass&quot; for accompanying content. It looks like this reference to Game Pass was swiftly removed, but not before Twitter user @pedroxbz noticed.
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s Yakuza: Like a Dragon launched in Japan for PlayStation 4 in January 2020, before coming out internationally in November that year on multiple platforms. It was a launch title for Xbox Series X and S. It came out on PlayStation 5 four months later, in March.

                    <span>A third Ubisoft E3 reveal has leaked.
As spotted by The Riff Repeater, the latest Gibson email blast fully revealed Rocksmith+, which goes into PC closed beta today.
Rocksmith is Ubisoft&#x27;s guitar teaching game. In April 2020, developer Ubisoft San Francisco announced DLC for the original Rocksmith had come to an end, with the team moving on to a new project. Perhaps Rocksmith+ is it.

                    <span>Ubisoft has suffered another leak for one of its games, this time DLC for the upcoming Far Cry 6.
A video advert was spotted by fans playing on YouTube, and although Ubisoft has issued copyright claims in a bid to scrub the leak from the internet, it&#x27;s readily available.
According to the advert, the Far Cry 6 season pass lets you play as villains from previous Far Cry games. Vaas from Far Cry 3 is shown, as is Pagan from Far Cry 4 and Joseph from Far Cry 5.

Redditor JohnTLH spotted the news in the YouTube description for the upcoming Back 4 Blood PvP video reveal, which is set for 10pm UK time on Sunday 13th June.
That reveal follows Microsoft&#x27;s E3 press conference, which kicks off at 6pm the same day. I suspect the announcement will be made - officially! - during Microsoft&#x27;s press conference.

Speaking in the latest Axios Gaming newsletter, Ryan was asked about a 2017 interview with Time in which he recalled seeing different versions of Gran Turismo running side-by-side on PSone, PS2, PS3 and PS4.
&quot;The PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?&quot; he said at the time.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been almost a year and a half since our coins were well and truly tossed by Netflix&#x27;s inaugural season of The Witcher, so anticipation is understandably high for news on Season Two. As part of its Geeked Week of reveals, Netflix teased a first look at things to come, and it&#x27;s delivered exactly that - albeit limiting itself to just 12 seconds of footage.
Even before the conclusion of The Witcher&#x27;s well-received first season, Netflix confirmed an eventual return for Geralt, Jennefer, Ciri, and Jaskier (as played by Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan, and Joey Batey respectively).
Since then, we&#x27;ve learned that the second season - which promises to dial back on the time-hopping antics of its predecessor - will usher in new cast members including Simon Callow as the Dorian detective Codringher, Silent Witness&#x27; Liz Carr as business partner Fenn, Bridgerton&#x27;s Adjoa Andoh as priestess Nenneke, and Brave New World&#x27;s Cassie Clare as Phillippa Eilhart, sorceress and advisor to King Vizimir.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s animated adaptation of legendary video game series Castlevania is now at the end of its acclaimed four-season run, and fans have been wondering what comes next. Today brings answer: more Castlevania, but different.
Castlevania&#x27;s future on Netflix was left in doubt when the streaming service opted to wind up the series in its current guise after showrunner Warren Ellis departed from the show following allegations of sexual misconduct. However, subsequent rumours suggested a spin-off was in the works, and Netflix has now made that official.
With Castlevania&#x27;s current run now concluded, Netflix is working on a brand-new series that will take Richter Belmont (son of original series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - both familiar characters to game fans - to 1792 France for an adventure that unfolds against the backdrop of the French Revolution.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s apparent mission to give every single video game in the universe the TV show treatment is continuing with three newly announced animated adaptations of Ubisoft properties: Splinter Cell, Far Cry, and unforgettable Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon.
A Splinter Cell animated adaptation was first rumoured last July, but Ubisoft and Netflix have now made the show official. It&#x27;ll follows the adventures of iconic video game series protagonist Sam Fisher after he&#x27;s recruited to work for the NSA&#x27;s mysterious Echelon Division.
Expect black ops missions, stealth, and military tactics in a series that&#x27;s being written by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad. That&#x27;s pretty much all Netflix has shared right now, other than this appropriately shadowy glimpse of Sam as he&#x27;ll appear in the show:

                    <span>Netflix has a lot of video game adaptations in the works at the moment, and we&#x27;ll be seeing the fruits of those ongoing labours later today as its Geeked Week of reveals concludes. It promises to be a busy one - debuting footage from the likes of The Witcher Season 2 and Cuphead - but first there are the opening three minutes of the streaming service&#x27;s CGI Resident Evil series ahead of its release in July. 
Known as Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, this animated adaption takes place several years after the events of Resident Evil 4, with Leon S. Kennedy once again serving as the US president&#x27;s bodyguard - which would probably seem like a walk in the park compared to his usual adventures if it wasn&#x27;t for the threat of an imminent zombie outbreak.
Claire Redfield also plays a role in Leon&#x27;s latest adventure, embarking on her own investigation as (the supposedly canon) events unfold, and if you&#x27;re curious to see how proceedings kick off, you can do that via the first three minutes of the show below.

Amazon Games has snapped up the free-to-play Diablo-style action RPG for release on PC. A beta is planned later this summer. The trailer shown during last night&#x27;s Summer Game Fest event is below:
Lost Ark is already out in Korea, Japan and Russia, and has more than eight million concurrent players, Amazon said. It&#x27;s developed by South Korean studio Smilegate RPG, whose parent company developed the phenomenally popular first-person shooter Crossfire.

Arc System Works issued the warning in a post on Strive&#x27;s Steam page just a few hours before the game went live on PC.
The fighting game does support 4K resolutions, but is currently experiencing severe slowdowns during specific situations in battle, such as when counter-hitting, Arc System Works said.

                    <span>Some Nintendo Switch users who installed the system&#x27;s latest firmware update have reported issues downloading purchased games from their store history.
The issue shows up as error code 2123-1502, for which there are steps on Nintendo&#x27;s customer support site. But fans affected by the problem say these do not fix the bug in most cases.
A spate of reports flagging up this error code erupted this week when Nintendo released a small and otherwise unimportant system update.

In a blog post, Bethesda said the Nuclear Winter mode will come to an end in September.
Explaining the decision, Bethesda said Nuclear Winter had suffered from a lack of players, which meant it had become difficult to create full lobbies in a reasonable matchmaking time.

                    <span>Hackers have reportedly stolen the source code to FIFA 21 and game engine Frostbite.

                    <span>Everyone&#x27;s doing a Nintendo Direct these days, and now top indie publisher Annapurna Interactive is no different. 
The first ever Annapurna Interactive Showcase will be broadcast on 29th July at 8pm UK time (midday Pacific) in all of the usual streaming places. 
Expect updates on upcoming Annapurna games (there are a lot!) such as The Artful Escape, Skin Deep, Solar Ash, Neon White and Stray. New game announcements will also feature, as Annapurna adds to its bulging top-tier indie roster.

                    <span>Last night&#x27;s flurry of Summer Game Fest announcements included a 22nd October release date for House of Ashes, the third game in Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures Anthology.
A fresh trailer also includes a blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it reveal of the game&#x27;s monster big bad (it&#x27;s right at the very end, if you want to avoid spoilers).
Last month I sat down with House of Ashes director Will Doyle to discuss the game&#x27;s Iraq War setting, horror influences and historical horror.

                    <span>For three years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Australian Federal Police owned and operated a commercial encrypted phone app, called AN0M, that was used by organized crime around the world. Of course, the police were able to read everything — I don’t even know if this qualifies as a backdoor. This week, the world’s police organizations announced 800 arrests based on text messages sent over the app. We’ve seen law enforcement take over encrypted apps before: for example, EncroChat.

                    <span>Last Stop, the supernatural &quot;anthology drama&quot; from  Virginia developer Variable State, finally has a release date, and will be making its way to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 22nd July.
Last Stop is described as a game about &quot;secret lives, the ties that bind, and how magic can be found in the mundane&quot;, and follows the interweaving, supernaturally tinged tales of three separate characters in modern day London.
There&#x27;s Donna, a &quot;spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life&quot;; John, an &quot;overworked middle-aged single dad&quot; who&#x27;s &quot;burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent&quot;; plus Meera, a &quot;ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work.&quot;

                    <span>Double Fine and iam8bit&#x27;s latest indie-focussed Day of the Devs showcase has been and gone, offering a closer look at a variety of new titles heading release-ward in the coming months and beyond. Most aren&#x27;t new new games in terms of reveals but there&#x27;s some cracking stuff in there, and, in case you missed it, here&#x27;s everything - from the sci-fi sequel-ing of Axiom Verge 2 to the cooking delights of Hot Pot - that put in an appearance during the show. Do note that the livestream features some extra gameplay not found in the accompanying videos below.
Axiom Verge 2
Developer Thomas Happ&#x27;s Axiom Verge 2, the sequel to his acclaimed 2005 retro-styled Metroid-a-like, returned with brand-new gameplay, highlighting some the abilities that new protagonist Indra - a melee-based character, in contrast to her gun-focussed predecessor - will wield, including new hacking abilities that&#x27;ll even let players complete avoid boss battles. Happ also dropped the news that Axiom Verge 2 will also be coming to PlayStation 4 and PS5 alongside the previously announced Switch and PC versions.

                    <span>Midway through this evening&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, CD Projekt released a statement discussing the circulation of stolen data from a ransomware attack - and the company is concerned it may contain employee and contractor data.
Earlier this year CD Projekt announced it had been hit by a ransomware attack, and last week we began to hear reports this stolen data was being actively shared online. Several developer-made bug montages emerged from this, but source code for several CD Projekt games (including The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077) is also reported to have been shared, and CD Projekt is concerned employee and contractor data is caught up in this.
&quot;... We have learned new information regarding the breach, and now have reason to believe that internal data illegally obtained during the attack is currently being circulated on the internet,&quot; the statement says. &quot;We are not able to confirm the exact contents of the data in question, though we believe it may include current/former employee and contractor details in addition to data related to our games. Furthermore, we cannot confirm whether or not the data involved may have been manipulated or tampered with following the breach.&quot;

                    <span>Next week&#x27;s Xbox Summer Game Fest demo event has been detailed. It&#x27;ll bring us more than 40 demos of upcoming, unreleased games on Xbox Series S and X, and Xbox One. The demos will be available for a week, from 15th June to 21st. After that, they&#x27;ll disappear.
Only a handful of the titles have been revealed so far. Thankfully, one of them is Sable, the gorgeous-looking desert sci-fi game which we&#x27;ll have a write-up on very soon. Another is Tunic, the adorably cute, Zelda-like adventure game. Both of these were glimpsed in the Summer Games Fest broadcast this evening.
The other games on the list are The Riftbreaker, which I&#x27;ve tried on PC (and really liked), and Echo Generation and Lake.

The original Axiom Verge, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched back in 2015, earning plenty of praise for its elegant blend of familiar nostalgia-tweaking Metroid staples and thrilling new twists.
Axiom Verge 2, which sends players on a quest to &quot;discover the origins of the Axiom Verge universe, expands on its celebrated predecessor in a multitude of ways. There&#x27;s an entirely new world, for instance, as well as new enemies, and a new protagonist.

Deviation Games was set up by CEO Dave Anthony and director Jason Blundell, both of whom worked on Call of Duty at Treyarch.
Blundell, one of the chief creators of Call of Duty&#x27;s popular zombies mode, left Treyarch in 2020 after 13 years.

The hugely-anticipated collaboration between Souls developer FromSoftware, creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin was shown properly for the first time at the end of tonight&#x27;s Summer Games Fest event, closing the show.
The game&#x27;s website has revealed further information, including the fact you&#x27;ll be able to &quot;traverse the breathtaking world on foot or on horseback, alone or online with other players&quot;.

                    <span>Sky: Children of the Light, the acclaimed &quot;social adventure&quot; from Journey and Flower developer ThatGameCompany, will be making its way to Switch on 29th June.
Sky, which debuted on iOS in 2019 before heading to Android, unfolds across the seven realms of a beautiful kingdom of billowing clouds, which players can explore as their whims take them.
There are puzzley-platformy elements alongside delicate story vignettes, and it&#x27;s all build around a gently collaborative multiplayer aspect, where co-operation is integral to progression, designed to encourage &quot;compassion, friendship, and altruism&quot;.

                    <span>One indie game which caught my eye during tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest stream was Planet of Lana, a beautiful side-scrolling platformer coming in 2022. 
It&#x27;s the work of new outfit Wishfully, and has a Limbo-esque vibe to it. While more colourful, there&#x27;s definitely something eerie about watching Planet of Lana&#x27;s protagonist and her little friend see rockets falling from the sky.
&quot;Planet of Lana is a cinematic puzzle adventure framed by an epic sci-fi saga that stretches across centuries and galaxies,&quot; Wishfully describes.

                    <span>Stray Bombay, the studio formed by Left 4 Dead and Portal writer Chet Faliszek, and Riot Games designer Kimberley Voll, has revealed its new game The Anacrusis.
It&#x27;s - like Left 4 Dead - a co-operative shooter for four people, and it takes place on an abandoned starship on the edge of explored space. There you&#x27;ll fight seemingly endless hordes of aliens in an &quot;infinitely replayable fight&quot;, according to Summer Games Fest host Geoff Keighley, who announced the game. You&#x27;ll unlock perks and weapons and &quot;new ways to play you can share with your team&quot;, said Keighley.
Despite the theme, Anacrusis looks like a very bright and upbeat game. It&#x27;s not dissimilar to the Portal series, actually, with brightly lit, clean sci-fi scenery, and some arty splashes of turquoise and orangey-red here and there. Very pleasant.

                    <span>It seems there&#x27;s a whole lot of content on the horizon for social deduction game Among Us, as developer InnerSloth has detailed its upcoming plans for 2021 - and it&#x27;s looking like a busy schedule. 
The big news revealed during Summer Game Fest is that a new mode is on the way, called Hide and Seek. It seems seekers will be given a very small radius in which they can see other players, leaving it up to those hiding to out-manoeuvre their pursuers. 
And that&#x27;s not the only major gameplay change - after modders started doing it themselves, some new roles are officially being added to the mix, including Sheriff and Scientist roles. As of yet there&#x27;s no details on how these work (even on the roadmap explainer page), so I imagine this will be explained at a later date.

The Deep Silver parent company announced Prime Matter alongside a dozen games it&#x27;s set to publish, including Payday 3 from Starbreeze and a real-time strategy Crossfire game from Hardspace: Shipbreaker and Homeworld 3 developer Blackbird Interactive.
The first Painkiller game was developed by Outriders studio People Can Fly and came out in 2004. Painkiller: Hell &amp; Damnation, a partial remake of and sequel to the original, launched in 2012. We haven&#x27;t had a new Painkiller since.

Salt and Sacrifice, much like its predecessor, sports side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat. This time, however, players, in the role of a Marked Inquisitor, can choose from one of eight classes - Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage - as they battle their way through the world of Alterstone Kingdom.
&quot;Track down over 20 types of Mages in abandoned villages, dungeons, tomb-temples, and more,&quot; explains Ska in its announcement. &quot;Ransack their remains to forge new weapons and armour with Runic Arts and become even stronger for the battles ahead.&quot;

                    <span>Coming-of-age title Sable is due to arrive on September 23rd, it&#x27;s been revealed during tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest.
The game was first announced back at E3 2018, but a series of delays saw its release date pushed back to 2021. Players take on the role of Sable, and embark on a rite of passage that sees her leave her tribe to explore the world on her hoverbike. It&#x27;s got a gorgeous art style that&#x27;s inspired by French artist Mobieus, and a sci-fi open world that feels very reminiscent of some of the wrecks seen in Star Wars. Oh, and it&#x27;s set to launch on PC and Xbox. 
Sable is being developed by a small team in the UK called Shedworks, who - you guessed it - work out of a garden shed. I visited Shedworks back in 2018 to learn about Sable&#x27;s story - and also check out the shed for myself.

                    <span>Frontier Developments&#x27; dinosaur-infused theme park management sim Jurassic World Evolution is getting a sequel, and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam later this year.
As in the original Jurassic World Evolution, which released back in 2018, players will be tasked with building and maintaining their own dinosaur theme park - laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and, of course, making sure the attractions don&#x27;t eat the guests. 
Moving away from Muertes Archipelago, Jurassic World Evolution 2 will let players build parks across a diverse range of new environments - including dense forests and scorched deserts - utilising &quot;deeper management tools and creative options&quot;, including new building types.

                    <span>Death Stranding is coming to the PlayStation 5 in the form of a Director&#x27;s Cut.
Creator Hideo Kojima revealed the news this evening during the Summer Game Fest, after an extended Zoom call with best buddy Geoff Keighley. 
Footage of the Director&#x27;s Cut showed a bizarre scene where protagonist Sam Bridges picked up a Metal Gear Solid-esque cardboard box, emptied it of oranges, and then climbed inside. Bizarre, but we&#x27;d have hoped for nothing less.

Remedy&#x27;s supernatural third-person action adventure is free on Epic&#x27;s store now until 4pm UK time on 17th June. Control is normally £24.99.
Donlan penned Eurogamer&#x27;s Control review, saying &quot;giddy action and astonishing art design combine in one of the great locations of modern video games&quot;. Well worth grabbing, then, if you don&#x27;t have it already.

                    <span>Earlier this year, developer Iron Gate released a pretty ambitious roadmap for Valheim that included several major updates and a host of smaller improvements: but as the months passed, it began to seem less and less likely that Iron Gate would meet all these targets. Sure enough, the Iron Gate team has confirmed that it&#x27;s had to revise its roadmap for 2021 - and that includes a trimmed-down version of its update schedule. 
&quot;As we&#x27;re sure lots of you suspected, we won&#x27;t be able to deliver four updates this year,&quot; Iron Gate explained in an update post on Steam. &quot;Instead, we&#x27;re now planning to launch Hearth and Home in Q3 2021, and we&#x27;re temporarily taking down the roadmap whilst we make some changes. We are sorry it&#x27;s taken us so long to update you.&quot;
Iron Gate went on to explain that it hadn&#x27;t been prepared for &quot;such a large influx of players&quot;, and the game&#x27;s popularity highlighted plenty of bugs that needed urgent fixes. &quot;Our priority has been to make the current experience as stable as possible and this has meant new content has taken a backseat. To put it clearly; we haven&#x27;t been able to focus all of our resources on Hearth and Home until May.

First up, Microsoft said it&#x27;s working to put Xbox in TVs.
The company is working with TV manufacturers to &quot;embed&quot; the Xbox experience directly into internet-connected televisions with no extra hardware required except a controller.

Speaking at part of a pre-E3, &quot;What&#x27;s Next for Gaming&quot; virtual briefing shown to press this week, Spencer took aim at Sony&#x27;s strategy of releasing its PlayStation-exclusives on PC years after they come out on console.
Here&#x27;s the quote from Spencer in full:

Liz Hamren, CVP of Gaming Experiences &amp; Platforms, said Microsoft was already working on new hardware, &quot;some of which won&#x27;t come to light for years.&quot;
&quot;Cloud is key to our hardware and Game Pass roadmaps, but no one should think we&#x27;re slowing down on our core console engineering. In fact, we&#x27;re accelerating it,&quot; Hamren said in a video briefing shown to press this week.

Made by King, Activision&#x27;s mobile arm, the hugely-lucrative On the Run launches its third season, Battle of the Dragons, today, 10th June. 
Spyro will make an appearance, but can you actually play as Spyro? It looks like you&#x27;ll get a Spyro-themed skin for Crash - so maybe that&#x27;s as close as it gets.

                    <span>PUBG&#x27;s bots have never been particularly popular with the community ever since they were introduced to public matchmaking, but a recent update transformed the bumbling bots into something far worse: horrifyingly accurate aimbots. 
Patch 12.1 brought with it some changes to bot AI, which were - in theory - supposed to improve their behaviour, but it seems PUBG Corp made them a little too good. Players took to Reddit to document these machines of terror, pointing out that they were behaving like cheaters. Those who spectated the bots or replayed death cams discovered they effectively had wall hacks and aimbot enabled, with the bots spinning around to obliterate players with unnerving speed and accuracy. 
&quot;They&#x27;re &#x27;aim bots&#x27; now and that&#x27;s no joke,&quot; said appropriately-named Reddit user Morbidly Tortured. &quot;I got taken out by a bot from 200 meters out. It auto locked on to me and hit every shot. I almost reported it until I spectated for about three minutes and noticed it was a bot with how it was running, stopping, going prone.&quot;

It also brought us details on the three different editions of Battlefield 2042 available, with different prices for its cheapest edition depending on where you&#x27;ll play. 
For this basic edition, Battlefield 2042 costs £10/$10 less on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One than you&#x27;ll pay on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. For fancier editions, it&#x27;s £10/$10 less on PC only.

                    <span>The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is out now - and its PC port has been found wanting.
The PC version of this action game collection is bare bones, with severely limited customisation and graphics options.
It does not support mouse and keyboard, forcing PC users to play with a controller. A controller is perhaps preferable for Ninja Gaiden, but to not provide the option of mouse and keyboard is shocking.

                    <span>“Markpainting” is a clever technique to watermark photos in such a way that makes it easier to detect ML-based manipulation:
An image owner can modify their image in subtle ways which are not themselves very visible, but will sabotage any attempt to inpaint it by adding visible information determined in advance by the markpainter.
One application is tamper-resistant marks. For example, a photo agency that makes stock photos available on its website with copyright watermarks can markpaint them in such a way that anyone using common editing software to remove a watermark will fail; the copyright mark will be markpainted right back. So watermarks can be made a lot more robust...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming but Overwatch is finally getting cross-play support, enabling players to compete with and against one another regardless of platform.
Game director Aaron Keller announced the feature during Blizzard&#x27;s latest developer update, working through some of the special matchmaking rules that&#x27;ll be introduced once cross-play arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
Essentially, while parties of console-only players will continue to be placed with other consoles players during matchmaking, and those on PC will continue to be placed with other PC players, mixed teams will be placed in the PC matchmaking pool. The one exception to this is Competitive Play mode, which will not permit mixed groups at all.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone will get a Vanguard-themed map set in the Pacific theatre of World War 2, according to a new report.
VGC said the battle royale will get an entirely new Warzone map - &quot;the series&#x27; largest and most ambitious to date&quot; - to coincide with the November release of Sledgehammer&#x27;s World War 2-themed premium entry, Call of Duty: Vanguard.
The current 1984 version of Verdansk map launched in April - half a year after Treyarch&#x27;s Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War came out.

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted the world to think differently about remote work, with more companies allowing employees to pick between working from home or the office. With the vaccine rollout now in progress, it seems some companies are making plans for what their workplace structure will look like in the future - and that includes Ubisoft. 
Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier earlier this week tweeted that Ubisoft had emailed employees about a new &quot;hybrid&quot; work structure, and Ubisoft has now published this email on its official website.
&quot;In summary the future will be hybrid, offering the majority of Ubisoft team members the opportunity to balance home and office work,&quot; the post explains. &quot;This has been designed based on our learnings from the past year and from your feedback; this &#x27;test and learn&#x27; approach is one we will continue to adopt moving forward.&quot;

                    <span>After a string of rumours, whispers and leaks EA has finally lifted the veil of the latest Battlefield, seeing the flagship first-person shooter moving away from the historical setting of recent entries to a near-future backdrop - with this year&#x27;s model subsequently called Battlefield 2042. In a break from other recent traditions, it&#x27;ll also do away with a single-player campaign, and there are no plans for an accompanying battle royale mode.
Battlefield 2042 will instead focus on its multiplayer offering, supporting 128 players on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game support 64 players. There will also be the option of playing against AI bots, either solo or with a squad of friends. 
&quot;I think that&#x27;s just something that enables us to really lean into what we are best at,&quot; Battlefield 2042 design director Daniel Berlin told Eurogamer about the lack of a single-player campaign - something that&#x27;s been a series mainstay since Battlefield 3. &quot;If you look at the DNA of the studio, what we&#x27;ve been doing for so long, we just said you know what, we&#x27;re not going to have a traditional single-player campaign this time around, but we&#x27;re going to put all that emphasis and all those resources into building depth into the multiplayer. Because that is what we do best.&quot;

                    <span>Sony has released an update for the PlayStation 5 and the DualSense controller.
The update, which brings the PS5 up to version 21.01-03.20.00 (just rolls off the tongue!) makes a short list of changes, as detailed on the PlayStation website:
Of note is the update to the DualSense controller. Sony said it improves stability, which isn&#x27;t particularly helpful. Redditor Heymodspleasehelp noticed a controller battery indicator bug was now fixed. &quot;It was at zero percent before I updated now it&#x27;s at two bars,&quot; they said.

German player Marco Reus is also joining Epic&#x27;s beautiful game, and the two will come with the usual array of emotes and back blings. 
Harry Kane has an emote named &quot;HurriKane&quot;. That&#x27;s some top punning there.

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s laid back Team Rumble mode has been quietly revamped as part of the game&#x27;s new extraterrestrial season - and fans aren&#x27;t best pleased with the changes. 
Tweaks to Team Rumble&#x27;s relaxed formula had felt overdue, as things had begun to feel a little too relaxed in recent months and it had become common for matches to peter out towards the end. 
But Epic&#x27;s unexplained changes - apparently designed to speed up the mode&#x27;s pacing and match length - have gone overboard, fans say, and ruin the ability to use Team Rumble to check off in-game challenges.

                    <span>Just in time for the launch of Marvel&#x27;s new Disney+ show Loki, the Disney+ 30-day trial has returned to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving members a free month of access to the streaming service. 
As explained on Xbox Wire, the free trial can be claimed through Xbox Game Pass Perks, and can be activated any time from now until 30th September. If you claimed the previous Disney+ Perk, you should still be able to claim this one - but it can only be activated on a new Disney+ subscriber account. 
If you&#x27;re thinking of only using the trial for that 30-day period, remember that like most subscription trials you&#x27;ll need to manually cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period if you don&#x27;t want to get charged for the next month. So if you&#x27;re planning on tuning in just for Loki, you might want to wait a bit before activating your trial: the first episode releases today, but the finale airs on 14th July. Or for Clone Wars spin-off series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, you&#x27;ll want to make sure your trial period includes the finale airing on 30th July.

                    <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s The Division franchise will be absent from E3, the publisher has said. 
There were hopes we&#x27;d get more information on Heartland, the upcoming free-to-play The Division spin-off due later in 2021 or early in 2022. 
This is the first of Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming big budget free-to-play experiments with its core franchises. A few bits and pieces have leaked out from closed testing, despite Ubisoft&#x27;s wishes.

                    <span>We&#x27;re still waiting for that big Heath and Home update, but in the meantime developer Iron Gate has rolled out another small patch to fix some of Valheim&#x27;s bugs. This patch makes two previously-bugged raid events actually trigger in-game, and provides a number of other handy fixes to make your time in the 10th world slightly easier. Slightly. 
The two events fixed in this update are &quot;you are being hunted&quot; and &quot;the horde is attacking&quot;, which were previously in the game files but didn&#x27;t trigger as expected. According to the Valheim wiki, the hunt event is supposed to spawn a bunch of wolves, while the horde event should summon a goblin army of Fulings (including Berserkers and Shamans). 
The exact conditions for triggering these events are currently unknown, but the pattern established by previous events suggests the hunt event could require killing one wolf and Moder, while the horde raid should occur in-between killing Moder and the final boss. So if you&#x27;re currently in the late-game, things are about to get a bit spicier.

                    <span>Bandai Namco will hop onto E3 2021&#x27;s virtual stage next Tuesday 15th June at 10.25pm UK time, as part of the online event&#x27;s livestream.
All eyes will be on the publisher for word of Elden Ring, the much-hyped collaboration between Souls developer FromSoftware and Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin.
Reports swirled earlier this year of a proper look at Elden Ring being imminent - though for whatever reason, this never ended up coming to pass.

                    <span>When you talk about AWS billing, you’re talking about AWS architecture. Most folks don’t recognize that they’re the same thing.

                    <span>Henry Farrell and I published a paper on fixing American democracy: “Rechanneling Beliefs: How Information Flows Hinder or Help Democracy.”
It’s much easier for democratic stability to break down than most people realize, but this doesn’t mean we must despair over the future. It’s possible, though very difficult, to back away from our current situation towards one of greater democratic stability. This wouldn’t entail a restoration of a previous status quo. Instead, it would recognize that the status quo was less stable than it seemed, and a major source of the tensions that have started to unravel it. What we need is a dynamic stability, one that incorporates new forces into American democracy rather than trying to deny or quash them...</span>

                    <span>Developer RageSquid&#x27;s extreme downhill biking game Descenders is now available on Xbox Series X/S, bringing with it a free next-gen enhancements update for all Xbox One owners that introduces a 120fps mode, PC cross-play, and more.
Descenders, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, serves up an exhilarating freeriding experience as players - either solo or competitively - race, trick, and flip their way across a procedurally generated world. It was warmly received at launch, but really made its mark - and found a significant audience - once it released on Xbox Game Pass.
Following the game&#x27;s well-deserved, and continuing, success on Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service, RageSquid announced it was working on a next-gen enhancements upgrade for Xbox Series X/S - and that update is now finally here.

                    <span>Playdate, the mini monochrome handheld with a crank, will become available for pre-order in July priced $179 (UK price TBA). 
The exact date will be announced closer to the time, with a week&#x27;s warning so you can be ready. The first units are &quot;expected&quot; to ship later in 2021.
Those details are different to those first announced back in May 2019, when the price was mentioned as $149. But Playdate&#x27;s offering has now been improved, with a 4GB memory instead of 2GB, and an initial 24 game season: double the games originally planned.

                    <span>You may have already seen some mutterings about this on social media, but E3&#x27;s online portal opened up to press this week - and to nobody&#x27;s surprise, it&#x27;s a real mess. This year&#x27;s E3 is all-online thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the portal is supposed to be some sort of substitute for the physical show, featuring virtual booths for exhibitors, online events, and a variety of articles and bits of content about games.
The portal goes a little further than you might expect, however, with old-school internet forums, an avatar system and a gamified rewards system. The latter is what really caught my attention, as not only can you earn points from nosing around the portal, but you can also compete in online leaderboards  to see who is The Biggest E3 Fan. Naturally, this appealed to my competitive side and I set out to land myself a spot at the top of the virtual podium. &quot;With a limited pool of games media, this will be a cinch,&quot; I thought. But alas, my attempts to do so were foiled by an unexpected enemy: the E3 portal itself. 
Things started off pretty well. After doing some strange password reset shenanigans to actually get into my account, the E3 website presented me with an avatar creator (if you&#x27;ve ever heard of a picrew, it&#x27;s basically that). I don&#x27;t know why the avatar creator exists, but I think it might also be the best part of the E3 website. It&#x27;s surprisingly lenient with what it will allow you to do - there are colour wheels for your hair and eyes, and you can even move your facial features around. Don&#x27;t expect the sort of silliness you can get from something like Nintendo&#x27;s Mii Maker, but the E3 avatar creator isn&#x27;t afraid to get a little weird:

Expect updates on what&#x27;s next for Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise, as well as a look ahead to July&#x27;s Monster Hunter Stories 2 and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
So, what do we expect for Resident Evil Village? Well, Capcom is yet to talk about post-launch single-player support for the game, if there is any. More likely, perhaps, we may get a glimpse of new bits and pieces coming to its PVE Mercenaries mode.

                    <span>Is your Russian feeling a little rusty? Not to worry, as an English translation for Fallout 2 mod Olympus 2207 has finally been released - so you can put the Russian dictionary down for now. 
Olympus 2207 is a huge total conversion mod for Fallout 2 that was released back in December 2014, and at long last, it now has an official English translation. The developers used Fallout 2&#x27;s engine and basic mechanics to create a new story that&#x27;s unconnected to the Fallout series: it adapts features like Fallout 2&#x27;s skills and perks system, but adds new graphics, additional gameplay mechanics, and - of course - a bunch of new stories and quests. There&#x27;s even a crafting system, a mini-game for hacking electronic panels, and a flexible structure with no main quest. &quot;Do you want to become the tyrant of Radius, or do you want to improve the lives of everyone in it?,&quot; the official mod page explains. &quot;The choice is yours!&quot;
As explained in the lore section of the mod&#x27;s website, the game takes place in the year 2207 in the Silicon Valley region of the US. The Great War of 2013 created an irradiated wasteland, and while some managed to escape into improvised shelters (or a luxurious vault called Livos), many had to &quot;adapt to the new conditions on the evolutionary, genetic level&quot;. Sounds rough. Anyway, some lucky survivors found themselves inside a skyscraper called Olympus when this all went down. The game centres on this skyscraper, which everyone in the wasteland seems desperate to enter: it promises energy with its solar panels and protection from the horrors outside. If you can get past the guards at the bottom, however.

                    <span>Fortnite has beamed down its extra-terrestrial-themed Chapter 2 Season 7, which lets your ride UFOs and play as Superman.
There&#x27;s also a revamped battle pass system which has done away with the traditional levels 1-100 grind. Instead, levelling will give you &quot;Stars&quot; to spend on specific rewards you want, laid out over pages. Some items will require you to have finished off the rest of the page first, tempting you to level up further, but this should make nabbing individual items easier.
In the story trailer, we see the Fortnite island&#x27;s inhabitants react to the arrival of an Independence Day-sized UFO, which hovers over the island and then appears to suck up its Zero Point energy source, destroying last season&#x27;s Spire and primal ruins in the process.

                    <span>“If you think any of these systems are going to work as expected in wartime, you’re fooling yourself.”
That was Bruce’s response at a conference hosted by U.S. Transportation Command in 2017, after learning that their computerized logistical systems were mostly unclassified and on the internet. That may be necessary to keep in touch with civilian companies like FedEx in peacetime or when fighting terrorists or insurgents. But in a new era facing off with China or Russia, it is dangerously complacent.
Any 21st century war will include cyber operations. Weapons and support systems will be successfully attacked. ...</span>

                    <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has been delayed twice since its initial unveiling last September, now won&#x27;t arrival until some time next year.
Originally, the Sands of Time remake - which is being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai - was due to launch this January, but the publisher postponed its release to March at the end of last year. When February arrived, however, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the game once more, this time indefinitely, while it worked on delivering &quot;a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original&quot;.
All&#x27;s been quite on the news front since then, but in a new statement posted to Twitter - ostensibly confirming that the remake will be absent from this year&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream - the publisher has shared a revised release window of 2022 for the remake.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a new update for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition - and you&#x27;ll want to have it downloaded smartish if you&#x27;re looking to save your eardrums. 
Yes, those deafening mass relay jumps are now quieter - something many fans had called on BioWare to fix for years.
Mass Effect&#x27;s intergalactic jump points have always been noisy, though the otherwise excellent Legendary Edition has surprised some newer players (or those yet to experience hearing loss) when they find out how loud mass relays are.

The co-op shooter will see a gameplay reveal during the Ubisoft Forward event, which is set for 8pm UK time on 12th June.
The development team at Ubisoft announced the final name for the game in the video below:

                    <span>Royal Games, an online games portal owned by Candy Crush maker King, has come under fire from paying customers who have been unable to cash out their funds. 
The freeze on withdrawals was a consequence of King being investigated by PayPal over how Royal Games operates in specific countries. 
After a lengthy investigation by Eurogamer, the site&#x27;s withdrawal page has now become available again, though the site continues to no longer accept real-world money deposits.

Other Android TV devices will also get Stadia support on the same date - the full list of officially supported screens and devices lies below. 
Even if your telly isn&#x27;t on the list, you can &quot;opt into experimental support&quot; to play Stadia, though &quot;not every Android TV OS device will work pefectly&quot;, Google warns.

                    <span>At the start of the weekend we heard that CD Projekt&#x27;s stolen data was being shared online, and it seems the floodgates are now well and truly open. A bunch of dev-made bug compilation videos are now circulating on social media and file-sharing sites, showing some rarely-seen work-in-progress builds and rather spectacular bugs.  
As Eurogamer reported on Friday, some dev videos had already started to leak alongside the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker, and it appears many of these are now being shared on 4chan, Reddit and YouTube. Most of the videos are being shared using video hosting platform Streamable, but many are now being pulled offline (they are, after all, the result of an illegal ransomware hack). 
Some are short clips showing the player-character being ricocheted into the sky to the sound of Shooting Stars, or being knocked out only to wake up to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim opening. Others are more complex - one compilation shows several bugs with an off-tune recorder version of Spoiler (the track by DJ Hyper used in Cyberpunk&#x27;s 2018 E3 trailer). Another lengthy edit called &quot;CyberElBuggado2020&quot; shows hotdog motorbikes, NPCs T-posing to the sound of Thriller, and Johnny Silverhand saying &quot;this is going to be a disaster&quot; in Spanish.

More than $393k has been raised of a $500k funding target, with the bundle on sale for five more hours. 42,000 people have contributed so far, and you can pay more - or less - if you so choose.
All profit goes to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides food and emergency health protection to those in the region. You can read more about the UNRWA&#x27;s work here.

In a ruling delivered today, the court sided with Van Buren and overturned his 18-month conviction.
In a 37-page opinion written and delivered by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the court explained that the “exceeds authorized access” language was, indeed, too broad.
Justice Barrett said the clause was effectively making criminals of most US citizens who ever used a work resource to perform unauthorized actions, such as updating a dating profile, checking sports scores, or paying bills at work...</span>

                    <span>The Medium has been rated for PlayStation 5.
Gematsu spotted The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has rated The Medium for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series (presumably that means Xbox Series X and S).
Bloober Team&#x27;s well-received third-person psychological horror game The Medium launched digitally for Xbox Series X and S and PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store in January, as well as via Xbox Game Pass.

                    <span>Sonic creator Yuji Naka has confirmed his exit from Square Enix, and said he may retire.
In a tweet, Naka said he left Square Enix at the end of April. Balan Wonderworld, which Naka directed and Square Enix published on multiple platforms in March, flopped at retail. It sold less than 2100 copies in its opening week in Japan, and failed to make the top 40 in the UK physical chart.
On his departure from Square Enix, Naka said: &quot;I can&#x27;t talk about the reason now, but I hope I can talk about it when the time comes. As for future activities, I&#x27;m 55 years old, so I may retire.&quot;

                    <span>PlayStation 5 exclusive Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart weighs in at a nimble 33GB.
That&#x27;s 33.618GB, to be exact, according to Twitter account @PlaystationSize.
I expected Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart to take up more of my PS5 SSD, so it comes as a welcome surprise to see Insomniac&#x27;s adventure arrive on the smaller side.

                    <span>An artist has alleged Capcom stole her photos in the creation of Resident Evil and Devil May Cry games.
As reported by Polygon, designer Judy A. Juracek filed a lawsuit in a Connecticut court on Friday that alleges Capcom used unlicensed copyrighted photos for the creation of some of its games - and even for the Resident Evil 4 logo.
At the heart of this lawsuit is Juracek&#x27;s book, Surfaces, a visual research for artists, architects and designers that includes 1200 photographs of textures she took herself. Surfaces, which was originally published in 1996, includes a CD-ROM of the images, which require a licence for commercial use.

                    <span>Indie publisher Devolver Digital will host an E3 livestream at 9.30pm UK time on Saturday, 12th June.
It&#x27;s part of Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest.
There&#x27;s no word on what to expect from the show, although I suspect it will follow the same unhinged theme of previous Devolver Digital E3 shows.

                    <span>Shin Megami Tensei 5&#x27;s release date and gameplay details have leaked ahead of an expected appearance at Nintendo Direct during E3.
PersonaCentral.com spotted the Japanese website for the Nintendo Switch exclusive RPG briefly listed an 11th November 2021 release date, alongside story and gameplay information.
This information is expected to be revealed officially during the Nintendo Direct on 15th June, given all previous Shin Megami Tensei 5 information has been announced during Nintendo events. The Shin Megami Tensei 5 trailer released last July is below:

                    <span>Marvelous and Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s cult-hack-and-slash adventures No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle are heading to Steam next Wednesday, 9th June.
First released on Wii in 2007, No More Heroes follows the stylish, frequently ludicrous, and dependably ultra-violent adventures of Travis Touchdown, an ordinary game and anime geek who inadvertently becomes embroiled with the United Assassins Association.
What follows is a third-person hack-and-slash romp, replete with a phenomenal soundtrack, that sees Travis - lightsaber-like beam Katana in hand - murdering his way through the Association&#x27;s top-ranked assassins in order to stay alive. If you&#x27;ve never played the game before, expect geysers of blood, a winningly weird sense of humour, and (rather barren) bike-based open-world interludes in amongst the spirited and largely entertaining action.

                    <span>Following its surprise appearance during a fiscal year financial presentation last week, publisher 505 Games has confirmed that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the acclaimed 2019 Castlevania spiritual successor from Koji Igarashi and developer ArtPlay, is getting a sequel.
Word of a sequel originally surfaced after keen-eyed internet sorts spotted a bullet point inserted into 505 Games&#x27; latest fiscal year financial results, stating a &quot;second version&quot; of  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was in development.
Although the term &quot;second version&quot; left a certain ambiguity as to whether this was referring to a sequel or something else, 505 has now offered clarity in a development update on Reddit. &quot;Regarding recent reports,&quot; it wrote, &quot;[505 Games and Artplay] are in very early planning stages for a Bloodstained sequel&quot;.

                    <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick, which will once again be an online-only event due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, starts in exactly one month&#x27;s time, on 4th July, and in preparation, organisers have shared the full charity speedrun schedule.
2021 marks the second year running that Summer Games Done Quick is going online-only - traditionally, shows have been ticketed real-world events, with all speedrunning showcases being streamed online - and the precautions established last year will remain in place to &quot;ensure the continued safety of our attendees, runners, volunteers, and staff&quot;, according to organisers.
Even without the live-event element, there&#x27;s still plenty to look forward to, with this year&#x27;s show offering a full seven days of speedrunning, from Sunday, 4th July, to 11th July.

                    <span>Earlier this year, CD Projekt confirmed it had been hit by a &quot;targeted cyber attack&quot; that saw its internal systems compromised and sensitive information held to ransom. After CD Projekt said it would not comply with the group&#x27;s demands, the hackers announced that source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent and an unreleased version of The Witcher 3 would be auctioned to the highest bidder, and source code for Gwent was publicly leaked. 
At the time, the hackers claimed they had received a satisfying offer for the information, and the auction was then closed with a condition of &quot;no further distribution&quot; agreed with the buyer. But that stolen data now appears to have resurfaced, with source code, assets and software development kits for platforms including the PlayStation 5 seemingly being shared online. Eurogamer has also seen internal development videos showing work-in-progress builds of Cyberpunk 2077. 
According to security blog DataBreaches.net, earlier this week a threat actor group decided to release CD Projekt&#x27;s information in order to promote its new leaks platform. A note from the hackers was also discovered by security software provider Emsisoft back in March (via IT Pro), and an uncensored version of this was shared on 4chan yesterday (the link provided in the note no longer works, but the data is now being shared elsewhere). The note claims the release of the stolen information is part of a &quot;charity fundraising&quot; effort - although as the group is asking for payment in cryptocurrency, there&#x27;s no way to guarantee that&#x27;s actually going to a good cause.

Its parent company Koch Media plans a livestream with new announcements for Summer Games Fest, but Deep Silver&#x27;s games will not be a part of it, or any other E3 2021 event.
&quot;We&#x27;ll let you know when we have news to share,&quot; the Deep Silver Twitter account said.

                    <span>New Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players now need to pay for ranked play, Valve has announced.
Previously, new players of the free-to-play competitive first-person shooter had access to drops, ranks, skill groups, and a free path to Prime (paid) matchmaking.
Valve said that over time, these benefits had become &quot;an incentive for bad actors to hurt the experience of both new and existing players&quot;.

                    <span>The developer of Injustice 2 Mobile has apologised for a Pride event that challenged players to beat up a queer woman.
The mobile version of NetherRealm&#x27;s fighting game was accused of being &quot;tone deaf&quot; after an in-game challenge designed to celebrate Pride Month tasked players with defeating canonically bisexual character Poison Ivy hundreds of thousands of times.
Rewards for completing the community challenge included Harley Quinn tokens - a nod to Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn&#x27;s romantic relationship in DC Comics.

The leak first appeared on reddit and was subsequently verified by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier.
As you&#x27;d expect, NBA 2K22 is on the cards. According to the leak, ex-NBA pro Dirk Nowitzki is one of the cover stars.

SHB is a small, annual, invitational workshop of people studying various aspects of the human side of security, organized each year by Alessandro Acquisti, Ross Anderson, and myself. The forty or so attendees include psychologists, economists, computer security researchers, sociologists, political scientists, criminologists, neuroscientists, designers, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, business school professors, and a smattering of others.

                    <span>Sony has once again turned its attention to virtual reality of the PlayStation kind, with another of its PSVR showcases - and if you missed its various announcements, you can catch up below.
First up, Sniper Elite VR - unsurprisingly a virtual reality spin on developer Rebellion&#x27;s long-range FPS series - will be launching on 8th July. The studio is promising a &quot;powerful World War 2 story&quot; told through the eyes of an Italian Partisan, said to deliver a &quot;new perspective&quot; on the franchise&#x27;s acclaimed stealth and sniping action.
Next up is a reveal for new game Wanderer, created by M Theory and Oddboy. This one&#x27;s an immersive time travel adventure - melding narrative-driven exploration, puzzling, and mini-games - in which you&#x27;re able to embody some of history&#x27;s most famous explorers, inventors, and conquerors as you hop back and forth between ancient civilisations, war time, the hippie-hued 60s, even the far flung, post-apocalyptic future. Wanderer is due to arrive this summer.

                    <span>Rust is infamous for having a pretty hostile player base - something I learned the hard way when I first started playing - but a change arriving this month could make it easier to avoid your worst neighbours. A new &quot;contact system&quot; is being rolled out as part of Rust&#x27;s June update, and it will highlight those who have done bad things to you. 
&quot;Upon meeting a new player they&#x27;ll be logged into your contacts and the contact system will now keep a history of all interactions (good, bad, indifferent, rage-inducing etc),&quot; Facepunch explained in a press release. &quot;To help quickly identify friend from foe, players&#x27; nameplates will now display blue for friendly and red for hostile. Waving at players will reveal your name (it doesn&#x27;t always pay to be nice...) and using binoculars will reveal if a player is unknown, hostile or friendly from large distances.&quot;
On the surface, it sounds similar to the way hostile players are marked in Red Dead Online with a red dot or star depending on their recent actions. With Rust, however, it seems like it will be up to the individual to categorise other players: you can designate someone as an enemy, for instance, and make notes on each player you meet. Seems like a handy way to keep track of all those nakeds.

                    <span>Frontier has released a second major update for space sim Elite Dangerous&#x27; poorly received Odyssey expansion, bringing a raft of much-needed improvements, ranging from UI enhancements and graphics optimisations to AI tweaks and many, many bug fixes.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched last month, quickly accruing a &#x27;Mostly Negative&#x27; rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.
As the negative reviews continued, Frontier Developments boss David Braben stepped in, releasing a statement apologising &quot;to those who have been suffering from these problems&quot; and insisting that addressing Odyssey&#x27;s myriad reported issues was the studio&#x27;s &quot;priority and focus.&quot;

Creative Assembly didn&#x27;t stop there. The UK developer announced Skarbrand as a Legendary Lord for Khorne in the upcoming Total War: Warhammer 3.

The DLC, due out in July, reworks the Beastmen race &quot;to more closely match their intended playstyle and address their previous issues with horde gameplay&quot;, Creative Assembly said.
&quot;With a big focus on progression the Beastmen have a much more engaging and lasting experience.&quot;

                    <span>Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate is coming back with a new game nearly 25 years after the last one.

Frontier is publishing Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters under its Frontier Foundry games label. The game itself is developed by Canadian studio Complex Games, which has previously focused on mobile games such as The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault.

                    <span>Ubisoft has said its E3 show will feature Rainbow Six Quarantine, Far Cry 6, Riders Republic &quot;and some surprises that you won&#x27;t want to miss&quot;.
Ubisoft Forward, which is set for 8pm UK time on 12th June, will showcast the game formerly known as Rainbow Six Quarantine. 
Over an hour of gameplay from Rainbow Six Quarantine leaked from a technical test in March. (Then, the game was referred to as its codename: Rainbow Six: Parasite.) Ubisoft said the Quarantine name will change as a result of the ongoing pandemic.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been casting a curious eye at developer 11 Bit Studios&#x27; celebrated post-apocalyptic city builder Frostpunk but have yet to experience its brutal survival charms, now&#x27;s the perfect time to do so, as it&#x27;s currently free on the Epic Games Store.
Frostpunk, which launched to much acclaim in 2018, is a fascinating, if decidedly gruelling, experience. It&#x27;s a sort of narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder, challenging players to stay alive and, as much as is possible in Frostpunk&#x27;s desolate sub-zero world, thrive.
That&#x27;s done by establishing a settlement with a vast generator at its centre, a precariously fuel-hungry device intended to provide some degree of warmth for your population as, at your command, they set about scavenging the land for supplies needed to expand their new home.

                    <span>Crowfall, a player versus player MMO you can win and lose, finally has a release date: 6th July. And you can gain immediate access to it now by signing up for the beta.
It&#x27;s an MMO I&#x27;ve been following since it Kickstarted in 2015 (after which it raised more money via player investment and in-game property sales), and one I&#x27;ve played a bit of recently. It&#x27;s a slightly tricky one to explain.
In general, it&#x27;s an online fantasy game about fighting other players. That is the point. There&#x27;s a bit of monster fighting, but only really to serve as a tutorial while you quickly level up. There&#x27;s a level-cap of 30 which you can get quite close to in a few hours if you&#x27;re speedy.

                    <span>With just a week to go until the still-rather-nebulous E3 2021, its organiser the ESA has issued a rough guide on what to expect via its livestreams each day.
Alongside concrete press conference details already announced separately by certain companies (Microsoft, Ubisoft, Nintendo), there are mentions of various publisher presentations which will slot into E3 2021 programming.
Hopefully we&#x27;ll get a clearer timeframe for everything over the next week.

                    <span>Over the past few months, Apex Legends players have increasingly reported problems with DDoS attacks in their games: one moment they&#x27;ve been sliding their way around World&#x27;s Edge, the next, their game has frozen and they&#x27;ve been booted out. It&#x27;s become a particular issue in Ranked games, where miscreants have used DDoS attacks to artificially boost themselves up the leaderboards. Hoovering up a bunch of disconnected opponents is easier than actually playing the game, after all. 
Respawn has already indicated it&#x27;s taking the situation seriously - banning some behind high-profile cases, and mentioning that it&#x27;s even considering legal action against those carrying out the attacks. But it seems progress is being made towards a more permanent solution, with security analyst Conor &quot;Hideouts&quot; Ford explaining on Twitter that significant progress has been made on a fix. 
&quot;The DDoS situation is being addressed as we speak by our very own @ricklesauceur [lead software engineer Samy Duc],&quot; Ford said. &quot;It isn&#x27;t the easiest fix in the world but huge steps are being made to take care of this.&quot;

                    <span>Lego will hold its first ever announcement livestream, Lego Con, on 26th June at 5pm UK time.
Expect Lego set reveals for video game franchises such as Minecraft and Super Mario, as well as other top-selling ranges like Harry Potter, Technic, Star Wars and Dots. 
We already know Lego Super Luigi will launch on 1st August, so we&#x27;re likely to see what&#x27;s next for the range - and presumably the next vast wave of accompanying bits and pieces due alongside Mario&#x27;s brother. Birdo please.

                    <span>Bend Studio, perhaps best known as the developer behind 2019&#x27;s post-apocalyptic bikes-and-zombies adventure Days Gone, has revealed it&#x27;s working on a new IP.
Days Gone - which initially launched on PS4 before making it way to PC earlier this year - was the studio&#x27;s first crack at a new IP since its acquisition by Sony in 2000; prior to that game, the developer was largely known for adapting the likes of Uncharted and Resistance for Sony&#x27;s handheld consoles, the PSP and Vita.
Announcing its next project in a statement on Twitter,  Bend wrote, &quot;We are beyond grateful for your support with Days Gone and are truly honoured by the amount of passion our community has shared with us for our world and characters. Your enthusiasm motivates us to continue to improve and create experiences that will last a lifetime.&quot;

                    <span>God of War: Ragnarok, which was originally announced for a PlayStation 5 release in 2021, has been delayed into next year, and will now also launch on PS4 .
Confirming the news on Twitter, developer Sony Santa Monica Studio explained it had made the decision to push God of War: Ragnarok&#x27;s release back into 2022 in order to maintain the &quot;safety and wellbeing&quot; of its team.
&quot;Since the release of the next God of War teaser last year,&quot; the full statement reads, &quot;we&#x27;ve been humbled by the amount of love our community has show us. We&#x27;re incredibly grateful so see so many people excited to experience the next chapter of Kratos and Atreus&#x27; journey&quot;.

                    <span>Nintendo will hold its big E3 Nintendo Direct on 15th June at 5pm UK time. 
The showcase will run for 40 minutes and focus &quot;exclusively on Nintendo Switch software&quot;, the company said, nodding to the rampant reports of an imminent Switch hardware reveal. 
Of course, we&#x27;re expecting that Nintendo Switch hardware reveal before E3 itself, paving the way for Nintendo and other developers to focus specifically on games during E3.

                    <span>Riot has announced Valorant Mobile.
The mobile version of the currently PC-only free-to-play competitive first-person shooter, which now has more than 14 million players each month, is in the works, but Riot did not say when it will come out, or reveal any images or gameplay.
Valorant launched on PC a year ago, on 2nd June 2020. Riot said it&#x27;s working on expanding the franchise, starting with Valorant Mobile, &quot;in order to bring Valorant to more players around the world.&quot;

                    <span>Hello Games&#x27; ceaselessly evolving exploratory space sim No Man&#x27;s Sky has just received another free update on all platforms; it&#x27;s called Prisms, and brings sweeping visual enhancements to the already striking sci-fi sandbox.
Prisms, No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s 17th named update since its release back in 2016, touches up the game&#x27;s visual presentation pretty much across the board. Planets, for instance, get enhanced weather effects - Hello Games highlights rain, which now refracts the light and causes surfaces to become slick and wet - while underground caves become more detailed, with improved lighting and volumetric fog.
Planetary fauna, meanwhile, has been overhauled with proper fur effects and, as a bonus, flying creatures - which were sadly neglected in No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s taming-based Companions update - can now be adopted and ridden through the sky.

Writing on the Mass Effect reddit, former BioWare designer Richard Boisvert explained the Easter egg was his creation, and there was a specific path players had to follow in order to see it properly. 
&quot;As far as I know no one ever stumbled upon it,&quot; Boisvert wrote.

The message had sat in the code of the original Java Minecraft for over a decade, added by long-departed creator Markus &quot;Notch&quot; Persson. It was never featured in the newer Bedrock version of the game available on consoles, mobiles and Windows.

                    <span>Biomutant developer Experiment 101 has, as promised, released an update for the game that makes significant changes.
Chief among them is the ability to shut the annoying narrator up. Biomutant&#x27;s incorporeal narrator is certainly pretty chatty, commenting on pretty much everything you do and translating everything anyone says. Prior to the release of this patch, while you were able to tone the narrator down, you couldn&#x27;t shut him up completely. Now you can.
Here are the relevant patch notes:

Renovations on the building are now underway to transform the factory into a &quot;Nintendo Gallery&quot; where products from throughout the company&#x27;s history will be showcased, alongside exhibits and other experiences (thanks, Nintendo Life).
The site was formerly Nintendo&#x27;s Uji Oguru Plant, a facility originally built in 1969 to print Hanafuda cards, before it became a customer service centre for product repairs.

The cut footage was found back in 2019 via an old VHS tape, but was in poor quality. Since then, a group has worked on restoring the long-lost version, which is now available to watch in full via the Internet Archive.
As officially released, Super Mario Bros. was 104 minutes. This new version - dubbed the Morton Jankel Cut in honour of its husband and wife director team - runs 125 minutes, with most scenes extended.

In a message to fans, producer Yasuyuki Oda said the ongoing struggle with coronavirus in Japan had set development back.
&quot;The development timeline we set out to reach in the beginning has been affected by the ever-still rising cases of COVID-19 within Japan,&quot; Oda said.

A glimpse into DarkSide’s secret communications in the months leading up to the Colonial Pipeline attack reveals a criminal operation on the rise, pulling in millions of dollars in ransom payments each month.
DarkSide offers what is known as “ransomware as a service,” in which a malware developer charges a user fee to so-called affiliates like Woris, who may not have the technical skills to actually create ransomware but are still capable of breaking into a victim’s computer systems...</span>

                    <span>Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis, the standalone-expansion-style next instalment in Sega&#x27;s long-running free-to-play online action-RPG series, will - following its beta last month - be making its way to Xbox and PC next Wednesday, 9th June.
Announced last summer, New Genesis is described as the &quot;next-generation&quot; of Phantasy Star Online 2, and catapults the action forward 1,000 years after the Oracle&#x27;s battle in PSO2.
Bundled alongside the base game, it includes a new graphics engine, enhanced character models, a new multi-weapon system, and, most notably, a &quot;wide-open battlefield&quot; with changing time and weather, traversable using new abilities like the Photon Dash and Photon Glide. There&#x27;s also cross-platform play, plus fully localised text and character voices in English.

                    <span>All three episodes of Life is Strange developer Dontnod&#x27;s well-received supernatural mystery adventure Tell Me Why are currently free on PC and Xbox.
Tell Me Why, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the picturesque Alaskan town of Delos Crossing - a task that ultimately forces them to confront their traumatic past.
What follows is a deft blend of supernatural mystery thriller and earnest, character-driven homecoming drama - there&#x27;s real beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists - that&#x27;s arguably Dontnod&#x27;s most assured, consistently enjoyable outing yet, even if its perhaps not quite as devastatingly memorable as its Life is Strange forebears.

&quot;However, when Alba finds out about plans to build a garish hotel on the site of the island&#x27;s nature reserve,&quot; explains UsTwo, &quot;she sets out to stop it!&quot;

                    <span>Far Cry 6 narrative director Navid Khavari has issued a lengthy statement on the politics of the game, following a backlash to a quote of his last week.

&quot;Our story is political,&quot; Khavari commented. &quot;A story about a modern revolution must be.&quot;

                    <span>Two Point Campus, a comedic university sim, is the next project from Two Point Hospital developer Two Point Studios.
That&#x27;s according to a Microsoft Store listing for the game which popped up online yesterday (thanks, VG247), and which has now been taken offline. 
Screenshots show normal university activities such as jousting and giant pizza cooking, as well as university buildings themed around Hogwarts-style castles and European city squares.

It&#x27;s gone on to sell 54,374 bundles and raise aid for the humanitarian efforts of Direct Relief, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), International Medical Corps, and GiveIndia.
&quot;Direct Relief is tremendously grateful to Humble Bundle and its community of passionate and generous people,&quot; Direct Relief said in a statement on the official website (thanks, The Gamer). &quot;Their collective efforts will translate to critically-needed medicines, supplies, and other resources to the hardest-hit communities in India and Brazil as they continue to battle rising cases of COVID-19.

                    <span>A cancelled Fallout 2 sequel by Black Isle studios is now available to play in Fallout New Vegas courtesy of a new PC mod.
The game - which at the time had been codenamed Van Buren - takes place in 2253 and had been set in the great Midwest Commonwealth over four states. Sadly, it was cancelled in 2003, and while New Vegas inherited some aspects from the game, the Revelation Blue mod doesn&#x27;t &quot;treat [Fallout: New Vegas] as cannon [sic] in any way&quot;.
&quot;The project&#x27;s goal is to remake Van Buren for Fallout New Vegas,&quot; explains the mod creator (thanks, PC Gamer).

                    <span>PlayStation 5 exclusive Destruction AllStars will get online bots.
In an update on the Destruction AllStars subreddit, developer Lucid outlined features due out for the action driving game. Chief among them is the addition of online bots.
Lucid acknowledged that the size of Destruction AllStars&#x27; community, spread out as it is across the world, means the game has peak times and low times of player activity for online matchmaking. The peaks tend to be around 5pm to 11pm UK time during weekdays, and 3pm to 2am UK time on the weekend.

The recently-released sci-fi survival battle royale hybrid has an experimental sandbox testing platform built into the game called ScavLab, and it&#x27;s in this that the test will take place tonight, from 7pm UK time.
This first public ScavLab event will allow thousands of players to gather together in a single, shared in-game communal hub. Developer Midwinter plans competitive sports mini-games, large-scale combat, as well as a live, digital AMA with CEO and co-founder Josh Holmes.

                    <span>Benoît Sokal, creator of the Syberia series, has died aged 66.
French video game company Microids said in a blog post that Sokal passed away on 28th May after battling a long-term illness.
Belgian comic book artist Sokal is perhaps best known in the world of video games for creating the Syberia adventure games. But his first game for Microids was 1999 adventure Amerzone, which was based on Sokal&#x27;s popular 1986 Inspector Canardo comic strip L&#x27;Amerzone .

                    <span>Creative Assembly is facing a vociferous backlash over its decision to end support for Total War: Three Kingdoms.
This week the British developer announced it had wrapped up work on Total War: Three Kingdoms with the 1.7.1 patch. No more DLC or patches will be released for the game, which broke series records upon launch in May 2019.
Total War: Three Kingdoms saw seven DLC releases over the course of two years, but many fans feel Creative Assembly quit the game too early - and before the release of a promised expansion that would build out the north of the map.

                    <span>Grounded will get &quot;larger and slightly less frequent&quot; updates from now on, developer Obsidian has said.
After a period of radio silence, the developer issued an update on its survival game, which launched in early access form in July last year.
&quot;We are approaching the one-year mark from the game preview / early access launch and we still have so much that we want to do for the game,&quot; Obsidian said.

                    <span>A new Microsoft Flight Simulator patch has reduced the game&#x27;s initial full download from over 170GB to 83GB.
In the patch notes for Sim Update 4, aka patch 1.16.20.0, the development team said it had performed optimisations for the initial full download of Microsoft Flight Simulator so the base game is 83GB instead of over 170GB.
It&#x27;s good news to see the game&#x27;s download halved, although 83GB is still a chunky old effort.

                    <span>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the acclaimed 2019 Castlevania spiritual successor from Koji Igarashi and developer ArtPlay, is getting a sequel.
That&#x27;s according to a single, and only mildly informative, slide found within publisher 505 Games&#x27; latest fiscal year financial results presentation (as spotted by Gematsu) - which, as well as noting that Bloodstained has now sold more than 1m copies, amassing over €30m in sales, confirms a &quot;second version&quot; is currently in development.
As Gematsu points out, &quot;second version&quot;, although a somewhat unusual turn of phrase in this context, appears throughout the presentation in conjunction with other properties that have confirmed sequels, such as One More Level&#x27;s action-parkour game Ghostrunner.

                    <span>UK chain GAME has launched an eye-catching offer to get Xbox Series S for less than £100 when you trade-in a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
But, tellingly, GAME&#x27;s terms and conditions for this offer make it clear that this is only open to the public - and not to &quot;trade&quot; resellers looking for a quick profit.
&quot;GAME reserves the right to refuse any offer to anyone believed to be representing a trade buyer/customer,&quot; the chain states. In other words, if you manage a CEX, no telling your staff to go upgrade dozens of knackered Xbox Ones for Series S to just resell the newer consoles for profit. This may well apply if you&#x27;re an organised scalper, too.

                    <span>It&#x27;s hardly the biggest discount of all time - Among Us is currently £3.99 on Steam and completely free on iOS and Android - but if you&#x27;ve been thinking about dipping a toe into Among Us on PC, you can now do so for free via the Epic Games Store. 
The social deduction game, which originally released in 2018 but became enormously popular during the lockdowns of 2020, is free as part of Epic&#x27;s ongoing Mega Sale (which lasts until 17th June). Those who have an Epic Games Store account can grab Among Us for free until 3rd June.
Once you&#x27;ve claimed the free game, you&#x27;ll have access to new map The Airship, and be able to play with friends on other platforms like Switch, Android and iOS. The game is due to arrive on PlayStation later this year, too, so hopefully there won&#x27;t be any problems with cross-play there.

                    <span>Company of Heroes 2 and Ardennes Assault are free to download and keep forever on Steam this weekend.
Relic&#x27;s superb World War 2 real-time strategy game and its standalone single-player campaign are free to download and keep via Steam now until 3rd June 2021.
2013&#x27;s Company of Heroes 2 is widely regarded as one of the best RTS games around. &quot;While Company of Heroes 2 sometimes makes you feel like you&#x27;re fighting the game as well as the enemy, if you take time to understand the systems at work beneath the carnage and pick and choose your battles wisely, you will ultimately be rewarded by a deep and enjoyable RTS,&quot; wrote Stace Harman in Eurogamer&#x27;s Company of Heroes 2 review.

                    <span>Merle Dandridge will reprise her role as Marlene in the TV show based on Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us. The Hollywood Reporter revealed the casting.
Marlene is the boss of the Fireflies, the resistance movement who fights for freedom against the military. She appeared in both The Last of Us games.
Dandridge joins Pedro Pascal (Joel) and Bella Ramsey (Ellie) on the cast of HBO&#x27;s upcoming show. Gabriel Luna plays Tommy, Joel&#x27;s younger brother. As already announced, Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann are writing the script for the series.

                    <span>Cyberpunk 2077 has a new game director - and it&#x27;s former creative director Gabriel Amatangelo. 
Amatangelo joined CD Projekt back in January 2020, and will now take over from former game director Adam Badowski. According to a report by GamesIndustry.biz, Badowski will now focus on other leadership duties within CD Projekt, including the company&#x27;s new &quot;strategic development framework&quot; that will see the Cyberpunk and Witcher brands developed in parallel. 
Before becoming a creative director for Cyberpunk 2077, Amatangelo also worked as a design director on Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC, and lead designer on several expansions for Star Wars: The Old Republic. Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s roadmap indicates that we should see several free DLCs for the game over the next year, and Amatangelo certainly has some experience in this area.

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s latest crossover is something nobody expected - well, except perhaps the author of the Mistborn book series, Brandon Sanderson. 
Mistborn character Kelsier became a Fortnite character last night, available via the Item Shop complete with in-game artwork and accessories. 
Fortnite has crossed over with dozens of comics, popstars, film and TV characters in the past. Kelsier, however, is the game&#x27;s first novel tie-in.

Without naming the game, Sega revealed this new Sonic game is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. The brisk accompanying trailer didn&#x27;t show anything beyond the hedgehog running through a forest, and a mysterious symbol:
Sonic fans soon poked around the trailer&#x27;s innards on the hunt for clues. Thankfully, Sega itself stepped in with a press release that names the game.

A crucial part of the Russians’ success was their ability to move through these organizations by compromising cloud and local network identity systems to then access cloud accounts and pilfer emails and files.
Hackers said by the US government to have been working for the Kremlin targeted a widely used Microsoft cloud service that synchronizes user identities. The hackers ...</span>

                    <span>Just as it promised, Sony has pulled back the veil on Guerrilla Games&#x27; highly anticipated Horizon Forbidden West, sharing 14 minutes of gorgeous gameplay running on PlayStation 5.
As you can see in the video below, it&#x27;s an immediate feast for the eyes, beginning as Aloy scrambles through dense jungle foliage before stumbling out onto a oceanside settlement, all sandy beaches, deep blue water, and vast rock spires on the horizon, shrouded in clouds. These, Guerrilla later confirms, are the remnants of San Francisco, millennia into the future, and it&#x27;s here that Aloy encounters machine-riding raiders, immediately embarking on some nimble combat, firing arrows and hurtling acrobatically around the environment to escape their attack.
This initial sequence ends beneath the waves as Aloy swims through gorgeous coral reefs, kelp, and exotic fauna, fighting the current as she goes. Eventually she reaches dry land and encounters the raiders once more, this time choosing to take a more stealthy approach as she attempts to liberate her kidnapped friend.

                    <span>Techland&#x27;s parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2, has - after a rather tumultuous few years of development - finally received a release date. It&#x27;ll be coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 7th December, and Techland has released a brand-new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.
Dying Light 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first game, in a world devastated by a mutated version of the original virus. With over 98% of the population now lost, the remnants of humanity have congregated in the sprawling metropolis of Villedor, also known as The City, and it&#x27;s here that new protagonist Aiden Caldwell finds himself while searching for his family.
To date, Techland has really only painted the ensuing adventure in broad strokes, talking up key points such as Dying Light 2&#x27;s 2-4 player co-op, its returning day and night cycle, and its focus on choice and consequence. Today&#x27;s developer livestream didn&#x27;t go too much further than those core concepts, but did flesh them out with a few additional details.

                    <span>Sonic&#x27;s 30th anniversary livestream has come and gone, leaving a big blue streak in its wake, and while it wasn&#x27;t perhaps the most revelatory of showings, Sega did at least confirm the previously rumoured Sonic Colors remaster and retro Sonic collection - as well as providing the tiniest teases of Sonic&#x27;s next major game.
Starting with the remaster, it&#x27;s called Sonic Colors Ultimate and will be heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (exclusively via the Epic Games Store) on 7th September this year.
As those who&#x27;ve played the 2010 original will know, Sonic Colors transports the iconic mascot to Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s interstellar theme park for a familiar blend of appropriately high-speed into-the-screen and side-on platforming, with the hedgehog able to access handy new skills, such as a speed boost or the ability to drill underground, thanks to friendly Wisps.

Our first look at polished Aragami 2 gameplay lies in the new trailer below, which shows a new threat for the Rashomon Valley and various ninja-inspired fights.
The original Aragami sold 700k copies and helped grow Lince Works as a studio, the developer said in a release today, meaning Aragami 2 is now the work of a more experienced and larger team. Combat has been overhauled, and looks sneakier than ever. Here&#x27;s a peek:

Today&#x27;s update reduces the cargo truck spawn rates for the battle royale&#x27;s solo mode to five (static) from a range of 16 to 20.
As Eurogamer reported earlier this month, Call of Duty: Warzone players have been using the 6x6 cargo truck vehicle to great effect in what&#x27;s dubbed the &quot;Big Bertha meta&quot;.

                    <span>Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said PlayStation cross-platform support has been cut from an upcoming Borderlands 3 patch - though without explaining why. 
In a tweet sent this afternoon, Pitchford said that while a Borderlands 3 update had been prepared for release &quot;that includes full crossplay support across all platforms&quot;, PlayStation will ultimately not be included.
Pitchford did not detail why, upon submitting the patch for certification, Gearbox was then forced to remove crossplay by the game&#x27;s publisher 2K. Did Sony suddenly decide to take issue with the game&#x27;s long-promised crossplay becoming a reality? Or did Gearbox and/or 2K decide not to play by Sony&#x27;s rules? Pitchford has so far chosen not to elaborate.

                    <span>Creative Assembly has wrapped up work on Total War: Three Kingdoms.
The 1.7.1 patch, which goes live today, marks the end of the British studio&#x27;s post-launch support for the popular strategy game, which saw seven DLC releases over the course of two years.
The development team has transitioned onto another project based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel, Creative Assembly said in a video to fans, below.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot more to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation investor relations document than confirmation Uncharted 4 is coming to PC.
The document, published as part of Sony&#x27;s 2021 investor relations day, focuses on the company&#x27;s Game &amp; Network Services Segment. It&#x27;s penned by PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, and includes a number of interesting bits of information that reveal Sony&#x27;s masterplan for its money-printing video games business.
At the beginning, Sony mentions it&#x27;s &quot;building our biggest-ever platform&quot; with PlayStation 5, and that it&#x27;s working to ensure &quot;our longest-ever tail&quot; with the PS4. PS5 has delivered PlayStation&#x27;s highest-ever launch sales, with 7.8m units sold as of the end of Sony&#x27;s last financial year (ending March 2021).

                    <span>Pokémon Go has detailed Go Fest 2021, its massive summer event weekend, which will offer an eye-catching array of creatures to capture for a particularly eye-opening price.
This year, tickets for the two-day affair cost just £5 (or $5), a third of 2020&#x27;s fee. Once again, there will be no physical event, and all players will be able to take part wherever they are. 
There will also be plenty to do for people who don&#x27;t purchase a ticket.

                    <span>A Battlefield 6 video meant for internal use at EA has leaked online.
The video, currently available to watch on the Battlefield subreddit (with an epilepsy warning), confirms a near future setting for the upcoming DICE-developed game.
We also hear soldiers shout, a rocket attempt to launch into space before collapsing onto the ground, and, at the end, a reveal of the title &quot;Battlefield&quot;.

                    <span>We know EA makes millions of dollars from Ultimate Team, but now we have a figure: $1.62bn.
That&#x27;s the eye-watering amount EA made during its 2021 financial year from Ultimate Team modes across its sports games.
But - and this won&#x27;t come as a surprise to anyone - FIFA Ultimate Team made the bulk of that money. Or, as EA recently put it in a regulatory financial document, &quot;a substantial portion&quot;.

                    <span>Sony has seemingly revealed Uncharted 4 is coming to PC.
In a document published as part of Sony&#x27;s Investor Relations day, Sony mentions Uncharted 4 under &quot;more PC releases planned&quot; (it&#x27;s on page 26).
Sony is putting more of its PlayStation 4 games on PC. It&#x27;s already released Guerrilla&#x27;s Horizon: Zero Dawn on PC and, most recently, Sony Bend&#x27;s Days Gone. It makes sense that Naughty Dog&#x27;s five-year-old adventure game would be part of Sony&#x27;s PC push.

I understand this is to ensure third-parties working on games which support the upgraded Switch are free to announce these projects at E3, and before Nintendo&#x27;s own digital showcase later in that week. 
(Nintendo&#x27;s event has yet to be formally dated but is currently set to slot in after other publishers towards the end of E3, though of course dates can still shift.)

                    <span>Dragon Quest celebrated its 35th anniversary in some style in the early hours of this morning, with a livestream from Japan heralding the announcement of a string of new entries and spin-offs for the much-loved RPG series.
Heading the lot was Dragon Quest 12, which will be the first mainline entry since 2017. Not much was shown beyond a brief trailer revealing a logo - though that logo did reveal a turn towards dark fantasy, and what series&#x27; creator dubbed a Dragon Quest &#x27;for adults&#x27;. It&#x27;s being primed for a simultaneous worldwide release - in what would be a first for a mainline entry - though the timing has yet to be revealed, while no platforms have been announced just yet. 
Elsewhere, a remake of Dragon Quest 3 was announced, taking on the 2D/3D stylings of the likes of Octopath Traveler - and being ushered into existence by Octopath Traveler producer Masaaki Hayasaka. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D, as it&#x27;s somewhat clumsily called at present, again has no release date or confirmed platforms, though it is also slated for a worldwide simultaneous release and we were afforded a look at it in action.

                    <span>We&#x27;re a little over two weeks away from this year&#x27;s attempt at an online-only E3, meaning everyone&#x27;ll soon be sinking into the familiar swamp of showcase schedules and diary dates required to keep track of the event and everything around it. Wisely starting early to avoid the ensuing scramble, though, Microsoft has announced a 13th June air date for this year&#x27;s E3-adjacent Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.
It&#x27;ll be a significant event for a number of reasons, not least because it&#x27;s the first joint announcement show for the two companies following Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Bethesda last year, and things kick off at 10am PT on Sunday, 13th June - which, for us UK folk, equates to an entirely tolerable 6pm in the afternoon. It&#x27;s a long one too, with Microsoft promising 90-minutes of announcements - hopefully that&#x27;s a taut 90 minutes with none of the waffly filler it usually loves to pad out its livestreams with (hello Inside Xbox, I&#x27;m looking at you).
As you&#x27;d expect, there&#x27;s little in the way of specific regarding the games we&#x27;ll be seeing - all the better to retain that all-important element of surprise - and Microsoft is merely teasing a look at the &quot;epic gaming lineup coming out of [the Bethesda] partnership, the incredible games coming to Xbox this holiday, upcoming releases on Xbox Game Pass, and more.&quot;

                    <span>Blizzard has officially cancelled its BlizzCon live event for the second year running, citing the &quot;ongoing complexities and uncertainties of the pandemic&quot;.
Last year&#x27;s real-world BlizzCon was cancelled due to coronavirus-related &quot;health and safety considerations&quot;, and its long-awaited digital-only replacement - formally titled BlizzConline - eventually took place in February this year. Since then, it&#x27;s been unclear if Blizzard was still planning to press ahead with a proper large-scale physical gathering in 2021, perhaps around the early November weekend usually reserved for its BlizzCon shows.
In a new post on the BlizzCon website, however, show executive producer Saralyn Smith has now confirmed the 2021 event will not be going ahead.

                    <span>Sonic the Hedgehog voice actor Roger Craig Smith has surprised fans by announcing he&#x27;ll once again be voicing the iconic character, four months after Sega confirmed his departure.
Smith - whose other notable video game roles have included Ezio Auditore da Firenze in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series, Chris Redfield in the Resident Evil series, Batman in Batman: Arkham Oranges, and Mirage in Apex Legends - had voiced Sonic since 2010, even lending his vocal talents to the character in the Wreck-it-Ralph films.
However, back in January, Smith tweeted, &quot;Welp, 10 years was an amazing run. Onward to new zones!&quot;, alongside an image of a broken blue heart. Sega later confirmed what fans had already suspected, announcing Smith&#x27;s departure from the Sonic role.

                    <span>With little fanfare and less than a month until its release, Sega has confirmed Olympic Games Tokyo 2020: The Official Video Game will arrive on 22nd June 2021. 
An officially-licensed compilation of 18 Olympic sport mini-games, it will launch for PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Stadia and Xbox.
Of course, it&#x27;s unsurprising Sega has left this news until so late. While the real-world Olympics are (currently) set to go ahead in July, a year later than originally planned, the debate continues on whether it is right to hold the games at all while many countries - not least its host, Japan - continue to struggle with the impacts of coronavirus.

                    <span>There&#x27;s normally a bit of tuning work to be done when a new legend is introduced to Apex Legends, and jetpack-wielding hero Valkyrie is no exception. Some of her flights are lasting a little longer than Respawn would like, it seems, and the developer has decided to clip her wings. 
As explained by associate live balance designer John Larson, players figured out that hovering with Valkyrie&#x27;s jetpack currently costs very little fuel - and were using this to &quot;take coffee breaks above the final fight in scrims&quot;. It reminds me a bit of when Fortnite players used planes to stay out of battles until the very last moment. 
In any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, Larson said that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this &quot;didn&#x27;t feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings.

Also of note: Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown launches on PS Plus and PlayStation Now. It is available to download on PS Plus for two months - June and July - and leaves Plus on 2nd August. The trailer is below:

                    <span>It&#x27;s hard to keep up with the amount of upcoming sequels and spin-offs for the PUBG universe - there&#x27;s that futuristic new mobile title called PUBG: New State, and space horror game The Callisto Protocol, which looks like a spiritual successor to Dead Space. And now there seems to be a western-themed PUBG game codenamed Project Cowboy on the way. 
South Korean media outlet Bloter spotted job adverts on Krafton&#x27;s website for an &quot;open-world shooting game&quot; that will release on console and PC as an independent title (via Google Translate). Krafton apparently told Bloter that &quot;Project Cowboy is a new IP game for Battleground developed by Krafton&quot;. PUBG dataminer PlayerIGN described it as &quot;PUBG&#x27;s western custom mode&quot; with &quot;old west guns only&quot;.   
Eurogamer contacted Krafton for comment, and was told the company has &quot;nothing to share on Project Cowboy as of now&quot;.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s latest free Title Update arrives tomorrow, 27th May, on Switch, bringing a new story ending, two formidable new opponents in the shape the Crimson Glow Valstrax and Apex Zinogre, new DLC, and more.
Crimson Glow Valstrax, if the name sounds familiar, is a new variant of the Elder Dragon first introduced in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, making its Rise debut with a new form and attacks. The beast is able to change the shape of it wings, notes Capcom, enabling it to fly freely through the sky and survive at unusually high altitudes.
As for the Apex Zinogre, it&#x27;s a tougher version of the familiar Monster Hunter staple already in Rise, and features a striking new look with its golden fur and lightning. Capcom says it&#x27;ll make an appearance in Rampage quests but can be tackled as part of a standard quest too.

The new games for Switch were announced back in February, and are essentially retro-style remakes of the original Diamond and Pearl games. In the overworld characters take on a chibi art style, but there are also full-size Pokémon battles. 
Another Sinnoh game arrives early next year, called Pokémon Legends Arceus, which sees players explore a more feudal version of the region with old school pokéballs - and you&#x27;ll be tasked with creating the first ever Pokédex.

As Tom reported when it was announced, Pokémon Legends Arceus is an open-world Sinnoh game set in a more feudal version of the region.
Old school Pokéballs and a mix of previous starter Pokémon feature, though how Pokémon Legends Arceus connects with the Pokémon God is under wraps. You&#x27;ll be creating the first ever Pokédex.

                    <span>That&#x27;s right, PUBG is getting another batch of fresh maps this year, as the dev team has unveiled its 2021 dev plan - and it includes two brand new locations along with a remaster for Miramar.
The first of these changes is the upcoming Miramar remaster, which is being rolled out in patch 12.1 (now live on PC test servers). Miramar has been tweaked and revamped before, but this time it&#x27;s getting a &quot;much larger remastering&quot;, using the technology used to improve other maps like Sanhok to tweak the &quot;lighting, performance, graphical fidelity, topography, and of course special features&quot;. 
Players can also expect to find &quot;overhauls to terrain and building textures and layouts, easier traversal with the removal of unnecessary obstacles, and even updated cliffs to better fit in the more vertical experience the game has become&quot;.

                    <span>Konami has secured a genuine exclusive on Atalanta from next season, forcing EA to come up with a fake name, badge and kits for the Italian club.
Konami said it had signed a long-term deal with Atalanta, who finished the season in third place, and it starts with PES 2022. The announcement trailer is below:
Konami is going hard on Serie A, and has signed similar deals for Roma, Napoli, and most significant of all, Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s Juventus, which forced rival EA Sports to come up with a fake name for the Old Lady in FIFA 20.

                    <span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has today received a small patch which fixes a couple of minor issues. It&#x27;s the first update for the game since January 2019.
Today&#x27;s patch makes two tiny changes to fix tournament points and match history from being reset. But it has also, again, sparked discussion among players wondering if a more significant update will ever follow.
Released back in 2017, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is Nintendo Switch&#x27;s best-selling game. Four years on, it continues to sell extremely well and has a near-permanent spot in the UK boxed game chart top 10.

In a post published Tuesday, SentinelOne researchers said they assessed with high confidence that based on the code and the servers Apostle reported to, the malware was being used by a newly discovered group with ties to the Iranian government. While a ransomware note the researchers recovered suggested that Apostle had been used against a critical facility in the United Arab Emirates, the primary target was Israel.</span>

                    <span>Valve is reportedly readying to enter the hardware market once more, this time with a new &quot;Switch-like&quot; handheld gaming PC that could potentially launch by the end of the year.
That&#x27;s according to a report by Ars Technica, which expands on the recent discovery of a new hardware-related code - referring to a mysterious device known as &quot;SteamPal&quot; - in the latest version of Steam. Citing &quot;multiple sources familiar with the matter&quot;, Ars Technica claims this device (whose final name remains unconfirmed) is a new Valve-developed all-in-one portable gaming PC that features gamepad controls and a touchscreen in a similar form factor to Nintendo&#x27;s Switch, albeit without detachable controllers.
SteamPal, or whatever it ends up being called (obviously, not calling it the Gabe Boy would be a serious missed opportunity), is reportedly designed to run a large number of games on the Steam PC platform via Linux, and can &quot;dock&quot; to a monitor via its USB Type-C port.

                    <span>The Magnificent Trufflepigs, a romantic first-person metal-detecting adventure from Andrew Crawshaw, lead designer on The Chinese Room&#x27;s Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture, now has a release date and will be making its way to PC next Wednesday, 2nd June.
Trufflepigs is the work of Crawshaw&#x27;s Leeds-based studio Thunkd (which says it wants to become synonymous with &quot;high-quality, short-form, &#x27;evening-sized&#x27; games&quot;), and tells the story of Adam - voiced by Doctor Who and Legends of Tomorrow&#x27;s Arthur Darvill - as he returns to his childhood home in the heart of the English countryside.
What follows is a game of laid-back metal detecting and exploration with a &quot;strong interpersonal narrative&quot; as Adam reunites with old friend Beth (played by Safe House and Another Eden&#x27;s Luci Fish) and joins her on a quest to find a local treasure connected to her past.

                    <span>Axiom Verge 2, the sequel to developer Thomas Happ&#x27;s acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like, is delayed again, and is now expected to launch in the latter half of this year.
Happ had initially planned to launch Axiom Verge 2 on PC and Switch at some point in 2020, but ultimately opted to postpone release into the first half of this year for a variety of reasons. That window was later narrowed to &quot;spring&quot;, but the developer has now announced an additional delay, pushing the game&#x27;s release back to &quot;Q3&quot; 2021 - indicating it&#x27;ll likely arrive between the start of July and the end of September.
&quot;I could go into a long spiel about why it&#x27;s taking longer than I originally forecast,&quot; Happ wrote in a post on his blog, &quot;but I don&#x27;t want to get too bogged down into technical details. Suffice it to say that the game will be better for the additional time, and I won&#x27;t have to burn myself out crunching to hit a date that I set for myself.&quot;

                    <span>Wondering what Sonic&#x27;s been up to lately? Well, it looks like Sega&#x27;s poised to reveal all in a 30th anniversary livestream for the prickly blue icon, scheduled to take place this Thursday.
Sonic Central, as Sega&#x27;s calling its digital showcase, gets underway at 5pm BST/9am PT this Thursday, 27th May, and promises a first look at a number of upcoming &quot;projects, partnerships, and events&quot; the company has been working on as part of its anniversary celebrations.
There&#x27;s no hint as to what those might be as yet, but recent rumours have suggested Sega is prepping both a new collection of classic Sonic titles and a remaster of the hedgehog&#x27;s 2010 outing Sonic Colors. Perhaps we&#x27;ll also finally get a glimpse of Sonic&#x27;s next major new game, which was confirmed to be in production back in 2019.

                    <span>It&#x27;s a busy day for developer Ion Lands; not only is its gorgeous Blade Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk&#x27;s &quot;sequel-sized&quot; paid DLC, City of Ghosts, now available on PC, the studio has announced a new cyberpunk-themed life-sim spin-off too.
City of Angels, which seems as good a place as any to start, offers a brand-new, fully voiced story campaign that serves as a direct sequel to the original game. Main protagonist Rania and canine companion Camus return for another skyhigh HOVA-based jaunt around the neon-drenched metropolis of Nivalis, but this time there&#x27;s a new hero - deadbeat gambler Hayse - with players switching between two interlinking stories as the adventure unfolds.
Ion Worlds says City of Angels is longer than the original story, as well as &quot;darker, tenser, more complex&quot;, and promises new areas to explore, new characters and mysteries, HOVA customisation, street racing, and different endings depending on player choices. It&#x27;s out now on Steam for £12.99/$14.99 USD, and there&#x27;s a 10% launch day discount.

                    <span>Remember bird dating sim Hatoful Boyfriend? It&#x27;s hard to forget, to be honest, but if you haven&#x27;t yet bought it on iOS, Android or the PlayStation Store then your time is limited, as the game is being delisted from these platforms at the end of May. 
Manga artist and Hatoful Boyfriend creator Hato Moa announced the news on her Twitter account earlier this week, explaining that both Hatoful Boyfriend and its seasonal sequel Holiday Star will no longer be purchasable on these platforms as &quot;publishing agreements on those platforms are coming to an end&quot;. Those who already bought the games through these platforms will still be able to use them, however, while the games will remain on sale via Steam. 
If you missed it the first time around, well, Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel about dating birds that was released back in 2014. I guess you can say it&#x27;s been out for aviary long time. You play as the only human student accepted into a school for birds, where you must navigate classes and build relationships with talking birds. It&#x27;s all pretty eccentric, but the game earned itself a cult following and critical acclaim for the quality of its character writing.

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s storyline has kicked back into gear as its primal-themed season draws to a close. Today brings map changes, new challenges, extra-terrestrial warnings, and several hints at what next season may bring.
This morning, Fortnite received update 16.50, the last patch expected before its next season on 7th June. Eagle-eyed fans immediately noticed several changes around the island: a crashed helicopter near the dam, posters showing UFOs and friendly aliens at the beach, and flattened corn at the farm. 
3pm UK time today brought a new set of &quot;Foreshadowing&quot; challenges live, where you&#x27;re asked to investigate that helicopter, as well as a series of smashed telescopes on the island. Does someone not want its inhabitants looking at the skies?

                    <span>A much-requested feature has finally been introduced to Apex Legends&#x27; Arenas mode, as the 3v3 team deathmatches now have a leaving penalty - something that should hopefully deter players from flaking on their squadmates. 
Several changes were announced via patch notes posted on Twitter, including the new abandon penalty for Arenas games. Respawn explained that this is similar to the penalty for Ranked Battle Royale games, and will apply to those who leave a full squad in the middle of a match. 
Unfortunately it seems a couple of people are currently getting unfairly punished by the new penalty, with some reporting being slapped with 10-minute sin bins for leaving during the end screen animations. Director of communications Ryan K. Rigney assured one player that the team was investigating the problem.

                    <span>Focus Home Interactive has released 15 minutes of Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Storm Ground gameplay.
The gameplay, which you can see in the video below, is narrated by game director Jeff Lydell and design director Ian Christy from developer Gasket Games. We see a small group of Stormcast Eternals during a mid-to-late battle of the campaign against a modest Nighthaunt army.
The Stormcast Eternals&#x27; numbers are few, so Lydell makes smart use of his units&#x27; skills as well as knowledge of the environment (pushback, high ground bonuses, lethal hazards etc) to win the assasination mission.

                    <span>After an agonisingly long hiatus Sega&#x27;s much-loved fighting series Virtua Fighter is back, with a remaster of the most recent game coming to PlayStation 4 next month. 
Virtua Fighter: Ultimate Showdown looks to be a remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, the last installment which hit arcades way back in 2010. Final Showdown was itself the last iteration of Virtua Fighter 5, folding in new characters Taka-Arashi and Jean Kujo as well as introducing a more athletic moveset for its cast. We wrote some nice things about it in our Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown review upon its console launch in 2012. 
Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown saw the series bow out at its peak, although it&#x27;s been kept alive in some way via appearances in the arcades of Sega&#x27;s hugely successful Yakuza games. Is this the mark of a grand return for Virtua Fighter? The trailer - exclusively hosted on IGN - suggests perhaps not, declaring that the ultimate 3D fighter is back for the final round, with this remaster coinciding with Sega&#x27;s ongoing 60th anniversary celebrations. Still, there remains hope and it&#x27;s a delight to see the series back in any form.

The trial wrapped up yesterday with some closing remarks from both parties, with Epic reiterating that the case would have an impact on the wider mobile games market and other developers (via GamesIndustry.biz). 
&quot;Epic acknowledges that this is an important case, that there&#x27;s an important set of conduct, and that a remedy... of the sort that Epic has requested would be important and significant,&quot; said Epic&#x27;s counsel Gary Bornstein. &quot;But that is because the issue affects such a large number of consumers, such a large number of developers, and has persisted for such a long period of time.&quot;

                    <span>Two months ago, Pokémon Go added a tier system to its loot box-style eggs, which for the first time gave some visibility to the chances of their contents.
This made sorting which eggs to hatch much easier, as it was now clear which were from specific events, and it was also a welcome first step to indicating the likelihood of getting a specific creature, something fans have been loudly calling out for over the past few years.
Now, with weeks of data to test, a group of more than 50 hardcore players at top fan community The Silph Road has analysed thousands of egg hatches to see how well the tier system matches up to reality - and there are some surprising findings.

The project still sounds far-off, and there&#x27;s no word on what has been holding up development - but the wheels now seem to be turning.
&quot;We actually do have a script that&#x27;s being written for the Portal movie now at [Warner Bros.],&quot; Abrams said today (thanks, IGN) &quot;We&#x27;re really excited about the take and the pitch, so it feels like that thing&#x27;s finally on the rails.

                    <span>Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, is coming to PC and Mac via Steam on 20th July, with a Switch release to follow early next year.
If you weren&#x27;t already aware, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club&#x27;s equally excellent underground railway builder Mini Metro, and, despite its shift in focus, takes a similarly minimalist approach to its tactile strategy action.
This time around, your goal is to construct an efficient road network - traffic lights, bridges, motorways, and all - to ensure commuters can travel from their home to their (same-coloured) destination before the timer runs out. New building items are awarded each in-game week so your ceaseless march of urban expansion may continue, and just like in Mini Metro, things can quickly become as fraught as they are soothingly low-key.

                    <span>American Truck Simulator now has official - albeit experimental - multiplayer support, courtesy of developer SCS Software&#x27;s latest open beta build, meaning digital truckers need truck the lonely trucking life no more.
Official multiplayer support, which SCS is calling Convoy for self-explanatory reasons, is available now as part of American Truck Simulator&#x27;s experimental beta update 1.41, and will be making its way to Euro Truck Simulator 2 at a later date.
Once installed, this initial work-in-progress version of Convoy will enable players to set-up and host their own private multiplayer session for up to eight trucking pals. Everyone in a session will see synchronised time, weather, and AI traffic - as well as their trucking buddies&#x27; paint jobs and truck accessories - and can undertake the same contracts from the same companies, all heading to the same destination. In-game communication options, if you need them, include CB radio broadcast, quick replies, and text chat.

                    <span>Amanita Design has given its much-loved point-and-click space adventure Samorost a surprise spruce-up in the form of a free new &#x27;enhanced&#x27; edition release on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.
Samorost, which originally released in 2003, serves up an engaging, if brisk, blend of point-and-click puzzling and toy-like tinkering as players follow the delightfully surreal interplanetary adventures of an adorable space gnome.
Samorost has been free to play via web browser for quite some time, but it&#x27;s now available as a free downloadable game on iOS and Android, as well as on PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io - meaning all three currently released Samorost titles (the latter two being more substantial paid offerings) are now accessible on the aforementioned storefronts for your amusement.

                    <span>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has released a lengthy statement meant to lay out the progress he says his company has made since last summer&#x27;s devastating reports of sexual harassment and toxic working environments within various teams across the business.
The post, published to Ubisoft&#x27;s blog, comes in the wake of a French report in Le Télégramme this month that claimed the company had made only minimal changes. Ubisoft rebutted some of that report at the time, while today&#x27;s statement from the very top of the company doubles down further.
&quot;Last June, we faced the fact that not all team members were experiencing the safe and inclusive workplace that we had always intended Ubisoft to be,&quot; Guillemot writes. &quot;Since then, we have engaged in a company-wide effort to listen, learn and build a roadmap for a better Ubisoft for all.

                    <span>Square Enix is reportedly collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off for PS5 and PC titled Final Fantasy Origins.
Word on the project initially began circulating over the weekend on Reddit and Resetera, and well-connected journalist and former Kinda Funny co-host Imran Khan has now lent further credence to the rumours, citing sources able to corroborate the news in a story on Fanbyte.
Final Fantasy Origins is said to take place &quot;somewhere in or adjacent to the world of the first Final Fantasy game on the NES&quot; and will slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja&#x27;s own Nioh games and From Software&#x27;s Souls series - albeit with a more accessible focus to appeal to a wider audience, according to Khan&#x27;s sources.

                    <span>343 is finally updating Halo: Combat Evolved in The Master Chief Collection to match the original Xbox version&#x27;s visuals.
The latest Insider Flight update for Halo: The Master Chief Collection came out last week, and with it an email to those in the programme detailing the under-the-radar improvements.
343 mentioned the patch includes &quot;a series of bug fixes to improve the classic visuals in H1 to better mirror the original Xbox version&quot;. This applies to both classic campaign and multiplayer, 343 added.

Earlier this month, E3&#x27;s organiser the ESA promised a virtual experience for fans with &quot;booths&quot;, hosted events, video conferencing, profiles, avatars, online forums and leaderboards. 
How it will look and work is yet to be seen, though the ESA has said all partaking developers and publishers can still livestream announcements on YouTube and other streaming platforms as well.

                    <span>One of Street Fighter 2&#x27;s most enduring myths has finally been proven true 30 years after it began.
The myth is that Street Fighter 2: World Warrior, which launched in 1991, contains a 10-0 matchup between Zangief and E. Honda.
The 10-0 matchup phrase is used by some within the fighting game community to describe a fight between two specific characters where one is so dominant that it always wins in a best of 10 match - no matter what the opponent with the weaker character tries to do.

                    <span>A Call of Duty: Warzone developer has suggested they will tone down the sun lens flare in Verdansk &#x27;84 - the game&#x27;s main map.
Some players have complained about the sun glare being so intense in Verdansk &#x27;84 that it causes visibility issues. It&#x27;s particularly problematic when looking outside of a building from the inside, in certain sections of the map.
Responding to an article on Dexerto, Raven Software&#x27;s lead VFX artist Reed Shingledecker tweeted to say: &quot;I can easily tone it down if needed.&quot;

                    <span>This month, the New York state attorney general issued a report on a scheme by “U.S. Companies and Partisans [to] Hack Democracy.” This wasn’t another attempt by Republicans to make it harder for Black people and urban residents to vote. It was a concerted attack on another core element of US democracy ­– the ability of citizens to express their voice to their political representatives. And it was carried out by generating millions of fake comments and fake emails purporting to come from real citizens.
This attack was detected because it was relatively crude. But artificial intelligence technologies are making it possible to generate genuine-seeming comments at scale, drowning out the voices of real citizens in a tidal wave of fake ones...</span>

&quot;I get that you gotta make the game profitable, but there&#x27;s gotta be a way to prevent the player from feeling cheated when they buy something,&quot; pointed out Redditor x5hadau.

                    <span>A French retailer has seemingly leaked an &quot;EU version&quot; of Sonic Collection for PlayStation 4.
It&#x27;s the same company that may have outed that Sonic Colors remaster a few weeks back, too.
French site Sogamely boasts no cover art or release date, and right now only lists the game as coming to PS4 &quot;soon&quot;. While that can only put this firmly in the take-with-a-giant-bucket-of-salt category, we do know that Sega is currently busy celebrating 30 years of Sonic, so a game collection is certainly a possibility (thanks, VGC). We&#x27;ve reached out to Sega for comment, though, and will update as/when we hear back.

The new content, Odyssey, released on 19th May, is allegedly causing all kinds of problems, with reports of crashes, poor performance, bugged missions, and poor optimisation according to recent reviews left on the game&#x27;s Steam page.
The feedback now aggregates over 3000 reviews, 2.2K of which are deemed &quot;mostly negative&quot;, despite a second hotfix that rolled out on Friday in a bid to address the game&#x27;s stability (thanks, NME).

The new tags - which were drawn up in consultation with &quot;independent, third-party organisations&quot; and &quot;other experts focused on the progress of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, LGBTQIA+, disabled, and marginalized communities&quot; - are &quot;related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, mental health, and more&quot;.

The official Crysis Twitter account dropped the tease earlier this week with two tweets. The first states &quot;They used to call me Prophet&quot; - which refers to Crysis 2 character Major Laurence &quot;Prophet&quot; Barnesa - and then a follow-up tweet gives away nowt but the wide-eyes emoji.
The following day, it shared a screenshot from Crysis 2 and yet another eyes emoji.

As its name implies, the focus of Second Chances is on successfully integrating inmates back in to society once their sentence is complete - which can be achieved by taking advantage of various new rehabilitation tools and programmes, each with…</span>

Now, though, the developer says it&#x27;s ready to turn its attention back to creating new content, and has announced a new premium expansion, Make it Count, and a new free update, known as The Precinct, for all players.

                    <span>A Red Dead Redemption 2 VR mod has launched in early access form.
It&#x27;s the work of developer Luke Ross, who has form when it comes to VR mods. He built the eye-catching VR mod for Grand Theft Auto 5 our Ian Higton enjoyed last year.
The video below from UploadVR gives us a good idea of how it works in combination with a gamepad. It&#x27;s early days, but it&#x27;s cool to see Rockstar&#x27;s epic in VR. The cutscenes work in VR, too.

Anyone on PlayStation, Steam, Xbox and even Stadia can take part. Play three Strikes in the playlist and you&#x27;ll get a special emblem for your trouble.

The developer released a video, below, detailing changes coming to PvP in the upcoming shooter.
Chief among them is the switch from 6v6 to 5v5. In the standard PvP game modes of Overwatch 2, each team contains one tank, two damage and two support characters. This makes for a significant shift, Blizzard said, in terms of map design and the dynamics between roles.

                    <span>UPDATE 20/5/21: Bandai Namco has now officially confirmed Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom for Nintendo Switch, and given it a release date of 17th September.
As detailed in the earlier ratings board leak, below, this will be the Prince&#x27;s Edition version of the game with both of its major DLCs included: The Lair of the Lost Lord and The Tale of a Timeless Tome. You&#x27;ll also get a collection of items, including a &quot;Proper Tidy&quot; ring themed around the game&#x27;s fairy helper.
Here&#x27;s a look at all that in action:

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a while since we checked in on Valheim&#x27;s sales figures: the game exploded out of nowhere in February, managing to shift a staggering 4m copies in only three weeks and reaching the 5m milestone in March. Well, we now have an update, as publisher Embracer Group has released its full year financial report. And yep, it looks like Valheim really helped boost those numbers. 
According to the report, Valheim has now sold over 6.8m copies. Embracer Group doesn&#x27;t think the success will stop there, however,…</span>

                    <span>DC has announced an Injustice animated movie.
Confirmation comes as part of a list of bonus features for the upcoming animated movie Batman: The Long Halloween, Part Two. The bonus in question is &quot;a sneak peek at the next DC animated movie - an advanced look at Injustice&quot;.
That&#x27;s all we know for now. Injustice is of course a series of DC-flavoured fighting games from Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm. Injustice: Gods Among Us came out in 2013, before a sequel, Injustice 2, came out in May 2017.

This Free Radical Design will be a new developer owned by publisher Deep Silver, with several key figures from the original developer.
In a statement published on Twitter this morning, Deep Silver said the company would be &quot;headed up&quot; by TimeSplitters co-creators Steve Ellis and David Doak, who were part of the core team from the original Free Radical Design&#x27;s heyday.

It&#x27;s a change the Warzone community has called on Raven to make for some time. This field upgrade lets you reload your gun with stopping power rounds that deal extra damage. In a game already lethal enough, Stopping Power was used to laser enemies to death in the blink of an eye.

Supermassive says it&#x27;ll be revealing more on this latest instalment next week, but first, there&#x27;s a new teaser trailer.
House of Ashes, as befits the Dark Pictures anthology format, offers up a new standalone story with its own particular take on fear. Gone is the nautical horror of the series&#x27; first outing, Man of Medan, and the time-hopping witch-y ter…</span>

Mark your calendars for the usual flurry of world premieres, as well as a musical performance by Weezer.
While absolutely not part of the official E3 (which will exist digitally this year via a web portal/app) Summer Game Fest will take place at roughly the same time.

                    <span>The launch of Cyberpunk 2077 back in December 2020 was, by most accounts, a bit of a car crash. The game&#x27;s poor performance on base consoles led to the game being pulled from the PlayStation Store, and was followed by a significant slump in CD Projekt&#x27;s stock price. 
This led to a bunch of angry investors, many of whom filed class action lawsuits against CD Projekt for allegedly misleading them over the state of the game. So many, in fact, that several lawsuits have now been rolled into one big lawsuit by a…</span>

Once you&#x27;ve downloaded Black Ops Cold War&#x27;s latest update, which prepares the game for the mid-season three refresh, you can see McClane as a &quot;coming soon&quot; operator.
I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting! Call of Duty&#x27;s McClane looks a lot like McClane from the first Die Hard film, which is what you want, really.

But while Nintendo noted it had passed the 100 game milestone, Nintendo fans are less impressed with the games on offer. 
May&#x27;s list of additions includes SNES games Caveman Ninja (also known as Joe &amp; Mac), Magical Drop 2, Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 and Spanky&#x27;s Quest, plus Ninja JaJaMaru-kun for NES. Here&#x27;s a look at all of those in action:

                    <span>Treyarch has added sniper flinch to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War as part of the game&#x27;s latest big update.
Black Ops Cold War Multiplayer fans have called for some form of sniper flinch ever since the game came out last year.
Flinch is the disruption caused to your aim when you&#x27;re hit by enemy fire. Sniper rifles are seen by some as overpowered in Black Ops Cold War because of their distinct lack of flinch.

The video, below, reveals how Rambo looks in Activision&#x27;s mega-shooter. We see the &#x27;80s action hero leap out of a chopper at the start of a Warzone game, parachute into the action, and use his iconic bow and arrow. There&#x27;s a lot of shouting while firing guns, as you&#x27;d expect.

                    <span>Saints Row: The Third Remastered is getting some improvements on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series next week, with a free upgrade that will bring these console versions to the same standard as the &quot;PC edition at high settings&quot;. 
Arriving on 25th May, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S upgrade will allow the game&#x27;s engine to &quot;run at a much higher performance, bringing improvements to lighting, texture resolution, and other visual effects thanks to the powerful hardware.&quot; The press release from Deep Silver exp…</span>

                    <span>Divinity: Original Sin 2 has been released on iPad and iPad Pro.
This is apparently a proper, full fat port. There are no surprise new microtransactions or anything like that. It&#x27;s the full game, Gift Bag DLCs included, as you remember it on PC or consoles. And it costs £23.99 (check regional pricing).
It&#x27;s been developed over two years by Larian and Russian partner Elveris. DOS2 iPad has touch controls, obviously, but also supports mouse and keyboard as well as game pads, such as the PS5 pad.

Let&#x27;s start with GTA Online. Rockstar was light on detail in its blog post:
&quot;In Los Santos, car culture is back on the streets in a big way, with new opportunities for fans of performance and customisation upgrades to get together with like-minded gearheads to test and show off their rides free from interference from authorities and other troublemakers.

                    <span>Slime Rancher on PC plus SnowRunner for console, cloud and PC headline the next two weeks of Xbox Game Pass additions. 
SnowRunner arrives for all Xbox Game Pass platforms today - coincidentally the day it confirmed a £20.99 Year 2 Pass for even more post-launch content.
PopCap puzzler Peggle 2 and third-person shooter Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighborville meanwhile both arrive on Thursday, 20th May for cloud devices via EA Play.

Currently, the game is playable on current-gen consoles via backwards compatibility.
The standalone version of GTA Online will be available to players on both platforms.

Kiyan Prince was a 15-year-old playing for Queens Park Rangers when his life was tragically cut short in 2006 when he was stabbed while trying to break up a fight in school.
Now, 15 years later, EA has added Prince to the QPR squad in FIFA 21. He appears in the game as a 30-year-old.

                    <span>Chinese augmented reality headset company Nreal is being sued by Epic Games, developer of Fortnite and Unreal Engine.
If you hadn&#x27;t guessed already, the squabble is over the name Nreal, which Epic Games argues is deliberately similar to its own Unreal (thanks, The Verge). 
The two companies have been warring over the name for years, though this latest legal challenge from Epic appears to have been sparked by an Nreal boast it had &quot;big news&quot; - seemingly, that its Nreal smartglasses were being prepped for US …</span>

                    <span>Nintendo has shown off an extended look at several new modes coming to Mario Golf: Super Rush, as well as the game&#x27;s full character roster. 
Speed Golf is a fresh mode where players race each other on foot across the golf course in-between taking shots. (If only karts existed in Mario&#x27;s world!)
While dashing, players can use items to regain stamina and special attacks to thwack the ball/other players out of the way. (Seriously, why isn&#x27;t Mario Golf Kart a thing?)

Birmingham Mail reported that the spending has come at a time its local authority is being asked to cut £29m from its budget - and these plant pots don&#x27;t look Cheep Cheep.

The average user review rating is &quot;Very Positive&quot;, though there are a number of complaints over the game&#x27;s lack of an FOV slider outside of photo mode, and its insistence on launching Origin to launch the Legendary Edition launcher, to then launch a specific game.

When this problem is discussed, people regularly quote the statistic that 85% of US critical infrastructure is in private hands. It’s a handy number, and matches our intuition. Still, I have never been able to find a factual basis, or anyone who knows where the number comes from. Paul…</span>
