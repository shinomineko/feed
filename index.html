                              <span>Microsoft has partnered with Crocs to introduce a new line of Minecraft-inspired Crocs.

The limited-edition collection – set to launch on 16th February – will be available worldwide and includes two classic clogs, two classic elevated clogs that come with Jibbitz charms, a classic slide, and two &quot;unique sets of Minecraft-themed Jibbitz charms that will &quot;turn any pair of Crocs into a Minecraft adventure&quot;.

Both sets of clogs will be available for adults and kids, although the classic slide will only be available for grown-ups - sorry.

The documentary - which is available to stream right now, for free, on Youtube – follows the studio&#x27;s trials and tribulations as it develops Psychonauts 2, confronting &quot;overly ambitious designs, poor morale, technical challenges, and financial woes&quot;.

Across 32 episodes – and a staggering 20+ hours – the documentary continues the work of previous documentary series Double Fine Adventure, offering an &quot;even deeper insight into the passion, humour, and heartbreak of video game development&quot;.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has revealed that he would &quot;absolutely remain&quot; at the megacorp if the planned acquisition with Microsoft does not proceed.

Originally, it was thought that Kotick would stand down once the deal is finalised, but Fox Business reports that undisclosed sources &quot;close to the situation&quot; say that if Microsoft&#x27;s planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard stalls, current CEO Kotick &quot;will absolutely remain at the gaming giant to run the company&quot;.

The same sources reports that the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is &quot;the only regulatory body that really matters&quot; given &quot;it offers companies no legal recourse such as a trial&quot;, but &quot;confidence remains high&quot; that the merger will proceed as planned.

                              <span>Make-A-Wish will run a second The World Streams For the Wishes (FTW) global livestream fundraiser later this year.

Streamers are invited to support critically-ill children by livestreaming on any platform, in any language, and at any time throughout April in order to grant wishes to children living with critical illnesses in over 50 countries around the world. Last year&#x27;s inaugural event raised over £103,000 ($125K).

The event has been sponsored by Bandai Namco Europe and the publisher&#x27;s park management game, Park Beyond, along with SecretLab and Nanoleaf.

                              <span>It looks like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be the largest first-party Nintendo game ever to come to Switch.

That&#x27;s according to Redditor bob4978135, who was one of the first to clock that the Japanese version of the game weighs in at 18.2GB.

The US Nintendo eShop makes a similar size claim, whilst the UK Nintendo eShop says you&#x27;ll need a whopping 18.6GB free to download the highly-anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>Hi-Fi Rush is unquestionably fab, but developer Tango Gameworks&#x27; rhythm-action treat might just be a little bit fabber than we all initially thought if a newly made discovery turns out to be the cheeky tease for a new The Evil Within game some are interpreting it to be.


As noted by GamesRadar,  Hi-Fi Rush features one particular cinematic - situated just before Track 11: The Needle Drop - in which a news ticker can be spotted on a screen as protagonist Chai and his crew ride an elevator up to the game&#x27;s final boss.


It&#x27;s a brief, blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it moment, but as the camera cuts to a close-up of the screen, the words &quot;Sequel to popular survival horror franchise announced&quot; scroll into view.

                              <span>Nearly two years after its initial delay, Minecraft&#x27;s long-awaited archeology feature is finally on the horizon, with developer Mojang now confirming it&#x27;ll be arriving as part of the game&#x27;s 1.20 update later this year.


Archeology was originally announced during 2020&#x27;s Minecraft Live, and was planned to release as part of the game&#x27;s expansive Caves &amp; Cliffs update the following summer. However, as its launch date neared, Mojang - as it grappled with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic - announced it had made the decision to split Caves &amp; Cliffs&#x27; feature list into two, with a second release due before the end of the year. Archeology, though, had been decoupled from even that and would arrive at an unspecified future point.


Skip ahead almost two years and we&#x27;re back to today, and the announcement that archeology will finally debut with Minecraft&#x27;s next major update.

So there.

                              <span>It only feels like yesterday we were all praying to the gods of impossible things that we might one day get a sequel to cult monologue-&#x27;em-up Alan Wake, but now, not only has one been announced, developer Remedy Entertainment has confirmed the game&#x27;s reached a stage in development where it&#x27;s &quot;playable from start to finish&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to Remedy CEO Tero Virtala, who shared the news as part of the company&#x27;s latest financial results report. &quot;Alan Wake 2 is in full production,&quot; he wrote in his statement to investors. &quot;The game will soon have all content in place, and it is playable from start to finish.&quot;


That probably shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a surprise, of course, given the studio had previously confirmed a 2023 release for its long-awaited sequel, but it&#x27;s a milestone worth noting for Alan Wake fans, and Virtala adds Remedy will next &quot;move onto polishing the experience.&quot;

                              <span>Earlier today, Sega released a short video introducing a new game it&#x27;s developing in collaboration with Yoko Taro.

Yoko is best known as the creator of the Drakengard and Nier series, and it looks like he&#x27;ll be bringing some of his RPG expertise and trademark, er, style to the game.

The game&#x27;s full title is 404 Game Re:set -Error Game Reset- and is an RPG for mobiles.

                              <span>Valve has set tongues wagging in the Team Fortress 2 community by announcing what sounds like a meaningful update due out this summer.


In a post on the previously dormant Team Fortress website, Valve promised a &quot;full-on update-sized update&quot;, while calling for content from Steam Workshop creators.

&quot;The last few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates,&quot; Valve said. &quot;But this year, we&#x27;re planning on shipping a full-on update-sized update - with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints and who knows what else?! Which means we need Steam Workshop content! YOUR Steam Workshop content!&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has ruled out a Switch price cut for now despite flagging sales of the console.


In an official Q&amp;A summary posted in English, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa addressed a question about the company&#x27;s pricing strategy for the Switch, which has so far resisted a price cut since its launch in March 2017.

&quot;As we continue the Nintendo Switch business over the long term, we have tried to preserve the value and prices of both hardware and software as much as possible,&quot; reads Furukawa&#x27;s response. &quot;We do not believe that policy needs to be changed at this point.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft is having some serious issues with The Division 2 at the moment.


Last week, Ubisoft announced it had delayed the planned 7th February launch of Season 11: Reign of Fire due to a localisation issue.


Then, in a tweet published yesterday, Ubisoft admitted that in creating a fix for this problem, it caused an error that brought down the game&#x27;s build generation. This means the development team cannot update the game at all until the system is rebuilt.

                              <span>Sony has accused Microsoft of &quot;obvious harassment&quot; as the battle for Activision Blizzard heated up this week.


As reported by Axios Axios, Microsoft wanted to see files on Sony executives, including performance reviews, as part of the &quot;discovery&quot; phase of this particularly bitter legal battle with the US&#x27; Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.


In a motion filed to the court, Sony issued strong words in response: &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s demand for performance reviews for SIE&#x27;s leadership is obvious harassment.&quot;

                              <span>Volker Wertich, the designer of the original The Settlers, has unveiled new city builder Pioneers of Pagonia, which is coming to PC early access toward the end of this year.


Pioneers of Pagonia sets players loose on the titular islands of Pagonia, where their goal is to establish their presence through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover - and the alliances they forge with Pagonia&#x27;s not always friendly inhabitants - along the way.


&quot;With Pioneers of Pagonia,&quot; Wertich explained in a statement accompanying today&#x27;s announcement, &quot;we&#x27;re returning to the origins of city-building simulations, with thousands of inhabitants scurrying around and a focus on the in-depth simulation of the game world and economy that the community loves so much.&quot;

                              <span>As it likes to do on occassion, Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Blog has had a bit of a mini showcase, highlighting a number of promising indie games bound for its consoles in the future. This time around, PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, Eternights, Animal Well, and Pacific Drive got the highlight treatment and you can see what they&#x27;re offering below.


First up is PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, a wider release of developer Q-Games&#x27; previously Apple-Arcade-exclusive side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up. It sees up to four player taking to the streets of Junktown and using their robo-abilities to eliminate anyone that gets in their way. It promises 25 stages across five distinct areas, over 100 customisable truck parts, online and local co-op, competitive mini-games, and more when it launches for PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC later this year.


Next up is Animal Well, the first game from YouTuber videogamedunkey&#x27;s publishing company Bigmode. It&#x27;s a Metroidvania from solo developer Shared Memory and sees players exploring a surreal labyrinthine filled with animals and secrets. Shared Memory discusses their goals for the game on the PlayStation Blog, explaining how they&#x27;re creating a core experience that&#x27;s accessible for all, but with deeper layers of mystery for those that like to probe and explore. There&#x27;s no release date for Animal Well yet but it&#x27;s coming to PS5 and PC.

                              <span>As revealed during last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct - an announcement you might reasonably have missed if you don&#x27;t give two hoots about Nintendo - Dead Cells&#x27; Return to Castlevania DLC finally has a release date and is coming to PC and consoles on 6th March.


Return to Castlevania, if you&#x27;ve missed previous word on the deliciously fitting crossover, is a new paid expansion that developer Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire have described as &quot;our very own love letter to the granddad of Dead Cells&quot;.


It adds two new Castlevania-inspired biomes to the superb rogue-like action-platformer, taking players - who&#x27;ll get some assistance from the likes of Richter Belmont and Alucardon - on a tour of the spooky outskirts and candle-lit interior of Dracula&#x27;s Castle.

                              <span>Fans of Paradox Interactive grand strategy title Europa Universalis 4 have questioned the timing of a developer diary detailing new additions on the way for Russia, highlighting its imperial expansion into eastern Europe. 


While part of a series of updates adding to the game&#x27;s various empires, the game&#x27;s latest developer update, published this week, describes the changes to Russia in detail. Its timing raised eyebrows, coming two weeks before the anniversary of Russia&#x27;s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and amid reports suggesting the country is currently preparing a new offensive.


&quot;It&#x27;s a historical game,&quot; a fan told Eurogamer, &quot;but the fantasy missions they plan on releasing are more in line [with] the Soviet dream of conquering all Slavic nations... I find it completely distasteful they&#x27;re working on this at such a time.&quot;

                              <span>The tax code isn’t software. It doesn’t run on a computer. But it’s still code. It’s a series of algorithms that takes an input—financial information for the year—and produces an output: the amount of tax owed. It’s incredibly complex code; there are a bazillion details and exceptions and special cases. It consists of government laws, rulings from the tax authorities, judicial decisions, and legal opinions.
Like computer code, the tax code has bugs. They might be mistakes in how the tax laws were written. They might be mistakes in how the tax code is interpreted, oversights in how parts of the law were conceived, or unintended omissions of some sort or another. They might arise from the exponentially huge number of ways different parts of the tax code interact...</span>

                              <span>Comedy management game Two Point Campus will be available on Steam for free ahead of Valentine&#x27;s Day.


That&#x27;s beginning right now until 13th February, along with a host of new love items available permanently and even love bombs.


Yes, if your campus is suitably decorated, Cupid will visit and - if impressed - will drop some Love Bombs on students to whip them up into a romantic frenzy. I presume they&#x27;ll be heading straight to the nearest love trumpet.

                              <span>There&#x27;s one game which we missed in our roundup of everything shown in last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct.

That&#x27;s because, for some reason, it was only shown in the Japanese version of the stream, despite being a worldwide release.
The game had a short 40-second teaser in the Direct, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Hello and welcome to the Eurogamer Newscast, which this week looks ahead to everything on the horizon for Nintendo Switch - and Nintendo itself.

Of course, we recap last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and discuss what we thought about Pikmin getting a dog and whether Zelda really will be playable in Tears of the Kingdom. But with the knowledge that Nintendo itself admits Switch is now firmly on the decline, the company skipping E3 this year and rumours of new hardware in 2024, we also discuss where Switch is now headed.
For fans of Nintendo, there&#x27;s plenty still to enjoy - even if it is now slanted to nostalgia, such as with Game Boy games, Metroid ports and a Baten Kaitos remake. But where does this leave Nintendo later this year, and next? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Retro JRPG Sea of Stars finally has a release date of 29th August, across Switch, PC, and PlayStation.


The news was shared at last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct livestream, along with the immediate release of a demo - our first chance to go hands-on with the game.


Sea of Stars is from Sabotage Studio, who rose to prominence with the release of 2D side scroller The Messenger. Where that game was inspired by the Ninja Gaiden series, Sea of Stars is inspired by Chrono Trigger and other SNES JRPGs.

And wow. We got small teases of the story plus a look at new enemies and powers. Plus, confirmation of the game&#x27;s retail price  and a snazzy collector&#x27;s edition.


Theories abound right now about what it all means, so let&#x27;s dive in and analyse the trailer to see what we can figure out!

                              <span>Metroid Prime Remastered was surprise released at last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, but there&#x27;s already a touch of controversy about... the doors.


The doors in the Metroid series have always been iconic, locked behind Samus&#x27;s various beam weapons, and Metroid Prime is no exception. It was the first time we got to see them from the front, so it was important to get the design right.


But in this remastered release, the design has been altered. And Zoid Kirsch, one of the original game&#x27;s developers, isn&#x27;t happy about it.

                              <span>Netflix has announced plans to begin charging you extra if you regularly share your account with users outside of your home.


Users outside your &quot;primary location&quot; will require an &quot;extra member sub account&quot;, starting now in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain, and elsewhere in the world &quot;more broadly in the coming months&quot;. 


Sub accounts will cost less than a standard subscription - though more than it currently costs to share your password with family and friends. In addition, the pricing seems to vary from country to country, at €4/month in Portugal but €6/month in Spain.

                              <span>Harmony: The Fall of Reverie was a surprise inclusion in last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct from French developer Don&#x27;t Nod - the studio behind the original Life is Strange games, Remember Me and Tell Me Why. 


Due for launch in June for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, the title is notable for its colourful 2D visuals - something of a departure for Don&#x27;t Nod.


For fans of Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s choice-based storytelling, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie seems to offer something more familiar. Actions you take will open up new branching story paths, as the main character Polly engages in clairvoyance and interacts with a set of god-like spirits aligned with &quot;Aspirations of Humanity&quot; such as Glory, Power, Chaos and Bliss.

                              <span>Activision finally confirmed what Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 6v6 multiplayer fans can look forward to from Season 2.


The company said two &quot;new&quot; maps are set to hit the shooter as part of its second season: Dome and Valderas Museum.


However, fans have taken issue with Activision calling these maps new. Dome is a remake of a map that has featured in multiple Call of Duty games in the past, including 2021&#x27;s Vanguard. It made its debut in Call of Duty: World at War. Specifically, the version set to hit this Modern Warfare 2 is from Infinity Ward&#x27;s 2011 game Modern Warfare 3.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s hotly-anticipated February 2023 showcase is over, and we now have a much clearer idea of what&#x27;s coming to Switch during the first half of this year. Nintendo Direct crammed a huge amount into its 40-minute runtime, including some truly fantastic reveals. We got a portion of Zelda, a pinch of Pikmin 4, a bowlful of Bayonetta and more than a few surprises. Here are all the announcements, trailers and news Nintendo gave the gaming world. Strap yourself in, there&#x27;s A LOT.


Nintendo Direct kicked off with a trailer for Pikmin 4, which looks as lovely and cute as you&#x27;d hope. The big news is the release date: 21st July 2023!


Next up, a trailer for Volume 3 of the Xenoblade Chronices 3 expansion pass, which is out later this month, and a sneak peek of the new story scenario coming in Volume 4 later this year.

                              <span>Not content with giving Mario Kart 8 Deluxe players a heaving bunch of new tracks as part of its Booster Course Pass, Nintendo has announced it&#x27;ll be bringing the best video game character of all time, Birdo, back in the DLC&#x27;s upcoming Wave 4 as a playable racer.


Birdo, who&#x27;s actually quite modest in real-life and is generally content to just let that stupid plumber in the hat steal the limelight, changed the face of gaming when they were introduced in 1988&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. 2. 


Since then, Birdo has been personally responsible for developing all of Nintendo&#x27;s best games and finally found time to make their Mario Kart debut in 2003&#x27;s Double Dash!!. Birdo has been a Mario Kart staple ever since, but someone carelessly forgot to include them in Mario Kart 8 - probably Miyamoto, because he was too busy drawing pictures of Birdo - but that oversight will be remedied as of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4 DLC.

Tonight&#x27;s Nintendo Direct broadcast revealed a new 21st April arrival for the Nintendo Switch tactical strategy title.


Advance Wars was originally set to launch a year ago, but was held back from launch due to the proximity of its release and the very real Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Samba de Amigo: Party Central, as this new version will be known, takes the exuberant rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - where the aim is essentially to orientate your maraca-ing arms into position according to the game&#x27;s whims then rhythmically shake to the music like you&#x27;ve never shaken before - but slings in a bunch of new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


40 songs are promised, spanning a variety of genres, as are a bunch of cosmetics to customise your simian avatars. Additionally, Love Checker mode is back, testing your compatibility with a second player based on the accuracy of your limb-flailing, and there&#x27;s online multiplayer in World Party mode, where the goal is to keep the beat and avoid being eliminated.

                              <span>Tonight brought our first look at Pikmin 4 gameplay in a trailer shown as part of Nintendo Direct. 


The footage introduced us to the brand new Ice Pikmin variety, which can freeze enemies and surfaces, such as pools of water. The original Red, Blue and Yellow Pikmin types were also shown.


Tonight&#x27;s trailer also introduced us to an odd-looking dog creature which can be used to charge or carry Pikmin across obstacles such as water. It&#x27;s not a Pikmin but... it looks friendly.

                              <span>Forspoken director Takeshi Aramaki has confirmed a patch is currently in the works to address a wide range of issues following the game&#x27;s mixed reception.


In a statement shared on Twitter, Aramaki wrote, &quot;We&#x27;ve been listening to all your feedback and are hard at work on an upcoming patch that will include improvements to overall performance, graphics, playability, and general updates and fixes to the game content across PS5 and various PC hardware configurations&quot;.


Aramaki didn&#x27;t go into specifics, but Forspoken has been criticised both from a gameplay and technical perspective since launch, with Digital Foundry having particularly stern words for the PC release, calling it a &quot;confusing, deeply disappointing port&quot; in its tech review.

The team of computer scientist George Lasry, pianist Norbert Biermann and astrophysicist Satoshi Tomokiyo—all keen cryptographers—initially thought the batch of encoded documents related to Italy, because that was how they were filed at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.
However, they quickly realised the letters were in French. Many verb and adjectival forms being feminine, regular mention of captivity, and recurring names—such as Walsingham—all put them on the trail of Mary. Sir Francis Walsingham was Queen Elizabeth’s spymaster...</span>

                              <span>A Californian Nintendo fan has sparked a major security scare at their university, following a &quot;bad joke&quot; email designed to get  their classes cancelled so they could watch the latest Nintendo Direct broadcast.


California State University Police today issued a statement on the perceived threat, after a professor was told via anonymous email to call off their class due to a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime event&quot; set to occur.


The start of 2023 has seen yet another string of mass shootings across the US, with eight incidents in January alone leaving at least four people dead. The majority of those shootings occured in California, including the mass shooting at Monterey Park that left 12 dead, which gained global media attention.

Tonight&#x27;s the big one - or at least it really should be - in which the veil will be properly lifted from the next big Zelda and we finally learn more about Tears of the Kingdom. Or maybe we&#x27;re just going to get a 40 minute deep dive into Bayonetta Origins. Who knows? 


That&#x27;s part of the excitement of a Nintendo Direct, where we&#x27;re all hoping for news on Pikmin 4, the long-awaited ports of Metroid Prime and the belated release of Advance Wars and maybe even an F-Zero reboot thrown in for good measure. How much of that happens remains to be seen, so join us from 10pm GMT as we brace for disappointment.

The Battle Royale maps for Revelry are Broken Moon, Storm Point, and World&#x27;s Edge. Sadly, there&#x27;s no sign of Kings Canyon popping its head up in this mode any time soon. 
However, with new content comes sacrifice and the 3 vs 3 Arenas mode will be leaving the game as soon as the new season begins. There&#x27;s still some time left to get in a few quick battles before the launch date next week, so Arenas fans still have some time to say their farewells.

                              <span>Pokémon Go is currently gearing up for its third annual Tour event: a weekend-long spotlight on a particular region of the Pokémon world and all the species originally found within it. 


This year, after the turns of Johto and Kanto in 2021 and 2022, it&#x27;s time for Hoenn: the setting of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and the home of Mudkip, Metagross and many other favourites. 


The big difference this time around is that developer Niantic has dropped the need to buy a ticket for the majority of Tour&#x27;s gameplay. It means fans can take part in the weekend&#x27;s storyline, choose a focus on Ruby or Sapphire spawns, and catch Pokémon with a boosted chance of being in their sought-after Shiny versions without the need to pay up.

Before those, Madden NFL 23 joins Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, if you prefer your sports a little more padded out than simply watching the Six Nations.


SD Gundam Battle Alliance also arrives tomorrow, while Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord joins the subscription service on Valentine&#x27;s Day if you don&#x27;t have other plans. Last year, our Bertie dubbed it as &quot;stubborn and unruly unless you have time to break it in&quot;.

                              <span>The UK regulator investigating Microsoft&#x27;s attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover attempt has raised significant concerns over the deal going ahead. 


In a provisional report published today, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that Microsoft owning Activision &quot;could harm UK gamers&quot; and potentially result in &quot;higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation&quot;.


While provisional, the findings paint a gloomy picture for Microsoft - against a similar backdrop of concerns raised by the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU&#x27;s European Commission, which have both contested the deal as it currently stands.

The zombie MMO was recently delayed from March until November, as Fntastic seemingly forgot to trademark the game name. The developer insisted the game was not a scam following the delay - its development has seen multiple delays and, until this point, a lack of real gameplay shown.




After that, a ten minute gameplay trailer was released. However, users on Twitter and reddit noticed some striking similarities between Fntastic&#x27;s game and Call of Duty.

 We&#x27;re still waiting to hear the price for Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s collector&#x27;s edition, which includes an artbook, Steelbook case, poster and pin badges. 
 
 Tonight, Nintendo also revealed a new amiibo figure of Link that grants access to materials and weapons, as well as a special fabric for Link&#x27;s paraglider. Tears of the Kingdom? Tears of my wallet, more like.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick has taken aim at post-Brexit Britain, as it looks increasingly likely the UK&#x27;s anti-competition regulator will try and block Microsoft&#x27;s ambitious $68.7bn buyout of the company. 


The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is due to weigh in imminently on the proposed deal, which has already seen objections from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and regulators in the EU.


Activision&#x27;s controversial CEO was asked by CNBC how he would react if the UK joined other regulators in opposing the deal - and Kotick did not hold back.

Resident Evil: Death Island will be a continuation of the animated saga, which has mostly followed the career of Leon Kennedy, and is distributed by Sony Pictures.


Judging by the brand new teaser trailer, there&#x27;s a zombie outbreak (shock!) on the island of Alcatraz that only Leon and Chris Redfield can deal with - check it out below.

Cities: Skylines Remastered, as the new version is known, promises a broad range of improvements over the existing console release, starting with increased graphical performance - which is as specific as publisher Paradox Interactive is being on that front right now.


Other improvements include the ability for players to build bigger cities thanks to a bump in the buildable tile limit, which rises from 9 in the current console release to 25.

                              <span>With two gothic platformers under its belt in Bloodstained: Curse Of The Moon and its sequel, you might think developer Inti Creates would have had its fill of moonlit spires, opulent interiors, and the like, but no! The studio has now unveiled Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, coming to Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 23rd February.


Grim Guardians: Demon Purge - described by Inti as a &quot;2D side-scrolling action game&quot; - certainly has the whiff of a Castlevania about it, ticking all the right aesthetic boxes as its demon-hunting sister protagonists brave a sprawling castle in an attempt to save their school.


Progress unfolds across distinct stages, with each sister having access to unique skills that players can utilise by switching between them. There are also bosses that reward new weapons on defeat - opening up new routes in later areas - plus two-player co-op for those that want to play with a friend. Additionally, Inti promises extensive difficulty options with the game&#x27;s Style System, and unique changes on repeat plays.

                              <span>Velan Studios, the developer behind Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit and the sadly soon-to-go-offline Knockout City, has unveiled Hot Wheels: Rift Rally, a new mixed reality racer that&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, PS4, and iOS on 14th March.


Like Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit before it, Hot Wheels: Rift Rally includes a bunch of physical components - in this case, a remote control car known as the Chameleon RC and four &quot;mixed reality gates&quot; used to lay out courses in the real-world - all of which are transformed into something a little more exotic when viewed on a screen.


The Chameleon RC, for instance, can take on the appearance of over 140 different vehicles, ranging from classic Hot Wheels cars (think Twin Mill, Bone Shaker, Gotta Go, and Mach Speeder) to a number of Rift Rally originals.

                              <span>Darkest Dungeon 2 - developer Red Hook Studios&#x27; deliciously bleak rogue-like RPG sequel - leaves early access on 8th May, arriving on Steam the same day.


Darkest Dungeon 2 launched into early access back in October 2021, but sidestepped a Steam release in favour of Epic Games Store exclusivity throughout its journey toward version 1.0. As Red Hook previously explained though, that exclusivity ends with Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s full release, meaning it&#x27;ll soon be creeping onto Valve&#x27;s platform.


And if you haven&#x27;t been following Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s last year and a half of development, you may be wondering what changes this sequel brings. Chief of these (other than its shift to full 3D) is a new structure described by Red Hook as a &quot;grim turn-based roadtrip&quot; across five regions.

                              <span>Microsoft has unveiled the Stellar Shift, the latest variant in its now three-strong series of metallic-hued Xbox wireless controllers - this one sporting a purple-blue frontage said to evoke &quot;a mesmerising feeling of deep space vibes&quot;.


Stellar Shift follows on from Microsoft&#x27;s Lunar Shift and Aqua Shift controllers (the latter being metallic blue with hints of purple, so definitely not the same thing), and features the same rubberised &quot;swirl&quot; grip and textured bumpers seen in previous editions of the device.


And, of course, it features the usual array of orifices (there&#x27;s a 3.5mm headset jack) and inputs seen across Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox controller range. Thumbsticks, D-pad, and face buttons, in case you&#x27;re wondering, all come in grey with purple label detail.

                              <span>In early 2021, IEEE Security and Privacy asked a number of board members for brief perspectives on the SolarWinds incident while it was still breaking news. This was my response.
The penetration of government and corporate networks worldwide is the result of inadequate cyberdefenses across the board. The lessons are many, but I want to focus on one important one we’ve learned: the software that’s managing our critical networks isn’t secure, and that’s because the market doesn’t reward that security.
SolarWinds is a perfect example. The company was the initial infection vector for much of the operation. Its trusted position inside so many critical networks made it a perfect target for a supply-chain attack, and its shoddy security practices made it an easy target...</span>

All third-party tools are against the Terms of Service for the MMORPG - in fact, just last week director and producer Naoki Yoshida stated he was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; in the use of mods.



GShade, however, is a popular mod to alter the aesthetics of the game without affecting gameplay.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two is planning to settle its legal case with a group of talented fans who had reverse-engineered GTA3 and Vice City. 


Take-Two went after the fan projects in 2021, claiming copyright infringement. Twice, the publisher forced the projects to be removed via DMCA takedown, as the fans themselves protested that the projects were unprotected by copyright or permitted under fair use.


After a back and forth between Take-Two and the fans, lawyers got involved. Take-Two alleged the fans had distributed &quot;derivative GTA source code&quot; and had infringed copyright, and demanded GitHub remove the projects once and for all.

A new release date trailer, below, shows the game&#x27;s sombre tone and hints at the sort of alien-like creatures players can expect to fish.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has reported healthy financial results following the launches of both Overwatch 2 and last year&#x27;s Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.


Blizzard&#x27;s monthly active users have seen a sharp uptick, up nearly 87 percent year-on-year, following a long trend downwards. Revenue for the three months ending 31st December rose by roughly the same amount, as people splashed their cash on the free-to-play sequel.


World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, the latest expansion to Blizzard&#x27;s long-running MMO, launched in late November. For the first time in 10 years, sales were down slightly on its predecessor, 2020&#x27;s Shadowlands (which shifted over 3.7m copies at launch).

The Ultimate edition came to consoles in 2021 and now - finally - it&#x27;s on PC.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns was my favourite game from last year that never found an audience. Just today, it was listed among the list of titles recently released by publisher Take-Two that reviewed positively but - for whatever reason - failed to set tills ringing. 


Released in December, Midnight Suns offers a strong story-based single-player experience that alternates between easy-to-understand turn-based combat and an RPG-style hub where you hang out and befriend the superheroes you&#x27;ve recruited onto your team. The fights are fun and fast-paced. The story is well-written, and the interactions between Marvel characters frequently brilliant. There&#x27;s a lot to love.


I never felt the game&#x27;s marketing properly spelled all of that out - and as someone who has not played XCOM before, I was initially unsure about leaping into my first Firaxis game. Ultimately I took the plunge and came away very happily surprised.

From developer Ghost Story Games, the game was first shown at The Game Awards last December and looks to include many familiar features to BioShock fans. It&#x27;s set for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.



The release date news comes from Take-Two&#x27;s latest earnings report, which states the publisher will release 87 games between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2025 (ending March that year).

Speaking to investors, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said recent releases such as the excellent but overlooked Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, plus PGA Tour 2K23 and New Tales of the Borderlands, had all been received well but sold poorly.


&quot;We&#x27;re seeing softness in the overall market,&quot; Zelnick subsequently told GamesIndustry.biz. &quot;Our titles are performing, we&#x27;ve gotten great review scores, we&#x27;ve gotten terrific critical acclaim. And one after another, we&#x27;ve been delivering hits into the current market.

As reported by Variety, 7.5 million viewers in the US tuned in for the series&#x27; fourth episode on Sunday - that is an increase of 17 percent from the previous week, where 6.4 million viewers settled down with episode three. 
The Last of Us has consistently seen its same-day audience numbers grow every week since it made its debut in January. In fact, episode four&#x27;s numbers are up 60 percent from episode one&#x27;s same-day numbers, for which 4.7 million of us tuned in to the premiere.

                              <span>Nintendo has now shifted a staggering 122m Switch consoles, enough to finally exclipse the Game Boy (118m) and PlayStation 4 (117m). 


Six years on from launch, this total places Switch as the third-best selling game platform of all time, behind Nintendo DS (154m) and PlayStation 2 (above 155m).


Can Switch still rise further? Console sales are slowing - down 21 percent year-on-year - but it still seems possible, with sales of the Switch OLED model balancing out declining sales of the vanilla Switch and portable-only Lite.

Loverwatch, as it&#x27;s called, is a thirty minute non-canon text-based dating sim that allows players to date either Mercy or Genji, assisted by Cupid (Hanzo). A secret ending rewards players with a themed POTG Highlight.


Launching on 13th February, it will be available via web client only until 28th February.

The surge is coming from numerous malware families, including AuroraStealer, IcedID, Meta Stealer, RedLine Stealer, Vidar, Formbook, and XLoader. In the past, these families typically relied on phishing and malicious spam that attached Microsoft Word documents with booby-trapped macros. Over the past month, Google Ads has become the go-to place for criminals to spread their malicious wares that are disguised as legitimate downloads by impersonating brands such as Adobe Reader, Gimp, Microsoft Teams, OBS, Slack, Tor, and Thunderbird...</span>

                              <span>Today brings a fresh trailer for Tekken 8, and confirmation the series&#x27; silent assassin Nina Williams will once again be included.


Developer Bandai Namco&#x27;s confirmation Nina is part of Tekken 8&#x27;s roster comes as little surprise. She&#x27;s been a familiar face for the franchise since its origins, and has popped up in pretty much every major game since.


Nina joins other previously-announced Tekken 8 attendees such as  Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Paul Phoenix, Marshall Law, King, Jack-8, and Lars Alexandersson.

Next she completed FromSoftware&#x27;s epic with a dance pad. Then she did it across two games with a dance pad and controller simultaneously.



Now, she&#x27;s taking her musical Elden Ring pursuits to a whole new level by playing the game with a guitar. Is there no end to MissMikkaa&#x27;s talent?

The room seemed ripe for a secret, so I began picking up the candles one by one with Stasis, throwing them to the floor - which also blew them out. Nothing happened. 


This morning, I&#x27;ve seen others had more luck than I did at unlocking a special secret here - and that Dead Space remake developer Motive has a wonderful Easter egg hidden away for those who take the time to puzzle it out.

                              <span>New details have emerged on the Retro Studios pitch Star Fox Armada for the Wii U, which was sadly never developed.


YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming spoke with former Retro Studios artist Eric Kozlowsky, who came up with the concept for the game.


Not only would the game have had a puppet visual style reminiscent of the series&#x27; early promotional images, it would have had a major focus on online multiplayer.

                              <span>An initial character roster for Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns featured around 25 heroes, director Jake Solomon has revealed. 

Firaxis&#x27; excellent tactical role-playing game ultimately featured 12 of the biggest Avengers and Midnight Suns faces in its final version - with plans to add four more characters post-launch. 


However, trimming down that final roster to something more manageable involved discussing several famous Marvel characters and whether they were suitable.

In an interview with VG247, Kitase - who&#x27;s producer on the Remake games - was asked about changing story elements without altering the impact of the original game.



&quot;We approached the FF7 Remake project with the aim to make it something that could be enjoyed by both fans of the original game and people who did not know it,&quot; said Kitase.

In the next issue of Play Magazine (releasing tomorrow, 7th February), the game&#x27;s director Stig Asmussen has given further details on traversal in the game (thanks Games Radar).


It will include both a fast travel system and rideable creatures, to ensure players can explore to the full.

                              <span>Unlike previous episodes in the series, episode four (known as &quot;Please Hold To My Hand&quot;) of The Last of Us could be cosidered part one of, I assume, two. Last week&#x27;s episode was largely its own, self contained, installment. Meanwhile, episode one and two both had a very clearly defined break in the narrative at their close. 


A lot of episode four, however, feels like it is setting us up for episode five. It is laying down the groundwork for what is next, and asks more questions than it answers. 


But even though this may be the case, there is still plenty to discuss. Let&#x27;s dive on in.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly ready to fight what it expects to be opposition from the UK&#x27;s competition regulator.

According to the New York Times (£) (thanks, VGC), the megacorp believes &quot;the antitrust authority in Britain to oppose the transaction&quot;. It follows a similar intervention from the EU, which objected to a perceived risk in Microsoft owning Call of Duty given it could reduce competition in the video games industry.

According to four people &quot;briefed on the matter who were not authorised to speak publicly&quot;, Microsoft hopes &quot;to convince both Britain and the European Union to accept its concessions and approve the deal, which could make it easier for the company to reach an agreement with the FTC before the scheduled administrative trial starts in the summer&quot;.

                              <span>After &quot;one last&quot; delay for Sons of the Forest late last year, developer Endnight Games has announced the horror will release in Early Access at the end of this month rather than be delayed again.

Endnight says it&#x27;s made the decision to release in early access in order to &quot;involve the community in the continued development of this project&quot; - which it says led to the &quot;massive success&quot; of predecessor The Forest - whilst also &quot;keep[ing its] 23rd February release date&quot;.

&quot;It’s been a long journey since we first started Sons of The Forest development, and it’s grown into the biggest, most complex game we have ever made,&quot; the team said in a statement posted on Steam.

The update will introduce new continent, Rowen, &quot;where players will encounter two competing factions: Preigelli and Liebertane, who are competing for Sylmael, crimson jewels that are a precious resource in Arkesia&quot;. 

Complete the Rowen world quests, and you&#x27;ll be able to choose a faction for open-world PvP, but Amazon Games teases that &quot;the battle is just beginning&quot;, and the competition &quot;will heat up further in March, when the Tulubik Battlefield releases&quot;.

                              <span>The field of machine learning (ML) security—and corresponding adversarial ML—is rapidly advancing as researchers develop sophisticated techniques to perturb, disrupt, or steal the ML model or data. It’s a heady time; because we know so little about the security of these systems, there are many opportunities for new researchers to publish in this field. In many ways, this circumstance reminds me of the cryptanalysis field in the 1990. And there is a lesson in that similarity: the complex mathematical attacks make for good academic papers, but we mustn’t lose sight of the fact that insecure software will be the likely attack vector for most ML systems...</span>

The Kubernetes project runs a community-owned image registry called registry.k8s.io to host its container images. On the 3rd of April 2023, the old registry k8s.gcr.io will be frozen and no further images for Kubernetes and related subprojects will be pushed to the old registry.
This registry registry.k8s.io replaced the old one and has been generally available for several months. We have published a blog post about its benefits to the community and the Kubernetes project. This post also announced that future versions of Kubernetes will not be available in the old registry. Now that time has come.
What does this change mean for contributors:

                              <span>A second Wo Long Fallen Dynasty demo will be available from 24th February.

The bite-sized snippet of Team Ninja&#x27;s dark Soulslike fantasy will be playable on PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X, and last-gen consoles, too, which is good news for anyone who missed out on the PS5/XSX-only demo last time.

As is usually the case, save data from your time with the demo will &quot;transfer to the final game&quot;, and if you complete it, you&#x27;ll unlock the &quot;Crouching Dragon Helmet&quot; DLC in the full game, too.

                              <span>Pedro Pascal has taken his gruff portrayal of The Last of Us&#x27; Joel and applied it to an entirely different kind of video game character: Mario.

In a spoof teaser for a completely made-up TV adaptation of Mario Kart on Saturday Night Live last night (4th February), Pascal and the SNL team showed what could happen if HBO applied the same kind of treatment to a Mario adaptation. And it&#x27;s brilliant. 

“HBO’s The Last of Us is a hit, proving that a video game can become a prestige dystopian drama. In Spring, HBO is doing it again with another iconic game,&quot; claims the profound - if overdramatic - voiceover.

                              <span>An American judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against Nintendo for its Joy-Con drift issues, saying the case cannot proceed because the owners agreed to Nintendo&#x27;s End User License Agreement (EULA) that &quot;disallows lawsuits&quot;.

Despite attempts to argue that underaged children - who used the handheld system - cannot enter into the agreement, the federal judge ultimately ruled that the agreement was with the &quot;de facto owners&quot;, the parents, and not the children who actually used the console. 

Consequently, the judge dismissed the action, stating that the parents should have entered legal arbitration rather than a lawsuit, as instructed by the EULA (thanks, NE).

As part of the first anniversary celebrations, Techland also revealed that it has a &quot;plethora of celebrations and updates for the community&quot;, including a 50 per cent off sale and hints that the franchise has plans to branch out to &quot;other medias&quot;.

There&#x27;ll be a week-long celebration wherein players can win goodies by completing community goals in the Bloody Anniversary event and Dropkick Weekend, where premium bundles can be won. And if you watch or participate in Dying Light 2 livestreams between now and 7th February, there&#x27;ll be more &quot;nostalgic swag via Twitch Drops&quot;, too.

                              <span>Capcom has released 12 whole minutes of new Resident Evil 4 Remake footage. 

Capcom partnered with Game Informer to share the new teaser, sharing &quot;an extended gameplay walkthrough of the game’s fifth chapter&quot;, set right after Leon meets Ashley. You can check it out below (thanks, Resetera):

As well as showing off the church and cemetery sequences - and lots of meaty combat, of course, including a battle with Luis Serra - the video also reveals a sneaky QTE (you&#x27;ll find it at 6.38 mins in) which is interesting given Resident Evil 4 Remake reportedly has &quot;barely any&quot; QTEs at all.

The 40-player battle royale mode introduces two new weapons - the long-range Grenade Launcher and the Scythe - as well as new premium character Ruby Knowby, voiced by Lucy Lawless. There&#x27;s also a new free Kandarian Facelift outfit for Pablo, too.

Alongside the free battle royale mode, players can also get hold of the Immortal Power DLC Bundle, which includes Ruby Knowby, who - as a dark one - can regenerate health, increase her possession resistance, and boost the damage of her weapons. She can also &quot;consume souls to make her aura stronger and charger her unique ability, triggering a deadly blast that damages evil units within range and heals nearby Survivors&quot;.

Bandai Namco invited fans to &quot;save the date&quot; of an anniversary event set to take place on 25th February in Stockholm, Sweden. Fans who can&#x27;t be there in person can join in via a livestream on Twitch.

The &quot;live show&quot; will host &quot;giveaways, contests, exclusive prizes, pub quiz, drinks, cosplay, and PvP&quot;. And whilst there&#x27;s no formal word about the eagerly-anticipated DLC, I doubt it&#x27;ll surprise you to hear that fans are desperately hoping that this may be when From Software finally drops more information. Watch this space, I guess.

Schafer - best known for games like Grim Fandango, Psychonauts, and Broken Age - will be honoured at the 26th annual DICE event later this month (not to be confused with EA&#x27;s Stockholm studio of the same name).

&quot;Tim&#x27;s creative impact on the industry cannot be understated,&quot; said Meggan Scavio, president of the AIAS. &quot;For over 30 years, he has heralded imaginative games that have inspired countless others with his humour and originality. We are thrilled for Tim to be inducted into our Hall of Fame.&quot;

                              <span>Activision Blizzard will pay $35m USD to settle charges raised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following a probe relating to workplace misconduct.


The SEC launched its investigation into Activision Blizzard in September 2021, subpoenaing CEO Bobby Kotick and other senior executives to provide their internal communications regarding the company&#x27;s response to the high-profile allegations of widespread misconduct and harassment within the company.


After concluding its investigation, the SEC charged that the publisher had failed to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that would ensure it could adequately collect and analyse employees&#x27; complaints of workplace misconduct. As a result, it said, Activision Blizzard&#x27;s management lacked sufficient information to &quot;understand the volume and substance of employee complaints about workplace misconduct&quot;, leaving it without the means to determine whether larger issues existed that needed to be disclosed to investors.

                              <span>Developer Smilegate has announced the impending closure of its year-old Xbox multiplayer shooter CrossfireX, which will shut down on 18th May - a move that&#x27;ll also affect its Remedy developed single-player campaign.


CrossfireX - the console version of Smilegate&#x27;s hugely popular PC shooter Crossfire - launched for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S last February, combining the multiplayer component of the PC original with a specially developed single-player campaign.


A little over a year on from that troubled launch, Smilegate has announced it&#x27;ll soon be ending support for the game. &quot;It is with the deepest regret that we are informing you of our decision to end support for CrossfireX on May 18, 2023,&quot; it wrote in a statement on its website. &quot;Since the launch of the game, we have worked tirelessly to bring it to a point where we can all be proud, and throughout it all we have had the honour and pleasure of supporting our players.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Innersloth has shared its development plans for the next 12 months of social deduction hit Among Us, confirming the year ahead will bring the likes of improved matchmaking and a brand-new map.


Innersloth&#x27;s roadmap is a little light in terms of ETAs, but it&#x27;s first order of business - user interface and user experience updates for Among Us - are said to be &quot;coming soon&quot;.


&quot;We want to make playing Among Us an easier, more intuitive experience,&quot; the developer explained in a post accompanying its new roadmap. &quot;This means big focus on adding multiple updates to the UI and UX...of the game. Cleaning up the account merging flow, updating the store to be easier to navigate, making it easier to see how you can report a toxic player... these are all things we want to work on, and more.&quot;

I have done a written interview and a  podcast interview about the book. It’s been chosen as a “February 2023 Must-Read Book” by the Next Big Idea Club. And an “Editor’s Pick”—whatever that means—on Amazon.
There have been three reviews so far. I am hoping for more. And maybe even a published excerpt or two.
Amazon and others will start shipping the book on Tuesday. If you ordered a signed copy from me, it is already in the mail.
If you can leave a review somewhere, I would appreciate it.

                              <span>The Last of Us: Part 1 will arrive on PC a little later than expected, with Naughty Dog announcing a new 28th March release date to ensure the game arrives &quot;in the best possible shape&quot;.


The Last of Us Part 1 - Naughty Dog&#x27;s new-gen spruce-up of the acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror - initially launched for PlayStation 5 last September, and the long-promised PC version was eventually confirmed to be arriving on 3rd March this year.


With a month to go until its originally planned launch date, however, Naughty Dog has confirmed a 25-day delay. &quot;Let&#x27;s get right to it,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We initially announced The Last of Us Part 1 PC release would be 3rd March, but we&#x27;ve decided to push its launch date out by just a few week; it will now be released on 28th March.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has responded to the European Union&#x27;s now-formalised antitrust warning, slapped down to contest its attempt at an Activision Blizzard acquistion. 


The EU&#x27;s intent to object to Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn deal was first reported last month. Now it has been finalised - and Microsoft has said it was &quot;confident&quot; it could address the issues raised.


As expected, the EU has intervened over a percieved risk in Microsoft owning Call of Duty, something it fears could reduce competition in the video games industry, Politico reported today.

                              <span>Legendary game designer Jeff Minter&#x27;s psychedelic reimagining of Atari&#x27;s &#x27;80s arcade prototype Akka Arrh comes to PC and consoles on 21st February.


The original Akka Arrh was created by Atari&#x27;s Mike Hally and Dave Ralston in 1982, but the unfinished prototype never went into full production and only three cabinets are still said to exist. More recently, however, the prototype did get an airing in last year&#x27;s superb Atari 50: Anniversary Celebration collection.


Minter&#x27;s reimagining of Akka Arrh will take the core of the original and build it out into &quot;a cascade of words, colour, shapes and sound [flowing] around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers&quot;.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Facial Misrecognition Systems: Simple Weight Manipulations Force DNNs to Err Only on Specific Persons“:
Abstract: In this paper we describe how to plant novel types of backdoors in any facial recognition model based on the popular architecture of deep Siamese neural networks, by mathematically changing a small fraction of its weights (i.e., without using any additional training or optimization). These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other’s existence with almost no interference...</span>

Observability requires the right data at the right time for the right consumer
(human or piece of software) to make the right decision. In the context of Kubernetes,
