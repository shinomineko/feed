                              <span>Team Cherry has quietly updated Steam assets for its highly-anticipated Hollow Knight sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong.

As spotted by Wario64 with the help of SteamDB, Hollow Knight: Silksong on Steam has had its first significant update since January 2023, with Team Cherry quietly swapping out a graphic for an updated version.

While it&#x27;s in no way indicative of an upcoming release date or anything like that – sorry – the changes to the storefront graphics are at least a sign that work is still underway behind the scenes, with the team twice uploading &quot;capsule art&quot; – that is, the artwork you see on the game&#x27;s storefront – in the last week, the most recent of which was uploaded earlier today.

But why read about it when you can see it for yourself? You can check out Dropoff&#x27;s handiwork in the video below:

                              <span>Supermassive Games&#x27; second instalment of the Dark Pictures Anthology, Little Hope, is coming to Nintendo Switch on 5th October 2023.

It follows Supermassive Games&#x27; efforts to bring the first The Dark Pictures Anthology title, Man of Medan, to Switch earlier this year, marking the second game of the horror series to come to Nintendo&#x27;s console.

Little Hope sees you follow a college class after the bus they were travelling in crashed in the middle of the night. As they explore the &quot;seemingly abandoned town&quot;, they become trapped by a &quot;mysterious impenetrable fog&quot; and begin to encounter visions of the townsfolk&#x27;s shocking history.

After a three-day early access period for some players, Payday 3 released on 21st September, but players have struggled to get online at peak times due to continuing server issues that have shutdown matchmaking, making it impossible to play the always-online heist shooter.

On launch day, Starbreeze took to its social media accounts to admit that it was &quot;currently experiencing slow matchmaking&quot; and was &quot;investigating and working on a solution&quot;.

                              <span>Ten days after Unity successfully enraged huge swathes of the development community by announcing sweeping, and wildly unpopular, changes to its Unity Engine business model, the company has said it&#x27;s &quot;sorry&quot; and walked back on significant aspects of its new pricing plan.


Last Tuesday, Unity announced that, as of 1st January 2024, developers would be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install on top of their existing licence subscription after reaching certain revenue and life-time instalment thresholds. The backlash was immediate and intense, resulting in minor revisions to Unity&#x27;s initial plan.


Now though, Unity&#x27;s Marc Whitten has outlined significant changes to last week&#x27;s announcement in a post on the company&#x27;s website, beginning with another apology. &quot;I want to start with this: I am sorry,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new Runtime Fee policy. Our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow, and keep deeply investing in our game engine.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Total War: Pharaoh next month, on 11th October, there&#x27;s a bit of bad news - for some purchasers, at least: developer Creative Assembly has announced it&#x27;s delaying the title into &quot;early 2024&quot;, but only on the Epic Games Store.


It&#x27;s a bit of an unusual one this, but Creative Assembly says the situation has arisen because it was &quot;recently asked to help support the integration of social functions before we can launch on the Epic Games Store, and we&#x27;ll need additional time to help make that happen&quot;.


Importantly, though, Total War: Pharaoh&#x27;s 11th October release will remain unchanged on Steam - and all pre-orders made on Epic have been automatically cancelled, should you want to take your business elsewhere. Creative Assembly says all affected customers should receive an email confirming this cancellation directly from the Epic Games Store support team.

                              <span>Valve has once again dropkicked the dreams right out of anyone hoping a whizzier, more powerful Steam Deck might be happening soon; it&#x27;s now provided a clearer timeframe for what it considers to be the current Steam Deck&#x27;s minimum life span, saying not to expect any kind of performance upgrade &quot;in the next couple of years&quot;.


Valve has, of course, tempered expectations for a souped-up Steam Deck sequel previously; in December, Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais said the company would likely keep a single performance spec, ie. the current one, for its handheld gaming PC &quot;a little bit longer&quot;, noting any initial hardware improvements would probably focus on screen and battery capacity.


But now, speaking to The Verge, Griffais has indicated that &quot;little bit&quot; will likely be a lot longer, and that any Steam Deck performance upgrades are still some considerable way off. &quot;It&#x27;s important to us that the Deck offers a fixed performance target for developers,&quot; he explained, &quot;and that the message to customers is simple, where every Deck can play the same games.&quot;

                              <span>If you cast your minds back to 2020, you may recall Spider-Man being a hot topic of conversation. This was not because he had just used his web-tastic athleticism to save a school bus of children from careering off the side of the road, or swept MJ off her feet (literally) before kissing her while upside down. 


Rather, he was a topic of conversation because Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games remastered its original 2018 game for the PlayStation 5, and at the same time changed up the look of its unmasked hero, Peter Parker. 


While Insomniac said this new model was a better reflection of actor Yuri Lowenthal&#x27;s facial capture, it caused a certain amount of upset for fans of the original. In fact, when the PC version of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man released last year, mods were made to bring Peter Parker&#x27;s original face back into the game. But, perhaps we should all be less concerned about the two different facial models for Peter and move on. After all, that&#x27;s what his actor wants. In fact, he just wants people to &quot;get over it&quot;.

                              <span>The third major patch for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is now being rolled out, and it includes the long-awaited Magic Mirror feature.
Players can now change their character&#x27;s appearance by finding the Magic Mirror in camp. Everything other than race and subrace of your character can be altered - though it also can&#x27;t be used to get rid of any &quot;cosmetic modifications that are a consequence of your gameplay choices&quot;. Also, origin characters, hirelings and full illithids can&#x27;t use the Magic Mirror.
Patch three has also added full support for the game on Mac, with Larian Studios recommending any players on Mac remove any mods and reinstall the game fresh before playing.

                              <span>Honkai Impact 3rd is getting a Part 2, with a new combat system and story that leaves previous protagonist Kiana behind.
Scheduled to release in February 2024, Part 2 will debut its new storyline on Mars, a new location for Impact 3rd, which previously contained its galactic adventures on Earth and its moon. Previously thought uninhabitable in Honkai lore, Mars actually offers a &quot;unique civilization and nature&quot;  where &quot;there may also be mysteries hidden behind the daily lives of residents that have yet to be discovered&quot;.
In addition to expanding its reach further into the solar system, Part 2 debuts a cast of &quot;new partners from different cultures&quot;, introducing brand new main characters and NPCs alongside our shiny new playable character, a Martian native team supporter named Dreamseeker.

                              <span>Yesterday, Activision announced what players can expect in Season 6 of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone, The Haunting, which has a spooky theme just in time for Halloween.
A number of crossovers with other franchises are always to be expected, and this Season players will be able to purchase some horror (and horror adjacent) icons as Operators. 
Diablo&#x27;s Lilith and Inarius (everybody&#x27;s favourite Mother and Father from hell), He-Man nemesis Skeletor, Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, and Alucard from the manga series Hellsing will all be entering the fray.

                              <span>Lego has announced another Super Mario set - this time, a shelf-sized model of a Piranha Plant.


Measuring 23cm high by 11cm wide, the 540-piece design will launch in the UK on 6th November, at the comparatively affordable (for Lego) price of £58.


This is another of Lego&#x27;s Super Mario range for older fans (albeit those still young at heart), rather than its kid-focused line of Super Mario sets which interact with its electronic Super Mario, Luigi and Peach toys.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s retro library is growing bigger yet again with another Kirby addition.
On 29th September, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror will be available to play via the Game Boy Advance emulation service. You&#x27;ll need a Switch Online subscription and the Expansion Pack to access it.
Kirby and the Amazing Mirror was released in 2004 for GBA and it tells the story of Kirby, who accidentally gets split into four different Kirbys, as he saves the Mirror World from dark corruption. The original release supported local multiplayer via Game Link Cable.

                              <span>A cosy new hobbit-based Lord of the Rings spinoff game has been teased by Wētā Workshop and Private Division. Yes, it is actually happening.


Tales of the Shire was announced to celebrate Hobbit Day, and promises to provide a snuggly &quot;heart-warming&quot; experience set in Tolkein&#x27;s Middle-earth universe. It&#x27;s coming from Wētā Workshop and Private Division and will arrive sometime next year. Needless to say, I am more than a little bit excited.


To accompany this announcement, a small teaser was also released. It is short and suitably charming, showing a young person humming as she sits at a table strewn with flora and art supplies. There are also modern bits and pieces, such as headphones. She is painting in a book, and while I have nothing to base this on other than my hunch, she looks to be painting herself as a hobbit. Could this be Tales of the Shire&#x27;s soon to be pint-sized protagonist?

                              <span>In a positive development for Microsoft, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has &quot;provisionally concluded&quot; the company&#x27;s revised deal to purchase Activision Blizzard will be enough to grant approval.


Back in April, the CMA made the shock decision to block Microsoft&#x27;s proposed deal to acquire the Call of Duty maker. At this time, the regulatory body cited concerns relating to the cloud gaming sector, stating that the deal risked &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;.


In August, Microsoft submitted a revised proposal in a bid to appease the regulator, saying it would now sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be accepted.

                              <span>Ubisoft sure does love a sequel, and it&#x27;s now confirmed - in just about as understated a fashion as is possible - that it&#x27;s got another one in the works, this time in the form of The Division 3.


News of The Division 3&#x27;s existence comes not via a flashy announcement trailer or Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot bellowing the news through a megaphone while sat astride a glitter cannon, but instead tucked away in a press release announcing something else entirely.


Specifically, Ubisoft today disseminated a press release among news outlets announcing that Julian Gerighty - the creative director of next year&#x27;s eagerly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws - has been appointed new executive producer of its Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division brand.

                              <span>Seeing everything there is to see in developer Larian Studios&#x27; ludicrously vast Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is already something of an impossible task, but Astarion actor Neil Newbon has now raised the stakes even higher, claiming it features a two-hour secret section that no-one&#x27;s yet found.


During one of Newbon&#x27;s regular Twitch livestreams, aired at the end of last month (thanks GamesRadar), the voice of everyone&#x27;s favourite perfectly coiffured glampire teased that, &quot;There&#x27;s even something I know about that you can&#x27;t get to unless you do something that I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s going to work out&quot;.


Sadly, Newbon - who was told about the mysterious &quot;two hours of content&quot; in confidence and is likely &quot;one of the few people that knows about it&quot; - wouldn&#x27;t even offer a &quot;vague clue or hint&quot; when asked. He did, however, tease that &quot;at some point, somebody will find it for a very specific reason&quot; - so it seems like getting to the bottom of this one will be squarely in the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 community&#x27;s court.

                              <span>As part of its Tokyo Game Showcase, Capcom has shared nine minutes of new Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 gameplay footage, this time focusing on vocations - basically the series&#x27; version of classes - as well as offering a little look at some of the major locations in its world.


At the game&#x27;s outset, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma provides a choice between four vocations - fighter, mage, thief, and archer - each determining a player&#x27;s style of play, but more will become available as events progress - and vocations can be changed by visiting Vocation Guilds, should you want to mix things up.


The fighter, for instance, specialises in one-handed sword and shield combat for short-range attacks and defensive manoeuvring. The archer, meanwhile, is better suited to taking down enemies - which are said to be behave organically out the world - from a distance using their bow and arrow, which can support the likes of exploding and blighting arrows.

                              <span>Five and a half years and endless requests from the community later, Rare has announced it&#x27;ll finally be adding private servers to Sea of Thieves - meaning a single crew of up to four players can explore the world without fear of PvP encounters - starting this December, as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure&#x27;s Season 10.


Season 10 itself gets underway on 19th October, and will introduce a major new feature each month ahead of 2024 - essentially meaning all content originally planned for 2023 will arrive before the end of the year, despite a painfully protracted, seven-month-long Season 9.


First up, on 19th October, Sea of Thieves will introduce Guilds, described as a &quot;new way for players to form meaningful bonds beyond their immediate crew&quot;. Essentially, any player that&#x27;s reached Captain status and has their own ship can start a guild - picking a name, logo, and emblem when then do so - which can then support up to 24 invited players.

As part of the studio&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show presentation, Capcom revealedthe second season of its mech-tastic dino shooter will be going live on 18th October. Players can expect a variety of additions on this date, including a new map known as Ocean Platform.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Now, the latest free-to-play Pokémon Go-style augmented reality creature-battler from developer Niantic, made in collaboration with Capcom, has officially surpassed 5m downloads in its first week of release on iOS and Android.


Monster Hunter Now, which was announced back in February and got its full launch on 21st September following a series of closed beta tests, employs a similar real-world exploration and interaction system to the ones seen in the likes of Niantic&#x27;s Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom, albeit with an obvious Monster Hunter twist.


Here, players are able to gather useful resources and fight monsters they encounter while out on their real-world travels - including the Barroth, Tobi Kadachi, Jyuratodus, Paolumu, Anjanath, Rathian, Rathalos, and Diablos - then combine their spoils to create better equipment that&#x27;ll enable them to take on tougher challenges.

This closed alpha will be accessible to players who sign up for an account at Everywhere.game.


A new trailer for Everywhere, released today, shows some of the biomes you can explore and play around with in the game, as well as some swooping camera pans through its Ready Player One-style hub. There&#x27;s also a glimpse at some of the types of mini-games you can build and a brief look at the game&#x27;s editor mode, which lets you tweak creations you&#x27;ve made on the fly.

                              <span>Valve has released the dates for the first Steam sales planned for next year.
Yes, as Valve gently reminds us in its announcement post (even if I wish it didn&#x27;t), &quot;2024 isn&#x27;t exactly that far away&quot;, so the dates for its upcoming sales have been published to allow developers to prepare their applications for inclusion in the relevant events. 
Confirmed sale dates include the usual Spring Sale, the next edition of Steam Next Fest, and a number of themed events.

                              <span>As part of this morning&#x27;s Xbox Digital Broadcast at Tokyo Game Show, we got our first look at Hotel Barcelona. 


This upcoming release is a time-looping action game from Hidetaka &quot;Swery&quot; Suehiro and Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda, two legends of game development. It promises to serve us all up some &quot;2.5D slasher film parodic action&quot;.


So, what&#x27;s it actually all about? Well, Hotel Barcelona is where America&#x27;s serial killers have all decided to reconvene. And, according to the official trailer blurb, players will need to defeat this murderous bunch and &quot;check out before all the blood is spilled&quot;.

The award - which is of course coloured gold - is designed to reward previous members of the service. 


&quot;Xbox Live Gold 2002 - 2023&quot;, the award states, referring to the 21 years since Microsoft first launched Xbox Live for the original Xbox.

                              <span>Party Animals, previously one of the most wishlisted games on Steam, has come under fire since its release earlier this week, with scores of players calling out developer Recreate Games for what they say was false advertising. 


This all stems from the game&#x27;s description of its offline (and online) multiplayer, which originally read: &quot;Paw it out with your friends both online and offline&quot;.


But Party Animals does not have an offline mode. As a result, many owners have left negative comments about the release.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Microsoft was party to a monumental set of leaks that detailed everything from console plans to video game roadmaps. It also revealed email exchanges between Microsoft&#x27;s execs, where Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond and others discussed potential games for the company&#x27;s Game Pass subscription service. 


One such game was Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, the recent hit from developer Larian. As we previously reported, Microsoft estimated it would take $5m to get Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 on Game Pass, with the company dubbing the game a &quot;second-run Stadia PC RPG&quot;.


Needless to say, given the huge success of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Microsoft underestimated its potential. But Larian isn&#x27;t mad about this. Rather, it has said it understands the situation, with the studio&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse saying it &quot;comes with the genre&quot;.

Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name and Like a Dragon: Ishin! will both be coming to Xbox Game Pass, with the former joining on its day of release on 9th November, and the latter coming sometime &quot;this year&quot;.

It&#x27;s now receiving more criticism thanks to the official trailer posted on Nintendo of America&#x27;s YouTube channel, which seemingly includes PC gameplay to advertise the Switch version of the game.

A description of the game&#x27;s most violent moments has now been published by the ESRB, the US ratings board, which has given Modern Warfare 3 an M rating for Mature. 


&quot;A handful of sequences depict more intense acts of violence,&quot; the ESRB writes, including a mission which includes &quot;terrorists (dressed as police officers and paramedics) shooting/killing fleeing civilians inside a stadium concourse&quot;.

                              <span>After two rip-roaring outings, Sea of Thieves&#x27; wonderful Monkey Island adventure will soon reach its end; Rare has now confirmed its third and final instalment will launch next Thursday, 28th September - clearing the way for the pirate game&#x27;s tenth season on 19th October.


Sea of Thieves&#x27; three-part The Legend of Monkey Island adventure got underway back in July, sending players on a quest to Mêlée Island where, thanks to the mysterious power of the Sea of the Damned, Guybrush Threepwood had become the mightiest pirate of all. It was a wonderful opening episode, managing to capture the magic (if perhaps not the humour) of the point-and-click classic, and things only got better in last month&#x27;s vastly more open-ended part two.


Episode three, titled The Lair of LeChuck, whisks players away to an absolutely gorgeous rendition of Monkey Island itself - which you can see a bit of at the 4:49 mark in Sea of Thieves&#x27; latest news update below - spanning everything from dense jungle to lava-filled catacombs.

                              <span>Glen Schofield, the co-creator of Dead Space, is departing his Striking Distance Studios following the commercial failure of its first game, sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol. 


Schofield founded Striking Distance Studios in 2019, under the wing of a Korean publisher Krafton Inc., which was looking to create a narrative-based game that would expand its PUBG: Battlegrounds universe - although, notably, all connections to PUBG had been excised by the time The Callisto Protocol launched in December last year.


Unfortunately, The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s critical reception was mixed and the game was met with lower-than-anticipated sales. In January, it was reported that Krafton had expected to shift five million copies of The Callisto Protocol - whose three-year development had cost it £132m - but that it was unlikely to hit its target, given just two million copies had been sold at the time.

                              <span>Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has confirmed ten employees have lost their jobs as part of an &quot;internal restructuring&quot; programme, following multiple accounts from employees that the studio had been hit with lay offs today.


Senior brand manager Nicholas Edwards announced his departure from Crystal Dynamics in a message shared on LinkedIn, revealing he was &quot;one of a number of people impacted by the latest round of Embracer layoffs&quot; at the studio. Edwards noted today&#x27;s job cuts had affected a broad spread of departments, including PR, project management, 2D art, and video editing.


Crystal Dynamics&#x27; communications director Adam Kahn also confirmed he&#x27;d been affected by today&#x27;s layoffs, as did senior community and social media manager Neha Nair. &quot;After 3.5 years at Crystal Dynamics,&quot; Nair wrote, &quot;I was laid off today.&quot;

                              <span>Following the surprise news that Paradox Interactive&#x27;s beleaguered Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is now in the hands of  Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs studio The Chinese Room, the developer has talked a little about its goals for the rejuvenated project, saying it&#x27;s building its action around &#x27;doing things only a vampire can&#x27;.


Bloodlines 2 has, of course, had a tumultuous journey since its unveiling back in 2019; original developer Hardsuit Labs was ditched following a number of controversies, almost resulting in the cancellation of the game, but Paradox eventually confirmed development had been handed to a new studio, now known to be The Chinese Room, sometime in 2021.


Bloodlines 2&#x27;s re-reveal earlier this month was fairly light on detail, but Paradox did say the game would cast players as an Elder vampire in the &quot;dark underbelly of Seattle, where vampires struggle for survival and supremacy&quot;. It also confirmed there&#x27;d be characters for players to chat with, combat, a need to keep a low profile to ensure vampire society stays hidden from humanity, and &quot;complex political relationships&quot;.

I recently published an essay about my experiences ten years ago.</span>

                              <span>UK regulatory body the Competition and Markets Authority is reportedly preparing to share its preliminary judgement on Microsoft&#x27;s revised Activision Blizzard deal next week.


The CMA is, of course, Microsoft&#x27;s last remaining hurdle in getting its proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard over the finish line after the UK regulator made the shock decision to block the deal in April, highlighting concerns relating to the burgeoning cloud gaming sector and arguing the deal would risk &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;. 


Following the CMA&#x27;s decision - and the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s failure to secure a temporary halt on the deal in a US court - Microsoft returned to the UK regulator with a revised proposal, saying it would sell the streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard games released in the next 15 years to Ubisoft should the new deal be approved.

                              <span>Criterion, the British studio behind recent Need for Speed titles and the classic Burnout series, will now focus the majority of its efforts on EA&#x27;s Battlefield shooter franchise.


A smaller &quot;core group&quot; within Criterion will continue on with Need for Speed, meanwhile.


Criterion has of course worked on Battlefield before, and contributed bits to DICE&#x27;s Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 (it also helped out on Star Wars Battlefront 2). The talented team will now turn its efforts back to improving 2042, and to the future of the Battlefield franchise overall.

                              <span>The first trailer for Netflix&#x27;s anime adaptation of Onimusha has been released ahead of the series&#x27; premiere on 2nd November.

The adaptation was revealed a year ago byCapcom, along with a few stills from the show. Its protagonist is Musashi Miyamoto, whose likeness is modelled after prolific Japanese actor Mifune Toshiro (best known for his roles in Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s films including Seven Samurai). The series is directed by Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer, 13 Assassins).

The new trailer shows snippets of action sequences and reveals hints of the plot. Netflix describes the first episode as &quot;the beginning of an intense series full of realistic action in which Musashi&#x27;s blade slices through evil as he traverses a land plagued by poverty&quot;.

                              <span>When Yakuza: Like a Dragon released in 2020, there was an odd situation where the PS5 version released four months after the Xbox Series X/S version, with no explanations given.
Thanks to the huge leak of documents accidentally uploaded by Microsoft to the US FTC, we now know why the PS5 version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon was released later than its Xbox next-gen counterparts. 
In a series of emails dated 1st June 2020, Xbox execs Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond, and Damon Baker (who has since left Microsoft and joined publisher Kepler Interactive) discuss how the company essentially ended up with a timed exclusive on next-gen consoles thanks to a number of caveats with certain deals struck between itself, Sega and Sony.

RGG has also released a story trailer which sets up the events of Infinite Wealth. Protagonist Ichiban Kasuga is sent to Hawaii to look for his long lost mother, Akane. Once he arrives, he ends up being ambushed as many local factions are also searching for Akane. 
Series poster boy Kazuma Kiryu has also been sent to find Akane by the Daidoji faction, and he teams up with Ichiban to fully dismantle the Yakuza in Japan.

Re-Logic does not even use Unity, but in a statement via X (formerly Twitter) the developer said it felt it &quot;cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere&quot;.


Godot and FNA will receive $100k each, and Re-Logic will also continue sponsoring both with a further $1k per month. &quot;All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere,&quot; said Re-Logic.

You&#x27;ll need just 40GB of storage to install Mirage, with a variety of CPUs and GPUs supported for running the game somewhere between 1080p 30fps and up to 4K and 60fps.


On the low end, you&#x27;re looking at a Nvidia GeForce 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 570 with 8GB RAM. On the high end, you&#x27;ll need a Nvidia GeForce 3080 or AMD Radeon 6900 with 16GB RAM.

Bluey the cartoon follows the adventures of the eponymous Blue Heeler dog, her sister Bingo, mum Chilli, and dad Bandit. All are along for the ride in Bluey: The Videogame, which promises an &quot;interactive sandbox adventure&quot; for up to four players, featuring fully explorable recreations of some of the show&#x27;s most recognisable locations.


There&#x27;s talk of &quot;story-driven episodic gameplay&quot;, split into four parts, that&#x27;ll include activities and mini-games inspired by the cartoon - Keepy Uppy and Magic Xylophone are mentioned - with players able to unlock new costumes, stickers, episodes, and locations as they go.

                              <span>Saber Interactive has announced it&#x27;s ending development of last year&#x27;s Evil Dead: The Game - meaning no new content will be produced and the planned Switch version is now cancelled.


Evil Dead: The Game - which launched onto Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last May - is another entry in the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre that&#x27;s already bought us the likes of Dead by Daylight and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this one pitting a cast of familiar faces from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell&#x27;s Ash Williams, against the Deadite hordes.


Since its release, sporadic post-launch support has introduced a castle map inspired by Army of Darkness, new outfits, a number of characters, the new Plaguebringer class, and a new Splatter Royale mode. April saw the previously Epic Games Store-exclusive title make the jump to Steam on PC, but content updates fizzled out after that - and now Saber Interactive has confirmed development has reached its end.

                              <span>UPDATE 20/9/23: Following the release of Xbox boss Phil Spencer&#x27;s public statement on social media addressing recent leaks, The Verge has obtained a copy of a more substantial internal memo circulated among Microsoft employees:


&quot;Today, several documents submitted in the court proceedings related to our proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard were unintentionally disclosed. I know this is disappointing, even if many of the documents are well over a year old and our plans have evolved.


&quot;I also know we all take the confidentiality of our plans and our partners’ information very seriously. This leak obviously is not us living up to that expectation. We will learn from what happened and be better going forward. We all put incredible amounts of passion and energy into our work, and this is never how we want that hard work to be shared with the community. That said, there’s so much more to be excited about, and when we’re ready, we’ll share the real plans with our players.

                              <span>Following today&#x27;s mega-sized Xbox leak - which has given us word of a planned digital-only Xbox Series X/S refresh and new controller, a tantalising Bethesda release roadmap, first details of a brand-new Xbox in 2028, confirmation Xbox boss Phil Spencer is awfully keen to buy Nintendo, and more - the US Federal Trade Commission has stepped forward to quell any bubbling conspiracy theories and emphatically state it was not responsible (it was Microsoft).


Today&#x27;s barrage of Xbox news all came from confidential Xbox documents, dated April 2022, that were originally shared by Microsoft as part of the FTC&#x27;s case against the company&#x27;s proposed $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. These documents then surfaced publicly last night, providing access to a treasure trove of fully unredacted internal details.


Predictably, internet conspiracy theories have ebbed and flowed throughout to the day regarding who might be have been responsible for the leak and why - but the FTC has moved to make it abundantly clear it wasn&#x27;t involved, begining with a statement from Douglas Farrar, the commission&#x27;s office of public affairs director, on social media.

Global cybersecurity job vacancies grew by 350 percent, from one million openings in 2013 to 3.5 million in 2021, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The number of unfilled jobs leveled off in 2022, and remains at 3.5 million in 2023, with more than 750,000 of those positions in the U.S. Industry efforts to source new talent and tackle burnout continues, but we predict that the disparity between demand and supply will remain through at least 2025.

                              <span>Tekken 8&#x27;s Closed Network Tests are regrettably no more (regrettable if you too find unintended joy in unfortunately selected acronyms), as Bandai Namco has announced it&#x27;ll be launching the fighter&#x27;s first Closed Beta Test this October. 


So while we must sadly bid a fond farewell to the publisher&#x27;s eye-catching Tekken 8 CNT graphic, we do at least get to snicker at its replacement (I&#x27;m assuming nobody at Bandai Namco thought to run &#x27;CBT&#x27; through the internet first either) when the next bout of testing gets underway at 8am BST on 20th October. Proceedings will run until 9am on 23rd October, with three hours of downtime scheduled between 9am and 12pm on the 21st.


Once again, players across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Steam can get involved (Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus subscriptions are not required), and once again places are limited, so those interested in participating will need to register their interest beforehand. Registration closes at 8am on 11th October and successful applicants will be notified starting at 8am on the 18th. Additionally, Bandai Namco notes successful CNT entrants can play without re-registering.

                              <span>Xbox has announced the next wave of games to join the Game Pass library.
The second half of September is chock full of games available on day one with Game Pass, including Soulslike Lies of P which is already out on cloud, console and PC. We gave it three out of five stars in our review, Caelyn Ellis called it &quot;an enjoyable experience for those in need of a FromSoft fix&quot;.
Tomorrow, multiplayer party game Party Animals joins Game Pass on day one on cloud and console. I had a blast playing Party Animals with Ed and Victoria for a preview a few months back. It&#x27;s difficult to not enjoy a game with cute animals, floppy physics, and oversized weapons.

                              <span>The recent leak of internal Microsoft documents gives an indication as to what the company expects to pay to get games on Xbox Game Pass.


For instance, Microsoft estimated it would take $300m to get Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on Game Pass, or $250m for either Mortal Kombat 1 or Suicide Squad.


As we reported earlier today, a 2022 email thread initiated by Phil Spencer had Microsoft scrambling to fill the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield&#x27;s delay and included a long list of potential third-party games.

The feature was confirmed by associate animation director James Ham in an interview with Gamertag Radio.
The ability to switch between Peter and Miles is a new addition for this sequel and switching characters will be &quot;almost&quot; instantaneous. But what happens to the other character that you&#x27;re not controlling in the open world?

                              <span>French President Emmanuel Macron has clarified his view on video games after previously blaming recent riots on the culture of video games.


Now, in a new statement on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said he startled gamers - or, he literally &quot;made the gamers jump&quot; - with his words and that really he &quot;always considered that video games are an opportunity for France, for our youth and its future, for our jobs and our economy&quot;.


He continued: &quot;I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks. It is this violence that I condemn, not video games.

                              <span>Nintendo is set to update F-Zero 99 with more courses and modes in the near future.


First up, Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese web page for the game states that two sets of courses will be added. The first will be in late September and taken from the Queen League; the second will be mid-October and from the King League.



At present, the courses in the game are mainly taken from the Knight League, so expect some trickier races in the near future.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing what feels like the biggest leak of Xbox gaming news in history, which has left Microsoft&#x27;s plans to launch new hardware in 2024 and a new console generation in 2028 exposed. 
Next year&#x27;s redesigned Xbox Series X is digital only, according to documents from 2022 that Microsoft presented to the FTC this year. It does not appear to boast a bump in processing power - something that gels with what Xbox boss Phil Spencer told me at Gamescom last month - but also ditches the ability to play older games on disc. How does that square with Microsoft&#x27;s push for game preservation?
Looking further ahead, Microsoft has pinned 2028 as the year we&#x27;ll finally see the Xbox Series X&#x27;s proper successor arrive. Is that too late? And what does it mean that the console will support &quot;cloud hybrid&quot; games?

The document shared this time was a flight manual for the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, Niche Gamer reported. Information such as sensor locations, firing angles, and engine specifications were shown on the pages circulated on the thread.
The entire thread has since been deleted, though developer Gaijin Entertainment confirmed the information had been posted onto its forum.

                              <span>Phil Spencer admitted the hole in Game Pass left by Starfield&#x27;s delay was a &quot;disaster situation&quot; and suggested FromSoftware&#x27;s Dark Souls games to plug the gap following the success of Elden Ring, among other third-party releases.


Today&#x27;s enormous leak of internal Microsoft documents includes a particularly candid email from Spencer sent in May 2022, revealing his frustration around &quot;a huge hole with our games lineup&quot;. That was due to Starfield&#x27;s delay, &quot;not a tonne of clarity on the launch date of Redfall&quot;, and Stalker 2 development impacted by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.


&quot;We keep talking about a big AAA a quarter in the service [Game Pass] and it feels like we are likely to go through a gap of almost 16 months between big exclusive launches on our platform,&quot; Spencer lamented.

                              <span>The developer of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has recommended PlayStation 5 owners take their console offline to fix a sudden spate of game crashes.


Larian noted last night that &quot;some PS5 players&quot; were &quot;experiencing sudden Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 crashes in what appears to be a PSN-related issue&quot;.


&quot;We&#x27;re investigating the problem,&quot; Larian continued, via a post on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;But for now, the workaround is to disconnet your PS5 from the internet.&quot;

                              <span>Shadows of Doubt, the ambitious procedural detective noir sandbox from developer Cole Jefferies, is introducing new cases themed around infidelity on 25th September, as part of its first major update since entering Steam early access in April.


Shadows of Doubt, for those in need of a quick refresher, is a first-person, open-world detective sim set in a noirish sci-fi city. Its unique selling point, however, is that procedural generation governs virtually every aspect of it in a bid to create an endlessly replayable crime-solving caper - from the layout of its city streets to the schedules of its citizens, right through to the cases you&#x27;ll need to solve through stealth, subtrefuge, and sleuthing.


And from next Monday, 25th September, come the arrival of its Cheats and Liars update, Shadows of Doubt will have another trick in its toolbox - as players might just find themselves asked to investigate cases of infidelity, should it suit the procedural generation&#x27;s whims.

                              <span>Phil Spencer described Nintendo as &quot;THE prime asset&quot; in a leaked internal email concerning possible Microsoft acquisitions.


The email chain, sent in 2020 between Spencer, chief marketing officer Chris Capossela, and commercial chief marketing officer Takeshi Numoto, discusses the possibility of acquiring Nintendo at some point in the future, with Numoto initially noting Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;rich set of franchises&quot;.


&quot;I totally agree that Nintendo is THE prime asset for us in gaming and today gaming is our most likely path to consumer relevance,&quot; replied Spencer.

The company&#x27;s mid-gen refresh is slated to arrive in 2024, four years before plans for a proper next-gen Xbox console expected in 2028.


Next year&#x27;s new Xbox Series X (codenamed &quot;Brooklin&quot;) will be all-digital and sports a new cyclindrical design. It&#x27;s set for launch next October.

The Home Chef Hustle Stuff Pack essentially features four components: there&#x27;s new kitchen decor, new cooking attire, new small appliances, plus the ability to cart all your culinary creations out into the street to sell at a food stall and make some Simoleons along the way.


In terms of decor, you get counters, cabinets, and matching home appliances (oven, fridge, and dishwasher to be specific), all taking a cue from European designs, while the new small appliances come in the form of a Stand Mixer, Waffle Maker, and Countertop Pizza Oven - the latter also capable of cooking focaccia bread if pizza isn&#x27;t your thing.

                              <span>A week after Unity announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model - drawing immediate and widespread condemnation from the development community - the company has reportedly told staff it&#x27;ll be making adjustments to the controversial new pricing plan.


As reported by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Unity leadership addressed employees in an all-hands meeting held earlier today (a meeting originally planned for late last week was cancelled following a &quot;potential threat&quot; from an employee), saying the company was &quot;considering&quot; introducing a cap on its hugely unpopular new per-install fees.


Unity initially caused an outcry last Tuesday, when it told developers that, on top of their existing Unity Engine licence subscription, they&#x27;d be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee each time a user installed their game, starting on 1st January 2024. This would apply to all games, including those already on the market, that had made $200k USD or more in the last 12 months and had at least 200k lifetime game installs.

                              <span>In news that isn&#x27;t likely to be much of a surprise to anyone at this point, a newly unearthed Microsoft court document has confirmed The Elder Scrolls 6 won&#x27;t be making its way to PlayStation when it eventually shows up in 2026 or beyond.


Microsoft submitted the document (thanks The Verge) as part of its court battle with the US Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard - the same court proceedings that saw Xbox boss Phil Spencer answer an FTC attorney&#x27;s questions about The Elder Scrolls 6&#x27;s Xbox exclusivity by saying, &quot;I think we&#x27;ve been a little unclear on what platforms it&#x27;s launching on, given how far out the game is. It&#x27;s difficult for us right now to nail down... It&#x27;s so far out it&#x27;s hard to understand what the platforms will even be at this point.&quot;


Despite Spencer&#x27;s noncommital answer back in June, Microsoft&#x27;s newly released court documents make it explicitly clear The Elder Scrolls 6 won&#x27;t be coming to a PlayStation console.

                              <span>There are no reliable ways to distinguish text written by a human from text written by an large language model. OpenAI writes:
Do AI detectors work?
In short, no. While some (including OpenAI) have released tools that purport to detect AI-generated content, none of these have proven to reliably distinguish between AI-generated and human-generated content.
Additionally, ChatGPT has no “knowledge” of what content could be AI-generated. It will sometimes make up responses to questions like “did you write this [essay]?” or “could this have been written by AI?” These responses are random and have no basis in fact.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick was briefed by Nintendo on Switch 2 in December last year. 


Emails between Activision executives - made public as part of the FTC&#x27;s court case with Microsoft and published today by The Verge, albeit with many redactions - show that the company&#x27;s controversial boss Bobby Kotick spoke with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa about Switch 2 at the end of 2022.


Activision exec Chris Schnakenberg noted that the console was expected to be weigh in with a &quot;closer alignment to Gen 8 platforms in terms of performance&quot;, referring to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles.

                              <span>It&#x27;s quite hard to believe it, but yes - yesterday marked 10 years since GTA 5 first released on PS3 and Xbox 360. 


It&#x27;s undoubtedly become a milestone of recent gaming history, driven by an impressive figure of over 160m lifetime sales, critical reception, and endless controversies from developer Rockstar Games and its parent company Take-Two. The popular multiplayer mode, GTA Online, continues to stand the test of time as Rockstar continually adds new updates and content. 


As Rockstar works on GTA 6 and Take-Two suggests it might be released as early as next year, now feels like an appropriate moment to take stock of the achievements, missteps, and musings that surround GTA 5.

In an interview with IGN, Insomniac&#x27;s director of core technology Mike Fitzgerald and project director Jeannette Lee shared more about the studio&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive. 


The developers said the game was the &quot;culmination of everything [Insomniac has] learned&quot; about developing for PlayStation 5.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 released in early access last week across Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Since then, several users have uploaded footage and screenshots showcasing the Switch version of the game - and the results aren&#x27;t great. 


In fact, the version available on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console has been widely panned, with many wondering how the developer can ask the same price on Switch as on other platforms. 


Fans have taken to the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok to question NetherRealm&#x27;s decision to market Mortal Kombat 1 as a $70 Switch release. It has been called &quot;robbery&quot; and &quot;disrespectful&quot; to users.

It&#x27;s now available on Steam with a 90 percent discount for just £2.99. Similarly, on PSN and Xbox it&#x27;s £4.49.


Back in January, Crystal Dynamics announced that support for the live-service game would end on 30th September this year and will no longer be available to purchase after this date. Its final update was at the end of March.

The plans prompted an enormous backlash from developers across the industry, and threw up a multitude of questions around how the new policy would work in practice - answers which Unity belatedly scrambled to work out itself.


This morning, Unity said it was sorry for the &quot;confusion and angst&quot; its changes had caused, and promised it would make unspecified &quot;changes&quot; to its plans.

                              <span>Remember last November, when hackers broke into the network for LastPass—a password database—and stole password vaults with both encrypted and plaintext data for over 25 million users?
Well, they’re now using that data break into crypto wallets and drain them: $35 million and counting, all going into a single wallet.
That’s a really profitable hack. (It’s also bad opsec. The hackers need to move and launder all that money quickly.)
Look, I know that online password databases are more convenient. But they’re also risky. This is why my Password Safe...</span>

                              <span>Fables author and artist Bill Willingham – yes, the same Bill Willingham behind Telltale&#x27;s The Wolf Among Us game – has put the rights to the Fables intellectual property into the public domain.

&quot;As of now, 15 September 2023, the comic book property called Fables, including all related Fables spin-offs and characters, is now in the public domain,&quot; Willingham wrote on his substack. &quot;What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time. It’s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.&quot;

Wondering why Willingham has done this? You&#x27;re not alone. The author said he&#x27;s made the decision to move everything into the public domain for &quot;a number of reasons&quot;, including &quot;practicality&quot; – Willingham feels much has changed since he first signed his contract with DC Comics – and &quot;philosophy&quot;, as his &quot;thoughts on how to reform the trademark and copyright laws in this country (and others, I suppose) have undergone something of a radical transformation&quot;.

Just like Skyrim&#x27;s old infinite money glitch, players have found a sneaky way to rob the Shepherd&#x27;s General Store if they&#x27;re in third-person and situate themselves just-so in front of a very unassuming puddle.

&quot;WOW,&quot; YouTuber JamieMoranUK posted to X/Twitter. &quot;If you go to Akila City, look in a puddle in front of the store, Shepherds. You can get all the store&#x27;s inventory for FREE.

The &quot;creature-raising survival game&quot; lets you explore an open-world, alien planet, raise your own loddles, clear up debris with your bubble gun, recycle trash to create upgrades and more helpful items, and unlock new gadgets to ensure you can clear up even the most stubborn ocean pollution.

Not sure if this kind of &quot;cosy pollution-cleaning adventure awash with creature-raising and survival systems&quot; is for you? To help you make up your mind, a demo is now available on Steam for PC and – wait for it – Mac players to give it a go.

&quot;SIX MILLION PLAYERS have explored Ghostwire: Tokyo&#x27;s spooky streets!&quot; the team said in a tweet. &quot;That doesn&#x27;t make those eerie alleyways any less haunted, of course... Thank you again to all our fans!&quot;

Nexus says that whilst the mod&#x27;s removal was &quot;not a political statement or an alignment to one side or the other in the culture war&quot;, it reserved the right &quot;not to host&quot; the mod on its platform.

&quot;Hosting this mod was not for us and it is certainly within our rights not to host content on our platform,&quot; NexusMods told 404 Media.

                              <span>NetherRealm has deployed a day-one patch for Mortal Kombat 1 on consoles and Switch.

The patch notes reveal that for both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, improvements include &quot;fleshed out&quot; accessibility options – see below – as well as character &quot;polish and tuning&quot;, &quot;improved and refined&quot; UI, and the addition of &quot;numerous finishing moves&quot;.

There are also some tweaks to the online system, including improvements to the matchmaking and &quot;online mode bugs&quot;, with the story campaign getting a little TLC, too, including movie player improvements, 4K resolution, the tuning of &quot;story finale and final boss&quot;, plus a liberal application of &quot;visual polish&quot; to a number of cinematic sequences.

&quot;Asking direct questions to look forward and build a better, progressive future for women in games and esports around the world&quot;, the online conference will take place on 10th October, 2023. Tickets cost £30.

&quot;From questions based on original research about representation such as &#x27;What&#x27;s going wrong with women&#x27;s dialogue in video games?&#x27;, to questions from returning innovators about pay such as &#x27;Salary Transparency: Breaking the Game or Path to Success?&#x27;, the Women in Games Annual Global Conference will offer abundant challenges to the prevailing lack of fairness, whether that be in work or play environments,&quot; a press release says.

In a concise update posted to Steam, Starbreeze simply said hello to its heisters and revealed in no-nonsense terms that &quot;Denuvo is no longer in Payday 3&quot;.

The update comes a few weeks after fans shared screenshots within the Payday subreddit that intimated Payday 3 would feature the controversial anti-piracy software. Two months later, however, the Steam storefront has been updated, and Denuvo is no longer listed (thanks, PC Gamer).

In a note posted to X/Twitter, the studio said it had identified and removed &quot;2000+&quot; cheaters and reminded players to &quot;report any suspicious player activity through [its] in-game tools&quot;.

                              <span>Tired of that giant white slab of a PlayStation 5 in your living room and looking to add a bit of pizzazz to your surroundings? Well then Sony might just, depending on your idea of tasteful, have what you&#x27;re looking for: three new metallic console covers (and matching controllers) that are almost certainly not going to match your existing decor!


Sony&#x27;s newly announced Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, and Sterling Silver cover/controller combos are, according to a post on the PlayStation Blog, inspired by the &quot;beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth&quot; - all of which have then bee &quot;elevated&quot; with a metallic finish for a &quot;touch of sophistication.&quot;


Those interested in giving their PS5 a &quot;Deep Earth&quot; makeover can, when the appropriate time comes, pick up each of the three shiny new covers for £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers (sold separately) will each cost £64.99/€74.99/$74.99 USD.

                              <span>Frictional Games fans could be forgiven for thinking the horror-focused studio has been getting a little soft in recent years, having introduced death-free and monster-free modes in post-launch updates for its acclaimed SOMA and Amnesia: Rebirth. This year, though, it&#x27;s going in completely the opposite direction, and its recently launched WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker will be getting even more nerve-frayingly horrifying, just in time for Halloween.


As spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun, Frictional&#x27;s creative lead Fredrik Olsson has recently been using social media to detail some of the delightfully sadistic new features coming to Amnesia: The Bunker soon in what will known as Shell Shocked mode.


For starters, players who&#x27;ve been relying on the comparative tranquility of The Bunker&#x27;s Admin Office safe room to emotionally, physically, and mentally regroup will, in Shell Shocked mode, be a little bit screwed. Now, its reassuringly sturdy steel doors will be replaced wood, which, you know, isn&#x27;t all that resistant to scrambling, pounding, shredding monster claws.

                              <span>Ubisoft Montreal - the studio behind the likes of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Far Cry 5 - has been accused of leaving staff in &quot;turmoil&quot; after it reportedly reneged on promises that &quot;100% remote work would be possible&quot;, forcing all 4,000 of its workers back to the office for a &quot;minimum&quot; of two days a week, as of 11th September.


Back in June 2021, Ubisoft announced it would be adopting a &quot;hybrid and tailored approach to work arrangements&quot; where staff would be able &quot;to balance in-office work with work from home&quot;. However, according to a new report by IGN, Ubisoft Montreal staff were repeatedly told they could remain 100% remote long-term, leading many to make significant life decision or accept jobs at the company based around these assurances.


&quot;100% remote work will be possible depending on various criteria,&quot; reads an internal Ubisoft document seen by IGN and detailed in its report, &quot;such as productivity and impact on the team, as well as the nature of the work being done.&quot;

                              <span>American Truck Simulator trundles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has now confirmed its next stop (after the already announced but not-yet-released stops of Kansas and Nebraska, that is) will be the state of Arkansas.


This marks something of an interesting (I realise your mileage may vary on this point) deviation for SCS, which has so far been making its way across the US map in a bottom-to-top, left-to-right fashion, starting with California. This latest news means once Kansas and Nebraska are released, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Louisiana will be missing from the expected progression.


Arkansas, the so-called Natural State (mine is &quot;asleep&quot;), will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 16th state when it arrives at some currently undisclosed future point, and SCS Software&#x27;s rendition promises everything from &quot;stunning mountain vistas to towering forests&quot;.

A new release date trailer for the game was shown at last night&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, which included a shot of Cloud and Sephiroth together in battle. In a follow-up interview on the PlayStation Blog, creative director Tetsuya Nomura confirmed Sephiroth will be playable.


&quot;If you played the original Final Fantasy 7, I&#x27;m sure you can guess which scene I&#x27;m talking about,&quot; he said. &quot;You will be able to control Sephiroth in the same scene in this title as you did in the original.&quot;

                              <span>As revealed in PlayStation&#x27;s recent State of Play, Honaki: Star Rail is coming to PS5 on 11th October, 2023.


Developed by HoYoverse, the company behind Genshin Impact, Star Rail is an anime-styled turn-based RPG with a gacha system, and has already been in the hands of PC and mobile players for five months.


While Star Rail is a free download, you can purchase its PS5 &quot;pre-order&quot; bundle for £9.49 to get some in-game items when it releases, and the ability to pre-download the game on PS5. But these in-game items are fairly unhelpful in the grand scheme of getting and building characters, especially when compared to its battle pass, the &quot;Nameless Honor&quot;, which upgrades its free track to premium for £9.99 and offers far more helpful materials and weapons.

                              <span>Ascendant Studios, the developer behind the EA published Immortals of Aveum, has laid off almost half of its staff.


Ascendant CEO Bret Robbins shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating 45 percent of the team have been let go - a &quot;painfully difficult, but necessary decision that was not made lightly&quot;.


According to a report from Polygon, around 40 people were laid off, with one former employee claiming poor sales of Immortals of Aveum was a key reason.

                              <span>The wait is almost over (sort of)! Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth - the second instalment in Square Enix&#x27;s three-part Final Fantasy 7 remake - will be coming to PlayStation 5 on 29th February next year.


We&#x27;ve had a couple of glimpses of Rebirth since its announcement back in June 2022, and we know it&#x27;ll unsurprisingly be picking up the story from 2020&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 Remake and later InterMISSION DLC - although &quot;preparations&quot; are being made to help you catch up if you can&#x27;t be bothered to play through either of those beforehand.


&quot;After escaping from the dystopian city of Midgar,&quot; developer Square Enix explains, &quot;Cloud and his friends set out on a journey across the planet. New adventures await in a vibrant and vast world – sprint across grassy plains on a Chocobo and explore expansive environments.&quot;

                              <span>During this evening&#x27;s Sony State of Play, Insomniac Games revealed some more information about next month&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 ahead of its release on 20th October.

The game&#x27;s map has almost doubled in size, with the addition of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City. To help Peter and Miles swing across the larger map, they can now use web wings to traverse faster. The game uses a new fast travel system which is unlocked through the district progress systesm, and Insomniac says players will experience &quot;very little downtime&quot; when using fast travel.
The HUD for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 looks more organic, as markers for activities and quests players have already discovered will appear across New York City. This is explained in-game as AR technology in the lenses of the Spider-Masks which, given the technology already used by characters in the Spider-Man universe, Peter and Miles probably sorely need.

                              <span>Resident Evil 4&#x27;s Separate Ways campaign and Mercenaries mode update are coming to this year&#x27;s acclaimed Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC remake on 21st September - and the main game&#x27;s long-awaited VR mode will hit PSVR2 this &quot;winter&quot;.


Separate Ways, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was introduced to Resident Evil 4 when the game made the jump from GameCube to PlayStation 2 in 2005. It focuses on enigmatic spy Ada Wong, who briefly pops up in the Leon S. Kennedy-starring main campaign - filling in the blanks of her whereabouts over the course of the story.


A Resident Evil 4 Remake version of Separate Ways was first spotted by dataminer Gosetsu back in March, and Capcom has now made it official, confirming it&#x27;ll release for $9.99 USD - alongside a free update to Resident Evil 4&#x27;s wave-based Mercenaries mode introducing Ada Wong and Albert Wesker - on 21st September.

                              <span>Big times are coming for Cyberpunk 2077, with its paid expansion and a significant 2.0 base game overhaul both right around the corner; we already knew the expansion, Phantom Liberty, was coming on 26th September, but developer CD Projekt has now confirmed its free 2.0 update will arrive five days earlier, on 21st September.


Cyberpunk 2.0 aims to address some of the criticism levied at the game since its controversial launch at the tail-end of 2020, promising completely redesigned skill trees and perks, revamped cyberware, a new capacity system, vehicle combat and car chases, combat AI improvements, and a new police system. It also brings changes to loot, items, and crafting, as well as UI and UX improvements, and a new selection of radio stations.


In other words, Cyberpunk&#x27;s 2.0 update touches on a broad range of core systems in a significant fashion - and CD Projekt has been attempting to explain how these changes will impact the experience across a recent series of developer streams.

                              <span>Ready for more announcements? State of Play, Sony&#x27;s own version of the Nintendo Direct, returns tonight at 10pm UK time. If you&#x27;re over the pond that&#x27;s 5pm Eastern, or 2pm Pacific. 


Today&#x27;s State of Play is focused on &quot;previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles&quot;, including PlayStation VR2, Sony said yesterday - so don&#x27;t expect any big new reveals. Specifically, these will be for third-party games - so don&#x27;t plan for any of Sony&#x27;s own internal studios to pop up either. 


There&#x27;s still plenty that could feature, though - including Square Enix games such as Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth and also Foamstars. What are you hoping to see?

                              <span>In the wake of its hugely controversial engine pricing changes, Unity has closed a number of its offices over what it has called a &quot;potential threat&quot;.


News of the temporary closures first began circulating earlier today as Unity employees shared the news on social media. &quot;Hey y&#x27;all, just a reminder to think before you target Unity employees,&quot; senior XR product designer Javier Busto wrote. &quot;This morning we learned that law enforcement notified several Unity offices of credible threats.&quot;


Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier later elaborated on those initial reports, writing that a &quot;credible death threat&quot; had resulted in the closer of two Unity offices - in San Francisco and Austin, Texas - as well as the cancellation of a town hall meeting that would have seen Unity CEO John Riccitiello addressing staff following Tuesday&#x27;s widely lambasted pricing changes.

                              <span>A fresh report into Unity&#x27;s hugely-controversial decision to start charging developers when their games are downloaded has thrown fresh light on the situation.

MobileGamer sources say Unity has already offered some studios a 100% fee waiver - if they switch over to Unity&#x27;s own LevelPlay ad platform. 


The report quotes industry consultants that say this move is an &quot;attempt to destroy&quot; Unity&#x27;s main competitior in this field: AppLovin.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was one for the Nintendo faithful, with remakes and remasters from classic franchises aplenty - and a star turn for Princess Peach. 


The Direct&#x27;s line-up, including an F-Zero 99 announcement,  and big finale, a port of the beloved Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, were fan-pleasing additions to the Switch&#x27;s bulging catalogue.


And they are perhaps the kind of smaller announcements we&#x27;d expect at this point, for a platform widely-expected to be replaced next year. Still, as we saw, there&#x27;s plenty of life left for the next six months at least - and beyond?

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s previously announced Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 spruce-up - which it&#x27;s now officially calling Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD - is set to launch for Switch next &quot;summer&quot;.


A enhanced version of Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 (originally titled Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon when it launched for 3DS back in 2013) was initially unveiled in June, but today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct offered a substantially longer look at its spooky ghost-hoovering action.


The twist in Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the original, is that it plays out across not just one ghost-infested haunted dwelling, but five - starting with the kind of classic spook house seen in its GameCube predecessor, and continuing through the likes of a former research lab, run-down clock factory, snowy mine, and more.

Originally released in 2004, it continues the paper origami style of the first N64 game but with new abilities and an expansive story.

Another Code Recollection, as this new version is officially known, features a shiny new remake of Another Code: Two Memories (known as Trace Memory in the US), which launched for Nintendo DS back in 2005.


Here, players take on the role of 13-year old Ashley Mizuki Robbins as she searches for her father on the fictional Blood Edward Island - all with a little bit of help from her ghostly friend D.

                              <span>Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Nintendo&#x27;s infrequent platform-puzzle series, is making its way to Switch next February.


Based on its Nintendo Direct reveal, Mario vs. Donkey appears to be a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance original (Nintendo referred to this Switch release as an &#x27;updated&#x27; version), and will once again see Mario puzzling his way across various puzzle-based platform stages to rescue the mini-Marios.


The goal each level is to retrieve a key and get it to the exit, requiring both observation and brain work to navigate the obstacles using levers, platforms, and other wrinkles to grab the mini-Marios and progress to the next area.

                              <span>Developer Drop Bear Bytes has announced its post-apocalyptic RPG Broken Roads will be out on 14th November.

We got our first look at Broken Roads a couple of years ago, when it was aiming for a 2022 release. The game&#x27;s launch was pushed back a year, during which Drop Bear Bytes partnered with publisher Versus Evil.

Inspired by classic single-player CRPGs, Broken Roads follows a group of companions as they make their way across a post-apocalyptic imagining of Australia.

The Pokémon Company released The Teal Mask yesterday, which will be followed by The Indigo Disk. Collectively they&#x27;re known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.


However, just as with the base games, players are already discovering a myriad of issues, some of which seem eerily familiar.

Mega Crit pledged to ditch Unity as the engine for its next game - a project it has already poured two years of work into - if Unity does not back down over its hugely unpopular decision.


&quot;Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into the development on our new title,&quot; Mega Crit wrote on X, formerly Twitter, &quot;we will be migrating to a new engine unless the changes are completely reverted and TOS [Terms of Service] protections are put in place.

Asmussen, whose career in the games industry spans close to 25 years, worked on all three original God of War titles at Santa Monica Studio prior to his move to Respawn - serving as lead environment artist, then art director, and, finally, creative director on God of War 3. 


He joined Respawn Entertainment as a game director in 2014, and his first released project at the studio was 2019&#x27;s well-received Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. A follow-up, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, also helmed by Asmussen, released earlier this year, proving to be a commercial hit.

Sony hasn&#x27;t yet indicated how long this latest broadcast is likely to last, but things kick off at 10pm tomorrow in the UK/11pm CEST/2pm PT/5pm ET.


Anyone hoping for some juicy first-party news - or even another quick look at Spider-Man 2: Spider-Mens - should temper their expectations. &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s broadcast will focus on updates to previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles,&quot; says the PlayStation Blog.

Proceedings get underway at 6pm in the UK/1pm EDT, and viewers can expect around an hour of chat - which will include &quot;on-the-horizon news and updates&quot; - covering both Minecraft and this year&#x27;s action-strategy spin-off, Minecraft: Legends.


As for this year&#x27;s community mob vote (mobs, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Minecraft parlance, are basically enemies), it&#x27;ll offer a choice between three new mobs - which Mojang will reveal at the &quot;beginning of October&quot; - and take place via the Minecraft Launcher, Minecraft.net, or the special event server on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

An app with the name Signal Plus Messenger was available on Play for nine months and had been downloaded from Play roughly 100 times before Google took it down last April after being tipped off by security firm ESET. It was also available in the Samsung app store and on signalplus[.]org, a dedicated website mimicking the official Signal.org. An app calling itself FlyGram, meanwhile, was created by the same threat actor and was available through the same three channels. Google removed it from Play in 2021. Both apps remain available in the Samsung store...</span>

As detailed on Bethesda&#x27;s website, the studio is initially targeting a &quot;few top issues&quot; in a small hotfix out today, after which it&#x27;ll be turning its attention to various community requested features, which will arrive in updates at a &quot;regular interval&quot;.


Specifically, it&#x27;s confirmed Nvidia DLSS Support on PC following its controversial partnership with AMD, as well as 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on the platform. Additionally, players can expect a range of quality of life improvements, including a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, plus brightness and contrast controls. Oh, and also, more convenient, efficient consumption through the power of a new &quot;Eat&quot; button for food.

                              <span>A new PS5 update will allow players to assign a second controller as an assist.


This is an accessibility feature to allow two controllers to be used at once, meaning players can help others by playing games collaboratively.


This is just one of a suite of features as part of this new update, which is available to download today globally. Another is the addition of support for larger-capacity SSDs  - now up to 8TB.

The company has subsequently softened its stance slightly on a couple of aspects - but fury across the industry remains.

Behind the scenes, CEO John Riccitiello shifted 2000 shares last week on 6th September, as noted by Yahoo Finance, which noted this move was part of a trend over the past year where the exec has sold more than 50,000 shares in total and bought none.

                              <span>Recent Square Enix games have misfired due to the approach of each game being &quot;a single producer&#x27;s fiefdom&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to a new report from Bloomberg, detailing a recent drop in stock value of the company compared to its closest rival Capcom, though stock over the past couple of years has fluctuated but appears relatively stable. It&#x27;s claimed this recent drop is due to underwhelming sales of Final Fantasy 16, though it also follows the disappointing Forspoken and a number of smaller games released at the tail-end of last year that failed to make much of an impression.


Bloomberg sources include current and former Square Enix employees who remain anonymous, but stated the company&#x27;s approach is to give each project a single producer.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s news that Unity will begin charging per game install, indie developers have taken to social media to make their fury heard.


Unity shared a blog post detailing plans of a new business model where a monthly fee per new game install will be set from 1st January next year. In a statement following the blog post, the game engine creator insisted the change will &quot;only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users&quot;.


However, a huge number of games are built using Unity tools, so the reaction to this change has been met with widespread criticism.

Unity told Axios last night it had &quot;regrouped&quot; to further discuss some of the issues raised by game developers, and made some concessions.


Initially, Unity planned to charge game developers a small fee every time a user installed a Unity game (beginning at the start of 2024, subject to the project meeting certain thresholds). Now, Unity said, this charge would only come after a user first installed a game.

Additionally, players who&#x27;ve been progressing through Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s overarching story will be able to settle The Forgotten into the Valley over a series of quests, and - good news for the completionists out their (hello, it&#x27;s me) - the spooky candy event is back from 24th October to 1st November, meaning you can tidy up any seasonal Dreamlight Duties you missed last year.

                              <span>EA has launched another of its Behind the Sims showcases at the internet, this one bringing confirmation that The Sims 5 - or codename Project Rene as it&#x27;s officially known at present - will indeed be a free-to-play game, as previously leaked, and will coexist alongside The Sims 4. Oh, and there was also some news on The Sims 4&#x27;s first Stuff Pack in over two-and-a-half years.


First, though, Project Rene and the news it&#x27;ll definitely be free-to-play - or as EA is more insistently phrasing it, &quot;free-to-download&quot;. Either way, the important thing here is that no core game purchase will be required, and EA is also keen to add there&#x27;ll be no subscription and no &quot;energy mechanics&quot; - so that&#x27;s at least one predatory mobile monetisation tactic off the table.


As to what a new mainline Sims game designed from the ground-up to be free-to-play might look like, a Project Rene job listing hastily removed from EA&#x27;s website earlier this year pointed to an in-game marketplace featuring official and user-generated content (both free and paid) - something else EA has now more or less confirmed.

                              <span>Apple has revealed its new iPhone 15 line-up, bringing the news that its ray-tracing-enabled iPhone 15 Pro will be getting native versions of some AAA titles - including Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil 4 Remake and Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage - over the next 12 months.


The newly unveiled iPhone 15 starts at £799 with 128GB storage, and features a 6.1&quot; Super Retina XDR display (bumped up to 6.7&quot; if you opt for the £899 &quot;Plus&quot; model), an aluminium body, the A16 Bionic Chip with 5-core GPU, and a 4x optical dual camera system capable of taking photos at up to 48MP. It&#x27;ll also ditch Apple&#x27;s proprietary Lighting port in favour of USB-C to comply with upcoming EU regulations. 


The pricier iPhone 15 Pro model (starting at £999 with 128GB storage) is where things get a little more interesting for gaming. Its specs are broadly similar to the standard model (the £1,199 Pro Max even has the 6.7&quot; screen), but it switches in a 10x optical &quot;telephoto&quot; camera zoom, titanium body, and the A17 Pro chip with 6-core GPU.

                              <span>Unity has announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model which will see it introduce a monthly fee per new game install beginning on 1st January next year - a move that has drawn considerable criticism from the development community.


Unity - the engine behind countless acclaimed games including Tunic, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Citizen Sleeper, RimWorld, Outer Wilds, Fall Guys, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Cities: Skylines - was previously licenced to developers using a royalty free model built around subscription tiers. Anyone whose revenue or funding was less than $100k over the course of the year (and who didn&#x27;t want access to features such as the ability to remove the Unity splash screen) could stick to the free Unity Personal licence, while a Unity Plus subscription was required up to $200k in revenue, and a Unity Pro or above subscription was needed for more.


As of 1st January, 2024, however, developers will be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install - seemingly including re-installs and installs across multiple devices - on top of their existing licence subscription, with those fees kicking in for titles that have made $200k or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200k lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers, meanwhile, will see the fees applied after passing the $1m revenue and 1m lifetime installs threshold.

Citizen Lab says two zero-days fixed by Apple today in emergency security updates were actively abused as part of a zero-click exploit chain (dubbed BLASTPASS) to deploy NSO Group’s Pegasus commercial spyware onto fully patched iPhones.
The two bugs, tracked as CVE-2023-41064 and CVE-2023-41061, allowed the attackers to infect a fully-patched iPhone running iOS 16.6 and belonging to a Washington DC-based civil society organization via PassKit attachments containing malicious images.
“We refer to the exploit chain as BLASTPASS. The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim,” Citizen Lab ...</span>

Kubernetes v1.25 introduced support for user namespaces for only stateless
pods. Kubernetes 1.28 lifted that restriction, after some design changes were
done in 1.27.
The beauty of this feature is that:
it is trivial to adopt (you just need to set a bool in the pod spec)
doesn&#x27;t need any changes for most applications
improves security by drastically enhancing the isolation of containers and
mitigating CVEs rated HIGH and CRITICAL.
This post explains the basics of user namespaces and also shows:
the changes that arrived in the recent Kubernetes v1.28 release
a demo of a vulnerability rated as HIGH that is not exploitable with user namespaces

Whilst the front shell is a deep purple, the back is white (similar to the design of Velocity Green which was released earlier this year). 
This is your standard Xbox controller, and has all the features you&#x27;d expect including textured bumpers and triggers, a dedicated Share button, and 3.5mm jack.

                              <span>NBA 2K24 is the second-worst reviewed game on Steam following a hugely negative reaction from fans to the PC version.


Released last week, NBA 2K24 is the latest in 2K&#x27;s long-running basketball series and was launched across all major platforms.


However, a backlash from PC players has resulted in an influx of negative reviews. Now, according to Steam 250, it ranks just behind Overwatch 2 in the list of worst reviewed games on Steam.

More information on what fans can expect is &quot;coming soon&quot;, as stated in the announcements from The Pokémon Company, though the teaser video for the event has some glimpses of what we might see. 
Pikachu and Eevee are shown running through a field of sunflowers, against a backdrop of countryside and windmills, before the animation transforms into the art style of an oil painting with Vincent Van Gogh&#x27;s signature brush strokes. Pikachu and Eevee turn to see the sunflowers have all turned into beaming Sunflora, and then we get a quick look at Van Gogh&#x27;s famous Sunflowers painting but with Sunflora taking centre stage.

A limited run physical edition will then launch in Europe just over a week later, on 23rd October, with some extra cosmetic packs and a physical map included. I do like physical maps!


Anyone who pre-orders gets an early access weekend from Friday 29th September to Monday 2nd October and yet more extra cosmetic bits and bobs.

The games have been unavailable for purchase since March this year, when the 3DS (and Wii U) eShop closed.
As reported by Nintendo Life, developer Jupiter has announced the first game in the Picross e series will be released at some point next year under the name Picross S+.

                              <span>Since its release, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has gained praise for its execution of D&amp;D systems and the freedom allowed to players in roleplaying. And, like a reluctant DM, the game will warn you if you&#x27;re about to do something very silly, before watching you do the very silly thing and then say &quot;I warned you&quot;.
In Act 3, there are some important items required for the main storyline. You&#x27;re not supposed to get rid of these and there are some restrictions in place to prevent players from losing one of them, but as BOB_BestOfBugs on YouTube has discovered, that won&#x27;t stop a resourceful D&amp;D player. 
Warning: This article contains story spoilers for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, so turn back now to avoid those. Perhaps you&#x27;d prefer to read our combat tips guide or check out Digital Foundry&#x27;s impressions of the game on PS5 instead!

In particular, a screenshot of Times Square features sharper lighting and increased traffic density.

Luckily, one of the game&#x27;s more frustrating bugs - suddenly being unable to fire weapons - has a rather simple fix. All you need do is enter the game&#x27;s character customisation screen.
Players have been reporting this &quot;can&#x27;t shoot&quot; issue on reddit and Steam since Starfield was available in early access.

                              <span>XDefiant, the Tom-Clancy-adjacent free-to-play shooter from Ubisoft, has been delayed out of its previously planned summer window, with the publisher blaming certification issues on Xbox and PlayStation for the game&#x27;s slip into what&#x27;s now &quot;likely&quot; to be an October release.


XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division initially announced as Tom Clancy&#x27;s XDefiant back in 2021 before dropping its prefix - has had a number of closed Insider tests and open sessions throughout its development and was expected to get its full launch for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC some time this summer.


However, writing in a post on Ubisoft&#x27;s website, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin explained the game&#x27;s continuing lack of a release date can largely be blamed on complication arising during Microsoft and Sony&#x27;s certification processes for their respective consoles.

                              <span>Last time you got up from playing Xbox in your Xbox-branded onesie to grab yourself some food made with your Xbox-branded cookbook from your Xbox-branded mini-fridge, did you by any chance say to yourself, &quot;Gee, I really wish I&#x27;d been able to buy all this Xbox tat with an Xbox-branded credit card&quot;? Well, guess what? Anything is possible in this darkest of timelines.


The official Xbox credit card will soon be a thing, albeit only in the US for the time being, having been conjured into existence through a partnership between Microsoft and Mastercard. It&#x27;ll initially be available exclusively to Xbox Insiders (it&#x27;s expected to expand to all US-based Xbox players starting next year) and offers one of those reward-based scheme things, which - and I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a nicer way of putting this - essentially incentivises people to increase their debt, so, you know, please use responsibly and all that.


Basically, everyday purchases made on the card will steadily accrue points that can be spent on games and add-ons via Xbox.com, but an initial purchase using the card will also reward cardholders with 5,000 points (equating to $50 USD), plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Only new members are eligible for that three-month deal, incidentally, but it can be gifted to other people if you&#x27;re already a Game Pass subscriber yourself.

&quot;The base case is that Gearbox remains a part of Embracer,&quot; Gearbox chief communications officer Dan Hewitt told staff in an email seen by Bloomberg. &quot;However, there are many options under consideration, including Gearbox&#x27;s transfer, taking Gearbox independent, and others. Ultimately, we&#x27;ll move ahead with whichever path is best for both Gearbox and Embracer.&quot;


&quot;Nothing has been decided yet,&quot; Hewitt added, &quot;but there will be a lot of speculation in the coming weeks.&quot;

Sony announced a limited edition bundle for the upcoming Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, which includes a custom PS5 cover. The cover features black tendrils on a red background to represent the battle between Venom and Spider-Man, complete with a white spidey logo in the corner.

Dbrand&#x27;s version is aptly called Arachnoplates and is a close copy of Sony&#x27;s design, albeit with more intricate webbing in the design and no spiders in sight.

Patch 1.02 is now available to download across PC and consoles and makes some balance adjustments and bug fixes, typical of these sorts of updates. 


What&#x27;s more interesting, though, are adjustments to certain attacks by three bosses: Balteus, Sea Spider, and CEL240.

Black Flag&#x27;s disappearance from the Steam store prompted speculation from fans - fuelled by previous whispers - that Ubisoft had pulled the original version of the game ahead of the launch of its rumoured remake.


In response to those whispers, Ubisoft has now issued a statement saying the game was simply unavailable to buy right now due to a &quot;technical issue&quot;.

Foolish Mortals is a &quot;merry and macabre&quot; Monkey Island-inspired adventure that takes place on the exotic locale of Devil&#x27;s Rock. Players take on the role of Murphy McCallan, as he seeks the treasure of Bellemore Manor. Of course, it won&#x27;t be easy, and McCallan will come across ghosts, voodoo and more during his adventures. 


Originally slated to release this year, creator David Younger of Inklingwood Studios shared news of the delay as part of a recent blog update. Here, Younger also teased some improvements coming to the game&#x27;s final release.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s space behemoth Starfield has now reached another new milestone in Steam concurrent players.


Over the weekend, following the game&#x27;s full release, it hit a peak of 330,723 concurrent players.


That&#x27;s bigger than Skyrim&#x27;s 287,411 concurrent player record, though still a way behind Fallout 4, which has a concurrent Steam player count of 472,962.

After that date, the game will remain playable - and simply recycle content already in the game.


Mario Kart Tour originally launched for iPhone and Android devices four years ago, back in September 2019, and soon became one of Nintendo&#x27;s most lucrative mobile launches.

                              <span>The robot revolution began long ago, and so did the killing. One day in 1979, a robot at a Ford Motor Company casting plant malfunctioned—human workers determined that it was not going fast enough. And so twenty-five-year-old Robert Williams was asked to climb into a storage rack to help move things along. The one-ton robot continued to work silently, smashing into Williams’s head and instantly killing him. This was reportedly the first incident in which a robot killed a human; many more would follow.

The news comes via Window Central&#x27;s Jez Corden, who&#x27;s heard rumours that BioWare plans to &quot;ditch open world and go back to [the franchise&#x27;s] classic format&quot;.

Corden made the claim in the latest edition of his podcast, The Xbox Two Podcast, in a broader conversation about the pros of established studios sticking to the development blueprint that made their games so special versus the cons of taking risks and innovating, only for it to instantly crash and burn.

                              <span>Thinking about jumping into Starfield but worried about the levelling up grind? This player has a top tip for you.

YouTuber Maka91Productions has released a full guide about their clever way to maximise your XP. Admittedly, you won&#x27;t be able to get to it immediately – you&#x27;ll need some skill points and the Outpost Engineering skill to set it up, as well as be pretty comfortable with the game&#x27;s mechanics – but once you&#x27;ve a few hours under your belt, make sure you research power generation and resource extractors at a Research Laboratory.

How you configure your ship is just as important, too. As The Loadout notes, you should ensure your ship can carry 2000-3000 cargo space, and then make a beeline for these resources: Adaptive Frames (18), Aluminum (124), 2Beryllium (24), Copper (30), Fiber (2), Iron (99), and Tungsten (24) from Jemison Mercantile and the store on ship.

                              <span>Surprise! It looks like Gotham Knights is coming to Nintendo Switch.

Until now, the game has only been playable on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, but according to an update to the North American ratings board the ESRB, it looks like the action-RPG will shortly be making an appearance on Nintendo Switch, too.

As spotted by the eagle-eyed folks on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, nothing else about the rating listing has changed beyond the sneaky addition of &quot;Nintendo Switch&quot; to the platform list.

                              <span>A fire has destroyed part of the offices of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World.

As reported by Vortex (thanks, @HazzadorGamin), the fire broke out at the team&#x27;s Prague office on Thursday and while, thankfully, no one was injured, the fire has devastated one of the three floors the studio uses, and now requires &quot;complete reconstruction&quot;.

&quot;Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition&quot; popped up on the IMDA&#x27;s website, having been approved for a &quot;M18&quot; – that&#x27;s a mature 18 – given its &quot;sexual references&quot;. The bundle includes both the base game and its expansion, Burning Shores.

&quot;Set on post-apocalyptic Earth, the protagonist, Aloy, travels to the west to discover the source of a mysterious signal and to find a way to restore Earth,&quot; the extended classification information explains (thanks, TryHard).

Blain – an established games journalist and horror specialist who formerly hosted the excellent Sound of Gaming podcast on BBC Sounds – joins president Zach Wood and CFO Don Sechler to help identify and vet potential partners and game ideas, as well as ensure the studio &quot;delivers unique and creative horror game experiences&quot;.

&quot;Louise brings an encyclopedic knowledge of horror across all media, particularly in video games,&quot; said Blumhouse Games president Zach Wood (thanks, Deadline). &quot;Her creative lens and prior experience in genre perfectly aligns with our goal of delivering unique and creative horror game experiences to our audience.&quot;

Developer Ironmace took to social media earlier this week to report that it was &quot;deploying servers with extra DDoS protection&quot;, taking the game offline for several hours to undertake emergency maintenance. 

But even after bringing the servers back up, players continued to report issues logging in, and Ironmace was still battling the denial of service attacks the following day.

Whilst Vincke has been incredibly taciturn about the possibility of additional Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 content - not least because Larian is currently occupied developing another title as well as managing Baldur Gate&#x27;s 3 post-launch activities and console ports – he did acknowledge that he&#x27;d been thinking about how DLC could complement Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, going so far as to hint that it didn&#x27;t even have to be constrained to an &quot;end-game&quot; event. 

In an interview with Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#x27; Todd Kenreck (embedded below), Vincke said that the idea of appending DLC could be &quot;very hard&quot; for the team, but conceded that it was &quot;not undoable&quot;.

                              <span>Donald Mustard, Fortnite boss and chief creative officer at Epic Games, has announced his retirement after 25 years in the games industry.


Mustard rose to prominence at Shadow Complex and Infinity Blade developer Chair Entertainment, a studio he co-founded in 2005. Chair was acquired by Epic Games in 2008 and Mustard would eventually become the company&#x27;s chief creative officer in 2016 - where he would oversee the meteoric rise of global video game phenomenon Fortnite.


Now, though, Mustard has announced his decision to move on from the company in a statement shared on social media, writing &quot;After an incredible adventure, I will be retiring from my role as chief creative officer at Epic this month.&quot;

                              <span>Saturnalia, the acclaimed survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is shaking off the shackles of Epic Games Store exclusivity and coming to Steam this October - and ahead of its launch, a 40-minute demo is now available on Valve&#x27;s platform.


Saturnalia - which Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin called a &quot;horrible nightmare in all the right ways&quot; in his Recommended review last year - whisks players away to the ancient, ever-shifting village of Gravoi, for an adventure heavily inspired by Sardinia folklore.


The goal here is to solve the mystery of the village and escape its confines, exploring and avoiding its horrors along the way. To aid in that atttempt, players can switch between four different characters at will, but should all of them die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

                              <span>Game creation platform Roblox will belatedly launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5 in October. 


The hugely-popular title arrived for Xbox in 2015, following earlier releases on PC, iPhone and Android. A PlayStation launch has taken far longer to materialise, however, reportedly due to concerns from Sony&#x27;s Jim Ryan around the game&#x27;s popularity with children.


Comments made by Ryan in 2022 - surfaced this year as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial - stated that PlayStation had historically been cautious around Roblox due to its millions of young users and &quot;anything that could potentially exploit them&quot;. However, Ryan also signalled a thawing of the company&#x27;s attitude to the game, noting that he had a &quot;hope&quot; the situation would change.

                              <span>Underground Blossom, the latest instalment in developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s surreal puzzle saga, has a release date: it&#x27;ll be careening through the tunnels of time and rolling into a distinctly Steam-shaped station on Wednesday, 27th September.


The Rusty Lake games, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, meld casual point-and-click puzzling with room-escape-style conundrums to tell a deliciously weird, loosely interconnected tale orbiting (to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the title) the lives of the Vanderboom family. The series generally falls into two camps; shorter, free-to-play offerings under the Cube Escape banner, and longer premium offerings that tend to be more substantial and more creatively ambitious.


Underground Blossom - which follows last year&#x27;s wonderfully inventive co-operative puzzler The Past Within - falls into the latter camp, this time taking players on a journey, via the Rusty Lake underground system, through the life and memories of Laura Vanderboom, who was introduced all the way back in the series&#x27; first outing, Cube Escape: Seasons.

                              <span>RuneScape developer Jagex is removing controversial pay-to-win aspects of its recently launched Hero Pass following an outcry from the game&#x27;s community.


At the start of the week, the Hero Pass was added to the MMORPG, which Jagex previously described as an &quot;always-on reward system&quot;. However, the reaction from players was overwhelmingly negative, in particular for pay-to-win options like purchasing Underworld Emblems or levels in the Hero Pass. This is in addition to other changes around content buffs and the Daily Challenge system.



Jagex yesterday released an update promising change. However the severity of player feedback meant the developer has now swiftly released another update, admitting: &quot;We messed up&quot;.

                              <span>Starfield officially launched out of early access on Wednesday, and so far, it seems to be the most bug-free game Bethesda has released. 


That being said, some little glitches have managed to slip through the cracks, and while there have been a few reports of crashes, most of these slips are actually really rather funny. 


So, as it is Friday, here is a little collection of amusing ways Starfield has star-failed, to put a smile on your face ahead of the weekend.

                              <span>Bethesda has discussed its decision not to include ground vehicles in Starfield - at least, not at the game&#x27;s launch.


Touch down on one of Starfield&#x27;s many planets and there are miles of planet to explore in each direction. But you&#x27;ll be doing this on foot, aided by your trusty jetpack. You can&#x27;t slide into a waiting dune buggy or landspeeder and jet across the Jundland Wastes, Luke Skywalker style.


This is by design, Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard has said, as it makes for a more authored experience.

                              <span>Starfield players are already having a lot of fun designing ships, but one player has managed to create the ultimate ship. It&#x27;s just ugly as hell.


As redditor Morfalath discovered, the AI in the game always aims for the middle of the player ship. The solution? Miss out the middle.


That&#x27;s why Morfalath created a ship that&#x27;s all corners and &quot;unbeatable&quot;.

                              <span>More than six million people have now played Starfield, developer Bethesda has said. 


That makes Starfield the &quot;biggest Bethesda game launch of all time&quot;, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter.


The suggestion is that a Bethesda game has never hit six million players in so quick a timeframe. On the one hand, it has done so with the help of Xbox Game Pass. On the other, it has done so without the PlayStation audience.

                              <span>Do you remember 1995&#x27;s 16-bit Disney platformer Gargoyles? Because I certainly don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m nearly as old as an actual gargoyle. But for those that do, and that hold the game (and indeed the cartoon it was based on) in high regard, Disney has confirmed its previously announced remaster will be coming to PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on 19th October.


Of course, if you&#x27;re not someone with fond memories for Gargoyles, that might be because it only ever officially released in North America, slapping onto the Sega Genesis (AKA the Mega Drive everywhere else) around the middle of the cartoon&#x27;s run. Wikipedia also tells me the well-received game was originally planned to release on Super Nintendo, before getting the chop.


Anyway, 28 years later, Gargoyles the game is returning in the form of Gargoyles Remastered, by Empty Clip Studios, featuring the ability to toggle between the original&#x27;s wonderfully characterful 16-bit visuals and a new art style said to be inspired by the cartoon, but which, to my eyes at least, doesn&#x27;t look to have anywhere near the same kind of charm.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 is gearing up to be a bit of a celebrity fest - what with the likes of JK Simmons, John Cena, and Megan Fox all putting in an appearance - but perhaps its most perfect addition is 80s action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, cameoing as Johnny Cage, whose in-game likeness has now debuted online courtesy of series co-creator Ed Boon and a bunch of chicken wings.


Boon, in an interesting marketing nuzzle-up, has appeared in the latest episode of First We Feast&#x27;s Hot Ones, in which famous folk attempt to gorge themselves on chicken wings dipped in an increasingly fiery selection of hot sauces without the tops of their heads flying off.


Boon&#x27;s 14-minute appearance includes (alongside some sweating and surprised mouth sounds) some breezy chatter about Mortal Kombat 1 and the history of the series, interspersed with bits of gameplay footage. Some of that takes the form of a brief - and by brief I mean barely five-seconds-long - in-game look at Van Damme, who appears around the 5:52 mark. To summarise, he pumps the air, flips the bird, and looks reasonably like a young Jean-Claude Van Damme.

                              <span>Back in June, reports began circlating that Google, fresh off its Stadia streaming flop, was looking to incorporate playable online games into YouTube. Well, we can now sling those reports onto the &#x27;correct&#x27; pile; testing for the tech giant new feature is officially underway.


The gist of Google&#x27;s new initiative, known as Playables, is that it&#x27;ll enable users to instantly play online games via YouTube&#x27;s website or iOS and Android apps - and now, as confirmed on its YouTube test features and experiments list (thanks 9to5google) testing is now live.


&quot;Playables are games that can be played directly on YouTube on both desktop and mobile devices,&quot; the company explains. &quot;If you&#x27;re part of this experiment, you&#x27;ll see a section on YouTube called &#x27;Playables&#x27; that will appear alongside other content on the home feed.&quot;

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss today&#x27;s report by Eurogamer that Nintendo is showing Switch 2 tech demos to developers, including at Gamescom last month. The new hardware from the Big N now feels closer than ever - but when exactly will it arrive?

More importantly, perhaps - for any Nintendo console - is what Nintendo game will it launch alongside? Will Switch 2&#x27;s beefier specs be a smart time to finally launch Metroid Prime 4? Or does Nintendo go with the more mass market approach, and tap up its 3D Mario team? 
Finally, since it&#x27;s out and it&#x27;s probably going to be the biggest game of the year, we discuss the opening moments of Starfield - beyond the hour we all spend in the character creator. Joining me this week to share their thoughts on all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Shigeru Miyamoto has shed more light on Charles Martinet&#x27;s new role as a Mario Ambassador. 


Last month, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, will no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo&#x27;s most recognisable mascot, after almost 30 years in the job. Instead, new voice talent will take over this role, starting with the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder later this year. Martinet, meanwhile, was announced to be starting a new position as a Mario Ambassador. 


Now, in a new video message, both Miyamoto and Martinet have shared more on this new role.

Reedpop, the owner of events such as PAX, EGX and websites such as Eurogamer.net, has now said it will not work on future iterations of E3, after previously partnering with the ESA to relaunch the show this year.

The ESA has also informed the Los Angeles Convention Centre, E3&#x27;s long-held home, it will not turn up there in 2024 - following an earlier report which stated the LA City Tourism Department did not expect the show to run there for the forseeable future.

The move comes after the Manchester United player&#x27;s recent loan to Spanish side Getafe, where he will play this season.


Greenwood was removed from Football Manager, EA Sports&#x27; FIFA and Konami&#x27;s eFootball after his arrest by police in January 2022 on suspicion of rape and assault. He was subsequently charged in October 2022 with attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour.

                              <span>Megan Fox is lending her voice and likeness to vampire Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. 


Last night, NetherRealm announced Nitara will return to the series as a playable character for the first time in almost 20 years. In a new video showcasing the blood-thirsty fighter, Fox said the character resonated with her, perhaps acknowledging her own penchant for a few drops of the red stuff. 


Nitara is &quot;evil but also good,&quot; Fox explained in the video, adding that she is &quot;trying to save her people&quot;. Fox said she had a lot of fun bringing her talents to Mortal Kombat 1, calling the series a &quot;staple&quot; on the gaming landscape. &quot;We did all grow up playing the game... it is one of the greatest video games of all time&quot;.

Developer presentations for Switch 2 took place behind closed doors, Eurogamer understands, with partners shown tech demos of how well the system is designed to run. 

One Switch 2 demo is a souped up version of Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, designed to hit the Switch 2&#x27;s beefier target specs. (To be clear, though - this is just a tech demo. There&#x27;s no suggestion the game will be re-released.)

Xbox boss Phil Spencer shared the news on X (formerly Twitter), adding: &quot;Thanks to all the players who helped us reach this great milestone and congrats to Bethesda Studios.&quot;


The game had already got off to an impressive start last week when it was released into early access for purchasers of the premium edition.

                              <span>Pikmin 4 is far from a difficult game. There&#x27;s no time limit you need to worry about, most resources can be perpetually collected, and the game is extremely forgiving about your ever-growing Pikmin death toll.


It&#x27;s easy enough to see Pikmin 4&#x27;s story properly to the end, with the toughest challenges being its platinum badges for Dandori side-missions. (It can be particularly tough with some of the Dandori battles against the AI, and especially tricky in that one, very long cave.


Tom is going through and collecting all of the platinum badges, to which I say godspeed, but ever since I finished Pikmin 4 I&#x27;ve been thinking about other ways I could challenge myself in the game. At time of writing, the speedrunning record for getting Pikmin 4&#x27;s true ending is just under two and a half hours, but it doesn&#x27;t take advantage of any area skips - it&#x27;s an exercise in Dandori mastery because there aren&#x27;t really any major glitches to take advantage of to begin with.

                              <span>Valve&#x27;s never-ending tinkering with Steam will soon see support for PlayStation&#x27;s DualSense and DualShock controllers bought to the fore, their compatibility set to be clearly listed on store and library pages starting this October.


That&#x27;s according to a developer-focused blog post revealing, among other things, that of the 87m Steam users who&#x27;ve played a game using a controller at least once, around 27 percent of those - up from 11 percent in 2018 - 
utilise either PS4&#x27;s DualShock or PS5&#x27;s DualSense.


To cater for these users, developers are now being asked to complete a questionnaire that&#x27;ll automatically rate a game&#x27;s DualShock/Sense compatibility based on the answers given.  Players can expect the results of these questions to clearly manifest as store-page guidance.

                              <span>All eyes might currently be on BigOl&#x27;Spacegame, but there&#x27;s plenty more happening behind-the-scenes at Bethesda, one of those things obviously being MachineGames&#x27; Indiana Jones project - which, depending how you choose to interpret four words from Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard, might just be gearing up for a proper reveal next year.


Bethesda announced it had an Indiana Jones game in the works - with Wolfenstein studio MachineGames at the helm - all the way back in January 2021, warning, &quot;It&#x27;ll be some time before we have more to reveal.&quot; And, true to its word, the project has remained shrouded in secrecy since - although we do at least now have confirmation, thanks to an FTC hearing testimony from Bethesda&#x27;s Pete Hines, that it&#x27;ll be releasing exclusively on Xbox and PC.


So with Bethesda&#x27;s Indy announcement steadily approaching its third anniversary, a persistent question has been, &quot;When will we see more?&quot;, and Todd Howard has now maybe teased - in an interview with Esquire - that the project will be getting a proper reveal sometime next year.

                              <span>Developer Gunfire Games has confirmed it&#x27;s readying a new update for its celebrated (and million-selling) Souls-like shooter sequel Remnant 2, promising that more quality of life updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, and a &quot;potato mode&quot; will be with players &quot;soon&quot;.


That news comes via Remnant 2 principal designer Ben Cureton, who shared a list of the upcoming patch&#x27;s headline features on social media. The aforementioned &quot;potato mode&quot; is, alas, unlikely to fulfil all your wildest, possibily erotic potato-slaying fantasies, more likely being some under-the-hood changes Gunfire has made to push Remnant 2&#x27;s settings below those previously allowed - hopefully meaning improved performance on lower-spec PCs.


Performance improvements have, of course, been a focus for Gunfire following Remnant 2&#x27;s slightly wobbly launch, and Cureton&#x27;s post makes it explicitly clear the incoming patch will include more. That comes alongside the introduction of toggle aim and hold sprint, &quot;dozens&quot; of enemy updates, material refund changes for weapon deconstruction, PlayStation icon selection, and proper EXP rewards for instances where Summons make the kills.

This is the result of a secret weapon criminals are selling access to online that appears to tap into an especially powerful set of data: the target’s credit header. This is personal information that the credit bureaus Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion have on most adults in America via their credit cards. Through a complex web of agreements and purchases, that data trickles down from the credit bureaus to other companies who offer it to debt collectors, insurance companies, and law enforcement...</span>

                              <span>With summer teetering on the precipice, threatening to tumble into a rainy, windswept autumn any day now, EA is wisely hedging its bets with its two newly announced The Sims 4 Kit packs - both arriving Thursday, 7th September - giving us sun, fun, and swimwear on one side, and resolutely indoor luxury living on the other.


The Sims 4&#x27;s Poolside Splash Kit, obviously enough, is all about appropriate attire for those lazy afternoons spent lounging with a margarita in one hand and a 700-page tome about the history of biscuits in the other (or, you know, whatever). That means the likes of shorts, trunks, vests, sandals, and bathing suits, sporting, as EA puts it, a &quot;plethora of patterns, colors and trendy cuts&quot; designed to compliment a variety of skin tones and body shapes.


Finishing touches come in the form of various aquatic accessories, including sunglasses, sandals, rainbow nails, floaties (including at least one rubber ring), and more.

                              <span>Jeff Gardiner, veteran RPG developer, said he&#x27;s &quot;thrilled, not threatened&quot; by the success of other RPGs like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.


Eurogamer spoke to the ex-Bethesda producer at Gamescom and discussed the current state of RPGs: why they&#x27;re so popular and how the success of Larian&#x27;s latest game was raising expectations of the genre.


&quot;I am thrilled, not threatened by great RPGs,&quot; said Gardiner, when asked about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. &quot;I love playing them. I would never be upset by this. I think it brings more people into the fanbase of RPGs. As an RPG creator and player I really believe in RPGs - I always have since I started playing them when I was a kid until now... I will celebrate their success, I&#x27;ll be their biggest fans forever. I am absolutely thrilled by it.&quot;

The latest games to be added are Quest for Camelot, Kirby&#x27;s Star Stacker, Joy Mech Fight and Downtown Nekketsu March Super-Awesome Field Day! across its Game Boy, SNES and NES libraries.

Admittedly, Kirby&#x27;s Star Stacker is the only game I&#x27;d previously heard of on this list, but Quest for Camelot has piqued my interest (for non-gaming related reasons).

                              <span>Having sex in Starfield will give you an XP boost.


For those looking to increase their XP, it looks like it would be worth setting yourself up for a romantic experience. 


As highlighted on the Starfield reddit (via VG247), players will get a 15 percent XP boost when they sleep with a companion. This little buff is called &quot;Emotional Security&quot;, and lasts for 24 minutes. It is similar but better than the 10 percent well-rested condition, which you can get by sleeping without a companion by your side.

Diablo boss Rod Fergusson confirmed Blizzard&#x27;s plan to launch &quot;quarterly seasons&quot; and &quot;annual expansions&quot; as part of Diablo 4&#x27;s ongoing live service.


Exactly how these expansions will be released, sold and priced is still unclear, however.

Sound familiar?

                              <span>James Bond will bring his espionage hijinks to Apple Arcade later this month. 


On 29th September, players will take on the role of a brand-new Bond in Cypher 007. This top-down mobile title comes from Tilting Point, and promises a return to some classic Bond locations, as well as the chance to relive some of the series&#x27; &quot;iconic moments&quot; from the past 60 years. 


This will, of course, mean Her Majesty&#x27;s best agent will also come face to face with several of his known-nemesis, such as Blofeld - along with Spectre - and Jaws. And, as every Bond fan knows, this means gadgets galore, including Little Nellie, Bond&#x27;s gyrocopter from You Only Live Twice.

                              <span>Cross-play is apparently already on the development roadmap for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. This means players on PlayStation 5 and PC - and at some point, Xbox - will all theoretically be able to play together online in the future.
Confirmation comes from Larian&#x27;s director of publishing, Michael Douse, who told me the studio always intended to do cross-play but it was one thing too many to get working for launch. The PS5 version comes out today, remember; the PC version came out at the beginning of August; and the Xbox versions will arrive at some point this year.
&quot;It was always in the planning,&quot; Douse told me, &quot;but we knew it wouldn&#x27;t be for launch. It&#x27;s in the roadmap, and though we have an idea of when we&#x27;d like to get it ready for, we don&#x27;t want to put a date on it until we&#x27;re sure.&quot;

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will not receive any additional content, Nintendo has said.


Nintendo&#x27;s legendary Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma confirmed the decision in an interview with Famitsu, where he said he&#x27;d simply &quot;done everything&quot; he could in Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s world.


Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi agreed, and said that while he was already thinking about what the &quot;next fun experience&quot; for the Zelda series should be, he did not know yet what form this may take.

                              <span>More Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 fixes have spilled forth from the depths of developer Larian Studios&#x27; ceaseless patch factory, this latest update - officially known as Hotfix #5 - remedying some previously acknowledged Minthara progression issues, as well as bringing a number of improvements specifically targeting the newly released PlayStation 5 version.


Starting with Minthara, Hotfix #5 aims to address some behind-the-scenes weirdness that was blocking certain lines of her dialogue, as well preventing player romances with the character from progressing in Act 3. There&#x27;d been some concern in the community, you might recall, that Minthara had been a victim of last-minute content cuts to meet Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s shifted deadline - but Larian had instead blamed her silence on a bug, promising an imminent fix, which, now here, should hopefully reinstate all missing Minthara content.


&quot;This hotfix takes care of a bug that blocked access to some of Minthara’s lines of dialogue, including some hot takes from your companions about your decision to date the ruthless Oath of Vengeance Paladin,&quot; Larian explains in today&#x27;s release notes. &quot;If approval is high enough, your romance with Minthara will progress in Act 3. This unlocks several new dialogues allowing you to explore and deepen the relationship, and discover more details of Minthara&#x27;s backstory. Alongside many lines of interactive dialogue, many more non-interactive voiced lines are available with Minthara as a romantic partner.&quot;

Those interested in gameplay streaming will first need to link their Discord account to their console, after which they can select the &#x27;Discord&#x27; option from &#x27;Parties &amp; chats&#x27; via the guide, pick a server, then directly share gameplay after jumping into a voice channel with friends.


Xbox voice reporting, meanwhile - another feature that made headlines on its Xbox Insiders debut - enables players to easily capture a 60-second video clip of an in-game voice incident they believe violates Xbox Community Standards then submit it as evidence for review.

Stray, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched last summer for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, depositing players in a dystopian sci-fi metropolis for some exploration, adventure, and a touch of mystery, as its four-legged protagonist searches for a way home.


News of Stray&#x27;s animated adaptation comes via Entertainment Weekly, and while specifics are limited at this seemingly early juncture, there&#x27;s a least a of hint at what Annapurna Animation will be trying to achieve in its own &quot;respectful&quot; adaptation.

                              <span>Following Payday 3&#x27;s  closed beta in August, developer Starbreeze has announced a three-day &quot;technical open beta&quot; for its co-op heist shooter  - running from this Friday, 8th September to Monday&#x27;s 11th September - ahead of this month&#x27;s full launch.


The goal, once again, is to stress test Payday 3&#x27;s servers ready for its 21st September arrival on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, only this time Starbreeze is throwing open the doors to anyone that fancies getting stuck in - as long as they&#x27;re on Xbox Series X/S or Steam.


As for what&#x27;ll be available this time around, it&#x27;s very much the same story as before; the Payday series&#x27; clown-masked original quartet - Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf - will all be playable, as will be the No Rest for the Wicked bank heist, which can be tackled either stealthily or guns a-blazing, depending on your own particular whims.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered why, when you&#x27;re having a lovely stroll around the world of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, there are so many bodies without heads lying around? No it&#x27;s not because the inhabitants of the world have faulty necks - it&#x27;s because developer Larian is doing something sneaky.
You see, offering people the ability to speak with any corpse via the spell Speak with Dead created a lot of work. It meant writers not only had to write lines for all the living people, but for the dead ones too. And okay, there&#x27;s a limiting factor in how Speak with Dead only allows you to ask five questions, but that&#x27;s still an array of questions to write answers for. And in a war-torn world filled with dead people... That&#x27;s a lot of answers to write.
What to do? Simple, albeit gruesome: cut their heads off. &quot;The trick that we use is [you can speak to] &#x27;any dead that still has their head&#x27;,&quot; Vincke told Wizards of the Coast interviewer Todd Kenreck, in a really lovely interview actually. &quot;So you will see a lot of decapitated people in the game - that&#x27;s literally how we solved that.&quot;

                              <span>There are now more Pokémon to collect in Pokémon Go than in any of the franchise&#x27;s main series games.


Today&#x27;s new Pokémon Go in-game event adds a menagerie of creatures from the franchise&#x27;s fictional Paldea region, featured in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, bringing the total number of species available in Pokémon Go up to a whopping 814.


That&#x27;s more than the record number of Pokémon available to use in any main series game, with the most being 809 in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.

                              <span>It turns out you can pinch one of Starfield&#x27;s better suits without picking locks. Not only that, you can actually get it quite near the start of the game.


There are a variety of suits in Starfield, obtained in various ways. Some you can buy from vendors, others can be found by exploration and looting. Your usual video game fare. However, if you are canny and take the time to place your cursor in just the right place, you can nab one of Starfield&#x27;s better suits as early as the second mission. 


The suit in question is the Mark 1 Spacesuit, which comes with the accompanying Helmet and Pack. It is all kept in a glass cabinet, under lock and key, in the basement of The Lodge. You can try to unlock this case in the traditional way, but unless you are a Master lock picker, you will be informed it is too difficult to do this right now.

                              <span>Respawn and EA have released another patch for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, this time with a focus on providing a &quot;solid 60fps&quot; for console Performance modes. 


Patch notes state players should now see a smoother performance when in this mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, over on PC, this Jedi: Survivor patch has introduced support for Nvidia DLSS, which the team said can &quot;massively improve performance&quot; for some users.


The patch also includes the usual bug fixes, such as fixing an issue where players could not retrieve XP if they died under a specific set of circumstances.

Solar Ash is the follow up to Hyper Light Drifter from developer Heart Machine, and turns the surreal dreamscape of that world into a 3D roguelike. It will be available on console, PC and cloud on 14th September.


That&#x27;s just after Starfield, Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s big space exclusive. It&#x27;s already available in early access for those who bought the premium edition; for everyone else it will hit Xbox Series X/S, PC and cloud on 6th September.

                              <span>The prominent (and at times controversial) developer Peter Molyneux has shed more light on his past interview appearances, saying he regrets the way he spoke back then.

Molyneux has become known for describing his games in interviews only for the end product to not live up to those words, something which he has repeatedly apologised for in the past, describing his behaviour as over-excitement and lies to stop bored journalists falling asleep. 

In the latest episode of the podcast My Perfect Console with Simon Parkin, Molyenux said the games he described in interviews were the product of a &quot;half-insane, creative mind&quot; designing games on the fly whilst trying to show passion for his work.

                              <span>Alone in the Dark, the reboot of the survival horror title from the 90s, will now launch in January. 


Developer Pieces Interactive said it is &quot;gracefully&quot; stepping away from the &quot;chaotic&quot; October release window, to &quot;avoid competing with the wake of Alan&#x27;s epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man&quot;.

The developer continued: &quot;Horror games thrive on the delicate balance of tension, exploiting our vulnerability and the eerie embrace of solitude. Envision yourself traversing a dimly lit house in the dead of night, where faint whispers and unidentifiable noises send shivers down your spine.

On the game&#x27;s subreddit, Poly Knight shared a video of the Mantis Lords boss fight recreated in full 3D (thanks TheGamer).


It&#x27;s a faithful recreation that proves what the 2D Metroidvania might look like as a 3D adventure.

The currently-unannounced edition has now cropped up via a pair of ratings board listings - first in August via the German USK ratings board, and now in the US via the ESRB.


Neither listing details any new feature headed to these fresh versions of Minecraft, but fans have high hopes that an Xbox Series X/S edition will finally include the game&#x27;s long-awaited ray-tracing option.

Yet thanks to modder Vawser and their EZ-Core mod on NexusMods, the game is a breeze (spotted by TheGamer).

                              <span>Mario Ambassador Charles Martinet is still unsure what his new role actually entails.


Last month, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, will no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo&#x27;s most recognisable mascot, after almost 30 years in the job.


Instead, it was announced, Martinet will now take on the role of a Mario Ambassador for the company. Nintendo said this new position will see the actor continuing to &quot;travel the world sharing the joy of Mario and interacting with you all!&quot; Other than that, it did not go into specifics on the job&#x27;s actual requirements.

                              <span>It looks like Sabotage Studio is working on DLC for its retro RPG Sea of Stars.


The company&#x27;s CEO Thierry Boulanger was recently interviewed on Canada Radio, where he explained the company is working on another game with the same development process it adopted for previous game The Messenger (thanks Kakuchopurei, GamesRadar).


Essentially that means the main development team will start work on the next game, while a smaller team will remain to work on DLC for Sea of Stars, just as it did with its ninja platformer.

                              <span>Ratatan, the spiritual successor to Sony Japan Studio&#x27;s beloved PlayStation Portable rhythm adventure Patapon, has wrapped up its Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, successfully amassing well over £1m - substantially above its £100,000 target - along the way.


Ratatan, if you&#x27;re unaware, is a collaboration between Ratata Arts, Tokyo Virtual Theory, and pH Studio, with Patapon creator Hiroyuki Kotani at the helm and original Patapon musician Kemmei Adach also returning. It&#x27;s described as roguelike blend of rhythm and side-scroller action in which players, either battling alone or with friends, build an army of 100 Cobun to take on foes as their march across the world of Redo continues.


Its crowdfunding campaign launched onto Kickstarter on 31st July, with the goal of raising ¥20,000,000 (approximately £109,000), but a little over a month later, it&#x27;s now wrapped up with ¥219,314,335 (around £1.2m) in the bank after contributions from 14,598 backers - apparently making it the  36th most funded video game Kickstarter of all time.

Shedding Light on CVSS Scoring Inconsistencies: A User-Centric Study on Evaluating Widespread Security Vulnerabilities
Abstract: The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a popular method for evaluating the severity of vulnerabilities in vulnerability management. In the evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts, their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the ”2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses” list. In a follow-up survey with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring...</span>

Q4 2024 means we&#x27;ll see season two debut sometime between October and December next year. As a reminder, the initial season dropped in November 2021 - making for a three-year gap between episodes.

Its concept is as you would expect, given the name of the game. You can move around your home, or surrounding area, and find Nintendo&#x27;s unassuming but rather lovely plant-animal hybrid creatures hiding away. 


Once found and plucked with a simple swipe up of the finger, these flower-topped friendlies then proceed to find treasure you never knew you had hidden in your house. It is all rather delightful.

Along with the game&#x27;s thorough character creator, which has already birthed the likes of Walter White from Breaking Bad and Tony Soprano, people have also been flexing their creative muscles on the ship front. 


Starting with perhaps one of the most famous sci-fi properties, here we have a selection of Star Wars-inspired ships. Of course, Han Solo&#x27;s Millennium Falcon has popped up several times since Starfield&#x27;s early access release.

                              <span>Starfield is still only out for early adopters, but already players are experimenting with the character creator. 


As with most Bethesda games, your journey into the stars begins with creating a custom character.


Many players have had fun creating some familiar faces from TV and film... and also Starfield creator Todd Howard.

                              <span>According to Bethesda, a lot is going to happen between now and 2330, when Starfield is set. Most obviously, if we follow the timeline setout by the developer, humans will be able to gallivant around in space and planet hop as casually as popping across The Channel for a quick visit to France. In fact, possibly even more casually than that. 


But, one thing that also apparently changes between now and 2330, is that dogs seem to go extinct. Or at least, labrador retrievers certainly do.


As shared by the prolific Can You Pet The Dog? social media account, it appears that man&#x27;s best friend is a thing of the past for those members of Constellation.

                              <span>Super Mario Bros. Wonder includes chatty flowers which share jokes and useful hints as you pass by - though Nintendo has now confirmed you can put them on mute if you&#x27;d prefer. 


However, even if you&#x27;d prefer to work the game&#x27;s secrets entirely for yourself, you can&#x27;t get rid of these flowers&#x27; hints completely.


Last week, fans spotted a note on Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese website which stated that you could pick between different options for the flowers&#x27; voice and speech bubbles, raising the possibility you could ignore them completely.

Relationships are a big part of the game&#x27;s appeal, but there&#x27;s no denying that companions come on a little too strong right from the off.


Speaking to TheGamer, game director Swen Vincke admitted that romances were bugged at the game&#x27;s launch and have since been tweaked.

According to Centro Leaks, &quot;the biggest source of Pokémon leaks, rumours, and news&quot;, the two new arrivals will join Munkidori, Okidogi, Fezandipiti, Ogerpon, Dipplin, and Poltchageist when the DLC launches on 13th September.

The Sinistcha &quot;pretends to be tea, trying to fool people into drinking it so it can drain their life-force&quot; – although the ruse is &quot;generally unsuccessful&quot; – and is thought to be from the same line as Poltchageist, as it looks like a Poltchageist, albeit with a different container.

In a candid post, Valve said that any main account found to be associated with a smurf – that is, an alternative account created by an experienced player just to farm XP and/or destroy lower-levelled players – could face &quot;a wide range of publishments&quot;, including permanent bans.

&quot;Today, we permanently banned 90,000 smurf accounts that have been active over the last few months,&quot; the team explained (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;Smurf accounts are alternate accounts used by players to avoid playing at the correct MMR, to abandon games, to cheat, to grief, or to otherwise be toxic without consequence.

u/Tidyckilla took to Starfield&#x27;s subreddit over the weekend to report their amazing escape, saying that if they hadn&#x27;t been awake &quot;bingeing&quot; the game when the fire broke out, the player and their wife would likely have &quot;died to smoke inhalation&quot;.

&quot;Starfield literally saved mine and my family’s life on 1st September,&quot; the player explained, appending a photograph of an apartment fire to his post.

That&#x27;s according to modder and reverse engineer Thethiny, who noticed that Steam has updated its Mortal Kombat 1 store listing to confirm that for those prepared to pay for the fancy edition, they&#x27;ll get playable character Shang Tsung and five days early access, starting from 14th September.  

Interestingly, the listing also reveals a little more about Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s microtransactions, too.

That&#x27;s according to producer/director Naoki Yoshida, who also confirmed at PAX West earlier today that as well as a new free update and quality-of-life improvements - including new control schemes - Final Fantasy 16 will also receive two paid DLC instalments, including one focusing on Valisthea. 

&quot;We are aware that many of you have been asking for a PC version&quot;, Yoshida said in a televised statement. &quot;So allow me to take this opportunity to officially announce that development on a PC version is currently underway.

Talking to Entertainment Weekly, Druckmann talked about how his &quot;job is really strange&quot; – &quot;I&#x27;m given feedback on this theme park thing, I&#x27;m working on the TV show, and I&#x27;m working on another game, so I&#x27;m just kind of jumping around on different projects&quot; – and, after confirming that the second season of HBO&#x27;s blockbuster The Last of Us series is &quot;outlined and ready to go as soon as the strike ends&quot;, was then asked about the highly-anticipated third The Last of Us game.

&quot;As far as the next game at Naughty Dog, I can&#x27;t say anything,&quot; he said. &quot;My comms director over there will slaughter me.&quot;

                              <span>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 will release in late 2024 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.

The game – which tells &quot;a vampire story set in modern Seattle reimagined for World of Darkness&quot; – is in development with celebrated indie studio, The Chinese Room.

As it&#x27;s still early days, we don&#x27;t yet have a gameplay trailer – although the teaser above gives us a flavour of what&#x27;s to come – but The Chinese Room says it&#x27;ll have gameplay to reveal in January 2024, and the game is expected to release in the fall/autumn that same year (that&#x27;s Q3 for our friends in the southern hemisphere).

The news came from Elianora themselves, who confirmed that they feigned surprise at each new teaser and press release because they&#x27;re secretly been working on the game at Bethesda all this time.

&quot;I have been deceiving you. I have been lying. I have been faking. I&#x27;ve kept secrets and pretended, &quot;Elianora teased in a recent Facebook update.

                              <span>Good news, Diablo fans – Diablo 4 is running a bonus XP/Gold event, Mother&#x27;s Blessing, to celebrate the (US - not for us in the UK, sadly) holiday weekend.

As Diablo&#x27;s official Xitter account puts it, &quot;only a fool refuses her bounty&quot;, which is a not-so-subtle hint to get stuck in and earn 25 per cent more XP and gold from now until 5th September. 

&quot;Rise, wanderer, and stand triumphant before your hoard of spoils,&quot; Blizzard says. &quot;An alluring glow descends across the land, increasing the clarity and temperament of all stalwart warriors. Scholars have unlocked new secrets in their ancient tomes, while coffers threaten to burst with gold unearthed from long-forgotten crypts.

                              <span>Horror master Supermassive Games has revealed that the reason Little Nightmares 3 only features online co-op is to ensure playing with a friend doesn&#x27;t detract from the horror game&#x27;s signature &quot;atmosphere and immersion&quot;.  

Whilst co-op was &quot;the most requested feature from fans&quot; and something the team was keen to implement, Supermassive said that it needed to balance the fun of sharing the spooky happenings with ensuring playing with a pal didn&#x27;t ameliorate the tension.

&quot;Co-op was the most requested feature from our fans, so it was really important for us to give them that,&quot; Bandai Namco producer Coralie Feniello told GamesRadar. &quot;I do think that it will add a layer to the game as well, by letting you experience it with a friend.

                              <span>The media artists union SAG-AFTRA has voted to expand its ongoing Hollywood strike to encompass the games industry.

In a statement posted to its official website, the union confirmed its board had &quot;voted unanimously&quot; to &quot;send a strike authorisation vote to SAG-AFTRA members&quot; in interactive media ahead of its &quot;forthcoming bargaining dates with video game companies&quot;. 

Key issues up for negotiation include pay and conditions, but also &quot;protections against unrestrained use of artificial intelligence&quot;, specifically the impact upon performance capture artists.

                              <span>Starfield includes a heartfelt tribute to – and from – a fan who died before the game was released.

Six months ago, Alex Hay posted on the Starfield subreddit to share his dismay that despite &quot;following this project for years&quot;, he probably wouldn&#x27;t live long enough to play Starfield following a lung cancer diagnosis at just 36 years of age. 

Just a few weeks later, the thread was updated to confirm that Alex - who himself was an app developer - had indeed sadly died, but revealed that Hay had been a huge Bethesda fan and took great comfort playing games whilst under palliative care, calling his Xbox &quot;a great form of escapism&quot;.

In a tweet posted to the studio&#x27;s Japanese language player support X/Twitter account, the team confirmed the issue was affecting players who put their PCs to sleep whilst the game was still running. Consequently, it&#x27;s now urging players to save and properly shut down Armored Core 6 before their PCs slip into sleep mode.

&quot;In the PC version of &#x27;Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon&#x27;, there is a problem that save data is not saved properly under certain circumstances,&quot; the developer explained, as translated by Google Translate.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is celebrating its three-year anniversary by trumpeting 3m copies sold since launch and by releasing a bunch of statistics gleaned in that time, suggesting players&#x27; conflict resolution skills may need some work - or at least, a little less of a preoccupation with murder.


According to Paradox, a grand total of 50,159,539 murder schemes have been successfully carried out since Crusader Kings 3&#x27;s arrival back in 2020. That&#x27;s nearly 16m more murder plots than wedding celebrations, which currently sit at 34,480,042. And, of course, more than a few chaotic sorts have thoroughly muddied the waters between the two, with Paradox reporting a total of 7,790 bloody weddings have been msaterminded by players who cleary weren&#x27;t going to let a bit of murder get in the way of anyone&#x27;s big day - or possiby vice versa.


Paradox&#x27;s other shared stats don&#x27;t open up quite such a fascinating window on player behaviour, but we do know 1,325,198 grand tournaments have been bravely fought since launch, and 1,037,787 grand weddings have also been held. In total, player have amassed more than 317m hours in-game, with nearly 1.4m players having joined this year alone.

                              <span>Gunbrella, the 2D platform-shooter from developer Doinksoft and publisher Devolver Digital that very much lives up to its title, finally has a release date and will be unfurling onto Switch and PC with a dramatic fwap on 13th September.


Doinksoft&#x27;s &quot;gritty noir-punk action-adventure&quot; follows the adventures of a gruff woodsman armed with the high-calibre brolly of the title as he embarks on a request for revenge. Soon, because this is very much one of those games, players become embroiled in a conspiracy involving ghouls, gangsters, cops, cultists, and, of course, a corporation run amok.


In more practical terms, that manifests as a side-scrolling action-platformer in which players take on the might of their foes using a brolly that&#x27;s simultaneously a gun - enhanceable with munitions and upgrades fashioned from gathered scrap - plus a handy all-in-one shield.

                              <span>Following the release of last week&#x27;s splendid Echoes update, No Man&#x27;s Sky has now launched its latest limited-time expedition, Voyagers, giving players approximately six weeks to complete its objectives and secure some very nifty rewards - including an adorable HoverDroid companion, looking very much like a flying Roomba with eyes.


Voyagers - which, like all previous expeditions, starts players afresh on a completely new save - begins aboard a freighter in No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Oishida system, where Travelers will embark on a journey to complete exploration-focused objectives, discovering new creatures, braving extreme planets, digging up ancient treasures, and more along the way.


If you&#x27;re new to all this, expeditions are something like No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim&#x27;s various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. Completing all objectives within a tier unlocks a new reward exclusive to the expedition and completing all tiers awards one final prize.

                              <span>You know when you want to do a spot of time travelling, but you get to your DeLorean and it is just caked top to bottom in all sorts of gunk and grime? No, you don&#x27;t? Well, PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab certainly does.


Today, the jet-loving team announced the Back to the Future collaboration for its beloved clean-it-up game (which is a bit of a Eurogamer favourite). FuturLab has said this DLC pack, which will retail at £6.49/$7.99/€7.99, will be a faithful homage to Marty and Doc&#x27;s time travelling escapades. 


So, what can you expect to clean on this DLC&#x27;s release? Well, of course, you will have to get your watery-jets into every nook and cranny of the series&#x27; Time Machine. It really wouldn&#x27;t be a Back to the Future collaboration without it. Additionally, Doc&#x27;s van, Hill Valley Clock Tower, the Holomax Theatre and Doc&#x27;s Time Train will all need to be sprayed to perfection.

                              <span>They say that visiting Ikea and building flatpack furniture is one of the greatest tests of any relationship.


Now that experience has been adapted into video game form.


The aptly named KallaX, developed by French indie studio Unexpected, is a new co-op game that sees 2 - 6 players building furniture together - in space, no less.

                              <span>The NES released in Japan 40 years ago, but a new Rugrats game is on the way to Nintendo&#x27;s old console next year.


Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland is a classic mascot platformer based on the 90s Nickelodeon TV series coming to PC, consoles, and the NES.


The game is presented in retro 8-bit graphics, though modern versions will also include a HD graphics option to toggle on a smooth hand-drawn look.

                              <span>Starfield has only been out in early access for a matter of hours, but fans are already taking matters into their own hands to alter the game&#x27;s FOV.


While Bethesda may yet provide an official option in future, there&#x27;s no way currently to alter Starfield&#x27;s FOV for yourself within the game. 


But, already, there are a number of downloads available on NexusMods for players to tinker with the FOV, via a new text file added to the game&#x27;s folder on your PC.

The game released overnight for those who purchase its pricey £85.99 premium edition, which allows access ahead of the release on 6th September.


Already, Starfield has reached a peak of 234,502 concurrent players, according to SteamDB. At the time of writing it&#x27;s the sixth most played game on the platform, behind only heavy hitters like CS:GO, Dota 2, and Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.

                              <span>Last year, Bethesda described Starfield as having a &quot;NASA-Punk&quot; aesthetic. This term was coined by the development team to describe &quot;a sci-fi universe that&#x27;s a little more grounded and relatable&quot;. Essentially, Bethesda wants its game to have a sense of realism meets grit, and it is doing this by combining the practicality of real-life space technology with the aesthetics of Punk culture. 


Now, this design decision has got the European Space Agency&#x27;s approval, with its head of branding and partnerships Emmet Fletcher telling me he believes Starfield&#x27;s NASA-Punk aesthetic &quot;humanises&quot; the game.


&quot;This is the aesthetic where you basically have worn and loved futuretech? Actually, if you look at some of the things we have, it&#x27;s a little bit like that already,&quot; he told me from his office in Paris earlier this week. &quot;We have things that if it works, it carries on working. And there&#x27;s no need to change it. It&#x27;s about reliability, and if it&#x27;s reliable, it carries on.&quot;

                              <span>Gearbox&#x27;s Borderlands series is readying for a busy few months; a six-game digital-only Borderlands bundle is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC tomorrow, 1st September, and Borderlands 3 will be making its Switch debut on 6th October.


Starting with the Borderlands Collection: Pandora&#x27;s Box, as the bundle is officially known, it packages up every game in the series so far, excluding last year&#x27;s Tina Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands spin-off - so, Borderlands 1, 2, The Pre-Sequel, 3, Tales from the Borderlands, and New Tales from the Borderlands - and then crams in every bit of accompanying DLC.


It&#x27;s a significant amount of Borderlands, then, and the bundle comes with a correspondingly sizeable price tag, weighing in at $149.99 USD (or your local equivalent). The happier news, though, is that publisher 2K is offering a range of discounts, starting with a far more affordable $59.99 limited-time launch price. Additionally, 2K has announced a number of upgrade paths for existing Borderlands players, making the cost of entry more manageable still.

Volition, which celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this year, announced the closure in a statement shared on social media, writing, &quot;This past June, Embracer Group announced a restructuring programme to strengthen and maintain its position as a leader in the video game industry. As part of that programme, they evaluated strategic and operational goals and made the difficult decision to close Volition effective immediately.&quot;


The statement adds that Embracer is &quot;working to provide job assistance and help smooth the transition for our Volition family members&quot;. The move is likely to effect around 340 people based on the studio&#x27;s most recently shared employment figures.

                              <span>A Brazilian spyware app vendor was hacked by activists:
In an undated note seen by TechCrunch, the unnamed hackers described how they found and exploited several security vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise WebDetetive’s servers and access its user databases. By exploiting other flaws in the spyware maker’s web dashboard—used by abusers to access the stolen phone data of their victims—the hackers said they enumerated and downloaded every dashboard record, including every customer’s email address.
The hackers said that dashboard access also allowed them to delete victim devices from the spyware network altogether, effectively severing the connection at the server level to prevent the device from uploading new data. “Which we definitely did.

On August 15, 2023, the Kubernetes project announced the general availability of
the community-owned package repositories for Debian and RPM packages available
at pkgs.k8s.io. The new package repositories are replacement for the legacy
Google-hosted package repositories: apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io.
The
announcement blog post for pkgs.k8s.io
highlighted that we will stop publishing packages to the legacy repositories in
the future.
Today, we&#x27;re formally deprecating the legacy package repositories (apt.kubernetes.io
and yum.kubernetes.io), and we&#x27;re announcing our plans to freeze the contents of
the repositories as of September 13, 2023.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re back from Gamescom and scurrying around trying to let you know everything we saw. We chatted to Phil Spencer, we saw Starfield, we played Sonic and much more. But what else caught our eye?

We sat down this week to chat about what we saw and ended up honing in on some of our personal favourites - games which may not have caught the headlines as much as that big new RPG everyone&#x27;s going on about. Games which appealed specifically to us - because they felt authentically British - like the wonderfully Yorkshire Thank Goodness You&#x27;re Here and the North Sea oil rig horror Still Wakes the Deep. 
I adored The Plucky Squire. Ed loved Black Myth: Wukong. Together with Victoria Kennedy, who held the news fort brilliantly back home in Blighty, we chat about the best of what we saw last week in Cologne.

                              <span>Fellow puzzlers, there is good news. Not only has the second expansion for The Case of the Golden Idol been announced, but it is actually available now. 


Known as The Lemurian Vampire, this expansion connects the game&#x27;s previous expansion Spider of Lanka directly to the main game. &quot;The only thing that stands in your way, is the mysterious Tower Dweller and its powerful Golden artefact,&quot; developer Color Gray Games teased. 


The Lemurian Vampire consists of three new scenarios to mull over, as you &quot;follow the perilous journey of the Lemurian delegation to Monkey Paw Island&quot;. These delegates are on the search for the fountain of youth (aren&#x27;t we all?), and of course any riches that may be hidden along the way.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed its latest Switch OLED model - the Mario Red edition.


This new console edition is, as you can see in the header image above, very red. It features a little Mario silhouette tucked away on the back corner of the base, as well as some hidden coins inside its back panel.


This new Switch OLED will be available to scoop up from 6th October. While Nintendo hasn&#x27;t shared specifics yet, it has said to keep an eye out for more information on pre-orders, and presumably a price, &quot;soon&quot;.

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s Prime Gaming offers several free titles throughout the month of September, including Football Manager 2023 and the winemaking sim Hundred Days.


In our Football Manager 2023 review on PC, we described it as &quot;the best sim of its kind&quot;, however contributor Phil Iwaniuk felt the &quot;lack of major improvements shows an annual release schedule taking its toll&quot;.


As for Hundred Days, our Bertie spoke to Yves Hohler, lead designer of the game, back in 2021, to learn more about how his experiences shaped the winemaking sim. It&#x27;s a cute and cosy game that never feels bogged down by the management aspect, instead presenting a whimsical love letter to Hohler&#x27;s earlier life.

Tune in for 15 minutes of new details and gameplay from Nintendo&#x27;s brilliantly bizarre-looking Mario sidescroller, which is due to launch for Nintendo Switch in October. 


So far we&#x27;ve seen that Super Mario Bros. Wonder will let Mario turn into an elephant - but what else does Nintendo have stuffed down its weird, wriggling warp pipes? And can you identify the new voice playing Mario, following the departure of Charles Martinet? Tune in right here to find out.

                              <span>Ubisoft classic Beyond Good &amp; Evil is getting another re-release, according to a listing which has popped up via the US game ratings board.


An ESRB listing shows the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition as coming to Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S (thanks, MACOS380).


Ubisoft has yet to announce this new re-release, or detail what it might contain. Eurogamer has contacted the publisher for comment.

                              <span>Just when you thought you knew everything about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - all the top tips and tricks - a fresh handful of them come along and take you by surprise. Well, they take me by surprise - I bet you&#x27;re much more savvy than me. Just in case you aren&#x27;t, though, and you&#x27;re a kindred spirit, here&#x27;s what I stumbled upon.
The tip that really took me by surprise is this. Did you know that you can initiate combat during an interaction cut-scene to affect the outcome of it? It means you can potentially save a character scripted to be attacked - and maybe killed - during the cut-scene before it actually happens. 
The tip comes from content creator ESO Danny. As the video points out, you can interrupt a cut-scene by selecting the &quot;Attack&quot; circular button/option in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has said its decision to only develop one expansion for its ambitious sci-fi role-player was based solely on &quot;technological&quot; factors. 


The drama around Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s initial launch and subsequent withdrawal from sale on PlayStation, as well as the game&#x27;s overall sales figures, all had nothing to do with it, the developer has stated. 


&quot;As we have announced a long time ago, we&#x27;re not going to make a second or third expansion,&quot; CD Projekt exec Michał Nowakowski said in an investor Q&amp;A held last night (thanks, VGC). &quot;This is the only expansion of the game, and it has nothing to do with the numbers and how satisfied or not we are with sales or anything of the kind.&quot;

                              <span>Focus Entertainment has shared extended gameplay footage - and by &#x27;extended&#x27;, I mean &#x27;a combined 25-ish minutes worth&#x27; - of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 and the Don&#x27;t-Nod-developed Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden as part of a mini-showcase aired this evening.


Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - which is due to launch for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 on 7th November - sees Life is Strange and Vampyr developer Don&#x27;t Nod heading to the frozen wilderness of North America, circa 1695, for a tale of ghost-hunting lovers, one of whom is (rather awkwardly given their profession) recently undead.


It&#x27;s the pleasingly spooky set-up for an action-RPG that promises a &quot;mystical, lore-rich world plagued with supernatural creatures and ancient secrets&quot;, and Banishers&#x27; extended gameplay trailer follows our heroes Red and the spirit-y Antea as they investigate a haunting at the behest of a New Eden villager - an investigation that leaps between the physical and spectral worlds, and somehow manages to involve quite a lot of gun.

                              <span>Activision has announced new measures to combat toxicity within Call of Duty, confirming it&#x27;ll be introducing what it calls &quot;global real-time voice chat moderation&quot; alongside the launch of Modern Warfare 3 on 10th November, with a US beta trial of the feature starting today.


Call of Duty&#x27;s new voice chat moderation system will employ AI-powered technology from Modulate to identify and enforce against toxic speech in real-time, with flagged language including hate speech, discrimination, and harassment.


An initial beta for Call of Duty&#x27;s new voice moderation system is being rolled out across Warzone and Modern Warfare 2 starting today, 30th August, in North America, and a global release will coincide with Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s arrival in November. Activision notes the tools will only support English at first, with additional languages coming &quot;at a later date&quot;.

Pokémon Go&#x27;s initial Paldea line-up arrives across two consecutive updates as part of its latest season, beginning on Tuesday, 5th September. Sprigatito, Floragato, Meowscarada, Fuecoco, Crocalor, Skeledirge, Quaxly, Quaxwell, Quaquaval, Lechonk, and Oinkologne (both male and female variants) are all up first, with Lechonk even getting a Shiny variant at launch.


This starting batch debuts in Pokémon Go&#x27;s A Paldean Adventure event, which runs from 5th September until Sunday, 10th September. Other additions include Lechonk-focused Timed Research, Unown in global raids, and various event bonuses, as detailed in Niantic&#x27;s post.

                              <span>A fresh trailer for Bō: Path of The Teal Lotus has revealed more of its combat and abilities, all of which stem from Japanese folklore.


The game will be published by Humble Games and is being developed by Squid Shock Studios, comprising members of the AM2R team - an unofficial fan remake of Metroid 2.


Bō: Path of The Teal Lotus is, understandably, a Metroidvania, but with a beautiful Japanese art style reminiscent of Okami. Check out the new trailer below.

                              <span>Konami has delayed its remasters of Suikoden 1 and 2, originally set for release in 2023.


It&#x27;s unclear when the remasters will now launch, though a statement from Konami simply reads &quot;as soon as is possible&quot;.


&quot;Regarding the planned release of Suikoden 1 and 2 HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, we have reached the conclusion that despite the very best efforts of our dedicated development staff to release the Remasters in 2023, additional time is needed to ensure the quality performance and gameplay experience our users deserve,&quot; reads the statement.

It&#x27;s an impressive number for the indie game from The Messenger developer Sabotage Studio. It&#x27;s doubly impressive when the game was released simultaneously on both Game Pass and PlayStation Plus - the first game to do so. 


The sales announcement, made on X (formerly Twitter), specifies copies sold rather than the game&#x27;s overall players, meaning that 100k number reflects Steam and Switch sales.

In an interview with Games Radar at Gamescom, Iizuka discussed the future of the Sonic franchise and the need to maintain both 2D and 3D Sonic games in parallel.


&quot;When we talk about the brand, we definitely need to have a modern Sonic 3D game,&quot; he said. &quot;We also feel we need to have a classic Sonic 2D game. Those are our fundamental pillars that we need to have. We&#x27;re expanding into movies and TV, but we still need to have both the 3D and the 2D line up for our gaming audience.&quot;

                              <span>A week after Baldur&#x27;s Gate got its first major patch - bringing around 1,000 bug fixes among other things - developer Larian Studios has shared initial details on its next big batch of changes, fixes, and additions, which it says is &quot;just around the corner&quot;.


Patch 2&#x27;s headline features include Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s first &quot;substantial performance improvements&quot; and better closure to its story. Starting with performance, Larian is promising improvements across the entire game, but says &quot;Act 3 [is] where you&#x27;ll feel it the most&quot;.


Specifically, Patch 2 will target the city of Baldur&#x27;s Gate itself, which Digital Foundry&#x27;s recently highlighted as a serious rough spot in an otherwise impressive game. Larian, for its part, calls the area &quot;ambitious technically, narratively, and in scope&quot;, saying, &quot;One of the biggest issues with creating games is that technology is always trying to keep up with your ambition, and here we&#x27;ve been hit pretty hard by some setbacks.&quot;

                              <span>Pioneers of Pagonia, the intriguing new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich and his team at Envision Entertainment, is launching into Steam early access on 13th December, with a public demo and closed alpha planned before then.


Pioneers of Pagonia, for the uninitiated, whisks players away to the procedurally generated islands of Pagonia, where they&#x27;ll need to establish a presence - steadily increasingly their reach and influence among the islands&#x27; many fantastical, not always friendly inhabitants - through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover along the way.


We got a first taste of Pioneers of Pagonia&#x27;s city building action back in June - via an extremely adorable in-game reveal trailer - and Envision has been sharing occassional gameplay details in posts on Steam too. Soon, though, it&#x27;ll be time for players to get stuck in, starting with a closed alpha in September - which will be available to selected subscribers of the studio&#x27;s newsletter.

                              <span>Jupiter Corporation - the studio behind Nintendo&#x27;s long-running Picross series - has unveiled a new Picross-style puzzler, Logiart Grimoire, which launches into Steam early access on 11th September and Switch sometime next year.


The Logiart Grimoire of the title is a magical book formerly used to solve Logiart mysteries before its power waned, and it comes into players&#x27; possession along with its custodian, a helpful wizard-y companion called Emil. That whole fanciful framing device is, of course, secondary to the real business at hand: solving &#x27;picture logic puzzles&#x27; that feature horizontal and vertical rows of numbers used as hints to place dots on a grid and form illustrations.


If that sounds familiar, it&#x27;s because Logiart Grimoire is essentially Picross in all but name (Nintendo owns the &#x27;Picross&#x27; title, while Jupiter owns its systems), albeit with an added magic twist hooking into a new &quot;fusion&quot; system that challenges players to figure out how to combine materials gained through solving puzzles to unlock new ones.

                              <span>Interesting story of an Apple Macintosh app that went rogue. Basically, it was a good app until one particular update…when it went bad.
With more official macOS features added in 2021 that enabled the “Night Shift” dark mode, the NightOwl app was left forlorn and forgotten on many older Macs. Few of those supposed tens of thousands of users likely noticed when the app they ran in the background of their older Macs was bought by another company, nor when earlier this year that company silently updated the dark mode app so that it hijacked their machines in order to send their IP data through a server network of affected computers, AKA a botnet...</span>

We are thrilled to announce the v0.8.0 release of Gateway API! With this
release, Gateway API support for service mesh has reached Experimental
status. We look forward to your feedback!
We&#x27;re especially delighted to announce that Kuma 2.3+, Linkerd 2.14+, and Istio
1.16+ are all fully-conformant implementations of Gateway API service mesh
support.
Service mesh support in Gateway API

Picking up figurines with my hands to inspect them closely. Looking down at the dusty library below me from my cosy attic - a library Moss fans will certainly be familiar with.


That&#x27;s the power of virtual reality, something developer Polyarc is particularly adept at harnessing. Moss and its sequel remain two of the best adventures playable in VR; now there&#x27;s Glassbreakers, a game set in the same world but with totally different gameplay.


Polyarc describes the game as a live service 1v1 real-time battler. In practice, it&#x27;s you against another player online aiming to take control of a hex board using three champions who auto-battle in real time. You strategically manoeuvre your characters across the board to destroy your opponent&#x27;s tower. It looks a bit like holochess in Star Wars, but with woodland creatures instead of aliens.

                              <span>German developer Mimimi Games has announced the studio&#x27;s closure, which will gradually happen over the coming months.

The announcement comes shortly after the release of real-time strategy stealth game Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew two weeks ago. Other games under Mimimi&#x27;s belt include Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperados 3.

The statement regarding the studio&#x27;s closure, attributed to co-founders Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth, was posted on Mimimi&#x27;s website which, at time of writing, returns a 403 error but can be viewed as a cached version via Google.

                              <span>Nintendo will broadcast a special Nintendo Direct presentation this week focusing entirely on Super Mario Bros. Wonder, its upcoming trippy side-scroller.


Tune in this Thursday, 31st August at 3pm UK time for roughly 15 minutes of action from the game, broadcast via YouTube - or hosted right here on Eurogamer. 


Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the first all-new side-scrolling Mario game from Nintendo for a decade, and it looks to shake up the series&#x27; formula. Oh, and yes, Mario can turn into an elephant.

                              <span>Activision has given us our best look yet at Tomb Raider&#x27;s Lara Croft in Call of Duty.


The design has taken most of its inspiration from the &#x27;Classic Lara&#x27; look of old, with her dual pistols, tank top and braid all taking pride of place in the promotional shots released so far (see header above, and image below). 
This version of Lara also wears the necklace from the Tomb Raider reboot games, perhaps giving us a look at how Lara might appear in the series&#x27; future, unified timeline. She certainly looks older than the &#x27;Survivor&#x27; timeline Lara, who we last saw in 2018&#x27;s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

                              <span>It&#x27;s only been a few days since Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon released, and yet fans are already finding unique ways to play.
Although a core appeal of the game&#x27;s mechas are the fun guns and lasers you can outfit your robot with, you can still have a great time without them.
This is what YouTuber ZeroLenny set out to prove by beating Armored Core 6 without any weapons - no guns, no rockets, just pure force and punches.

                              <span>The developer behind upcoming zombie MMO The Day Before has filed a new trademark for something known as Dayworld, suggesting a name change is in the pipeline.


This new trademark, spotted by WellPlayed, covers a range of categories, including &quot;downloadable game software; computer game software downloadable from a global computer network; downloadable computer game software for use on mobile devices&quot;,  and more.  


As a quick reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release on PC back in March. However, in a bizarre series of events, it transpired that developer Fntastic had failed to trademark the game&#x27;s name, which had subsequently been contested by a company behind a calendar app.

                              <span>Armored Core 6 features the Moonlight Greatsword from Dark Souls, which makes it a Soulslike.


I jest of course. The Armored Core series is very much its own thing. But the inclusion of this iconic weapon is a fun Easter egg present through most FromSoftware games.


The weapon first appeared in the studio&#x27;s 1994 game King&#x27;s Field as the Moonlight Sword and has since appeared in most of its games in various guises, from Dark Souls to Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and past Armored Core games.

                              <span>Turns out that it’s easy to broadcast radio commands that force Polish trains to stop:
…the saboteurs appear to have sent simple so-called “radio-stop” commands via radio frequency to the trains they targeted. Because the trains use a radio system that lacks encryption or authentication for those commands, Olejnik says, anyone with as little as $30 of off-the-shelf radio equipment can broadcast the command to a Polish train­—sending a series of three acoustic tones at a 150.100 megahertz frequency­—and trigger their emergency stop function...</span>

This blog describes the mixed version proxy, a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.28. The
mixed version proxy enables an HTTP request for a resource to be served by the correct API server
in cases where there are multiple API servers at varied versions in a cluster. For example,
this is useful during a cluster upgrade, or when you&#x27;re rolling out the runtime configuration of
the cluster&#x27;s control plane.
What problem does this solve?
When a cluster undergoes an upgrade, the kube-apiservers existing at different versions in that scenario can serve different sets (groups, versions, resources) of built-in resources. A resource request made in this scenario may be served by any of the available apiservers, potentially resulting in the request ending up at an apiserve…</span>

That&#x27;s according to performance director Aliona Baranova, who posted a lengthy thread to Xitter over the weekend to detail exactly how much work goes into making your favourite games feel &quot;so alive&quot;.

&quot;[For a]lmost ALL the dialogue we recorded, we ALSO captured the actors mocap data,&quot; Baranova explained. &quot;That means all 248 actors, ALL the NPCs and not just the companions put on a mocap suit and their movements, gestures, and physical choices were recorded and sent along with the audio files for the animators to use in game. which is why the performances feels so alive.&quot;

&quot;I do not encourage doing this,&quot; Luckyy was quick to add. &quot;but I was curious if this is in fact happening.&quot;

Talking to IGN, Boon reflected on the importance of enabling influencers and content creators to monetise their Mortal Kombat 1-flavoured content, but acknowledged that if there was a mode that &quot;turned off all the blood or something&quot;, it would &quot;strip away an entire layer&quot; of Mortal Kombat&#x27;s very identity.

&quot;Let&#x27;s say we had a mode that turned off all the blood or something or didn&#x27;t have fatalities or something like that,&quot; Boon said when asked if the NetherRealm team had ever considered a &quot;streamer safe&quot; mode.

Lead environment artist Iain Gillespie, associate art director Laura Dodds, and lead designer Rob McLachlan discuss &quot;how the environment will evolve over time as well as the key inspirations behind the game&#x27;s horror&quot;.

&quot;The period, the geographical location of the rig – these all play a crucial role in this narrative-driven horror story,&quot; explains publisher Secret Mode. &quot;Fans will discover how the team developed a fascination for cranes and scoured British Petroleum&#x27;s documentary archives when striving for an authentic representation of a Scottish oil rig in the 1970s.&quot;

                              <span>Cast your mind back to the halcyon days of July 2022 (PowerWash Simulator came out, it was fab) and you might recall developer Digital Extremes unveiling its first new property since Warframe&#x27;s release back in 2013: a free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG going by the name Soulframe. One and a bit years later, and the studio is finally ready to give it a proper showing, airing 30 minutes of gameplay during its TennoCon 2023 fan convention this weekend.


Soulframe&#x27;s development is being lead by former Warframe creative director Geoff Crookes (Rebecca Ford has taken over the role on Warframe, driving the sci-fi shooter in a wonderfully bonkers new direction over the last few years) and takes players to a world that, as was explained during its initial reveal, is &quot;a little angry about what&#x27;s been done to it&quot;. This causes the earth to shift throughout the day, giving Digital Extremes the lore excuse it needs to introduce some of its beloved procedural dungeons, here found deep underground.


These dungeons do eventually put in an appearance during Soulframe&#x27;s 30-minute gameplay reveal, but first we get a more thorough glimpse of how Soulframe&#x27;s action plays out. The title has been described as a &quot;mirror universe&quot; to Warframe, meaning that while some element will be familiar to fans of the free-to-play sci-fi shooter - those procedural dungeons, for instance - a lot is very different, with slow-paced melee combat in a fantasy setting being the vibe here.

                              <span>As part of its big TennoCon 2023 fan convention news blowout, developer Digital Extremes has pulled back the veil on Warframe&#x27;s next big expansion, Whisper in the Walls, as well as detailing the free-to-play sci-fi shooter&#x27;s mid-term future as its celebrates the big one-oh - including perhaps its wildest expansion yet in next year&#x27;s Warframe: 1999.


Whisper in the Walls, though - which was revealed with the huge 20-minute chunk of gameplay you can see below - is certainly no slouch on the wild front, continuing Warframe&#x27;s wonderfully weird streak by folding in mysterious multi-storey men, instantaneous dimensional shifts, and even brief glimpses of extremely out-of-place retro Earth tech - 80s mobile phones and beige PCs with CRTs to name a few - in its arresting unveiling.


As explained by Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford in a press event prior to TennoCon, Whisper in the Walls - which introduces new missions types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, alongside a new hub and procedural tile set - is all about going back to the familiar and re-contextualising everything players have seen so far in their ten-year Warframe journey.

                              <span>As part of its recently publicised cutbacks, BioWare has &quot;let go of&quot; Lukas Kristjanson, the lead writer behind Baldur&#x27;s Gate 1 and 2, and the writer of the first three Dragon Age games, Mary Kirby.

BioWare announced earlier this week that it&#x27;ll be laying off approximately 50 employees - around 20 per cent of its total workforce, according to recent employment figures - as part of a &quot;shift towards a more agile and more focused studio&quot;. Each writer had been with the studio for over 20 years. 

Kristjanson is widely credited for not just bringing us the original Baldur&#x27;s Gate games, but also credited as the writer behind some of gaming&#x27;s most iconic characters, including Minsc and Mass Effect&#x27;s Joker.

                              <span>Bad news, RoboCop fans – Rogue City has once again been delayed, this time slipping to 2nd November 2023 (and not November 2024, as detailed on some of the game&#x27;s promotional materials).

RoboCop: Rogue City was initially announced back in 2021 and has been delayed several times since. To soften the blow of the delay, however, publisher Nacon has treated us to a new gameplay trailer, which you can check out it all its bullet-y glory below:

It&#x27;s only a minute and a half long, but the teaser gives us a balanced look at both the cinematics, storyline, and gameplay, including the frenzied FPS action and some of the game&#x27;s more puzzle-like segments.

The &quot;Sega New&quot; broadcast – set for 11am UK time on 21st September (that&#x27;s 7pm Japan time, and 3am PT) – will be broadcast via Sega&#x27;s Japanese and English websites and YouTube channels, informing players &quot;all about the newest titles from Sega and Atlus&quot;.

If you&#x27;re hoping for more details, I&#x27;m afraid there aren&#x27;t any at this moment in time – neither Sega nor Atlus have dropped any clues as to what the presentation may entail beyond confirming that the show is expected to last around 50 minutes.

                              <span>After &quot;diligently monitoring your feedback&quot;, Blizzard has posted the notes for its upcoming 1.1.3 Diablo 4 patch, which is set to roll out on all platforms next week.

First up on the docket are Monsters, and specifically, the monster abilities and elite affixes that apply to Crowd Control effects. Blizzard says these changes are aimed at the player having &quot;less time being Crowd Controlled and receiving more recovery time after being Crowd Controlled, especially at higher World Tiers&quot;.

From 29th August onwards, Cold Enchanted Elites that attack in quick succession, such as Ghost Archers and Snake Brutes, will&quot; no longer proc the Cold Enchanted on every hit&quot;, and Chilling Wind will &quot;spawn overlapping walls less often&quot;.

                              <span>Genshin Impact fans are reporting that malicious players are using its co-op feature to infiltrate other players&#x27; worlds and delete in-game items like seele, chests, and elemental totems, preventing them from progressing. 

Right now, the issue is primarily affecting players on the Chinese server, but given the issue appears to permanently &quot;brick&quot; progress – even if you reinstall the game or play on a different device – all players are warned not to join any stranger&#x27;s co-op game until the issue has been resolved. 

According to some players affected by the issue, the &quot;destruction is irreversible&quot;. This video, for instance, shows how an elemental totem – used to get around the world – was deleted, bricking the player&#x27;s time-limited challenges and preventing them from progressing.

                              <span>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners eagerly awaiting the previously announced August release of ghost hunting hit Phasmophobia will now have a bit longer to wait; developer Kinetic Games has opted to push launch back to October after a &quot;recent fire incident&quot;.


Phasmophobia first made waves when it launched into early access on PC back in September 2020, quickly amassing an enthusiastic following after streamers helped propel its spooky investigatory ghost hunting action - which sees players attempting to gather evidence and complete objectives across a variety of haunted locales - up the charts as Halloween struck.


Since then, Kinetic Games has continued to expand and evolve the core co-operative ghost hunting experience with new maps, new equipment, new ghost types, better haunting AI, and, more recently, custom difficulty settings. And with the PC version developing nicely, a console release was confirmed earlier this year, with the studio announcing Phasmophobia would hit PlayStation 5 (including PSVR2) and Xbox Series X/S this August.

                              <span>What&#x27;s happening with Hyenas? Announced a year ago but still without a release date, Creative Assembly&#x27;s team-based sci-fi extraction shooter was playable publicly this week for the first time at Gamescom in Cologne, following a somewhat eye-opening summation of its status last week from Sega top brass.


I played a brief match of Hyenas on the Gamescom showfloor and found it a bright and breezy shooter with fun PVPVE moments and some promising zero-G sections. But my time with it was too brief to really leave with much of a lasting impression. 


It&#x27;s good news, then, that Hyenas will soon be available to play more widely, via a Steam beta test you can sign up for now, with access going live on 31st August. It&#x27;s from that, I think, that people will finally be able to decide for themselves what is working and what is not - and this is Creative Assembly told me it is waiting for as well.

                              <span>A little over three years after acclaimed construction and automation sim Factorio left its lengthy early access with a 1.0 release, developer Wube Software has shared details of its first expansion, Space Age, which will be picking up right where the base game stops.


Factorio, for the uninitiated, casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation. The ultimate goal is to build a rocket ship enabling you to escape the planet you&#x27;ve crash-landed on, which is the point where Space Age kicks in.


In a post revealing first concrete details of Factorio&#x27;s expansion, Wube explained Space Age continues the journey after those rockets have launched, taking players out among the stars where they can &quot;discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage [their] fleet of interplanetary space platforms.&quot;
