                              <span>A study conducted by Norwegian researchers has suggested children feel increasing social pressure to spend money in games.
The study, commissioned by the Norwegian government&#x27;s Ministry of Children and Family Affairs, was conducted by researchers Clara Julia Reich and Kamilla Knutsen Steinnes at Oslo Metropolitan University&#x27;s National Institute for Consumer Research.
An overview of the two resulting reports, originally written in Norwegian, by ScienceNorway.no reveals children the pair spoke to worried about being bullied and being unable to make friends unless they spent money to buy cosmetic items (thanks, Crossplay).

These reductions at the studio come as part of yesterday&#x27;s announcement that 900 PlayStation employees will lose their jobs across multiple studios and departments. In total, this equates to eight percent of PlayStation&#x27;s workforce.
According to Dutch newspaper AD (via VGC), Guerilla is set to lay off 40 employees, about 10 percent of its staff. Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment.

The lawsuit is against Tropic Haze, the creator of the Yuzu game emulator, which Nintendo said allows users to play its games illegally by circumventing its software encryption.


As such, Nintendo claimed Yuzu facilitates piracy &quot;at a colossal scale&quot;, with pirated versions of Tears of the Kingdom used as an example.

That&#x27;s according to group behind the alleged attack, Mogilevich, as reported by Cyber Daily. Epic Games is yet to respond.


The hacked data allegedly includes &quot;email, passwords, full name, payment information, source code and many other data&quot; - though it&#x27;s unclear if this refers to the details of Epic Games employees, customers, or both.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been over seven years since Limbo and Inside developer Playdead first began teasing its mysterious third project, and now - nearly five years since Eurogamer last has cause to write about a sneaky bit of concept art - the studio has shared a handful of new images, confirming (in case there was any doubt) the project is still alive and well.


A first enigmatic bit of concept art for Playdead&#x27;s untitled third game was shared by the developer in 2017, around six months after Inside launched to critical acclaim. At the time, the studio confirmed work was underway on its &quot;next adventure&quot;, with the accompanying artwork pointing to a lonely adventure with sci-fi undertones.


Since then, further bits of atmospheric concept art have sporadically surfaced - first on social media in 2018, then buried in some online job listings in 2019, then on LinkedIn last year - all seemingly pointing to an adventure in which a lone space traveller wanders a desolate planet strewn with abandoned tech. About all we&#x27;ve conclusively learned of the mysterious project in that time, again thanks to Playdead&#x27;s jobs page, is that it&#x27;s a &quot;third-person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe.&quot;

                              <span>Deck Nine Games, the studio behind Life is Strange: True Colors and last year&#x27;s The Expanse: A Telltale Series, has announced it&#x27;s laying off approximately 20 percent of its total workforce, blaming &quot;the game industry&#x27;s worsening market conditions&quot;.


Deck Nine is perhaps best known as the current steward of Square Enix&#x27;s supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange, having created 2017&#x27;s Life is Strange: Before the Storm, 2021&#x27;s Life is Strange: True Colours, and a remaster of series originator Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s acclaimed first instalment in 2022. More recently it co-developed a prequel to popular sci-fi TV show The Expanse alongside the revived Telltales Games.


Deck Nine confirmed its decision to lay off a fifth of its staff - likely around 30 employees based on its most recently shared headcount - in a statement on social media, writing, &quot;Like many others in the games industry right now, Deck Nine has been affected by the game industry&#x27;s worsening market conditions. Today we made the difficult decision to lay off 20% of our staff.&quot;

                              <span>Skull and Bones, the oft-delayed pirate game from Ubisoft that finally arrived earlier this month following almost a decade of development, has released its first season of post-launch content on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - introducing, among other things, new world events, new contracts and bounties, plus a battle-pass-style progression track.


Raging Tides, as Skull and Bones&#x27; first live-service season is officially titled, predominantly focuses on new antagonist Philippe La Peste (AKA the Plague King) and his Fleet of Pestilence. By defeating La Peste&#x27;s advance guard, the Plaguebringers, as they spawn throughout the world, players can raise the fleet&#x27;s hostility level. Once past a certain threshold, they&#x27;ll face a &quot;mighty foe&quot;, which rewards a &quot;rare item&quot; when sunk.


That&#x27;s the core of Raging Tides&#x27; new content, then, but Season 1 also adds two elite boss Kingpin Bounties - Jaws of Retribution: Introducing Zamaharibu and Anguish from the Abyss: Rode Maangodin - which run from 5-26th March and 26th March to 16th April respectively.

As part of its release date anouncement, EA teases F1 24 will feature an &quot;overhauled&quot; Career mode, a new Dynamic Handling System, and more, but says it&#x27;s saving specific details for a full reveal &quot;in the coming months&quot;. However, for those players happy to hand over money without knowing more, the publisher has today detailed a number of F1 24 pre-order bonuses.


Two versions of F1 24 are now available to pre-order: the Standard Edition (containing 5,000 Pitcoin and an F1 World Starter Pack) plus the F1 24 Champions Edition, which includes two new Formula 1 Icons, 18,000 Pitcoin, the F1 World Bumper Pack, a bonus VIP Podium Pass, and up to three days of early access starting from 28th May.

                              <span>In the first week of January, the pharmaceutical giant Merck quietly settled its years-long lawsuit over whether or not its property and casualty insurers would cover a $700 million claim filed after the devastating NotPetya cyberattack in 2017. The malware ultimately infected more than 40,000 of Merck’s computers, which significantly disrupted the company’s drug and vaccine production. After Merck filed its $700 million claim, the pharmaceutical giant’s insurers argued that they were not required to cover the malware’s damage because the cyberattack was widely attributed to the Russian government and therefore was excluded from standard property and casualty insurance coverage as a “hostile or warlike act.”...</span>

                              <span>Publisher NIS America has confirmed a western release for action-RPG Reynatis, which was revealed during the Japanese version of last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.
Reynatis wasn&#x27;t present in the showcase for overseas, but yesterday NIS America announced it&#x27;ll also be released outside of Japan on Nintendo Switch, PC (Steam), PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
The announcement trailer gives us a flavour of the magic-infused world of Reynatis, set in contemporary Shibuya.  The immediate vibes the trailer gives off are Kingdom Hearts meets The World Ends With You, with some hints of Final Fantasy Versus 13 and Kingdom Hearts 3&#x27;s game-within-a-game Verum Rex. You have my attention, Reynatis.

                              <span>Happy Pokémon Day 2024! This year&#x27;s celebrations have been capped off with a relatively short Pokémon Presents livestream, showcasing what&#x27;s in store for the franchise this year and beyond - including Pokémon Legends: Z-A.
Though there was no mention of a main game releasing this year, there&#x27;s a couple of substantial projects to look forward to. Here&#x27;s a roundnup of everything announced during Pokémon Presents for Pokémon Day 2024.
First up, those of you still enjoying Pokémon Scarlet and Violet can challenge a mighty Venusaur, Blastoise, and Charizard in upcoming Tera Raid battles. Mighty Venusaur will be available from tomorrow, 28th March, for a week, after which mighty Blastoise and mighty Charizard will follow.

According to the ever reliable billbil-kun of Dealabs, who has a track record of being right with these things, next month we will be able to get our hands on the standard edition of Sifu. If you aren&#x27;t aware, Sifu is a third-person brawler with &quot;tight Kung Fu combat mechanics and cinematic martial arts action&quot;. It was released by developer Sloclap back in 2022.
Sifu will be available across all PS Plus tiers from 5th March until 2nd April, billbil-kun says.

The announcement was made at the end of today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents stream, in celebration of Pokémon Day 2024.
Pokémon Legends: Z-A looks to be a follow-up to 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Legends: Arceus but set in a futuristic version of Kalos from Pokémon X and Y - the opposite of Arceus, which transported players to a historical version of Sinnoh. A trailer showed a futuristic version of Lumiose City from Pokémon X and Y, which looked a bit like the Grid in Tron.

The first of these is a multiplayer mini-game themed around Lego&#x27;s popular pirates theme, where you must stay afloat on a raft - and repair it on the fly - while it is under attack from cannon fire. 


The latter is an obstacle course mini-game similar to those found within Fortnite&#x27;s user-made Creative mode already - think along the lines of its many parkour levels or popular Only Up maps.

                              <span>Sony is to lay off 900 people, equating to eight percent of its workforce. This reduction will see PlayStation Studios&#x27; London Studio close in its entirety, plus reductions made within Sony&#x27;s Firesprite studio. There will also be reductions in various functions across SIE in the UK
In a post earlier today, Sony&#x27;s Jim Ryan said the company&#x27;s PlayStation community meant &quot;everything to us&quot;, and therefore it felt compelled to share an update on the current situation.
&quot;We have made the extremely hard decision to announce our plan to commence a reduction of our overall headcount globally by about eight percent or about 900 people, subject to local law and consultation processes. Employees across the globe, including our studios, are impacted,&quot; Ryan wrote.

                              <span>A number of developers have said they are concerned about the future of Apple Arcade, with one person stating there is &quot;the smell of death&quot; around the mobile game subscription service.


A source told mobilegamer.biz that Apple had &quot;cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people&quot; following a &#x27;reboot&#x27; of the subscription in 2021. Other sources, meanwhile, said the company had been steadily cutting developer payouts and upfront fees over recent years.


&quot;We&#x27;re going to see that amount and decrease and decrease and decrease until it&#x27;s pennies,&quot; one developer told the publication. &quot;At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.&quot; Reportedly, when Apple Arcade launched in 2019, it was a different story, with &quot;very generous&quot; upfront and per-play payments.

                              <span>The &quot;biggest regret&quot; of the developer behind Cities: Skylines 2 is the game&#x27;s ongoing lack of modding support, Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen has said.
Writing in the studio&#x27;s latest developer diary, posted on publisher Paradox Interactive&#x27;s forum, Hallikainen also detailed the changes Colossal is now looking into based on player feedback.
The city-builder sequel released in October last year on PC and was immediately criticised by players for its performance issues and, yes, missing official mod support. In response to fan complaints the game&#x27;s launch had been a &quot;mess&quot; and a &quot;disaster&quot;, Hallikainen admitted Colossal would &quot;much rather be in a different position than we are in the moment, but we cannot change the past&quot;.

                              <span>Four years after its initial release, Square Enix has patched Final Fantasy 7 Remake to amend one of Aerith&#x27;s lines at the very end of the game.


The update comes ahead of the release of Rebirth later this week and additionally makes a change in Remake to Tifa&#x27;s outfit seen in a certain flashback to ensure consistency across both games.


But why amend this specific line from Aerith? Fans are now debating, as spotted on ResetEra. The ending of Final Fantasy 7 Remake is discussed below.

                              <span>Former Xbox exclusive Pentiment currently runs smoother on PlayStation 5 than on Xbox Series X/S, fans have realised - prompting the game&#x27;s director to blame the situation on a &quot;bug&quot;. 
Social media user PeterOvo shared a screenshot from a video comparison capturing the frames per second performance between Pentiment on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The former was running at 120fps, while the Xbox version was running at a mere 60fps.
This inconsistency was subsequently brought to the attention of Pentiment&#x27;s director, Josh Sawyer. The developer replied to assure players that 120fps will be enabled for Xbox &quot;in the next patch&quot;.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended developer Studio Wildcard has announced it&#x27;s indefinitely delaying the release of the dinosaur survival remaster&#x27;s enhanced The Center expansion, just days before its planned 28th February release.


Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price Unreal Engine 5 remaster of 2015&#x27;s Ark: Survival Evolved - has been plagued with delays since its announcement last year. First, the remaster&#x27;s launch was shifted from August to October - a release it eventually managed to hit on PC, albeit with the Xbox Series X/S version getting a last-minute delay to mid-November and the PS5 release arriving later still - while Ascended&#x27;s various expansion remasters, originally due to launch alongside the base game, have now slipped a number of times.


In January, Wildcard announced its Scorched Earth expansion remaster, initially delayed to December 2023 and then moved to March 2024, would now be releasing in April, while its Aberration and Ragnarok map remasters - previously delayed to &quot;Q1 2024&quot; - were now on track to arrive in July and September 2024 respectively. Amid all this furious roadmap revision, there was a bright spot in that the enhanced version of Ark&#x27;s The Center map would now be coming to Ascended a couple of months earlier than listed in December. The Center&#x27;s release was later pinned down to 28th February, but once again it&#x27;s all change.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s first major content update of 2024 arrives this Wednesday, 28th February, introducing Monsters, Inc.&#x27;s Sully and Mike Wazowski to the village - and ahead of its arrival, developer Gameloft has detailed everything this week&#x27;s free patch will bring.


Mike and Sulley arrive as part of what Gameloft is officially calling the Laugh Floor Update, and both make their Dreamlight Valley debut via a new playable Realm - giving players the chance to experience a day-in-the-life at Monsters, Inc. before the duo become available as villagers - each with their own friendship quests and associated rewards.


Other features coming in this week&#x27;s Laugh Floor Update, as detailed in Gameloft&#x27;s newly shared patch notes, include more avatar customisation options - ranging from new skin tones and special eye contacts to new ear styles - plus an expansion to Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s shop, meaning players will see more items to spend their in-game gold on each day.

                              <span>Stardew Valley is celebrating its eighth anniversary today (yes, I couldn&#x27;t believe it either) and developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone has marked the occasion by announcing a release date for his beloved farm-life sim&#x27;s eagerly awaited 1.6 update - which is coming to PC on 19th March, with a console and mobile release to follow &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.


Stardew Valley&#x27;s 1.6 update was revealed to be in the works back in June 2022, when Barone warned it would be relatively modest in scope and &#x27;mostly modding-focused&#x27;. Since then, however, it&#x27;s ballooned substantially, with Barone so far confirming it&#x27;ll bring one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, plus - most importantly of all - hats for cats and dogs.


It was exactly one month ago today that Barone last shared a progress report on 1.6&#x27;s development, revealing he was &quot;done adding major new content&quot; and that it would &quot;definitely&quot; release this year - and we now have an exact date to mark in our calendars.

                              <span>What the Golf? developer Triband is bringing its absurdist racing game What the Car? to Steam later this year, following its debut last May as an Apple Arcade exclusive.


What the Car? follows in the wonderfully daft footsteps of What the Golf? - and indeed its VR-exclusive baseball-inspired successor What the Bat? - by taking a relatively sensible sport (in this case racing) and sillying it up to the extreme.


If you&#x27;ve long been of the opinion racing games would be a whole lot better if the cars had legs and the racing was spiced up a bit with some cooking, rope jumpinga, CAR-aoke, or even fishing, then What the Car? is probably just what you&#x27;re looking for.

Lots of details in the news articles.
These aren’t details about the tools or techniques, more the inner workings of the company. And they seem to primarily be hacking regionally.</span>

The studio halted production last week on 19th February, it revealed today, and said it made the news public to help its members find roles elsewhere.

                              <span>Supermassive Games, the Guildford-based developer behind Until Dawn, The Quarry and the Dark Pictures anthology horror series, has announced job losses &quot;with deep regret&quot;. 


The studio confirmed it would shed staff via a statement posted to social media platform X, in which it blamed &quot;significant challenges&quot; facing the games industry to which it was not &quot;immune&quot;. 


A Bloomberg report states around 150 people were told their jobs were at risk this morning, with around 90 staff eventually expected to leave the business following a consultation period. Supermassive is believed to currently employ around 350 staff in total.

The upcoming action-RPG is set during the Bakamatsu era of Japan, and will see players play as a Ronin who navigates their way through different political factions as they help to shape the course of history.
Co-op has now been confirmed for Rise of the Ronin via the game&#x27;s FAQ section (spotted by Okami13_ on X), which states players can join up to three others in online co-op. The FAQs also confirm there will be no PvP in Rise of the Ronin.

(To be clear, this is nothing to do with James Cameron&#x27;s blue people.)


Word of the crossover appeared online last night courtesy of prolific Fortnite leaker iFireMonkey, as spotted in the game&#x27;s code. It looks like Avatar will be Fortnite&#x27;s next themed event  pass, following the current Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles event.

                              <span>Nintendo is currently set to launch its under-wraps Switch 2 console in March 2025 - but this could be delayed further, a new report has cautioned. 


The fresh report, this time from Japanese newspaper Nikkei, has further confirmed this month&#x27;s reports that Switch 2 will now arrive next year, after having previously been set for a late 2024 launch. 


Eurogamer sources told us previously that a delay to 2025 was intended to ensure Switch 2 arrived with a robust game line-up, something Nikkei&#x27;s report also mentions. Nikkei additionally suggests a move to 2025 will ensure Switch 2 console stock will also be more readily available.

                              <span>Legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu probably won&#x27;t compose the score for a whole game again.


The composer was interviewed by German publication Zeit Online (via VGC) ahead of his new orchestral piece Merregnon: Heart of Ice and discussed whether he might compose an entire score in future.


&quot;As far as Final Fantasy is concerned, I&#x27;m still involved by writing the main themes for the games,&quot; he said. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll compose music for a whole game again.

                              <span>Epic Mickey creator Warren Spector has said he is currently unavailable to work on a third game in the series, despite the announcement it was being revived. 


Last week brought news of Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, a remake of the cult classic original game in the series, which will launch for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S later this year. 


Writing on LinkedIn, Spector said he &quot;can&#x27;t begin to describe how excited I am&quot; about the remake - but that he wasn&#x27;t quietly working on an all-new third entry behind the scenes.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 continues to do well here in the UK, with boxed sales growing 20 percent in its third week on the market thanks to the game&#x27;s positive reception.
As noted by Chris Dring from Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz, this marks the second week in a row in which the game has seen a comparative sales increase - an unusual occurrence. 
Helldivers 2 is currently sat at number four in the UK&#x27;s physical chart, behind Mario vs Donkey Kong, Hogwarts Legacy and EA Sports FC 24. Ubisoft&#x27;s beleaguered pirate game Skull and Bones has tumbled down to sixteenth place, meanwhile.

Marking the event with celebratory art posted to X/Twitter, producer Asano thanked fans for their support and teased that we should &quot;keep an eye out&quot; for more &quot;developments&quot; about the Bravely series.
&quot;[Bravely] Default 2 3rd anniversary celebration!&quot; Asano wrote, as translated by Google. &quot;Many messages will be sent during the year-end and New Year project. Thank you!

                              <span>Footage of what&#x27;s claimed to be an &quot;internal demo&quot; of LittleBigPlanet Hub – the free-to-play PS3 exclusive announced initially, and expected to be released, in 2013 – has popped up online.
Whilst the game was never formally cancelled, it was never released, either, which makes the footage – which is complete with voicework from series stalwart Stephen Fry and the costumes and gameplay long associated with the family-friendly platformer – all the more surprising.
&quot;LittleBigPlanet Hub beta official gameplay full walkthrough recorded in 2013,&quot; is all the YouTube video&#x27;s description says, with a later Short from the same account alleging that the build was still live and could still be downloaded.

                              <span>Apple announced PQ3, its post-quantum encryption standard based on the Kyber secure key-encapsulation protocol, one of the post-quantum algorithms selected by NIST in 2022.
There’s a lot of detail in the Apple blog post, and more in Douglas Stabila’s security analysis.
I am of two minds about this. On the one hand, it’s probably premature to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms. The mathematics of cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly evolving, and we’re likely to break more of them—and learn a lot in the process—over the coming few years. But if you’re going to make the switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple’s ability to do this so efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against, attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them later on future quantum computers...</span>

Whilst the director wouldn&#x27;t be drawn on what, exactly, that &quot;small element&quot; entailed or where players should be looking, Miyazaki said the team was &quot;always surprised and delighted by how much the players do discover, and how much these communities work to uncover these secrets&quot;.
Talking to IGN, Miyazaki said that whether it was up to interpretation or &quot;just further investigation&quot;, fans needed to look a little harder to find it.

In a surprise appearance at the Nier: Orchestra Concert in London earlier this month, director Taro invited fans to applaud as loudly as they could to ensure the Square Enix president – who was reportedly also in attendance – knew there was an appetite for a sequel.
According to someone there that night, &quot;the room immediately erupted into claps, cheers and yells&quot;.

                              <span>Once again, Helldivers 2 has raised its concurrent player cap, this time to 800,000 players.
Arrowhead Game Studios&#x27; CEO and Helldivers 2&#x27;s creative director Johan Pilestedt confirmed the cap had been increased over the weekend whilst thanking the &quot;studio of ~100 devs&quot; for their &quot;amazing achievement&quot;.
&quot;I&#x27;m really happy and proud of the [Arrowhead Game Studio] team for an amazing achievement, the servers handled all Helldivers 2 players this weekend without problem,&quot; Pilestedt wrote on X/Twitter, adding that now that the servers were more stable, the team would have &quot;time to focus on improvements to the title and resume [its] original plan&quot;.

                              <span>Halo co-creator and Battlefield game director Marcus Letho has left EA.
Letho – who had been heading up Seattle-based Ridgeline Games, an EA studio dedicated to the Battlefield franchise – has seemingly scrubbed all mentions of Battlefield and EA from their social media bio, as well as updated their LinkedIn to state they&#x27;ve now left EA.
As spotted by &quot;Battlefield connoisseur&quot; DANNYonPC and Insider Gaming, Ridgeline Games currently has no job openings on its careers site, and Ridgeline&#x27;s co-founder and art director, Chris Matthews, also left the studio in January 2024 to join Destiny developer Bungie as studio art director.

                              <span>Rainbow Six Siege&#x27;s creative director seemingly doesn&#x27;t have any plans for a sequel.
Talking at today&#x27;s Siege Invitational 2024 in Brazil, Alexander Karpazis said that having watched other live services games &quot;go through sequels&quot; and &quot;just completely drop the ball&quot;, the team would rather &quot;build up&quot; the fan-favourite shooter instead of making a new one.
&quot;The idea of switching engines to something that can be off-the-shelf ready simply doesn&#x27;t answer the needs of a really competitive and demanding game like Siege,&quot; Karpazis said, as transcribed by PC Gamer.

                              <span>If you like the look of Dying Light 2: Stay Human but have yet to pull the trigger, I have good news – for one weekend only, Techland is letting PC players jump into the game for free.
Showing off the &quot;Reloaded Edition&quot; in &quot;all its glory&quot;, the free trial runs from now until 6pm UK time (10am PT / 1pm ET / 7pm CET) on Monday 26th February, and includes a free welcome pack with items that will remain in your inventory should you decide to visit again.
Progress will save and carry over should you wish to pick up a copy of the game later down the line, and the Reloaded Edition - which includes the first story DLC and the highly-anticipated firearms update - is currently 50 per cent off.

                              <span>Ubisoft has teased its future plans for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, saying the acclaimed Metroidvania will be getting new content and modes in free updates starting &quot;soon&quot;.


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown enjoyed significant critical acclaim when it launched back in January - Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan called it a &quot;real delight...that revels in both its genre and its own heritage&quot; in his four star review - and while early reports have suggested it hasn&#x27;t fared quite so well commercially, Ubisoft clearly isn&#x27;t done with the title yet.


In a short video message shared on social media (as spotted by VGC), Lost Crown director Mounir Radi thanked fans for their support, saying, &quot;It means the world to us seeing you enjoy your time with the game just as much as we do. Which is why, I&#x27;m especially pleased to let you know that we are far from being done&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly preparing to launch a new white, digital-only version of its top-end Xbox Series X console in &quot;June or July&quot; this year.


An &quot;adorably all-digital&quot; Xbox Series X refresh, planned for a 2024 release, first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year&#x27;s court battle with the FTC. However, Xbox boss Phil Spencer later insisted &quot;so much has changed&quot; since the plans detailed in the leak had been drawn up, leaving the all-digital console&#x27;s future uncertain.


But now, noted leaker eXtas1s (writing for Exputer) has claimed that not only are Microsoft&#x27;s all-digital Xbox Series X plans still alive, the console is set to release &quot;sometime between the upcoming months of June and July&quot; - although &quot;chances for a slight delay&quot; remain.

                              <span>If you didn&#x27;t get chance to put No Man&#x27;s Sky through its paces during its free to play event last weekend - or if you did and you want to do it all over again, no purchase required - developer Hello Games has announced its exploratory space sim is free to download and play right now  for the next few days because it all proved so popular last time.


In its free weekend round two announcement, Hello Games says its first attempt &quot;worked better than expected&quot; and No Man&#x27;s Sky &quot;started the year with more players than we&#x27;ve EVER had at this time of year&quot;, adding, &quot;Our large and friendly community did us proud and jumped at the opportunity to welcome these new Travellers with open arms and show them the ropes.&quot;


As before, No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s free weekend is open to players on all platforms - Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - and the latest festivities conclude on Monday, 26th February. Any progress made during the event will be carried over to the full game if you&#x27;re convinced enough that you decide to make a purchase, and the previous 50 percent discount is still available across digital storefronts, meaning you can pick it up for around £19.99.

                              <span>Xbox is running a giveaway competition in collaboration with Palworld, where one lucky person can win a custom Xbox Series X and controllers featuring the titular Pals.
The giveaway was announced by Xbox over on X (née Twitter), alongside what I assume is a mock-up of the final design. 
The console features the game&#x27;s cover art and logo, while the four controllers bundled with it come in four different colours with four different Pals on: yellow (Grizzbolt), green (Mammorest), blue (Pengullet), and pink (Cattiva).

                              <span>SteamWorld Build publisher Thunderful said the game &quot;fell slightly short of expectations&quot;, as its company restructure is &quot;off to a good start&quot;.


The game was the latest in the SteamWorld series that turned to strategy and base building gameplay, and was released at the start of December last year.


During the company&#x27;s latest financial reporting, Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz put the blame on genre choice not being suited to the Switch, where the series is traditionally stronger (thanks Game Developer). That&#x27;s despite the game&#x27;s sales contributing to a record high Q4.

The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase earlier this week revealed a host of games still on the way to the Switch later this year, but the Japanese version of the showcase additionally included the Game Boy Advance game Mother 3 as part of the expansion pass.


Fans were up in arms on social media, even going as far as to pester series creator Shigesato Itoi.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has failed to meet publisher Warner Bros&#x27; expectations.
During a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said Rocksteady&#x27;s recent release had &quot;fallen short of our expectations&quot; (thanks, IGN).
The executive did not share any sales figures for Suicide Squard: Kill the Justice League during this call, but admitted it had left the company with a &quot;tough year&quot; ahead when it comes to year-on-year comparisons. Last year, Warner Bros. published Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy, the latter of which became the best selling game in the US in 2023.

                              <span>Inflexion is prioritising an offline play mode for Nightingale. This follows on from player feedback, with many questioning the developer&#x27;s decision to make Nightingale online-only on its early access release earlier this month.
In an update on Steam, the Nightingale team said its vision was always to &quot;create an interconnected series of Realms, with the idea of allowing for co-operative exploration in mind - a universe bigger than a single Realm or server&quot;. 
As such, the studio made the decision early on to support co-op from day one, rather than focus on an offline mode.

                              <span>Fortnite has begun teasing its next season - Chapter 5 Season 2 - in-game, with a series of intriguing changes. 


Meanwhile, fans peering inside of Fortnite&#x27;s files have datamined some surprising map updates set to herald the start of an Ancient Greek mythology period.


A new NPC character named Odyssey can be found just outside Risky Reels who you can chat to for an update on the current season&#x27;s storyline (which has so far been pretty threadbare) and a tease for what&#x27;s next: something to do with an ancient power named the Mosaic.

                              <span>Several months down the line from Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&#x27;s launch, fans have been discussing the game&#x27;s ending and whether elements should have played out differently.
This discussion has been prompted by the apparent emergence of an early plan for Spider-Man 2&#x27;s story shared on reddit, originating from the files stolen by hackers who targeted Insomniac Games. In that early draft, one particular plot element was different - sparking debate now on whether it was a good thing Insomniac apparently changed its mind. 
Please note, the rest of this article will contain major spoilers for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2. Please read on at your own discretion.

                              <span>Riot Games has revealed the official title for its free-to-play, 2D fighter League of Legends spin-off: 2XKO.
If you&#x27;re in any doubt, it&#x27;s pronounced how it&#x27;s spelled, Riot said over on X. Previously it had been referred to as Project L.
I&#x27;m going to assume the name is supposed to mean &quot;two KOs&quot;, given 2XKO is a 2v2 tag-based fighting game. That also means my brain will call the game 2KO rather than 2XKO. I&#x27;m starting to fear this might be a &quot;née Project L&quot; situation...

                              <span>After what has seemed like forever since its initial announcement a year ago, on Wednesday we finally got a full trailer for Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree. 

Eurogamer spoke to creator Hidetaka Miyazaki to gain some more details: it&#x27;s FromSoftware&#x27;s biggest DLC to date, is based on previous workings from George R. R. Martin, and has a developed world design that blurs the line between field areas and dungeons.


But is there more we can garner from the trailer itself? Let&#x27;s go into detail.

Crossplay, er I mean Krossplay, will be available for players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam and Epic Games Store) from 28th February. Players of the heavily criticised Nintendo Switch version of Mortal Kombat 1 will miss out on 1v1 Kombat League and Kasual matches, 1v1 private matches, and leaderboard stats across the other platforms.
On 28th February, Peacemaker will be available to play as in early access for those who&#x27;ve bought the Kombat Pack. Warner Bros. Games released a gameplay trailer for Peacemaker, where we get to see him using his helmet and its abilities in combat.

                              <span>Cult classic strategy game revival Solium Infernum is now available on Steam, as its developer League of Geeks continues to face an uncertain future. 


This new version of Solium Infernum - where you aim to claim the Infernal Throne of Hell by navigating political intrigue, military strategy and beytrayal - boasts an all-new single-player campaign and asynchronous multiplayer, alongside a visual refresh. 


But behind the scenes, its developer&#x27;s fate seems to remain uncertain. League of Geeks, previously behind the well-received strategy board game Armello, suffered layoffs in December, with around half of its 70-something team let go.

Larian&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse described plans for this official support as &quot;robust&quot;, but did not yet give an exact date for when it will arrive - other than to say it was planned for sometime this year. 


&quot;We have a system but it needs to be tested and still requires work,&quot; Douse explained, noting that the team wanted to avoid any player frustration from game updates breaking mods.

                              <span>Palworld has reached an astonishing 25m players within its first month. 
The numbers, revealed by developer Pocketpair, also confirm 15m players jumped into the action-adventure, monster-taming, survival game on Steam. The other 10m have dived in on Xbox, though Pocketpair didn&#x27;t specify how many of these were players who bought a copy of the game versus how many were playing via Xbox Game Pass. 
15m copies of Palworld sold on Steam will have made Pocketpair about $315m, which is around £250m, after taking off Valve&#x27;s 30 percent cut. That money will surely go a long way to helping Pocketpair with its $500k a month spending on servers, as well as hiring developers to no longer be &quot;overwhelmingly short of people&quot;.

                              <span>The final rundown of wrestlers playable in WWE 2K24 has now confirmed the removal of Vince McMahon and Brock Lesnar, following allegations surrounding both men surfacing last month.


Many fans had expected former WWE boss McMahon and frequent WWE champion Lesnar to be cut from the game&#x27;s playable roster as a result, despite the title&#x27;s focus on the past 40 years of Wrestlemania. Indeed, earlier this month, Lesnar was spotted by fans as having been quietly removed from artwork used on the game&#x27;s cover. 

2K published the final roster yesterday on its website via a simple blog post. 204 wrestlers will be available.

                              <span>The upcoming Cate Blanchett-fronted Borderlands film is the start of a &quot;Borderlands Cinematic Universe&quot;,  according to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford. 


Speaking with IGN about the recent Borderlands trailer, Pitchford discussed the film&#x27;s place in the video game universe, saying it &quot;lives side by side&quot;. 


&quot;Of course, the characters are there and authentic in the themes and even some of the storylines. But they&#x27;re independent storylines,&quot; Pitchford told the publication, stating the film isn&#x27;t either Borderlands 1 or 2. Rather, it is &quot;the first of the Borderlands Cinematic Universe&quot;, which means fans of the series will &quot;see some characters from some of the different parts of what you might know from the video games&quot;.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 has increased its player cap even further, ahead of what&#x27;s expected to be another busy weekend for the game&#x27;s servers.


Game director Johan Pilestedt revealed the game&#x27;s new concurrent user cap now stands at 700,000 players, via a post on X. Helldivers 2 is expected to hit this number, although he added: &quot;We believe that the wait times will be much more bearable&quot;.


Patch notes on Steam confirm the raised server cap, as well as a fix for an issue where players would get stuck in cinematics.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the reports that Nintendo Switch 2 will now launch in 2025, later than its previously-expected arrival towards the end of this year.
Nintendo itself is yet to say anything certain about its inevitable Switch successor, but its steady path towards launch has been tracked by numerous reports. Now, we discuss how this latest news unfolded, why we believe it has happened, and what this means for Nintendo across the rest of 2024.
Plus: some fun speculation on what we hope Nintendo will change for its new hardware (get rid of Joy-Con stick drift, please?) With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

This team up will see the band&#x27;s mascot Eddie arrive in the game as part of a new outfit collection, which has been inspired by various Eddie iterations over the years. These looks, which you can see in the trailer below, include The Dredge, The Doctor, The Deathslinger, and The Oni.


There are also new Iron Maiden T-shirts for Dead by Daylight&#x27;s original Survivors.

LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.
In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs...</span>

                              <span>To borrow from Game of Thrones, Minter is coming (please read that in Ned Stark&#x27;s voice). Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story - an interactive documentary experience for PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch - will release next month, on 13th March. 


Coming from Digital Eclipse, this upcoming release invites us all to take a little trip back in time, to &quot;an era of cassette tapes, photocopied zines, and README.TXT&quot;, as it tells the story of the British game designer&#x27;s career. So, expect plenty of psychedelia, radioactive sheep, mutant camels and more.  


Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story will include 42 classic games from across eight different platforms. An interactive timeline will reach all the way back to some of Minter&#x27;s earliest work on the Sinclair ZX81 and Commodore VIC-20, before heading onto projects for the Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari 800, the Atari ST line of computers and Atari&#x27;s Jaguar console of the 90s.

                              <span>Fallout: London - the upcoming fan made DLC-sized mod for Bethesda&#x27;s Fallout 4 - has added Neil Newbon to its cast.


The actor is known for many roles across the video game industry, including Karl Heisenberg in Resident Evil Village. More recently, he played Astarion in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, for which he won the award for Best Performance at last year&#x27;s Game Awards.


Newbon&#x27;s role in Fallout: London is still largely underwraps, with the mod&#x27;s developer simply stating he is part of the voice acting team, as an in-game screenshot is shared (see below).

                              <span>After a year on the market, Sony is now testing PS VR2 compatibility with PC.


This news comes courtesy of a PlayStation blog, which highlights a selection of games coming to its VR platform. 
Along with details on titles such as Zombie Army VR and The Wizards - Dark Times: Brotherhood (which is out today), Sony said it is &quot;currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5&quot;.

                              <span>After several years of silence, Little Devil Inside has resurfaced. You may need to cast your minds back to remember this one. Little Devil Inside first came to light - at least on Eurogamer - back in 2015, when the game achieved its Kickstarter funding goal, although trailers had floated about before then. 


Things then went quiet, before it popped back up in 2020 at a PlayStation 5 reveal event. The following year, we got word that Little Devil Inside would release towards the end of 2022, which evidently did not happen. 


Now, developer Neostream has re-emerged with its first Kickstarter post in four years and a new teaser for Little Devil Inside. The post reads a tad awkwardly, and I suspect it has been run through translation software before being published. However, it appears that there has been quite a lot happening behind the scenes at Neostream, with a some kind of disagreement happening between members of the development team.

                              <span>A recent patch for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has caused more issues than it fixed, fans say.
The game&#x27;s most recent patch was released yesterday, with developer Rocksteady stating it would target &quot;various crashes, progression blockers, connectivity issues and several server side improvements&quot;.
However, there are now numerous reports online of players encountering more issues than before. &quot;The recent patches screwed the game, for a lot of people,&quot; one reddit user acknowledged when another player said their copy of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League now wasn&#x27;t loading past a black screen.

                              <span>Hi-Fi Rush will skip the current Nintendo Switch and instead arrive on the console&#x27;s currently-unannounced successor. 
That&#x27;s according to a report from Insider Gaming, which states that the absence of a Switch version of the game in yesterday&#x27;s Xbox multi-platform announcement was due to it launching on Nintendo Switch 2 instead.


Whether Hi-Fi Rush could still eventually launch for the current Switch as well - perhaps at the same time? - is unclear, the report concluded.


Certainly, a launch for Hi-Fi Rush on a Nintendo platform has been expected. Earlier this year, in-game clothing designs seemed to point to the rhythm action game going multi-platform in the near future. This apparent tease preceded any other multi-platform plans being discussed publicly by Microsoft, and the decision to launch four games on other consoles ultimately being laid out this month.

                              <span>Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree will be available digitally only, even for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S exclusive physical versions.


A Shadow of the Erdtree Edition will be released, including both the base game and the DLC. However this will only be available physically on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the expansion an additional download not on the disc. PC editions are digitally only, while PS4 and Xbox One will only have the DLC as a digital extra.


The DLC, as a standalone addition, will cost £34.99 across all platforms - a significant increase from, say, Bloodborne&#x27;s The Old Hunters DLC that was £15.99 on release. This perhaps speaks to the size of Shadow of the Erdtree as much as the rising cost of games.

                              <span>Surprise! Dead Island 2 has popped up as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription, despite not being listed by Microsoft when it revealed a list of late February Xbox Game Pass titles earlier this week. 


Dead Island 2 publisher Plaion has now confirmed the news, though in a blog post noted the game was &quot;for Ultimate members&quot;. Users have noted that the game&#x27;s PC version was not added to Game Pass for PC.


The unexpected addition to Game Pass follows a free weekend of access to Dead Island 2 via Xbox&#x27;s &quot;Free Play Days&quot; promotion last week.

                              <span>Arrowhead has taken aim at those Helldivers 2 squatters who were clogging up servers by remaining in a game even when they weren&#x27;t actively playing.
A new patch for the game has implemented a function that will now boot players back to the title screen if they have been idle for 15 minutes. This is something the community has been asking for a little while now, with many players reporting long queue times to get into the game.
Other points from this latest Helldivers 2 patch include a number of crash fixes. Players should no longer get stuck in the defrosting or in the ship intro cinematic, as well.

PlayStation 5 players will be able to wishlist the game beginning tomorrow, 22nd February, ahead of its launch on Sony&#x27;s console on 30th April. 


A blog post from Microsoft tonight also confirms PlayStation dates for Pentiment (tomorrow, 22nd February) and Grounded (16th April) - the same as the dates confirmed for Switch in the Nintendo Direct earlier.

                              <span>A PlayStation 5 release date for the currently-Xbox console exclusive Hi-Fi Rush has found its way onto the internet. 

The Hi-Fi Rush PS5 launch date was today revealed to be 18th March, courtesy of a new trailer for the rhythm action game posted to Bethesda&#x27;s Latin American YouTube channel. 


That video appears to have gone live a little earlier than planned, as it was soon taken offline by Bethesda - but not before the internet noticed. You can watch it via the embed below, now re-uploaded to social media:

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced a two-month delay for Prison Architect 2, with the management sim sequel now set to release on 7th May as developer Double Eleven opts for &quot;extra time to identify more bugs and further optimise the game&quot;.


Prison Architect 2 - the sequel to the hugely popular 2015 original from developer Introversion Software (who sold the rights to Paradox in 2019) - was announced back in January, promising a take on the prison management formula reimagined in full 3D.


There was talk of some rather nifty looking multi-floor building, and a new connection system defining and impacting the relationships prisoners had with other inmates. All of that was originally due to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th March, but eager sorts will now need to wait until May following today&#x27;s delay.

                              <span>Hidetaka Miyazaki didn&#x27;t envision originating an entire genre. Yet such is the popularity of the Dark Souls games - right up to the more recent Elden Ring - that they&#x27;ve become collectively known in the gaming community as Soulslikes. That&#x27;s shorthand for games with calculating combat, high levels of challenge and repeated death, though this is of course reductive of the awe and grim majesty Miyazaki&#x27;s games evoke.


Soulslikes are everywhere now. From indie games utilising specific mechanics, to larger projects specifically trying to out-do FromSoftware at its own game. That&#x27;s testament to the influence of Miyazaki&#x27;s work, though he remains humble when discussing his oeuvre with me ahead of announcing the release of Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring&#x27;s upcoming major expansion.


&quot;We certainly didn&#x27;t come up with the term Souslike and we didn&#x27;t envision it as a new genre or a new term for the industry,&quot; he tells me. &quot;So of course when it first started cropping up... we were very surprised.

                              <span>FromSoft boss Hidetaka Miyazaki has discussed the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, and the benefits of waiting for new hardware on which to revisit the beloved PlayStation 4 classic.


&quot;It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans,&quot; Miyazaki told Eurogamer when questioned about the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, in an interview timed alongside today&#x27;s proper unveiling of the Elden Ring DLC. &quot;It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it.&quot;


But would a remake benefit from newer hardware to make the release worthwhile? FromSoftware&#x27;s Demon&#x27;s Souls, for example, was remade as a PS5 launch title after originally launching on PS3 - a double console generation leap that meant the re-release felt more significant.

The announcement comes with a new trailer you can watch below.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s February Direct Partner Showcase has come and gone. This presentation was focused around third-party games so, as expected, there was no news on any homegrown Nintendo titles or the Switch 2&#x27;s expected arrival in early 2025. However, the broadcast was still full of annoucements for games headed to Nintendo Switch from other publishers over the coming six months. Here&#x27;s a roundup of everything which appeared during the 25-minute show.
Fresh from Microsoft&#x27;s confirmation it was bringing more of its Xbox console exclusives to other platforms, the show began with a look at Obsidian&#x27;s Grounded - where you have to explore a massive garden as a tiny human. Grounded will support online cross-platform multiplayer on Switch when it&#x27;s released on 16th April.
After this, we entered the dying world of Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist. You take on the role of Lilac as she explores the landscape alongside a homunculus (Fullmetal Alchemist vibes anyone?). Ender Magnolia Bloom will be released on the Nintendo Switch later this year.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s just-finished Nintendo Direct included the surprise announcement of Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble, a new installment in Sega&#x27;s spherical simian series. 


Launching exclusively for Nintendo Switch on 25th June, this new entry in the series features an online mode where up to 16 players can rush forth simultaneously across obstacles and towards each level&#x27;s goal. It looks rather like Fall Guys!


Another big change with Banana Rumble is the addition of a Spin Dash move, which lets you charge forward and skip over short gaps. There&#x27;s a new co-op Adventure Mode, too, and the ability to customise your chimp with over 300 options.

                              <span>And just like that, my excitement for Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has gone from bubbling anticipation to a fever pitch scream; alongside a first gameplay trailer for FromSoftware&#x27;s eagerly awaited expansion, publisher Namco Bandai has now shared a release date, confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 21st June.


But first that trailer, offering a full three-minute look at Shadow of the Erdtree, and the sprawling expanses of almost inevitable death and gleefully masochistic misery within. There are fields of wheat tainted with spectral tomb stones, gloomy swamps, and striking ruins high on hills - and what gameplay reveal trailer would be complete without a tease of the imposing enemies that&#x27;ll no doubt be the cause of that aforementioned death and misery?


As for what it&#x27;s all about, well, the specifics remain something of a mystery, although Miquella - long speculated to be the focus of the expansion - while not especially prominent in this reveal (possibly because he&#x27;s currently stuck in an egg), does sort of appear, and there are further hints he&#x27;s maybe not as benevolent as some might claim. Let the lore theorising begin!

                              <span>Monster Hunter Stories, Capcom&#x27;s first - and wonderfully successful - stab at adapting the series&#x27; classic monster battling action into a family friendly turn-based RPG, is, as per today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, getting a Switch remaster sometime this &quot;summer&quot;. Seperately, Capcom has confirmed it&#x27;s coming to PS4 and PC too.


Switch owners have, of course, already had a chance to sample the Monster Hunter Stories series when its acclaimed second outing launched on Nintendo&#x27;s platform in 2021. However, Nintendo&#x27;s latest Direct has revealed the original game - first released for 3DS back in 2016 - is getting a thorough spruce-up for modern audiences.


Monster Hunter Stories 1 casts players as a Monster Rider, setting them loose in a colourful, cartoony rendition of the series&#x27; universe to indulge in some classic RPG-style questing and Pokémon-esque monster collecting, battling, and rearing - and very good it is too.

                              <span>Nintendo will add five classic Rare games to Nintendo Switch today, including SNES hit Killer Instinct and N64 great Blast Corps. 


In Japan, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will also get Mother 3 - the third entry in the legendary Earthbound series which has never made it to the West. 


All of these games were announced in this afternoon&#x27;s Nintendo Direct broadcast - though Mother 3 was only mentioned in the show&#x27;s Japanese version. Sorry, rest of the world.

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s long-rumoured announcement Microsoft is bringing four of its previously Xbox-exclusive first-party games to Switch and PlayStation 5, we&#x27;ve finally got official confirmation of the first two games making that multiplatform leap: Obsidian&#x27;s historical narrative adventure Pentiment comes to Switch tomorrow, 22nd February, while inch-high garden adventure Grounded arrives 16th April on Nintendo&#x27;s platform.


Starting with Pentiment, it cast players as Andreas Maler, a master artist who finds himself embroiled in murders, scandals, and intrigue over a period of five years in 16th century Bavaria. It&#x27;s fantastic stuff - Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan called it a &quot;brilliant narrative adventure that is filled with intelligence and heart&quot; in his Recommended review back in November 2022 - and the choice-driven adventure is paired with a striking art style, inspired by the great manuscripts and the earliest printed books of the time.


As for Grounded, Microsoft&#x27;s second Switch-bound Xbox title, it&#x27;s a wonderful co-op-imbued survival and crafting adventure with a distinctly 80s twist, taking a leaf out of cinema favourite Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. As in that movie, Grounded&#x27;s four protagonists are miniaturised and left to fend for themselves in a sprawling backyard garden, building bases and crafting armour to forge ahead against deadly bugs, fish, and other wildlife.

                              <span>Nintendo will hold its next Direct showcase today, Wednesday 20th February at 2pm UK time. 


This showcase will last around 25 minutes, and feature games coming to Nintendo Switch in the first half of 2024 from Nintendo&#x27;s publishing and development partners. Hit refresh on this page at 2pm and you will be able to watch it below!

So, what do we expect? Well, it might be easier to say what we&#x27;re not expecting to pop up here. As this is a partner Direct, don&#x27;t expect any big announcements from Nintendo itself - or from Pokémon, which has its own broadcast scheduled for next week.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has addressed lingering questions around the company stance on physical media following last year&#x27;s leaks of an &quot;adorably all-digital&quot; Xbox Series X refresh, saying Microsoft continues to be &quot;supportive&quot; of the medium, and insisting &quot;getting rid of physical, that&#x27;s not a strategic thing for us.&quot;


An all-digital (and distinctly cylindrical) new Xbox Series X design first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year&#x27;s court battle with the FTC over its Activision Blizzard acquisition plans. However, when Spencer later acknowledged the leak, he called its contents &quot;old emails and documents&quot;, insisting that &quot;so much has changed&quot;.


But still, the possibility of an all-digital new Xbox has continued to loom, whether that be a mid-cycle refresh or a future console, particularly following news of major layoffs acoss Microsoft&#x27;s games retail teams. And Spencer has now shed a little more light on Microsoft&#x27;s perspective on physical media as part of an interview for journalist Stephen Totilo&#x27;s Game File.

                              <span>Elden Ring aficionados, it&#x27;s finally almost time to unclench! Just shy of two years since the launch of FromSoftware&#x27;s magisterial open-world action-adventure, publisher Bandai Namco has confirmed it&#x27;ll be sharing more on the game&#x27;s eagerly awaited DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, later today, with early rumours pointing to a June launch.


But first the confirmed stuff; over on its social media channels, Bandai Namco has formally announced Shadow of the Erdtree will be getting a first gameplay reveal as part of a three-minute long YouTube &quot;presentation&quot; today, 21st February, at 3pm UK time/4pm CET/7am PST.


And here we enter into less substantiated territory, with reliable Deallabs leaker billbil-kun (who has an impressive track record when it comes to accurately reporting unannounced PlayStation news) claiming Shadow of the Erdtree will launch on 21st June.

                              <span>Lady Gaga is coming to Fortnite, having famously once asked what &quot;Fortnight&quot; was all about. 


Her arrival in the game marks something of a full-circle moment for the global music megastar, after her social media post in October 2019 simply asking &quot;What&#x27;s Fortnite&quot; went viral. Five years on, Lady Gaga&#x27;s account reposted her original message today with an image of her upcoming in-game character model, and the correction: &quot;*fortnite&quot;.


The image is labelled with Fortnite Festival, which is the game&#x27;s Rock Band/Guitar Hero-style rhythm game mode that launched late last year. Festival&#x27;s second season kicks off this Thursday, 22nd February, following its first season that spotlighted The Weeknd.

The photos, shared by People, both feature the Academy Award-winning Cate Blanchett - with some very enviable red hair - as infamous outlaw Lilith.
The first photo shows Lilith on her own, looking pretty close to her in-game character.

An unconfirmed number of job losses were first reported yesterday by PCGamesN. Now, the studio has confirmed &quot;the removal of a number of roles globally&quot; in a statement to Eurogamer.


Build A Rocket Boy is headquartered in Edinburgh, though also operates offices in Budapest, Montpellier and in China. The company is backed by investment from NetEase, and last month completed a further $110m funding round.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced the next wave of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass, which are set to be added to the subscription service over the tail end of February. 


This includes the excellent Tales of Arise, the epic role-playing game from Bandai Namco&#x27;s Tales studio that originally launched to a warm reception back in 2021. &quot;There are missteps and a few bumps along the way, but this soft reboot of a long-running series emerges a triumph,&quot; we wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Tales of Arise review.


Younger subscribers (or Xbox Game Pass owners with kids) will likely be keen to know that Bluey: The Video Game comes to the subscription this Thursday, 22nd February. You can explore the Heeler House and playground, plus play keepy uppy and Chattermax Chase.

                              <span>Sony is expected to launch a souped up version of the PlayStation 5 later this year, analysts have suggested.


A new CNBC report notes that there was now &quot;broad concensus in the game industry that Sony is indeed preparing a launch of a PS5 Pro in the second half of 2024,&quot; quoting Tokyo-based games analyst Serkan Toto.


However, the report cautions that Sony is unlikely to see a large uptick in PS5 sales year-on-year as a result of the Pro&#x27;s launch, and is also unlikely to cut the cost of the base PS5 model as a result. (Sony, unsurprsingly, has not commented on CNBC&#x27;s report.)

                              <span>The Need for Speed team is celebrating the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary with another year of live service content for its most recent release, Unbound.
&quot;Surprise! We&#x27;re still here,&quot; developer Criterion Games shared in a new blog post, where it detailed Need for Speed: Unbound&#x27;s year two roadmap. &quot;NFS turns 30 this year, and with that huge legacy, we couldn&#x27;t stand idle. However, this year will be a bit different from the previous one.&quot;
The studio said it hopes players will make &quot;new memories&quot; with the Need for Speed series this year, but admitted it &quot;can&#x27;t build everything everyone wants right now&quot;. What it can do, however, is work with its community to decide what the series should look like in the future.

                              <span>The clever beings at PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab know just how to keep us coming back for more. Not content with tasking us all with scrubbing Tomb Raider&#x27;s Croft Manor or the Seventh Heaven bar from Final Fantasy 7, it is now setting us the challenge of cleaning up the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K.
The PowerWash Simulator Warhammer 40K Special Pack will launch later this month, on 27th February across PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. You can see a little teaser for it in the video below.
We first heard about this Warhammer 40K DLC last year, with the studio subsequently stating we could expect it to release sometime during Q4. This evidently did not happen, but the good news is that there isn&#x27;t much longer to wait now.

                              <span>Cult 90s sci-fi film Starship Troopers has had a bit of a renaissance of late, which has been attributed to the releases of Helldivers 2 on PlayStation and PC.
According to online TV ratings tracker Television Stats, the 1997 release has seen its viewership stats, Wikipedia rank, and IMDB rank all see a significant rise over recent days.
A quick browse through social media will see several posts linking this renewed interest in Starship Troopers with the release of Helldivers 2 earlier this month, and this hasn&#x27;t passed the game director by. Sharing some stats on X showing an increase in Starship Troopers&#x27; popularity, Johan Pilestedt said: &quot;This is incredible!&quot;

The option essentially lets you try a permadeath run of the full game, which will end if main character Basim dies or commits any illegal actions (ie. killing civilians) that would normally see you kicked out of the Animus. 


Full Synchronisation Mode will become available when you install today&#x27;s patch 1.0.7 for Mirage, which launches at around 1pm UK time.

                              <span>A new Pokémon Presents digital event will broadcast next week, on Tuesday 27th January at 2pm UK time. That&#x27;s 9am Eastern or 6am Pacific.


The showcase will contain &quot;exciting news&quot;, a post on social media today teased, without going into further detail. 


We&#x27;re expecting to hear from The Pokémon Company on what the next Pokémon project to launch will likely be - and while it feels too early for a new generation of Pokémon, following 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it seems likely that some sort of game will arrive in the next 12 months.

                              <span>Microsoft announced that it caught Chinese, Russian, and Iranian hackers using its AI tools—presumably coding tools—to improve their hacking abilities.
From their report:
In collaboration with OpenAI, we are sharing threat intelligence showing detected state affiliated adversaries—tracked as Forest Blizzard, Emerald Sleet, Crimson Sandstorm, Charcoal Typhoon, and Salmon Typhoon—using LLMs to augment cyberoperations.

The only way Microsoft or OpenAI would know this would be to spy on chatbot sessions. I’m sure the terms of service—if I bothered to read them—gives them that permission. And of course it’s no surprise that Microsoft and OpenAI (and, presumably, everyone else) are spying on our usage of AI, but this confirms it...</span>

Seemingly most critically, the [Russian] government told the ECHR that any intrusion on private lives resulting from decrypting messages was “necessary” to combat terrorism in a democratic society. To back up this claim, the government pointed to a 2017 terrorist attack that was “coordinated from abroad through secret chats via Telegram.” The government claimed that a second terrorist attack that year was prevented after the government discovered it was being coordinated through Telegram chats...</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 won Game of the Year at the DICE Awards last week, and unlike at The Game Awards, the developers were actually allowed to take some time with their acceptance speech. And let it be known, Larian used that time wisely, addressing both the current state of the industry and the importance of player experience. 


When Larian&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse took to the stage, he acknowledged that while this is a &quot;really human industry&quot; it can also be very &quot;bad sometimes at showing developers what they&#x27;re worth&quot;. He then discussed the wave of layoffs that have affected so many people and game development studios over the past year.


&quot;I want you all to know that you are talented and that you matter, and that you are the future of this industry. Don&#x27;t let that flame be extinguished by our collective mistakes,&quot; Douse said. &quot;I know everyone here is scared because shit&#x27;s really fucked up.&quot;

                              <span>UPDATE 4.45pm UK: Consider me educated. I have looked into this further, and it turns out not only is Trinity the name of the military order in the rebooted Tomb Raider games, but it is also the code name for the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, which was conducted by the United States Army back in 1945. And that could be what the Tomb Raider website is referring to. Whoops! 

So, yes, the mention of Trinity on the Tomb Raider site may well be a coincidence that left the super fan in me a little too enthusiastic. Reader, I confess, I may have jumped the gun a bit here. I am going to send a message to the Tomb Raider team though and ask if they have any comment on the wording in the blog post, because my curiosity has now been piqued even more. 

The original story continues below.

                              <span>Capcom has shared a post to celebrate the eighth anniversary of Street Fighter 5, where it apologised for the game&#x27;s original state at launch.


&quot;From the beginning to the middle of the release, there were network issues, lack of content, etc... We are truly sorry for the content that did not meet the expectations of many of you,&quot; Capcom&#x27;s Japanese Street Fighter social media account shared over the weekend. 


This is something we touched on in our own Street Fighter 5 review from 2016. As we said at the time: &quot;Street Fighter 5&#x27;s brilliant combat is let down by a barebones launch and server troubles.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo shares have dropped slightly from a record high last week, following reports the company has internally delayed its expected Switch 2 release window into 2025.


Eurogamer reported last Friday that Nintendo was now looking to launch Switch 2 in early 2025, a change from previous, unannounced plans that had the new console pegged for later this year. Sources with knowledge of the delay told us it was designed to ensure the strongest possible line-up of launch games.

Bloomberg later corroborated the news via its own sources, and today noted Nintendo shares had now fallen 5.8 percent on the back of Switch 2&#x27;s delay being made public. Nintendo is yet to comment on the reports.

                              <span>A Limp Bizkit mod for Fallout: New Vegas once thought lost has now been rediscovered.
The mod in question added Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst as an in-game companion. And, of course, he brought some nu metal energy with him, as he only spoke in lyrics from the band&#x27;s discography. All very standard modding community stuff.
However, the mod had a very short shelf-life on Nexus Mods when it was first released around seven years ago, and there was very little evidence of it left online - an old Reddit post and YouTube video (which you can see below), were about all that remained.

                              <span>PlayStation-published Helldivers 2 had a hugely successful weekend on Steam, despite some continuing server issues, with a fresh player peak of 409,367 users yesterday. 


That&#x27;s a new record for Helldivers 2, according to official Steam figures, and puts the game&#x27;s all-time player peak  higher than Steam stalwarts such as GTA5, Rust and Destiny 2. 


To say that Helldivers has been a hit on PC would be something of an understatement, especially in comparison to the middling popularity of some other PlayStation PC launches.

                              <span>The Convergence mod for Elden Ring is out now, offering an &quot;exhaustive overhaul&quot; of the game.


Available on NexusMods, The Convergence makes major changes from the very beginning of the game. Now players will need to choose from one of 27 new classes - each with its own unique progression path - that will determine the player&#x27;s starting location in the world.



The original game features 10 classes, but these are starting points from which the player has freedom to develop in any direction. The Convergence, then, has a more formal structure for players to follow that cements typical builds.

                              <span>The upcoming return of Crazy Taxi will be a &quot;AAA&quot; game, Sega has said. 

Sega first announced it was making a long-awaited new Crazy Taxi title in December last year, as part of a new wave of entries in many of its classic series.


Now, a Japan Times interview has shed more light on its scope, and revealed it is being worked on in part by Sega&#x27;s relatively new Sapporo Studio, which was founded in the capital of Japan&#x27;s Hokkaido prefecture in December 2021.

                              <span>Despite claims it is a &quot;quadruple-A&quot; live-service experience, Skull and Bones&#x27;s user Metacritic score has taken a pummelling since the pirate ship game was released on Friday, 16th February.
Based on the 222 user scores recorded to date, Skull and Bones&#x27; user score is sitting at just 2.8 out of 10, making it the lowest-rated game of 2024 released thus far when ranked by user score alone.
Complaints are centred chiefly around its &quot;underwhelming and lacklustre&quot; gameplay, a &quot;poorly designed&quot; end game, and claims that it is &quot;boring&quot;, with many players comparing it unfavourably to Sea of Thieves and even Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Black Flag, the latter of which is now 11 years old.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead says it has had to &quot;cap&quot; concurrent players to around 450,000 to &quot;further improve server stability&quot;.
In a message posted to the game&#x27;s Discord community, the team said it was &quot;working around the clock to solve&quot; the issue, and whilst it&#x27;s been able to &quot;mitigate&quot; some of the causes, it was &quot;still struggling to keep up with the scaling that is needed&quot;.
&quot;Earlier tonight we had server-related issues with a concurrent player spike,&quot; the team said. &quot;This lead [sic] to some mission payouts failing, some players being kicked to their ships, or being logged out.

According to a recent Steam update – and spotted by the eagle-eyed community on the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma subreddit – an update to Steam&#x27;s backend hints that a mysterious &quot;unknown app&quot; was added to Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s Steam listing.
Furthermore, the app has been listed as &quot;free on demand&quot;, which is often the text appended to Steam demos.

                              <span>DreadXP has confirmed its upcoming retro psychological survival horror game, Heartworm, will be released in 2025.
Designed for people who &quot;love early console-era survival horror games with cinematic fixed camera angles and low-fidelity visuals&quot;, Heartworm is described as &quot;a nostalgia-wrapped nightmare with a compelling narrative that tackles themes of grief and obsession, supported by a haunting soundtrack, surreal visuals, and pre-rendered cutscenes&quot;.
Heartworm developer Vincent Adinolfi had originally hoped to release Heartworm this year, but after losing its publisher, launching a Kickstarter, cancelling a Kickstarter, and then finding a new publisher in DreadXP, Adinolfi says &quot;with the delays we have had there&#x27;s no choice but to push things back - I hope you can understand&quot;.

Following a pledge to give all players a 50 per cent XP and requisition bonus to compensate for &quot;a problem&quot; that&#x27;s giving out incorrect rewards at the end of missions, Helldivers 2&#x27;s concurrent Steam count continues to tick up, which has, in turn, seemingly had a significant impact on server stability.
&quot;Despite our best efforts to increase server capacity to accommodate all of you who want to dive for Freedom, we are experiencing capacity issues,&quot; the team said in a statement posted to X/Twitter over the weekend.

                              <span>Digital Extremes&#x27; fan-favourite sci-fi RPG, Warframe, is coming to iOS later this month.
Courtesy of the game&#x27;s recently-launched cross-play and cross-save systems, players will be able to use – and switch between – platforms, which DE says offers the &quot;same expansive, high-quality&quot; experience on Apple devices as it does on PC and consoles.
Players can access their Tenno collection across the platforms, whilst new arrivals will be able to claim &quot;Day 1&quot; login rewards.

In a statement posted to X/Twitter, deputy game director Sagar explained that whilst the team was still &quot;working on a fix for this&quot;, it wanted to &quot;alleviate the impact&quot; for players jumping into the action over the weekend.
That means that between now and the end of Sunday central European time (11pm UK time / 6pm EST / 3pm PST), players can expect an additional XP bonus on top of the base mission score.

As Palworld&#x27;s 24-hour concurrent Steam count peaks at around 535,000 players – a fair fall from the 2.1 million simultaneous players Pocketpair secured the weekend Palworld launched – community manager &quot;Bucky&quot; stated in a statement on Twitter that the &quot;Palworld has lost X per cent of its player base discourse is lazy&quot;, insisting that it was &quot;fine&quot; for players to take a break and play other games in between content updates.
&quot;This emerging &#x27;Palworld has lost X per cent of its player base&#x27; discourse is lazy, but it&#x27;s probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games,&quot; Bucky said.

As first reported in the Irish Examiner, minister for foreign affairs, or Tánaiste, Michéal Martin – who raised the issue in the Dáil, the Irish government – revealed that 136 of the approximately 200 jobs in Blackpool, Cork, were expected to be cut, calling the redundancies &quot;very serious&quot;.

                              <span>Over 700 unionised Ubisoft employees working across the company&#x27;s French studios have taken part in an organised day of strike action after annual salary negotiations collapsed.


The strike, organised by French game workers union STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo), took place on 14th February across Ubisoft&#x27;s Paris, Montpellier, Annecy, Lyon, and Bordeaux studios. The STJV had called for action at the start of this month, saying annual salary negotiations had reached an unsatisfactory conclusion.


&quot;In recent weeks,&quot; the STJV wrote in a statement shared at the time, &quot;Mandatory Annual Negotiations on salaries have taken place in several Ubisoft entities in France, and the STJV was obviously present. Despite concerted efforts by union organisations to find an acceptable compromise, negotiations hit a wall.&quot;

                              <span>A report claiming Nintendo Switch 2 will now launch in Q1 2025 is spreading online. 


Brazilian games journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe has stated Nintendo is now looking to release its next console in early 2025, though still within the 2024 financial year. The report is based on development sources now targeting that quarter for launch.


Eurogamer has heard similar whispers of an early 2025 launch from industry sources this week, though has not been able to concretely substantiate them. Nintendo Switch 2 had previously been widely tipped to arrive later this year. A move to the other side of Christmas into early 2025 would mean more time for the console&#x27;s launch line-up to be readied, while keeping the financial benefit of Switch 2&#x27;s launch within Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming financial calendar.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair has acknowledged the significant impact &quot;cheating and the influence of fraudulent activities&quot; is having on rule-abiding players of its hugely popular survival game, and has outlined some of the steps it&#x27;ll be taking - including the introduction of an &quot;external anti-cheat solution&quot; - to tackle the problem.


Writing in a post shared on Steam, Pocketpair admitted that, while the studio has been &quot;dealing with each issue on a daily basis and taking measures&quot;, there are &quot;many cases where we are not able to keep up&quot; with cheating and fraudulent activities - leading, it acknowledged, to &quot;some players [being] unable to play the game properly.&quot;


Pocketpair apologised for &quot;any inconvenience this may cause&quot; and - expanding on a recent tweet promising a cheating-related patch &quot;soon&quot; - revealed it&#x27;s currently working on a number of specific measures to deal with cheating and fraudulent activity &quot;strictly and as a priority&quot;.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft&#x27;s business update that brought us confirmation Xbox will launch four console exclusives - for now - on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.
But why did Microsoft choose not to name those four games (even though Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Grounded and Sea of Thieves were immediately reported to be the titles in question)? What happened to the previously-reported plans to include larger games such as Starfield? And where will Microsoft draw the line for what to launch elsewhere? Right now, these four feel like something of a soft launch for Microsoft&#x27;s multiplatform strategy, 
As well as all that, we also discuss the news nuggets Microsoft dropped for the Xbox faithful - including mention of new Xbox console hardware this year and the proper next-gen Xbox that&#x27;s still years away. With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>One of the three upcoming Star Wars games in development at Apex Legends and Titanfall studio Respawn is reportedly a bounty hunter game where you play as a Mandalorian. 


That&#x27;s according to Insider Gaming, which said the project was still in the early stages of development, but was a first-person shooter starring a Mandalorian bounty hunter during the time of the Galactic Empire.


The report stops short of confirming the Mandalorian bounty hunter as Din Djarin, star of Disney+ hit TV series and upcoming Mandalorian movie. A time period set during the height of the Galactic Empire would also place the game prior to the TV series - making a Baby Yoda appearance unlikely.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed it cancelled development of &quot;at least&quot; five projects following a review to implement &quot;stricter standards&quot; and an &quot;emphasis on quality&quot; in its upcoming games.
The information comes from the company&#x27;s latest financial report for Q3 of FY2024, which  contained changes to its projections of profits and sales for the full fiscal year.
The Tekken 8 and Elden Ring publisher lowered its projections for profits due to &quot;valuation losses&quot;. These losses include &quot;loss on disposal of titles following a review of the composition of the titles within the next mid-term plan in mind&quot;, the company stated in its report.

The store&#x27;s launch will also herald the return of Fortnite to iPhones, years after its previous version was locked down after Epic Games added the abililty to make direct in-game payments, circumventing Apple&#x27;s standard 33 percent cut.


Epic said today it planned to launch the Epic Games Store on iOS in 2024, operated by Epic Games Sweden.

Patch 6 has been teased by Larian Studios since last week, when we learned it would include more kissing animations and easier party management, but we didn&#x27;t know when it would be rolling out - or everything else it would contain.
Well, the update is now live, and with it comes the usual delight of patch notes a la Larian, which are too lengthy to be contained in Steam&#x27;s character limit (of course).

XProger is the brains behind OpenLara, an open-source cross-platform engine of the classic Tomb Raider series. However, this project and others are now on hold, as XProger was scooped up by Aspyr&#x27;s parent company Saber Interactive to work on its official Tomb Raider project.


&quot;For the past year I&#x27;ve been busy with a dream project that has become the culmination of the last eight years of my life - Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered,&quot; XProger shared on X, thanking Saber for &quot;trusting me to lead the project and assemble a dream team of true fans&quot;.

                              <span>Payday 3 will finally be getting an offline mode - although we don&#x27;t know exactly when.
Payday 3 hasn&#x27;t exactly had the best of launches. It was plagued with matchmaking issues and online-only requirements on release, and subsequent patches were delayed. All this lead to developer Starbreeze admitting that sales and player activity were lower than it had hoped, but it would endeavour to turn this around with a series of prioritised improvements.
Now, we know more about what these upcoming improvements will be, thanks to the reveal of Operation Medic Bag. Here, the developer announced that an offline mode is coming to Payday 3, as well an overhaul to matchmaking (Starbreeze admitted that right now, &quot;matchmaking isn&#x27;t doing a good job of bringing people together&quot;), tweaks to the UI, a solo mode and a quickplay option. Additionally, &quot;challenges will be removed&quot;, with the developer stating it will &quot;switch infamy progression to be tied to heist completion&quot;.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestedt is hoping the game&#x27;s second weekend will go much smoother than its first.
In a thread posted on X, Pilestedt reflected on the changes developer Arrowhead Game Studios has made since Helldivers 2 released to huge success on 8th February for PC and PlayStation 5.
&quot;I am completely exhausted by the success,&quot; he stated, but &quot;very, very pleased.&quot;

                              <span>As Microsoft opts to launch at least some of its Xbox exclusives on rival consoles, the company&#x27;s gaming boss Phil Spencer has reflected on Sony&#x27;s recent, hugely-successful launch of online, cross-platform shooter Helldivers 2 on PC and PlayStation 5.


&quot;I will say, when I look at a game like Helldivers 2 - and it&#x27;s a great game, kudos to the team shipping on PC and PlayStation - I&#x27;m not exactly sure who it helps in the industry by not being on Xbox,&quot; Spencer told Game File. &quot;If you try to twist yourself to say, like, somehow that benefited somebody somewhere.


&quot;But I get it. There&#x27;s a legacy in console gaming that we&#x27;re going to benefit by shipping games and not putting them on other places. We do the same thing.&quot;

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is developer Remedy&#x27;s fastest-selling game to date, but the studio is still to recuperate the project&#x27;s development and marketing costs. 


In its latest financial report, Remedy said Alan Wake 2 had now sold 1.3m units, with 1m of those occurring by the end of last year. This equates to 50 percent more copies and over three times more digital copies of Alan Wake 2 sold in the game&#x27;s first two months than its previous release Control managed in its first four months (though it&#x27;s worth noting Alan Wake 2 was a digital-only release).


Control has since gone on to sell over 4m units, and Remedy said it expected a similar trend with Alan Wake 2, as &quot;a great game can generate excellent long tail sales&quot;. But, of course, games lose value over time - so copies sold after prices drop generate less revenue than at launch.

                              <span>Microsoft has shared updated Game Pass membership figures for the first time since January 2022, saying the on-demand gaming service now has 34m &quot;fully paid&quot; subscribers, with &quot;significant growth&quot; coming from PC and cloud.


That update comes via Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer, speaking to journalist Stephen Totilo for his Game File newsletter (thanks VGC) ahead of this week&#x27;s hotly anticipated Xbox &#x27;business update&#x27; podcast - in which the company finally discussed its much rumoured plans to bring a number of its formerly Xbox-exclusive first-party games to PS5 and Switch.


Discussing Microsoft&#x27;s latest Game Pass figures, Spencer assured Totilo the 9m subscribers added to the service since January 2022 - when Microsoft announced Game Pass had amassed a total of 25m members - were &quot;fully paid&quot; and did not include promotional players. &quot;Those are people,&quot; Spencer reiterated, &quot;fully paid subs.&quot;

That&#x27;s according to Xbox president Sarah Bond, who was speaking on an &quot;Updates on the Xbox Business&quot; edition of the Official Xbox Podcast, alongside Microsoft Gaming boss Phill Spencer and head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty.


According to Bond, Microsoft has hardware plans for Xbox in both the short and longer term. Starting this &quot;holiday&quot;, for instance, Microsoft will share &quot;some exciting stuff coming out in hardware&quot;. An official Xbox tweet accompanying today&#x27;s podcast expanded on Bond&#x27;s comments, saying Microsoft currently has a &quot;robust and innovative multi-year hardware roadmap&quot; that&#x27;ll include &quot;more console and controller options...this holiday.

                              <span>Following mounting reports Xbox is preparing for some kind of multiplatform future, Microsoft has confirmed it&#x27;ll be bringing four previously Xbox-exclusive first-party titles to PlayStation 5 and Switch later this year, with more likely to come in the future.


Reports that Microsoft was preparing to release a number of first-party games on competing consoles - namely Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush - first surfaced at the start of this year, but it wasn&#x27;t until last week&#x27;s claims high-profile exclusives such as Starfield and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would also be going multiplatform that Microsoft broke its silence, promising to reveal more in a podcast this week.


And now, as reported by The Verge - which was pre-briefed by Microsoft ahead of tonight&#x27;s reveal - Xbox gaming boss Phil Spencer has confirmed the company has &quot;made the decision that we&#x27;re going to take four games to the other consoles&quot;. Bafflingly, Spencer does not name the games directly, only saying two are community-driven titles and two are smaller games.

                              <span>Welcome to our live coverage of the big Xbox business update, where Microsoft laid out its plan to launch four first-party Xbox games on Nintendo and PlayStation platforms. 


Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer, Xbox president Sarah Bond and head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty - the company&#x27;s Triforce of gaming top brass - stopped short of officially confirming the quartet of titles set to go multiplatform, but reports online suggest those titles will be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves and Grounded.

The podcast also included a brief mention of new Xbox hardware launching later this year, and a tease for the proper next-gen Xbox - you can read all of that below.

                              <span>Post-apocalyptic RPG fans are in luck; the next batch of freebies coming to the Epic Games Store have been revealed, and two bonafide RPG classes - Fallout and Fallout 2 - have made the list alongside Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel.


Fallout 1 and 2, developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997 and 1998 respectively, have amassed a fiercely passionate following over the years, and with good reason. &quot;From the unrelentingly bleak, darkly ironic tone to the novelty of the open-world, post-apocalyptic setting,&quot; Eurogamer wrote in 2011, &quot;from the inspired, cerebral turn-based combat system to the immense degree of variety and personality in the character-customisation, the superbly-written quests and characters and the gallows humour that underpins the games without lessening their emotional impact, even the well-placed, gritty violence; there&#x27;s very little about the games that doesn&#x27;t command as much respect now as they did a decade ago.&quot;


As for Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, released in 2001, it&#x27;s less widely revered, but still a decently enjoyable time, infusing the post-apocalyptic isometric wasteland setting of its illustrious RPG predecessors with squad-based combat action. And its inclusion means next week&#x27;s Epic Games Store freebies list is as follows:

                              <span>A quarter of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM&#x27;s total workforce - approximately 24 employees - is reportedly facing redundancy following the cancellation of a standalone expansion for acclaimed RPG Disco Elysium, said to be &quot;one to two years away from completion&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to Swedish gaming content agency GLHF, which claims the cancelled expansion - codenamed X7 - was the third project to have either been canned or paused indefinitely by ZA/UM in as many years. A Disco Elysium sequel was reportedly cancelled in 2022 (complicating the claim, ZA/UM CEO was still talking about the project in June 2023, albeit saying it had been &quot;jeopardised&quot; following a messy tussle with its former creative leads), while a new sci-fi IP is said to have been paused in 2023.


GLHF, citing &quot;sources close to the matter&quot;, says 24 employees at ZA/UM are now at risk of redundancy following X7&#x27;s cancellation, with the job losses mostly affecting &quot;the X7 team but also [its] non-development teams and non-X7 projects.&quot; Redundancies are set to impact employees in ZA/UM&#x27;s UK offices as well as its EU studio, with writers, engineers, artists, animators, and staff in production and IT all affected.

                              <span>When Forever Skies leaves PC early access later this year, it will also arrive on PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive.


Developer Far From Home has been &quot;secretly&quot; working alongside Sony for several years on its rather intriguing looking game of airships and survival. While the Forever Skies team is yet to set a date for this release, merely stating it will be some time in 2024, it has promised a same day launch for both PC and PS5. 


Along with this news, the studio has shared a new trailer for Forever Skies, showing off the latest in-game footage. You can have a watch for yourself below.

                              <span>Xbox has rolled out a new update for February, adding touch controls in remote play and more.
With this update in action, users will be able to play games without being tied to their console even if they don&#x27;t have a wireless controller to hand. This is as Xbox remote play now supports custom touch control layouts on the Xbox app (via iOS, Android and Windows devices) for over 100 games.
&quot;The same custom touch layouts available through Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) will now be available when remotely playing games from your personal console,&quot; Microsoft said. &quot;This includes games like Minecraft Dungeons, Psychonauts 2, Sea of Thieves, and many more. Additionally, a basic touch control layout can now be used for most other games.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s been fairly quiet on the No Man&#x27;s Sky front since its previous big update, Echoes, introduced the world to a mysterious new robot race known as the Autophages last August, but all that changes today with the release of its new Omega update - which coincides with a first-ever free weekend for the exploratory space sim on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.


No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Omega update introduces a handful of new core features, including on-planet missions. These procedurally generated quests can be initiated by speaking to alien lifeforms Travellers find roaming around on planet surfaces, and are assembled based on a number of factors, including locale, climate, and alien personality.


Elsewhere, the update makes it possible to captain an imposing Dreadnought capital ship - previously they existed mainly to be blown up - but this first requires a spot of successful space combat; players will need to defeat the pirate freighters surrounding a hostile Dreadnought during an encounter before they&#x27;re able to board it and take control.

                              <span>Making good on their word, People Can Fly and Incuvo have released a rather chunky patch for Bulletstorm VR on PlayStation VR2 and Steam VR. This follows an earlier update on Meta Quest sets, which took aim at crashes and more.
Bulletstorm VR had a broken release earlier this year, with players complaining about the port&#x27;s botched physics and censorship, among other issues. Back in January, the team subsequently said it was &quot;committed to improving the quality&quot; of its release, and would be prioritising fixes based on their severity.
This new patch will provide fixes for multiple crashes and bugs, as well as improving the AI on select enemies. Other quality of life improvements, such as holding down the trigger to automatically skip a cinematic, have also been added.

                              <span>Following a rocky launch, Payday 3 developer Starbreeze said its sales and player activity are &quot;currently at significantly lower levels than [it] would like&quot;. However, the studio hopes to turn this around in the future, stating it will focus efforts &quot;to ensure that the game lives up to expectations&quot; for players.  
The developer noted there have been other examples of games that have successfully turned a &quot;problematic initial time on the market&quot; into a &quot;long-term success&quot; story. While Starbreeze did not mention any names, Cyberpunk 2077 came to my mind.
&quot;There is no simple recipe available, but a common thread from the positive examples is to take players&#x27; criticism to heart, dare to support your game and keeping an open and honest dialogue with your stakeholders,&quot; Starbreeze said in its year-end report. &quot;That is exactly what we are now doing with Payday 3.&quot;

The game&#x27;s creative director and Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt responded to a fan requesting the addition of a PvP mode to keep &quot;hardcore gamers engaged&quot;.


&quot;We&#x27;ll &#x27;never&#x27; add a PvP-mode. This is to reduce toxic elements from the community,&quot; said Pilestedt. &quot;We want an environment that&#x27;s supportive, fun and where we all are fighting on the same side!&quot;

These words come ahead of Microsoft&#x27;s business update later today, in which the company is expected to lay out its plans to publish some Xbox games on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms.


Bond was speaking at an internal town hall meeting, with several sources telling Inverse the exec went on to discuss Xbox&#x27;s strategy of existing on multiple devices. She also spoke more on the company&#x27;s ambitions to become the number one cross-platform gaming company, the sources said. 


To illustrate this point, staff were shown images of this year&#x27;s breakout hit Palworld across multiple screens. This included &quot;tablets, TV screens, monitors, and handheld devices&quot;, the publication said.

The company released its latest financial report today, stating its net sales increased by 4 percent, though this is largely thanks to its Tabletop Games and Entertainment divisions. PC and console games net sales decreased by five percent.


In its third quarter, the company laid off 483 people, meaning 1387 employees have now lost their jobs in the last two quarters, representing 8 percent of the total workforce.

                              <span>A report by the French video game workers union has raised concerns from staff at Life is Strange and Vampyr developer Don&#x27;t Nod.


Headquarted in Paris, the company released action role-player Banishers: Ghosts of Eden this week, following last year&#x27;s  well-received Jusant and Harmony: The Fall of Reverie.


Now, a report by French union Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV) has alleged that staff at Don&#x27;t Nod are subject to mismanagement by the company due to the need to balance multiple projects with &quot;frequently&quot; changing deadlines, &quot;contradictory&quot; directions and &quot;no long-term vision&quot; for staff welfare.

                              <span>Sony president and PlayStation chairman Hiroki Totoki has spoken of the opportunities available in its approach to releasing first-party games on PC, saying it&#x27;s &quot;proactively [working] on&quot; bringing more titles to other platforms as part of an &quot;aggressive&quot; profit margin growth plan. 


Totoki made the comments during an investor Q&amp;A coinciding with its latest financial earnings report. When asked how Sony&#x27;s gaming division might be looking to increase profits, he first discussed the difficulty of cost reduction in PlayStation hardware, given component pricing, before highlighting a &quot;multiplatform&quot; approach to its first-party game releases as a potentially more fruitful area of expansion.


&quot;In the past, as you all know,&quot; Totoki explained, &quot;we wanted to popularise [our] console, and the first-party title&#x27;s main purpose was to make the console popular.&quot;

Despite some early technical woes, which Arrowhead has been hard at work trying resolve since Friday&#x27;s release on PlayStation 5 and PC, Helldivers 2 has enjoyed a positive critical reception and strong player numbers, even becoming PlayStation Studios&#x27; biggest Steam launch to date as it amassed over 150,000 concurrents this weekend.


Amid that early success, Arrowhead CEO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt has taken to social media on a recruitment drive, seeking out &quot;more amazing developers&quot; who can &quot;help [the studio] accelerate and beef up our content plans&quot;.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company is bringing its hugely popular Pokémon Center pop-up store back to London for four days this April, with promise of more exclusive Pokémon merchandise.


The Pokémon Center&#x27;s return to the UK coincides with this year&#x27;s Pokémon Europe International Championships, which take place at ExCeL London from 4th to 7th April. The store will be open at the venue from 10am to 8pm every day except Sunday, when it&#x27;s set to close at 4pm.


Previous Pokémon Center pop-ups in the UK have attracted huge crowds, and The Pokémon Company is clearly expecting similar attention this time around. It notes that while entry to the store is open to the general public and won&#x27;t require a competitor or spectator badge, reservations are mandatory - even for badged attendees. More information on the reservation process is set to be shared &quot;closer to the event&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has unveiled its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game catalogue additions for February, which this month include Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, Need for Speed Unbound, The Outer Worlds, Tales of Arise, and more.


Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is arguably the biggest biggie in there, whisking players away for a Viking adventure set against an open-world backdrop of Anglo-Saxon England at the end of the ninth century. A lavishly designed &quot;saga for the ages&quot;, is what Eurogamer called it back in 2020.


Valhalla is joined by the developer Criterion&#x27;s equally recommended arcade racer Need for Speed Unbound - the &quot;best Need for Speed in a generation&quot; we said when it released in 2022 - as well as Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s slightly less gripping 2019 satirical adventure The Outer Worlds, a &quot;conventional, easygoing scifi RPG...that fades very quickly from the mind.&quot; And here&#x27;s the full list of February&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Extra games.

                              <span>Good essay on software bloat and the insecurities it causes.
The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge attack surface full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic fails, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile, great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take security more seriously...</span>

                              <span>The Sims 4 has partnered with model Winnie Harlow and added a range of Vitiligo skin details to the game as part of a free update. 


Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. This is caused by a lack of melanin, the pigment in skin. Sims 4 players will now be able to customise their Sims with Vitiligo skin details, with patches for the face, upper torso, lower torso, arms, and legs now available in the Create-A-Sim menu. 


These details are available for Sims of all ages, from infants to elders. Several Vitiligo patterns will have &quot;more than one variant&quot;, the Sims team said, calling skin details an &quot;important area of focus for the dev team as we remain committed to expanding representation in The Sims 4&quot;. Other skin features already in the game include birthmarks, stretch marks, scars, and freckles.

That means no new entry in the God of War or Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man franchises until at least April 2025, according to Sony president Hiroki Totoki. 


Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, currently listed with a vague &quot;2025&quot; release date, will therefore launch later than March. Don&#x27;t expect to see other big PlayStation properties such as Uncharted, The Last of Us, Ratchet &amp; Clank or Horizon before then, either. It&#x27;s also unclear where a potential Ghost of Tsushima sequel fits in.

Due some point this week, Larian already let us know the patch will add new idle animations for party members in camp and improve smooches  (just in time for Valentine&#x27;s Day).
In a new thread on X, Larian revealed Patch 6 has &quot;more than just romance&quot; and will add bug fixes and some gameplay improvements which should help make party management much easier.

                              <span>Sony had a record quarter for PlayStation sales and revenue, but expects console sales to decline in the next fiscal year.


According to its latest financial report, Sony sold a further 8.2m PlayStation 5 consoles, bringing its lifetime total to 54.7m. That&#x27;s 16.4m consoles sold this financial year so far.


However, Sony has dropped its expected sales forecast across its gaming segment for the year by five percent, due to an expected decrease in hardware sales and increase in losses due to promotions.

                              <span>Bloober Team&#x27;s CEO has said he understands the critism around the recent Silent Hill 2 Remake trailer, which didn&#x27;t &quot;capture the spirit of the game&quot;.
The trailer in question was a combat-focused marketing beat by publisher Konami, and as Matt said at the time, combat is not exactly the first thing you think of when you think of Silent Hill 2. It probably isn&#x27;t even the second or third. And yet, this was what Konami decided to hone in on during PlayStation&#x27;s recent State of Play.
However, reactions afterwards weren&#x27;t exactly enthusiastic. &quot;The nurse vaulting over the wall like it&#x27;s a tactical shooter is hilarious,&quot; one comment under the original trailer reads. Another remarked the game looks more like it&#x27;s from 2014, than 2024. Others said it looked more like a fan-made remake.

                              <span>Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered begins with a content warning that explains the trilogy contains &quot;offensive depictions of people and cultures rooted in racial and ethnic prejudices&quot;. 


The message states that these depictions are &quot;inexcusable&quot; but have been kept intact to acknowledge their &quot;deeply harmful&quot; inclusion and learn from it.


There&#x27;s no detail in the statement on which specific elements of the games it refers to - though one likely example can be found in Tomb Raider 3, Eurogamer fans of the games tell me, where stereotypical South Pacific islanders attack Lara Croft with bows and arrows.

                              <span>The winner of the Best Paper Award at Crypto this year was a significant improvement to lattice-based cryptanalysis.
This is important, because a bunch of NIST’s post-quantum options base their security on lattice problems.
I worry about standardizing on post-quantum algorithms too quickly. We are still learning a lot about the security of these systems, and this paper is an example of that learning.

But—and this is the real reason I am posting this—Amazon has significantly discounted the hardcover to $15 to get rid of its stock. This is much cheaper than I am selling it for, and cheaper even than the paperback. So if you’ve been waiting for a price drop, this is your chance.</span>

                              <span>Arceus, the god Pokémon, won&#x27;t turn up in Pokémon Go for this month&#x27;s upcoming Go Tour: Sinnoh. 


Its apparent absence had been hotly debated by fans, though has now been confirmed to Eurogamer by developer Niantic. It means Go Tour: Sinnoh will be the first one of Pokémon Go&#x27;s popular annual Tour events not to let players complete their Pokédex for the corresponding region.


Two other Sinnoh species will also be absent: Mythical creatures Manaphy and Phione.

The BS F-Zero Grand Prix games were first made available in a series of broadcasts in 1996 and 1997, including remixed courses from the original SNES game and some exclusive tracks too.


However, these games appeared to be lost in the mute city of time - until now.

                              <span>A mobile version of hit survival horror Lethal Company has popped up on the iPhone App Store and Google Play - but isn&#x27;t what it seems. The game&#x27;s developer Zeekerss has warned players this is &quot;likely a scam of some sort&quot;, and not made with its permission.


Lethal Company has become incredibly popular since its debut last year, and prompted praise for the game&#x27;s mix of genuine horror and almost slapstick comedy. Now, it appears others are trying to profit off Zeekerss&#x27; success by releasing their own rip-off of Lethal Company on mobile. Don&#x27;t be fooled.


Writing on the Lethal Company Discord, a moderator stated this mobile version &quot;was made with no explicit permission and is most likely a scam&quot;. They asked users to refrain from linking to any fake games, to avoid anyone falling foul of &quot;devious and malicious intentions that may be behind that operation&quot;.

Benard originally shared his sentiments on the end of Dead Cells development via the game&#x27;s Discord server, where he said the official statement from Motion Twin was &quot;total marketing bullshit&quot; from a company he called &quot;greedy&quot;. 
Now, Benard has shared an update with further thoughts on his blog, in a bid to shed more light on his previous words.

That&#x27;s according to a new report from The Verge ahead of Thursday&#x27;s podcast from Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer, Xbox president Sarah Bond and head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty, where the trio will reveal Xbox&#x27;s new business strategy - including, it&#x27;s believed, the launch of exclusive games on rival platforms.



Sources confirmed to The Verge that Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment will be the first two games on the way, with Sea of Thieves planned for later this year. Other first-party titles are simply described as being under consideration.

                              <span>The Thaumaturge will now launch slightly later than planned, on 4th March, despite work on the game being complete. 


Writing on social media today, publisher 11 Bit Studios said it had actively chosen to delay the game due to &quot;February&#x27;s busy launch period&quot;. This month&#x27;s releases include Ubisoft&#x27;s Skull and Bones (on the 16th) and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (on the 29th). 


&quot;The game is complete, but we want to give it space so it can be enjoyed the way we believe it deserves,&quot; the publisher wrote in a post on X. &quot;See you in 1905 Warsaw and thank you for your patience!&quot;

                              <span>Molly White—of “Web3 is Going Just Great” fame—reviews Chris Dixon’s blockchain solutions book: Read Write Own:
In fact, throughout the entire book, Dixon fails to identify a single blockchain project that has successfully provided a non-speculative service at any kind of scale. The closest he ever comes is when he speaks of how “for decades, technologists have dreamed of building a grassroots internet access provider”. He describes one project that “got further than anyone else”: Helium. He’s right, as long as you ignore the fact that Helium was providing LoRaWAN, not Internet, that by the time he was writing his book Helium hotspots had long since passed the phase where they might generate even enough tokens for their operators to merely break even, and that the network was pulling in somewhere around $1,150 in usage fees a month despite the company being valued at $1.2 billion. Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have been accused of hoarding the project’s token to enrich themselves. But hey, a16z sunk millions into Helium (a fact Dixon never mentions), so might as well try to drum up some new interest!...</span>

                              <span>You may not know his name, but Richard Wells is one of the most-heard voices in video games - and now he&#x27;s blowing up on TikTok.


Wells&#x27; TikTok account, which he created last Friday, now has over 17m views - mostly on his first video, where he reveals himself as the voice of video gaming&#x27;s PEGI logos.


Yes, Wells voiced the &quot;PEGI 12&quot; and &quot;PEGI 18&quot; logos that play before video game trailers - and now, he&#x27;s told fans he was only paid €200 (£170) years ago to do it.

                              <span>Former lead designer and developer on Dead Cells Sébastien Benard has called the decision to end development on the game &quot;the worst imaginable asshole move&quot; by publisher Motion Twin.
Benard worked on Dead Cells until late 2019, before establishing his own one-man studio called Deepnight. Now, he&#x27;s posted his thoughts on Dead Cells&#x27; development being ended on the game&#x27;s Discord server, after being asked for his opinion (as spotted by PCGamesN).
After a quick check by Eurogamer, Benard&#x27;s posts no longer seem to be available on the server at the time of writing, though many users are still discussing what he wrote.

Rocksteady became aware of the bug when players began reaching Mastery Levels during the postgame &quot;beyond our wildest expectations&quot;, the developer said on the Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Discord server.
&quot;As Mastery levels increased, Burn&#x27;s damage also increased,&quot; Rocksteady explained, adding this was not &quot;what the game was balanced for at launch&quot;. The developer is fixing the scaling bug, it said, and once the fix is in place a new leaderboard will begin.

Responding to a Doctor Who fan via Instagram, Davies said of the long-expected Fortnite tie-in: &quot;There isn&#x27;t one! It&#x27;s a complete myth, I&#x27;m afraid.&quot;


The news has come as a surprise to many Fortnite fans expecting David Tennant and current TARDIS incumbent Ncuti Gatwa to both stroll into Fortnite&#x27;s metaverse sometime in the near future.

                              <span>The demo for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has been out a week and, beyond sharing piano covers, now players are arguing about yellow paint.


It&#x27;s a familiar trope in many video games: essentially, developers indicate the correct path by adding bright yellow paint to scalable ledges and ladders.


It&#x27;s also a debate that has raged for years. When the Resident Evil 4 remake demo was released, players complained about yellow paint being used on breakable objects. Now the discourse has erupted again.

The sentiment was relayed in a note posted on Steam following server maintenance yesterday, in which the developer released three &quot;rapid-fixes&quot;. The issues addressed during maintenance were related to logins, server capacity, and progression and rewards.
However, the issues haven&#x27;t been fully resolved and Arrowhead said it is &quot;doing our utmost to make it right&quot;. &quot;In order to do so,&quot; the studio added, &quot;right now it is crucial that our team gets some sleep and we will be back at this again in a few hours&quot;.

&quot;We really applied ourselves to not make it [pay-to-win] even though items are functionally different,&quot; Pilestedt said (thanks, PCGN). &quot;The only item that&#x27;s [pay-to-win] is the revolver – which will win you any &#x27;cool gun&#x27; competition.

In a candid blog, the team insisted it had &quot;heard [the] feedback&quot; from players about the competitive play over the last eight seasons, and has plans to introduce &quot;big updates&quot; to enable you to better build on your skills and &quot;see how you progress through the competitive ranks&quot;.
&quot;We built a better system that’s more accurate while also helping convey the meaning behind the mathematical complexity of a modern matchmaker and bring clear insights about what impacts your rank in every match,&quot; the team said.

                              <span>Viral co-op horror Lethal Company may only have released in early access in late October 2023, but it&#x27;s already received almost 50 updates.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, developer Zeekerss says it is thinking of slowing down the rate and scope of updates in order to make them &quot;really substantial&quot; and &quot;bigger and less frequent&quot;.
In a message posted to X/Twitter, Zeekerss – pointing out that the co-op horror game is currently 30 per cent off – admitted that they were &quot;distracted by life right now&quot;, but version 50 was &quot;slowly cooking&quot;.

                              <span>The Little Mermaid&#x27;s Ariel has stopped by Disney Speedstorm, the hero-based combat racing game inspired by Disney and Pixar worlds.
Season 6, entitled Under the Sea, includes &quot;brand-new content&quot; inspired by Disney&#x27;s The Little Mermaid. As well as a new track based on the fan-favourite animated movie, Ariel, Ursula, King Triton, and Prince Eric – plus bonus racer EVE – are all new racers that each bring &quot;their own unique and powerful abilities&quot; to the line-up.
That&#x27;s not all, though. If you can&#x27;t bear the thought of being under the sea without Ariel&#x27;s friends, Flounder, Sebastian, Max, Flotsam and Jetsam, and even Scuttle are available as new crew members, too.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch 2 will be backwards compatible.
That&#x27;s according to Universo Nintendo, a Portuguese website that claims the Switch 2 will not only have backwards compatibility with Switch titles currently available on Nintendo&#x27;s handheld system, but developers will also be able to &quot;enhance&quot; these games thanks to the additional processing power.
The report – which hails from the Portuguese podcast X do Controle by PH Brazil and was shared across social media by Centro Leaks – further asserts that rumours about a Nintendo Direct coming next week are indeed true, and claims that we&#x27;ll finally have confirmation about Nintendo&#x27;s badly-kept secret system at a hardware reveal event sometimes in March.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is now Playstation&#x27;s biggest Steam launch, clocking up over 150,000 concurrent users on the PC platform over the weekend.
Until this point, Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War reboot held the record with 73,529 simultaneous users, which is less than half of Helldiver 2&#x27;s current peak of 155,926.
The record was secured despite the issues that plagued the shooter&#x27;s launch, which was causing crashes and preventing some players from matchmaking with others.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has confirmed that the &quot;rapid patch&quot; the team deployed to Steam yesterday is &quot;now on PS5 as well&quot;.
The update comes after players lamented issues with matchmaking, as well as persistent crashes. There&#x27;s also been criticism of the game&#x27;s PC optimisation and its kernel-level GameGuard anti-cheat software, whilst others have taken umbrage with Helldivers 2&#x27;s monetisation.
However, game director Mikael Eriksson did admit earlier today on the game&#x27;s Discord channel that whilst &quot;a full matchmaking solution is in works&quot;, it may take &quot;a few more days&quot; to test before it can be rolled out.

                              <span>Tekken 8&#x27;s upcoming DLC characters have reportedly leaked online.
A dataminer who sifted through the game files of the fighting game claims to have uncovered the names of some of those who are appearing on the DLC roster.
Dataminer Shootmans says they &quot;confirmed and debunked several leaks&quot; during the Closed Network Test, and attests that their most recent exploration has revealed who may be coming back for the DLC.

It seems questions about the progress of the eagerly-anticipated DLC were anticipated, as this latest update was included in the FAQ section of the firm&#x27;s latest financial report.
Tucked in between questions about net sales for Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon (&quot;we do not disclose sales results and forecasts for individual titles&quot;) and &quot;the trend of pricing per unit for paper-based books&quot;, the company said that whilst work continued on Elden Ring&#x27;s DLC, it was unable to provide a release date just yet.

                              <span>A new report claims Nintendo Switch 2 is expected later this year and will feature a custom-made Nvidia chip.
According to Reuters, Nvidia is building an entirely new business unit to focus on designing bespoke chips for hardware firms and has designed a custom design for the next iteration of Nintendo&#x27;s handheld system.
A source told Reuters that &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia&#x27;s Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox is still committed to making consoles, says boss Phil Spencer
Earlier this week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer called an all-staff townhall meeting to address the rumours suggesting that hitherto first-party Xbox games could be released on other platforms, insisting that this did not mean the company wasn&#x27;t committed to the Xbox console.
According to journalist Shannon Liao, the meeting – which was held with all internal staff on Tuesday – confirmed that the company was indeed considering bringing first-party games to &quot;multiple kinds of devices&quot;, and more would be revealed publicly next week.

                              <span>Palworld creator Pocketpair has acknowledged it is &quot;overwhelmingly short&quot; of developers to help the viral hit maintain momentum.
In a tweet posted to the company&#x27;s Japanese-language X/Twitter account, the studio said it &quot;still has a lot to do&quot; and is looking for &quot;people in all positions&quot; who have experience in &quot;any type of engine&quot;. Specifically, however, Pocketpair would like to talk to devs with expertise in project planning and engineering.
&quot;At Palworld, we still have a lot to do, but we are overwhelmingly short of people to join us!&quot; the studio said, as translated by PC Gamer. &quot;We are looking for people for all positions, but we are especially looking for planning and engineers!

                              <span>Hideo Kojima dropped a bombshell at the end of January, announcing that - alongside development of Death Stranding 2 - he would also be returning to the action-espionage genre that put him on the map with the Metal Gear series, in the form of Physint for PlayStation 5. And now, in a new episode of his HideoTube web series, the designer has explained how a period of sickness and surgery - and thoughts of his own mortality - convinced him to &#x27;change his priorities&#x27; and do something fans had been asking him to do for years.


During the hour-long episode (thanks GameSpot), Kojima explained how, after departing Konami and establishing his independent Kojima Productions studio, he &quot;wanted to do something new with my own IP&quot; and &quot;challenge myself&quot;, leading to Death Stranding. &quot;Then, to create a franchise,&quot; he continued, &quot;I made Death Stranding 2. And I wanted to do something even newer, so I started working on OD. And since then, there have been a lot of new ideas.&quot;


However, Kojima revealed that during those eight years, &quot;Every day on social media, from users all around the world, people have been asking me to create another Metal Gear and stuff like that.&quot; But it wasn&#x27;t until he became ill in 2020, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, that those requests began to take on a more significant meaning.

                              <span>GTA 5 will soon pass the astonishing milestone of having sold 200m copies.


The game currently sits on 195m copies sold to date, with more than five million copies shifted over the past three months, publisher Take-Two revealed in its latest financial results. 


If its current momentum continues, GTA 5 will pass the 200m mark before the summer. That&#x27;s around 100m more copies sold than Tetris, and behind only Minecraft (which has sold around 300m copies, it&#x27;s believed).

                              <span>Pikachu stars in the music video for Jax Jones&#x27; new single Never Be Lonely.
The single, which features German singer-songwriter Zoe Wees, was released today and accompanied by a music video. The video is a collaboration between Jones and The Pokémon Company International, and sees Pikachu being abducted onto a UFO-turned-stadium where Jones and Wees are performing.
Pikachu isn&#x27;t that mad about being abducted though, as he happily greets the two and dances along before illuminating (or rather electrocuting) the entire stadium. Ceruledge also makes a sneaky appearance towards the beginning of the video, as a projection onto the sides of some buildings.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s live-service pirate ship game Skull and Bones is a &quot;quadruple-A&quot; project, company boss Yves Guillemot has said. 


Discussing the long-awaited project with investors last night, Guillemot justified the live service game launching with a £70 price tag as it being a fully-formed experience that was also supported by a battle pass, premium currency and an in-game store.


&quot;You will see that Skull and Bones is a full-fledged game,&quot; Guillemot said. &quot;It&#x27;s a very big game and we feel that people will really see how vast and complete that game is. So it&#x27;s a really full triple-A, quadruple-A game that will deliver in the long run.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth players are already sharing piano covers from the game&#x27;s demo, just days after its release.



The demo takes place in Nibelheim where, as Cloud, players can snoop around in Tifa&#x27;s house and play her piano - fans of the original will remember this is how you unlock her ultimate limit break.


Now, in Rebirth, the piano is freely playable in a little minigame, so players have been busy creating covers of Final Fantasy tunes and pop songs.

                              <span>The next game from Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has been delayed slightly.
No Rest for the Wicked, an isometric action-RPG with darker visuals, is a departure from the Ori games. It was revealed in December at The Game Awards, and the developer gave an early access release window on Steam of the first three months of 2024. 
However, the game&#x27;s early access launch has now been delayed to Q1 of the financial year 2025 (or Q2 of the calendar year 2024), as revealed in Take-Two&#x27;s earning report for Q3 2024.

Nexus VR isn&#x27;t mentioned at all in Ubisoft&#x27;s Q3 earnings press release, but the game was addressed by Guillemot during its conference call (as reported by VGC).

In-game calendar pages posted around the game&#x27;s Metropolis map have been spotted by Batman Arkham Videos, and verified by Eurogamer. Each features a circled date, with a hidden code that spells out a secret message.


Substituting the date marked on each calendar page (the eighth of January, for example) with the corresponding letter of the alphabet (H, the eighth letter) spells out the following phrase:  &quot;He Will Return&quot;.

While specific sales have not been noted in its latest report, games released in the last quarter include Sonic Superstars, Persona 5 Tactica, Total War: Pharaoh, and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.


However, its latest releases suggest a more positive quarter is on the horizon, despite the company lowering its forecast.

During the earnings call with investors, Zelnick said Take-Two is &quot;currently working on a significant cost reduction program&quot;. A similar cost reduction program was announced by Take-Two in its third quarter report for 2023, which resulted in some layoffs last year.

                              <span>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot believes the launch of GTA 6 will be &quot;positive for the market&quot; and expects it to launch after April 2025.


Take-Two itself has provided a release window of 2025, but Guillemot expects it &quot;closer to our financial year &#x27;26 than our financial year &#x27;25&quot;.


Whenever GTA 6 releases, Guillemot said it will be good for the industry when questioned during the company&#x27;s Q3 earnings call yesterday.

                              <span>A fresh set of weekly freebies has now arrived on the Epic Games Store, this time in the form of acclaimed visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! and rogue-like brawling RPG Lost Castle - with Dakar Desert Racing to follow next week.


Starting with Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!, it&#x27;s the enhanced and expanded version of developer Team Salvato renowned 2017 freeware visual novel of the same name (minus the &#x27;Plus!&#x27; bit, obviously) that starts out innocently enough - with players taking on the role of a new student who can romance the anime-styled members of the titular club - before taking a metatextual turn into considerably darker territory.


If that&#x27;s not your thing - and its Epic Games Store listing makes it clear Doki Doki isn&#x27;t &quot;suitable for children or those who are easily disturbed&quot; - your other freebie option is Lost Castle. This is a &quot;super cute, super hard action RPG with roguelike elements and randomised dungeons&quot; from Hunter Studio, and it supports four-player co-op and PvP both locally and online.

                              <span>Satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 has got off to a solid start on Steam, with today&#x27;s launch propelling it to the number three position on the platform&#x27;s best-sellers list, while its concurrent players have hit over 64,000 in less than a day. However, player reception has been mixed thanks to a range of issues on PC (it&#x27;s also out on PS5), and developer Arrowhead Game Studios has now responded, saying fixes are on the way.


Helldivers 2 - which follows the same co-op template as its well-received predecessor, albeit with a switch from top-down perspective to third-person - has so far settled on a Steam rating of &quot;mixed&quot; after over 5,300 reviews, with players highlighting a range of launch-day woes.


Chief among criticisms are complaints about persistent crashes, while others have singled out server and matchmaking issues. Then there&#x27;s ire directed towards PC optimisation, and its kernel-level GameGuard anti-cheat software, which some feel is cause for concern, as well as complaints around Helldivers 2&#x27;s monetisation - which includes a battle pass and premium currency in-game shop, despite the game&#x27;s £34.99/$39.99 USD price tag.

                              <span>Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds has moved to address fan concerns following publisher Krafton&#x27;s announcement that the underwater survival sequel will be a multiplayer title adopting a &quot;game-as-a-service model&quot;.


Krafton made the claims in its latest financial earnings report, which also brought the news Subnautica 2 - the third game in Unknown Worlds&#x27; series, following on from the acclaimed 2018 original and its 2021 continuation Subnautica: Below Zero - would be out this year. And with fans beginning to express displeasure at the apparent swerve away from the solo, self-contained survival action of previous Subnautica games, Unknown Worlds quickly sprung into action, offering clarification on its blog.


Starting with the multiplayer announcement, that much is apparently true, with Subnautica 2 confirmed to be playable co-operatively with up to four players. However, Unknown Worlds stresses the sequel &quot;is not multiplayer-focused&quot;, and that co-op is &quot;entirely optional&quot;, with players also able to play the game entirely solo if they choose.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red - which takes the long-running series to feudal Japan - will launch before the end of Ubisoft&#x27;s current financial year next March, CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed, with the publisher&#x27;s open-world Star Wars Outlaws still targeting a release in 2024.


Guillemot shared the news as part of Ubisoft&#x27;s latest earnings results - for the third quarter of fiscal 2023-24 - in which he touted a &quot;very promising line-up&quot; for the year to come. That line-up includes a 2024 release for Massive Entertainment&#x27;s highly anticipated Star Wars Outlaws, suggesting Ubisoft isn&#x27;t expecting any further slippage after it was reportedly delayed out of the publisher&#x27;s current fiscal year - ending 31st March 2024 - and into the next.


The bigger news, though, is confirmation that Ubisoft&#x27;s next blockbuster-sized Assassin&#x27;s Creed game - currently only known as Codename Red, despite confirmation of its feudal Japan setting - will be coming in fiscal year 2025, meaning a release before 31st March next year. Historically, the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise has avoided the spring launch window, suggesting Red could also be targeting 2024 - as previously reported - unless Ubisoft is breaking with tradition.

                              <span>In Nexus Mods&#x27; words: &quot;A beast of monstrous proportions is approaching.&quot; Today, the mod distribution site - home to some of the best community made video game additions (looking at you Shrek and Thomas) - will hit 10bn downloads.
To put that milestone into some perspective, &quot;if every download were a footstep, you could walk to the moon 11 times, or walk The Seven Thousand Steps to High Hrothgar 4,161,464 times,&quot; Nexus Mods said.
Meanwhile, if you are more like me and find it easier to envision things with pizza slices, if Nexus Mods celebrated each download with a slice of thick crust Margherita with extra cheese, &quot;this pizza would cover 15 times the size of Manhattan Island&quot;. These are facts you simply knead to know to appreciate how monumental this milestone really is.

                              <span>Turn 10 Studios has released an initial outline of the changes it&#x27;s making to car progression in Forza Motorsport.
The progression system has been heavily criticised by players since Forza Motorsport released in October 2023, and has been a frequent topic of discussion on the Forza Forums suggestions board.
The new changes are &quot;thanks to your feedback&quot;, Turn 10 said in its Forza Motorsport car progression update announcement.

                              <span>A re-release of the 90s point-and-click Discworld game &quot;may happen&quot;, designer Gregg Barnett has teased. However, the developer said because of the way intellectual property rights work in the UK, 50 percent of the game currently belongs to the crown, which complicates matters a tad.


Discworld was originally released in 1995, having been created with input from Discworld novels author Terry Pratchett. On its launch, the game was well-received, with many complimenting its humour. It became a classic of its time, and a source of many fond memories. I can still recall the voice of Eric Idle&#x27;s Rincewind perfectly.
A sequel then followed in the form of Discworld 2: Missing Presumed...!? in 1996, before Discworld Noir arrived in 1999.

                              <span>Artisan Studios has announced a new hand-painted RPG, with visuals and music from Final Fantasy veterans.


Lost Hellden is a new Japanese RPG that appears to be taking quite a traditional approach.


Hitoshi Sakimoto (who composed the scores for Final Fantasy 12, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Tactics Ogre among others) is providing music and audio direction, while Takeshi Oga (Gravity Rush, Siren, Final Fantasy 11 and 14) is providing illustrations.

That&#x27;s according to a fresh account with further details on the fallout from Activision&#x27;s now-legendary ousting of West and Zampella, as published on LinkedIn by lead designer Paul Sandler (spotted by PC Gamer). 


Sandler writes that he was told about the loss of West and Zampella by a fellow employee who rode a scooter around the Infinity Ward office, sharing the news. &quot;I just sat there in stunned silence with my eyes wide open,&quot; Sandler wrote. &quot;I stood up from my chair and said: &#x27;What the fuck? ...Why?&#x27;&quot;

Writing on the Deus Ex reddit, Toufexis - who also plays Sam Coe in Starfield - said he wanted to share his gratitude with the series&#x27; community. &quot;I wanted to come on here and say thank you for this page, your wonderful messages over the years, and your continued, unbelievably strong support,&quot; the actor said.
&quot;As for Jensen, we say goodbye, but hopefully not farewell. Maybe someone else will buy the licence. Maybe we&#x27;ll make an animated series or finish the game. Elon Musk is a big fan, I think he has some money. Someone ask him!&quot;

These people are part of the wider round of layoffs Microsoft is undertaking, which will see 1900 employees across Xbox and Activision Blizzard lose their jobs.
The layoffs at Toys for Bob are much higher than previously estimated - a report from two weeks ago claimed between 30 to 40 percent of jobs would be affected, which was estimated to be around 35 people.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has said the recent spate of layoffs at Microsoft &quot;contradict&quot; what was presented in the antitrust trial over the company&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
In a letter submitted to a US Federal Appeals Court yesterday - first spotted by The Verge - the FTC argued the company&#x27;s layoff plan differs from how Microsoft represented itself in court proceedings ahead of the merger&#x27;s closure last year.
&quot;Microsoft represented to this Court that &#x27;the post-merger company will be structured and operated in a way that would readily enable Microsoft to divest any or all of the Activision businesses as robust market participants in the unlikely event that such a divestiture is ordered&#x27;,&quot; FTC counsel Imad D. Abyad wrote.

                              <span>Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games have said that virtual currencies within games are &quot;fictions created by game publishers&quot; during a lawsuit which alleges that money is effectively stolen from players when games are shut down. 


The lawsuit, originally filed in November by a Californian minor and his mother, alleges that Take-Two is guilty of civil theft and unfair business practicies for closing down servers for various NBA 2K, WWE 2K and PGA Tour 2K titles, causing players to lose access to any remaining in-game funds they have paid for.


&quot;VC [virtual currency] is not plaintiff&#x27;s property,&quot; a Take-Two lawyer stated this week, as reported by Game File. &quot;Instead, in-game VC are fictions created by game publishers, subject to the publishers’ terms of service and user agreements.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a fan of The Sims and Sims-like experiences, it’s quite an exciting time; The Sims 5, or whatever it’ll be called, is slowly fomenting over at EA, then there’s the imminent release of Paradox’s Life By You following a number of delays, and even the charmingly lo-fi Tiny Life for old-school Sims fans. Perhaps the game that’s generated the most excitement since its unveiling back in 2019 is Paralives, and after a long old wait - and five years of crowdfunding support - developer Paralives Studio has announced it&#x27;ll be entering early access next year.


That bit of information comes via Paralives new live mode gameplay video - live mode in Sims parlance is the bit where digital chracters actively go about their daily business, as opposed to the customisation-focused build mode - which focuses of the life of Anisa as she moves into a new apartment and begins to get to know the neighbourhood and her new neighbours.


There&#x27;s a look at how a Para&#x27;s personality can be created - initially by raising or lowering their physique, mind, creativity, and charisma attributes, as well as adding a &quot;vibe&quot;, social perk, talent, and through various lifestyle toggles - and after that it&#x27;s time to go outside.

Along with this new mode, players can also expect some new suits for the two Spider-Men and &quot;more&quot; when the update goes live.

                              <span>Over on Lawfare, Jim Dempsey published a really interesting proposal for software liability: “Standard for Software Liability: Focus on the Product for Liability, Focus on the Process for Safe Harbor.”
Section 1 of this paper sets the stage by briefly describing the problem to be solved. Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty, negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3 explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the product—­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE Corporation under a government contract. Section 6 considers how to define flaws above the minimum floor and how to limit that liability with a safe harbor...</span>

The eighth game in the series is more experimental than others, in particular with its Junction system used to boost the stats of player characters.

                              <span>PC and PlayStation 5 versions of game creation platform Dreams were previously in development, it&#x27;s been claimed.

Back in 2020, Eurogamer was told by developer Media Molecule that Dreams already ran on PS5, though this version was part of the studio simply &quot;exploring&quot; the hardware. Separately, Eurogamer had heard of the game&#x27;s PC port being in development, alongside other Sony projects that have released on PC over the years.

While the exact number of those impacted by these recent layoffs remains unclear, the studio&#x27;s former art manager Brad Bowling said he and a &quot;group of very talented developers&quot; were affected. &quot;The games industry bloodletting continues,&quot; Bowling wrote on LinkedIn.
Software engineer Sydney F. is another known to be laid off from Visual Concepts Austin this month. &quot;It&#x27;s definitely rough,&quot; she wrote, stating she is one of &quot;several other amazing colleagues&quot; to have been affected by the studio cuts. &quot;I will miss all of those that I worked with greatly.&quot;

&quot;Grab your guns and brace yourself for a chaotic race to the top,&quot; the Counter-Strike 2 team implored. &quot;Work your way up to the knife stage and earn the final kill to secure the win. Go! Go! Go!&quot;


This mode also comes with two maps, known as &quot;Baggage&quot; and &quot;Shoots&quot;, for players to blast their way around. These are reworked versions of the maps that appeared in CS:GO. Baggage - which is set in an airport bagging handling facility - even has player-operated controls for the conveyer belts in the level.

In addition to this life saving fix, the studio has also addressed game crashes that would corrupt save data when the number of Pals captured by the guild reached approximately 7000. It noted following its previous patch, &quot;save data that had already been in this state (for servers, the server&#x27;s world data) remained in a broken state that made it impossible to load&quot;. However, this latest Palworld patch will resolve that.
Pocketpair has also implemented a variety of countermeasures against some cheats and exploits, but it has not gone into specifics.

                              <span>High-profile wrestler Brock Lesnar has been removed from WWE 2K24&#x27;s special edition box art, following the publication of a lawsuit regarding disgraced former WWE boss Vince McMahon.


The lawsuit alleges McMahon sexually assaulted and sex trafficked an employee while running WWE, and claims an unnamed wrestler then requested an explicit video of the victim from McMahon during a contract renegotiation. 


The Wall Street Journal has said that wrestler is Lesnar. McMahon has denied the allegations in the lawsuit. Lesnar has not responded to requests for comment.

                              <span>If your nights spent kingly (or queenly) crusading have been growing a little stale of late, Paradox Interactive would like you to know there&#x27;s a busy year ahead for its acclaimed medieval grand strategy game, with its newly revealed 2024 Crusader Kings 3 roadmap promising two new large-scale expansions and more to freshen up that sandbox.


2024 marks the start of what Paradox is calling Crusader Kings 3: Chapter 3, which includes the aforementioned two expansions - Legends of the Dead and Roads to Power - plus the Wandering Nobles event pack, and the Couture of the Capets cosmetic clothing DLC.


Legends of the Dead is up first, falling under the banner of what Paradox likes to call a Core Expansion - which is to say, sizeable but not quite as sizeable as Crusader Kings 3&#x27;s Major Expansions. Legends of the Dead is, as its name suggests, primarily concerned with legends, giving players the means to raise their renown and strengthen the legitimacy of their rule by either commissioning an epic tale of their general awesomeness - which can then be usefully spread around the place - or by actually going out and doing some heroic deeds themselves.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training“:
Abstract: Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety...</span>

                              <span>Square Enix will review its development system to improve the quality of its games, company president Takashi Kiryu has announced.


Kiryu&#x27;s comments were made during Square Enix&#x27;s latest financial results briefing, Bloomberg reported, during which he indicated a policy of reducing outsourced development and focusing on large-scale games developed in-house, with the aim of boosting both the quality of games and profit margins.


The new system is set to be announced in spring, with multiple sources at the conference call stating it will be in effect in April. That would align with the company&#x27;s new financial year.

                              <span>Valiant Hearts: Coming Home looks to be making its way to consoles in the future. 


The First World War Ubisoft sequel was previously exclusive to Netflix on mobile, having been announced during 2022&#x27;s Game Awards. However, this exclusivity may be over soon, as a post by Brazil&#x27;s ratings board (spotted by VGC) has the game listed for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. 


Valiant Hearts: Coming Home is described as a &quot;dramatic narrative game&quot; by Ubisoft, and sees players following the interweaving stories of James, Anna, Ernst and George. Walt (the first game&#x27;s canine companion) returns in the sequel to help players work their way through these stories, which include themes of friendship, survival and sacrifice &quot;amidst the turmoil and tragedy of war&quot;.

Pokémon streamer SBCoop shared the response from Twitch on X, formerly Twitter, showing the emote in question. It&#x27;s just a little Bonsly on its back crying with a hole in its base, isn&#x27;t it?

                              <span>Henry Cavill has hung up the long white locks of The Witcher&#x27;s Geralt, and is now ready for his next foray into the gaming adaptation sphere with Warhammer, calling it the &quot;greatest privilege&quot; of his career.
Back in 2022, the actor signed a deal with Amazon to bring Warhammer 40,000 to our television screens. Even before this deal, Cavill was known to be famously into Warhammer 40,000, often talking about it in interviews. He once even corrected Graham Norton during an interview when the host mistakenly called Warhammer World of Warcraft.
Cavill&#x27;s long-time love for Warhammer is apparent even further thanks to a recent interview with Josh Horowitz (thanks, PC Gamer). When asked about the upcoming Warhammer 40,000 project, Cavill said it was the &quot;greatest privilege of [his] professional career&quot; to have this opportunity.

                              <span>Tencent is developing an Elden Ring mobile game, according to a new report.

The company acquired the licensing rights to Elden Ring from owner FromSoftware in 2022, Reuters reports, and a team was put together to work on a prototype. Sources say development on the project has been &quot;slow&quot;.
Tencent is reportedly seeking to turn its Elden Ring mobile version as a free-to-play title with in-app purchases, like Genshin Impact.

                              <span>Nintendo remains tight-lipped on the widely-expected launch of Switch 2 this year - except to say that its current Switch hardware would remain its &quot;main business&quot; heading into the year. 


In an investor call today, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the company would lay out its plan for the coming financial year at its next earnings briefing, expected in May (thanks, Bloomberg).


For now, Nintendo reported a rosy set of results, with better-than-estimated numbers for Switch sales and overall profit. The current Nintendo Switch now stands at 139m sold - around 38m more than the Wii.

These are Resident Evil 3 (2020), PlateUp! and Madden NFL 24 via EA Play.
These leaks come from the ever-reliable billbil-kun of Deallabs, which has a track record of being accurate when it comes to this sort of thing. It is likely that Microsoft itself will release the full list either later today or very soon. We will update you when we know more.

The trailer description, meanwhile, reads: &quot;Uncover the opening chapter of the game&#x27;s story and explore the world map.&quot;

Valve&#x27;s latest Steam Next Fest is already underway and runs until Monday, 12th February. That means you&#x27;ve got approximately 160 hours to piledrive your way through everything on offer - which, given the magnitude of the task, is probably a literal impossibility at this point. But then we live in a world where someone finished Dark Souls 3 with a banana, so what do I know.


As usual, Valve has tried to make the whole Sisyphean challenge a little less daunting by sorting all those playable demos into easily perusable categories on its Steam Next Fest landing page. And while you&#x27;re there, you can also take in some of the &quot;hours&quot; of developer livestreams running across the week, as if you didn&#x27;t already have enough to be getting on with.

                              <span>Following a day of reports pointing to a potentially seismic shift in Microsoft&#x27;s approach to its first-party games, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has confirmed the company will be sharing its &quot;vision for the future of Xbox&quot; in a &quot;business event&quot; next week.


All this began earlier this year, when reports surfaced that Microsoft could be preparing to release Tango Gameworks&#x27; acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush on PlayStation and Switch - a rumour that was rapidly followed by claims Rare&#x27;s multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves is also readying for release on competing consoles. However, reports began snowballing this weekend, with Starfield, Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and even Gears of War all emerging as candidates for a potential PlayStation release.


As the rumours of Xbox first-party titles going multiplatform have steadily escalated, Microsoft has remained silent, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer has now - following a dramatic day of reports from numerous reliable sources - taken to social media to announce that Xbox will be outlining its future plans in an official &quot;business update event&quot; coming next week.

                              <span>Amid a fresh swirl of reports suggesting Microsoft is at least mulling a dramatic shift in strategy for its first-party Xbox titles, it&#x27;s been claimed Gears of War - a series that&#x27;s long been tightly intertwined with Xbox&#x27;s identity - is also being considered for a PlayStation release.


That&#x27;s according to Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb, who made the claim in the latest edition of his Game Mess Mornings podcast (thanks VGC). Addressing the recent spate of rumours about first-party Xbox games heading to PlayStation - which so far include Starfield, Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, and Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming Indiana Jones game - Grubb said, &quot;The other one that I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s definitely under consideration...is Gears of War&quot;.


&quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s going to happen,&quot; he added, &quot;but it&#x27;s in talks&quot;.

                              <span>Roblox is today introducing a new AI feature that will translate a user&#x27;s real-time text into other languages. Following this, the Roblox team has plans for a feature which will translate voices into different languages with the use of its AI tech.

As reported by Reuters, sources said the game had been in development for almost two years. There was reportedly a playable internal demo, which showed some of the game&#x27;s combat and story.
The company is said to have &quot;struggled to find a compelling monestisation model&quot; to offset the high costs of the mobile entry.

XboxEra&#x27;s Nick Baker and Jon Clarke said they both had received &quot;evidence&quot; that Sony has ideas to remake the first Uncharted game from the &quot;ground up&quot;. 


&quot;It is worth saying that the additional detail I got was that this was, this was quite old - like I am talking a number of years,&quot; Clarke warned. &quot;But it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me, right... as a way to bring the series back into the limelight again and get people hyped.&quot;

                              <span>Major Xbox console exclusives such as Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield and the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are being considered for launch on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5, as part of a huge shift in strategy by Microsoft. 


Previous reports suggested Xbox would bring a handful of smaller titles to PlayStation beginning this year, including Hi-Fi Rush - something Eurogamer understood to be true and also which has now seemingly been confirmed by its in-game files. But the idea that Microsoft will also - at some point - drop exclusivity for some of its biggest games marks a policy change far bigger than previously expected. 


A swathe of reports emerged last night suggesting Microsoft&#x27;s PlayStation plans now included Starfield - Xbox&#x27;s tentpole release for 2023, albeit one which received a somewhat mixed reception - and potentially also Indiana Jones - the company&#x27;s biggest release currently on the calendar for 2024.

Confirmation came via co-game director Anthony Newman, who revealed during in the fantastic behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, that for the first four or five months of development, The Last of Us Part 2 was a &quot;purely melee focussed&quot; game that &quot;kept getting bigger and bigger as you explored&quot;, as inspired by FromSoft&#x27;s fan-favourite adventure.
&quot;When we started out making The Last of Us Part 2, Neil actually wanted to be very ambitious about changing the game almost entirely,&quot; explained Newman.

                              <span>Pocketpair is spending around half a million dollars a month – that&#x27;s around £378,000 – to keep its sleeper-hit Palworld&#x27;s servers online.
In a tweet, Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe posted a snippet of how the cost of servers have changed since the game launched just a few short weeks ago, joking – I hope, anyway – that the studio could &quot;go bankrupt from server fees&quot;.
Not that that kind of cost is prohibitive, apparently; Palworld network engineer Chujo Hiroto replied to their boss&#x27; message, revealing to the world that they&#x27;d been instructed to &quot;never let the service go down no matter what&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to notable leaker Dusk Golem, who – whilst not without a couple of misses – has previously accurately leaked insider information about several then-unannounced horror games, including Resident Evil 8, the Silent Hill 2 Remake, and Silent Hill: The Short Message.
As spotted by the eagle-eyed members of the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, Dusk Golem reportedly made the announcement on Discord.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has confirmed it will re-stock the infamous Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat card in a bid to defeat scalpers that sold the free card for hundreds of pounds.
The card was initially a free add-on for Pokémon customers, given out at a rate of one card for each item in the Van Gogh collection bought, but scalpers descended onto the store in droves, wiped out the supply, and then immediately put their wares on internet auction sites at grossly inflated prices.
Shortly after, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam confirmed it will not be restocking its promotional Pokémon card following &quot;safety and security concerns&quot; for its staff and customers, and we learned just last month that four employees of the museum in Amsterdam were eventually suspended for misconduct.

                              <span>The voice actor who played Abby in The Last of Us Part 2 has revealed that not only did she receive abusive messages when the game was released, but abusers also sent death threats about her infant son, too.
Talking in the fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, Laura Bailey confirmed that the &quot;real hardcore death threats&quot; were so concerning, they were passed on to police, whilst her baby son – who was &quot;born during all of it&quot; – also received threats, too.
The threats – sent because the fictional character she played did something to another fictional character that a subset of so-called fans didn&#x27;t like – became so serious that she even had to turn some over to the police to ensure her safety.

                              <span>EA has apologised to FC 24 fans after a bugged challenge accidentally awarded thousands of players an incredibly expensive and hard-to-get TOTY player.
According to a blog posted on the official website, it seems that for 24 minutes on 30th January, players partaking in the new Squad Builder Challenges (SBC) had a spectacularly high chance of securing the 86+ OVR untradeable Lionel Messi card worth hundreds of pounds.
EA was notified of the issue and pulled the challenge within half an hour, but it was already too late; thousands of players had already snagged it, leading those  who had not been so lucky to call for EA to level the playing field – literally and metaphorically – and gift the card to all.

That&#x27;s according to one of five short documentaries Konami published on YouTube the night it shadow-dropped The Short Message.
In the fourth video, a level designer who worked on the highly-anticipated (and long rumoured) playable teaser revealed that Konami had originally reached out to the team at Hexadrive – a studio that had primarily worked on porting older games until it helped an internal Konami team develop The Short Message – &quot;about potentially porting the Silent Hill series&quot;.

                              <span>The upcoming free-to-play skateboard sim, Skate, will be available on PC via Steam.
The news was confirmed by lead creative writer Cuz Parry, who revealed that the fan-favourite skating game would be coming to PC via Steam for the very first time in a Q&amp;A video posted to YouTube just a couple of days before the holidays.
As PC Gamer points out, the news went largely unnoticed at the time, so it was only when the social media team confirmed it was &quot;stoked to announce Skate will be available on Steam for PC players&quot; earlier this week that news began to spread.

                              <span>Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann says he has a &quot;concept&quot; ready for a third and final chapter of The Last of Us series.
Talking at the very end of the fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, Druckmann acknowledged that whilst he didn&#x27;t yet have a story fully fleshed out, he did have a kernel of an idea that &quot;is as exciting as [The Last of Us Part 1]&quot;.
&quot;If we never get to do it again, this is a fine ending point. The last bite of the apple, the story&#x27;s done,&quot; Druckmann said.

That&#x27;s according to podcaster Moore&#x27;s Law is Dead, who stated earlier this week that Microsoft was &quot;seriously, seriously shopping around with Intel and even NVIDIA apparently for their next-gen console&quot;.
&quot;As of one month ago, no next-gen contract with AMD had been signed with Microsoft,&quot; they said.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bit of bad news if, like us, you were quietly hoping Citizen Sleeper 2 might just squeak out before the end of 2024; developer Jump Over The Age has confirmed there&#x27;s still &quot;around a year left of development&quot; on its eagerly anticipated narrative sci-fi RPG sequel. 


Jump Over The Age - AKA developer Gareth Damian Martin - announced they were working on a follow-up to the hugely well-received Citizen Sleeper back in June last year. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, as the sequel is known, introduces a brand-new Sleeper android protagonist in a new setting where players will need to build themselves a life among the stars, piloting their own ramshackle stolen ship populated by a crew they&#x27;ve recruited themselves.


An update in August gave us a first look at a new location in Citizen Sleeper 2 - a bustling way station known as Hexport - as well as confirmation it&#x27;ll be releasing for PC via both Game Pass and Steam. What we didn&#x27;t get, though, was any hint of  an ETA for Citizen Sleeper 2 - and that&#x27;s where Jump Over The Age&#x27;s lastest update comes in.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced another delay for its ambitious Sims-like Life By You, which is now due to enter Steam and Epic Games Store early access on 4th June.


Life By You, the first game from Paradox&#x27;s Tectonic studio (headed up by former Sims boss and Second Life CEO Rod Humble), was officially unveiled last March, promising a game that would let players &quot;create humans and live out their lives without loading screens&quot;.


It is, essentially, the Sims, albeit with a few key selling points intended to differentiate it from the current iteration of EA&#x27;s juggernaut franchise: it&#x27;s fully open-world with no loading screens, it features &quot;real language conversation&quot;, its digital human can optionally be controlled directly in first-person, and &quot;everything is customisable&quot;. It also sports a more realistic art style compared to the Sims 4, which, last year at least, unfortunately looked both drab and bland.

O&#x27;Hara, whose expansive career includes playing eccentric matriarch Moira Rose on Schitt&#x27;s Creek and Kate McCallister in the Home Alone films, will play an undisclosed character in HBO&#x27;s adaptation. However, previous rumours suggested she will have a recurring role as an all-new character known as Gail.
O&#x27;Hara joins Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie, Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel, Kaitlyn Dever&#x27;s Abby, Young Mazino&#x27;s Jesse, and Isabela Merced&#x27;s Dina for the second season of The Last of Us.

                              <span>As acclaimed first-person automation sim Satisfactory inches closer to the fifth anniversary of its early access launch, developer Coffee Stain Studios has revealed it&#x27;s eyeing up a version 1.0 release &quot;this year&quot;, and that the game has now sold over 5.5m copies.


Satisfactory released into early access back in March 2019 - initially as an Epic Games Store exclusive before making the jump to Steam the following year - and it quickly made a splash thanks its co-operative, open-world spin on the automated resource exploitation loop popularised by deeloper Wube Software&#x27;s much-loved Factorio.


In Satisfatory, Factorio&#x27;s irresistably compulsive fundamental formula - in which, essentially, you mine stuff to craft stuff that&#x27;ll make mining more stuff easier so you can craft bigger stuff and so on - plays in first-person across a vibrant, explorable sci-fi open-world, with up to four friends able to work together to achieve their goals. It&#x27;s a twist that&#x27;s clearly resonated with people too, as developer Coffee Stain has now revealed Satisfactory has sold over 5.5m copies since early access began.

Carrey starred as the infamous villain (Eggman, if you must) in the first two films and is now confirmed to reprise the role (thanks Variety) despite fan theories about the fate of the character.


A teaser on the Sonic the Hedgehog film account features a laugh from the villain, hinting at his return. &quot;You all thought I was gone, but I&#x27;ve just been underground,&quot; it reads. &quot;What you&#x27;ve seen from me is only a shadow of things to come...&quot;

The report was published by German PC gaming outlet GameStar and YouTube channel Game Two earlier this week, and is based on testimonies from 16 former Fntastic employees, one volunteer, and seven employees at publisher Mytona.
The claims paint a bleak image of the working environment at Fntastic, which include allegations of toxic management, in particular co-founders Eduard and Aysen Gotovtsev, and a lack of direction.

                              <span>Infamous Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser believes the company used him as an example, and says his prison sentence and fine are designed to send a message to others who cross the company in the future.
To quickly recap, Bowser was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices back in 2022. The Canadian programmer had worked as part of a larger hacking group known as Team Xecuter, which in turn made millions from the sale of devices which enabled pirated video games to be played on a number of Nintendo&#x27;s consoles. At the time of his sentence, Bowser pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, as well as an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo&#x27;s own civil lawsuit against him.
Bowser was subsequently released from prison last year, however he will remain in debt to Nintendo for decades to come. In April, Bowser said Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.

                              <span>The boss of indie publisher Devolver Digital has stepped down with immediate effect, following yesterday&#x27;s confirmation of layoffs at the company&#x27;s Artificer studio. 


Outgoing CEO Douglas Morin departed &quot;as part of planning for Devolver&#x27;s long-term growth and development&quot;, the company said in a statement. He has been replaced by Harry Miller, a Devolver co-founder who served as CEO previously.


Devolver announced yesterday that 28 people are set to lose their jobs at the Polish-based Artificer this year, the majority of which will depart this month.

That&#x27;s now been confirmed by both the Hasbro-owned Wizards of the Coast and Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke, of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 fame.


According to a report by Pandaily, Hasbro was seeking to sell the IP with Tencent as a potential buyer and Larian Studios acting as an intermediary - 30 percent of the developer is owned by Tencent.

The numbers back up the positive reception Infinite Wealth has had from players. The game also had the series&#x27; biggest Steam launch ever, racking up over 45,000 concurrent players at peak.

PlayStation Game Size has revealed the download size of the game from the back-end of the PlayStation Store, as well as the existence of a Rebirth demo in which players will earn the in-game item Kupo Charm - Survival Set.



PlayStation will be hosting another State of Play next week dedicated solely to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth with an &quot;extensive look&quot; at the game and &quot;exciting news you won&#x27;t want to miss&quot;. Could this include an immediate demo, or at least a release date for one?

                              <span>Last week, developer Tango Gameworks distributed a relatively minor Hi-Fi Rush update to celebrate the first anniversary of the acclaimed rhythm-brawler&#x27;s release; however, dataminers poking around the update&#x27;s innards are now claiming to have found further evidence - in the form of unique t-shirt designs - that a PlayStation and Switch launch is on the way.


Reports that the previously PC and Xbox exclusive Hi-Fi Rush could be making its way to PlayStation and Switch first began circulating in January, after a number of reliable leakers started expanding on claims by insider Nate the Hate that Microsoft was set to &quot;one of [its] more acclaimed first party releases to a competitor system&quot; this year.


And while there&#x27;s been no sign of an official announcement to back up those reports in the weeks since, datamined discoveries in Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s latest update (thanks Wario64) have lent further credence to the rumours. Patch 7, as last week&#x27;s update is officially known, includes an Anniversary T-Shirt Bundle containing new clothing for Chai to wear. Four of these designs are available to everyone, while three are exclusive to the platform - Xbox, Steam, or the Epic Games Store - players own the game on. However, a number of dataminers are now claiming to have unearthed two additional, unused T-shirts in the update, looking suspiciously like exclusive designs for Switch and PlayStation.

The Forever Labyrinth, which has been made in partnership with the Google Arts &amp; Culture initiative, transports players to an ever-shifting maze of rooms - resembling everything from serene gardens to clifftops, forests, and cellars - as they search for their friend Professor Sheldrake, who&#x27;s lost amid its mysterious interlinking passageways.


These passageways take the form of paintings and art - &quot;drawn from the collections of great museums who are keen to share their treasures in new and exciting ways online&quot;, as the press release puts it - scattered around each room. By collecting clues and identifying elements present within the artwork, players can learn to navigate the labyrinth and hopefully find their friend - if the monster ceaselessly devouring the world doesn&#x27;t get them first.

                              <span>Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Abubakar Salim - who voiced Bayek in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins and starred in HBO&#x27;s Raised by Wolves - now has a demo on Steam ahead of its PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch release this April.


Tales of Kenzera, a Metroidvania-style side-scrolling action-adventure, was unveiled by Salim during an emotional appearance at last year&#x27;s The Game Awards in which he paid tribute to his late father. &quot;For a long time,&quot; he explained, &quot;I&#x27;ve struggled to find a way of communicating my journey with grief. To now be able to do that through Zau&#x27;s story of loss, growth and healing in Tales of Kenzera: Zau feels so right.&quot;


Taking inspiration from African Bantu tales, the game - which is being developed by Salim&#x27;s Surgent Studios and published by EA via its Originals label - follows the journey of Zau, a young shaman who bargains with the God of death to bring his Baba back from darkness.

                              <span>Following a cautious, gradual roll-out to stop everything blowing up in a tangle of lost progress and Tenno tears, developer Digital Extremes has announced that free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe&#x27;s long-awaited cross-platform save feature is now available to all players.


Digital Extremes has been slowly working away on Warframe&#x27;s cross-platform support for a number of years now; cross-play was first introduced back in December 2022, while cross-save - enabling players to pick up where they left off regardless of the platform they&#x27;re playing on - starting rolling out in December last year.


At the time, Digital Extremes explained it would be taking a cautious approach and introducing cross-save in phases, to avoid risking timeouts caused by high demand - something that could potentially be catastrophic for a feature as sensitive as account merging. Since then, it&#x27;s been rolling out cross-save support to players in batches, but today brings the news it&#x27;ll now be immediately available to anyone that wants to take advantage of the feature.

                              <span>Imane &quot;Pokimane&quot; Anys announced earlier this week she was leaving Twitch and has taken to her podcast to explain why.


In short, her exclusivity deal with the Amazon-owned streaming platform came to an end and Pokimane decided not to renew the contract. &quot;The end of an era,&quot; she posted on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;Twitch has been my home for a decade...but it&#x27;s time to say thank you for all the memories and love during my League, Fortnite, and Among Us days.&quot;


It means Twitch - a platform derided for its lack of diversity - has just lost one of its most popular and high profile female streamers and, on her podcast series Don&#x27;t Tell Anyone, she detailed her concerns about the platform.

                              <span>There&#x27;s now a short demo available for the upcoming Switch remake of puzzle platformer Mario vs. Donkey Kong on the Nintendo eShop, ahead of its release later this month.
The demo lets you play through four levels from the first world - three in which Mario collects the toys, and one where you get to lead the Mini-Marios to a toy box.
Nintendo has also released a new overview trailer for the game to coincide with the demo.

                              <span>If you have been wanting to play Alan Wake 2, but were put off by the game&#x27;s semi-regular, flashing jump scares, I have good news. 


As part of its recent update, Remedy has added a feature that will allow you to tone down those horror flashes (apparently a much-requested addition). Players can now opt for either a Low or Normal visual and audio intensity of horror flash, to curate the game better to their liking. 


Along with this option to dial back on the scaries, the studio has also introduced a Chapter Select function. This will allow players to load up any mission they fancy as long as they have previously unlocked it. Yes, this means you can go back and replay Alan Wake 2&#x27;s awesome musical moments again and again and again.

&quot;Yesterday, Devolver and studio Artificer made the tough decision to reduce the Artificer workforce by 28 employees, 18 effective immediately and 10 after their current project releases,&quot; it told us. 
&quot;Over the past year, both companies have worked together to navigate the studio&#x27;s difficulties to ensure Artificer remains open and that their hard work is realised with the launch of their next game. Layoffs are not easy, and the remaining team at Artificer and Devolver Digital are committed to supporting these talented and creative professionals find new roles throughout the industry.&quot;

Given the mysterious nature of the Blue Hole, where Dave the Diver is set, it&#x27;s not surprising that it&#x27;s prone to visits from the famous sea monster.
Developer Mintrocket hasn&#x27;t said much on how Godzilla will fit into the game, other than telling players to &quot;prepare to meet the King of the Monsters in the Blue Hole&quot;. Godzilla makes his appearance at the end of the announcement trailer for Dave the Diver&#x27;s PlayStation release.

                              <span>At last night&#x27;s State of Play, Vertigo Games and Deep Silver lifted the lid on Metro Awakening, an upcoming origin story for the Metro series.


The game is described as a story-driven adventure, built exclusively for VR. It promises plenty of stealth and a good dash of combat, with the developer stating this will be the &quot;most immersive&quot; Metro experience to date. 


You will play as Serdar in Metro Awakening. Serdar is &quot;a doctor and a rationalist&quot; in search of medication for his wife. This search will take players to the tunnels beneath Moscow, but it won&#x27;t be an easy trip. You see, the tunnels are full of mutants.  &quot;As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become...&quot; the official blurb teases. You can see Metro Awakening&#x27;s announcement trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good long while since we&#x27;ve seen anything concrete from Konami and developer Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 remake, but the project has now received a fresh airing as part of Sony&#x27;s latest PlayStation State of Play showcase, this time with a trailer focusing on the game&#x27;s &quot;improved and modernised&quot; combat.


Combat perhaps isn&#x27;t the first thing you&#x27;d expect Konami&#x27;s marketing material to dwell on given it&#x27;s quite some way down the list of elements that made the original Silent Hill 2 such a beloved horror experience, but the trailer does, in fairness, hang back a whole 40 seconds before switching out the atmospheric meandering for bat-swinging, shotgun-blasting action.


Additionally, it&#x27;s reassuring, and perhaps even a little surprising, to see just how closely Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 remake hews to aesthetic of the original 2001 PlayStation 2 game - it certainly doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;re in for a radical tonal reinvention here.

It&#x27;s set to take place on 6th February with an &quot;extensive look&quot; at the game and &quot;exciting news you won&#x27;t want to miss&quot;.


What are you hoping to see? Could Square Enix drop a demo like they did with Final Fantasy 16?

                              <span>During this evening&#x27;s State of Play, we were all treated to a brand new and rather surreal look at Death Stranding 2, officially now known as On the Beach (as suspected). 


The sequel was first announced to be in development back in 2022 during the Game Awards, with a  bamboozling trailer featuring Léa Seydoux and Norman Reedus.


Tonight&#x27;s trailer has now given us another slice of Kojima-infused pie, and once again it is as perplexing as you would expect. It includes a rather epic looking battle that I won&#x27;t spoil by trying to describe it here. We also got a brief look at Elle Fanning&#x27;s Death Stranding 2 character. The actress was first confirmed to be part of the sequel a while ago, after a series of enigmatic teases from Kojima (although, we all guessed).

This new &quot;next-generation action espionage game&quot; will be a fresh, original IP - as Metal Gear Solid remains owned by Konami - and will also be a movie as well.


&quot;Preparations are udnerway, but production will begin in earnest at Kojima Productions after Death Stranding 2,&quot; Kojima said tonight during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play - during which we also learned Death Stranding 2 is set to arrive in 2025.

                              <span>Supermassive Games&#x27; hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is - as was widely reported prior today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play showcase - getting a PlayStation 5 and PC remaster, and it&#x27;ll be launching later this year.


The original Until Dawn released for PlayStation 4 back in 2015, offering up an atmospheric, knowingly cheesy spin on the teen slasher genre whose branching narrative could be nudged in different directions depending on the choices players made - with their actions determining who lived and who died, even what sort of threat they might be facing. 


Supermassive later returned to the well with its similarly styled Dark Pictures Anthology series, but Until Dawn is still regarded as highpoint for the studio, so it&#x27;s nice to see it get a bit of a refresh - or &quot;rebuilt and enhanced&quot; as Sony is putting it - for a new generation of players.

                              <span>Tonight brought a fresh look at Judas, the first new game from BioShock creator Ken Levine in over a decade, and the first ever to come from his studio Ghost Story Games.


A new trailer shown during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play suggested Judas was set in a futuristic world where everyone&#x27;s thoughts are recorded - and shown off on a series of screens. 


All these thoughts are &quot;planted in your brain like weeds in a garden&quot;, a character who looks slightly similar to BioShock Infinite&#x27;s Elizabeth suggests, revealing that she&#x27;s going to help free people from this.

The Short Message - which first surfaced in September 2022 via a South Korea ratings board listing - made its formal debut during tonight&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play showcase, with its announcement trailer revealing a first-person experience focusing on a young woman and featuring heavy interactions with her mobile phone.


&quot;Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new, short-form Silent Hill title, featuring a young, contemporary protagonist,&quot; Konami explains over on the PlayStation Blog. &quot;In 2022, we announced a revival for the Silent Hill series, along with several new titles in development, and this marks the first of that new wave of games to be released.&quot;

Generations featured 2D and 3D levels in a nod to both modern and classic Sonic. Now we&#x27;ll get Shadow levels on top with this new release in autumn this year.

                              <span>With February almost upon us, Sony has revealed the next batch of monthly games it&#x27;s making available to subscribers of its PlayStation Plus Essential tier - and it&#x27;s also announced a two-hour trial of developer Insomniac&#x27;s acclaimed Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 for Premium subscribers.


Starting with the games, February&#x27;s first Essential offering is Foamstars, Square Enix&#x27;s stylish, Splatoon-esque 4v4 live-service game in which players furiously hose each other into submission with a torrent of slippery soapsuds. It&#x27;ll be available on both PlayStation 4 and PS5.


Next up is Rollerdrome, from OlliOlli developer Roll7. Set a world ruled by corporations, where the public is kept placated by a brutal blood sport known as Rollerdrome, it sees players donning rollerskates for some high-speed third-person shooting action, where performing tricks restores ammo and bullet-time-style slo-mo can be deployed against opponents.

                              <span>Palworld - you know, the open-world survival game with the definitely-not-Pokémon you might have heard about once or twice lately - has, less than two weeks after its early access release, officially surpassed 19m players on Xbox Series X/S and PC, with Microsoft now touting it as the biggest third-party launch in Game Pass&#x27; history.


We&#x27;ve known known developer Pocketpair has had a hit on its hands with Palworld for some time now, of course; its early access launch on 19th January got off a bumpy start as an initial influx of players brought the game&#x27;s servers to their knees, and just 24 hours later Pocketpair revealed 2m players were already galavanting around the Palapagos Islands.


Shortly after, Palworld became one of only six games ever to hit 1m concurrent players on Steam, and then updated sales figures brought the news it had shifted over 5m copies in just three days. Six days after launch, Steam sales hit 8m, and now, 12 days in, Pocketpair has announced Palworld has surpassed 19m players.

                              <span>After months of conceptual chatter over on its blog, developer The Chinese Room has finally whipped back the shroud on its version of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, giving a first proper look at its in-game action courtesy of an 15-minute gameplay reveal.


Prior to today, The Chinese Room - which took over the troubled Bloodlines 2 back in 2021, although the studio&#x27;s involvement wasn&#x27;t announced until last year - has talked a little about the game&#x27;s main character, vampire elder Phyre, its clans, and its &quot;visceral immersive combat&quot;, and all of that comes together in today&#x27;s extended gameplay debut.


According to The Chinese Room, this 15-minute first-look features a sequence from relatively early in the game, taking place after Phyre - who in this particular playthrough is part of the Brujah clan, imbuing her with supernatural speed and strength, as well as a rather short fuse - has established herself in Seattle and made inroads with the court. As she investigates the mysterious mark on her hand limiting her powers, she receives a tip-off leading her to a warehouse and a vampire known as Willem who might just have some answers.

Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of 186,892 companies sent data about them to the social network. On average, each participant in the study had their data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied significantly, with some panelists’ data listing over 7,000 companies providing their data. The Markup helped Consumer Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to Consumer Reports...</span>

                              <span>Two weeks after Microsoft&#x27;s turn, it&#x27;s now Sony&#x27;s time in the spotlight. Tonight&#x27;s big PlayStation State of Play broadcast is the first we&#x27;ve heard from Sony this year - and this evening looks set to lay out a line-up of blockbusters coming to PS5 over 2024 - and into 2025.
Join us as we watch and cover everything live from 10pm UK time (GMT) - the show is set to last 40 minutes, and feature 15 games. 
What do we expect? Quite a lot, actually. Sony itself has said to expect &quot;guest appearances from some of the most talented minds in gaming&quot; - and without an invitation ourselves we can only assume this means Hideo Kojima. It&#x27;s high time we heard more about Death Stranding 2. But who else might also qualify? Our money&#x27;s on BioShock creator Ken Levine, whose long-awaited Judas is now finally nearing release.

According to Xbox, Dream Vapor features a pink and purple coloured swirl pattern which will be unique to each controller. Feature-wise this is your bog standard Xbox wireless controller, with the addition of rubberised side grips.
However, you will also unlock an exclusive dynamic background of the same theme so you can match your console&#x27;s Home screen to your hardware.

The studio previously worked on Burnout Paradise Remastered, as well as Need for Speed: Remastered and Need for Speed Unbound.


According to its website, the studio is currently hiring for a AAA arcade racing title built in Unreal 5 for Gen 5 consoles and PC, which is set to disrupt the racing scene.

This makes it the fastest selling Resident Evil title &quot;by far&quot; - a stat tracked by Alex Aniel, writer of Itchy Tasty: An Unofficial History of Resident Evil - although the game still sits behind the likes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Village in terms of total sales to date.


In its recent consolidated financial results, Capcom said these more recent Resident Evil 4 sales have been supported by &quot;ongoing promotional measures&quot; such as free updates for the PlayStation VR2 version.

                              <span>The boss of Apex Legends and Battlefield maker EA has been asked about Nintendo Switch 2, ahead of the unannounced console&#x27;s widely-expected launch later this year.


Quizzed on how Switch 2&#x27;s arrival will impact EA, the company&#x27;s CEO Andrew Wilson said he could &quot;absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced or acknowledge it in any way&quot;, before going on to say the company was pumped for &quot;new platforms&quot; in general.


&quot;What I would say,&quot; Wilson told investors, &quot;to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years have come out and offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution... where we&#x27;re able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly around our biggest franchises like FC, like Madden, like Battlefield, like Apex that has typically been very good for our business.

                              <span>Sega of America will layoff 61 staff next month.


The news has spread following the issue of a Californian WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) notice - required by law to give employees 60 days in advance of sizable layoffs.


Eurogamer can confirm, via the Employment Development Department of the State of California, that two separate layoffs of 12 and 49 staff will take place on 8th March.

                              <span>A group of former Volition developers have joined the development of steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution under the banner of a fresh studio.
Shapeshifter Games has been founded by Volition veterans, following the studio&#x27;s closure last year and poor reception to its Saints Row reboot. Now, LinkedIn profiles of employees have since confirmed Shapeshifter&#x27;s first project (thanks TechRaptor). 
On LinkedIn, Shapeshifter Games stated it is a co-development studio and revealed it was already working &quot;with a top publisher on their next great IP&quot;. Shortly after, inXile Entertainment released a statement announcing its partnership with Shapeshifter to help work on Clockwork Revolution.

One of the main draws of spending £100 on the game&#x27;s deluxe edition was its ability to play from Monday this week, before the game&#x27;s general release on Friday. 


But developer Rocksteady has twice had to take Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#x27;s servers offline to fix problems with the game - leaving the always-online co-op title completely unplayable in the interim.

                              <span>A mobile version of Palworld has appeared on the Apple App Store, said to be coming soon - but it is not the real deal. 


The app, which you can see below in screenshots taken by Eurogamer, appears at first glance to be affiliated with Palworld developer Pocketpair and uses the same promotional images as on PC and Xbox. But this app has nothing to do with Pocketpair, and has instead been published by someone known as Oleksandra Kryccun.


Pocketpair has now said it is aware of this app&#x27;s existence, and warned players not to be fooled by its arrival on the App Store (we&#x27;ve checked, and can&#x27;t see it on the Google Play store at present).

                              <span>Square Enix has finally updated the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series on Steam to offer feature parity with the console versions.


In a new update, assistance features have been added across all six games that allow players to modify the amount of EXP, gil or magic AP they receive, or turn off enemy encounters entirely.


Further, players can switch between the original or newly arranged soundtracks, plus the font type can be switched between modern and classic versions.

                              <span>Microsoft has shared its Q2 2024 financial results, reporting significant revenue gains across its gaming division - including a massive 61 percent increase in Xbox content and services revenue - following its $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


As per its Q2 earnings release, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming revenue increased by 49 percent compared to the equivalent quarter in its previous financial year, with the company recording a 61 percent boost in Xbox content and services revenue - which encompasses money generated by the likes of  Game Pass - alongside a three percent increase in Xbox hardware revenue.


Unsurprisingly, Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard acquisition was a key driver of its Q2 growth, with the deal contributing to just over $2bn in revenue. However, operating expenses and other costs - including transaction- and integration-related costs - saw the net impact of the Activision Blizzard deal result in an operating loss of $440m.

                              <span>Following a little under two weeks of Steam beta testing, Starfield&#x27;s latest patch is now available for all players on PC and Xbox Series X/S, bringing quest fixes, visual improvements, and more.


As noted in Bethesda&#x27;s announcement post, Starfield&#x27;s latest update - officially numbered 1.9.51.0 - has received one additional PC crash fix in the jump from beta to full release. That tweak joins &quot;over a hundred fixes and adjustments&quot; detailed in its previous beta patch notes.


For the most part, updated 1.9.51.0 is focused on quality-of-life improvements and quest fixes, with Bethesda saying its quashed instances of bulldozed objects reappearing when returning to an outpost, ship hatches being marked as inaccessible, and more. There&#x27;s also yet another fix intended to stamp out the lingering issue of asteroids doggedly following ships across the galaxy like overly enthusiastic puppies.

                              <span>If your interests exist squarely within the Venn diagram of Mass Effect and Destiny 2, your day is almost here: Bungie has announced it&#x27;s teaming up with EA and BioWare to bring Commander Shepard and company - or at least something vaguely inspired by them - to its free-to-play shooter as part of a new collaboration event.


As per Bungie&#x27;s announcement, the &#x27;Destiny 2 x BioWare&#x27; team-up will enable Destiny 2 players to &quot;join the crew of the Normandy&quot; from 13th February - which all sounds very exciting until it finishes its sentence, &quot;with new cosmetics and in-game items&quot;.


On the premium cosmetics front, a new Normandy Crew Bundle will be available in the Eververse store once the event begins, containing a Commander Shepard-inspired N7 armour set for Titans, a Garrus-inspired Vakarian set for Hunters, and a Liara-inspired Shadow Broker set for Warlocks. An Omni Strike finisher and Flux Dance will also be purchasable with Silver.

                              <span>Hinterland, the developer behind snowy survival game The Long Dark, has teased an &#x27;unannounced survival game&#x27; currently in development at the studio, and the accompanying alpha footage certainly has the hallmarks of a potential The Long Dark 2.


Hinterland boss Raphael van Lierop (who confirmed he was stepping away from The Long Dark to start a new project at the studio back in 2022) shared the 22 seconds of &quot;in-engine pre-alpha&quot; footage on social media today, along with the caption, &quot;Some good things happening in the Unannounced Survival Games space...&quot;.


The video itself is little more than a slow pan across a slightly ramshackle room - but a closer look might just offer some big clues as to the nature of Hinterland&#x27;s new project. A running tally of &quot;days&quot; scrawled on the mirror and the general makeshift dilapidation of the room certainly suggest some kind of disaster has befallen the world outside, while the two roaring fires and the howling wind absolutely bring The Long Dark&#x27;s big freeze to mind.

As a reminder, Suicide Squad is technically out on 2nd February, but early access was included in its Deluxe Edition, which costs £100 / $100.
At 11:22am this morning, developer Rocksteady announced a scheduled maintenance for Suicide Squad beginning at 11:30am. &quot;The game will be offline until maintenance has been completed,&quot; the developer stated, with no estimate of when it&#x27;ll be back online.

                              <span>Nightingale, the upcoming gaslamp fantasy game from Inflexion Games, will get a server stress test this Friday, 2nd February. It&#x27;s a one-day only affair - if that - running from 6pm to 9pm UK time (1pm to 4pm Eastern). 


Randomly selected players who had previously signed up for the test will start receiving access to the game one hour before. Others will then be invited to play in batches. Again, this will be random, so keep an eye out for an email from Steam.


&quot;Our goal is for all players who signed up for the test to be able to participate. How quickly that happens will be dependent on how the test progresses,&quot; Inflexion said, explaining it will granting access in waves to assess how servers handle large amounts of players logging in at the same time and the developer&#x27;s ability to rapidly scale up in response.

&quot;Over the last decade we have shined a bright sparkling spotlight on many hundreds of games, hosted tens of thousands of people at our in-person events, and reached millions of viewers through our virtual showcases,&quot; the organisation wrote. &quot;And we have done all of this for FREE - providing our programs for no cost to either developers, or players.&quot;

                              <span>Following the departure of Mike Ybarra, Blizzard has announced its new president: Activision&#x27;s former general manager of its Call of Duty franchise, Johanna Faries.


Faries&#x27; new position was announced last night, following layoffs at Microsoft last week. Her appointment marks the first new leader of the studio since Microsoft finally purchased Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in October, following almost two years of regulatory approvals and legal wrangling. Her official first day will be next month, on 5th February.


In an email sent to Blizzard staff, Faries acknowledged that her new role at Blizzard may stir up a &quot;range of reactions, questions and even concerns&quot;. The new president noted Activision, Blizzard and indeed King are all &quot;decidedly different companies with distinct games, cultures and communities&quot;, despite being under one umbrella.

                              <span>Warner Bros will push further into video games as it seeks ways to ensure its big budget franchises generate &quot;more than just one great hit every three or four years&quot;.


&quot;We want it to be &#x27;always on&#x27;,&quot; Warner Bros gaming and streaming boss JB Perrette told Variety. &quot;And the good news is the gaming space is lending itself to that.&quot;


Warner Bros values four of its franchises as worth a billion dollars each - DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat. Speaking in the same interview, Warner Bros Interactive boss David Haddad said that video games will be a key component in ensuring those franchises remain evergreen - and ever lucrative.
