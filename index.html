                    <span>Today sees the launch of God of War on PC - arguably the biggest PlayStation franchise to make the leap from console so far - and in a new interview published to coincide with its release, Sony Santa Monica creative director Cory Barlog has revealed it was Sony&#x27;s own internal studios that pushed to get PlayStation games on PC.
Asked if Sony&#x27;s decision to begin porting its games to the platform was something championed by the Santa Monica team early on, Barlog, in conversation with GameInformer, suggested it was actually the developers across Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Studios network that were ultimately instrumental in convincing the company to make the move to PC.

                    <span>With Dying Light 2&#x27;s long-awaited release looming, developer Techland has spoken up about its post-launch content plans, giving players its &quot;guarantee&quot; it&#x27;ll continue supporting the game for at least five years after its arrival.
Many would argue it was the original Dying Light&#x27;s extensive programme of post-launch content that proved the greatest contributor to its enormous success - Techland is still supporting the game with a mixture of paid and free content some seven years after its initial release - and the studio looks set to follow the same long-tail formula for its imminent sequel.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment is currently working on a single-player first-person shooter with a focus on mobility and style, according to a new report - but before irreversible excitement takes hold, it&#x27;s claimed the project won&#x27;t be a Titanfall sequel.
The report follows Respawn creative director Mohammad Alavi&#x27;s recent announcement he&#x27;s departing the studio after 11 year to pursue his &quot;next adventure&quot;. Alavi leading development of a &quot;brand new single-player adventure&quot; at the company, first mentioned in a job listing posted last year, and news of his departure prompted some to ponder the fate of the project.

                    <span>So far, Sega&#x27;s had something of a rollercoaster relationship with NFTs, bursting forth fully enthused last summer before seemingly reining that excitement in more recently. However, its corporate machinations continue behind the scenes and new trademark registrations and logos have emerged revealing Sega&#x27;s new gambit to potentially be called Sega NFT.
Sega first shared its interest in joining the NFT and blockchain throng last April, when it revealed it had partnered with Japanese company Double Jump Tokyo to begin selling the likes of visual art, in-game images, and background music based on its new and classic IPs in NFT form. It then repeated its enthusiastic stance as part of an investor briefing in November.

                    <span>Following a delay at the end of 2021, Valve has confirmed its highly anticipated portable gaming PC Steam Deck is still on track to meet its revised February 2022 launch date.
When Steam Deck reservations first opened in July last year, Valve anticipated its hardware to begin shipping before the end of the year. Unfortunately, disruptions in production caused by a lack of available parts crushed those pre-Christmas dreams and Valve adjusted its planning, telling customers it expected first Steam Deck units to release in February this year.

The researchers from the FAS Center for Systems Biology discovered a network of genes important in squid eye development that are known to also play a crucial role in limb development across animals, including vertebrates and insects. The scientists say these genes have been repurposed in squid to make camera-lens-type eyes.

                    <span>I don’t even know what I think about this. Researchers have developed a malware detection system that uses EM waves: “Obfuscation Revealed: Leveraging Electromagnetic Signals for Obfuscated Malware Classification.”
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is constituted of devices that are exponentially growing in number and in complexity. They use numerous customized firmware and hardware, without taking into consideration security issues, which make them a target for cybercriminals, especially malware authors.
We will present a novel approach of using side channel information to identify the kinds of threats that are targeting the device. Using our approach, a malware analyst is able to obtain precise knowledge about malware type and identity, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques which may prevent static or symbolic binary analysis. We recorded 100,000 measurement traces from an IoT device infected by various in-the-wild malware samples and realistic benign activity. Our method does not require any modification on the target device. Thus, it can be deployed independently from the resources available without any overhead. Moreover, our approach has the advantage that it can hardly be detected and evaded by the malware authors. In our experiments, we were able to predict three generic malware types (and one benign class) with an accuracy of 99.82%. Even more, our results show that we are able to classify altered malware samples with unseen obfuscation techniques during the training phase, and to determine what kind of obfuscations were applied to the binary, which makes our approach particularly useful for malware analysts...</span>

Specifically, Krafton (thanks TechCrunch) is targeting the continued availability of Garena&#x27;s Free Fire games - which it calls &quot;thinly veiled unauthorised versions of Battlegrounds&quot; - with the original Free Fire having already been the recipient of a legal challenge by the PUBG developer.

These additions - as well as some nice tweaks to the game&#x27;s visuals, such as improved reflections and shadows via ray-tracing, Intel XeSS support and variable rate shading, are all free and on the way over the coming months.

                    <span>Popular manga My Hero Academia is being turned into a free-to-play battle royale game, because there aren&#x27;t enough of those already.

Now a single game, well more of a museum, collates all those minigames into one big game.

                    <span>With only a couple of months to go until the launch of Gran Turismo 7 - be still my heart that beats like a piston - Polyphony Digital is revealing some more of what to expect, including a return of an iconic circuit last seen in 2013&#x27;s Gran Turismo 6. Which is to say that Daytona International Speedway is back.
You might know the circuit from its slightly fanciful appearance in Sega&#x27;s Daytona USA, and while that game remains an all-time great I regret to inform you that the real thing isn&#x27;t overlooked by a cliff with Sonic etched into its face, nor is there a playable slot machine on the bridge over the back straight. But!

                    <span>Remember when the US and Australian police surreptitiously owned and operated the encrypted cell phone app ANOM? They arrested 800 people in 2021 based on that operation.
New documents received by Motherboard show that over 100 of those phones were shipped to users in the US, far more than previously believed.
What’s most interesting to me about this new information is how the US used the Australians to get around domestic spying laws:

                    <span>PUBG: Battlegrounds is now free-to-play, and the gambit appears to be going well so far, with the popular battle royale shooter having peaked at 669k concurrent players on Steam earlier today, meaning it came close to doubling December&#x27;s figures.
As noted by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter, PUBG saw its concurrent peak player count climb to 668,707 on Steam following its shift to free-to-play earlier today, beating its previous two month highs by more than 300k players.

That&#x27;s according to a new report by VentureBeat&#x27;s Jeff Grub, who shares a recent email circulated to store staff by senior management at UK retailer Game as an example of the move. &quot;Stores have until the close of day Wednesday 19, January to remove all POS and ESD cards from all customer-facing areas and update their digital bays in line with this week&#x27;s upcoming commercial update&quot;, the message reads.

                    <span>Following reports earlier this week that Lucid Games, the UK developer behind Destruction All-Stars, was no longer working on a new Twisted Metal game for Sony as previously claimed, a new report has suggested it&#x27;s now being handled by first-party PlayStation studio Firesprite Games, which only recently saw the director of MotorStorm join its ranks.
Word of a new entry in the Twisted Metal series first emerged last September, when GamesBeat journalist Jeff Grubb claimed the project was in early development. Shortly after, reports suggested Destruction All-Stars developer Lucid Games had landed the gig and that this latest instalment would be turning the car combat series into a free-to-play game.

                    <span>A listing for an Xbox version of Shadow Man: Remastered, Nightdive Studios&#x27; enhanced version of Acclaim&#x27;s much-loved 1999 action-adventure, has appeared on the Microsoft Store, suggesting it&#x27;ll arrive alongside the previously announced PlayStation version later this week.
Shadow Man - which was based on Valiant Comics&#x27; Shadowman series and originally released for N64, PSone, Dreamcast, and PC back in 1999 - charts the adventures of Michael LeRoi, the latest in a line of voodoo warriors all adopting the Shadow Man moniker. The fondly remembered video game adaptation reimagines the comic book character&#x27;s battle against the forces of darkness as a blend of third-person platforming, puzzling, and combat, playing out across both the real world and its terrifying counterpart, Deadside.

                    <span>2021 might not have been a banner year for video games (although it was certainly no slouch), but video games there were, and many were sold. To celebrate that fact, Sony has now offered up its own list of last year&#x27;s most popular games, as per the greatest number of downloads on its PlayStation Store - and of no huge surprise, FIFA 22 is at number one here in Europe.
Sony&#x27;s official list is actually four lists spanning four different categories - the top paid PlayStation 5, PS4, and PSVR games, plus the biggest free-to-play games - and those are separated out again across two different territories: Europe and the US/Canada.

                    <span>Researchers have figured how how to intercept and fake an iPhone reboot:
We’ll dissect the iOS system and show how it’s possible to alter a shutdown event, tricking a user that got infected into thinking that the phone has been powered off, but in fact, it’s still running. The “NoReboot” approach simulates a real shutdown.

                    <span>As 2021 drew to a close, the long-running Yogcast Jingle Jam charity bundle event returned for its latest instalment, this time taking the form of a truly spectacular 56-game bundle - and organisers have now confirmed the endeavour raised a total of £3.3m for good causes.
2021&#x27;s bundle was impressive enough from a content perspective, gathering up the likes Eurogamer&#x27;s Essential-rated Widermyth, linguistics adventure Heaven&#x27;s Vault, Viking strategy Northguard, top-down action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter, plus Surviving Mars, Murder by Numbers, 20XX, and a load more. It was absolutely unmissable from a value perspective, however, amounting to around £650 worth of games for anyone that donated £35 or more.

Jones&#x27; affinity with Full Throttle - developer LucasArt&#x27;s 1995 point-and-click biker gang classic, written by the legendary Tim Schafer - is, of course, pretty well-known by this point. &quot;It blew my mind! I LOVED that game,&quot; he wrote in a tweet at the start of last year, &quot;I mean, REALLY loved that game.&quot; And he wasn&#x27;t joking, either.

                    <span>Lego has announced it is indefinitely suspending the release of its Overwatch 2 Titan set, initially scheduled to launch on 1st February, in light of ongoing concerns related to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s workplace culture - which was described as a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; in a California State lawsuit launched last July.
The controversy surrounding Activision Blizzard has only deepened since then; November saw the release of a damning Wall Street Journal report detailing further alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - with the publication levying particular criticism at CEO Bobby Kotick, claiming he&#x27;d been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across the company &quot;for years&quot;.

Good day, everyone 👋
Welcome to the first episode of the APAC edition of the &quot;Meet Our Contributors&quot; blog post series.
In this post, we&#x27;ll introduce you to five amazing folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers of numerous community initiatives.

                    <span>Over the weekend, developer Techland attempted to stir up some additional excitement for the impending arrival of its parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel Dying Light 2 by claiming players would likely need to set aside &quot;at least 500 hours&quot; to fully complete the game. The statement perhaps didn&#x27;t have quite the desired effect, however, drawing ire from skeptical fans, and the company has now offered further clarification, saying the game should only take around 20 hours to beat at its most fundamental level.
Techland initially made its 500-hour completion claim in a post to Twitter on Saturday, and following a less-than-stellar response to the news - some fans called the extended playtime off-putting - Techland attempted to allay concerns by clarifying the figure only applied when completing all the quests, endings, and exploring every part of the world. Regular players, it said, should &quot;finish the story + side quests... in less than 100 hours&quot;.

Well, today is not the day to find out as the publisher has announced Cities: Skylines&#x27; upcoming Airports expansion - which comes to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 25th January - will be accompanied by a four-strong batch of supporting paid DLC.
Up first is a new Content Creator Map Pack, costing £3.99/€4.99/$4.99 USD and introducing eight new terrain maps created by Sanctum Gamer - as featured in the announcement trailer.

                    <span>Following a few vague teases (and some decidedly more specific teases) that Sam &quot;Serious&quot; Stone was prepping to return for another bout of explosive FPS action in the near future, publisher Devolver Digital has finally revealed all. A new standalone expansion for Serious Sam 4, titled Siberian Mayhem, comes to Steam on 25th January.
Siberian Mayhem, as you might already have deduced, sees Sam trading the comparatively sun-drenched climes of Serious Sam 4 for some chillier action as he journeys across the Russian wilderness in search of the traitorous General Brand - an adventure featuring five &quot;massive&quot; new missions across Arctic coastlines, desolate forests, abandoned villages, and a ghost town.

                    <span>Lucid Games, the UK developer behind Destruction All-Stars, is reportedly no longer working on a new Twisted Metal game for Sony as previously claimed, with the project now said to have been handed over to an unnamed first-party studio.
Word of a new Twisted Metal game first surfaced last September, when GamesBeat journalist Jeff Grubb claimed the project was in early development. Shortly after, VGC offered additional details, reporting Lucid Games would be the studio handling the new instalment and that the project would follow Destruction All-Stars lead as a free-to-play game.

                    <span>An Xbox version of real-time strategy Age of Empires 4 looks like it&#x27;s currently in testing within Microsoft.

                    <span>Half-Life: Ray Traced is a new attempt to get hardware accelerated ray-tracing working in Valve&#x27;s first-person shooter classic - and you should be able to play it yourself later this year. 
For now, though, you can gaze below at roughly a minute&#x27;s worth of footage showing the project in action. It&#x27;s being worked upon by sultim_t, who previously put together a Serious Sam 1 ray-tracing mod, and is based on another previous attempt at Half-Life ray-tracing.

                    <span>A YouTuber has created an adapter for the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller allowing it to be played with one hand.
Akaki Kuumeri is responsible for the design, which adds a snap-on adapter allowing the left stick to be manoeuvred by balancing the controller on a thigh or flat surface and moving the entire controller.

                    <span>Heavy Rain and Detroit developer Quantic Dream is reportedly working on a new project based upon The Dark Sorcerer, its 2013 PlayStation 4 tech demo.
The demo featured a grey-haired sorcerer and a goblin sidekick attempting to cast a spell - until things went wrong, and it was revealed the whole thing was based on a video game motion capture stage.

From Software&#x27;s hotly-anticipated action RPG - for which Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin has contributed to the world-building - surpassed Techland&#x27;s Dying Light 2: Stay Human earlier this week to secure the top spot as Steam&#x27;s most-wanted game.

Having seemingly participated in a recent closed network test, YouTuber ER-SA shared the six-minute teaser, which - despite many hidden, broken, and/or missing components - gives a taste of what players can look forward to when Elden Ring releases next month.

                    <span>Rust has sold over 12 million copies.
Making the announcement in a new year round-up, developer Facepunch revealed that as well as selling 12,481,079 copies of the game, it&#x27;s also sold over one million DLC packs - a surprisingly modest number, given the number of people invested in the vanilla game, perhaps? - and has over 400,000 users on its Discord server.

In an interview with Tweak Town, Sega CEO Haruki Satomi acknowledged the publisher would like to &quot;try out various [NFT] experiments&quot;, but was quick to say &quot;nothing is decided at this point&quot; and the company would have to &quot;carefully assess&quot; &quot;what will be accepted and what will not be by the users&quot;.

Kubernetes is removing dockershim in the upcoming v1.24 release. We&#x27;re excited
to reaffirm our community values by supporting open source container runtimes,
enable a smaller kubelet, and increase engineering velocity for teams using
Kubernetes. If you use Docker Engine as a Container Runtime
for your Kubernetes cluster, get ready to migrate to 1.24! To check if you&#x27;re
affected, refer to Check whether dockershim deprecation affects you.

                    <span>Mario Kart 9 is now in &quot;active development&quot; within Nintendo, according to Tokyo-based industry consultant Dr. Serkan Toto. 
The continued sales success of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had left many fans wondering if Nintendo was still planning an all-new Mario Kart for Nintendo Switch - or whether the platform would just be left with its hugely-popular Wii U port.

Gematsu spotted a listing for The Ascent on the website of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). This follows a similar listing spotted last month in Taiwan. I imagine an announcement isn&#x27;t too far off.

                    <span>Very good adventure game Lair of the Clockwork God is getting a fancypants, Limited Run, physical release on Switch and PS4.
I&#x27;m delighted because I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Lair of the Clockwork God. I reviewed it on PC in 2020 and loved it. It&#x27;s an adventure game and sometimes a platform game about two characters, Dan and Ben. And they bicker, endlessly. One represents point-and-clicks, and the other, platformers. And they don&#x27;t always get along.

                    <span>We have discovered a squid — (Oegopsida, Magnapinnidae, Magnapinna sp.) — that lives at 6,000 meters deep.
:They’re really weird,” says Vecchione. “They drift along with their arms spread out and these really long, skinny, spaghetti-like extensions dangling down underneath them.” Microscopic suckers on those filaments enable the squid to capture their prey.
But the squid that Jamieson and Vecchione saw in the footage captured 6,212 meters below the ocean’s surface is a small one. They estimate that its mantle measured 10 centimeters long — ­about a third the size of the largest-known magnapinnid. And the characteristically long extensions observed on other magnapinnids were nowhere to be seen in the video. That could mean, says Vecchione, that this bigfin squid was a juvenile...</span>

                    <span>This development suprises no one who has been paying attention:
Researchers now believe AirTags, which are equipped with Bluetooth technology, could be revealing a more widespread problem of tech-enabled tracking. They emit a digital signal that can be detected by devices running Apple’s mobile operating system. Those devices then report where an AirTag has last been seen. Unlike similar tracking products from competitors such as Tile, Apple added features to prevent abuse, including notifications like the one Ms. Estrada received and automatic beeping.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been enjoying your time sleuthing around the sunny, Mediterranean-inspired climes of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, you might be interested to know that developer Frogwares has just released a brand-new case to crack in the form of its Beyond a Joke DLC.
Beyond a Joke, which is out now on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5, serves up a new quest - the first of &quot;three major bonus story content additions&quot;, as Frogwares puts it - in which young Sherlock Holmes and his chiselled jawline go on the hunt for an &quot;unstoppable&quot; thief targeting the island of Cordona&#x27;s ultra-rich &quot;with brazen gusto and open mockery&quot;.

                    <span>Actor Ernie Hudson, perhaps better known as Ghostbusters&#x27; Winston Zeddemore, has claimed a new video game based on the legendary movie series is &quot;definitely happening&quot;.
This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve heard word of a new Ghostbusters game, of course; back in October, Raphael Saadiq, the co-founder of Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunter Grounds developer Illfonic, let slip that the studio was currently working on the title. Unsurprisingly though, given that the game is still yet to be officially announced, Saadiq hasn&#x27;t offered any update since, leaving movie fans uncertain of the project&#x27;s status.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot going on in the world of Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock today; not only has the studio announced it&#x27;s been acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, it&#x27;s also just released the first big post-launch content update for its well-received co-op zombie shooter. The latter brings with it a range of tweaks and additions, the most notable of which is a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression.
First the acquisition news; as of today, following Tencent&#x27;s purchase of Turtle Rock&#x27;s parent company Slamfire, the studio is now wholly owned by the Chinese conglomerate. According to the announcement, Turtle Rock will continue to operate independently at its Lake Forest, California, offices, with co-founders Phil Robb and Chris Ashton remaining at the helm.

                    <span>This seems big:
The UK government has officially included decapod crustaceans–including crabs, lobsters, and crayfish–and cephalopod mollusks–including octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish–in its Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill. This means they are now recognized as “sentient beings” in the UK.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>Minecraft, you probably don&#x27;t need telling, is popular; it&#x27;s sold over 238M copies since its launch in 2009 making it the best-selling game of all time, it claims over 140M monthly active users, and was enticing enough for Microsoft to spend an eye-watering $2.5 billion USD acquiring its developer Mojang back in 2014. And now here&#x27;s another massive figure for the record books: it&#x27;s officially the first game to surpass one trillion views on YouTube.
To celebrate the immense milestone, YouTube has launched a new website highlighting the creators and videos that helped Minecraft reach 1,000,000,000,000 views over the last decade - a figure that would, as YouTube points out to put it into some kind of perspective, amount to over 30,000 years if each view equated to just one second of time.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting news of the next instalment in the nearly three-decade-old Settlers series, your patience will soon be awarded: publisher Ubisoft has announced it&#x27;ll be revealing more information on the long-delayed game in January next year.
Ubisoft first revealed it would be revisiting the Settlers&#x27; much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula in a new series instalment back in 2018. At the time, it told fans to expect the title in autumn the following year but, as that window grew near, the publisher announced a delay, pushing the game&#x27;s release into 2020.

                    <span>The Queen and the Sea, the third paid expansion for developer Motion Twin&#x27;s majestic rogue-like action-platformer Dead Cells, will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 6th January next year, and there&#x27;s a first trailer to celebrate the news.
The Queen and the Sea, which follows previous paid expansions The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls, brings a touch of the nautical to Dead Cells&#x27; acclaimed action, introducing new enemies, bosses, weapons, and two brand-new biomes - Infested Shipwreck and the Lighthouse - that&#x27;ll run parallel to the existing High Peak Castle and Throne Room late-game stages.

                    <span>Red Candle Games, the developer behind critically acclaimed horror outings Detention and Devotion, has - following a bit of an animated tease earlier this year - formally announced its latest title, an action-platformer loosely inspired by From Software&#x27;s superb Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice that&#x27;s currently going by the name of Nine Sols.
Details are extremely limited right now, but Red Candle describes Nine Sols (a working title at present) as a &quot;lore rich hand-drawn 2D platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat&quot;. The developer has also shared a wonderfully evocative bit of promo art that - while a significant aesthetic departure from its previous games - does suggest, with its mangled limbs and pools of blood, that we&#x27;re not exactly in family friendly territory here.

                    <span>Tis the season of festive sales in video game land, and the Epic Games Store has now thrown open its shutters and bellowed news of its own discount offerings into the cold winter night, which includes the return of its daily &quot;mystery gift&quot; free games, starting with Shenmue 3.
Shenmue 3 is, of course, the long, long, long-awaited third instalment in developer Yu Suzuki&#x27;s classic action-adventure series, which finally arrived in 2019 following a gap of 18 years between it and its predecessor. Picking up where Shenmue 2 left off, part 3 sees protagonist Ryo Hazuki resume his quest for vengeance after the murder of his father in the original, delivering a new chapter that Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robison called both &quot;archaic and arcane&quot; and &quot;a worthy successor to what many consider an all-time great&quot; in his review.
