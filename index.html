                              <span>Those pesky Xenomorphs are heading back PC and consoles next year in the newly announced Aliens: Dark Descent.


Coming from developer Tindalos Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment, Aliens: Dark Descent is described as a &quot;squad-based, single-player action game&quot; that sees players commanded their soldiers in real-time as they take on Xenomorphs - including Facehuggers, Praetorians, and Alien Queens - as well as rogue operatives from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.


&quot;Infiltrate large open levels and annihilate enemies with your squad, dispatching orders strategically and intuitively at the touch of a button,&quot; the game&#x27;s newly launched Steam page explains. &quot;Tread carefully, as your foes will adapt their tactics to your actions while hunting you down because death is permanent. Forge unique paths for survival, uncovering shortcuts, creating safe zones, and setting up motion trackers in a persistent world where your actions impact levels forever.&quot;

                              <span>We knew it was coming, but Moss: Book 2 finally has a release date on Meta Quest 2, with Polyarc&#x27;s adorable VR adventure sequel set to make the jump from PSVR on 21st July.


Moss: Book 2, which picks up immediately after the events of the first game, once again builds its action around a hybrid of first-person and third-person perspectives as players, in the role of an omniscient spirit, help guide mouse protagonist Quill on her quest to free the land from the clutches of the evil Arcane.


Polyarc&#x27;s sequel initially launched for PSVR earlier this year, and Eurogamer&#x27;s resident virtual reality aficionado Ian Higton was delighted to revisit the series&#x27; cinematic blend of puzzling and combat in his glowing Moss: Book 2 review.

                              <span>Ahead of tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, Sony&#x27;s The Last of Us Part 1 remake - one of the worst kept secrets in the industry today - has leaked. So yes, it is real. And not only is it really real, but it will also be releasing as soon as 2nd September for the PlayStation 5 at a retail price of $70. 
To accompany this news, we got our first look at the remake in action thanks to a brand-new trailer. You can check it out for yourself by following this link.
As you can see, the Ellie and Joel that we first met all the way back in 2013 now have a much sleeker look, but it is most certainly still them. There is fighting, there is compassion, and there are enough clickers to give one spores for thought throughout this reveal. Rather nicely, the game&#x27;s DLC - Left Behind - will also be included in this remake.

                              <span>A couple of months back, reddit user Shin was beavering away at an Elden Ring Game Boy remake.


And now it&#x27;s out! Available to play on itch.io, the game offers a miniature green-tinged version of the Lands Between - or at least, the Precipice of Anticipation, Northern Limgrave, and Stormveil Castle - presented in a Zelda-inspired top-down fashion.


The game runs in-browser, but Shin recommends using real Game Boy hardware or an Analogue Pocket for saving, better colours, and higher accuracy.

Dialogue between Kamala Khan and her high school friends revealed they play Super Smash Bros together - meaning Nintendo&#x27;s all-star fighter is now Marvel Cinematic Universe canon.


Kamala herself seemed to be a fan of Smash, though her friend Nakia was less keen.

A temporary fix was initially deployed which restricted the Battle Pass from granting unlocks (while progression would still be tracked).
However, work on a permanent fix led to the return of the same errors, leading DICE to revert all changes.

                              <span>Xbox games are coming to TVs soon, Microsoft has confirmed.


Microsoft announced a deal with Samsung to bring the Xbox App to 2022 Smart TVs at the end of the month, so you can play cloud-enabled Game Pass Ultimate games without a console.

Microsoft said playing Xbox games on 2022 Samsung TVs will be a seamless experience, similar to using any other streaming app on your telly. It also means you can play Fortnite via Xbox Cloud Gaming for free and without a subscription on your telly.

The new feature is expected to launch later this year, Microsoft said.


Microsoft&#x27;s announcement on this is pretty vague - there&#x27;s not much to go on beyond it&#x27;s a feature that&#x27;s coming out later in 2022. We don&#x27;t have a list of the &quot;select&quot; games that will work here, either.

                              <span>Microsoft has revealed Project Moorcroft, a new program that will bring demos of upcoming games to Xbox Game Pass.


Set to roll out within the next year, Project Moorcroft will see Microsoft pay developers to create demos of their upcoming games and bring them to the subscription service. Microsoft did not say whether there&#x27;s a mandated time-limit for these demos, or how long they will stick around the subscription service after launch.


The program kicks off with a focus on demos for indie games and helping their developers get data about and build excitement for their games.

The remaster of both Grand Theft Auto 5 and Online was first announced back in 2020 during the reveal of the PlayStation 5. 


The remaster features an upgraded 4K gameplay at 60FPS, HDR lighting, ray-tracing and faster loading times.

Today, we have been given a closer look at Bella Ramsay as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel on set, and it is actually pretty heartwarming. 
As shown in the tweet below, the two can be seen resting their weary heads on each other as production on the show goes on around them.

Fortunately, we got some new details from members of its Infinity Ward development team, courtesy of VentureBeat. 


First, as described in Eurogamer&#x27;s preview yesterday, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the engine&#x27;s fancy new water tech.

                              <span>When you think of CD Projekt Red and the word Cyberpunk together, you do get a certain thought in your head. Yes, we all get visions of that disastrous launch. However, this could all be about to change, as a new trailer and some bonus footage from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime has been revealed, and it looks pretty damn amazing in my eyes. 
The trailer, via Netflix, doesn&#x27;t give much away in terms of story beats, but it certainly sets the scene. There is neon, there is angst, there are explostions and gunfire a plenty and, oh yes, there are motorbikes.
Check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>Techland is waving farewell to its generous and long-lived post-launch support for the original Dying Light, after seven years.


The game&#x27;s Definitive Edition, which launches today, 9th June, is a digital collection of the whole game and all its 26 DLCs, including skin bundles and expansion packs, with a 70 percent discount. (A digital and physical version for Nintendo Switch will launch at a later date.)


Anyone currently holding a Platinum Edition of Dying Light will get upgraded to the Deluxe Edition for free, adding an additional five content dollops.

                              <span>An expansion for Forza Horizon 5 has been spotted on Steam, via a hastily-deleted store listing. 


The page revealed that Forza Horizon 5 &quot;Expansion 1&quot; would be: Hot Wheels. 


Yes, it&#x27;s another tie-in with the famous toy car brand, which has previously featured in Forza games, and also makes officially-licensed Forza car toys.

                              <span>With last night&#x27;s trailer reveal for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, fans of Activision&#x27;s largest franchise were left with sour taste after discovering the publisher has raised the price of last-gen versions of the game. 


Pre-ordering the game for either PlayStation 4 or Xbox One will cost players £69.99. That&#x27;s a hefty £10 increase from the asking for price for the franchise&#x27;s last title: Vanguard. 


The price rise is explained by the fact players are now forced to purchase the &quot;Cross-Gen Bundle,&quot; which includes both the last-gen and current-gen versions of the game.

                              <span>A new report into the development of Bethesda&#x27;s widely derided Fallout 76 has painted a picture of a studio in disarray, as poor management, a lack of design direction, and engine challenges created an environment of apathy, confusion, crunch, and burnout, and a game that ultimately failed to resonate with players.


Announced in 2018 and launched the following year, Fallout 76 - an online take on Bethesda&#x27;s beloved post-apocalyptic RPG series - was less than well-received at launch. Eurogamer&#x27;s Wesley Yin-Poole even went as far as to call it a &quot;bizarre, boring, broken mess&quot; before slapping it with an avoid badge.


Now, a lengthy new report from Kotaku - based on conversations with 10 former employees of Bethesda and parent company ZeniMax Media - has shed fresh light on the troubled development that lead to such a poorly received game, one seemingly doomed from the start.

                              <span>EA has responded to new claims Battlefield 2042 has entered &#x27;abandon ship&#x27; mode, insisting reports that only a skeleton crew is left working on the beleaguered shooter  are &quot;untrue&quot;.


Word that Battlefield 2042&#x27;s post-launch development has been dramatically downscaled was first shared by journalist Jeff Grubb on his Grubbsnax Giant Bomb show, where he claimed the remaining team has been tasked with delivering the four seasons of live service content promised to purchasers the &quot;fastest and the cheapest it possibly can&quot;.


&quot;This game is basically down to a skeleton crew,&quot; Grubb told viewers (thanks VGC). &quot;It&#x27;s down to like the bare bones and those people are specifically just working on the promised additional seasons that the game needs to meet the requirements of the high-end version that it sold.&quot;

Arcane Act 1, as season one was officially known, launched on Netflix last November, charting the early years of two of League of Legends&#x27; most popular champions, sisters Jinx and Vi, in an around the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun.


The response from critics and League of Legends fans was strong (Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell called it &quot;absolutely a thrill, full of welcome colour and life&quot;, despite a few reservations), and Riot confirmed a second season was in the works mere weeks after season one&#x27;s arrival.

                              <span>The PC version of Call of Duty returns to Steam five years after ditching the platform in favour of Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.net.


Activision today confirmed Infinity Ward&#x27;s upcoming shooter Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on Steam as well as Battle.net when it comes out on 28th October.


It marks the return of the shooter franchise to Valve&#x27;s platform five years after Sledgehammer&#x27;s Call of Duty: WW2 came out in November 2017. That game went down as the last new PC Call of Duty to appear on Steam, with all subsequent mainline games (Black Ops 4, Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War and Vanguard), as well as free-to-play battle royale Warzone releasing on Battle.net exclusively.

Lego Bricktales tasks players with traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they undertake various quests and puzzles dished out by NPCs to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


Bricktales&#x27; core puzzling is based around a brick-by-brick building mechanic that encourages players to find a solution to the task at hand by constructing something useful from a limited number of bricks - a bridge, perhaps, or a physics-based flying machine.

                              <span>Some players are finding themselves unable to access EA games on PlayStation and Xbox if their console accounts are tied to an EA account with an expired password.


The problem centres around the fact that many players created EA accounts in the distant past - for one reader who got in contact, it was over a decade ago - and tied it to an email address that has long since been shut down. For anyone with a now-abandoned school or work email, it&#x27;s a similar story. 


Now, when EA&#x27;s account system asks for a password reset, it can only send an email to that lost address.

                              <span>Following its reveal and subsequent delay, Evil West now has a solid release date. So, get your weapons and holsters ready, as we will be blasting off into a rather weird looking version of the Wild West on 20th September.
Along with this news, we also have a brand-new trailer to enjoy. Expect plenty of chaos to unfold here, as we meet gunslinging ornery cowboy type Jesse Rentier. 

 To my eyes, Evil West looks like a mashup of Red Dead Redemption and Resident Evil but with more lightning. See what you think  below.

                              <span>The co-op mode for Halo Infinite is at long last on its way. In fact, players will be able to give it a whirl from next month. 
However, there is a catch. This will just be its beta (or &quot;flight&quot; in the words of developer 343 industries), and not the real deal. That is still slated to come some time later this year.
If you want to have a shot at this test flight, you will have to register to become a Halo Insider. This program is the &quot;official way for Halo fans and community members to partner with 343 Industries to help improve our games, products, and services.&quot;

A &quot;significant number&quot; of staff have now been laid off in order to meet &quot;dramatically reined in operating costs&quot;, Intellivision boss Phil Adam wrote in an email to customers, which has in turn led to further issues. 


However, Intellivision appears to be adamant it will still release the Amico at some point.

It&#x27;s a similarly styled sim game, this time taking place in space - obviously. Players will construct a spaceship and go on adventures across multiple, procedurally generated star systems.


The team is quick to note the game is not even in alpha yet, but has released a lengthy video showing off gameplay with placeholder art - give it a watch below.

Former Giantbomb host Jeff Gerstmann discussed what he&#x27;d seen of the game last night via Twitch, and suggested it was far enough along in development it could potentially be revealed as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Showcase on Sunday. 


As for the game itself, which Gerstmann said was currently in testing, it puts players in command of a &quot;Steve-like&quot; unit that directs others to fight off Minecraft enemies such as Piglins.

This investment has been made via PIF&#x27;s subsidiary, the Savvy Gaming Group (SGG). Following this move, SGG will hold approximately 8.1 percent of the shares and 5.4 percent of the votes in the company.
Embracer now joins the likes of EA, Take Two Interactive, Capcom and Activision Blizzard, which the PIF also has stakes in.

                              <span>Alex Kipman, who led development on Microsoft&#x27;s HoloLens augmented reality headset as well as the Kinect motion controller for Xbox, has left the company. This comes following reports of both verbal abuse and sexual misconduct from the company exec. 
While Microsoft has not yet commented on his departure, an internal email sent on Tuesday and seen by Geek Wire confirmed Kipman&#x27;s exit, framing it as a company restructure. 
Within the email, head of Microsoft&#x27;s Cloud and AI Group Scott Guthrie said the changes being made &quot;will align and further accelerate [Microsoft&#x27;s] overall Metaverse efforts as a company this coming fiscal year&quot;.

                              <span>Apple&#x27;s incoming iOS 16 operating system will natively support Nintendo&#x27;s Switch Pro controller and Joy-Con.


Already in developer testing before a full public rollout this autumn, iOS 16 will allow you to use Nintendo&#x27;s controllers to play games - or do anything else app makers might imagine. 


The addition of Switch controller support follows the inclusion of support for both the PlayStation 5 DualSense and the Xbox Series X/S controllers last year, as part of iOS 14.5.

                              <span>Nintendo is reportedly figuring out what to do with a completed sequel to party game 1-2-Switch that has &quot;tested horribly&quot; among its target audience.


According to Fanbyte writer Imran Khan, citing multiple sources familiar with the game&#x27;s development, Nintendo made the decision to begin work on a 1-2-Switch sequel - reportedly known as Everybody&#x27;s 1-2-Switch - after the the original shifted a respectable 3.45m copies.


After several iterations, Nintendo is said to have settled on an idea inspired by the Jackbox Party Pack series for its 1-2-Switch sequel, where multiple players (up to 100 in some cases) could use their smartphones to compete in game-show-like mini-game challenges hosted by a man in a rubber horse mask. Reportedly, this somewhat radical shift in focus for the series was to ensure a too-similar sequel didn&#x27;t eat into the original mini-game compilation&#x27;s ongoing sales.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Bend Studio, the developer perhaps best known for 2019&#x27;s post-apocalyptic bikes-and-zombies adventure Days Gone, has revealed a little more on its next project, a new IP that&#x27;ll include multiplayer and build on the open-world systems of Days Gone.


The Oregon-based studio - which worked on the likes of Syphon Filter, Resistance: Retribution, and Uncharted: Golden Abyss, and was acquired by Sony in 2000 - shared word on its latest venture in a PlayStation Blog post unveiling its new logo.


Bend&#x27;s new logo, designed to represent an &quot;abstract and modern interpretation of the studio&#x27;s history, location, and lifestyle&quot;, is accompanied by a closer look at the developer&#x27;s output over the last 29 years, culminating with a tease of its future.

                              <span>As if Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest wasn&#x27;t enough Fest to be getting on with, Valve has starting cranking the hype handle for its own Fest, Steam Next Fest, which returns for another demo-packed seven days starting Monday, 13th June.


This latest tumble into demo-land was confirmed by Valve back in March, when it promised &quot;hundreds&quot; of &quot;cool demos&quot; throughout the week, alongside developer livestreams, chats, and other assorted activities.


Proceedings get underway at 6pm BST/10am PT next Monday, 13th June, and will continue until the following Monday, 20th June. That&#x27;ll give you seven days to gorge on as many demos as possible (an increasingly daunting proposition the bigger Steam Next Fest gets), after which they&#x27;ll disappear once more.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima, designer of the legendary Metal Gear series and 2019&#x27;s Death Stranding, is reportedly working on a new horror game starring actress Margaret Qualley called Overdose.


That&#x27;s according to ceaseless leaker Tom Henderson, who, writing for Try Hard Guides, claims to have been sent early footage featuring a character - portrayed by Qualley, who previously played Mama in Death Stranding - roaming through dark corridors with a flashlight in her hand.


Henderson says the sequence (displayed from a third-person perspective, although a first-person mode is also rumoured) culminates in a jump scare that brings a Game Over message up on screen. That&#x27;s reportedly followed by the caption &quot;A Hideo Kojima Game... OVERDOSE&quot;.

                              <span>With E3 yet again absent from the gaming calendar and Geoff Keighley readying to return this week with his Summer Game Fest alternative, the ESA has re-emerged with a reminder it&#x27;s planning to bring E3 back as both a digital and in-person event next year.


E3&#x27;s future has been looking increasingly uncertain in recent times, given the ESA&#x27;s continuing struggle to adequately adapt the show in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The event has been cancelled twice in the last three years - first in 2020 and again this year - with 2021&#x27;s virtual event proving to be a decidedly lacklustre affair.


But even before coronavirus, E3&#x27;s domination of the gaming calendar was growing ever-more wobbly, as an increasing number of publishers - including Sony, EA, and Activision - all abandoned the show in order to focus on their own bespoke events outside of the E3 umbrella.

Mojang originally announced Deep Dark almost two years ago, back at Minecraft Live in 2020. At the time, the biome was set to be part of the game&#x27;s 2021 Caves and Cliffs Update (an offering that was further reshuffled after Caves and Cliffs was split in two). So, why the delay? What&#x27;s been happening with Minecraft in the interim? And what&#x27;s going on with that Jason Momoa Minecraft movie? I sat down with Minecraft&#x27;s game director Agnes Larsson and gameplay developer Ulraf Vakninthe to find out more.


&quot;We felt for a while &#x27;this is a risk but we might be able to do it&#x27;,&quot; Larsson told me, of Deep Dark&#x27;s original intended release date. &quot;But then when we realised [we had to delay], we tried to take the decision really quickly because we would risk making people in the team very, very stressed out. And we also communicated about it really quickly because we wanted to be as transparent as possible about such a big decision.

                              <span>Korean studio NCSoft has released a trailer for its forthcoming dramatic thriller Project M.


Developed in Unreal Engine 5 and releasing on console, the team is aiming for ultra-realistic graphics - and it&#x27;s certainly achieving that.


Judging by a blog post accompanying the trailer, NCSoft appear to be using 3D scanning, motion capture, and special effects, resulting in some incredibly detailed character models. You can see it in action in the trailer below.

Shantae director Matt Bozon revealed this news on the PlayStation blog, where he shared a trip down the series&#x27; memory lane in honour of its 20th anniversary. 
Here, he revealed that Shantae was first conceived by his wife, Erin Bozon, in a bid to get more women and girls into video games.

                              <span>Court documents detailing the sentencing of Nintendo game pirate Gary Bowser have shed new light on how his 40-month sentence was designed to deter others from similar crimes.


Back in February, Bowser was told he would serve 40 months behind bars - more than three years - after pleading guilty to his part in the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices.


Now, newly-detailed documentation dug up by Axios and Kotaku has revealed how Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers and US district judge Robert Lasnik discussed Bowser&#x27;s jail time as a means to set an example - even as Bowser&#x27;s own lawyers argued his physical health was at risk, and argued that Bowser had already spent 16 months locked up awaiting trial.

The studio&#x27;s first game, Darwin&#x27;s Paradox, is a platform adventure game for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S that draws inspiration from Inside, Limbo, and Little Nightmares for a game &quot;filled with humour and influenced by the Golden Age of the 1950s science fiction and today&#x27;s 3D animation feature films&quot;.


It&#x27;s being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and will be released in early 2024.

But once again that&#x27;s gone too far, as classified documents of the DTC10-125 Chinese anti-tank missile have been leaked by fans in a further bid for realism.

                              <span>A new mod is adding some missing Greek gods to Hades, starting with Apollo, the god of music.


Modder AlexKage is behind OlympusExtra, available now on NexusMods (thanks Games Radar), which aims to add new gods, boons, voices and more.




Apollo, the first to be added, is the god of music - though he&#x27;s often also associated with the sun, as he took over riding its mythological golden chariot from Helios.

                              <span>While Fortnite may be free from the woes of the cryptocurrency marketplace, the same can&#x27;t be said for the rest of the Epic Games Store. In fact, a new NFT-riddled nightmare is on its way to Epic&#x27;s shopfront imminently.
The game in question is called Grit and, well, it looks a lot like something that rhymes with grit but that I am too polite to write here. 
At its Galaverse convention yesterday, developer Gala Games revealed it had &quot;signed a partnership with Epic&quot;, presumably to release the title via its storefront. Gala then went on to chat more about Grit, its wild-west themed battle royale which you can see in the trailer above.

                              <span>A group of quality assurance (QA) contractors working on BioWare&#x27;s next Dragon Age game have voted to unionise. 


The decision - unanimously agreed by all 16 voters at Keywords Studios - means collective bargaining on worker rights will now begin. 


This drive for unionisation comes amid a wider push for video game worker unions in the US, and after a previous squabble between staff and Keywords bosses over returning to work in-office.

                              <span>The Final Fantasy 14 development team considered adding a battle royale mode to the MMO.


In a recent interview with Japanese outlet Gamer (transcribed on Reddit), producer and director Naoki Yoshida discussed development of the recently added Crystalline Conflict PvP mode.


One idea was a battle royale mode featuring only blue mages - the unique job that learns skills and magic by battling enemies.

The Capcom Showcase will run for around 35 minutes, and feature &quot;news and in-depth updates&quot; on &quot;previously-announced Capcom titles&quot;.


That&#x27;s a nice bit of expectation-setting, then - don&#x27;t expect reveals of unannounced games. Then again, there&#x27;s still plenty Capcom has now revealed which it can discuss in more detail: including the &quot;reimagined&quot; Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6.

&quot;There isn&#x27;t a Fortnite cryptocurrency,&quot; he stated &quot;The Twitter accounts promoting such a thing are a scam. Epic&#x27;s lawyers are on it.&quot;

                              <span>DICE will be revealing first gameplay of the beleaguered Battlefield 2042&#x27;s long-awaited Season 1 this Tuesday, 7th June, and there&#x27;s a new update promising &quot;hundreds of changes, bug fixes and quality of life improvements&quot; due on the same day.
DICE has, of course, been steadily working to improve Battlefield 2042 since its launch last November, when it quickly become one of Steam&#x27;s worst-reviewed games of all time. While the developer has committed to bringing this latest Battlefield &quot;up to the highest standards that we all hold for the franchise&quot;, it&#x27;s only now, some eight months after its release, that players will finally get a first look at the game&#x27;s long-delayed first season of post-launch content.
Those curious to see what DICE has in store for Battlefield 2042&#x27;s first season, known as Zero Hour, will be able to see its gameplay premiere tomorrow, Tuesday 7th June at 4pm/8am PDT.

                              <span>Acclaimed point-and-click specialist Wadjet Eye Games - the studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the celebrated Blackwell series - has unveiled its latest contribution to the genre, time-travelling adventure Old Skies.


Old Skies cast players as Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers who&#x27;ve paid for a sightseeing jaunt to the past. &quot;Some are simply curious,&quot; explains Wadjet Eye. &quot;Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It&#x27;s only time travel, after all.&quot;


Wadjet Eye is promising seven distinct time periods from history to explore - &quot;from the speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age to the morning of September 11th&quot; - with puzzles set to take advantage of the game&#x27;s temporal premise.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s live-action adaptation of Capcom&#x27;s survival horror classic Resident Evil has received another trailer ahead of its 14th July release.


The new live-action series - not to be confused with Netflix&#x27;s four-episode CGI effort Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, which launched last year - splits its Racoon-City-focused storyline across two distinct timelines, straddling either side of a global apocalypse caused by a deadly virus.


At one end, pre-apocalypse, we follow the adventures of teenage sisters Jade and Billie Wesker as they begin to notice strange things are afoot in New Racoon City. Then, 14 years later in 2036, Jade takes centre-stage as she struggles to survive in a world overrun by the blood-thirsty infected and ponders the fate of her sister.

                              <span>We&#x27;re on the cusp of 2022&#x27;s not-E3 week, with the main event set to be this Thursday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest livestream. Ahead of its airing, however, host Geoff Keighley has warned viewers expecting major reveals to &quot;manage your expectations&quot;, saying the event will be &quot;primarily focused&quot; on already announced games.


Speaking during a Twitter Spaces audio session over the weekend (as transcribed by VGC), Keighley said he was &quot;very excited&quot; about the titles set to feature during Thursday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, but warned viewers to &quot;definitely manage your expectations in terms of the megaton shocks that you’re expecting. This is not The Game Awards.&quot;


&quot;We’ve got lots of good stuff to show you,&quot; he added, &quot;but buyer beware of some of the crazy rumours I&#x27;m seeing out there in terms of things people expect to get announced.&quot;

                              <span>The climbing mechanic in Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End almost saw lithe hero Nathan Drake come with his own little stamina bar in a bid to give an extra layer of difficulty to the game.
Naughty Dog&#x27;s Josh Scherr, who co-wrote A Thief&#x27;s End with Neil Druckmann and then went on to co-write The Lost Legacy, was a guest on YouTube channel Couch Soup over the weekend. Here, Scherr shared more about his illustrious career with Naughty Dog (which has spanned over 20 years) and gave some behind the scenes insight into Uncharted 4&#x27;s development.
Scherr praised the power of PlayStation 4, and said it was &quot;specifically designed to not be super complicated with a cell processor and six SPUs and all that other crazy stuff&quot;, likening it to a &quot;fancy version of a high-end PC&quot;. This means more time for developers to focus on other areas of a game sooner, such as its story development.

                              <span>The hashtag #DelaySonicFrontiers has been trending following the game&#x27;s first gameplay reveal.


First unveiled at the end of last year, fans have been desperate to see gameplay of Sonic Frontiers ever since. Two videos have now been released exclusively to IGN, showcasing the game&#x27;s open world design and its combat.


But so far fans are unhappy with the direction of the game and - just as with Sonic&#x27;s redesign for the film series - are calling for a delay.

                              <span>Monster mobile hit Pokémon Go has now earned more than $6bn in revenue, according to reliable app store analytics firm Sensor Tower. 


Six years on, Pokémon Go remains one of the most popular and profitable mobile games around the world - with more than 1.3m monthly players in the UK alone. 


US players have spent the most ($2.2bn) on Pokémon Go since its launch in the summer of 2016, followed by players in Japan and Germany.

                              <span>EA has issued a statement of support, primarily for LGBTQ+ rights, ahead of this month&#x27;s Pride celebrations. 
The message, from chief people officer Mala Singh, follows internal criticism of EA by some employees for not speaking out sooner in support - as other game developers have. 
&quot;I want to acknowledge the pain and fear that our LGBTQ+, specifically our Transgender community, is experiencing in light of emerging legislation in the US and the ongoing attacks on their human rights,&quot; Singh wrote in post shared on EA&#x27;s blog. &quot;We will continue to strive for a safe and supportive workplace, and as a leadership team, we want to be clear about what we stand for:

                              <span>The Nintendo 64 had some of the greatest games of our time on it. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, for example, was the first game ever to receive a perfect score of 40/40 in Famitsu magazine and was recently added to the Video Game Hall of Fame. 
However, while great, these games are a product of their time, and as such can look a little rough around the edges. Well, not anymore!
Now, thanks to an emulator developer that goes by the name of Darío, these legendary games have been given not only ray-tracing upgrades, but also object motion blur, widescreen, DLSS and 60+ FPS.

                              <span>The dust has settled on a fresh Fortnite season, following this weekend&#x27;s explosive live event. After an awkwardly-timed season focused on all-out warfare, the next few months will bring relative calm to Epic&#x27;s battle royale island.


Chapter 3 Season 3, subtitled as &quot;Vibin&#x27;&quot;, offers a more relaxed aesthetic, with the Island&#x27;s survivors celebrating their hard-won victory with a party. Last season&#x27;s underground base is now a giant rave cavern, with a rollercoaster you can ride using the game&#x27;s returning Baller vehicles (think those spheres from Jurassic World). 


A large chunk of the Island has also been transformed into a punk-fantasy jungle, with an enormous bioluminescent tree you can scamper around.

The new season of the free-to-play portal-hopping shooter brings a number of updates, including three new game modes and a remastered Abyss map.


That&#x27;s on top of revamped matchmaking as part of a migration to a new server, which means getting into matches quicker, fewer bots, and more similarly-skilled opponents.

One is a video game (coming in the latter half of 2022), and one is a TV show (coming early 2023), and both see a group rallying together to fight the crime in Gotham following Batman&#x27;s demise. 
However, despite sharing a name, an overarching concept and a pretty close launch window, these two have no relation to each other what&#x27;s so ever. Huh.
&quot;Message from the Belfry: the #GothamKnights game and the upcoming TV show of the same name are separate projects with no connection to one another,&quot; Batman Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Montreal tweeted. &quot;We can&#x27;t wait for you to experience the action of our Gotham Knights soon.&quot;

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Go Fest, Pokémon Go&#x27;s annual summer weekend extravangaza, has shaken up the game with the introduction of a new Mythical creature, the arrival of the franchise&#x27;s extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts, and the apparent (albeit likely temporary) loss of everyone&#x27;s favourite hunky professor, Willow.


The disappearance of Willow, a surprise twist for the game&#x27;s second day, means the game has been left without its usual friendly face guiding players through the game&#x27;s story. A mysterious stranger named Rhi, who looks to be a new ally, has instead taken Willow&#x27;s place while players investigate the emergence of the first Ultra Beasts. 


These creatures are likely the cause of Willow&#x27;s absence, and will hopefully be a continued focus over the game&#x27;s new Season of Go. For now at least, Willow&#x27;s absence appears to be a story development that will stick for some time, with standard in-game text changed throughout the app to remove references to the professor. (For those overly concerned, a Go Fest finale event for existing ticket holders, coming in August, seems likely to revolve around his revival.)

                              <span>Sega producer Yosuke Okunari has confirmed that the reason the company didn&#x27;t pursue creating a mini Dreamcast or Saturn because &quot;both developing and manufacturing new chipsets during the pandemic is a difficult and expensive process&quot;.

In an interview with Famitsu, Okunari said - as paraphrased by Gosokkyu (thanks, NintendoLife) - the company did &quot;explore the idea&quot; of a Dreamcast or Saturn Mini but ultimately decided not to pursue it when Sega discovered manufacturing mini consoles had become more expensive post-pandemic (and post semiconductor shortage, of course).

Okunari added that the Mega Drive Mini&#x27;s internals &quot;can&#x27;t adequately handle Saturn games&quot;, and manufacturing new chipsets would be prohibitively expensive, joking that if they&#x27;d proceeded with the idea, the cost of buying a Dreamcast of Saturn Mini could rival that of a modern-day console.

In the wake of the game&#x27;s appearance on Thursday&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play presentation, images purporting to be of 22 Street Fighter 6 characters - many of whom had yet to be formally revealed - popped up online, including all eight World Warriors from Street Fighter 2.

That wasn&#x27;t all, though - the leak also included video clips of the characters, too.

As spotted by our pals over at VGC, Xbox achievement tracker TrueAchievements has been tracking the unlocked - and public - achievements of BIGsheep, an alleged Rare developer who has been working through the game since October 2021.
After a brief hiatus between February and April, the dev has most recently unlocked an achievement called &quot;Merciless&quot;, which awards you for killing an unarmed player in multiplayer.

                              <span>It costs £88,000 ($110,000) to fully upgrade a character in Diablo Immortal.

That&#x27;s according to Bellular News (thanks, GameRant), which has calculated that to fully max out a character, a player would need to spend over $100,000 on microtransactions, as it&#x27;s seemingly not possible to do so without spending real money. You can check out the full breakdown below:

Players in Diablo Immortal have three progression pillars: XP level, equipment level, and Legendary Gems. The first two are pretty standard fare in any RPG-type game, but collating Legendary Gems can be a costly and convoluted process as the way you get them is randomised and often exceedingly rare... and right now, it seems as though F2P players cannot earn them at all.

                              <span>Amazon Games has entered into a new publishing agreement with Disruptive Games, a Californian indie studio, to publish its &quot;upcoming online multiplayer action-adventure game&quot;.

The press release stops short of detailing much else about the upcoming game - details will be &quot;revealed at a later date&quot;, apparently, although a quick snoop on Disruptive&#x27;s website hints that it&#x27;s coming to PC as well as unspecified PlayStation and Xbox consoles - but Disruptive Games has worked on several notable titles, including Diablo II: Resurrected, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, and Godfall. 

The studio says it is now focused on &quot;multiplayer-first gaming experiences that immerse players in living worlds&quot;.

                              <span>More reports have surfaced suggesting upcoming PS5 game Abandoned is &quot;not actively being worked on&quot; and &quot;there is no game&quot; in development.

The claims come from GameSpot , which alleges it has information directly from a private Discord server through which Hasan Kahraman of Blue Box Game Studios, Abandoned&#x27;s director, communicates with a handful of selected fans. 

In exchange for access to &quot;screenshots, animations, and even a page of the game&#x27;s script&quot;, the members are required to sign a NDA, so some would only speak about the project under strict anonymity. Should any member of the server press Kahraman - who is described as &quot;duplicitous and prone to mood swings&quot; - for clarification or more details, they risk being banned from the small community.

                              <span>It looks like pre-orders for Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns are about to go live ahead of an October release date.

That&#x27;s according to a new leak - which the source insists was obtained via an anonymous online retailer - that seemingly backs up prior claims that the game is set to release on 6th October and will be available in three flavours: a standard, enhanced, and legendary edition.

The claims may have flown entirely under the radar, but the images accompanying the leaker&#x27;s tweets - thought to have been box art - have all been zapped with a copyright notice from a senior legal assistant at Take-Two, leading many to believe they are genuine.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s latest season has concluded with this year&#x27;s first big live event, as the battle royale Island&#x27;s heroes aimed to end the villainous Imagined Order faction for good. 


Starting off the event, players found themselves in groups of up to four people inside Fortnite&#x27;s bear mech for the first time. Here, you could peer out from its bridge and onto an unfamiliar landscape - an icy moon which orbits the main Fortnite Island - and play around with gun turrets while listening to brief audio chatter between heroes Jones (Troy Baker), The Origin (Rahul Kohli) and The Foundation (Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson).


With a minute to go, a mission briefing finally re-introduced the mech&#x27;s pilot The Paradigm and laid out the stakes: the evil IO were set to detonate a superweapon capable of killing everyone, and it was up to you inside the mech to stop it. (Never mind that this is your goal in each battle royale match.) So off we went, blasting into space, through an asteroid field, and towards our best view of the Fortnite island floating through the multiverse yet.

The reimagined version of Capcom&#x27;s survival horror classic Resident Evil 4 kicked off yesterday&#x27;s State of Play showcase with an eye-catching trailer, complete with a release date: 24th March 2023.

The reveal teaser also included something else: a disclaimer, stating &quot;Leon&#x27;s brown sheepskin leather bomber jacket appears with permission from Schott NYC&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced it is &quot;no longer targeting a FY23 release&quot; for its troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.
Following rumours that The Sands of Time remake - which has moved release date several times now - was being delisted at some major retailers, Ubisoft released a brief statement confirming the game has formally been &quot;delisted&quot; as the game&#x27;s latest development studio, Ubisoft Montreal &quot;continue[s] the work to deliver a great remake&quot;.

The Sands of Time remake was being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai, but the project has been dogged by setbacks since its unveiling in September 2020. Shortly after its announcement, Ubisoft moved its launch date from January 2021 to March that same year, but February brought a second delay, this time indefinitely, while the team worked on delivering &quot;a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original&quot;.

                              <span>Sega has unveiled Mega Drive Mini 2, its latest mini retro console.

Last week, Sega hinted it had a big &quot;new project&quot; to share with us this week, teasing that the broadcast would reportedly include appearances from Hiroyuki Miyazaki and Yosuke Okunari. Given the guests, it wasn&#x27;t a stretch to presume the secret new project may have something to do with a new Sega retro console - and it turns out that&#x27;s exactly what Sega was teasing.

As yet, we don&#x27;t have any information on English social media, but the reveal has been posted to Sega Japan&#x27;s official YouTube channel, which you can check out below:

The demo gives players their first taste of gameplay and the unique abilities of the game&#x27;s 10 playable characters, but online team battles are only available during specific hour-long sessions throughout the weekend, with the next being at noon UK time.

The demo&#x27;s available now to download if you have a Nintendo Switch Online Subscription (those without one can sign for a seven-day free trial). Online team battles allow you to team up with friends online to challenge others - with a maximum of four players per team across two consoles - as well as random competitors.

Instead of &quot;participating&quot; in Cologne, Nintendo states that &quot;instead, players will be able to try out the games for Nintendo Switch at numerous events throughout Germany&quot;.

&quot;Gamescom is a key event in Nintendo’s calendar of events,&quot; Nintendo said in a statement to Games Wirtschaft (thanks, VGC). &quot;This year, however, after careful consideration, we have decided against participating in Cologne.

The Sims 4 Werewolves Game Pack - which releases on Steam, Origin, and Xbox on 16th June - brings &quot;unique temperaments and abilities, be affected by the phase of the moon, and experience wolf-specific life events&quot;.

It&#x27;ll be welcomed news for Simmers who may have been disappointed that werewolves were not part of the recent update, despite EA teasing that werewolves might finally be making a return to the series for the first time since The Sims 3&#x27;s Supernatural expansion.

                              <span>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield&#x27;s very Dead-Space-like sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol finally has a release date and is heading to PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC on 2nd December this year.


The Callisto Protocol, which was officially unveiled back in December 2020, is a third-person horror game set in 2320. Its action unfolds within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto, and - needless to say - suffocating terror and &quot;terrifying secrets&quot; ensue.


We&#x27;ve only seen a single cinematic of The Callisto Protocol since its intriguing 2020 reveal, so it&#x27;s nice to finally, properly see the thing in action courtesy of its brand-new release date trailer - which includes a smattering of gameplay - below. It looks like appropriately atmospheric, deliciously icky stuff - and, yes, not entirely dissimilar to Dead Space.

Naoki Yoshida introduced a new trailer for the game at the PlayStation State of Play you can watch below, which gave us a fresh look at the game&#x27;s story and gameplay.


In particular it showcased the game&#x27;s cast of summons, or Eikons as they&#x27;re known, their names chanted in the music if you listen carefully: Phoenix, Titan, Garuda, Ramuh, Shiva, Odin, Bahamut, and Ifrit.

                              <span>Guerilla Games has offered a first proper look at Horizon Call of the Mountain for PSVR2, alongside news that a free update for Horizon Forbidden West on PS4 and PS5 is now available, adding an ultra hard difficulty, New Game+, and more.


Horizon Call of the Mountain, which was announced back in January, is a first-person experience set the series&#x27; gorgeous, post-apocalypse world. It casts players as a new character -  Ryas, a former Shadow Carja Warrior who hopes to redeem himself by investigating a grave threat to the Sundom - and sets them on an adventure featuring main series protagonist Aloy and a host of other familiar faces.


Call of the Mountain&#x27;s new trailer, revealed during tonight&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, offers a first proper look at the game in action - including some of the activities players will be able to partake in using Sony&#x27;s upgraded VR kit, such as archery and mountain climbing - and it would be an understatement to say it all looks spectacular indeed.

In a blog post, BioWare touched on the subtitle, which is an alias of Dragon Age: Inquisition party member Solas.

&quot;Solas, the Dread Wolf,&quot; reads the official blurb. &quot;Some say he might be an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people... or a saviour who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world.

The core idea is to take advantage of the electromagnetic signals to execute basic touch events such as taps and swipes into targeted locations of the touchscreen with the goal of taking over remote control and manipulating the underlying device.
The attack, which works from a distance of up to 40mm, hinges on the fact that capacitive touchscreens are sensitive to EMI, leveraging it to inject electromagnetic signals into transparent electrodes that are built into the touchscreen so as to register them as touch events...</span>

                              <span>Casting for Sony&#x27;s live-action Twisted Metal series continues, with the news that Will Arnett - known for the likes of BoJack Horseman, The Lego Batman Movie, and Arrested Development - will voice the role of insane clown Sweet Tooth.


According to Variety, the show&#x27;s version of the iconic Sweet Tooth is a &quot;hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning. A lover of chaos, this majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses &#x27;Lost Vegas&#x27; as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck.&quot;


The Twisted Metal series - a half-hour action comedy scripted by Cobra Kai writer Michael Jonathan Smith for Peacock - follows a motor-mouthed outsider, played by Anthony Mackie, who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland dominated by savage marauders driving vehicles of destruction.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s brief gameplay tease, Sega has released a considerably more substantial seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay, offering a much clearer look at how the hedgehog&#x27;s first foray into open-world platforming will likely play out.


Yesterday&#x27;s footage was perhaps most notable for the rather muted art style Sega has opted for this time around, with the game - at least from what we&#x27;ve seen so far - placing Sonic in a realistically hewn world that almost feels closer to the sodden, boulder-pocked hillsides of Death Stranding than it does the colour-blasted Sonic backdrops of old.


We get to see a lot more of that expansive landscape in Sega&#x27;s newly shared seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay (thanks IGN), with the bulk of the footage focused on leisurely exploration as Sonic roams around, solving puzzles to unlock new elements in the world.

                              <span>Velan Studios&#x27; competitive &quot;dodgebrawl&quot; game Knockout City has officially gone free-to-play.


Knockout City - which launched on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC last May - was initially published under the EA Originals label, but earlier this year Velan announced it would be taking over publishing duties and shifting to a free-to-play model starting with its sixth season.


Both the free version of Knockout City and Season 6: City of Tomorrow are now here, introducing, among other things, the new Boomerang Ball across all playlists, the Starfruit Special energy drink, the sci-flyer crew vehicle, a permanent new career contract, an expanded hideout area, various map improvements, and more, as detailed in today&#x27;s patch notes.

It&#x27;s in the works at Everguild, maker of the The Horus Heresy: Legions card game set during the all-encompassing Space Marine civil war that took place during the 31st millenium.
Warpforge is of course set in the 41st millenium. According to Everguild, &quot;several&quot; of the best-known armies from the grimdark setting are included at launch, with more set to be added alongside regular expansions.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000 is getting a retro first-person shooter heavily-inspired by old-school Doom.


Boltgun is a single-player FPS in which you play a Space Marine who shoots the living crap out of all the Chaos Space Marines and daemons of Chaos sprites who dare get in his way. Doomguy would be proud!


The fun video, below, starts off looking back at the &#x27;90s and retro Warhammer 40,000 miniatures through a pair of nostalgia goggles before ripping into some quickfire gameplay:

Saber Interactive&#x27;s Space Marine sequel was announced at last year&#x27;s The Game Awards with a fancy CGI trailer that confirmed the return of Ultramarines hard man Captain Titus, as well as a few GIFs&#x27; worth of gameplay.


The new trailer, below, includes talking heads from Saber discussing their passion for the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Titus actor Clive Standen pottering about in full motion capture get-up, as well as a handful of new blink-and-you&#x27;ll miss them clips.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal - Blizzard&#x27;s free-to-play take on its long-running dungeon crawler series - has started its global roll-out, and is now available to download on iOS and Android devices in certain territories.


First announced at BlizzCon in 2018 - where it was less than warmly received by attendees - Diablo Immortal takes place between the events of Diablo 2 and 3, adapting the classic dungeon crawling formula of its predecessors for mobile devices - which, among other things, means a free-to-play monetisation model based around in-app purchases.


Starting out in the city of Westmarch, players can adopt one of six classes - Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Crusader, Necromancer, or Demon Hunter - and journey out to explore eight areas along with other adventurers. Blizzard and co-developer NetEase have previously said additional zones, storylines, loot, and classes will be added over time.

                              <span>To celebrate Pride Month, Xbox is releasing a brand new controller design that incorporates 34 community flags.


The flags are in &quot;a fine, interwoven manner to celebrate the nuance, complexity, intersectionality, and strength of the many LGBTQIA+ communities&quot;, explains an Xbox Wire post.


Last year, Xbox created a limited number of Pride controllers but many players wanted it to be universally available. This year&#x27;s controller will therefore be customisable in the Xbox Design Lab.

For those who don&#x27;t know already, Autonauts is a game where you build and then train robots to automate the world around you. Sounds easy enough, but there is a catch. In short, these robots are only ever going to be as smart as you tell them to be.
It is up to you as the player to teach your bots what do. You will need to upgrade them and expand their brains as the game progresses, opening up their full operational potential. You can build dozens of different workerbots on your planet and make it a &quot;fully functioning home&quot; with their help. By fully functioning home, we are talking cooking, mining, construction, you name it.

Once enabled in the settings, players can access the mode and snap away. The team at Shedworks also have a photography competition planned, as noted in the latest update blog.


That same blog also details a number of other fixes and additions to the game. Most importantly, changes have been made to the camera to reduce motion sickness when riding vehicles.

                              <span>Life is Strange developer Dontnod&#x27;s supernatural mystery adventure Tell Me Why is free to download on Xbox and PC (via the Microsoft Store or Steam) in celebration of Pride Month. 


All episodes of the game were also free this time last year for the same reason. 

While the first episode is free all year round and the whole game is available on Xbox Game Pass, it&#x27;s nice to have the opportunity own the whole game to play on your own time.

                              <span>Nvidia has created a new map within Minecraft powered by RTX technology to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s  Platinum Jubilee. 


Built by artist Ushio Tokura, the map features a full recreation of Buckingham Palace and Pall Mall, along with a street party that includes bunting, cake, champagne and a game of pin the tail on the corgi (I hope they got permission from the council). 


The map took three designers 650 hours within two weeks to build, 45m blocks and covers a virtual area of roughly 830,000 square feet.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Pokémon Violet and Scarlet trailer has revealed key details about the upcoming Nintendo Switch games, such as a series-first ability to explore the game&#x27;s world in a party of four players. 


Speaking of the game&#x27;s world, this will be the first Pokémon role-playing game where you can freely explore the entire map from the off - and &quot;not in an order dictated by the story&quot;, as The Pokémon Company clarified today. 


&quot;Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet allow multiplayer gameplay with up to four players,&quot; The Pokémon Company said. &quot;Along with series staples, such as trading and battling Pokémon, you will be able to explore the various locations of the region in these games with other players. You can discover new Pokémon and explore unfamiliar areas with your friends and family, opening the door to an adventure more precious and fun than ever!&quot;

Today, however, Chucklefish released a handful of new screenshots showing more of Witchbrook in action - and still in development. First off, above, we have a literal witch and a brook. And ducks. 


Below, there&#x27;s a glimpse at the game&#x27;s garden area and greenhouse. Is this where herbology is taught? We can also see a variety of character models showing young witches and wizards from different backgrounds. Also a sleeping cat.

So, that all sounds very exciting, but what is this Boiling Point you speak of, Victoria? Well, I am so glad you asked.

                              <span>The new Frogger game from Konami will be hopping its way onto your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV (via Apple Arcade) on 3rd June.
Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins will unite players with the titular Frogger as he learns about the lost treasure of an ancient frog tribe (why are they ancient - your guess is as good as mine, but I&#x27;d say... maybe they croaked?). 
However, this is not all. Along with the promise of hidden riches, something else strange is going on, as &quot;an alarming number of froglets are disappearing around the world&quot;. You can check out the new trailer for Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins below.

                              <span>A new report commissioned by the Norwegian Consumer Council has concluded that loot boxes in games are &quot;exploitative and predatory.&quot; 


Consumer protection agencies in 18 European countries have backed the report and called for better regulation of video games. 


The report uses both FIFA 22 and Raid: Shadow Legends as case studies to demonstrate the &quot;wide arsenal of tricks to push consumers into spending as much time and money as possible exploiting consumers hope to receive the reward despite a miniscule chance and likelihood to do so&quot;.

                              <span>Parents of an Activision Blizzard employee who took her own life have dropped their lawsuit against the company.


Kerri Moynihan, a 32-year-old finance manager at Activision, died in 2017 while attending a company retreat. 


The incident publicly came to light as part of California&#x27;s still-ongoing lawsuit against Activision, filed last July,  which has alleged multiple instances of discrimination and misconduct at the company.

Iterating on the previous handheld, the slick white Evercade EXP features a faster processor on par with its home console equivalent Evercade VS, as well as a higher resolution screen, built-in WiFi, and a new pair of triggers.


In addition, Tate Mode will allow players to rotate the handheld for vertical play - the screen has been designed for this and the console includes extra buttons to accommodate the change in orientation.

                              <span>A skilled forger has been discovered after years of selling retro games and memorabilia to unsuspecting collectors. 
The Big Box PC Game Collectors group has ousted Enrico Ricciardi after several members came forward with counterfeit copies of classic games which they had purchased from Ricciardi. 
The group has now shared a public document (via Kotaku) detailing its investigation and subsequent evidence against Ricciardi. This document states: &quot;If you have received games from [Ricciardi], check them closely and compare with known originals. I advise to presume they are fake, because our investigation has unearthed quite a bit more alleged forgeries than real.&quot;

As we reported last year, Tekken 7 had sold 7m copies - adding another 2m in the last year shows sales are still going strong.

The remarks, posted publicly on Twitter overnight, reportedly follow an internal meeting within EA on LGBTQ+ issues, Kotaku reported. 


There, the publisher was again asked by employees whether it would make a public statement on these issues - and reportedly again kept to its previous line that these topics were subject to different points of view across the company.

For those of you out of the loop, I highly recommend you give Digital Foundry&#x27;s explainer a read, where Alex Battaglia explains it much more eloquently than I ever could. 


In short, FSR 2.0 is a suite of image upscaling technologies which let your PC run the game at a lower internal resolution, which is then reconstructed to be close to indistinguishable from its native resolution.

Having joined Squaresoft (as it was known)in 1995, Hashimoto later became the brand manager for the Final Fantasy series and co-creator of Kingdom Hearts.


He shared a message of his retirement on his Twitter, as well as a video message on the Square Enix account where he explained his love for meeting fans at events, something he&#x27;s sadly been unable to do due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

                              <span>Super Bomberman R Online is now going offline. Konami has announced its plans to &quot;terminate the service&quot; on 1st December across all platforms. 
In addition to this, Konami revealed that the sale of Bomber Coins and Premium Packs will end today (1st June), with the company asking for all unused Bomber Coins to be used &quot;before the end of the service&quot;.
Konami did not go into the specifics of why it has made this decision, only citing &quot;various circumstances&quot; as the catalyst for the service&#x27;s closure.

                              <span>There&#x27;s good news for all of you achivement hunters, as this month&#x27;s Xbox dashboard update will let you reveal the details of secret achivements. 


This should save quite a bit of time for completionists, who will no longer have to resort to Google in order to find the one pesky achievement that haunts your nightmares.


To find the hidden details, just open the Xbox Guide from within a game and go to Game Activity and then Achievements. After that, you just need to find the achievement you&#x27;re after and manually select to unhide it.

Author: Paris Pittman (Steering Committee)
Last year, we published our first Annual Report Summary for 2020 and it&#x27;s already time for our second edition!
2021 Annual Report Summary
This summary reflects the work that has been done in 2021 and the initiatives on deck for the rest of 2022. Please forward to organizations and indidviduals participating in upstream activities, planning cloud native strategies, and/or those looking to help out. To find a specific community group&#x27;s complete report, go to the kubernetes/community repo under the groups folder. Example: sig-api-machinery/annual-report-2021.md
You’ll see that this report summary is a growth area in itself. It takes us roughly 6 months to prepare and execute, which isn’t helpful or valuable to anyone as a fast moving project with short and long term needs. How can we make this better? Provide your feedback here: https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/242

                              <span>Yu Suzuki - the legendary designer behind the likes of Sega classics Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, OutRun, and Space Harrier - has unveiled new 3D shooter Air Twister, which is making its way to Apple Arcade on 24th June.


Air Twister is a fantasy &quot;swipe&quot; shooter - developed by Shenmue 3 studio YS Net - that asks players, in the role of Princess Arch, to battle alien invaders and save their planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


As the trailer reveals, there&#x27;s a definite Space Harrier vibe to the whole thing - with a touch of Panzer Dragoon thrown in when our lead takes to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and, according to an interview attended by GameSpot, Air Twister is based on a fantasy shooting game Yu Suzuki envisaged in the 80s, before he adapted the idea into Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

                              <span>Ofcom has published its annual report into the UK&#x27;s online habits - including plenty of stats for how many of us are now playing online games, paying for subscriptions, and trying to beat Wordle. 


39 percent of UK adults aged 16 or over play games online, Ofcom says, with 56 percent of children aged three to 15 playing games online. The average time spent each week playing games online was 7 hours and 33 minutes, including PC, console, VR and smartphone gaming.


These figures come from Ofcom surveys completed in late 2021, so after formal lockdowns had ended, Ofcom noted. In general, there was a dip in the amount of time younger people played online games year-on-year, though a growth in time spent playing online games for those aged 55-64.

                              <span>Adeline Software&#x27;s much-loved Little Big Adventure series can now be enjoyed with a welcome selection of modern day niceties - including cloud saves, controller support, and Steam achievements - thanks to a brand-new update on Steam.


The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. Needless to say, at now over a quarter of a century old, both were decidedly lacking in modern day polish.


Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to the series (and counts Little Big Adventure co-creator Didier Chanfray as a founder), announced it would be upgrading Little Big Adventure 1 &amp; 2 back in March, although there was no estimated time of arrival for its enhancements.

                              <span>Almost exactly one year after Sonic Frontiers&#x27; initial tease, Sega has returned with a new brand-new trailer offering our first, brief look at some gameplay for the hedgehog&#x27;s latest adventure.


Sonic Frontiers was first teased at the end of last May (with only the vaguest of CGI trailers and no name), but it wasn&#x27;t until December that first proper details emerged, with Sega describing the title as Sonic&#x27;s &quot;first ever open zone&quot; game.


&quot;Accelerate to new heights and experience the thrill of high velocity open-zone freedom,&quot; the publisher said at the time. &quot;Battle powerful enemies as you speed through the Starfall Islands - landscapes brimming with dense forests, overflowing waterfalls, sizzling deserts and more!&quot;.

The mode is essentially a campaign mode and was popular in the game&#x27;s previous iteration as Pro Evolution Soccer.


However, in an update thread on Twitter, Konami has stated this mode &quot;will be available as additional paid content during 2023&quot;.

                              <span>Get ready earthlings, Crypto is back (no, not that planet burning kind). THQ Nordic has revealed that Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is heading our way on 30th August, with alien invader Crypto - or to be more precise, the next Crypto: Cryptosporidium 138 - leading the charge (ok, so maybe &quot;that planet burning kind&quot; is actually still accurate...).
THQ has promised this release will be a faithful remake of 2006&#x27;s alien filled caper, complete with &quot;five huge open-world areas&quot;. These areas are Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and, what with this being a game with an out of this world entity roaming through its maps, the Moon. 
But, who exactly will players come across within these vast maps? Well, as Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is set in the swinging &#x27;60s, you will have to deal with more than a small handful of hippies on your quest for glory. Oh, yes, and there is also the small matter of the KGB as well. You can check out the latest trailer for Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed below.

&quot;On the 24th of February 2022, our Heart of Russia team was some six to eight weeks away from completing work on the highly anticipated new DLC. We all felt really good about the result; a lot of effort had been invested in making this new region look truly fantastic in the game,&quot; SCS shared in a blog post yesterday.
&quot;We were absolutely sure that our community, especially those in Russia, would really appreciate that. Then, all of a sudden, the entire world was rocked by the news that Ukraine had been invaded by Russia.&quot;

                              <span>Ni No Kuni: Cross Worlds, a smartphone MMO version of the beloved Studio Ghibli/Level-5 RPG series, is now available globally. 


But since its worldwide release, the game&#x27;s deep links to cryptocurrency and upcoming plans for NFTs have come under the spotlight (thanks, Kotaku).


Players can earn Territe, a currency which can then be exchanged for &quot;Territe Tokens&quot;, in game from monster battling, completing various daily missions and other grinding mechanics.

OK, well it sort of has. This new crossover actually adds customisations from 19 of Tekken 7&#x27;s characters for Virtua Fighter 5&#x27;s existing cast, so we are talking new costumes rather than any new moves. Either way though, it looks set to be a lot of chaotic fun.
You can check out the new trailer for the latest crossover below.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s mysterious cancelled Kirby GameCube platformer has been spotted in a (very brief) snippet of new gameplay footage. 


The video, posted to YouTube by Foulowe59, shows a montage of gameplay footage apparently filmed on Nintendo&#x27;s showfloor booth at E3 2005. 


It was there that the game was shown off in a demo reel, as part of various upcoming GameCube and Nintendo DS titles. Alas, as we now know, this Kirby never made it much further.

                              <span>French government officials are banning a number of anglicised gamer words to preserve the purity of the language.


The culture ministry has said the video game sector is rife with English words that could be &quot;a barrier to understanding&quot; for non-gamers, writes The Guardian.



That means that pro gamer becomes &quot;joueur professionnel&quot;, and streamer becomes &quot;joueur-animateur en direct&quot;.

                              <span>June&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation Plus titles have now leaked.
Coming from reliable source Deallabs, the PlayStation Plus games for June are reportedly  God of War (2018), Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. These games will be available from 7th June until 5th July.
Some have seen the inclusion of God of War as a hint that Sony may be looking to up the marketing for its sequel, God of War: Ragnarök. After all, the game is still slated to release some time this year, and that 2022 window is rapidly getting smaller and smaller (I for one can&#x27;t believe we are nearly in June already!).

                              <span>Interesting paper by Lennart Maschmeyer: “The Subversive Trilemma: Why Cyber Operations Fall Short of Expectations“:
Abstract: Although cyber conflict has existed for thirty years, the strategic utility of cyber operations remains unclear. Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict...</span>

SHB is a small, annual, invitational workshop of people studying various aspects of the human side of security, organized each year by Alessandro Acquisti, Ross Anderson, Alice Hutchings, and myself. The forty or so attendees include psychologists, economists, computer security researchers, sociologists, political scientists, criminologists, neuroscientists, designers, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, geographers, business school professors, and a smattering of others.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re watching the new Obi-Wan Kenobi series and want yet more backstory, it sounds like you could do a lot worse than read this month&#x27;s latest Star Wars novel, Brotherhood.


Brotherhood takes place during the Clone Wars, and stars both Anakin Skywalker and Kenobi off on another adventure. But it&#x27;s the novel&#x27;s cameos which have sparked some extra attention - seeing as they acknowlege a couple of well-known video games (thanks, GamesRadar). 


For starters, Brotherhood apparently includes a &quot;blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it&quot; appearance by Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order star Cal Kestis, who was but a youngling at the time of the novel&#x27;s events.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s long-awaited launch of Diablo Immortal has reportedly been scrapped in both Belgium or the Netherlands, due to the countries&#x27; laws around loot boxes.


An Activision Blizzard Benelux communications manager confirmed  the move to Dutch news site Tweakers, GamesIndustry.biz has reported, and cited &quot;the current operating conditions in these countries&quot;. Eurogamer has contacted Activision Blizzard here in the UK for comment. 


Pre-registration for the game&#x27;s mobile launch and PC beta has also now been withdrawn in both countries, it&#x27;s been claimed.

Now, one modder has gone further still, and added another handy little rune to Link&#x27;s Sheikah Slate.
The mod in question comes from sofiaharley and is dubbed the Flying Rune, or Cyclos. It basically acts like an overpowered version of Revali&#x27;s Gale, generating a wind current every time a player presses the rune button. 
&quot;Think of it like flapping your wings,&quot; explains sofiaharley. &quot;One little flap will only bring you up a little bit, but if you keep flapping you can go as high as you like!&quot;

                              <span>Fighting game fans are puzzled as to why SoulCalibur 2 HD - still available to play via Xbox 360 backwards compatibility - has become unavailable to buy on Xbox via the Microsoft Store. 


The removal was spotted over the weekend by Jon Cartwright and appears to be recent (thanks, VG247). SoulCalibur for the OG Xbox has also been delisted, it was noted, although this seems to have happened some time ago. 

SoulCalibur 2 HD now shows a &quot;not available separately&quot; message when attempting to buy the game via the Microsoft Store&#x27;s website - though it does not appear to be available elsewhere as part of any bundle - and &quot;not available at this time&quot; via Xbox consoles.

The trailer by Project Dream (spotted by TheGamer), proudly proclaims &quot;the adventure continues!&quot;
 This fan made threequel is set 22 years after the events of Banjo-Tooie and the defeat of Gruntilda. And, for a pretty decent period of time, everything seemed to be calm and collected for our heroes.

The sound library comprises music and sound effects from the 2006 DS games Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, launched back in February.


However, an announcement on the library page states it will shut down on 31st May. No data will be available to stream or download after this date.

                              <span>Microsoft has said it is unlikely to restore the Xbox&#x27;s &quot;Snap&quot; ability in a future update.


That&#x27;s according to Xbox engineering lead Eden Marie, who noted on Twitter that: &quot;While we all miss snap, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coming back.&quot;


Snap was a key feature - and one of the few selling points - of the Xbox One at its launch. The handy ability let you stick an app to one side of your screen while continuing to play games alongside.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has seen a record financial year, according to industry analyst Dr. Serkan Toto.



A filing in the Japanese government&#x27;s official gazette shows sales were up over 70 percent from the previous year to 204bn yen (US$1.6bn), while operating profit was at 59 billion yen (US$460m) and net profit rose 123 percent to 41bn yen (US$320m).




Of course, that&#x27;s down to some huge game releases over the fiscal year, including Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Pokémon Unite and New Pokémon Snap.

                              <span>Among the various announcements revealed this weekend as part of Star Wars Celebration, we got news of a Lego BD-1 from Respawn&#x27;s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (arguably the best thing about the game) headed our way.
The new model, which is set to release on 1st August, will have 1062 pieces, and on completion will stand at 31cm. And he won&#x27;t just be a static companion to add to your collection. Rather, he will have a head that can be &quot;tilted back, forward and sideways for maximum cuteness&quot;.
As well as the ability to pose BD-1, those who purchase their own little droid companion this summer will also get to experience other neat little inclusions, such as the back of BD-1&#x27;s head being translucent to show the droid&#x27;s mood and a display sign (see below). He probably won&#x27;t be able to heal you like he does for Cal, however.

                              <span>Artwork for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - yes, the new one - has popped up on Steam.

The discovery has fans speculating - and hoping - that this may mean that, after a seven year absence, Activision is moving away from battle.net exclusivity on PC and bringing its first-person shooter back to Valve&#x27;s PC client, Steam.

As spotted by u/Kalinine and posted to Reddit, the Modern Warfare 2 Ghost artwork &quot;show[ed] up on Steam&quot;. When pushed for clarification, the user added: &quot;it shows up at the bottom of the DLC page for some Call of duty games like Black Ops 3&quot;.

                              <span>Remember that Marvel MMORPG that we discovered had been recently cancelled? Well, now we can see what we&#x27;re missing courtesy of new screenshots uploaded to an artist&#x27;s portfolio on ArtStation.

Ramiro Galan - a principal designer at Pixelkings - shared a handful of never-before-seen images on their digital portfolio, showing off what appears to be the cancelled game&#x27;s character creation screen. 

&quot;Here is a series of styles and screens by Ramiro Galan for a cancelled Marvel MMO title,&quot; the album&#x27;s description tells us. &quot;Emphasis was on rich and vibrant colours with stylistic tones that pay homage to Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse. All design, 3D materials, lighting, and post process FX were done by Ramiro Galan.&quot;

                              <span>A dataminer has uncovered further references to Ruby and her Demon Spawn secreted within Evil Dead: The Game&#x27;s files.

Ruby - who hails from Ash vs. Evil Dead - has yet to make an appearance in the main game, and her absence from the roster was a surprising omission to some given the plethora of other characters from Evil Dead stories, both old and new.

Now - thanks to a second batch of datamined voice files from our hero roster - it seems like she will indeed be making an appearance, seemingly batting for the Demons in these particular scenarios, although it&#x27;s not totally beyond the realm of possibility that she may turn up as a survivor, too - hopefully we&#x27;ll get an official reveal soon.

                              <span>The company formerly known as THQ Nordic, Embracer Group, has announced new plans to preserve video games to &quot;archive and save as much of the video games industry as possible&quot;. 

&quot;For us, games are more than just games. Its culture!&quot; the company announced on the shiny new web page for the Embracer Games Archive (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;It is something created by great people with creative ideas. By building a large archive of physical games, we want to preserve and tribute the games culture for a long period of time.&quot;

While newly launched, the project has already successfully archived 50,000 &quot;games, consoles, and accessories&quot; at its hub in Karlstad, Sweden, and employs a CEO, archive assistant, technical engineer, and supply manager.

                              <span>The Russian version of Gotham Knights has allegedly been cancelled.

That&#x27;s according to The Happy Warrior, which says sources at Warner Bros. Montreal have confirmed the publisher has cancelled the Russian version &quot;due to the political fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine&quot;.

The rumour is further compounded by confirmation that Gotham Knight&#x27;s Russian sub-site has been taken offline; the URL now results in a 404 error (it was still live as at 12th May, according to archive.org). Similarly, the Steam page makes no mention of Russian-language support, hinting that both Russian voicework and subtitles have been removed (thanks, VGC).

The dataminer revealed that earlier this week, a private investigator turned up at their home and handed them a letter demanding that the leaker&#x27;s social media posts be removed. 

The letter - allegedly from PUBG developer Krafton - also wanted copies of PlayerIGN&#x27;s direct messages in order to decipher &quot;how [they] got said information&quot;.

Arenas come as part of the MMO&#x27;s latest update, which also ushers in expedition mutators, a Varangian Knights quest chain - where you can &quot;continue the story of the Varangian Knights and their conquest for power&quot; - a PvP rewards track, and &quot;a whole host of other updates&quot;.

&quot;Step into the Arena to test your skills against other combatants!&quot; Amazon explains in the game&#x27;s latest blog post. &quot;3v3 Arenas are a new small-scale PvP game mode where teams of three can face off for fame, glory, and riches. You might even win a few unique housing items.&quot;

                              <span>Change is afoot for Phasmophobia fans, and two new ghosts are on the way.

Development Preview #3 - now live for your reading pleasure on Steam, where the game is still available as an early access title - reveals what&#x27;s coming up in the next few weeks and months for the ghostbusting party game.

First up, two more ghost types are joining the spooky menagerie. The names on the reveal image have been intentionally smudged to keep us in suspense, but one says Morai or Morcai - maybe? - and the other, if you squint a bit, looks like Decogen. Or something beginning with D, anyway.

                              <span>SOC Investment Group has written an open letter to Activision Blizzard shareholders, urging voters not to re-elect six board members, including CEO, Bobby Kotick.

As spotted by GI.biz, the letter comes ahead of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s annual meeting on 21st June and campaigns to remove Bobby Kotick, Brian Kelly, Robert Morgado, Robert Corti, Barry Meyer, and Peter Nolan from their positions.

&quot;Each of these directors failed either to recognise that Activision Blizzard for years maintained unsafe workplaces exhibiting frequent and repeated sexual harassment, sexual assault, and gender discrimination, or to appropriately address the Company’s &#x27;frat house&#x27; culture once it was publicly revealed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) in its pending lawsuit, which was filed in July 2021,&quot; the damning letter states.

The early rollout is reportedly &quot;due to the nature of how mobile games rollout&quot; and will &quot;ensure a smooth launch&quot;. 

The game is also now available to pre-load on PC via Battle.net.

                              <span>Following a flurry of recent leaks, EA has officially unveiled Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sequel. It&#x27;s called Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and will be out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC some time next year.


While there&#x27;s little in the way of specifics to accompany today&#x27;s announcement, EA has confirmed the third-person action-adventure will once again follow the story of Fallen Order protagonist Cal Kestis, albeit five years after the events of the first game.


The teaser trailer released alongside today&#x27;s announcement doesn&#x27;t reveal a whole lot more, but we do see Cal, lightsaber in hand and accompanied by trusty robot sidekick BD-1, flexing his action muscles as he remains on the run from the Empire.

Kirby 64 launched as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Switch Online + Expansion Pack retro collection last week, and players soon began reporting a bug in underwater levels - not seen in the 2000 original - that permanently stunned them after taking damage from certain sources.


In response to those reports, Nintendo has now confirmed a fix is on the way. &quot;A bug has been found in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards for Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online that can prevent players from progressing under a certain condition,&quot; it wrote in a tweet.

                              <span>Over four months after publisher Bandai Namco pulled online PvP support for the Dark Souls series on PC following the discovery of a serious security vulnerability, FromSoftware has said it&#x27;s &quot;currently in the process of restoring&quot; the games&#x27; online servers.


PvP servers for Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 were &quot;temporarily deactivated&quot; back in January after reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying that &quot;due to the time required to set up proper testing environments, online services for the Dark Souls series on PC will not resume until after the release of Elden Ring&quot;. But with Elden Ring having been out in the wild for over two months now, the Dark Souls community was steadily to lose its patience as further updates failed to materialised.

                              <span>Dino park managers looking to wow their guests with a bit more variety might want to point their attention toward Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s newly announced Dominion Biosyn DLC when it launches for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 14th June, bringing, as it does, a selection of new exhibits inspired by the latest Jurassic World movie.


Taking its cue from the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion, Frontier&#x27;s latest blob of DLC for its park management sequel ushers in a star-studded cast, new features, and, of course, new dinosaurs, amounting to what the studio is calling the game&#x27;s &quot;biggest DLC to date&quot;.


First up, there&#x27;s a new campaign that&#x27;ll task players with constructing a Research Compound in multiple stages. This features the vocal talents of Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Campbell Scott in their respective big screen roles, and brings a new feature that&#x27;ll see players unearthing rare genomes in amber mines to create feathered prehistoric species.

                              <span>Pokémon Go has detailed its next in-game season, which will take the compulsive creature-catching app through the summer months. 


Beginning on 1st June and ending on 1st September, the perhaps unimaginatively named Season of Go will be heavily punctuated by the game&#x27;s key summer event: Go Fest. 


But, happily, there&#x27;s also more going on - including the recently-confirmed arrival of Pokémon&#x27;s mysterious extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts. Today, we got our first look at the jellyfish-like Nihilego popping up - appropriately via a wormhole.

                              <span>Square Enix is rolling back on recent balance changes to PvP in Final Fantasy 14.


Previous patch 6.11a included numerous balance adjustments, particularly to the black mage job, in addition to removing the automatic inactive log out.


However, following negative feedback from fans, producer and director Naoki Yoshida has admitted the team got the adjustments wrong.

The one downside? You can&#x27;t use Obi-Wan&#x27;s trusty lightsaber, which instead hangs limply from his trusty Jedi backpack. 


Fortnite has previously featured lightsabers as weapons - and very fun they are too. You can strike, block and perform a neat little combat roll while holding them, and players facing off against each other will often like to go one-on-one with you as a proper duel.

This is the question Nintendo asked us in the 90s, and now we are in the future we can once again answer. What will we do? Why,we will caper of course! Yes, that&#x27;s right, Congo&#x27;s Caper is now available for you to play in the here and now. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>Yesterday, Sony announced plans for a further swathe of PlayStation game adaptations, and noted it had greenlit both a Horizon Zero Dawn series for Netflix and a God of War show for Amazon.


There was also the briefest of confirmations for a more mysterious Gran Turismo project - and now, Deadline has provided a few more details. 


For starters, Sony&#x27;s plan for Gran Turismo is to turn it into a film, though work is still &quot;in very early development&quot;. Neill Blomkamp, director of District 13, is reportedly being &quot;eyed&quot; to helm the project.

                              <span>Mobile game Plague Inc has celebrated its tenth anniversary via a Reddit Q&amp;A with creator James Vaughan.


Over 180 million people have played the game since its release in May 2012, with a spike following the Covid-19 outbreak.


Asked how big the uptick in players had been since the pandemic, Vaughan replied: &quot;Interestingly, Plague Inc has always got more popular whenever people get ill, eg When Plague Inc was #1 in Japan - we saw big spikes every time there was a bad flu outbreak. When Ebola was spreading in 2015, we saw a big worldwide spike in players. When Covid first started though we saw the biggest increase in players ever - it lasted for about a month and then went back down to normal levels.

While the device, codenamed Keystone, has never formally been shown, earlier leaks pointed to a mini box similar to a shrunk down Xbox Series S, which acted as a hub for Ethernet, USB and HDMI ports.


Xbox&#x27;s plan - which still seems to be in place, albeit no longer in the immediate future - is to launch Keystone as a small gadget capable of streaming Xbox Game Pass titles to any monitor or TV screen with no extra console hardware required.

                              <span>Another round of layoffs has hit embattled Mafia 3 studio Hangar 13, with around 50 people affected. 


It follows an earlier round of job losses last November, when 200 positions were at risk, and the departure of the studio&#x27;s head Haden Blackman earlier this month.


These latest job losses will affect Hangar 13&#x27;s main location in California, Kotaku reported. Staff were informed remotely by Hangar 13&#x27;s new boss Nick Baynes, who ran the company&#x27;s Brighton location before succeeding Blackman as overall company head.

This will cover those hosting and those joining a game session. To try it out for yourself, all you need to do is select a game that supports the feature, then head over the Quick Access Menu and you should be ready to roll.
As well as updating this feature, users will now also get a message letting them know when their Deck is running out of space. A notification will pop up when there is less than 2GB of space remaining.

That included having players inside robots designed to look like burgers, bears, skulls, and more.

                              <span>Gotham Knights&#x27; development team has addressed the recent criticism surrounding its depiction of Barbara Gordon.
During a recent Q&amp;A, fans asked more about the development of Barbara, aka Batgirl. This was following a backlash to her character&#x27;s biography on the game&#x27;s website, which described her as training to &quot;recover from her wounds&quot; so that she could &quot;return to active duty as Batgirl&quot;.
In the comic books, Barbara Gordon is shot in the spine by Joker, leading to her using a wheelchair. While she may not have the exact same backstory in Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. previously stated Barbara was in a wheelchair following a &quot;face-off&quot;.

                              <span>Ever since its unveiling in 2020, Dead Space creator Glen Schofield&#x27;s sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol has conjured images of Dead Space, so it was a bit of a surprise when, due to various studio connections, it was announced the game would be set in the PUBG Universe. That, however, is no longer the case, with Schofield now saying it&#x27;s its &quot;own story and world&quot;.


The Callisto Protocol is a third-person horror game set in 2320, with its action unfolding within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto. While that set-up mightn&#x27;t immediately scream PUBG to onlookers, the connection came from the fact developer Striking Distance was explicitly established by PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton to create narrative-driven games that would expand the universe introduced in the battle royale hit.


As Schofield explained in a recent GameInformer cover feature on The Callisto Protocol, &quot;When we came in, [Krafton] had a lore team and they were writing this big story, like, &#x27;Where does PUBG start? Where does it fit in?&#x27;&quot;. Had those plans continued, the horror game would have sat &quot;pretty far out&quot; along the timeline, but somewhere during development the idea was dropped.

                              <span>Legendary actor Ray Liotta, who made a memorable impact on the world of gaming as the voice of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City protagonist Tommy Vercetti in 2002, has died aged 67.


Although Liotta only ever starred in one other game - Call of Duty: Black Ops 2&#x27;s DLC pack Mob of the Dead in 2013 - the actor had a long, enormously prolific career in both film and television, appearing in wide variety of productions, ranging from beloved baseball movie Field of Dreams to ER, and, more recently, Apple&#x27;s psychological thriller Black Bird.


Arguably his most iconic role, though, remains his 1990 breakthrough performance in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s movie classic Goodfellas, where he starred as real-life mobster Henry Hill alongside the likes of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.

                              <span>Minecraft&#x27;s long-awaited The Wild Update - which includes two new biomes, new mobs, and various other delights - finally has a release date, and will be launching on 7th June.


The Wild Update&#x27;s first major addition comes in the form of the new Mangrove Swamp biome, bringing mangrove trees and a new natural (and craftable) resource known as mud blocks. It also ushers in the highly anticipated Deep Dark biome, which was originally due to launch as part of the Caves &amp; Cliffs update before getting delayed.


The Deep Dark biome, as its name very much implies, is Minecraft&#x27;s deepest area to date, and is found beneath the game&#x27;s current bedrock layer. Here, curious adventures will uncover remnants of a ruined civilisation as well as creepy, eyeless mobs known as Wardens. These fearsome foes react to vibrations, meaning stealth is the key to survival, and can also be summoned if careless explorers stumble into the new Shrieker traps.

                              <span>Budding urban planners that somehow still haven&#x27;t found their way toward Colossal Order&#x27;s enormously entertaining city builder Cities: Skylines now have no excuse. You can pick up the base game and almost all its DLC on PC for around £16 in the latest Humble charity bundle.


Cities: Skylines was a solidly entertaining city builder when it released all the way back in 2015, but seven years of expansions and other post-launch DLC haved created a game of truly amazing scope. However, getting your hands on absolutely everything that&#x27;s released thus far is, inevitably, an extremely pricey undertaking even during sale season.


Hop over to the Humble Store right now though, and you can pick up publisher Paradox Interactive&#x27;s Cities: Skylines Colossal Collection. This features a total of 32 items (usually costing £204.39), including the base game, plus its After Dark, Snowfall, Natural Disasters, Mass Transit, Green Cities, Parklife, Industries, Campus, and Sunset Harbour expansions.

                              <span>As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has offered an revised breakdown of the projects currently occupying the studio&#x27;s time, confirming the &quot;bulk of&quot; its development capacity is now focused on Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s story expansion, which is still expected to launch next year.


Following Cyberpunk&#x27;s disastrous release at the tail-end of 2020, the majority of CD Projekt&#x27;s development resources (as shown in the chart below) were focused on remedying the game&#x27;s most pressing issues. At the same time, a smaller team was working on its next-gen release, promised long before the project&#x27;s launch woes, and an even smaller group was doing preliminary work on its paid expansion.


Inevitably, those numbers have shifted considerably over time - less than half of CD Projekt&#x27;s development staff were working on Cyberpunk&#x27;s base game and next-gen update by June last year, for instance - and that trend has, unsurprisingly, continued. As per today&#x27;s financial results, Cyberpunk 2077 support has &quot;shrunk considerably&quot; following the release of its next-gen update (which CD Projekt says had &quot;a positive effect on the game&#x27;s perception and sales figures&quot;), with the &quot;bulk of [the studio&#x27;s] development capacity&quot; now working on its expansion.

                              <span>Following some extended gameplay earlier this month, the developers behind Gotham Knights have given more of an insight into the designs of Nightwing&#x27;s glider and Red Hood&#x27;s (somewhat surprising) mystic leap.
During a Q&amp;A on the Gotham Knights Discord, creative director Patrick Redding revealed Nightwing&#x27;s Flying Trapeze was inspired by &quot;a couple of ideas&quot; including some classic issues in the Nightwing solo book that saw the DC hero using his &quot;aerialist moves with jet-powered gliders&quot;.
Additionally, the team wanted it to feel as though Nightwing had been through the late, great, Batman&#x27;s arsenal.

                              <span>Hidetaka Miyazaki had a boss-first approach when designing Elden Ring&#x27;s open world.


Speaking to Xbox Wire Japan (translated by IGN), Miyazaki discussed development of the game&#x27;s world and key inspirations.


&quot;Our first step when designing the map was to decide where the bosses would appear, especially the important ones,&quot; said Miyazaki. &quot;Therefore, the map was really designed on the basis of boss gameplay, then we adjusted the boss gameplay based on their location on the map.&quot;

A reddit post advertising the protest, which is supported by numerous high-profile TF2 content creators, now sits at the top of the TF2 subreddit, with more than 2000 comments and an eye-catching 1000 reddit (paid-for) awards.


The protest aims to get #SaveTF2 trending worldwide on Twitter and other social media today, 26th May, from 6pm UK time. Success, the protest&#x27;s organisers say, means showing how the aging game still retains its popularity.

The free-to-play action-adventure game has players as handlers aiming for peace between humans and dinosaurs (will they ever learn?). Players will use their combat skills to save dinosaurs from enemies and then fight alongside them. 


The trailer below shows plenty of combat, as well as a nice variety of dinosaurs to acquire. Gotta catch &#x27;em all, I suppose.

Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz as part of his book tour, Fils-Aimé argues that the games industry is &quot;woefully behind&quot; in embracing diversity. 


&quot;You don&#x27;t see it in the executive ranks, you don&#x27;t see it in the leadership ranks of key developers. It&#x27;s incredibly difficult to find it in various games,&quot; he points out.

                              <span>An Elden Ring player has managed to defeat every boss in the game in just one hit.


Twitch streamer BushyGames has released a YouTube video explaining his build and methodology - and, of course, including the boss battles themselves.


For the challenge, he gave himself free reign on strategies, abilities, and weapons, but only one attack per enemy or per boss phase (for those with multiple phases) was allowed. The (arguably overpowered) sorcery Comet Azur was also not allowed.

                              <span>Fortnite has now confirmed its next live event, dubbed Collision, will take place on Saturday 4th June at 9pm UK time. As ever, this is a one-time only affair - if you miss out, well, you&#x27;ll just have to watch a recap on YouTube.
As the culmination of this season&#x27;s all-out war, Collision will mark the return of Fortnite&#x27;s fan-favourite bear Mech, the unmasking of its pilot as the game&#x27;s final member of the Seven, and an explosive showdown with the Island&#x27;s villainous IO faction. 
If all that means nothing to you, just know that these events are typically spectacular showcases for Epic&#x27;s development flair - oh, and there will be some freebies (and paid-for bits) to commemorate the occaison in Fortnite&#x27;s item shop in the run up to and including that day.

&quot;The wait is almost over and [Supermassive Games is] so excited for you to get your hands on The Quarry,&quot; the developer tweeted, while bringing its community&#x27;s attention to the game&#x27;s release date of 10th June. &quot;However, we&#x27;ve made the difficult decision to delay the online multiplayer.&quot;
Supermassive states the reason for this delay is to ensure that it delivers &quot;the best possible experience&quot; to players on its eventual release.

Heading the line up is Far Cry 4, which sees players taking on the role of Ajay Ghale as he becomes caught up in a civil war in the fictional Kyrat. 
Meanwhile, users will also have the chance to jet off to the tropical shores of Mêlée this month, thanks to the arrival of Escape from Monkey Island. This a timely addition to the service, with the sixth game in the Monkey Island series (the appropriately-named Return to Monkey Island) due to release some time this year.

That decision, if made, would plunge a swathe of US states into a situation where legal abortion was once again largely unavailable - and it&#x27;s a situation several US-based game companies have spoken out about. 


EA, as with the majority of companies, has not. Nor has it publicly made a specific statement on legal issues threatening transgender rights, which are ongoing in several states. Now, speaking via a town hall meeting leaked to Kotaku, its chief people officer Mala Singh was asked why.

The game received an open demo in October 2020 but little has been heard since.

Returnal would follow the likes of God of War earlier this year, as well as Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn as previous console exclusives arriving on PC.

Insider (via Windows Central) reported that Microsoft&#x27;s Alex Kipman, Terry Myerson and Tom Keane have all been accused of creating a toxic workplace environment during their time with the company.
Most notably, and incredibly disturbingly, Kipman (who currently oversees Microsoft&#x27;s metaverse efforts) is reported to have watched inappropriate footage via a VR headset, which was then projected onto an external screen, while in room full of his colleagues.

                              <span>A Horizon Zero Dawn TV project is in the works for Netflix, Sony has announced. 


In a new presentation to investors, Sony also said it had a God of War TV show in development for Amazon, and a further Gran Turismo pitch it was also working on.

There&#x27;s no word on plot details for Horizon - or any of the above projects - or word on when we might see them materialise. Still, hopefully someone at Sony is talking to Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie right now and asking about her availability.

Resistance: Retribution was Bend Studio&#x27;s third-person PSP prequel to the Resistance series. As Gematsu writes, The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea have rated the game for current consoles.


PSP games will be available to Premium subscribers, though only a couple have been officially announced so far: Super Stardust Portable and Ridge Racer 2 (in Asia).

Sad Cat Studios has a team of developers based both in Belarus and Ukraine. 


&quot;The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families. As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced,&quot; the studio wrote in a tweet.

That would take its current slate of live service games to three, following the release of MLB The Show 22 and its Diamond Dynasty mode.


What&#x27;s more, by 2025 it&#x27;s projected to release a total of 12 live service franchises (six by 2023 and ten by 2024).

Additionally, it expects to make a tidy $300m on PC games alone this fiscal year (which ends March 2023).
Needless to say, these are some quite impressive figures that Sony has put out there.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s initial rollout of Sony&#x27;s new PlayStation Plus - limited, so far, to countries in Asia - has been plagued by complaints from fans who stacked subscriptions ahead of time and unexpectedly found Sony wanted them to cough up the difference when converting their membership to its new tiers.


Numerous users reported via social media that they had been told they would have to pay up for any difference in pricing - achieved via stacking or from redeeming discounted PlayStation Plus offers - for the full term of their remaining subscription balance. It was a situation that left some with eye-opening charges to suddenly cough up.


Now, following general confusion and a good deal of online backlash, Sony has finally acknowledged the situation and termed it as a &quot;technical error&quot; which &quot;has been fixed&quot;.

Speaking to investors in a briefing call, PlayStation chief Jim Ryan said, &quot;Right now, there is a considerable amount of money being spent on partnerships with independent and other third-party developers to secure a considerable pipeline of attractive VR content at the launch of PlayStation VR2,&quot; (thanks, VGC).

In a financial presentation last night, Sony exec Jim Ryan noted that, despite a strong launch, PS5 sales were lagging behind PS4 in its equivalent second year owing to supply constraints.


Those supply constraints are due to both the Covid pandemic and Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, but remain a top priority for Sony.

Oh, there are some other cars too - namely a new GT Vision Suzuki and an outrageous beefed up Camaro going under the Roadster Shop Rampage name. They come alongside some new Scapes in New Orleans to snap your cars - and once you&#x27;re done admiring the new cars you can take part in the Gran Turismo World Series which is kicking off in Gran Turismo 7 this weekend, with the preliminary rounds open to all-comers taking place on 27th May and 28th May. 


The World Series grand finale will be returning to a real life event in Monte Carlo this November - a fitting backdrop for what&#x27;s become one of the glitziest online racing competitions in recent years, and one that&#x27;s delivered some decent action too.

But by all accounts, the potential attack surface here is enormous, as many federal employees clearly will purchase these readers from a myriad of online vendors when the need arises. Saicoo’s product listings, for example, are replete with comments from customers who self-state that they work at a federal agency (and several who reported problems installing drivers).</span>

                              <span>Developer IronOak Games&#x27; wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure For The King is getting a sequel, and it&#x27;ll be making its way to PC some time next year.


The original For The King, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was a thoroughly entertaining (if sometimes brutally challenging) blend of familiar RPG stables - think dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - streamlined into a light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure.


More than anything, it was a wonderfully designed little story generator - encompassing everything from haunted carnivals to suffocating jungles - with enough potential combinations across its moving parts to feel sufficiently different each run.

                              <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator&#x27;s free Top Gun: Maverick expansion has remained something of a mystery since its announcement last June, but now, with the update finally here on Xbox and PC, developer Asobo has detailed exactly what to expect when it&#x27;s fired up for the first time.


One notable oddity of the Top Gun expansion is that it&#x27;ll be launching without what&#x27;s arguably its biggest feature: the F/A-18E Super Hornet. However, that&#x27;s only because Asobo made the decision to release the plane early as part of last year&#x27;s free Game of the Year Edition update when the expansion was delayed alongside the Top Gun: Maverick movie.


Even without the plane as its flagship addition, though, there&#x27;s still plenty for simmers to grapple with, starting with three training missions for the F/A-18E, all designed to help pilots master &quot;radical flight maneuvers including unrestricted take-offs, split S maneuvers, and low altitude, high-speed maneuvering through complex terrain.&quot;

                              <span>Northgard developer Shiro Games&#x27; sci-fi strategy title Dune: Spice Wars generated plenty of praise when it launched into Steam early access toward the end of last month, and now, as the studio starts to build on that initial success, publisher Funcom has shared an initial development roadmap promising the likes of multiplayer, spaceports, and more to come.


First up in terms of major new features is multiplayer, currently scheduled to arrive some time this &quot;summer&quot;. Details are scarce at this juncture, but Funcom&#x27;s roadmap makes reference to both co-op play and &quot;free-for-all&quot; PvP, with up to four players supported at one time.


Also due this summer is a brand-new faction, but specifics are even more limited in this case. All we&#x27;re getting for the time being is the tease of a suitably mysterious silhouette and a note that the faction will include a &quot;new victory condition&quot;.

                              <span>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 has now passed the 1m sales milestone, publisher CI Games has announced.


Released last June as the sixth game in the Sniper Ghost Warrior series, this latest entry hit the 1m sales mark in a little under 12 months. The franchise as a whole has now passed 13m sales, CI also noted.


Generally speaking, the Sniper Ghost Warrior series has recently grown in quality after some earlier stumbles - in particular the series&#x27; attempt at going open world with Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 which CI itself said had been &quot;too ambitious&quot;.

Campfire is a new social app from Pokémon Go maker Niantic which will show live Pokémon Go features, such as gyms and active raids, as well as other players who have opted to show their location. 


The app, which is set to launch this summer, will also plug into other Niantic games such as Ingress.

                              <span>Barely a month has gone by since the arrival of No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s major Outlaws update, which gave intergalactic explorers the opportunity to live out their pirate fantasies, but already Hello Games is back - this time with a brand-new expedition that finally answers fan pleas to add space whales (of a sort) to the exploratory sim.
Expeditions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, are effectively No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle its various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And today&#x27;s addition, titled Leviathan, is a very different proposition to April&#x27;s The Blighted, and sounds considerably more ambitious - and significantly weirder - than any of the expeditions we&#x27;ve seen before. 
That said, Leviathan begins in much the same way as previous expeditions, dropping all players into one location. However, what follows is something closer to a roguelike experience, stripping explorers of their progress whenever they die. The narrative twist, though, is that players are actually stuck in a mysterious time loop, and the entire community will need to work together to find a way to break free.

Its release on Android and iOS is marked by this brand-new trailer. It&#x27;s laced with nostalgia, with the perfect synthwave backing track to get your blood pumping. You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>Dream Daddy developer Game Grumps has a new psychological horror game in the works called Homebody.


Inspired by classic slasher films of the 1980s, it&#x27;s a narrative-driven game that sees you escaping a house by solving puzzles, making dialogue decisions, and avoiding the killer.


That&#x27;s an impossible feat at first, but repeated attempts at escape will put all the pieces together. And judging by the trailer below, its low-fi graphics only add to the horrifying atmosphere.

                              <span>Following the news of Starfield&#x27;s delay into 2023, a team of creators have shared their vision for the game in Unreal Engine 5.
&quot;We&#x27;re so excited for Starfield we couldn&#x27;t help but imagine this upcoming game in Unreal,&quot; the team shared on their YouTube channel (Enfant Terrible).
The footage may only be short, but it is absolutely gorgeous and packed with swelling music and sprawling, otherworldly, vistas. Enfant Terrible created this trailer (of sorts) by using &quot;footage from different Unreal Engine 5 reels and projects&quot; to imagine how Bethesda&#x27;s &quot;Space Opera&quot; could look on its release.

                              <span>Twitch could soon be changing its policy on offering specific reasons when a streamer is banned.


Currently, if a streamer is suspended or banned, they receive a notification that explains which rule has been broken but without further detail.


That leaves some streamers unaware of what behaviour broke the rules, or they can feign ignorance.

EG7 went on to reveal it had originally planned to invest more than SEK 500m (£40m) in this project over the coming few years.

                              <span>A new staff group within Activision Blizzard has been formed to fight for worker rights. 


The Worker Committee Against Sex and Gender Discrimination has been founded by 12 current and former staff members, including high-profile ABetterABK member Jessica Gonzalez, and has presented a list of demands to embattled boss Bobby Kotick, The Washington Post reported.


Issues raised include improvements to private breastfeeding areas, an end to undocumented meetings with HR, improved support for transgender employees, two weeks extra paid time off for parental leave (up to 12 weeks), and the need for independent investigations into allegations of discrimination.

However, users in Asia have spotted artwork of the lead character from Dino Crisis used as the cover for classic games, suggesting it could be added soon.

This includes a closer look at some of the game trials that are available through the service. However, this feature is not going to take a one size (or length) fits all approach. 
As noticed by PSVortex, games such as Horizon: Forbidden West and Cyberpunk 2077 will have trials lasting five hours, which seems a fairly generous offering.
Meanwhile, other titles such as the recently released Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and WWE 2K22, only offer trials for two hours.

                              <span>The Witcher School live-action role-play events in Poland, one of which I attended in 2016, have come to an end because of a contractual termination by CD Projekt Red over use of The Witcher name. The exact reasons why are potentially political but also unclear.
5 Żywiołów (5 Elements), the company behind the events, alleges that CD Projekt Red pulled the licence because of a staff member&#x27;s involvement with the ultra-conservative Polish Catholic organisation Ordo Iuris, which is anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+, and rejects the idea of gender equality.
The staff member in question, Ania Wawrzyniak, is the wife of 5 Żywiołów founder Dastin Wawrzyniak. And according to a Facebook post co-signed by brothers Dastin and Dominic Wawrzyniak, Ania worked as a lawyer for the company for around two years (between 2017 and 2019, they later specified).

                              <span>Yet another adversarial ML attack:
Most deep neural networks are trained by stochastic gradient descent. Now “stochastic” is a fancy Greek word for “random”; it means that the training data are fed into the model in random order.
So what happens if the bad guys can cause the order to be not random? You guessed it—all bets are off. Suppose for example a company or a country wanted to have a credit-scoring system that’s secretly sexist, but still be able to pretend that its training was actually fair. Well, they could assemble a set of financial data that was representative of the whole population, but start the model’s training on ten rich men and ten poor women drawn from that set ­ then let initialisation bias do the rest of the work...</span>

The Structured Logging Working
Group
has added new capabilities to the logging infrastructure in Kubernetes
1.24. This blog post explains how developers can take advantage of those to
make log output more useful and how they can get involved with improving Kubernetes.
Structured logging
The goal of structured
logging
is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log
entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters
separately, for example as a JSON struct.
When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls,
strings were originally printed with \n escape sequences, except when
embedded inside a struct. For structs, log entries could still span multiple
lines, with no clean way to spl…</span>

                              <span>Temtem, developer Crema&#x27;s massively multiplayer riff on Pokémon, will be leaving early access and getting its full PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 6th September.


Temtem, you might recall, entered Steam early access back in January 2020, selling over half a million copies in its first month of release. Crema has been steadily expanded the game&#x27;s core creature-collecting and battling action since then - introducing the likes of new Temtem, new islands to explore, and new social and competitive features, not to mention launching an early access version for PS5 - and update 1.0 is now finally in sight.


After more than two years in early access, Temtem is already pretty feature rich, with its pre-release version including the bulk of its story campaign across the Airborne Archipelago, well over 100 Temtem to catch, co-op play, competitive multiplayer, clans, housing, trading, and tournaments. However, its final release promises a number of new additions.

                              <span>The Sims 4&#x27;s long-awaited customisable pronouns feature has finally arrived - albeit in English only to begin with - and is available now as part of the game&#x27;s latest update.


Developer Maxis confirmed it was investigating ways to introduce expanded pronoun options to The Sims 4 last May - following a community petition signed by more than 22,000 people - and players got a first look at the feature&#x27;s progress during a livestream earlier this year.


And now, with some additional development time under its belt, Maxis has pushed the first iteration of its customisable pronouns feature - developed in conjunction with LGBTQ+ nonprofit organisations It Gets Better and GLAAD - live, delivering what it calls a further step &quot;in the direction of a more inclusive experience for Simmers&quot;.

Platforms have yet to be detailed.


Activision Blizzard formally revealed Modern Warfare 2 and its logo in April - after months of rumours and even an official pre-announcement announcement in February.


Following today&#x27;s release date confirmation, specifics remain extremely light, but the gameplay-free trailer accompanying Activision Blizzard&#x27;s announcement does include a description revealing a smidgeon more of what&#x27;s in store.

                              <span>Battlefield is as famous for its troubled launches as it is its sandbox multiplayer, but even by its own standards 2042 has been something of a disaster - lumpy, incomplete and with some less than popular decisions along the way such as the expansive maps designed to accommodate the newly expanded 128 player count and the introduction of specialists. 


DICE at least does have some previous in turning around a shaky ship - Battlefield 4 went from a disastrous launch to become one of the most celebrated in the series - and is making the right noises ahead of the belated launch of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s first season next month. 


While we&#x27;re not yet privy to the full reveal, a discussion between creative director Lars Gustavsson, senior producer Ryan McArthur and community manager Freeman outlined the studio&#x27;s commitment to Battlefield 2042 - interesting itself in light of comments made by EA boss Andrew Wilson to investors earlier this month that suggested development on the series is being rethought - as well as what changes to expect.

Constructing the new armory hut will let you show off up to five loadouts and easily swap between them via the game&#x27;s main menu, so you can build gear for specific situations and shuffle amongst them on the fly. 


It&#x27;s a handy feature which was also added post-launch to Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey, Valhalla&#x27;s predecessor, and no doubt will also encourage a few people to go splash out further on some of this game&#x27;s flashier cosmetic armour sets. Here&#x27;s how it looks:

                              <span>The latest patch for Final Fantasy 14 has removed the automatic log out function when players are inactive for 30 minutes.


The function was included last year to ease congestion in the ever-popular MMORPG, as players complained about long queue times due to overloaded servers.



However, its removal in this latest patch suggests that congestion is finally easing.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild may be well over five years old now, but its community is still uncovering charming little details that have been tucked away by Nintendo. One such find has recently surfaced, and it involves the final memory Link uncovers towards the game&#x27;s close.
Those who have played through Breath of the Wild will know that Link slowly starts to regain his memories of the events before and during the Great Calamity as the game progresses (of course, this being Breath of the Wild, you could also blast through without collecting a single one of these memories if facing off against Ganon with the bare essentials is more your thing). 
The final memory can only be discovered when players have collected the 12 others scattered across Hyrule and cannot be happened upon by accident (which incidentally is how I found most of them - my geographical recognition was pretty poor during my first playthrough).

                              <span>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is seeing a surge in players, reportedly down to a meme.


The Metal Gear Solid spin-off from Platinum Games was first released in 2013 on PS3 and Xbox 360 (with a PC release in 2014), but has recently seen a rise of 1000 percent in its average concurrent Steam players.


That&#x27;s been put down by some to the recent popularity of the Jetstream Sam meme, spotted by IGN.

A Nintendo Switch launch will follow later this year, although there&#x27;s no exact date for this as yet.


&quot;The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, based on the legendary The Lord of the Rings trilogy of books by JRR Tolkien, tells of Gollum&#x27;s experiences from behind-the-scenes in the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; writes  Daedalic. &quot;After losing his precious ring to Bilbo Baggins, Gollum decides to leave the Misty Mountains and embark on a perilous journey that leads him from the dungeons of Barad-dûr to the realm of the Wood-elves in Mirkwood.   

&quot;In order to survive the dangers of his journey through Middle-earth, Gollum has to sneak and climb and use all his cunning.&quot;  As part of a hands-off preview last week, I got to see some of this cunning in action.

The below teaser shows Nihilego, a Rock/Poison-type which looks like a big space jellyfish. It&#x27;s actually one of the more normal-looking Ultra Beasts, which were specifically designed to appear alien in the traditional Pokémon world.


We also get a glimpse of a figure dressed in the uniform of the Ultra Recon Squad. Will these be new PVE enemies in the game&#x27;s overworld? Or is this just a snazzy outfit for your avatar to wear? Here&#x27;s a look:

Clone Carnage will seemingly support up to four-player multiplayer, or a local two-player multiplayer option with split screen gameplay. Additionally, it will support cross-gen play (at least on Xbox consoles) and have 4K Ultra HD.

Take-Two is the company behind some of video gaming&#x27;s biggest names, such as Borderlands and Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, BioShock and Mafia.

                              <span>A new report has detailed plans by TikTok to enter the video games market. 


The hugely-popular social app is conducting tests with in-app games in Vietnam, Reuters has said. 


In response, Tiktok confirmed the gaming push, and said it was currently looking at bringing HTML5 games to its app from third-party pubishers such as Zynga.

                              <span>The second season of Babylon&#x27;s Fall content - due next week - will now run for much longer, putting the future of the game into question.


Publisher Square Enix had originally planned each season to last three months, but now that&#x27;s been doubled. &quot;Based on the feedback we have received from our players, we feel that we need a period to re-evaluate the game&#x27;s future operating roadmap&quot;, according to a blog post from last Friday.


&quot;Season 2 will include the Ver. 1.2.1 small-scale update, but after that we will be using the extra three months of the season extension for development on the next update, and so will not be making any further updates or adding new content during that time.

                              <span>Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman worked on both The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge all the way back in the early 90&#x27;s. Now, the duo are returning to the series in the aptly named Return to Monkey Island and in the run up to its release have revealed the one puzzle they regret from their original time working on the series. 
Chatting to GamesBeat, Gilbert and Grossman revealed the Monkey Wrench puzzle from LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge, which saw Guybrush Threepwood using an actual monkey to activate a seemingly broken pump, was a mistake, calling it &quot;notoriously unsolvable&quot; and &quot;not a good design on several levels&quot;. 
&quot;Even if you are an English speaker from a location where the tool in question is commonly called a &#x27;monkey wrench,&#x27; and you realise that that&#x27;s what you need, you still have to make an astonishing predictive leap about how your actions will create that tool,&quot; said Grossman. &quot;Nothing in the game sets any of it up adequately.&quot;

                              <span>It seems plenty of people are thirsting after Elden Ring&#x27;s sexy wolfman Blaidd. So much so, Buzzfeed has done a thirst tweet reaction video with voice actor Scott Arthur.


Blaidd, for the unaware, is an NPC in FromSoftware&#x27;s epic who&#x27;s half man and half wolf. He&#x27;s involved in one of the game&#x27;s main quests, helps players with one of the major bosses, and has had the furry community in a frenzy.


Welsh voice actor Arthur admits it too. &quot;I know that he&#x27;s caused quite a stir in the furry world, which I didn&#x27;t know anything about until I looked on the internet,&quot; he says at the start.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s revamped PlayStation Plus subscription has now begun rolling out worldwide, and is available first in Asia from today. 


The launch gives us our first proper look at the service&#x27;s full catalogue of games - although fans say it contains far fewer titles in its catalogue than previously expected. 


Indeed, a guide to PlayStation Plus published yesterday on the PlayStation blog mentions &quot;700&quot; games available across the subscription&#x27;s various plans - a rough figure we&#x27;ve heard from Sony before - albeit with the caveat that these games will vary &quot;over time and plan&quot;.

                              <span>It appears that Sony is using the PAL version of PS1 classics in its PS Plus subscription.


The subscription has now launched in Asia, but - as spotted by VGC - some PS1 games are using the PAL (Europe, Australia, New Zealand) version instead of the NTSC (Asia, America).


That means they&#x27;re presented in 50Hz instead of 60Hz, resulting in a lower refresh rate and therefore lower framerates.

Lost Sands will the fourth monthly instalment in Seas of Thieves&#x27; ongoing, seasons-spanning narrative, and is aiming to significantly raise the stakes by giving players the option to side with an in-game faction and make a permanent mark on the world.


Golden Sands has, of course, been at the very centre of Sea of Thieves&#x27; current story arc, beginning in January when the beautiful tropical island outpost became shrouded in a mysterious green fog and, amid signs of a desperate battle, saw all its inhabitants disappear.

                              <span>A group of 28 QA testers at Activision Blizzard&#x27;s Wisconsin-based Raven Software studio have, despite the publisher&#x27;s ongoing anti-unionisation efforts, won their vote to unionise.


Quality Assurance testers at Raven Software formally announced their intent to unionise under the name Game Workers Alliance in January - amid then-ongoing strike action following the firing of 12 members of the developer&#x27;s QA team - but when Activision Blizzard missed a deadline to voluntarily recognise the union, the group filed a petition with independent government agency the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to initiate a union election.


Activision Blizzard contested the filing, but its arguments were rejected by NLRB, whereupon the publisher was reportedly began ramping up its anti-unionisation efforts.

                              <span>As Sony&#x27;s revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service goes live across Asian markets, more and more previously unknown details are beginning to emerge, including the news that Syphon Filter won&#x27;t be the only classic PS1 title getting trophy support at launch.


When Sony Bend Studio shared word of Syphon Filter&#x27;s new trophies last week, it didn&#x27;t confirm whether other PS1 titles would be getting a similar treatment as part of Sony&#x27;s revised PlayStation Plus - but with the service now going live, that question has been answered.


Achievement tracking website Exophase has revealed trophy lists for four more PS1 games alongside the previously announced Syphon Filter: I.Q. Intelligent Qube, Hot Shots Golf, Ape Escape, and Wild Arms (which, notably, wasn&#x27;t on Sony&#x27;s previous list of PS Plus inclusions).

                              <span>Former PlayStation employee Emma Majo has launched a new gender discrimination lawsuit against PlayStation after an initial attempt was dismissed by a federal judge in April.


Majo, an ex-PlayStation IT analyst, initially filed a suit against the company last November, claiming, among other things, that PlayStation paid women less than men in similar jobs, that women were denied promotions, and that she was wrongfully fired &quot;soon after&quot; submitting a signed statement to Sony in 2021 detailing the alleged gender bias she had experienced.


Those initial claims were supported by a raft of new allegations in March, when eight more PlayStation employees, past and present, submitted statements alleging sexual harassment, bullying, gender bias, and an inability to properly investigate these issues at the company.

Speaking to TrueAchievements, former Eidos Montréal art director Jonathan Jacque-Belletête stated that before it went back over to be worked on in Japan, his team had a &quot;really cool&quot; Final Fantasy game in the works.
&quot;[Eidos Montréal] brought back Deus Ex. I was the art director on that - Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Then [I was] the executive art director on Mankind Divided. Then we tried to do Final Fantasy 15,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Horizon Forbidden West is back at the top of the UK physical charts three months after its release.


Sales of the game rose 94 percent week-on-week, largely thanks to a new PS5 bundle that includes the game with the console.


Fresh console stock also means other PS5 games have leapt into the charts: Gran Turismo 7 is back up to tenth place with a 38 percent sales rise, while Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart re-enters at 15 with a 275 percent sales rise (thanks GamesIndustry.biz).

An announcement on the Japanese Pac-Man website says that the collaboration between  Fortnite and Pac-Man will start from 2nd June.
From then, players will be able to purchase items with a &#x27;Pac-Man&#x27; motif. So, perhaps we won&#x27;t be seeing entire Pac-Man skins gobbling their way through Fortnite&#x27;s map next month, but time will tell.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s revamped PS Plus subscription service launches in Asia this week and new details are already emerging.


It&#x27;s been revealed that various visual options for PS1 games will be available, including multiple resolutions (native, 4:3 for 16:9, and stretched) as well as three filters: default, retro classic, and modern. 


Retro classic is essentially a CRT filter, meaning it&#x27;s replicating the visuals of old TVs for that vintage feel.

This file is encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption combined with Base64 encoding.
A 4-digit application PIN (which gets set during the initial onboarding when a user first instals the application) is the encryption password used to protect or encrypt the licence data.
The problem here is that an attacker who has access to the encrypted licence data (whether that be through accessing a phone backup, direct access to the device or remote compromise) could easily brute-force this 4-digit PIN by using a script that would try all 10,000 combinations…...</span>

In Kubernetes, Services are an abstract way to expose
an application running on a set of Pods. Services
can have a cluster-scoped virtual IP address (using a Service of type: ClusterIP).
Clients can connect using that virtual IP address, and Kubernetes then load-balances traffic to that
Service across the different backing Pods.
How Service ClusterIPs are allocated?
A Service ClusterIP can be assigned:
dynamically
the cluster&#x27;s control plane automatically picks a free IP address from within the configured IP range for type: ClusterIP Services.
statically
you specify an IP address of your choice, from within the configured IP range for Services.

Across your whole cluster, every Service ClusterIP must be unique.

                              <span>Asmodee Digital&#x27;s video game adaptation of acclaimed co-op board game Gloomhaven is, after more than two years on Steam, finally coming to consoles.

Although Flaming Fowl Studios developed the PC version - which came out of early access at the end of last year - Saber Interactive will seemingly be handling the console port. 

&quot;We&#x27;re excited to bring Gloomhaven to new players around the world with Saber Interactive,&quot; Asmodee Digital CEO Pierre Ortolan confirmed to press. &quot;Partnerships like this are one of the great advantages we have available to us now as part of Embracer Group, and we look forward to tapping into even more opportunities to deliver for our fans in the future.&quot;

                              <span>A surprise ESRB listing for Square Enix&#x27;s newly announced The DioField Chronicle has revealed some additional details about the mysterious game. 

The DioField Chronicle is a new tactics game coming to PS4 and PS5 later this year, as well as PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It was announced at PlayStation State of Play back in March.

Beyond that, we haven&#x27;t really heard all that much about it, so it was a pleasant surprise to see the tactics game pop up on the ESRB website (thanks, Gematsu), not least because it included a summary of the game, as well as details as to why the board classified it as a &quot;Teen&quot; game due to its blood, &quot;mild suggestive themes&quot;, and violence. There&#x27;s also confirmation that at some point, a villain kidnaps women and &quot;forces them to work in a brothel&quot;.

                              <span>Ukraine-based studio GSC Game World has reportedly confirmed that development on Stalker 2 &quot;continues&quot;.

Development of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl was paused back in March as the company is based in Kyiv, Ukraine&#x27;s capital, which has been repeatedly targeted during the ongoing Russian invasion. It&#x27;s since relocated to Prague whilst the war persists.

As spotted by polish site GRYonline.pl, (via VGC) however, the studio is now back at work, having confirming to fans on its Discord community that &quot;it continues&quot; development.

According to u/Sagezu on Reddit, the bug - which is thought to have been introduced in the MMO&#x27;s most recent update - sees your item UI get stuck to the mouse pointer, essentially prohibiting you from doing anything else.

In a thread entitled &quot;GAME BREAKING VALTAN BUG ruined the whole raid by not being able to click !!!&quot; the Lost Ark player even added a video to exemplify the issue:

In an interview with NetEase Games (via Niche Gamer), Suda hinted that the team is making &quot;truly cool and all-new games&quot; that may be announced &quot;around the end of the year&quot;.

The Tokyo-based studio was bought by NetEase Games for an undisclosed fee towards the end of last year, and recently gave an interview to its new parent company. As an aging Japanese GCSE and Duolingo lessons only get me so far, thankfully the interview includes English subtitles - you can check it out below:

“In recent years, as media companies have taken greater interest in the rapidly growing gaming industry, [CEO Andrew Wilson] and Electronic Arts have held talks with a number of different potential suitors, including Disney, Apple and Amazon, sources with knowledge of those talks told me,” Puck reporter, Dylan Byers, wrote.

Without explicitly commenting on the revelation, Kojima shared a handful of pictures of the pair - the location of which seemingly celebrates Reedus&#x27; The Walking Dead show - with the text &quot;go to your private room, friend&quot;.

For those not in the know, the private room is a space where lead character Sam Bridges - played by Reedus - recovers during his journey in Death Stranding.

Up until now, the feature - which lets you play the sci-fi sim on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers - was initially restricted to the premium tier Omega players only. Now, Alpha players can access it too, albeit for 30 PLEX £1.20/$1.50 per 24-hour subscription. You&#x27;ll also need a stable internet connection of at least 25mbps, too. 

&quot;Starting today Alpha pilots can now take advantage of Eve Anywhere, the revolutionary cloud-based platform that puts New Eden directly in your browser of choice!&quot; developer CCP Games explains explains (via VentureBeat).

                              <span>Players have discovered a &quot;game-breaking&quot; bug in Kirby 64.

Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards is the latest N64 game to have been released on the Nintendo Online Expansion Pass. Originally released in 2000, it&#x27;s a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer featuring Kirby&#x27;s copy abilities, which can be combined into Power Combos, and it joined the Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s library of classic games just yesterday.

However, according to Redditor Keyblademasternadroj, there&#x27;s a bug in underwater levels that &quot;causes you to enter hit stun forever&quot; that can only be rectified by quitting the game.

                              <span>PUBG&#x27;s 17.2 update is now available on PC and mobile, bringing the 1v1 Arena to Training Mode, as well as updates to the Spotter Scope and balance changes to 5.56 Designated Marksman Rifles (DMR) and the Mortar.

&quot;The Spotter Scope and its automatic features of marking and following enemies continued to show overly strong performance, causing more stress than enjoyable experiences to our players,&quot; Krafton explains. &quot;Therefore, the enemy detection range has been reduced from 1000m to 600m and the white passive marker will not appear automatically in ADS mode.&quot;

As for the 1v1 Arena mode? That&#x27;s now available in Training Mode and welcomes &quot;all types of combat practice in a suspenseful 1v1 setting&quot;, as well as curious spectators, too.

                              <span>Locks that use Bluetooth Low Energy to authenticate keys are vulnerable to remote unlocking. The research focused on Teslas, but the exploit is generalizable.
In a video shared with Reuters, NCC Group researcher Sultan Qasim Khan was able to open and then drive a Tesla using a small relay device attached to a laptop which bridged a large gap between the Tesla and the Tesla owner’s phone.
“This proves that any product relying on a trusted BLE connection is vulnerable to attacks even from the other side of the world,” the UK-based firm said in a statement, referring to the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol—technology used in millions of cars and smart locks which automatically open when in close proximity to an authorised device...</span>

Stellaris, a sort of space-faring amalgam of grand strategy and 4X action, burst onto the scene back in 2016 to significant acclaim. Six years on, it&#x27;s a substantially different beast, with Paradox having made some sweeping changes along the way, most notably in its radical 2.0 release.
The many faceted road to galactic supremacy it present is still a tonne of strategic fun though, even if - as is generally the way with Paradox titles - the purity of the base game has now been somewhat muddied by an increasingly unwieldy stack of post-launch DLC.

                              <span>If you were roaring at the starting line ready to race into Redout 2 later this month, you might want to cool your engines (sorry, I&#x27;ll stop this now); developer 34BigThings has announced a short delay for its stylish anti-grav racing sequel, with the game now set to release on 16th June.


Redout 2, which was originally expected to launch on 26th May, builds on the superb racing action of its 2016 predecessor with a whole new set of tracks (36 in total, plus mirror variants of each) alongside expanded customisation options - with players now able to start with one of 12 distinct chassis and strap on the likes of new rocket engines, propulsors, stabilsers, rudders, magnets, intercoolers, flaps, wings, and spoilers.


There&#x27;s also online multiplayer racing for up to 12 challengers, plus a single-player career campaign, promising &quot;hundreds&quot; of events from a variety of different modes, including Arena Races, Time Attacks, Last Man Standing, and Boss Races.

                              <span>After one hell of a long wait, the live-action Halo TV adaptation finally arrived earlier this year, and the response has been...mixed. And now Marcus Lehto, co-creator of the videogame series that started all, has shared his own thoughts on the adaptation, saying that while he doesn&#x27;t &quot;hate&quot; it, he was ultimately &quot;confused by many of the choices that were made&quot;.


Paramount+&#x27;s Halo adaptation finally launched for US audiences this March - a mere nine years after it was originally announced - and while changes were expected (fans were forewarned that the TV show takes place in the so-called Silver Timeline, separate from the core Halo canon), the end result has certainly proven divisive.


While it was Master Chief&#x27;s amusing loss of inhibitions that drew the most headlines over the series&#x27; run - just episodes after he&#x27;d stunned audiences by showing his face for the first time, he&#x27;d got his bum out, then ended the series having sex in front of his mum - there&#x27;s been plenty of criticism around the show&#x27;s writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing.

                              <span>Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers is a brand new film out today on Disney+. For some reason, it features Ugly Sonic.


Ugly Sonic, as you&#x27;ll no doubt be aware, was the original design for Sonic in the 2020 film before fans complained. His dodgy teeth and human eyes were removed, eventually leading to a decent film and better sequel.




But now he&#x27;s back and... uglier than ever before. Honestly, it&#x27;s terrifying.

Just added for Global Accessibility Awareness Day are new badges for viewers to identify as audio or video only, so streamers can see those with a limited channel experience.


Earlier this year the platform began working with accessibility consultants to review the Creator Stream Manager dashboard on web, mobile apps, and the core UI library to improve accessibility across the board.

When this update goes live, players will be able to continue on with their adventures in The Chasm. But they will not be alone there, as they will join a new team of &quot;diverse members&quot; to &quot;discover a long-sealed history about the people, monsters and the yakshas&quot;.
In addition a to new story quest and challenges, two new playable characters will also be introduced to the game. Their names are Yelan and Kuki Shinobu and HoYoverse has assured us they will be &quot;capable allies&quot;. Yelan is described as a &quot;mysterious figure with many faces and identities&quot; and will use a bow as her weapon of choice. Meanwhile, Kuki is a &quot;surprisingly reliable and capable deputy leader of the Arataki Gang&quot; who uses a sword and can manipulate the Electro element. You can check out the new trailer for Version 2.7 below.

It seemed to be the bargain of the year, if not century, for the holding company. 
Now, in its financial report, Embracer has highlighted its hopes for the future following this acquisition (including potential remakes of some classic titles) saying, &quot;after the end of the quarter, we further strengthened our development capabilities and IP-portfolio by entering into an agreement to acquire Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal, including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain and other IPs.
&quot;We see a great potential, not only in sequels, but also in remakes, remasters, spinoffs, as well as transmedia projects across the Group.&quot;

The Xbox Play team has daily streams on the main Xbox Twitch channel. Since April, the team has partnered with Sorenson (a communications company with the largest global interpreter base) to launch a dedicated ASL channel with around 25 hours of streams a week.


This follows the inclusion of sign language support in Forza Horizon 5 - both American and British.

The heavily-delayed mobile version of the embattled eFootball 2022 arrives eight months after eFootball 2022 first launched and was widely panned.


Also on 2nd June, the 1.1.0 update for eFootball 2022 on PC and console comes out - the first update since season one launched in April. &quot;Too little, too late,&quot; was Eurogamer&#x27;s verdict.

Kubernetes v1.24 introduces alpha support for Non-Graceful Node Shutdown. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shutdown or in a non-recoverable state such as hardware failure or broken OS.
How is this different from Graceful Node Shutdown
You might have heard about the Graceful Node Shutdown capability of Kubernetes,
and are wondering how the Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature is different from that. Graceful Node Shutdown
allows Kubernetes to detect when a node is shutting down cleanly, and handles that situation appropriately.
A Node Shutdown can be &quot;graceful&quot; only if the node shutdown action can be detected by the kubelet ahead

Mysteries were originally discussed back in January, when Rare laid out its plans for Sea of Thieves in 2022. The big gambit this year, if you&#x27;re unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.


It&#x27;s a promising idea that so far doesn&#x27;t really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves&#x27; initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation. But with three Adventures now under its belt, Rare is ready to launch the other major component of 2022&#x27;s ambitious narrative plans: Mysteries.

                              <span>EA has announced two new small-scale Kit expansions for The Sims 4 - one themed around evening fashion, the other around camping for kids - with both due to release on 26th May. Astute readers may note the word werewolf is yet to feature, despite previous teases from EA, but there&#x27;s still some hope it seems...


The first of EA&#x27;s newly announced expansions is the Moonlight Chic Kit, which appears to primarily focus its attention on new clothing options for your little digital pals, offering up new looks, designed by Parisian creator Paola Locatelli, said to be &quot;perfect for all the experiences a Sim will encounter during a night out on the town&quot;.


Expect &quot;slinky dresses, flowing shirts and smart jackets, all of which can be styled with sneakers for casual fun or dressed up with some silk and sparkles for a romantic date.&quot;

                              <span>Ben Brode, the charismatic former boss of Blizzard&#x27;s card battler Hearthstone, has finally revealed his new project. It&#x27;s called Marvel Snap, and is a new multiplayer collectible card game filled with comic book characters.

Brode quit Blizzard back in 2018, after more than 15 years at the company, and before its more recent troubles became public. Alongside others who had worked with him to launch Hearthstone, Brode went on to found his own studio, Second Dinner, which has been working on Marvel Snap ever since with Chinese outfit Nuverse, the gaming arm of TikTok owner Bytedance.


Snap&#x27;s focus is on short, unique matches which &quot;cut out the fluff&quot; and last around three minutes total. Player decks are smaller - 15 cards or fewer - and both players act simultaneously, rather than waiting for the other person to finish.

                              <span>System of a Down singer Serj Tankian has joined the growing selection of artists contributing to upcoming music-themed first-person shooter Metal: Hellsinger.


Metal: Hellsinger, which was revealed back in June 2020, is the work of developer The Outsiders - the studio co-founded by former Battlefield 3 lead designer and Payday 2 director David Goldfarb - and promises to developer plenty of furious gun-based demon-slaying, all synced up to a metal soundtrack.


Each of the game&#x27;s stages will feature its own track, with the player&#x27;s power increasing - alongside the complexity of the music, from atmospheric background ambience all the way up to big metal anthems - if they manage to keep their attacks timed to the beat.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we&#x27;re talking PlayStation Plus Premium, and our thoughts on whether it&#x27;s worth the price based on what we know so far. 

The thing is, there are still several questions about what it will provide - even now, less than a week away from its initial rollout in Asia. What is its full game list? How good will its streaming be? And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet &amp; Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? 
The biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield&#x27;s delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

&quot;Aspyr has gone full in to make this the best game that they can make. When we acquired Aspyr, we knew from the start that they would require our assistance [and] Saber has tremendous expertise in creating these types of products,&quot; he said.

The update has not yet been officially announced by Ubisoft, but details of its impending arrival on PlayStation 5 were scooped up by PlayStationSize, a Twitter account which regularly crawls behind the scenes of the PlayStation Store.


Patch notes for the update include an option to enable a &quot;higher framerate&quot; on PS5, and a &quot;franchise menu&quot;. The update is expected to launch next week.

Arizona man Nathan Harris is trying to launch the suit, which claims Hearthstone tricks players into non-refundable purchases without knowing the odds of rare cards (thanks, Polygon). 


In particular, Harris complains that his daughter - who used his credit card without asking - did not realise you could not get a refund from packs which &quot;almost never received any valuable cards&quot;. The game also lacks parental controls, Harris complained.

The announcement was made as part of the seventh anniversary celebrations for the game&#x27;s release on last-gen consoles and PC.


This is welcome news for Witcher fans, who last month got the bad news that the upgrade was delayed indefinitely after  its development was moved in-house from Saber Interactive.

That&#x27;s shortly after Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda showcase which starts at 6pm UK time.

                              <span>Max Hoberman, CEO of Halo co-developer Certain Affinity, has shared a message with staff regarding recent political events, namely those involving personal health and privacy matters and the recent draft from the US Supreme Court to potentially overturn Roe vs. Wade.
&quot;As a business leader it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to navigate highly politicised issues like transgender and abortion rights. But I&#x27;m not content to sit back and say or do nothing,&quot; he tweeted, before sharing an in-depth message he had sent out to his employees.
This message reads: &quot;It is appalling that states, including the [Certain Affinity] headquarters&#x27; home state of Texas, are wading into what I consider personal health and privacy matters. Recently this encompassed gross intrusions on the rights and dignity of transgender youth, putting politics over the physical and emotional health and wellbeing of a vulnerable population, and threatening their families, friends, doctors and other supporters.

                              <span>Square Enix is continuing to support Babylon&#x27;s Fall with a second season of content, despite the fact barely anyone is playing it.



Game directors Kenji Saito and Takahisa Sugiyama were interviewed and discussed difficulties with developing a live service game.



&quot;It is our first time developing and amending content after release as part of a live service, so we need to prioritise player feedback above all else. In that sense, it really brings home the realisation that this game is very much a service as well as a standalone product,&quot; said Saito.

  Fortunately (or to the chagrin of Activision), there have since been numerous leaks revealing what&#x27;s ahead for  the first-person shooter series. 


First, there&#x27;s a brand-new game mode called DMZ, an extraction-style mode similar to Escape From Tarkov.

Staff affected currently support live operations on FIFA 22, Kotaku reported, among other games. 


EA has confirmed the layoffs and said the job losses would ultimately &quot;reduce complexity and increase our efficiency, flexibility and scalability&quot;.

It follows on from the likes of Spider Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and The Last of Us Part Two in having an extensive suite of options.


&quot;Not only have we redesigned our UI to allow for more flexibility and readability, but we have also rebuilt controller remapping from the ground up and added more customization to our combat and interaction systems. We have retained all our accessibility features from 2018&#x27;s God of War and expanded upon them to include more than 60 ways to adjust gameplay to best suit your style and needs,&quot; reads a PlayStation Blog on the topic.

                              <span>You can now watch the first episode of the Pokémon: Hisuian Snow anime series on YouTube or through Pokémon TV.
The show&#x27;s debut episode, which is called &quot;Onto the Icy Blue&quot;, introduces us to a boy named Alec. During his youth, Alec was led to believe that Pokémon and people could not live peacefully together. This is due to the Pokémon&#x27;s powers, which the humans fear. However, when an older and wiser Alec goes to visit his father the Hisui region (of Arceus fame), he starts to look back on his childhood and recalls an encounter with a wild and (characteristically) timid Zorua. 
It is a short but adorable watch, and perfect to enjoy with a nice cup of tea. So, that&#x27;s your cue. Pop the kettle on, then come back and settle on in with the first episode, which can be watched below.

                              <span>Today brings a look at gameplay for Fallout: London, the upcoming Fallout 4 PC mod that lets you explore the UK&#x27;s post-apocalyptic capital.


It&#x27;s planned to be about the size of the base game&#x27;s Commonwealth map, making this a hugely ambitious piece of DLC.


&quot;The mod encapsulates the gritty, adventurous nature of the Fallout games with a new world, factions, storylines, NPCs, weapons, creatures, and much more! This all comes together in a package tied with a uniquely British bow,&quot; reads the press release.

                              <span>A new mod for God of War shows off something I never imagined - but now I&#x27;ve seen it, I can&#x27;t take my eyes off it: Homer and Bart Simpson stepping into the shoes of Kratos and Atreus. 
Oh, and you know The Stranger (wink wink) we all meet at the beginning of the game - well, thanks to this mod, he becomes the Hi-diddly-hoing Ned Flanders.
The mod comes from Omega Fantasy (via IGN) and uses the character models from 2003&#x27;s The Simpson&#x27;s Hit and Run. And to be honest, if all this mod did was swap out God of War&#x27;s characters for those from Hit and Run, it would have still been an incredibly amusing watch.

But now, players have also found a questionable method of farming XP - in King Kong&#x27;s private parts. 


A clip posted on the Warzone subreddit shows a player flying a helicopter toward&#x27;s King Kong&#x27;s giant testicles (which is easier said than done as Kong tends to crush anyone that heads towards him).

                              <span>Bungie has responded to the recent terrorist attack in Buffalo that resulted in the deaths of ten people and the injury of three others by announcing a new charity initiative and pledging to bolster its ongoing efforts &quot;to maintain safe and anti-racist spaces&quot; within its community.


&quot;On Saturday, 14th May, a young white man drove hours from his home to a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, and opened fire in a crowded supermarket, killing ten people and maiming three others,&quot; Bungie said in a statement. &quot;It has since been confirmed that this was an act of terror aimed at Black Americans and is being investigated as a hate crime. Our hearts go out to the victims of this tragedy, and anyone impacted by this act of violence.&quot;


The studio, in collaboration with its Black at Bungie inclusion club, has announced a number of initiatives in response to the attack. It will, for instance, donate all profits made through the sale of its Be Heard collectable pin over the next 12 months to the Southern Poverty Law Center - a charity whose work includes &quot;monitoring hate groups and other extremists throughout the United States and exposing their activities to the public, the media, and law enforcement.&quot;

The funding package will also allow for Frogwares to supply its team with specialised equipment and migrate its data infrastructure.

                              <span>Sony has released its first PlayStation 5 bundle that includes Horizon Forbidden West.


The bundle has been spotted across UK stores - though of course it&#x27;s mostly sold out.


Released earlier this year, Horizon Forbidden West is Sony&#x27;s current premiere title for the console, though it was somewhat overshadowed by the release of Elden Ring a week later. This bundle should help to boost the game&#x27;s profile.

                              <span>EA DICE has removed the 128-player Breakthrough offering from Battlefield 2042 in its latest patch.


Update 4.1, which released today, has made substantial changes to the game&#x27;s All-Out Warfare playlists, which are available on current-gen consoles and PC. 


In a blog post, DICE explained the removal of 128-player Breakthrough lobbies was necessary to increase &quot;the value and impact of an individual player&quot;, as they currently were full of &quot;intensity and chaos&quot;.

Attorney general Letitia James announced the investigation last night, in response to the attack which killed 10 people and wounded three more. 


The perpetrator livestreamed the attack via Twitch for two minutes before the video was removed. Before the attack took place, he had posted numerous messages discussing and promoting his plans via Discord, as well as on the notorious imageboards 4chan and 8chan. All will now be part of James&#x27; invesitigation.

                              <span>Amanita Design - the developer behind the acclaimed likes of Samorost, Machinarium, Creaks, and last year&#x27;s surreal horror Happy Games - has unveiled its latest project: &quot;hand-crafted&quot; dystopian adventure Phonopolis.
Phonopolis, which makes use of actual corrugated cardboard sets and a 12fps stop-motion animation style inspired by classic animated films, casts players as Felix, a thoughtful young man who must try and stop the titular city&#x27;s authoritarian leader from playing the Absolute tone - an occurrence that would effectively cause Felix and his fellow citizens to lose their humanity.
What follows is a story-driven puzzle adventure encompassing &quot;relatable, real-world themes&quot;, including manipulation and individualism. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll be heavy going, though; Amanita says Phonopolis will explore its subject matter in a &quot;playful and light-hearted&quot; way.

                              <span>Naughty Dog&#x27;s much-rumoured, but as yet still unannounced, The Last of Us remake for PlayStation 5 will reportedly launch before the end of this year.


Word of a PlayStation 5 remake for The Last of Us first surfaced in April 2021 when Bloomberg reported the project had initially been in the works at Sony&#x27;s San Diego-based Visual Arts Service Group before Naughty Dog was asked to take over. Further evidence of the project&#x27;s existence emerged earlier this year, when a member of Naughty Dog&#x27;s QA team listed an &quot;unannounced remake&quot; on their resumé - a reference since removed.


Yet while there&#x27;s still no official word on a Last of Us remake, rumours of the project continue to swirl, with ever-leaky GamesBeat reporter Jeff Grubb now claiming it&#x27;s set for a 2022 release.

                              <span>Thunderful Games, the studio formed after the merger of developers Zoink and Image &amp; Form, has confirmed it currently has four SteamWorld titles in the works, including the previously announced SteamWorld Headhunter.


Headhunter - a &quot;stylised and colourful, third-person co-op action adventure&quot; that was announced last November - initially looked like it would be the sixth entry in the celebrated series, following on from SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Heist, SteamWorld Dig 2, and SteamWorld Quest. That may no longer be the case, however.


According to Thunderful&#x27;s latest earnings report (thanks IGN), Headhunter, which is now scheduled for a 2023 release, won&#x27;t be the only SteamWorld title coming that year. An accompany release schedule reveals that Thunderful has three additional, currently unannounced SteamWorld games in development, with two of those also due in 2023.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play team-based sports game Roller Champions finally has a release date and will, after a bit of a delay earlier this year, be launching next Wednesday, 25th May on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


Roller Champions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is Ubisoft&#x27;s stab at creating the kind of knockabout sports mash-up that&#x27;s made Rocket League such a perennial favourite, playing out like a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football - wherein two teams of three hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another and score a goal.


Is it any good? Time will tell, but Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell was pretty impressed when he played an early version shortly after its E3 2019 unveiling, calling it &quot;honestly one of the demos I found hardest to tear myself away from.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Spiders&#x27; scrappy but enjoyable RPG GreedFall is getting a sequel, and it&#x27;ll be launching for PC and unspecified consoles in 2024. Or next year - publisher Nacon&#x27;s press release and YouTube description currently disagree, which I&#x27;m trying to get to the bottom of.


When the original GreedFall launched in 2019, its combination of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice struck a bit of a chord despite its unavoidable rough edges, quickly raising its profile through plenty of positive word of mouth - ultimately, to the tune of over 2m sales - as players got stuck into its ambitious historical fantasy yarn.


&quot;GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults,&quot; said Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield in her review at the time, &quot;and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings.&quot;

The Road to Zero plan was first concieved in 2010, when Sony announced it as a &quot;a long-term global environmental plan... to realise a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of Sony&#x27;s products and business activities&quot;. Originally, this target of carbon neutrality was set for 2050. However, today the company released a statement revealing a new target year of 2040.
&quot;Sony will accelerate its target year for carbon neutrality, that is, greenhouse gas emissions of virtually zero, from 2050 to 2040. Specifically, Sony intends to make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations carbon neutral by 2030, and by 2040, in addition to scopes 1 and 2, Sony will also target other emissions originating from stages such as products, supply chains, and logistics (scope 3), aiming for net zero emissions achieved in all scopes.&quot;

                              <span>Last week, I got to have a closer look at the Saints Row reboot from Volition. As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.
However, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this &quot;stuff&quot; to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.
Throughout the showcase, Saints Row&#x27;s fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss&#x27; face, you could clearly see that the character&#x27;s eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss&#x27;, although their eye did look jarred as well).

                              <span>Following my hands off preview of the Saints Row reboot, I sat down and chatted more with Volition developers Kenzie Lindgren (associate UX designer) and Damien Allen (principal designer). We covered a broad range of topics, including plenty on what&#x27;s new for this entry, but we started by discussing why Saints Row aficionados should come back to the series, despite its brand-new cast and setting. 


&quot;It definitely still feels like Saints Row - even if it&#x27;s not the same characters, even if it&#x27;s not the same setting, even if it&#x27;s not exactly the same as before - it feels like Saints Row,&quot; Lindgren said.


&quot;I feel that every single time I go into the game, whether that&#x27;s just customisation (because customisation is a huge part of it), whether that&#x27;s travelling around the city, whether that&#x27;s wing suiting and doing the missions, it feels like Saints Row. And I think that&#x27;s at least worth checking out if you&#x27;re an older player, but also for a newer player to discover that feeling for the first time.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 news will come next month, according to director Tetsuya Nomura.


During a Japanese livestream covering the mobile battle royale Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier, Nomura mentioned that news would be coming next month as part of the Final Fantasy 7 25th anniversary.


Presumably this could be news on part two of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, as well as other projects in the works.

This paid-for add-on lets you fling birds at pigs, as is tradition, now in blocky 3D.  There&#x27;s a story mode, which plays like a classic Minecraft map, or a full-on version of the classic Angry Birds gameplay, converted into Minecraft.

The expansion is the work of Oreville Studios, a developer dedicated to building content on the Minecraft Marketplace platform, and looks... decent? Here&#x27;s a trailer showing gameplay:

                              <span>For those who had a PlayStation 3 in 2009, Shatter was a must play. Its block-busting gameplay was married with a slamming soundtrack that made it an ideal way to pass some time while waiting for the release of Fast and Furious and other classics of that year. However, if you didn&#x27;t have the chance to bop along with this sci-fi puzzler then, now is your chance. 
Yes, that&#x27;s right, the game is getting remastered. And, not only that, it is also coming to even more consoles than before. In &quot;late 2022&quot;, you will be able to play Shatter Remastered Deluxe on Windows and Mac for PC (via Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. You are, quite simply, spoiled for choice. 
You can check out the announcement trailer for Shatter Remastered Deluxe below.

The Chant is the second game in as many weeks to prioritise its current-gen console launches, following the recent cancellation of Gotham Knights for PS4 and Xbox One. 

A fresh trailer has shown off the game&#x27;s story, and confirmed its lack of current-gen consoles:

As reported back in March, hair and fur textures were tanking the frame rate when played on PC - sometimes as low as 8FPS. Modders have released fixes which make all characters bald in a bid to alleviate the issue.



Now an update has been released for the game, in which &quot;models for hair and fur associated with important characters have been revised to improve performance.&quot;

                              <span>Solo developer Stephen Ddungu believes Disney and Marvel likely copied his indie game for an eye-catching fight sequence in the recent Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.


Ddungu has been chronicling his work on music-based JRPG Sword of Symphony via Tiktok, where footage of the game&#x27;s combat system has notched up millions of views (thanks, Kotaku). 


His game allows you to conjur glowing musical notes in mid-air and send them flinging towards an enemy. If you&#x27;ve seen the new Doctor Strange, you&#x27;ll likely recognise that description - since a short sequence in the film sees Benedict Cumberbatch doing just that.

                              <span>Following Activision Blizzard&#x27;s reveal of its Diversity Space Tool, a video of a GDC 2017 presentation has resurfaced online.


In the video, presenters of the tool embarrassingly apply their findings to Nintendo&#x27;s series.


Apparently the game lacks diversity in ability and sexual orientation, as the characters aren&#x27;t disabled and are all presumed straight. How you can tell someone&#x27;s sexual orientation just by looking at them is beyond me.

The investment means the PIF is now Nintendo&#x27;s fifth-largest shareholder, Bloomberg reported this morning. 


In response, Nintendo said it learned of the stake from news reports and declined to comment further.

Rumours surfaced earlier this week that a remake of the PS2 horror game was in the works, alongside other projects in the series.


However, speaking to IGN at Polish games conference Digital Dragons, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno said he cannot comment, but the studio hopes to make an announcement on future projects &quot;as soon as we can&quot;.

                              <span>Researchers have demonstrated iPhone malware that works even when the phone is fully shut down.
t turns out that the iPhone’s Bluetooth chip­ — which is key to making features like Find My work­ — has no mechanism for digitally signing or even encrypting the firmware it runs. Academics at Germany’s Technical University of Darmstadt figured out how to exploit this lack of hardening to run malicious firmware that allows the attacker to track the phone’s location or run new features when the device is turned off.
[…]
The research is the first — or at least among the first — to study the risk posed by chips running in low-power mode. Not to be confused with iOS’s low-power mode for conserving battery life, the low-power mode (LPM) in this research allows chips responsible for near-field communication, ultra wideband, and Bluetooth to run in a special mode that can remain on for 24 hours after a device is turned off...</span>

                              <span>From Elden Ring on Game Boy to that Advance Wars/Mass Effect mash-up, demakes are all the rage these days - and now it&#x27;s classic first-person puzzler Portal&#x27;s turn to get the retro port treatment, courtesy of a new fan project to rebuild it for N64.


Portal, of course, released back in 2007 as part of Valve&#x27;s legendary Orange Box collection, where it immediately wrought cake memes, Companion Cubes and iconic antagonist GLaDOS upon an unsuspecting world. It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.


The currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve&#x27;s classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.

                              <span>Following recent reports that Sony is refusing to approve any statements from PlayStation studios relating to reproductive rights, Bungie - whose acquisition by Sony was announced in February - has said &quot;there will never be a &#x27;muzzle&#x27; big enough to stop us from standing up for what&#x27;s right&quot;.
Bungie was one of the first studios to speak out in support of Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the US, following recent reports the US Supreme Court was trying to overturn the ruling. At the time, the developer called the move a &quot;direct attack on human rights&quot;, adding that &quot;standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values&quot;.
However, in light of reports that Sony is refusing to authorise any public statements its PlayStation studios might want to make around the issue of reproductive rights, some Bungie fans have questioned whether the developer will still be able to express its opinion so freely once its acquisition by Sony is complete.

                              <span>Developer The Bearded Ladies, the studio behind 2018&#x27;s acclaimed turn-based strategy adventure Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, has unveiled Miasma Chronicles - a new tactical RPG that&#x27;s heading to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 some time next year.


Miasma Chronicles unfolds in a United States torn apart by a force known only as the Miasma, some time in the &quot;not-too-distant future&quot;. Here, in the mining town of Sedentary, we meet our protagonist Elvis, a young man raised by a robotic older &quot;brother&quot; after being left by his mother. 


Elvis, for reasons both unknown and extremely convenient as far as gameplay goes, has access to a mysterious glove that enables him to control Miasma - a device that&#x27;ll almost certainly prove useful as the brothers set out across the post-apocalyptic wasteland in search of answers that might &quot;change the course of human history forever.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Bohemia Interactive has, following an extensive leak over the weekend, officially unveiled Arma Reforger, the next step in its long-running first-person military shooter series. Described as the &quot;first milestone on the long road to Arma 4&quot;, Reforger launches into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access today.


Bohemia opened a lengthy livestream earlier today with confirmation that the long-awaited Arma 4 is in development (its predecessor, Arma 3, celebrates its 10th birthday next year), but the remainder of the stream&#x27;s focus was very much on Reforger. It&#x27;s being called a new standalone &quot;platform&quot; for the series, consisting of several key parts; there&#x27;s a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.


Reforger&#x27;s sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia&#x27;s previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001&#x27;s Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer&#x27;s latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.

                              <span>Fortnite has teased the return of an enormous icon from its original Island, as the clock counts down to the game&#x27;s latest big season finale.


While not yet confirmed by developer Epic Games, eagle-eyed Fortnite leakers are confident this season will end in another of the game&#x27;s eye-catching live events - the first of 2022 - likely on Saturday, 4th June.


This afternoon, Epic itself issued a typically cryptic teaser with snippets of audio and an unmistakable logo at the end: the fan-favourite Mech (or Mecha Team Leader, to give its full name) which duelled and ultimately beat Fortnite&#x27;s Devourer monster in one of the game&#x27;s most memorable moments back in 2019.

                              <span>May&#x27;s second crop of games headed to Xbox Game Pass includes Jurassic World Evolution 2, available today, plus Sniper Elite 5 and Pac-Man Museum+.


Jurassic World Evolution 2 is the dinosaur management sim sequel which adds in plenty of new features and creatures, including flying and airborne reptiles. 


Developer Frontier last year admitted the game had under-performed, something it blamed on the delay of the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion movie, now due in June. Here&#x27;s hoping Xbox Game Pass gives it fresh legs.

                              <span>Lost Ark still has a bot problem, publisher Amazon Games has admitted. 


In a blog post acknowledging the continued issue and the ongoing &quot;frustration within the community&quot; it said it had felt too, Amazon announced it had permanently banned &quot;several million accounts that participated in botting, hacking or gold-selling&quot;.


&quot;Since Lost Ark launched, we&#x27;ve been fighting a war against the bots infiltrating Arkesia,&quot; Amazon dramatically wrote. &quot;Addressing bots can be especially challenging in free-to-play games because it&#x27;s so easy to create an account and enter the game, but we&#x27;re working on multiple fronts to fight them.&quot;

                              <span>Red Dead Online publisher Take-Two has acknowledged fan frustration over the lack of meaningful updates to Rockstar&#x27;s online cowboy offering - though said it was up to developer Rockstar to say what it was - or wasn&#x27;t - up to.


Speaking to IGN, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he had &quot;heard the frustration&quot; surrounding the game from fans who felt sidelined, and who have campaigned for more content using the hashtag #SaveRedDeadOnline. 


&quot;Rockstar Games talks about the updates that are coming, and we&#x27;re working on an awful lot at Rockstar Games,&quot; Zelnick said. &quot;I&#x27;ve heard the frustration, it&#x27;s flattering that they want more content, and more will be said by Rockstar in due time.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 15 has now sold more than 10m copies worldwide since its launch back in November 2016.


The new sales milestone was announced today via the official Final Fantasy 15 Twitter account.


While a sizable number, it&#x27;s interesting to compare it to the 11.8m copies sold by the Square Enix-published Rise of the Tomb Raider, launched back in 2015, or the 14.5m copies sold by the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot - especially in light of Square Enix ditching its western game studios, such as Tomb Raider&#x27;s Crystal Dynamics.

The menus are shown, followed by new footage from Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2, and Sonic CD.

Speaking to IGN, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said Take-Two - a potential new home for the FIFA brand, post-EA - was keen to continue expanding its sports portfolio, but did not have anything to announce regarding FIFA at the moment. 


&quot;We&#x27;re definitely interested in expanding our opportunities in sports,&quot; Zelnick said, &quot;and FIFA has a great brand and incredible clout, but we have no current plans to discuss.&quot;

The sale to Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive marks another studio gone from Improbable, as it ditches its previous designs on video game development backed by its ever-nebulous SpatialOS cloud technology.

As a result of the sale, Scavengers&#x27; console versions - currently being tested via a closed alpha - have been cancelled, Eurogamer has been told. Its PC version currently remains alive, as a small internal team keeps it operational.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has released a suitably ridiculous new cinematic trailer for its Smash-Bros-like free-to-play crossover brawler Multiversus, confirming a handful of previously unannounced playable characters alongside the news its open beta will be launching this July.


Multiversus was officially unveiled last November following a string of leaks, and now, after and a steady stream of reveals focused on its increasingly proposterous character roster - where the likes of Game of Thrones&#x27; Arya Stark can battle against Scooby Doo&#x27;s Shaggy - it finally enters invite-only closed alpha later this week.


Multiversus&#x27; closed alpha runs from 19th-27th May, giving participants access to 15 playable fighters, seven maps, and a selection of different modes.

                              <span>Spacefaring sim sequel Kerbal Space Program 2 - which has faced repeated delays since its unveiling in 2019 - has been delayed yet again, and is now expected to arrive in &quot;early 2023&quot; on PC, with a console release to follow later in that year.


Kerbal Space Program 2 was first confirmed to be in development during Gamescom 2019, where it slapped with what would prove to be an extremely optimistic 2020 release date. Publisher Private Division later adjusted that to &quot;fiscal 2021&quot; - sometime between April 2020 and March 2021 - and then pushed it back once again to autumn 2021.


That still wasn&#x27;t the end of the delays, however; as 2020 drew to a close, developer Intercept Games revealed it had made the decision to postpone release yet again, this time to some nebulous point in 2022, citing the &quot;immense technical and creative challenge&quot; of developing the sequel. And now, Kerbal Space Program 2&#x27;s release has shifted once more.

                              <span>Netflix will be giving its Cyberpunk 2077 animated series a first airing - alongside glimpses of its live-action Resident Evil show and Cuphead season 2 - during its Geeked Week event in June.


Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, which was announced back in June 2020 well before Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s troubled launch, is a 10-episode collaboration between CD Projekt and Japanese animation studio Trigger, which has previously worked on Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill.


At the time of its announcement, CD Projekt said the series would follows the adventures of a street kid trying to survive in a technology- and body-modification-obsessed city of the future. &quot;Having everything to lose,&quot; went the official blurb, &quot;he chooses to stay alive by becoming an edgerunner — a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk.&quot;

                              <span>Following a controversial email last week, in which PlayStation boss Jim Ryan asked staff to &quot;respect differences of opinion&quot; on abortion rights, a new report has claimed Sony is currently refusing to approve any statements its PlayStation studios might want to make on the topic of reproductive rights in response to the US Supreme Court&#x27;s proposal to reverse the ruling of Roe v Wade, with Insomniac head Ted Price going as far as to tell staff he believed there would be &quot;material repercussions&quot; if it went against Sony&#x27;s wishes.


According to a new report by The Washington Post, Spider-Man and Ratchet &amp; Clank developer Insomniac, which was acquired by Sony in 2020, had made the decision to donate $50,000 USD to the Women&#x27;s Reproductive Rights Assistance Project (WRRAP) following the US Supreme Court&#x27;s recent proposal to reverse Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the country - a donation Sony has agreed to match, along with any additional donations from staff, as part of company&#x27;s &quot;PlayStation Cares&quot; programme.


However, according to the Washington Post, Sony won&#x27;t authorise any public statement Insomniac might want to make about reproductive rights or its donation, and staff have been expressly forbidden from mentioning either Sony or Insomniac in any retweet should the WRRAP choose to make an announcement about the donation. &quot;[Sony Interactive Entertainment] will not approve ANY statements from any studio on the topic of reproductive rights,&quot; Insomniac head Ted Price told studio employees in an email dated 13th May. &quot;We fought hard for this and we did not win.”

As part of its transition to free-to-play, Fall Guys - which celebrates its second birthday later this year - will be hitting the reset button, and 21st June will see it re-launching with a new season that Mediatonic is referring to as Season 1: Free For All, promising &quot;stacks of new challenges and rewards&quot;.


As with Rocket League before it, which similarly went free-to-play after being snapped up by Epic Games, Fall Guys will be adapting a monetisation model that&#x27;ll be immediately familiar to Fortnite players. That means the arrival of a new paid premium Season Pass - purchasable with a new in-game currency known as Show-Bucks - that&#x27;ll sit alongside the existing free tier.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly developing an Xbox and PC app to let you create your own dynamic backgrounds. 


As spotted by notorious Microsoft leaker Aggiornamenti Lumia and Windows Central, the in-progress app looks like it will let you add up to eight concurrent visual effects to custom imagery. You can then layer said effects over a timeline, creating an animated background for your PC or console.


Microsoft took a little while to add dynamic backgrounds to Xbox, but there are now an array to choose from, including themes which nod back to the Xbox console family&#x27;s past, as well as to favourite franchises such as Halo.

As a reminder, the new PlayStation Plus tiers will arrive here in the UK on 23rd June, as with elsewhere in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. This follows the service&#x27;s launch in the Americas on 13th June, Japan on 2nd June, and Asia next week on 24th May.


Included with both the new Extra and Premium tiers, the PS4 and PS5 Game Catalogue will include numerous recent PlayStation exclusives, including Returnal, Death Stranding: Director&#x27;s Cut, Demon&#x27;s Souls, Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut and Horizon Zero Dawn.

That&#x27;s a question answered by YouTube creator ZeoNyph, who&#x27;s produced a short video of a demake done using Blender software.


It&#x27;s a fun video homage, with all the hallmarks of a PS1 game.

Robocop is available to buy for 1500 V-Bucks, with accessories including a LEG-209 pickaxe (the leg of rival ED-209), as well as a little ED-209 to ride around on as a traversal remote (500 V-Bucks apiece). 


The appearance of Robocop is the first retro-era icon in a while, though Fortnite has in the past welcomed characters from Terminator, Alien, Tron, Ghostbusters and Predator. Here&#x27;s how Robocop looks, dusted off and back in action:

                              <span>Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment has laid out its upcoming slate of projects - and there&#x27;s a lot on the cards. 


Of course, there&#x27;s the upcoming long, long-awaited Alan Wake 2. Last week we glimpsed some new concept art, though were told not to expect any big reveal this summer as originally planned. Still, word of a Nintendo Switch release of the original game and a TV series in development all sounded positive.


&quot;Alan Wake 2 is in the full production stage,&quot; Remedy wrote in its latest financial results. &quot;A lot of work remains, but the game is starting to take a more complete form in many areas. As communicated earlier, Alan Wake 2 will be released in 2023.&quot;

What&#x27;s more, the range of these summons has been extended, meaning they can be summoned more frequently and in more places on the map, following the player like Skyrim&#x27;s companions.

                              <span>Twitch and Discord have issued statements following the deadly mass shooting in Buffalo, New York at the weekend, which is being investigated as a racially-motivated attack.


10 people died and three more were injured in the shooting, all but two of whom were African-American. 


The perpetrator, an 18-year-old white man, livestreamed the attack on Twitch, and planned it via a private server on Discord.

                              <span>Staff at Activision Blizzard have criticised the company&#x27;s diversity tool that was revealed over the weekend.


Known as the Diversity Space Tool, it was started in 2016 and has been in beta at mobile studio King. It&#x27;s intended to boost the diversity of characters in games, but has been criticised for belittling diversity and diminishing it to a checklist.


A blog post about the tool was shared on 12th May, but has since been heavily edited. Originally it mentioned the Overwatch 2 team was experimenting with the tool, but this has since been removed.

                              <span>Rob Joyce, the director of cybersecurity at the NSA, said so in an interview:
The NSA already has classified quantum-resistant algorithms of its own that it developed over many years, said Joyce. But it didn’t enter any of its own in the contest. The agency’s mathematicians, however, worked with NIST to support the process, trying to crack the algorithms in order to test their merit.
“Those candidate algorithms that NIST is running the competitions on all appear strong, secure, and what we need for quantum resistance,” Joyce said. “We’ve worked against all of them to make sure they are solid.”...</span>

The volume populators feature is now two releases old and entering beta! The AnyVolumeDataSouce feature
gate defaults to enabled in Kubernetes v1.24, which means that users can specify any custom resource
as the data source of a PVC.
An earlier blog article detailed how the
volume populators feature works. In short, a cluster administrator can install a CRD and
associated populator controller in the cluster, and any user who can create instances of
the CR can create pre-populated volumes by taking advantage of the populator.
Multiple populators can be installed side by side for different purposes. The SIG storage
community is already seeing some implementations in public, and more prototypes should
appear soon.
Cluster administrations are strongly encourag…</span>

Forced to match the local prices on the Epic Games Stores across the world - regardless of each country&#x27;s own economy or the fact the game has already launched - Sony&#x27;s prices have absolutely rocketed for some, with places like Brazil seeing a price hike of 276 per cent (thanks, TechRaptor).

In the UK, players will actually see a saving - the price here has dropped from £16 to £13 - and in Canada, it&#x27;s jumped a little from $22CAD to $27CAD.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns has just been age-rated in South Korea.

The age classification - deliberated on 13th May and published on Friday - suggests the tactical card-battle RPG may be coming to PC, Switch, and PlayStation and Xbox consoles sooner than expected. 

As spotted by a members of r/LeaksandRumours, the RPG has been awarded a 15 rating, the description for which explains how Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns will take on the Hydra in a game. The board cites the game&#x27;s &quot;many expressions that look like violence and blood towards living things&quot; as the reason why it was given a 15 rating.

Though not remotely confirmed - so just take this with the proverbial bucket of salt for now until we&#x27;re told anything more conclusive - journalist and podcaster Nick Baker said on the Xbox Era podcast that Microsoft&#x27;s first-party shooter franchise may be getting the &quot;Master Chief Collection-type treatment&quot;.

Conducted by Famitsu and translated by FrontlineJP (thanks, NME), the survey was completed by 1700 people, the majority of whom (1509) were male and aged 25-29. 

Almost all respondents confirmed they loved the story and world of Elden Ring, as well as exploration, the field, and boss combat. Item crafting and the upgrade system for equipment were the least favourite aspects of Elden Ring.

As first reported by Windows Central, Atlus has circulated a consumer survey to players asking a whole slew of questions about their gaming preferences. 
While not unusual in and of itself - it&#x27;s an annual survey, after all - question 38 has Persona fans cautiously optimistic that mainline entries of the franchise may finally make their way to Xbox.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s housing lottery system issues have now been fixed.

Producer and director, Naoki Yoshida, confirmed that, while &quot;extensive and persistent&quot;, the errors will  be resolved when the game goes into maintenance mode tomorrow, 16th May. 

It&#x27;s taken a full month to fix the issue, though. Back in April, Yoshida apologised to players for ongoing issues with the MMORPG&#x27;s new housing lottery system that prevented players from winning any land. Writing on the official website, he explain what the team was doing to address a problem in which players were being told their bids were unsuccessful because there &quot;were no participants in this lottery&quot;, or that the winning number was &quot;0&quot;... even though no players can be assigned that number.

                              <span>New details about Striking Distance Studios&#x27; new sci-fi horror, The Callisto Protocol, are set to be revealed next week.
That&#x27;s according to Striking Distance Studios CEO Glen Schofield, who teased yesterday that &quot;now might be a good time to start&quot; keeping an eye on updates from the studio.

Up until now, the studio has been playing its cards very close to the chest indeed, but yesterday - fittingly Friday 13th - Schofield teased on his personal Twitter account that we should &quot;look for some news next week&quot;, before dropping the wondeerfully gross image of a close-up of one of The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s creatures below.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Bohemia Interactive dropped a save the date for &quot;Future of Arma&quot;, an upcoming livestream set to reveal what&#x27;s next for the tactical military shooter.

Earlier today, however, an alleged marketing and brand guide leaked online, revealing that a new multi-platform instalment, Arma Reforger, is on the way to PC. It looks like it&#x27;s set to come to Xbox and PlayStation consoles, too, although the wording is a tad confusing, so it&#x27;s possible the PS4 and PS5 release will come &quot;in the future&quot;.

The leak intimates that the company is set to announce Arma 4 alongside Reforger, which has been called a &quot;more focused&quot; title that will &quot;introduce Arma to a new console-oriented audience&quot; with a &quot;very strong multiplayer focus&quot; that will &quot;test new technology and design decisions to form the foundation for Arma 4.&quot;

                              <span>Just weeks after confirming it was selling off its western studios and IP to Embracer Group for $300m, Square Enix has revealed plans to &quot;establish new studios&quot; and acquire others.

The news came as part of the company&#x27;s recent financial presentation, which revealed that one of Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;medium-term business strategy&quot; initiatives is to &quot;boost game development capabilities by establishing new studios, [mergers and acquisitions], etc.&quot;

As spotted by Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo (thanks, NME), the company also revealed that the &quot;objectives behind divestiture of select overseas studios and IP&quot; - that is, the reason why it sold off its three western studios - was to &quot;achieve sustained growth through selection and concentration of company sources, better align overseas publishing function with organisation in Tokyo, and transform group business portfolio&quot;.

                              <span>Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé has hinted that &quot;some developer is playing around with an idea&quot; that may bring Nintendo&#x27;s space racer F-Zero back to life.

In an interview with VentureBeat, Fils-Aimé confirmed that a developer rarely &quot;makes a conscious decision not to continue supporting&quot; a franchise, stating that - &quot;at least during [his] tenure&quot; - Nintendo is always experimenting with ways to make new games… or apply new ideas to an existing franchise. 

&quot;Why was F-Zero abandoned?&quot; he said. &quot;The insight I would share is that, at least during my tenure, Nintendo developers were always experimenting with different gameplay styles, always thinking about where a unique experience could be applied back, either to an existing franchise or maybe creating a new franchise.

                              <span>Stardew Valley has now sold over 20 million copies. 

That means the wholesome farming simulator has doubled its 10 million sales since January 2020, and sold five million copies since September 2021 alone.

&quot;The 20 million copies milestone is really amazing,&quot; Stardew Valley creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone said in an email to PC Gamer. &quot;I can&#x27;t believe the game has reached this level.

                              <span>It&#x27;s all go for American Truck Simulator; not only does SCS Software currently have its hands full working on its previously announced Montana and Texas expansions, the developer has also been beavering away on its major California overhaul - and phase two of that work is now available in a new update.


California was, of course, one of two states included at American Truck Simulator&#x27;s launch back in 2016 (the other being Nevada), and has been starting to show in age in recent times, particularly alongside SCS&#x27; increasingly impressive work on newer state expansions.


As such, the developer pledged a refresh for the ageing location back in 2020, with the aim of bringing it up to current mapping standards. The first phase of this rework arrived last July, making significant changes to California&#x27;s northern road network, adding (and in a few cases, removing) scenery towns, and introducing Border Protection Stations.

                              <span>If this week&#x27;s two previously announced Epic Games Store freebies somehow aren&#x27;t enough to be getting on with, Epic has also, rather unexpectedly, thrown in a third offering - taking the form of developer 34BigThings&#x27; blisteringly fast, wonderfully stylish anti-grav racer Redout.


Redout initially launched all the way back in 2016, immediately dazzling with its gorgeous, high-speed racing, and did well enough that it was followed up by no less than five expansions, introducing a host of new courses to sate those smitten with its core action.


The free Epic Store version doesn&#x27;t include all those post-launch goodies, but it does deliver 11 event types across 25 tracks and five locations, alongside a robust career mode, extensive customisation, and online multiplayer for up to 12 racers. Which, to be honest, should be more than enough to keep you amused if this is your first time in Redout&#x27;s world.

                              <span>Game grading company Wata Games is the target of a new US class action lawsuit accusing it of unfair business practices and of manipulating the retro gaming market for its own gain.


As reported by VGC, the lawsuit was filed on 10th May in the Central District of California, representing class members (estimated to be as many as 10,000 individuals) who all paid for game grading and other services by Wata. It accuses Wata of &quot;engaging in affirmative acts to manipulate the retro video game market&quot; and of &quot;engaging in unfair business practices&quot;, specifically pointing the figure at Wata president and CEO Deniz Kahn.

Kahn is accused of working with auction house Heritage Auctions co-founder Jim Halperin - a previous Wata investor and advisory board member - to manipulate the retro games market through promotional efforts and media interviews, in which the pair are said to have claimed that retro games prices would continue to rise.

                              <span>Sonic remains Sega&#x27;s biggest franchise, as the publisher releases its latest financial results.


The company has seen a significant increase in its sales over the past year (totalling 320.0bn yen), with Entertainment Contents (divided into full games and free-to-play games, as well as arcade machines, toys, and animation) contributing the most (235.9bn yen).


With 5.8m units, the Sonic franchise remains Sega&#x27;s biggest seller by a considerable margin, but Yakuza and Total War are strong.

                              <span>Fortnite looks set to dramatically upgrade its user-made creative capabilities later this year, when Epic Games releases the Unreal Editor for Fortnite. 


Speaking to Fast Company, Epic boss Tim Sweeney said the release would allow &quot;the full capabilities that you&#x27;ve seen [in Unreal Engine] opened up so that anybody can build very high-quality game content and code... and deploy it into Fortnite without having to do a deal with us - it&#x27;s open to everybody&quot;.


Fortnite already has a Creative mode where you can build your own Fortnite island or mini-game using Epic-designed props and game design options. But collaborations with brands and monetisation of content has remained controlled by Epic itself.

                              <span>Eurogamer is delighted to announce the return of its paid work experience programme for ethnic minorities, following its successful debut last year. 


The programme will once again run for two months this summer, with applications now open, exclusively to those from ethnic minorities who live in the UK. 


As we wrote last year when launching the scheme initially, the games media has a diversity problem and Eurogamer is no exception. It is on us to help affect change and continue improving representation, so that the games media better reflects the gaming community as a whole.

Starship Troopers: Terran Command is a traditional-looking real-time strategy game set in the Starship Troopers universe. As you&#x27;d expect, you take command of the mobile infantry and go to war against the Arachnid threat.


The video below shows how this plays out in the game - you generate troops, troops and more troops, who gain experience and battlefield prowess as they eradicate the enemy. The trick is keeping experienced troops alive long enough to get truly powerful. Once the last soldier in a squad is killed, that squad is toast.

                              <span>Publisher Slitherine has shown off half an hour of upcoming real-time tactics game Stargate: Timekeepers, while confirming plans to release a beta to coincide with the much-loved SG1 TV series&#x27; 25th anniversary in July.


The video, below, shows the Stargate: Timekeepers segment of Slitherine&#x27;s Home of Wargamers event. It debuts the In Plain Site mission, in which the Stargate team, including sniper Max Bolton and technical officer Sam Watson, attempt to put down a sacrifice ritual inside the Jaffa village by disguising themselves as the enemy.


The stealth heavy Stargate: Timekeepers, developed by Creative Forge Games (Hard West, Phantom Doctrine), looks heavily inspired by the Commandos series (this is not a guns blazing type of game). The campaign departs from the end of season seven of the Stargate SG-1 main plot with an original story starting during the Battle of Antarctica. It unfolds over 14 missions, each of which lasts around an hour, and revolves around unravelling a timeloop mystery and defeating the Goa&#x27;uld threat.

You can watch the moment Grubb confirms the name in the video below (skip to 1:17).

                              <span>Angry PlayStation employees have leaked an internal email sent by company boss Jim Ryan, in which he asked staff to &quot;respect differences of opinion&quot; on abortion rights. 


The email, excerpts from which were posted by Bloomberg, landed in PlayStation employee inboxes yesterday. In it, Ryan addressed a number of subjects - including the ongoing controversy over the US Supreme Court&#x27;s proposed work to ditch the key abortion rights case Roe v Wade.


While not expressing a personal stance, Ryan did suggest staff acknowledge &quot;we owe it to each other and to PlayStation&#x27;s millions of users to respect differences of opinion among everyone in our internal and external communities.

                              <span>Square Enix has released its financial results for the past year, which have kept afloat thanks to Final Fantasy 14.


Net sales for the publisher were 365.3m yen, with 51m yen profit. Those net sales dropped almost 10 percent compared to the previous year, which saw the release of Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Marvel&#x27;s Avengers.


However, net sales in the MMO sector increased, due &quot;not only to a sharp rise in the number of monthly paying subscribers for Final Fantasy 14, but also to the release of an expansion pack for the title&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox must work to &quot;better meet expectations&quot;, boss Phil Spencer has said, reflecting on yesterday&#x27;s bombshell delay of both Starfield and Redfall. 


The shift for both Bethesda games until the first half of nextyear leaves the Xbox first-party game slate for 2022 looking decidedly bare. 


Addressing the news, Spencer said such decisions were &quot;hard on teams making the games and our fans&quot;. He continued: &quot;While I fully support giving teams time to release these great games when they are ready, we hear the feedback.

In a call for staff applications to various open roles on the project, Funcom released two pieces of artwork that give us our first sense of the vibe this new Dune game is going for.

There&#x27;s also an additional piece of art, showing a man, maker hook in hand, presumably about to pounce upon a sand worm.

Now you can configure startup, liveness, and readiness probes for your gRPC app
without exposing any HTTP endpoint, nor do you need an executable. Kubernetes can natively connect to your your workload via gRPC and query its status.
Some history
It&#x27;s useful to let the system managing your workload check that the app is
healthy, has started OK, and whether the app considers itself good to accept
traffic. Before the gRPC support was added, Kubernetes already allowed you to
check for health based on running an executable from inside the container image,
by making an HTTP request, or by checking whether a TCP connection succeeded.
For most apps, those checks are enough.…</span>

                              <span>Way back in 2018, developer Remedy Entertainment announced it was working to adapt its beloved supernatural horror adventure Alan Wake for television - and now, some four years later, it finally has an update on the project, announcing it&#x27;s partnering with The Walking Dead network AMC to bring the show to life.


Alan Wake, for the uninitiated, debuted on Xbox 360 back in 2010, and its small-town horror, in which the titular novelist battles supernatural forces armed with little more than a flashlight and an endless urge to monologue, quickly gained cult classic status. But while all was quiet on the Alan front for over a decade, he&#x27;s had something of a resurgence in recent times.


Alongside a prominent role in Remedy&#x27;s acclaimed Control - specifically in its second DLC, known as AWE - Alan Wake was given the remaster treatment in 2021 (a release now confirmed for Switch) and will be getting a long-awaited sequel some time next year. As such, a TV series expanding Alan&#x27;s reach still further seems like the next logical step for Remedy.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been pining for the return of Ubisoft&#x27;s impressively enduring Rabbids ahead of their flagship appearance in this year&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope on Switch, you&#x27;re in luck: Ubisoft has announced it&#x27;ll be giving its previously China-exclusive game Rabbids: Adventure Party a global release at some point before the end of next month.


Rabbids: Adventure Party initially launched for Switch in 2020, sending the titular nuisances back in time for some hijinks inspired by classic Chinese novel Journey to the West - and for some minigame action played using the Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers.


There&#x27;ll be a number of notable changes for Rabbids: Adventure Party come its global release, however. For starters, according to Ubisoft&#x27;s latest earnings report, it&#x27;ll be getting a new name, becoming the slightly less catchy Rabbids: Party of Legends, and will be branching out onto other platforms in addition to Switch - namely Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Stadia.

                              <span>Dead Space fans eager to get their hands on EA Motive&#x27;s promising remake of developer Visceral Games&#x27; much-loved sci-fi horror classic now have a date to scrawl in their diaries; EA has confirmed it&#x27;ll be releasing for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 27th January next year.


Announced last July, the Dead Space remake is a ground-up reworking of the 2008 original, promising to raise &quot;the level of horror and immersion to unprecedented heights&quot;. Of course, players still step into the shoes of engineer Isaac Clarke as they take their terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura - battling the nightmarish necromorphs along the way - but EA Motive&#x27;s version promises to bring enhanced audio and visuals, alongside other tweaks include improved story, characters, and game mechanics.


Following the remake&#x27;s official unveiling, EA Motive has given Dead Space fans a surprisingly thorough behind-the-scenes look at its development, revealing more on its gameplay changes, audio, and art across three separate livestreams.

                              <span>Alan Wake Remastered, the spruced-up version of developer Remedy&#x27;s cult-classic action-horror, is officially launching on Switch this autumn. Additionally, the developer has offered an update on its long-awaited Alan Wake 2, saying it has made the decision to delay the larger reveal it had originally told fans to expect this summer.


Alan Wake Remastered - which bundles together the base game plus its two expansions, The Signal and The Writer - launched for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC last October, giving Remedy&#x27;s much-loved original a welcome modern-day makeover with the likes of richer environmental detail and enhanced character models.


A Switch version of Alan Wake Remastered wasn&#x27;t previously been announced by Remedy, but a surprise listing pointing to a release on Nintendo&#x27;s platform was spotted on the Brazilian ratings board website last September.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re talking FIFA - or from next year, EA Sports FC. The breakup of FIFA and EA has sparked numerous headlines this week, as both sides have claimed the deal is good for them.

On EA&#x27;s part, it has said freedom from the FIFA organisation will allow it to do far more with its football game.  (It will also, of course, save the hefty sum it paid for those four letters on the front of its box.) As for FIFA, it has said its brand is the thing that matters, and it&#x27;ll be fine without EA. Indeed, to quote FIFA president Gianni Infantino, &quot;the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST&quot;. So there&#x27;s that.
But behind all the bluster, what do we think EA Sports FC will really look like in future? And does FIFA stand any chance of coming up with a rival game developed in time for next year? Joining me to discuss all of that are Eurogamer news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan, plus resident footy fan Wesley Yin-Poole.

Over 30 improvements and options have been added in this latest update, including - at last! - the option to navigate menus using directional buttons instead of a cursor.


Also included are gameplay settings to customise combat difficulty and game speed, and new HUD and subtitle options, which can be found in a new accessibility category in the options menu.

                              <span>Pokémon Home, the franchise&#x27;s creature storage app for Switch and mobile phones, will soon add support for new releases Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl. 


Support for these games - which was expected, but still not yet dated - will arrive &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;, The Pokémon Company said today. 


It sounds like Arceus&#x27; story and mechanics have prompted a few workarounds to the normal Home formula - as already supported in Pokémon Sword/Shield, Let&#x27;s Go Pikachu/Eevee and Pokémon Go.

&quot;Over the last few months, we have focused on adding some of your most requested features, such as New Game + mode, FOV slider for consoles, and many co-op improvements,&quot; the developer wrote today. &quot;On top of that, in June, we will introduce the first game Chapter entitled &#x27;In the Footsteps of a Nightrunner,&#x27; filled with content and events, as well as the highly anticipated photo mode.
&quot;That being said, we need a bit more time to develop the first story DLC, which is now planned to be released in September.&quot;

The 8-bit game centres around you and your dog Data, as you navigate around PrivaCity. Your task is to get Data safely to the park, dodging cat ads and battling trolls.

                              <span>Valve has lost its bid to end the antitrust case over its Steam platform.
The original lawsuit, which we reported on in January 2021, saw Valve accused of abusing Steam&#x27;s market power to prevent price competition.
Now, Judge John C. Coughenour says it is possible that the company does use its influence to do just that.

The lawsuit, which was filed by Riot&#x27;s parent company Tencent, reads: &quot;This action seeks to stop Moonton from continuing its deliberate and sustained campaign to free ride on Riot&#x27;s highly valuable rights in the mobile video game League of Legends: Wild Rift and related content.&quot; The company goes on to call Moonton&#x27;s strategy &quot;blatant copying&quot;.
The lawsuit continues, &quot;Over the years, as Riot updated its video game, Moonton would copy it. When Riot updated the game&#x27;s promotional materials, Moonton copied them. And when Riot released a new trailer, Moonton copied it. This is a critical issue for Riot.

The company has also announced a similar delay - again, to the first half of 2023 - for Redfall. 

&quot;We&#x27;ve made the decision to delay the launches of Redfall and Starfield to the first half of 2023,&quot; Bethesda announced via Twitter today. &quot;The teams at Arkane Austin (Redfall) and Bethesda Game Studios (Starfield) have incredible ambitions for their games, and we want to ensure that you receive the best, most polished versions of them.

                              <span>Lego Brawls, a minifigure fighting game previously launched on Apple Arcade, is set to relaunch this summer on consoles. 


The Smash Bros-style fighter will arrive on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, published by Bandai Namco. 


The idea here is to battle - solo or with up to eight players (four on PlayStation) - and collect minifigures which you can then customise to create your own hero of choice. You can then take said hero and attempt to tackle the game&#x27;s global leaderboards.

The group, part of contracted game services company Keywords Studios, were recently told they would need to begin working in BioWare&#x27;s offices full-time from this week. This sparked calls of unfairness from Keywords staff, who compared their lot to BioWare&#x27;s own staff - who are allowed a hybrid work from home option. 


Keywords workers have now been told they can continue to work from home &quot;until further notice&quot;, The Verge reported.

As spotted by Kotaku, at least two players who were streaming the game were put into jail by moderators.


It follows a lengthy blog post from game director and producer Naoki Yoshida earlier this week, stating that players caught using third-party tools would be reprimanded.

The Japanese publisher had a record revenue of 299.5bn yen last financial year, an increase of almost 10 percent (9.9). Operating profit was a record 74.4bn yen.


The vast majority of that revenue came from the Digital Entertainment sector: 215bn yen. But without Metal Gear or Silent Hill, Konami has barely released any games, right?

                              <span>We already knew Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla was doing well - but it&#x27;s still doing well now, 18 months later.


New data released by Ubisoft last night as part of its annual financial results revealed Valhalla had more unique players in the past 12 months ending 31st March 2022 than it did in the four months after its hugely-successful launch. 


The stat suggests players are still picking up - and sticking with - Valhalla. Indeed, Ubisoft also said that the past year - free from a new Assassin&#x27;s Creed release - notched up nearly double the money than the year after 2018&#x27;s Odyssey arrived. That points to stronger sales of Valhalla&#x27;s DLC than Odyssey&#x27;s, too.

According to a press release, the game has entered the alpha stage of development with a limited number of players testing it out, directly invited by Activision.

                              <span>Valve has released patch notes for the Steam Deck&#x27;s latest update, which include the very welcome addition of game-specific performance settings.
To access this new feature, users must simply hop into their deck&#x27;s &#x27;quick access menu&#x27;, and then select the &#x27;performance&#x27; option. From here, click into &#x27;advanced view&#x27;.
When the per game settings are then toggled to the &#x27;on&#x27; option, a &quot;profile for the currently running title is created.&quot; Once you have edited the settings in this profile to your liking, they will be saved and applied automatically when you launch said game.

                              <span>A video said to showcase gameplay footage from a new Tencent-developed Need for Speed mobile game has leaked online.


Need for Speed Mobile, as per a series of job listings spotted earlier this year, currently appears to be in development at Tencent&#x27;s Timi Studio, which has also worked on the enormously popular Call of Duty Mobile and Pokémon Unite.


EA is yet to officially unveil a new Need for Speed mobile project, however, meaning the leaked footage - shared on the Need for Speed subreddit earlier today - is the first opportunity many will have had to see the game in action.

                              <span>Following a report last month that Ubisoft had attracted early takeover interest from several private equity firms, the Assassin&#x27;s Creed publisher has once again addressed the issue, saying it has &quot;everything we need to remain independent.&quot;


Ubisoft initially discussed the subject of buyouts back in February, following a round of acquisitions that saw Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, Sony buying Bungie, and Take-Two buying Zynga. Since then, however, a report from Bloomberg claimed Ubisoft had attracted preliminary interest from a number of private equity firms, although it was said the publisher had yet to enter into &quot;serious negotiations&quot; regarding such a deal.


In light of those reports, Ubisoft has once again addressed the subject of acquisitions, albeit in very much the same terms it did back in February. &quot;There&#x27;ve been a lot of talks around consolidation in the industry, and in Ubisoft in particular,&quot; company chairman Yves Guillemont said during the publisher&#x27;s latest earnings call, adding that its &quot;overall position is clear.&quot;

Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate ship battler - a spin-off from 2013 Assassin&#x27;s Creed game Black Flag - has been repeatedly delayed, though test footage leaked late last month suggested a launch was now finally on the horizon. Today, Ubisoft reconfirmed it would indeed see the light of day this financial year (before 1st April 2023). 


Also up this year, finally, is Ubisoft&#x27;s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Developed by The Division studio Massive Entertainment, it was first announced more than five years ago.

Well, they have done it again, and this time discovered the zebra that Abby and her father take care of in Salt Lake City is actually invincible (for which I am quite relieved - this game has enough bloodshed as it is).
In the second episode of Speclizer&#x27;s myth busting series, the creator used a series of gunshots and explosives to see if the zebra would meet its demise. However, that lady is a hardy one, and if anything, she only looks mildly disgruntled as the bomb blasts go off around her (which, you know, seems fair).
Another amusing discovery comes from the snowy streets of Jackson. This time, it is Ellie in the control seat, and she is pissed at the community&#x27;s annoying kids for trying to best her in a snowball fight. However, no matter how far Ellie goes from that play area, she will still be hit over and over again by the white stuff. In the words of Speclizer, &quot;the kids have aimbot&quot;.

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t long ago that developer Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s confirmed its free-to-play battle royale shooter Apex Legends would finally be making its debut on mobile devices this May - and now the developer has gone one better, confirming it&#x27;ll be heading to iOS and Android next Tuesday, 17th May.


Apex Legends&#x27; move to mobile was made official last April, when Respawn confirmed it would be a completely separate entity to its console and PC counterparts, meaning players should expect unique battle passes, even mobile-only maps and gameplay - although no cross-play. It also promises to tailor the experience specifically for mobile devices with the likes of streamlined controls for touchscreens.


Apex Legends Mobile has been available to select players for some time now, having entered regional testing earlier this year, but Respawn has now confirmed its ready to roll out the experience globally, with its full iOS and Android launch now set for next Tuesday, 17th May.

                              <span>Mini Motorways, the acclaimed road-building strategy sim from developer Dinosaur Polo Club, has made the leap to Switch and will be available via the console&#x27;s eShop from today, 11th May.


As you might have already twigged, Mini Motorways is the follow-up to Dinosaur Polo Club&#x27;s celebrated underground railway builder Mini Metro, and delivers an equally minimalist, equally excellent, spin on its predecessor&#x27;s tactile strategy action.


In Mini Motorways, each level takes loose inspiration from a real-world city, and the goal is to construct as efficient a road network as possible, placing down the likes of traffic lights, bridges, and roads to ensure commuters are able to reach their destination within the allotted time. New building items are awarded each in-game week, enabling your urban expansion to continue unfettered - until you make a mistake and your best laid plans end in chaos.

What we did get was a look at more than a dozen promising indie titles headed to Nintendo Switch over the next year, some of which were new reveals, while others popped up with new release windows. Oh, and a couple are out today!


The showcase kicked off with creature collection and farming game Ooblets, which is getting a Nintendo Switch release this summer. It previously launched via Early Access on PC and Xbox.

It&#x27;s being developed as a collaboration between Deadpan Games&#x27; Will Lewis (maker of Steam and Switch roguelike Caveblazers) and artist Gaziter.

Speaking to The New York Times, EA boss Andrew Wilson said a lot of the company&#x27;s motivation was to improve players&#x27; experiences without being pigeonholed.
&quot;It was really about how can we do more for the players, more for the fans, how can we offer them more modalities to play,&quot; he said. &quot;How can we bring more partners into the game, how can we expand beyond the bounds of the traditional game.&quot;

                              <span>BioWare has swiftly shut down internet speculation it had inadvertantly teased a return for franchise hero Commander Shepard in the next Mass Effect.


Yesterday, fan gossip was sparked by the description of a poster on the BioWare store. The poster is a print of the teaser image BioWare released last November for its in-development Mass Effect game, and was described thus: &quot;While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what&#x27;s next.&quot;


This description (which was later corrected to remove Shepard&#x27;s name) was enough to spark YouTube videos, as well as articles from various blogs and websites. And, of course, the fire was only fuelled further by BioWare&#x27;s later correction.

                              <span>Capcom has had yet another great year of sales, and as such made some pretty tidy profits. 
The company released its financial report earlier today and announced its &quot;fifth consecutive year of record-high profits&quot;, although this is actually its ninth consecutive year of seeing some kind of profit growth. Capcom stated these profits have been driven by its digital contents business (so, hey there Resident Evil and Monster Hunter).
&quot;Net sales were 110bn yen (up 15.5 percent from the previous fiscal year), operating income was 42bn yen (up 24 percent), ordinary income was 44bn yen (up 27.2 percent), and net income attributable to owners of the parent was 32,553m yen (up 30.6 percent),&quot; Capcom said.

The other three mystery titles include a &quot;remake&quot;, a &quot;sports title, and a &quot;partner title&quot; - likely meaning one of the various studios EA publishes games for, such as It Takes Two&#x27;s Hazelight.


Alongside those, EA also has its upcoming (and final) FIFA game and Madden NFL 23 set for this autumn, before NHL 23 and the long-awaited Need for Speed turn up before Christmas. So, what could those mystery games be?

The announcement stated the committee would assist Ubisoft with &quot;major strategic orientations to achieve a strong, sustainable and inclusive growth&quot; and would &quot;accelerate its transformation&quot; (thanks GamesIndustry.biz).


De Waubert was previously managing director of Ubisoft Paris and will now report directly to CEO Yves Guillemot and lead all Ubisoft studios worldwide.

&quot;I will refrain from making comments on the competitors&#x27; strategy,&quot; PlayStation exec Hiroki Totoki told investors during the company&#x27;s latest financial call). &quot;Our current thinking is to have development costs [and] appropriate R&amp;D investment for quality products, and that will improve the platform and also improve the business in the long run.
&quot;AAA type titles on PS5, if we distribute that on the subscription services, we may need to shrink the investment needed for that and that will deteriorate the first-party title quality and that is our concern.&quot;

Speaking to investors last night, EA boss Andrew Wilson said the publisher was taking &quot;the long view&quot; when it came to the franchise, and that it would remain a big part of EA for the forseeable future.


Wilson praised former Respawn boss Vince Zampella in his new expanded role in which he also oversees some Battlefield development, and also promised EA would continue to &quot;grow&quot; Battlefield 2042 - after righting its ship first.

The new figure was revealed in publisher Bandai Namco&#x27;s earnings report that takes us up to the end of March, meaning global sales will have exceeded that 13.4m.

                              <span>Georgetown has a new report on the highly secretive bulk surveillance activities of ICE in the US:
When you think about government surveillance in the United States, you likely think of the National Security Agency or the FBI. You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don’t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has — without any judicial, legislative or public oversight — reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</span>
