                              <span>EA has announced FIFA 22 will be joining its EA Play subscription service, as well as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, next Thursday, 23rd June.


FIFA 22, if you haven&#x27;t been keeping track, brought some solid improvements to the long-running football series when it launched last year, but its wins were, once again, overshadowed by what Eurogamer&#x27;s Wesley Yin-Poole called its &quot;morally bankrupt monetisation&quot; in his review.


&quot;I play a lot of FIFA, and with good reason,&quot; Wes wrote. &quot;I enjoy it, in a grumpy sort of way. Reporting on all the good, bad and ugly FIFA has to offer has been a fascinating part of my job over the last decade. If you&#x27;re only in it for Career Mode, for example, FIFA 22 is a good shout. If you only play Volta (there must be someone!) then there&#x27;s nothing particularly offensive about the game. But context is king. Ultimate Team cannot be ignored.&quot;

                              <span>A new report has claimed Sony is working on a &quot;pro&quot; controller for PlayStation 5 that it&#x27;s planning to officially unveil &quot;soon&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to the ever leaky Tom Henderson who, writing for Try Hard Guides (thanks VGC), claims to have seen images of a prototype from a source wishing to remain anonymous.


Henderson says the new controller retains the same basic style of the existing PlayStation 5 controller but features a number of key differences. These include &quot;removable stick units&quot; - which can be switched in and out using buttons below the analog sticks - plus trigger stops, a seemingly removal grip, and rear buttons that Henderson describes as &quot;flappy paddles&quot;, presumably similar to those seen on the likes of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.

                              <span>Following its long-awaited official unveiling last week, Naughty Dog has given another glimpse of its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for PS5 and PC, this time showcasing what it calls a &quot;glow up&quot; for supporting character Tess.


During last week&#x27;s Summer Game Fest reveal, one of key arguments Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann made for remaking the original Last of Us - a game that already got the remaster treatment in 2014 - was that the additional power of modern hardware would enable it to get closer to its &quot;original vision&quot;. The studio specifically highlighted the remake&#x27;s rebuilt character models and faces, which it said would better reflect the cast&#x27;s original performances.


Inevitably, the remake&#x27;s character changes have come as something of a shock to fans who&#x27;ve grown attached to the original versions over the last nine years, with both Joel and Ellie now sporting more realistic facial makeovers that age them notably. That&#x27;s especially true for Naughty Dog&#x27;s latest reveal, showcasing the new version of Joel&#x27;s friend Tess, who initially agrees to help smuggle Ellie out of the city.

                              <span>Wo Long development producer Masaaki Yamagiwa has commented on the difficulty level of Team Ninja&#x27;s new Soulslike, revealed at the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase.


Yamagiwa previously worked at Sony&#x27;s Japan Studio when it published Bloodborne, so understands the importance of balanced difficulty.


&quot;Difficult games shouldn&#x27;t be difficult just for the sake of it,&quot; Yamagiwa told IGN. &quot;I think it&#x27;s really important that this difficulty exists for the purpose of delivering a sense of accomplishment to the players once they have overcome it. That&#x27;s why I think players should always be able to blame themselves when they die. The game has to be fair and its difficulty should never be unreasonable. In that regard, it works in my favour that I&#x27;m not very good at games myself. I&#x27;ll always naturally be judging the fairness of games.&quot;

                              <span>PIXOMONDO, the VFX team behind the special effects for the first season of Paramount&#x27;s Halo TV adaptation, has released a new reel showing off its work behind the scenes.
Included in this reel are clips of Jen Taylor mocapping her character of Cortana, as well as the evolution of the series&#x27; many digital environments. Taylor has famously voiced the role of Cortana throughout the Halo games, making her inclusion in the show a pretty special one for fans.
It is an interesting watch and, for those in the UK, one of our best looks at the show yet. You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>Data miners have been busy scouring Elden Ring for cut content, from dream quests to those mysterious coliseums.


Now Sekiro Dubi has discovered a potential cut questline for Festering Fingerprint Vyke.


Who&#x27;s Vyke? Why, he&#x27;s the guy on the cover!

                              <span>We all know Elden Ring is a tricky game and its optional boss battle against Malenia is arguably the most difficult moment of the game.


But one streamer, Kwitty23, decided to beat the whole game playing as Malenia. Not only that, he only used one move the entire run: her iconic Waterfowl Dance.


Funniest of all was when Kwitty23 ended up fighting Malenia as Malenia and proceeded to destroy her first time. Turns out she&#x27;s pretty weak to her own attacks.

Senior concept artist Gervasio Canda has shared dozens of artworks over the past few years, which have garnered attention this week after fans began discussing one piece of art in particular. 


The following artwork is the only one in Canda&#x27;s collection to depict a landscape that has not (to date) appeared in Fortnite. Are we looking into the future of the game? Or, perhaps more likely, is this an area Epic Games ended up not using?

                              <span>Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions are bringing Gran Turismo to the big screen, with Neill Blomkamp listed as the film&#x27;s director. 
This adaptation, which is set to release on 11th August 2023, will focus on the story of one teenage Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills won them a series of Nissan competitions to become a professional race car driver. Deadline reports the screenplay has been written by Jason Hall.
If this all sounds familiar to you and you are getting a strong sense of déjà vu, well, you&#x27;re right to feel that way. After all, this is the same concept from the Gran Turismo film that never was.

At the time of this announcement, Capcom revealed those yet to experience the games will be able to purchase the newly updated Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions from their respective stores, but existing owners on Xbox One and PS4 would be able to grab the updates relevant to their platform at no additional cost.
However, it now transpires this is not the case for those who got their hands on Resident Evil 7 through the PlayStation Plus Collection (something that is exclusive to the PS5).
Instead, those who have been playing the game via the PS Plus Collection but also want to experience the game with its 4K resolution, &quot;high&quot; framerates, ray tracing, and 3D audio will need to purchase the game separately (via IGN).

                              <span>A new The Convergence mod is on the way for Elden Ring.


The Convergence Team - a group of three modders - created a celebrated mod for Dark Souls 3 that significantly altered the main game. It added new character classes, over 100 new spells, new rings, armours and weapons, new factions, and even new NPCs and bosses.


It looks like Elden Ring will be getting the same treatment.

That&#x27;s according to Yoshimi Yasuda, the game&#x27;s executive producer, who recently formed a fresh company to work on projects unknown. 


Does this mean a re-release, a remaster or a sequel to the original Lollipop Chainsaw, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this week? Yasuda declined to mention.

                              <span>Kid Kirby, originally planned for the SNES, is a cancelled Nintendo game we&#x27;ve previously known little of. Now, fresh details have come to light showing a little more of what could have been, had this project come to fruition. 
Details shared by the Kid Kirby Archive Twitter include manual pages, a story overview and new renders, all of which were provided by writer Steve Hammond.
First off, we have a render of King Dedede, a character only previously seen in much lower quality on a 1995 internal brochure.

                              <span>GSC Game World has provided a fresh update on its staff and the development of its upcoming project Stalker 2, amidst the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 


The video, below, is a tough and often extraordinary watch - but one which details how life has changed for the game&#x27;s team over the course of this year.


Many GSC staff have now fled Ukraine, though others have been unable to. Here, those still in the country show their current living conditions, describe the destruction around them, and in some cases speak from the war&#x27;s frontlines - where they have gone to fight for their country.

                              <span>An upcoming feature-length documentary called GoldenEra will give nostalgic fans like me a closer look at the making of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s iconic game GoldenEye 007. 
Within this documentary, viewers will &quot;learn how a young and inexperienced team at UK development studio Rare were handed the James Bond licence, before making a game that would change the medium forever when it was released&quot;. 
This includes insights from the original GoldenEye 007 team, as well as those within the press that covered the game on its release (all the way back in 1997!) and saw their careers change as a result. It will also touch base with the many fans who played the game 25 years ago and discuss the resulting impact it had on them.

At the time, the developer said this delay was to ensure it delivers &quot;the best possible experience&quot; to players on its eventual launch. However, it has now been revealed that, as with other games, this delay was also due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
&quot;We had a bit of a weird thing with the multiplayer because... part of our team is based out in the Ukraine... So, we had to delay the multiplayer because they had to move,&quot; The Quarry creative director Will Byles told IGN.
&quot;We had to move the server from Kyiv up into Warsaw and those guys had to get out [of] there because it was obviously really dangerous.&quot;

The project, an all-new Fire Emblem RPG in the works for Nintendo Switch, was discussed yesterday by Nintendo leaker Emily Rogers. Shortly after, screenshots purportedly showing an early version of the game were posted on reddit. 

Eurogamer understands the project is real. We&#x27;ve contacted Nintendo for more.

Todd Howard, the game&#x27;s director, spoke to IGN and offered further details on the game - including the length of its main quest. 



However, when asked whether players can fly seamlessly to space, Howard said the feature is &quot;really just not that important to the player&quot; to justify the extra engineering work required.

                              <span>This is a new vulnerability against Apple’s M1 chip. Researchers say that it is unpatchable.
Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, however, have created a novel hardware attack, which combines memory corruption and speculative execution attacks to sidestep the security feature. The attack shows that pointer authentication can be defeated without leaving a trace, and as it utilizes a hardware mechanism, no software patch can fix it.
The attack, appropriately called “Pacman,” works by “guessing” a pointer authentication code (PAC), a cryptographic signature that confirms that an app hasn’t been maliciously altered. This is done using speculative execution—a technique used by modern computer processors to speed up performance by speculatively guessing various lines of computation—to leak PAC verification results, while a hardware side-channel reveals whether or not the guess was correct...</span>

                              <span>A new report by UK consumer watchdog Which? has claimed two in five Joy-Con controllers from the original version of the Switch are affected by persistent drift.


Switch has faced widespread complaints around Joy-Con controller drift since its launch in 2017, leading to class action lawsuits, and even EU calls for an investigation into the issue after it received more than 25,000 complaints from numerous countries. Reports were significant enough that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologised for the issue in 2020, which it&#x27;s since claimed to have &quot;improved&quot;.


More recently, a Kotaku report claimed Nintendo of America recieved &quot;thousands&quot; of faulty Joy-Cons each week at height of drift issues, and now UK consumer watchdog Which? has shared its own findings into the severity of the problem, claiming two in five (40 percent) of Joy-Con controllers from the original Switch are affected.

                              <span>When last we heard of Fallout 5, it was little more than a &quot;one-pager&quot; idea at Bethesda that may or may not come to fruition; however, studio director Todd Howard has now confirmed a new mainline entry in the beloved Fallout series is definitely happening, but won&#x27;t release until after The Elder Scrolls 6.


In conversation with IGN, Howard revealed The Elder Scrolls 6 is currently in pre-production (confirming previous rumours around the project&#x27;s progress), before adding, &quot;And, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate&#x27;s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.&quot;


In other words, with Bethesda&#x27;s next big title, sci-fi RPG Starfield, delayed until next year, and still no word on a potential release window for The Elder Scrolls 6 - despite the game having received its first official tease back in 2018 - it sounds like there&#x27;ll be an extremely long wait until Fallout 5 finally sees the light of day.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard - which continues its attempts to reassert itself following many months of shocking allegations it fostered a company culture where sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive - has confirmed Overwatch 2&#x27;s second closed beta will launch for PC and consoles on 28th June.


Blizzard first announced its intention to &quot;decouple&quot; Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvP and PvE modes and begin a series of multiplayer-focused betas back in March, and the first of these took place in April. That initial run gave participants a first look at Overwatch 2&#x27;s 5v5 gameplay, Push mode, four new maps, new hero Sojourn, and reworkings of Orisa, Doomfist, Bastion, and Sombra.


Round two, announced earlier today on Twitter, will shake things up a little further, giving players access to new tank hero Junker Queen and a new map. Blizzard is saving further details for a livestream airing this Thursday, 16th June, at 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PT, and says it&#x27;ll be discussing the game&#x27;s live-service model and seasonal content plan at the same time.

Asobo first targeted the US for a bit of a visual makeover in its second-ever World Update back in November 2020, introducing a significant number of improvements to the United States&#x27; multitudinous geological and man-made landmarks.
At the time, it said that the sheer size of the US meant it would eventually be revisiting the area, and now, seven World Updates later, that day has come.

                              <span>Over the weekend, Microsoft shared a list of 50 new titles heading to Game Pass over the next 12 months, and it&#x27;s now given a little more detail on one of those games - developer Iron Gate Studio&#x27;s acclaimed viking survival hit Valheim - confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for PC Game Pass this autumn with an Xbox release next spring.


Valheim, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched into Steam early access last February, and its refined viking survival action - which sees players exploring a gorgeous open-world, slowly preparing themselves to battle powerful creatures and prove themselves worthy of entering Valhalla - immediately drew critical acclaim.


It was also a massive sales hit too, managing to sell a staggering 4m copies in only three weeks. One year on, it&#x27;s shifted over 10 million copies on PC, and development continues apace, with work on its highly anticipated Mistlands update said to be &quot;well underway&quot;.

Fans can look forward to seeing &quot;the last episode of the story of Eivor&quot; via a final free chapter - which will presumably tell the story of how our Norse heroine came to rest in Vinland. 


Before then, there&#x27;s a new Niflheim-set roguelite game mode named The Forgotten Saga coming this summer, and a final set of challenge vaults coming this autumn to conclude the game&#x27;s Tombs of the Fallen mystery. And, of course, there&#x27;s the game&#x27;s seasonal festivals. All of this content comes for free.

Louarn, a French citizen, meanwhile lives in Avignon and was recently interviewed by Le Monde (paywall), via TorrentFreak.


&quot;I was&#x27;t going to end up as an engineer earning €5k a month when I realized, at 18, that hacking was not just fun, but that there was a way to make a lot of money,&quot; Louarn says, of how he got into the hacking game. &quot;Stealing from companies that make billions, what do I care?&quot;

                              <span>Tekken 2 was accidentally priced at almost $10k on the PSN store, catching the attention of Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada.


The PS1 classic fighter has been added to the store as part of the PS Plus subscription, but as Twitter user TheKBGamer spotted the game was incorrectly listed as costing $9999.


Harada shared the tweet joking &quot;what a marvellous price Sony&quot;. Presumably he would&#x27;ve Tekken quite the bonus at that price.

A trailer for the crossover - a spoof of the Halo 3 &quot;Believe&quot; campaign - confirms a release date of 30th June. That&#x27;s a week after the game finally hits Xbox as a free-to-play game.



The event will seemingly last until 4th July and be available across all platforms: Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch.

The event, dubbed a &quot;Celebration Livestream&quot;, is yet another livestream in this never-ending not-E3 several week period - during which Ubisoft itself has kept noticeably quiet.


But what should we really expect tonight? It&#x27;s perhaps worth keeping expectations in check.

This leak suggests the remake is real, although a PSN listing that&#x27;s since been removed (thanks Escapist) offers no gameplay or release date details.

                              <span>Capcom has amended its minimum requirements on PC for the newly upgraded Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7.



The free upgrades, released after the Capcom showcase, are across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and include ray-tracing, 4K support, higher framerates, and 3D audio.



However, the minimum requirements on PC have been raised and Capcom notes that &quot;once the upgrade patch has been applied, the game cannot be restored to the previous version even if the game is uninstalled.&quot;

                              <span>Capcom has played down reports that long-running Street Fighter character Fei Long can no longer appear in the famous fighting game franchise due to a clash with the Bruce Lee estate.


Fei Long, originally created for 1993&#x27;s Super Street Fighter 2 as one of four new challengers, is heavily-inspired by real-life movie martial arts legend Bruce Lee.


Last month, Street Fighter 5 composer Daniel Lindholm suggested Fei Long may no longer feature in the series because the Lee Bruce estate insists depictions of the Enter the Dragon star must be &quot;honourable&quot;, rather than humourous in the wake of the &quot;comedy&quot; cameo in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

                              <span>Interesting vulnerability in Tesla’s NFC key cards:
Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, quickly noticed something odd about the new feature: Not only did it allow the car to automatically start within 130 seconds of being unlocked with the NFC card, but it also put the car in a state to accept entirely new keys­with no authentication required and zero indication given by the in-car display.
“The authorization given in the 130-second interval is too general… [it’s] not only for drive,” Herfurt said in an online interview. “This timer has been introduced by Tesla… in order to make the use of the NFC card as a primary means of using the car more convenient. What should happen is that the car can be started and driven without the user having to use the key card a second time. The problem: within the 130-second period, not only the driving of the car is authorized, but also the [enrolling] of a new key.”...</span>

                              <span>We knew they were coming, but Capcom has announced its PS5 and Xbox Series X/S spruce-ups of Resident Evil 2, 3 and 7 will launch today, 13th June.


All three titles - which is to say, the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes, plus Resident Evil 7 - will feature support for 4K resolution, &quot;high&quot; framerates, ray tracing, and 3D audio.


Players yet to experience the games will be able to purchase the newly updated Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions from their respective stores, but existing owners on Xbox One and PS4 can grab the updates relevant to their platform at no additional cost. Saves will also transfer.

She&#x27;ll feature in the arcade-style The Mercenaries: Additional Orders mode, as well as Chris Redfield and Karl Heisenberg. Mind your head though - you&#x27;ll need to duck down through doorways as you slash enemies from nine feet above.


The Mercenaries mode is one of three major additions in this Winter&#x27;s Expansion DLC, due out on 28th October this year.

The new demo will give players the opportunity to explore Sunbreak&#x27;s newly revealed jungle locale, a twist on the area first encountered in 2006&#x27;s Monster Hunter 2, complete with new elements and endemic life. Here they can test their mettle against flying wyvern Astalos (from Monster Hunter Generations), a Great Izuchi, a Tetranadon, plus an especially challenging version of Sunbreak&#x27;s flagship monster Malzeno.


It&#x27;ll also let players try out Sunbreak&#x27;s new Switch Skill Swap system, new Silkbind attacks, and a variety of handy tutorials.

                              <span>Bethesda has slapped a new release window on Fallout 76&#x27;s previously announced The Pitt expansion, confirming the Fallout-3-inspired update will arrive some time this September.


Fallout 76&#x27;s The Pitt expansion was annouced for a 2022 release last June, and its arrival date was narrowed down a little further, specifically to this &quot;autumn&quot;, as part of February&#x27;s 2022 roadmap. Last night&#x27;s Xbox showcase, though, saw it inching even closer to receiving a proper release date, with its new gameplay trailer heralding a September launch.


The Pitt - inspired by the second add-on released for 2008&#x27;s much-loved Fallout 3 - will arrive as part of Fallout 76&#x27;s Season 10 update in September, and marks the first time players will be able to travel beyond the boundaries of Appalachia in the online game.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s big Starfield gameplay reveal, Bethesda has re-emerged with a few additional details regarding its highly anticipated sci-fi RPG, confirming that dialogue scenes will be presented in first-person throughout, and that the main character won&#x27;t be voiced.


If you&#x27;re only familiar with Bethesda games prior to Fallout 4, that probably won&#x27;t seem like all that big a deal, given that mute protagonists and lengthy first-person conversations with dead-eyed NPCs were par for the course in Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, and Oblivion.


It&#x27;s really only notable when you factor in Fallout 4; here, Bethesda opted for a slightly more cinematic approach to its story telling, switching to third-person perspective during dialogue scenes and introducing a fully voiced protagonist - the latter drawing complaints from fans that felt the decision had forced the developer to limit the breadth and depth of conversation options compared to those seen in previous games.

                              <span>Yesterday, Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4, the game that&#x27;s not Diablo Immoral (sorry, I meant Immortal), will launch for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S next year. Since this news came to light, some have been voicing concerns that Diablo 4 may go down the same route as Diablo Immortal and have some kind of mobile-like monetisation and microtransactions attached to it. 
In response, several of its developers have swiftly jumped in to try and quell any anxiety within the Diablo community.
&quot;To be clear, [Diablo 4] is a full price game built for PC/PS/Xbox audiences,&quot; franchise exec Rod Fergusson tweeted yesterday.

This includes dozens more games for the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium&#x27;s game catalogue of PS4 and PS5 titles, such as: Dead Cells, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Frostpunk: Console Edition, John Wick Hex, Little Nightmares, Nioh, Prey, Shenmue 3, Soulcalibur 6, Surgeon Simulator, Telling Lies, Tropico 5, Trine 4, plus The Dark Pictures Anthology&#x27;s Little Hope and Man of Medan. 


The list of games available in the US looks to be a large upgrade from the list of games available in Hong Kong, for example. But there are some games (Journey to the Savage Planet) listed as available in Asia but not in the US.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 was the highlight of last week&#x27;s not-E3, with playable booths at Summer Game Fest drawing the biggest crowds while the developers were on-hand to answer questions and outline specifics of the return of Capcom&#x27;s beloved series. Well, they&#x27;ve been answering some questions, while some other areas still remain bizarrely unclear. 


Crossplay has been a hope for the game since its reveal - something supported on Street Fighter 5 across PC and PlayStation, with Street Fighter 6 promising to bring Xbox players into the fold - and early reports from showgoers including fighting game YouTuber Maximillian Dood seemingly confirmed it would be included.


When pushed for clarity on the issue, however, Capcom was unwilling to confirm the matter. &quot;In terms of crossplay we&#x27;re going to have more information and more specifics to share down the line,&quot; a Capcom representative told Eurogamer at Summer Game Fest. &quot;It&#x27;s something we feel strongly about but in terms of actual specifics that will come at a later time.&quot;

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper, the acclaimed indie game from In Other Waters developer Jump Over the Age, is getting a bunch of free DLC episodes.


Three extra dollops of story will arrive &quot;throughout 2022 and into 2023&quot;, and build on the game&#x27;s existing lore with fresh characters and quests. 


The first of these, Flux, will drop in July and detail the arrival of a refugee flotilla to Erlin&#x27;s Eye. It&#x27;s a plotline that will continue in October with a second free DLC release, then conclude sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Kojima Productions has issued a statement to fans addressing its future with Sony, following yesterday&#x27;s confirmation that Hideo Kojima was now working on a project for Xbox.


Of course, Kojima most recently partnered with PlayStation for Death Stranding - and fans of that game are now expecting a Death Stranding sequel, thanks to the loose lips of actor and star Norman Reedus. 


Kojima&#x27;s partnership with Sony was a major coup for PlayStation, and was announced with glee by its then-head Andy House. Kojima&#x27;s appearance on last night&#x27;s Microsoft and Bethesda Showcase, introduced by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, held similar vibes.

This news did not come with an official statement or announcement. Rather, following Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s showcase last night, Xbox released a tweet detailing all its upcoming games for the next 12 months. 
As you can see below, this image shows Stalker 2 on the right-hand side, which denotes the games releasing in the first half of 2023.

                              <span>ENCSecurity markets a file encryption system, and it’s used by SanDisk, Sony, Lexar, and probably others. Despite it using AES as its algorithm, it’s implementation is flawed in multiple ways—and breakable.
The moral is, as it always is, that implementing cryptography securely is hard. Don’t roll your own anything if you can help it.</span>

                              <span>We may not have got the James Bond Goldeneye announcement that we were all expecting at Microsoft and Bethesda’s showcase earlier this evening, but we did get another look at something pretty damn close to it at the PC Gaming Show – Replicant D6’s Agent 64: Spies Never Die. And not only did we get to see some more of this glorious gameplay in motion, we also got the news that its demo is now available to download on Steam.
The full game is slated to release sometime this year, although at the time of writing no further specifics were given.
Agent 64: Spies Never Die is all very James Bond GoldenEye a la the Nintendo 64 era, from the music and the weapons to the settings. There is even footage of the shooter - I assume the titular Agent 64 - finishing someone off in a toilet stall. Small me is very happy to see this and will most likely be heading to Steam to download the demo once I have finished work for the evening. You can check out the new trailer for yourself below.

                              <span>Last May, developer Ion Lands got fans of its gorgeous Blade-Runner-esque delivery thriller Cloudpunk a little bit giddy with the announcement of new life-sim spin-off Nivalis, and now, a little over a year on, the developer has given a first look at the game in action.


Cloudpunk, which released back in 2020, was an experience I enjoyed a lot after it received a number of much-needed post-launch nips and tucks, revelling in the chance to play out all my Blade Runner fantasies by careening around its stunningly designed, neon-drenched futuristic city of Nivalis in my trusty flying car.


The biggest disappointment was that Nivalis proved to be rather lifeless at ground level, which is where Cloudpunk&#x27;s spin-off comes in, attempting to turn the city from a pretty backdrop into a rich, meaningful world of its own as you attempt to build a business up from scratch.

That date was revealed this evening during a fresh trailer for Immortality, shown during this year&#x27;s PC Gaming Show. As previously announced, the title will launch on Xbox directly into Game Pass.


Immortality is an investigative horror game where you sift through footage from three (fictional) classic films which starred the (also fictional) actress Marissa Marcel, in order to discover her fate.

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind the acclaimed likes of Frostpunk and This War of Mine, has unveiled its latest project, sci-fi survival adventure The Alters.


Unfortunately, it&#x27;s early days as far as specifics go, with the bulk of 11 Bit&#x27;s reveal taking the form of a cinematic trailer - one immediately bringing Duncan Jones&#x27; celebrated sci-fi movie Moon to mind. You see, in The Alters, players take on the role of Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant planet, ensconced in a roving wheel-like base, with a bunch of alternative versions of himself known as Alters. Ultimately, the goal is to stay alive long enough to find a way back home by creating new Alters, each of who have different skills essential for survival.


&quot;The Alters is a game about life-changing moments,&quot; explains The Alters&#x27; new Steam page. &quot;Those binary decisions that happen in nanoseconds, but have influence over your entire life. It is about looking into yourself, into your past, and discovering that you are who you are as a sum of those numerous choices. And when you do that a fundamental question arises: WHAT IF...?&quot;.

Specifically, it&#x27;s being led by producers Fumihiko Yasuda (of Nioh fame) and Masaaki Yamagiwa (Bloodborne). 


Set in the Later Han Dynasty - or a version of it where demons exist - you play as a nameless soldier skilled in Chinese martial arts. Here&#x27;s a first trailer - what do you think?

                              <span>It&#x27;s taken over four years of concerted pleading, but Sea of Thieves players will finally be able to name their own ships from July, when the multiplayer pirate adventures very-long-awaited Captaincy Update arrives as part of Season Seven.


First discussed prior to Sea of Thieves&#x27; launch, the Captaincy Update was originally set to be one of the game&#x27;s first post-launch updates, giving Pirate Legends the ability create their own legendary ship and forge a fearsome identity for themselves on the waves. They&#x27;d also start each session within the Legendary Hideout, blasting through its waterfall to make a grand entrance on the main map.


Unfortunately, following Sea of Thieves&#x27; rocky launch, Rare announced it would be placing the Captaincy update &quot;on the back burner&quot; while it refocussed its development. Since then, the Captaincy update has become the stuff of legends itself, many assuming it was lost to time.

                              <span>If you like mournfully hopping around a mysterious world as a little person solving puzzles, you might like the sound of Cocoon: it&#x27;s a deeply handsome puzzle-platforming indie from Jeppe Carlsen, the gameplay designer of Limbo and Inside.
You play as a kind of fly-person, who carries various glowing spheres around various exotic worlds. It&#x27;s wonderfully moody, the opening desert hinting at some Sable-like vibes before we move on to a range of other ones, &quot;worlds within worlds&quot; as the blurb puts it. Even from just the trailer you get the sense there&#x27;s some real cleverness to the puzzle-platforming to go with it.
Looks good! You can &quot;unravel a cosmic mystery&quot; in it next year, as it&#x27;s coming 2023, like an awful lot of games it seems, on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass.

                              <span>Starfield&#x27;s delay was some of the biggest news to come this year, but alas not a surprise. After all, we had only been shown concept art with every teaser so far. Thankfully though, we now have our first look at some actual gameplay.
The gameplay starts off on the mysterious moon of Kreet and sees robot companion VASCO making his way out of the starship. Then, of course, we see some aliens, other space things and some combat. All the while, the swelling score is ticking along nicely in the background. We also pop over to New Atlantis at one point.
But you&#x27;re not here to listen to me waffling on. You&#x27;re here to see it for yourself. So, without further ado, here is our first look at gameplay for Starfield.

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Showcase brought confirmation of Microsoft&#x27;s new partnership with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima. 


Details were thin on the ground - really, there was nothing here which had not been reported already - but tonight Microsoft made it official. 


Kojima is working on a brand new project with Xbox which will harness the company&#x27;s cloud technology. If this sounds familiar, well, it&#x27;s a promise we&#x27;ve heard before, and a detail which first found its way online last summer, when whispers of Kojima working with Microsoft first hit the internet.

                              <span>We didn&#x27;t see this one coming: renowned role-playing game developer Obsidian is releasing a brand new game called Pentiment this November on Xbox consoles, PC and the cloud.
It&#x27;s a narrative-focused murder mystery set in medieval times, and the action takes place on the pages of an era-appropriate book. It certainly looks different to everything else out there.
The game is led by Obsidian star director Josh Sawyer (Fallout: new Vegas, Pillars of Eternity) and is apparently an idea he pitched years and years ago at Black Isle Studios, according to IGN, which interviewed Sawyer about his new game.

Grounded has been available in early access for PC and Xbox since July 2020, miniaturising players - in true Honey, I Shrunk the Kids fashion - down to bug height and sending them off on an 80s-themed survival adventure through an ordinary backyard.


There&#x27;s building, crafting, spiders the size of trucks (at least from your miniaturised perspective), and a whole lot more to experience as you - along with a couple of friends if you like - fight to find a way to return to human size.

                              <span>Ara: History Untold was revealed during the Xbox and Bethesda Games showcase today, with scant detail beyond a cinematic trailer and a website.
It&#x27;s a turn-based grand strategy game, from Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games, and the angle seems to be: Civilization, but with an emphasis on alternate history.
Think snow-capped Pyramids, steampunk future-cities, and blimps, of course, because who doesn&#x27;t love a good blimp.

                              <span>Minecraft maker Mojang has revealed a new action strategy spin-off for its sandbox franchise: Minecraft Legends, developed with Blackbird Interactive. 


Described as an action strategy game, this 2023 release sees you run about slashing away at Minecraft enemies in a bid to unite Minecraft&#x27;s overworld, whatever that means. 


Still, it looks intriguing and if it&#x27;s half as fun as Mojang&#x27;s Minecraft Dungeons, will be worth a try. As you&#x27;d expect, it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and will launch for PC via Windows Store and Steam, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

                              <span>Microsoft showed a new trailer for A Plage Tale: Requiem during the Games Showcase today, giving us another rare look at gameplay in the upcoming sequel, due sometime this year on Xbox Consoles, PC and Game Pass at launch. It&#x27;s also coming to PS5 but obviously Microsoft glossed over that bit.
The thing that really stuck out to me, a fan of the first game, was stabbing. Amicia, the returning older sister of brother Hugo, and our hero, can now approach enemies from the back and stealth-kill them, reaching over and stabbing them multiple times in the neck - the kind of gruesome move we&#x27;ve seen many times in other stealth combat games. Except A Plague Tale, the first game, wasn&#x27;t really a stealth combat game - it was more about running away and hiding and being smart. That&#x27;s what made it stand out. 
Amicia also packs a crossbow in the sequel, which she uses, and she can garrotte people with some chord. All she had in the first game was a slingshot, which wasn&#x27;t entirely capable of one-shot kills. It was more of a utility/distraction tool.

                              <span>Asobo&#x27;s ceaseless expansion of the wonderful Microsoft Flight Simulator continues onward, with tonight&#x27;s Xbox showcase some of the new additions arriving before the end of the year - including a significant 40th anniversary update scheduled for November, and, rather unexpectedly, Halo Infinite&#x27;s Pelican, which launches as a free update today.


Microsoft hasn&#x27;t revealed how the Pelican will fit into the overall Flight Simulator experience just yet, but you can get a gimpse of the ship in the trailer below. It&#x27;s a different story for the free 40th Anniversary Edition update, however, which has been detailed in significantly more detail.
Described as a &quot;comprehensive celebration of the franchise&quot;, it promises to pay tribute to the series&#x27; past as well as introduce new aircraft types. The latter additions include the long-awaited arrival of helicopters and gliders, brought to life with a new Fluid Dynamics Simulation.

                              <span>As part of Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s showcase this evening, the next Forza Motorsport was finally announced. And, we also now have an idea of when it will be zooming our way - spring 2023. On its release it will be coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC. As well as this, Forza Motorsport will also be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription service on day one.
Along with this announcement, Dan Greenawalt and the game&#x27;s director Chris Esaki popped in for a chat about their game. It&#x27;s the most technically advanced racing game ever apparently, so that&#x27;s exciting. We also got told about its dynamic time of day feature, the weather for each track and the inclusion of raytracing. This was all shown off with a clip from the fictional circuit known as Maple Valley.
The twosome also says there&#x27;s a 48x improvement in the accuracy of the simulation - but, as Martin has asked, what does that mean, and how does it feel? I guess we won&#x27;t find out for a while.

                              <span>It feels like there&#x27;s been an awful lot of horror at this year&#x27;s Game Fest thing in Los Angeles. Today Xbox got in on the act opening its showcase with a proper look at Redfall, the co-op shooter about blasting vampires and cultists.


Redfall&#x27;s the work of Arkane Austin, and today&#x27;s overview mixed up a bit of gameplay with a look at the playable characters. We start approaching a spooky church and then head up into the spire where vampires are leaping about. Shotguns and nice vampire-burning-up effects ensue, and then we&#x27;re off to learn a bit about the town.


The titular Redfall is an island community in Massachusets apparently, but now the whole place has gone to heck. Vampires have blocked out the sun, drained all the water, and cut the town off. (Wouldn&#x27;t draining the water do the opposite?) Expect spooky Americana, like a funfair and an old cinema which appears to have the wilderness growing inside. Expect Left 4 Dead-type action as you take on different enemy types.

Also producing is Jean Julien Baronnet, who worked on the Assassin&#x27;s Creed movie with Marla Studios, which reportedly &quot;specialises&quot; in video game adaptations.

                              <span>Almost exactly a year after its announcement, Netflix has offered a first tiny glimpse of its animated, French-Revolution-era Castlevania spin-off, revealing its name to be Nocturne.


Castlevania: Nocturne will follow the adventures of two characters that should be immediately familiar to fans of the video games - Richter Belmont (a distant descendant of original Netflix series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - with its vampiric action playing out against the backdrop of the French Revolution, circa 1792.


 Powerhouse, the studio behind Netflix&#x27;s original animated Castlevania series will once again be on animation duties for Nocturne, with Kevin Kolde serving as showrunner and Clive Bradley being credited as &quot;creator/writer&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been clamouring for the further televisual adventures of Cuphead and Mugman, Netflix has some good news; the streaming service has confirmed the animated series&#x27; second season will arrive 19th August.


Season one of The Cuphead Show was well-received when it launched earlier this year, proving to be a hugely enjoyable adaptation of Studio MDHR&#x27;s acclaimed run-and-gunner. Cuphead&#x27;s second season will, unsurprisingly, continues where its predecessor left often, featuring the further misadventures of Cuphead, Mugman, and friends on Inkwell Isle.
Season 2 will feature another 12 15-minute episodes, and a further 12 episodes will follow sometime after that, completing Netflix&#x27;s previously confirmed three-season, 36 episode run.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we&#x27;re digesting last night&#x27;s big Summer Game Fest show, and the start of this year&#x27;s not-E3 few weeks. How&#x27;s it all been so far? Well, the PlayStation State of Play was pretty good, actually.


As for Geoff Keighley&#x27;s show last night, well... there were plenty of announcements in last night&#x27;s showcase, though few genuine surprises. Here we share our favourites, rate the night overall, and provide our best impressions of the Clickers from The Last of Us. Joining me, as ever, are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.


Of course, this year has seen the traditional E3 model splintered further - and we&#x27;re still to see two platform holders take their turn in the spotlight. We&#x27;ll be back next week to break down the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase, plus  perhaps even a Nintendo Direct. Thanks for watching, and have a lovely weekend!

                              <span>PlayStation fans fearing a delay to God of War Ragnarök can breathe a sigh of relief. 


Despite widespread speculation, Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s highly-anticipated sequel is due to arrive this November, Bloomberg reported today.


Of course, there&#x27;s still time between then and now for things to change. And, reportedly, things already have - the game was once set for September, before being shuffled back internally by two months.

The news was confirmed by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski in a Sonic livestream.


&quot;While unfortunately we can&#x27;t use all the original sounds from the Sega Genesis version of the game, Jun Senoue has been working really hard to adapt the original music that was composed in 1993 for Sonic Origins,&quot; said Chrzanowski.

We also have a new teaser that gives us a sneak peak of what lies ahead (sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean to make that sound quite so ominous - it looks like a really nice variety of showings). You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>This month&#x27;s Pokémon Go Community Day is going to be an interesting one - and not least due to its choice of featured creature, the pseudo-Legendary Deino.


As well as the monthly event&#x27;s typical in-game bonuses and good chances at catching a Deino&#x27;s Shiny version, developer Niantic is also using the event to roll-out a couple of brand new features. 


In a twist, players will be able to extend the event&#x27;s three-hour runtime in their local area by raiding at gyms after the 11am-2pm window concludes. The raids will feature Deino&#x27;s evolved form Zweilous, and hatch from a new type of raid egg that can only be tackled by players in person (so, no remote raid passes!).

All five will be included from next year&#x27;s awards. That includes awards for songwriting, song for social change, and poetry.


The Grammy Awards, America&#x27;s most prestigious music award ceremony, aims to encapsulate all elements of the music industry, so the Best Score Soundtrack For Video Games And Other Interactive Media should fit in neatly.

Turner, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is a British designer who spent more than a decade at Pokémon maker Game Freak, and was one of its first Western employees. Now he&#x27;s formed his own indie studio, All Possible Futures. 


A trailer for The Plucky Squire shows its dinky hero scampering through pages of a picture book, before leaping out into the 3D world of its surroundings. Here it is:

It&#x27;s skateboarding with a twist, then, and features a truly unique art style. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Last night, Naughty Dog officially unveiled its The Last of Us Part 1 remake for the PS5, and confirmed it will also make its way to PC in the future. Ahead of this reveal, we also got our first look at the price - $70 - via a leak online. That in itself was enough to cause many to raise an eyebrow, as while the game certainly does look smoother thanks to its current gen make-over, it is also a game that has been released twice before.
Today, we now have even more information on this release, such as the three editions that will be released. And I am sorry to say this folks, but that £70/$70 will only get you the base game and its prequel Left Behind. If you want to get your hands on the The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s  Digital Deluxe edition, you are going to have to part ways with £80/$80. Meanwhile, if you are looking to purchase The Last of Us Part I Firefly Edition, which is only available to buy as an exclusive directly from PlayStation in the US, you are looking at just shy of $100.
So, what exactly do you get with these editions to make them worth the money?

This will, presumably, put the show in direct competition with E3 - which has also announced a plan to return next year digitally and in-person.


Keighley, of course, previously worked on programming at E3 before the two went separate ways. And while the physical E3 event has been cancelled the past two years, Summer Game Fest has been angled as something of a replacement.

Indeed, those that stuck around once Keighley had done his thing this evening would have immediately been greeted by a slew of intriguing new indie titles, courtesy of this year&#x27;s Day of the Devs showcase - and if you missed it, the whole thing can be perused in one convenient, easily digestible round-up below. 

Time Flies


Time Flies is the work of Michael Frei and Mario von Rickenbach, the developers behind the acclaimed Kids, and explores the limited time we have on Earth from the perspective of a fly. After entering your location, you&#x27;re allotted a set amount of time (based on your country&#x27;s average life expectancy) to explore the inside of a house and puzzle out ways to complete a bucket list of activities, ranging from getting rich to making a friend. Time Flies is coming to Playstation, Switch, PC, and Mac next year.

                              <span>Oi, guv! There&#x27;s a cracking, cockney, knees-up of a trailer for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide here that shows off some gameplay in the most detail yet. Take a look:
For the curious, Darktide is a spiritual follow-up to Fatshark&#x27;s previous four-player co-op games, Warhammer: Vermintide and Vermintide 2, which are a bit like medieval Left 4 Deads but with giant rats. This one&#x27;s set in the even grimmer and darker universe of the year 40K.
And it&#x27;s all quite supremely 40K, by the looks of things. We get a nice glimpse of the four classes - Psyker, Veteran, Zealot, Ogryn - blowing apart the hordes of cultists-cum-space-zombies in different ways.

Baker and Johnson, who play Joel and Ellie in Naughty Dog&#x27;s games, took to the stage during Summer Game Fest alongside The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann. Here, the duo revealed that, while they can&#x27;t say which characters they will be playing, they are very excited to be part of the show. They also introduced the leaked PlayStation 5 remake of Part 1 officially. You can see the trailer for it below.
Meanwhile, back to the show. Along with the news of Baker and Johnson&#x27;s upcoming roles, we also got a nice new picture from it. Here it is:

As you may have guessed, Boss Factory offers you the chance to really get stuck into the game&#x27;s character creator and make your own Boss (or Bosses plural, as you can indeed have up to six of them saved) and then have them ready to go for Saints Row&#x27;s full release.
You will have access to all of the game&#x27;s Boss customisation options, bar special progression-locked items (so yes, you can play around with those modesty emojis to your heart&#x27;s content).

                              <span>We had been promised that a new The Last of Us multiplayer component would be coming, and now we have a little bit more information on it. 
Its not much, but Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann has revealed a new piece of concept art (see the image above) for it and said it will be as big as any single-player game the team has done, if not bigger – which given the size of Part 2 is quite the claim! 
This multiplayer will have its own storyline and it takes place in another part of the United States. Is that the Golden Gate Bridge we can see over there? Hmm. Why, yes. Yes, I think it is.

                              <span>Following a tiny tease last October, Bloober Team - the developer behind the psychedelic horror chills of The Medium, Observer, and Blair Witch - has finally unveiled its latest Layers of Fear project: a remake of the previous two games in the series (plus DLC) bundled into a single, connected package for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.


Layers of Fears, to give the new experience its official (and faintly ridiculous) name, has been co-developed with Anshar Studios, and sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 to form what Bloober is calling a &quot;psychological horror chronicle&quot; - complete with new visuals, gameplay, and expanded plot lines.


Bloober says these new story elements will &quot;cast a new light on the overarching narrative&quot; as players face &quot;spine-chilling madness that extends over generations.&quot;

In a fresh trailer we saw a previously-unrevealed six-player online and local multiplayer option. Casey Jones is playable, too.


We also got a release date for the game - and it&#x27;s soon. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge launches for PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation and Xbox including via Game Pass on 16th June.

We only got to see a short CGI trailer as a tease, which featured robot enemies and some of that derelict lunar research station mentioned by indie developer Lunar Software 10 years ago.
After its initial announcement in 2012, Routine received some development updates, but got delayed multiple times, and here we are ten years after with the Summer Game Fest trailer, which you can check out below.

American Arcadia, which was initially teased earlier this year, takes place in a retro-futuristic metropolis where the citizens have no idea they&#x27;re actually contestants on the most watched reality show on the planet.


What follows is a daring escape - presented as a documentary, complete with interviews and police interrogations - as players take control of two different characters in two different locations, each with their own playstyles.

                              <span>At tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, we got a look at upcoming indie game Highwater from publisher Rogue Games and developer Demagog .
It is a colourful and playfully chunky looking strategy game, but one with a somber undertone. As the name suggests, it focuses on a world ravaged by the effects of global warming and the resulting high water levels. It also features a city called Alphaville, so yes, while I am writing this up, I am also singing Big in Japan. 
Here is the trailer for you to enjoy yourself.

                              <span>Flashback, the Delphine platformer from 1992, has a sequel on the way. It&#x27;s called Flashback 2, but the 2 is very small so it looks sciencey.


We&#x27;ve known about this for a while, but we&#x27;ve just got a proper glimpse of the game  at Geoff&#x27;s Summer Games Fest thing. I say proper glimpse -  the trailer&#x27;s stylish but tricky to read too much into. There&#x27;s lots of mantling and side-on platforming and the suggestion that physics and big robots both play a part, so that&#x27;s all okay with us.


Flashback 2 will be out this Winter on all the consoles and PC by the looks of it. Microids is in charge.

If you&#x27;re not up to date, this is the sequel to the 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which rebooted the series and re-imagined some of its popular characters.


Here we find them boarding a ship and getting into all sorts of shooty business. There&#x27;s a bit of that fancy water which Wes reported on in his earlier look at the game, too.

                              <span>Its Summer Game Fest time, and things have been kicked off with a trip into outer space. Yes, we have our first look at Dead Space 4. Sorry, I mean The Callisto Protocol (easy mistake to make).
As you would expect, it is a bloody horror filled rampage against some pretty ugly looking fellas. I am talking limbs coming off left, right and centre. There is also a look at a gravity gun in use, and our protagonist stomping down on a felled enemy&#x27;s corpse (because you just would if that thing came at you!). 
We also get to see, erm, well, someone getting trapped in a fan of sorts, resulting in them getting mushed up. To sum up, it&#x27;s unpleasant, clausterphobic and, won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;m here for it. See what you think for yourself below.

                              <span>Those pesky Xenomorphs are heading back PC and consoles next year in the newly announced Aliens: Dark Descent.


Coming from developer Tindalos Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment, Aliens: Dark Descent is described as a &quot;squad-based, single-player action game&quot; that sees players commanded their soldiers in real-time as they take on Xenomorphs - including Facehuggers, Praetorians, and Alien Queens - as well as rogue operatives from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.


&quot;Infiltrate large open levels and annihilate enemies with your squad, dispatching orders strategically and intuitively at the touch of a button,&quot; the game&#x27;s newly launched Steam page explains. &quot;Tread carefully, as your foes will adapt their tactics to your actions while hunting you down because death is permanent. Forge unique paths for survival, uncovering shortcuts, creating safe zones, and setting up motion trackers in a persistent world where your actions impact levels forever.&quot;

Moss: Book 2, which picks up immediately after the events of the first game, once again builds its action around a hybrid of first-person and third-person perspectives as players, in the role of an omniscient spirit, help guide mouse protagonist Quill on her quest to free the land from the clutches of the evil Arcane.


Polyarc&#x27;s sequel initially launched for PSVR earlier this year, and Eurogamer&#x27;s resident virtual reality aficionado Ian Higton was delighted to revisit the series&#x27; cinematic blend of puzzling and combat in his glowing Moss: Book 2 review.

                              <span>Ahead of tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, Sony&#x27;s The Last of Us Part 1 remake - one of the worst kept secrets in the industry today - has leaked. So yes, it is real. And not only is it really real, but it will also be releasing as soon as 2nd September for the PlayStation 5 at a retail price of $70. 
To accompany this news, we got our first look at the remake in action thanks to a brand-new trailer. You can check it out for yourself by following this link.
As you can see, the Ellie and Joel that we first met all the way back in 2013 now have a much sleeker look, but it is most certainly still them. There is fighting, there is compassion, and there are enough clickers to give one spores for thought throughout this reveal. Rather nicely, the game&#x27;s DLC - Left Behind - will also be included in this remake.

                              <span>A couple of months back, reddit user Shin was beavering away at an Elden Ring Game Boy remake.


And now it&#x27;s out! Available to play on itch.io, the game offers a miniature green-tinged version of the Lands Between - or at least, the Precipice of Anticipation, Northern Limgrave, and Stormveil Castle - presented in a Zelda-inspired top-down fashion.


The game runs in-browser, but Shin recommends using real Game Boy hardware or an Analogue Pocket for saving, better colours, and higher accuracy.

Dialogue between Kamala Khan and her high school friends revealed they play Super Smash Bros together - meaning Nintendo&#x27;s all-star fighter is now Marvel Cinematic Universe canon.


Kamala herself seemed to be a fan of Smash, though her friend Nakia was less keen.

A temporary fix was initially deployed which restricted the Battle Pass from granting unlocks (while progression would still be tracked).
However, work on a permanent fix led to the return of the same errors, leading DICE to revert all changes.

Microsoft announced a deal with Samsung to bring the Xbox App to 2022 Smart TVs at the end of the month, so you can play cloud-enabled Game Pass Ultimate games without a console.

Microsoft said playing Xbox games on 2022 Samsung TVs will be a seamless experience, similar to using any other streaming app on your telly. It also means you can play Fortnite via Xbox Cloud Gaming for free and without a subscription on your telly.

The new feature is expected to launch later this year, Microsoft said.


Microsoft&#x27;s announcement on this is pretty vague - there&#x27;s not much to go on beyond it&#x27;s a feature that&#x27;s coming out later in 2022. We don&#x27;t have a list of the &quot;select&quot; games that will work here, either.

Set to roll out within the next year, Project Moorcroft will see Microsoft pay developers to create demos of their upcoming games and bring them to the subscription service. Microsoft did not say whether there&#x27;s a mandated time-limit for these demos, or how long they will stick around the subscription service after launch.


The program kicks off with a focus on demos for indie games and helping their developers get data about and build excitement for their games.

The remaster of both Grand Theft Auto 5 and Online was first announced back in 2020 during the reveal of the PlayStation 5.

Today, we have been given a closer look at Bella Ramsay as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel on set, and it is actually pretty heartwarming. 
As shown in the tweet below, the two can be seen resting their weary heads on each other as production on the show goes on around them.

                              <span>As the Call of Duty community got its first real glimpse of Modern Warfare 2 (and we&#x27;re expecting more later today at Summer Game Fest), a lot of questions were still left unanswered. 


Fortunately, we got some new details from members of its Infinity Ward development team, courtesy of VentureBeat. 


First, as described in Eurogamer&#x27;s preview yesterday, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the engine&#x27;s fancy new water tech.

                              <span>When you think of CD Projekt Red and the word Cyberpunk together, you do get a certain thought in your head. Yes, we all get visions of that disastrous launch. However, this could all be about to change, as a new trailer and some bonus footage from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime has been revealed, and it looks pretty damn amazing in my eyes. 
The trailer, via Netflix, doesn&#x27;t give much away in terms of story beats, but it certainly sets the scene. There is neon, there is angst, there are explostions and gunfire a plenty and, oh yes, there are motorbikes.
Check it out for yourself below.

Yes, it&#x27;s another tie-in with the famous toy car brand, which has previously featured in Forza games, and also makes officially-licensed Forza car toys.

                              <span>With last night&#x27;s trailer reveal for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, fans of Activision&#x27;s largest franchise were left with sour taste after discovering the publisher has raised the price of last-gen versions of the game. 


Pre-ordering the game for either PlayStation 4 or Xbox One will cost players £69.99. That&#x27;s a hefty £10 increase from the asking for price for the franchise&#x27;s last title: Vanguard. 


The price rise is explained by the fact players are now forced to purchase the &quot;Cross-Gen Bundle,&quot; which includes both the last-gen and current-gen versions of the game.

                              <span>A new report into the development of Bethesda&#x27;s widely derided Fallout 76 has painted a picture of a studio in disarray, as poor management, a lack of design direction, and engine challenges created an environment of apathy, confusion, crunch, and burnout, and a game that ultimately failed to resonate with players.


Announced in 2018 and launched the following year, Fallout 76 - an online take on Bethesda&#x27;s beloved post-apocalyptic RPG series - was less than well-received at launch. Eurogamer&#x27;s Wesley Yin-Poole even went as far as to call it a &quot;bizarre, boring, broken mess&quot; before slapping it with an avoid badge.


Now, a lengthy new report from Kotaku - based on conversations with 10 former employees of Bethesda and parent company ZeniMax Media - has shed fresh light on the troubled development that lead to such a poorly received game, one seemingly doomed from the start.

                              <span>EA has responded to new claims Battlefield 2042 has entered &#x27;abandon ship&#x27; mode, insisting reports that only a skeleton crew is left working on the beleaguered shooter  are &quot;untrue&quot;.


Word that Battlefield 2042&#x27;s post-launch development has been dramatically downscaled was first shared by journalist Jeff Grubb on his Grubbsnax Giant Bomb show, where he claimed the remaining team has been tasked with delivering the four seasons of live service content promised to purchasers the &quot;fastest and the cheapest it possibly can&quot;.


&quot;This game is basically down to a skeleton crew,&quot; Grubb told viewers (thanks VGC). &quot;It&#x27;s down to like the bare bones and those people are specifically just working on the promised additional seasons that the game needs to meet the requirements of the high-end version that it sold.&quot;

                              <span>While the wait for more news on the second season of acclaimed League of Legends animated series Arcane continues, Riot Games has announced it&#x27;ll be airing a five-part making-of series for season one starting this August.


Arcane Act 1, as season one was officially known, launched on Netflix last November, charting the early years of two of League of Legends&#x27; most popular champions, sisters Jinx and Vi, in an around the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun.


The response from critics and League of Legends fans was strong (Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell called it &quot;absolutely a thrill, full of welcome colour and life&quot;, despite a few reservations), and Riot confirmed a second season was in the works mere weeks after season one&#x27;s arrival.

                              <span>The PC version of Call of Duty returns to Steam five years after ditching the platform in favour of Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.net.


Activision today confirmed Infinity Ward&#x27;s upcoming shooter Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will release on Steam as well as Battle.net when it comes out on 28th October.


It marks the return of the shooter franchise to Valve&#x27;s platform five years after Sledgehammer&#x27;s Call of Duty: WW2 came out in November 2017. That game went down as the last new PC Call of Duty to appear on Steam, with all subsequent mainline games (Black Ops 4, Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War and Vanguard), as well as free-to-play battle royale Warzone releasing on Battle.net exclusively.

                              <span>Following its unveiling back in March, developer ClockStone, the studio behind the popular Bridge Constructor series, has shared 16 minutes of gameplay from its upcoming diorama-based construction puzzler Lego Bricktales.


Lego Bricktales tasks players with traversing five gorgeous, brick-based dioramas - a lush jungle, sun-drenched desert, bustling city corner, medieval castle, and tropical island - as they undertake various quests and puzzles dished out by NPCs to help their grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.


Bricktales&#x27; core puzzling is based around a brick-by-brick building mechanic that encourages players to find a solution to the task at hand by constructing something useful from a limited number of bricks - a bridge, perhaps, or a physics-based flying machine.

Set in the world of Fódlan and featuring the same cast of characters as Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Three Hopes is an action musou take on the game. That means battles against hundreds of enemies and a big cast of characters to play as, depending on the house you choose.


News of the demo comes alongside a new trailer featuring a fresh look at gameplay.

                              <span>Some players are finding themselves unable to access EA games on PlayStation and Xbox if their console accounts are tied to an EA account with an expired password.


The problem centres around the fact that many players created EA accounts in the distant past - for one reader who got in contact, it was over a decade ago - and tied it to an email address that has long since been shut down. For anyone with a now-abandoned school or work email, it&#x27;s a similar story. 


Now, when EA&#x27;s account system asks for a password reset, it can only send an email to that lost address.

                              <span>Following its reveal and subsequent delay, Evil West now has a solid release date. So, get your weapons and holsters ready, as we will be blasting off into a rather weird looking version of the Wild West on 20th September.
Along with this news, we also have a brand-new trailer to enjoy. Expect plenty of chaos to unfold here, as we meet gunslinging ornery cowboy type Jesse Rentier. 

 To my eyes, Evil West looks like a mashup of Red Dead Redemption and Resident Evil but with more lightning. See what you think  below.

However, there is a catch. This will just be its beta (or &quot;flight&quot; in the words of developer 343 industries), and not the real deal. That is still slated to come some time later this year.
If you want to have a shot at this test flight, you will have to register to become a Halo Insider. This program is the &quot;official way for Halo fans and community members to partner with 343 Industries to help improve our games, products, and services.&quot;

A &quot;significant number&quot; of staff have now been laid off in order to meet &quot;dramatically reined in operating costs&quot;, Intellivision boss Phil Adam wrote in an email to customers, which has in turn led to further issues. 


However, Intellivision appears to be adamant it will still release the Amico at some point.

It&#x27;s a similarly styled sim game, this time taking place in space - obviously. Players will construct a spaceship and go on adventures across multiple, procedurally generated star systems.


The team is quick to note the game is not even in alpha yet, but has released a lengthy video showing off gameplay with placeholder art - give it a watch below.

Former Giantbomb host Jeff Gerstmann discussed what he&#x27;d seen of the game last night via Twitch, and suggested it was far enough along in development it could potentially be revealed as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Showcase on Sunday. 


As for the game itself, which Gerstmann said was currently in testing, it puts players in command of a &quot;Steve-like&quot; unit that directs others to fight off Minecraft enemies such as Piglins.

While Microsoft has not yet commented on his departure, an internal email sent on Tuesday and seen by Geek Wire confirmed Kipman&#x27;s exit, framing it as a company restructure. 
Within the email, head of Microsoft&#x27;s Cloud and AI Group Scott Guthrie said the changes being made &quot;will align and further accelerate [Microsoft&#x27;s] overall Metaverse efforts as a company this coming fiscal year&quot;.

Already in developer testing before a full public rollout this autumn, iOS 16 will allow you to use Nintendo&#x27;s controllers to play games - or do anything else app makers might imagine. 


The addition of Switch controller support follows the inclusion of support for both the PlayStation 5 DualSense and the Xbox Series X/S controllers last year, as part of iOS 14.5.

                              <span>Nintendo is reportedly figuring out what to do with a completed sequel to party game 1-2-Switch that has &quot;tested horribly&quot; among its target audience.


According to Fanbyte writer Imran Khan, citing multiple sources familiar with the game&#x27;s development, Nintendo made the decision to begin work on a 1-2-Switch sequel - reportedly known as Everybody&#x27;s 1-2-Switch - after the the original shifted a respectable 3.45m copies.


After several iterations, Nintendo is said to have settled on an idea inspired by the Jackbox Party Pack series for its 1-2-Switch sequel, where multiple players (up to 100 in some cases) could use their smartphones to compete in game-show-like mini-game challenges hosted by a man in a rubber horse mask. Reportedly, this somewhat radical shift in focus for the series was to ensure a too-similar sequel didn&#x27;t eat into the original mini-game compilation&#x27;s ongoing sales.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s Bend Studio, the developer perhaps best known for 2019&#x27;s post-apocalyptic bikes-and-zombies adventure Days Gone, has revealed a little more on its next project, a new IP that&#x27;ll include multiplayer and build on the open-world systems of Days Gone.


The Oregon-based studio - which worked on the likes of Syphon Filter, Resistance: Retribution, and Uncharted: Golden Abyss, and was acquired by Sony in 2000 - shared word on its latest venture in a PlayStation Blog post unveiling its new logo.


Bend&#x27;s new logo, designed to represent an &quot;abstract and modern interpretation of the studio&#x27;s history, location, and lifestyle&quot;, is accompanied by a closer look at the developer&#x27;s output over the last 29 years, culminating with a tease of its future.

                              <span>As if Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest wasn&#x27;t enough Fest to be getting on with, Valve has starting cranking the hype handle for its own Fest, Steam Next Fest, which returns for another demo-packed seven days starting Monday, 13th June.


This latest tumble into demo-land was confirmed by Valve back in March, when it promised &quot;hundreds&quot; of &quot;cool demos&quot; throughout the week, alongside developer livestreams, chats, and other assorted activities.


Proceedings get underway at 6pm BST/10am PT next Monday, 13th June, and will continue until the following Monday, 20th June. That&#x27;ll give you seven days to gorge on as many demos as possible (an increasingly daunting proposition the bigger Steam Next Fest gets), after which they&#x27;ll disappear once more.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima, designer of the legendary Metal Gear series and 2019&#x27;s Death Stranding, is reportedly working on a new horror game starring actress Margaret Qualley called Overdose.


That&#x27;s according to ceaseless leaker Tom Henderson, who, writing for Try Hard Guides, claims to have been sent early footage featuring a character - portrayed by Qualley, who previously played Mama in Death Stranding - roaming through dark corridors with a flashlight in her hand.


Henderson says the sequence (displayed from a third-person perspective, although a first-person mode is also rumoured) culminates in a jump scare that brings a Game Over message up on screen. That&#x27;s reportedly followed by the caption &quot;A Hideo Kojima Game... OVERDOSE&quot;.

                              <span>With E3 yet again absent from the gaming calendar and Geoff Keighley readying to return this week with his Summer Game Fest alternative, the ESA has re-emerged with a reminder it&#x27;s planning to bring E3 back as both a digital and in-person event next year.


E3&#x27;s future has been looking increasingly uncertain in recent times, given the ESA&#x27;s continuing struggle to adequately adapt the show in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The event has been cancelled twice in the last three years - first in 2020 and again this year - with 2021&#x27;s virtual event proving to be a decidedly lacklustre affair.


But even before coronavirus, E3&#x27;s domination of the gaming calendar was growing ever-more wobbly, as an increasing number of publishers - including Sony, EA, and Activision - all abandoned the show in order to focus on their own bespoke events outside of the E3 umbrella.

                              <span>Minecraft&#x27;s long-awaited The Wild Update arrives today and finally adds the game&#x27;s intriguing Deep Dark biome: a fresh slab of world for you to explore, underneath the game&#x27;s previously-permanent bedrock. It adds new enemies, fancy new building blocks and some odd new structures, left by past explorers. It&#x27;s something fans have been wanting to dig into for some time.


Mojang originally announced Deep Dark almost two years ago, back at Minecraft Live in 2020. At the time, the biome was set to be part of the game&#x27;s 2021 Caves and Cliffs Update (an offering that was further reshuffled after Caves and Cliffs was split in two). So, why the delay? What&#x27;s been happening with Minecraft in the interim? And what&#x27;s going on with that Jason Momoa Minecraft movie? I sat down with Minecraft&#x27;s game director Agnes Larsson and gameplay developer Ulraf Vakninthe to find out more.


&quot;We felt for a while &#x27;this is a risk but we might be able to do it&#x27;,&quot; Larsson told me, of Deep Dark&#x27;s original intended release date. &quot;But then when we realised [we had to delay], we tried to take the decision really quickly because we would risk making people in the team very, very stressed out. And we also communicated about it really quickly because we wanted to be as transparent as possible about such a big decision.

                              <span>Korean studio NCSoft has released a trailer for its forthcoming dramatic thriller Project M.


Developed in Unreal Engine 5 and releasing on console, the team is aiming for ultra-realistic graphics - and it&#x27;s certainly achieving that.


Judging by a blog post accompanying the trailer, NCSoft appear to be using 3D scanning, motion capture, and special effects, resulting in some incredibly detailed character models. You can see it in action in the trailer below.

Here, he revealed that Shantae was first conceived by his wife, Erin Bozon, in a bid to get more women and girls into video games.

                              <span>Court documents detailing the sentencing of Nintendo game pirate Gary Bowser have shed new light on how his 40-month sentence was designed to deter others from similar crimes.


Back in February, Bowser was told he would serve 40 months behind bars - more than three years - after pleading guilty to his part in the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices.


Now, newly-detailed documentation dug up by Axios and Kotaku has revealed how Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers and US district judge Robert Lasnik discussed Bowser&#x27;s jail time as a means to set an example - even as Bowser&#x27;s own lawyers argued his physical health was at risk, and argued that Bowser had already spent 16 months locked up awaiting trial.

                              <span>Former Arkane Lyon studio director Romuald Capron has joined the new Paris-based studio ZeDrimeTim to work on a new 1950s science fiction platformer.


The studio&#x27;s first game, Darwin&#x27;s Paradox, is a platform adventure game for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S that draws inspiration from Inside, Limbo, and Little Nightmares for a game &quot;filled with humour and influenced by the Golden Age of the 1950s science fiction and today&#x27;s 3D animation feature films&quot;.


It&#x27;s being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and will be released in early 2024.

                              <span>Classified military documents have been leaked to the War Thunder forum for the third time.


The MMO military vehicle combat game from Gaijin Entertainment has a fervent fanbase that demands realism from the developers.


But once again that&#x27;s gone too far, as classified documents of the DTC10-125 Chinese anti-tank missile have been leaked by fans in a further bid for realism.

                              <span>A new mod is adding some missing Greek gods to Hades, starting with Apollo, the god of music.


Modder AlexKage is behind OlympusExtra, available now on NexusMods (thanks Games Radar), which aims to add new gods, boons, voices and more.




Apollo, the first to be added, is the god of music - though he&#x27;s often also associated with the sun, as he took over riding its mythological golden chariot from Helios.

The game in question is called Grit and, well, it looks a lot like something that rhymes with grit but that I am too polite to write here. 
At its Galaverse convention yesterday, developer Gala Games revealed it had &quot;signed a partnership with Epic&quot;, presumably to release the title via its storefront. Gala then went on to chat more about Grit, its wild-west themed battle royale which you can see in the trailer above.

The decision - unanimously agreed by all 16 voters at Keywords Studios - means collective bargaining on worker rights will now begin. 


This drive for unionisation comes amid a wider push for video game worker unions in the US, and after a previous squabble between staff and Keywords bosses over returning to work in-office.

One idea was a battle royale mode featuring only blue mages - the unique job that learns skills and magic by battling enemies.

That&#x27;s a nice bit of expectation-setting, then - don&#x27;t expect reveals of unannounced games. Then again, there&#x27;s still plenty Capcom has now revealed which it can discuss in more detail: including the &quot;reimagined&quot; Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6.

&quot;There isn&#x27;t a Fortnite cryptocurrency,&quot; he stated &quot;The Twitter accounts promoting such a thing are a scam. Epic&#x27;s lawyers are on it.&quot;

                              <span>In a first for the series, Street Fighter 6 lets you change your character&#x27;s facial expression during the versus screen.


Capcom revealed the feature via a short clip posted to Twitter, below, that shows Luke and Ryu change their facial expression a couple of times with the camera up close and personal.


&quot;Show your attitude with the Game Face Feature in #StreetFighter6 by pressing directional buttons during the versus screen,&quot; reads the tweet.

                              <span>DICE will be revealing first gameplay of the beleaguered Battlefield 2042&#x27;s long-awaited Season 1 this Tuesday, 7th June, and there&#x27;s a new update promising &quot;hundreds of changes, bug fixes and quality of life improvements&quot; due on the same day.
DICE has, of course, been steadily working to improve Battlefield 2042 since its launch last November, when it quickly become one of Steam&#x27;s worst-reviewed games of all time. While the developer has committed to bringing this latest Battlefield &quot;up to the highest standards that we all hold for the franchise&quot;, it&#x27;s only now, some eight months after its release, that players will finally get a first look at the game&#x27;s long-delayed first season of post-launch content.
Those curious to see what DICE has in store for Battlefield 2042&#x27;s first season, known as Zero Hour, will be able to see its gameplay premiere tomorrow, Tuesday 7th June at 4pm/8am PDT.

                              <span>Acclaimed point-and-click specialist Wadjet Eye Games - the studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the celebrated Blackwell series - has unveiled its latest contribution to the genre, time-travelling adventure Old Skies.


Old Skies cast players as Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers who&#x27;ve paid for a sightseeing jaunt to the past. &quot;Some are simply curious,&quot; explains Wadjet Eye. &quot;Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It&#x27;s only time travel, after all.&quot;


Wadjet Eye is promising seven distinct time periods from history to explore - &quot;from the speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age to the morning of September 11th&quot; - with puzzles set to take advantage of the game&#x27;s temporal premise.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s live-action adaptation of Capcom&#x27;s survival horror classic Resident Evil has received another trailer ahead of its 14th July release.


The new live-action series - not to be confused with Netflix&#x27;s four-episode CGI effort Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, which launched last year - splits its Racoon-City-focused storyline across two distinct timelines, straddling either side of a global apocalypse caused by a deadly virus.


At one end, pre-apocalypse, we follow the adventures of teenage sisters Jade and Billie Wesker as they begin to notice strange things are afoot in New Racoon City. Then, 14 years later in 2036, Jade takes centre-stage as she struggles to survive in a world overrun by the blood-thirsty infected and ponders the fate of her sister.

Ahead of its airing, however, host Geoff Keighley has warned viewers expecting major reveals to &quot;manage your expectations&quot;, saying the event will be &quot;primarily focused&quot; on already announced games.


Speaking during a Twitter Spaces audio session over the weekend (as transcribed by VGC), Keighley said he was &quot;very excited&quot; about the titles set to feature during Thursday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, but warned viewers to &quot;definitely manage your expectations in terms of the megaton shocks that you’re expecting. This is not The Game Awards.&quot;


&quot;We’ve got lots of good stuff to show you,&quot; he added, &quot;but buyer beware of some of the crazy rumours I&#x27;m seeing out there in terms of things people expect to get announced.&quot;

                              <span>The climbing mechanic in Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End almost saw lithe hero Nathan Drake come with his own little stamina bar in a bid to give an extra layer of difficulty to the game.
Naughty Dog&#x27;s Josh Scherr, who co-wrote A Thief&#x27;s End with Neil Druckmann and then went on to co-write The Lost Legacy, was a guest on YouTube channel Couch Soup over the weekend. Here, Scherr shared more about his illustrious career with Naughty Dog (which has spanned over 20 years) and gave some behind the scenes insight into Uncharted 4&#x27;s development.
Scherr praised the power of PlayStation 4, and said it was &quot;specifically designed to not be super complicated with a cell processor and six SPUs and all that other crazy stuff&quot;, likening it to a &quot;fancy version of a high-end PC&quot;. This means more time for developers to focus on other areas of a game sooner, such as its story development.

                              <span>The hashtag #DelaySonicFrontiers has been trending following the game&#x27;s first gameplay reveal.


First unveiled at the end of last year, fans have been desperate to see gameplay of Sonic Frontiers ever since. Two videos have now been released exclusively to IGN, showcasing the game&#x27;s open world design and its combat.


But so far fans are unhappy with the direction of the game and - just as with Sonic&#x27;s redesign for the film series - are calling for a delay.

The message, from chief people officer Mala Singh, follows internal criticism of EA by some employees for not speaking out sooner in support - as other game developers have. 
&quot;I want to acknowledge the pain and fear that our LGBTQ+, specifically our Transgender community, is experiencing in light of emerging legislation in the US and the ongoing attacks on their human rights,&quot; Singh wrote in post shared on EA&#x27;s blog. &quot;We will continue to strive for a safe and supportive workplace, and as a leadership team, we want to be clear about what we stand for:

However, while great, these games are a product of their time, and as such can look a little rough around the edges. Well, not anymore!
Now, thanks to an emulator developer that goes by the name of Darío, these legendary games have been given not only ray-tracing upgrades, but also object motion blur, widescreen, DLSS and 60+ FPS.

Chapter 3 Season 3, subtitled as &quot;Vibin&#x27;&quot;, offers a more relaxed aesthetic, with the Island&#x27;s survivors celebrating their hard-won victory with a party. Last season&#x27;s underground base is now a giant rave cavern, with a rollercoaster you can ride using the game&#x27;s returning Baller vehicles (think those spheres from Jurassic World). 


A large chunk of the Island has also been transformed into a punk-fantasy jungle, with an enormous bioluminescent tree you can scamper around.

                              <span>Splitgate&#x27;s beta season two is now live on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.


The new season of the free-to-play portal-hopping shooter brings a number of updates, including three new game modes and a remastered Abyss map.


That&#x27;s on top of revamped matchmaking as part of a migration to a new server, which means getting into matches quicker, fewer bots, and more similarly-skilled opponents.

                              <span>Two things named Gotham Knights are currently set to release over the coming year. One is a video game (coming in the latter half of 2022), and one is a TV show (coming early 2023), and both see a group rallying together to fight the crime in Gotham following Batman&#x27;s demise. 
However, despite sharing a name, an overarching concept and a pretty close launch window, these two have no relation to each other what&#x27;s so ever. Huh.
&quot;Message from the Belfry: the #GothamKnights game and the upcoming TV show of the same name are separate projects with no connection to one another,&quot; Batman Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Montreal tweeted. &quot;We can&#x27;t wait for you to experience the action of our Gotham Knights soon.&quot;

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Go Fest, Pokémon Go&#x27;s annual summer weekend extravangaza, has shaken up the game with the introduction of a new Mythical creature, the arrival of the franchise&#x27;s extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts, and the apparent (albeit likely temporary) loss of everyone&#x27;s favourite hunky professor, Willow.


The disappearance of Willow, a surprise twist for the game&#x27;s second day, means the game has been left without its usual friendly face guiding players through the game&#x27;s story. A mysterious stranger named Rhi, who looks to be a new ally, has instead taken Willow&#x27;s place while players investigate the emergence of the first Ultra Beasts. 


These creatures are likely the cause of Willow&#x27;s absence, and will hopefully be a continued focus over the game&#x27;s new Season of Go. For now at least, Willow&#x27;s absence appears to be a story development that will stick for some time, with standard in-game text changed throughout the app to remove references to the professor. (For those overly concerned, a Go Fest finale event for existing ticket holders, coming in August, seems likely to revolve around his revival.)

                              <span>Sega producer Yosuke Okunari has confirmed that the reason the company didn&#x27;t pursue creating a mini Dreamcast or Saturn because &quot;both developing and manufacturing new chipsets during the pandemic is a difficult and expensive process&quot;.

In an interview with Famitsu, Okunari said - as paraphrased by Gosokkyu (thanks, NintendoLife) - the company did &quot;explore the idea&quot; of a Dreamcast or Saturn Mini but ultimately decided not to pursue it when Sega discovered manufacturing mini consoles had become more expensive post-pandemic (and post semiconductor shortage, of course).

Okunari added that the Mega Drive Mini&#x27;s internals &quot;can&#x27;t adequately handle Saturn games&quot;, and manufacturing new chipsets would be prohibitively expensive, joking that if they&#x27;d proceeded with the idea, the cost of buying a Dreamcast of Saturn Mini could rival that of a modern-day console.

                              <span>Capcom has acknowledged that leaked details and video clips of Street Fighter 6 have shown us &quot;things we weren&#x27;t supposed to see&quot;.

In the wake of the game&#x27;s appearance on Thursday&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play presentation, images purporting to be of 22 Street Fighter 6 characters - many of whom had yet to be formally revealed - popped up online, including all eight World Warriors from Street Fighter 2.

That wasn&#x27;t all, though - the leak also included video clips of the characters, too.

                              <span>It hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet, let alone released, but Rare employees seem to be unlocking achievement for a Xbox port of GoldenEye 007 that has yet to be announced. 

As spotted by our pals over at VGC, Xbox achievement tracker TrueAchievements has been tracking the unlocked - and public - achievements of BIGsheep, an alleged Rare developer who has been working through the game since October 2021.
After a brief hiatus between February and April, the dev has most recently unlocked an achievement called &quot;Merciless&quot;, which awards you for killing an unarmed player in multiplayer.

                              <span>It costs £88,000 ($110,000) to fully upgrade a character in Diablo Immortal.

That&#x27;s according to Bellular News (thanks, GameRant), which has calculated that to fully max out a character, a player would need to spend over $100,000 on microtransactions, as it&#x27;s seemingly not possible to do so without spending real money. You can check out the full breakdown below:

Players in Diablo Immortal have three progression pillars: XP level, equipment level, and Legendary Gems. The first two are pretty standard fare in any RPG-type game, but collating Legendary Gems can be a costly and convoluted process as the way you get them is randomised and often exceedingly rare... and right now, it seems as though F2P players cannot earn them at all.

The press release stops short of detailing much else about the upcoming game - details will be &quot;revealed at a later date&quot;, apparently, although a quick snoop on Disruptive&#x27;s website hints that it&#x27;s coming to PC as well as unspecified PlayStation and Xbox consoles - but Disruptive Games has worked on several notable titles, including Diablo II: Resurrected, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, and Godfall. 

The studio says it is now focused on &quot;multiplayer-first gaming experiences that immerse players in living worlds&quot;.

                              <span>More reports have surfaced suggesting upcoming PS5 game Abandoned is &quot;not actively being worked on&quot; and &quot;there is no game&quot; in development.

The claims come from GameSpot , which alleges it has information directly from a private Discord server through which Hasan Kahraman of Blue Box Game Studios, Abandoned&#x27;s director, communicates with a handful of selected fans. 

In exchange for access to &quot;screenshots, animations, and even a page of the game&#x27;s script&quot;, the members are required to sign a NDA, so some would only speak about the project under strict anonymity. Should any member of the server press Kahraman - who is described as &quot;duplicitous and prone to mood swings&quot; - for clarification or more details, they risk being banned from the small community.

                              <span>It looks like pre-orders for Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns are about to go live ahead of an October release date.

That&#x27;s according to a new leak - which the source insists was obtained via an anonymous online retailer - that seemingly backs up prior claims that the game is set to release on 6th October and will be available in three flavours: a standard, enhanced, and legendary edition.

The claims may have flown entirely under the radar, but the images accompanying the leaker&#x27;s tweets - thought to have been box art - have all been zapped with a copyright notice from a senior legal assistant at Take-Two, leading many to believe they are genuine.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s latest season has concluded with this year&#x27;s first big live event, as the battle royale Island&#x27;s heroes aimed to end the villainous Imagined Order faction for good. 


Starting off the event, players found themselves in groups of up to four people inside Fortnite&#x27;s bear mech for the first time. Here, you could peer out from its bridge and onto an unfamiliar landscape - an icy moon which orbits the main Fortnite Island - and play around with gun turrets while listening to brief audio chatter between heroes Jones (Troy Baker), The Origin (Rahul Kohli) and The Foundation (Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson).


With a minute to go, a mission briefing finally re-introduced the mech&#x27;s pilot The Paradigm and laid out the stakes: the evil IO were set to detonate a superweapon capable of killing everyone, and it was up to you inside the mech to stop it. (Never mind that this is your goal in each battle royale match.) So off we went, blasting into space, through an asteroid field, and towards our best view of the Fortnite island floating through the multiverse yet.

The reimagined version of Capcom&#x27;s survival horror classic Resident Evil 4 kicked off yesterday&#x27;s State of Play showcase with an eye-catching trailer, complete with a release date: 24th March 2023.

The reveal teaser also included something else: a disclaimer, stating &quot;Leon&#x27;s brown sheepskin leather bomber jacket appears with permission from Schott NYC&quot;.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced it is &quot;no longer targeting a FY23 release&quot; for its troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.
Following rumours that The Sands of Time remake - which has moved release date several times now - was being delisted at some major retailers, Ubisoft released a brief statement confirming the game has formally been &quot;delisted&quot; as the game&#x27;s latest development studio, Ubisoft Montreal &quot;continue[s] the work to deliver a great remake&quot;.

The Sands of Time remake was being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai, but the project has been dogged by setbacks since its unveiling in September 2020. Shortly after its announcement, Ubisoft moved its launch date from January 2021 to March that same year, but February brought a second delay, this time indefinitely, while the team worked on delivering &quot;a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original&quot;.

                              <span>Sega has unveiled Mega Drive Mini 2, its latest mini retro console.

Last week, Sega hinted it had a big &quot;new project&quot; to share with us this week, teasing that the broadcast would reportedly include appearances from Hiroyuki Miyazaki and Yosuke Okunari. Given the guests, it wasn&#x27;t a stretch to presume the secret new project may have something to do with a new Sega retro console - and it turns out that&#x27;s exactly what Sega was teasing.

As yet, we don&#x27;t have any information on English social media, but the reveal has been posted to Sega Japan&#x27;s official YouTube channel, which you can check out below:

The demo gives players their first taste of gameplay and the unique abilities of the game&#x27;s 10 playable characters, but online team battles are only available during specific hour-long sessions throughout the weekend, with the next being at noon UK time.

The demo&#x27;s available now to download if you have a Nintendo Switch Online Subscription (those without one can sign for a seven-day free trial). Online team battles allow you to team up with friends online to challenge others - with a maximum of four players per team across two consoles - as well as random competitors.

Instead of &quot;participating&quot; in Cologne, Nintendo states that &quot;instead, players will be able to try out the games for Nintendo Switch at numerous events throughout Germany&quot;.

&quot;Gamescom is a key event in Nintendo’s calendar of events,&quot; Nintendo said in a statement to Games Wirtschaft (thanks, VGC). &quot;This year, however, after careful consideration, we have decided against participating in Cologne.

                              <span>EA has finally confirmed that the Werewolf expansion is coming to The Sims 4.

The Sims 4 Werewolves Game Pack - which releases on Steam, Origin, and Xbox on 16th June - brings &quot;unique temperaments and abilities, be affected by the phase of the moon, and experience wolf-specific life events&quot;.

It&#x27;ll be welcomed news for Simmers who may have been disappointed that werewolves were not part of the recent update, despite EA teasing that werewolves might finally be making a return to the series for the first time since The Sims 3&#x27;s Supernatural expansion.

                              <span>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield&#x27;s very Dead-Space-like sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol finally has a release date and is heading to PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC on 2nd December this year.


The Callisto Protocol, which was officially unveiled back in December 2020, is a third-person horror game set in 2320. Its action unfolds within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto, and - needless to say - suffocating terror and &quot;terrifying secrets&quot; ensue.


We&#x27;ve only seen a single cinematic of The Callisto Protocol since its intriguing 2020 reveal, so it&#x27;s nice to finally, properly see the thing in action courtesy of its brand-new release date trailer - which includes a smattering of gameplay - below. It looks like appropriately atmospheric, deliciously icky stuff - and, yes, not entirely dissimilar to Dead Space.

Naoki Yoshida introduced a new trailer for the game at the PlayStation State of Play you can watch below, which gave us a fresh look at the game&#x27;s story and gameplay.


In particular it showcased the game&#x27;s cast of summons, or Eikons as they&#x27;re known, their names chanted in the music if you listen carefully: Phoenix, Titan, Garuda, Ramuh, Shiva, Odin, Bahamut, and Ifrit.

Horizon Call of the Mountain, which was announced back in January, is a first-person experience set the series&#x27; gorgeous, post-apocalypse world. It casts players as a new character -  Ryas, a former Shadow Carja Warrior who hopes to redeem himself by investigating a grave threat to the Sundom - and sets them on an adventure featuring main series protagonist Aloy and a host of other familiar faces.


Call of the Mountain&#x27;s new trailer, revealed during tonight&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, offers a first proper look at the game in action - including some of the activities players will be able to partake in using Sony&#x27;s upgraded VR kit, such as archery and mountain climbing - and it would be an understatement to say it all looks spectacular indeed.

                              <span>PlayStation has 30 minutes of annoucements for you tonight, and you can watch them all right here. 


Sony&#x27;s summer announcement show will include &quot;exciting reveals&quot; from the company&#x27;s third-partner partners, we&#x27;re told, plus a look at several games in development for PlayStation VR2.


Does this rule out an update on God of War, PlayStation&#x27;s next big release? We&#x27;ll have to wait and see. Boy, keep those fingers crossed it&#x27;s still on track for 2022.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is the name of the next game in BioWare&#x27;s fantasy role-playing series.


In a blog post, BioWare touched on the subtitle, which is an alias of Dragon Age: Inquisition party member Solas.

&quot;Solas, the Dread Wolf,&quot; reads the official blurb. &quot;Some say he might be an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people... or a saviour who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world.

                              <span>Researchers have demonstrated controlling touchscreens at a distance, at least in a laboratory setting:
The core idea is to take advantage of the electromagnetic signals to execute basic touch events such as taps and swipes into targeted locations of the touchscreen with the goal of taking over remote control and manipulating the underlying device.
The attack, which works from a distance of up to 40mm, hinges on the fact that capacitive touchscreens are sensitive to EMI, leveraging it to inject electromagnetic signals into transparent electrodes that are built into the touchscreen so as to register them as touch events...</span>

                              <span>Casting for Sony&#x27;s live-action Twisted Metal series continues, with the news that Will Arnett - known for the likes of BoJack Horseman, The Lego Batman Movie, and Arrested Development - will voice the role of insane clown Sweet Tooth.


According to Variety, the show&#x27;s version of the iconic Sweet Tooth is a &quot;hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning. A lover of chaos, this majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses &#x27;Lost Vegas&#x27; as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck.&quot;


The Twisted Metal series - a half-hour action comedy scripted by Cobra Kai writer Michael Jonathan Smith for Peacock - follows a motor-mouthed outsider, played by Anthony Mackie, who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland dominated by savage marauders driving vehicles of destruction.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s brief gameplay tease, Sega has released a considerably more substantial seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay, offering a much clearer look at how the hedgehog&#x27;s first foray into open-world platforming will likely play out.


Yesterday&#x27;s footage was perhaps most notable for the rather muted art style Sega has opted for this time around, with the game - at least from what we&#x27;ve seen so far - placing Sonic in a realistically hewn world that almost feels closer to the sodden, boulder-pocked hillsides of Death Stranding than it does the colour-blasted Sonic backdrops of old.


We get to see a lot more of that expansive landscape in Sega&#x27;s newly shared seven minutes of Sonic Frontiers gameplay (thanks IGN), with the bulk of the footage focused on leisurely exploration as Sonic roams around, solving puzzles to unlock new elements in the world.

                              <span>Velan Studios&#x27; competitive &quot;dodgebrawl&quot; game Knockout City has officially gone free-to-play.


Knockout City - which launched on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC last May - was initially published under the EA Originals label, but earlier this year Velan announced it would be taking over publishing duties and shifting to a free-to-play model starting with its sixth season.


Both the free version of Knockout City and Season 6: City of Tomorrow are now here, introducing, among other things, the new Boomerang Ball across all playlists, the Starfruit Special energy drink, the sci-flyer crew vehicle, a permanent new career contract, an expanded hideout area, various map improvements, and more, as detailed in today&#x27;s patch notes.

Boltgun is a single-player FPS in which you play a Space Marine who shoots the living crap out of all the Chaos Space Marines and daemons of Chaos sprites who dare get in his way. Doomguy would be proud!

Saber Interactive&#x27;s Space Marine sequel was announced at last year&#x27;s The Game Awards with a fancy CGI trailer that confirmed the return of Ultramarines hard man Captain Titus, as well as a few GIFs&#x27; worth of gameplay.


The new trailer, below, includes talking heads from Saber discussing their passion for the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Titus actor Clive Standen pottering about in full motion capture get-up, as well as a handful of new blink-and-you&#x27;ll miss them clips.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal - Blizzard&#x27;s free-to-play take on its long-running dungeon crawler series - has started its global roll-out, and is now available to download on iOS and Android devices in certain territories.


First announced at BlizzCon in 2018 - where it was less than warmly received by attendees - Diablo Immortal takes place between the events of Diablo 2 and 3, adapting the classic dungeon crawling formula of its predecessors for mobile devices - which, among other things, means a free-to-play monetisation model based around in-app purchases.


Starting out in the city of Westmarch, players can adopt one of six classes - Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Crusader, Necromancer, or Demon Hunter - and journey out to explore eight areas along with other adventurers. Blizzard and co-developer NetEase have previously said additional zones, storylines, loot, and classes will be added over time.

                              <span>To celebrate Pride Month, Xbox is releasing a brand new controller design that incorporates 34 community flags.


The flags are in &quot;a fine, interwoven manner to celebrate the nuance, complexity, intersectionality, and strength of the many LGBTQIA+ communities&quot;, explains an Xbox Wire post.


Last year, Xbox created a limited number of Pride controllers but many players wanted it to be universally available. This year&#x27;s controller will therefore be customisable in the Xbox Design Lab.

                              <span>On 16th June, those who own either a Nintendo Switch, an Xbox or a PlayStation will be able to get their hands on the formally PC exclusive and BAFTA winning Autonauts. 
For those who don&#x27;t know already, Autonauts is a game where you build and then train robots to automate the world around you. Sounds easy enough, but there is a catch. In short, these robots are only ever going to be as smart as you tell them to be.
It is up to you as the player to teach your bots what do. You will need to upgrade them and expand their brains as the game progresses, opening up their full operational potential. You can build dozens of different workerbots on your planet and make it a &quot;fully functioning home&quot; with their help. By fully functioning home, we are talking cooking, mining, construction, you name it.

Once enabled in the settings, players can access the mode and snap away. The team at Shedworks also have a photography competition planned, as noted in the latest update blog.


That same blog also details a number of other fixes and additions to the game. Most importantly, changes have been made to the camera to reduce motion sickness when riding vehicles.

All episodes of the game were also free this time last year for the same reason. 

While the first episode is free all year round and the whole game is available on Xbox Game Pass, it&#x27;s nice to have the opportunity own the whole game to play on your own time.

                              <span>Nvidia has created a new map within Minecraft powered by RTX technology to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s  Platinum Jubilee. 


Built by artist Ushio Tokura, the map features a full recreation of Buckingham Palace and Pall Mall, along with a street party that includes bunting, cake, champagne and a game of pin the tail on the corgi (I hope they got permission from the council). 


The map took three designers 650 hours within two weeks to build, 45m blocks and covers a virtual area of roughly 830,000 square feet.

Speaking of the game&#x27;s world, this will be the first Pokémon role-playing game where you can freely explore the entire map from the off - and &quot;not in an order dictated by the story&quot;, as The Pokémon Company clarified today. 


&quot;Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet allow multiplayer gameplay with up to four players,&quot; The Pokémon Company said. &quot;Along with series staples, such as trading and battling Pokémon, you will be able to explore the various locations of the region in these games with other players. You can discover new Pokémon and explore unfamiliar areas with your friends and family, opening the door to an adventure more precious and fun than ever!&quot;

Today, however, Chucklefish released a handful of new screenshots showing more of Witchbrook in action - and still in development. First off, above, we have a literal witch and a brook. And ducks. 


Below, there&#x27;s a glimpse at the game&#x27;s garden area and greenhouse. Is this where herbology is taught? We can also see a variety of character models showing young witches and wizards from different backgrounds. Also a sleeping cat.

                              <span>The seventh expansion for Prison Architect, Gangs, is heading our way &quot;soon&quot;. And, as you may have guessed, this means players are going to have to ready themselves for some gang warfare.
&quot;Bring order to your correctional facility and manage its Boiling Point, reforming gang members and protecting inmates and staff,&quot; announced Paradox Interactive and Double Eleven today. &quot;Show gangs who&#x27;s boss by enforcing a strict code of conduct among your inmates, and turn gang members into valuable members of society.&quot;
So, that all sounds very exciting, but what is this Boiling Point you speak of, Victoria? Well, I am so glad you asked.

Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins will unite players with the titular Frogger as he learns about the lost treasure of an ancient frog tribe (why are they ancient - your guess is as good as mine, but I&#x27;d say... maybe they croaked?). 
However, this is not all. Along with the promise of hidden riches, something else strange is going on, as &quot;an alarming number of froglets are disappearing around the world&quot;. You can check out the new trailer for Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins below.

Consumer protection agencies in 18 European countries have backed the report and called for better regulation of video games. 


The report uses both FIFA 22 and Raid: Shadow Legends as case studies to demonstrate the &quot;wide arsenal of tricks to push consumers into spending as much time and money as possible exploiting consumers hope to receive the reward despite a miniscule chance and likelihood to do so&quot;.

Kerri Moynihan, a 32-year-old finance manager at Activision, died in 2017 while attending a company retreat. 


The incident publicly came to light as part of California&#x27;s still-ongoing lawsuit against Activision, filed last July,  which has alleged multiple instances of discrimination and misconduct at the company.

In addition, Tate Mode will allow players to rotate the handheld for vertical play - the screen has been designed for this and the console includes extra buttons to accommodate the change in orientation.

The Big Box PC Game Collectors group has ousted Enrico Ricciardi after several members came forward with counterfeit copies of classic games which they had purchased from Ricciardi. 
The group has now shared a public document (via Kotaku) detailing its investigation and subsequent evidence against Ricciardi. This document states: &quot;If you have received games from [Ricciardi], check them closely and compare with known originals. I advise to presume they are fake, because our investigation has unearthed quite a bit more alleged forgeries than real.&quot;

                              <span>Respawn boss Vince Zampella and The Sims exec Lyndsay Pearson have issued statements supporting the rights of women and transgender people, as EA continues to be pressured by employees to make a wider statement of its own. 


The remarks, posted publicly on Twitter overnight, reportedly follow an internal meeting within EA on LGBTQ+ issues, Kotaku reported. 


There, the publisher was again asked by employees whether it would make a public statement on these issues - and reportedly again kept to its previous line that these topics were subject to different points of view across the company.

                              <span>PC gamers rejoice!  God of War on PC has been updated to support AMD&#x27;s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.0. 


For those of you out of the loop, I highly recommend you give Digital Foundry&#x27;s explainer a read, where Alex Battaglia explains it much more eloquently than I ever could. 


In short, FSR 2.0 is a suite of image upscaling technologies which let your PC run the game at a lower internal resolution, which is then reconstructed to be close to indistinguishable from its native resolution.

Having joined Squaresoft (as it was known)in 1995, Hashimoto later became the brand manager for the Final Fantasy series and co-creator of Kingdom Hearts.


He shared a message of his retirement on his Twitter, as well as a video message on the Square Enix account where he explained his love for meeting fans at events, something he&#x27;s sadly been unable to do due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Konami did not go into the specifics of why it has made this decision, only citing &quot;various circumstances&quot; as the catalyst for the service&#x27;s closure.

This should save quite a bit of time for completionists, who will no longer have to resort to Google in order to find the one pesky achievement that haunts your nightmares.


To find the hidden details, just open the Xbox Guide from within a game and go to Game Activity and then Achievements. After that, you just need to find the achievement you&#x27;re after and manually select to unhide it.

Author: Paris Pittman (Steering Committee)
Last year, we published our first Annual Report Summary for 2020 and it&#x27;s already time for our second edition!
2021 Annual Report Summary
This summary reflects the work that has been done in 2021 and the initiatives on deck for the rest of 2022. Please forward to organizations and indidviduals participating in upstream activities, planning cloud native strategies, and/or those looking to help out. To find a specific community group&#x27;s complete report, go to the kubernetes/community repo under the groups folder. Example: sig-api-machinery/annual-report-2021.md
You’ll see that this report summary is a growth area in itself. It takes us roughly 6 months to prepare and execute, which isn’t helpful or valuable to anyone as a fast moving project with short and long term needs. How can we make this better? Provide your feedback here: https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/242

                              <span>Yu Suzuki - the legendary designer behind the likes of Sega classics Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, OutRun, and Space Harrier - has unveiled new 3D shooter Air Twister, which is making its way to Apple Arcade on 24th June.


Air Twister is a fantasy &quot;swipe&quot; shooter - developed by Shenmue 3 studio YS Net - that asks players, in the role of Princess Arch, to battle alien invaders and save their planet from destruction using their trusty homing arrows.


As the trailer reveals, there&#x27;s a definite Space Harrier vibe to the whole thing - with a touch of Panzer Dragoon thrown in when our lead takes to the skies on the back of a giant swan - and, according to an interview attended by GameSpot, Air Twister is based on a fantasy shooting game Yu Suzuki envisaged in the 80s, before he adapted the idea into Space Harrier due to the technical limitations of the time.

                              <span>Ofcom has published its annual report into the UK&#x27;s online habits - including plenty of stats for how many of us are now playing online games, paying for subscriptions, and trying to beat Wordle. 


39 percent of UK adults aged 16 or over play games online, Ofcom says, with 56 percent of children aged three to 15 playing games online. The average time spent each week playing games online was 7 hours and 33 minutes, including PC, console, VR and smartphone gaming.


These figures come from Ofcom surveys completed in late 2021, so after formal lockdowns had ended, Ofcom noted. In general, there was a dip in the amount of time younger people played online games year-on-year, though a growth in time spent playing online games for those aged 55-64.

                              <span>Adeline Software&#x27;s much-loved Little Big Adventure series can now be enjoyed with a welcome selection of modern day niceties - including cloud saves, controller support, and Steam achievements - thanks to a brand-new update on Steam.


The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that followed young hero Twinsen as he attempted to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. Needless to say, at now over a quarter of a century old, both were decidedly lacking in modern day polish.


Developer 2.21, which now owns the rights to the series (and counts Little Big Adventure co-creator Didier Chanfray as a founder), announced it would be upgrading Little Big Adventure 1 &amp; 2 back in March, although there was no estimated time of arrival for its enhancements.

                              <span>Almost exactly one year after Sonic Frontiers&#x27; initial tease, Sega has returned with a new brand-new trailer offering our first, brief look at some gameplay for the hedgehog&#x27;s latest adventure.


Sonic Frontiers was first teased at the end of last May (with only the vaguest of CGI trailers and no name), but it wasn&#x27;t until December that first proper details emerged, with Sega describing the title as Sonic&#x27;s &quot;first ever open zone&quot; game.


&quot;Accelerate to new heights and experience the thrill of high velocity open-zone freedom,&quot; the publisher said at the time. &quot;Battle powerful enemies as you speed through the Starfall Islands - landscapes brimming with dense forests, overflowing waterfalls, sizzling deserts and more!&quot;.

                              <span>Get ready earthlings, Crypto is back (no, not that planet burning kind). THQ Nordic has revealed that Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is heading our way on 30th August, with alien invader Crypto - or to be more precise, the next Crypto: Cryptosporidium 138 - leading the charge (ok, so maybe &quot;that planet burning kind&quot; is actually still accurate...).
THQ has promised this release will be a faithful remake of 2006&#x27;s alien filled caper, complete with &quot;five huge open-world areas&quot;. These areas are Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and, what with this being a game with an out of this world entity roaming through its maps, the Moon. 
But, who exactly will players come across within these vast maps? Well, as Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is set in the swinging &#x27;60s, you will have to deal with more than a small handful of hippies on your quest for glory.

&quot;On the 24th of February 2022, our Heart of Russia team was some six to eight weeks away from completing work on the highly anticipated new DLC. We all felt really good about the result; a lot of effort had been invested in making this new region look truly fantastic in the game,&quot; SCS shared in a blog post yesterday.
&quot;We were absolutely sure that our community, especially those in Russia, would really appreciate that. Then, all of a sudden, the entire world was rocked by the news that Ukraine had been invaded by Russia.&quot;

But since its worldwide release, the game&#x27;s deep links to cryptocurrency and upcoming plans for NFTs have come under the spotlight (thanks, Kotaku).


Players can earn Territe, a currency which can then be exchanged for &quot;Territe Tokens&quot;, in game from monster battling, completing various daily missions and other grinding mechanics.

OK, well it sort of has. This new crossover actually adds customisations from 19 of Tekken 7&#x27;s characters for Virtua Fighter 5&#x27;s existing cast, so we are talking new costumes rather than any new moves. Either way though, it looks set to be a lot of chaotic fun.
You can check out the new trailer for the latest crossover below.

The video, posted to YouTube by Foulowe59, shows a montage of gameplay footage apparently filmed on Nintendo&#x27;s showfloor booth at E3 2005. 


It was there that the game was shown off in a demo reel, as part of various upcoming GameCube and Nintendo DS titles. Alas, as we now know, this Kirby never made it much further.

The culture ministry has said the video game sector is rife with English words that could be &quot;a barrier to understanding&quot; for non-gamers, writes The Guardian.



That means that pro gamer becomes &quot;joueur professionnel&quot;, and streamer becomes &quot;joueur-animateur en direct&quot;.

                              <span>June&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation Plus titles have now leaked.
Coming from reliable source Deallabs, the PlayStation Plus games for June are reportedly  God of War (2018), Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. These games will be available from 7th June until 5th July.
Some have seen the inclusion of God of War as a hint that Sony may be looking to up the marketing for its sequel, God of War: Ragnarök. After all, the game is still slated to release some time this year, and that 2022 window is rapidly getting smaller and smaller (I for one can&#x27;t believe we are nearly in June already!).

                              <span>Interesting paper by Lennart Maschmeyer: “The Subversive Trilemma: Why Cyber Operations Fall Short of Expectations“:
Abstract: Although cyber conflict has existed for thirty years, the strategic utility of cyber operations remains unclear. Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict...</span>

SHB is a small, annual, invitational workshop of people studying various aspects of the human side of security, organized each year by Alessandro Acquisti, Ross Anderson, Alice Hutchings, and myself. The forty or so attendees include psychologists, economists, computer security researchers, sociologists, political scientists, criminologists, neuroscientists, designers, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, geographers, business school professors, and a smattering of others. It’s not just an interdisciplinary event; most of the people here are individually interdisciplinary...</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re watching the new Obi-Wan Kenobi series and want yet more backstory, it sounds like you could do a lot worse than read this month&#x27;s latest Star Wars novel, Brotherhood.


Brotherhood takes place during the Clone Wars, and stars both Anakin Skywalker and Kenobi off on another adventure. But it&#x27;s the novel&#x27;s cameos which have sparked some extra attention - seeing as they acknowlege a couple of well-known video games (thanks, GamesRadar). 


For starters, Brotherhood apparently includes a &quot;blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it&quot; appearance by Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order star Cal Kestis, who was but a youngling at the time of the novel&#x27;s events.

An Activision Blizzard Benelux communications manager confirmed  the move to Dutch news site Tweakers, GamesIndustry.biz has reported, and cited &quot;the current operating conditions in these countries&quot;. Eurogamer has contacted Activision Blizzard here in the UK for comment. 


Pre-registration for the game&#x27;s mobile launch and PC beta has also now been withdrawn in both countries, it&#x27;s been claimed.

Now, one modder has gone further still, and added another handy little rune to Link&#x27;s Sheikah Slate.
The mod in question comes from sofiaharley and is dubbed the Flying Rune, or Cyclos. It basically acts like an overpowered version of Revali&#x27;s Gale, generating a wind current every time a player presses the rune button. 
&quot;Think of it like flapping your wings,&quot; explains sofiaharley. &quot;One little flap will only bring you up a little bit, but if you keep flapping you can go as high as you like!&quot;

                              <span>Fighting game fans are puzzled as to why SoulCalibur 2 HD - still available to play via Xbox 360 backwards compatibility - has become unavailable to buy on Xbox via the Microsoft Store. 


The removal was spotted over the weekend by Jon Cartwright and appears to be recent (thanks, VG247). SoulCalibur for the OG Xbox has also been delisted, it was noted, although this seems to have happened some time ago. 

SoulCalibur 2 HD now shows a &quot;not available separately&quot; message when attempting to buy the game via the Microsoft Store&#x27;s website - though it does not appear to be available elsewhere as part of any bundle - and &quot;not available at this time&quot; via Xbox consoles.

                              <span>A new fan made trailer imagines what Rare&#x27;s unreleased Banjo-Threeie could have been on the Nintendo 64 (but with vastly-improved graphics).
The trailer by Project Dream (spotted by TheGamer), proudly proclaims &quot;the adventure continues!&quot;
 This fan made threequel is set 22 years after the events of Banjo-Tooie and the defeat of Gruntilda. And, for a pretty decent period of time, everything seemed to be calm and collected for our heroes.

                              <span>Nintendo is shutting down the Pokémon DP sound library, mere months after it became available.

The sound library comprises music and sound effects from the 2006 DS games Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, launched back in February.


However, an announcement on the library page states it will shut down on 31st May. No data will be available to stream or download after this date.

                              <span>Microsoft has said it is unlikely to restore the Xbox&#x27;s &quot;Snap&quot; ability in a future update.


That&#x27;s according to Xbox engineering lead Eden Marie, who noted on Twitter that: &quot;While we all miss snap, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coming back.&quot;


Snap was a key feature - and one of the few selling points - of the Xbox One at its launch. The handy ability let you stick an app to one side of your screen while continuing to play games alongside.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has seen a record financial year, according to industry analyst Dr. Serkan Toto.



A filing in the Japanese government&#x27;s official gazette shows sales were up over 70 percent from the previous year to 204bn yen (US$1.6bn), while operating profit was at 59 billion yen (US$460m) and net profit rose 123 percent to 41bn yen (US$320m).




Of course, that&#x27;s down to some huge game releases over the fiscal year, including Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Pokémon Unite and New Pokémon Snap.

                              <span>Among the various announcements revealed this weekend as part of Star Wars Celebration, we got news of a Lego BD-1 from Respawn&#x27;s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (arguably the best thing about the game) headed our way.
The new model, which is set to release on 1st August, will have 1062 pieces, and on completion will stand at 31cm. And he won&#x27;t just be a static companion to add to your collection. Rather, he will have a head that can be &quot;tilted back, forward and sideways for maximum cuteness&quot;.
As well as the ability to pose BD-1, those who purchase their own little droid companion this summer will also get to experience other neat little inclusions, such as the back of BD-1&#x27;s head being translucent to show the droid&#x27;s mood and a display sign (see below). He probably won&#x27;t be able to heal you like he does for Cal, however.

                              <span>Artwork for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - yes, the new one - has popped up on Steam.

The discovery has fans speculating - and hoping - that this may mean that, after a seven year absence, Activision is moving away from battle.net exclusivity on PC and bringing its first-person shooter back to Valve&#x27;s PC client, Steam.

As spotted by u/Kalinine and posted to Reddit, the Modern Warfare 2 Ghost artwork &quot;show[ed] up on Steam&quot;. When pushed for clarification, the user added: &quot;it shows up at the bottom of the DLC page for some Call of duty games like Black Ops 3&quot;.

Ramiro Galan - a principal designer at Pixelkings - shared a handful of never-before-seen images on their digital portfolio, showing off what appears to be the cancelled game&#x27;s character creation screen. 

&quot;Here is a series of styles and screens by Ramiro Galan for a cancelled Marvel MMO title,&quot; the album&#x27;s description tells us. &quot;Emphasis was on rich and vibrant colours with stylistic tones that pay homage to Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse. All design, 3D materials, lighting, and post process FX were done by Ramiro Galan.&quot;

                              <span>A dataminer has uncovered further references to Ruby and her Demon Spawn secreted within Evil Dead: The Game&#x27;s files.

Ruby - who hails from Ash vs. Evil Dead - has yet to make an appearance in the main game, and her absence from the roster was a surprising omission to some given the plethora of other characters from Evil Dead stories, both old and new.

Now - thanks to a second batch of datamined voice files from our hero roster - it seems like she will indeed be making an appearance, seemingly batting for the Demons in these particular scenarios, although it&#x27;s not totally beyond the realm of possibility that she may turn up as a survivor, too - hopefully we&#x27;ll get an official reveal soon.

&quot;For us, games are more than just games.

By building a large archive of physical games, we want to preserve and tribute the games culture for a long period of time.&quot;

While newly launched, the project has already successfully archived 50,000 &quot;games, consoles, and accessories&quot; at its hub in Karlstad, Sweden, and employs a CEO, archive assistant, technical engineer, and supply manager.

                              <span>The Russian version of Gotham Knights has allegedly been cancelled.

That&#x27;s according to The Happy Warrior, which says sources at Warner Bros. Montreal have confirmed the publisher has cancelled the Russian version &quot;due to the political fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine&quot;.

The rumour is further compounded by confirmation that Gotham Knight&#x27;s Russian sub-site has been taken offline; the URL now results in a 404 error (it was still live as at 12th May, according to archive.org). Similarly, the Steam page makes no mention of Russian-language support, hinting that both Russian voicework and subtitles have been removed (thanks, VGC).

The letter - allegedly from PUBG developer Krafton - also wanted copies of PlayerIGN&#x27;s direct messages in order to decipher &quot;how [they] got said information&quot;.

                              <span>Players can now &quot;start their personal PvP quest for rewards&quot; in New World&#x27;s newest mode, Arenas.

Arenas come as part of the MMO&#x27;s latest update, which also ushers in expedition mutators, a Varangian Knights quest chain - where you can &quot;continue the story of the Varangian Knights and their conquest for power&quot; - a PvP rewards track, and &quot;a whole host of other updates&quot;.

&quot;Step into the Arena to test your skills against other combatants!&quot; Amazon explains in the game&#x27;s latest blog post. &quot;3v3 Arenas are a new small-scale PvP game mode where teams of three can face off for fame, glory, and riches. You might even win a few unique housing items.&quot;

                              <span>Change is afoot for Phasmophobia fans, and two new ghosts are on the way.

Development Preview #3 - now live for your reading pleasure on Steam, where the game is still available as an early access title - reveals what&#x27;s coming up in the next few weeks and months for the ghostbusting party game.

First up, two more ghost types are joining the spooky menagerie. The names on the reveal image have been intentionally smudged to keep us in suspense, but one says Morai or Morcai - maybe? - and the other, if you squint a bit, looks like Decogen. Or something beginning with D, anyway.

                              <span>SOC Investment Group has written an open letter to Activision Blizzard shareholders, urging voters not to re-elect six board members, including CEO, Bobby Kotick.

As spotted by GI.biz, the letter comes ahead of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s annual meeting on 21st June and campaigns to remove Bobby Kotick, Brian Kelly, Robert Morgado, Robert Corti, Barry Meyer, and Peter Nolan from their positions.

&quot;Each of these directors failed either to recognise that Activision Blizzard for years maintained unsafe workplaces exhibiting frequent and repeated sexual harassment, sexual assault, and gender discrimination, or to appropriately address the Company’s &#x27;frat house&#x27; culture once it was publicly revealed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) in its pending lawsuit, which was filed in July 2021,&quot; the damning letter states.

The early rollout is reportedly &quot;due to the nature of how mobile games rollout&quot; and will &quot;ensure a smooth launch&quot;.

                              <span>Following a flurry of recent leaks, EA has officially unveiled Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sequel. It&#x27;s called Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and will be out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC some time next year.


While there&#x27;s little in the way of specifics to accompany today&#x27;s announcement, EA has confirmed the third-person action-adventure will once again follow the story of Fallen Order protagonist Cal Kestis, albeit five years after the events of the first game.


The teaser trailer released alongside today&#x27;s announcement doesn&#x27;t reveal a whole lot more, but we do see Cal, lightsaber in hand and accompanied by trusty robot sidekick BD-1, flexing his action muscles as he remains on the run from the Empire.

Kirby 64 launched as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Switch Online + Expansion Pack retro collection last week, and players soon began reporting a bug in underwater levels - not seen in the 2000 original - that permanently stunned them after taking damage from certain sources.


In response to those reports, Nintendo has now confirmed a fix is on the way. &quot;A bug has been found in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards for Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online that can prevent players from progressing under a certain condition,&quot; it wrote in a tweet.

                              <span>Over four months after publisher Bandai Namco pulled online PvP support for the Dark Souls series on PC following the discovery of a serious security vulnerability, FromSoftware has said it&#x27;s &quot;currently in the process of restoring&quot; the games&#x27; online servers.


PvP servers for Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 were &quot;temporarily deactivated&quot; back in January after reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying that &quot;due to the time required to set up proper testing environments, online services for the Dark Souls series on PC will not resume until after the release of Elden Ring&quot;. But with Elden Ring having been out in the wild for over two months now, the Dark Souls community was steadily to lose its patience as further updates failed to materialised.

                              <span>Dino park managers looking to wow their guests with a bit more variety might want to point their attention toward Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s newly announced Dominion Biosyn DLC when it launches for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 14th June, bringing, as it does, a selection of new exhibits inspired by the latest Jurassic World movie.


Taking its cue from the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion, Frontier&#x27;s latest blob of DLC for its park management sequel ushers in a star-studded cast, new features, and, of course, new dinosaurs, amounting to what the studio is calling the game&#x27;s &quot;biggest DLC to date&quot;.


First up, there&#x27;s a new campaign that&#x27;ll task players with constructing a Research Compound in multiple stages. This features the vocal talents of Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Campbell Scott in their respective big screen roles, and brings a new feature that&#x27;ll see players unearthing rare genomes in amber mines to create feathered prehistoric species.

                              <span>Pokémon Go has detailed its next in-game season, which will take the compulsive creature-catching app through the summer months. 


Beginning on 1st June and ending on 1st September, the perhaps unimaginatively named Season of Go will be heavily punctuated by the game&#x27;s key summer event: Go Fest. 


But, happily, there&#x27;s also more going on - including the recently-confirmed arrival of Pokémon&#x27;s mysterious extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts. Today, we got our first look at the jellyfish-like Nihilego popping up - appropriately via a wormhole.

Previous patch 6.11a included numerous balance adjustments, particularly to the black mage job, in addition to removing the automatic inactive log out.


However, following negative feedback from fans, producer and director Naoki Yoshida has admitted the team got the adjustments wrong.

The one downside? You can&#x27;t use Obi-Wan&#x27;s trusty lightsaber, which instead hangs limply from his trusty Jedi backpack. 


Fortnite has previously featured lightsabers as weapons - and very fun they are too. You can strike, block and perform a neat little combat roll while holding them, and players facing off against each other will often like to go one-on-one with you as a proper duel.

This is the question Nintendo asked us in the 90s, and now we are in the future we can once again answer. What will we do? Why,we will caper of course! Yes, that&#x27;s right, Congo&#x27;s Caper is now available for you to play in the here and now. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>Yesterday, Sony announced plans for a further swathe of PlayStation game adaptations, and noted it had greenlit both a Horizon Zero Dawn series for Netflix and a God of War show for Amazon.


There was also the briefest of confirmations for a more mysterious Gran Turismo project - and now, Deadline has provided a few more details. 


For starters, Sony&#x27;s plan for Gran Turismo is to turn it into a film, though work is still &quot;in very early development&quot;. Neill Blomkamp, director of District 13, is reportedly being &quot;eyed&quot; to helm the project.

                              <span>Mobile game Plague Inc has celebrated its tenth anniversary via a Reddit Q&amp;A with creator James Vaughan.


Over 180 million people have played the game since its release in May 2012, with a spike following the Covid-19 outbreak.


Asked how big the uptick in players had been since the pandemic, Vaughan replied: &quot;Interestingly, Plague Inc has always got more popular whenever people get ill, eg When Plague Inc was #1 in Japan - we saw big spikes every time there was a bad flu outbreak. When Ebola was spreading in 2015, we saw a big worldwide spike in players. When Covid first started though we saw the biggest increase in players ever - it lasted for about a month and then went back down to normal levels.

                              <span>Microsoft will take longer to launch its planned Xbox cloud streaming box, and said it has decided to &quot;pivot away&quot; from the device&#x27;s current iteration.


While the device, codenamed Keystone, has never formally been shown, earlier leaks pointed to a mini box similar to a shrunk down Xbox Series S, which acted as a hub for Ethernet, USB and HDMI ports.


Xbox&#x27;s plan - which still seems to be in place, albeit no longer in the immediate future - is to launch Keystone as a small gadget capable of streaming Xbox Game Pass titles to any monitor or TV screen with no extra console hardware required.

                              <span>Another round of layoffs has hit embattled Mafia 3 studio Hangar 13, with around 50 people affected. 


It follows an earlier round of job losses last November, when 200 positions were at risk, and the departure of the studio&#x27;s head Haden Blackman earlier this month.


These latest job losses will affect Hangar 13&#x27;s main location in California, Kotaku reported. Staff were informed remotely by Hangar 13&#x27;s new boss Nick Baynes, who ran the company&#x27;s Brighton location before succeeding Blackman as overall company head.

As well as updating this feature, users will now also get a message letting them know when their Deck is running out of space. A notification will pop up when there is less than 2GB of space remaining.

That included having players inside robots designed to look like burgers, bears, skulls, and more.

                              <span>Gotham Knights&#x27; development team has addressed the recent criticism surrounding its depiction of Barbara Gordon.
During a recent Q&amp;A, fans asked more about the development of Barbara, aka Batgirl. This was following a backlash to her character&#x27;s biography on the game&#x27;s website, which described her as training to &quot;recover from her wounds&quot; so that she could &quot;return to active duty as Batgirl&quot;.
In the comic books, Barbara Gordon is shot in the spine by Joker, leading to her using a wheelchair. While she may not have the exact same backstory in Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. previously stated Barbara was in a wheelchair following a &quot;face-off&quot;.

                              <span>Ever since its unveiling in 2020, Dead Space creator Glen Schofield&#x27;s sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol has conjured images of Dead Space, so it was a bit of a surprise when, due to various studio connections, it was announced the game would be set in the PUBG Universe. That, however, is no longer the case, with Schofield now saying it&#x27;s its &quot;own story and world&quot;.


The Callisto Protocol is a third-person horror game set in 2320, with its action unfolding within the confines of the Black Iron prison colony on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto. While that set-up mightn&#x27;t immediately scream PUBG to onlookers, the connection came from the fact developer Striking Distance was explicitly established by PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton to create narrative-driven games that would expand the universe introduced in the battle royale hit.

                              <span>Legendary actor Ray Liotta, who made a memorable impact on the world of gaming as the voice of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City protagonist Tommy Vercetti in 2002, has died aged 67.


Although Liotta only ever starred in one other game - Call of Duty: Black Ops 2&#x27;s DLC pack Mob of the Dead in 2013 - the actor had a long, enormously prolific career in both film and television, appearing in wide variety of productions, ranging from beloved baseball movie Field of Dreams to ER, and, more recently, Apple&#x27;s psychological thriller Black Bird.


Arguably his most iconic role, though, remains his 1990 breakthrough performance in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s movie classic Goodfellas, where he starred as real-life mobster Henry Hill alongside the likes of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.

                              <span>Minecraft&#x27;s long-awaited The Wild Update - which includes two new biomes, new mobs, and various other delights - finally has a release date, and will be launching on 7th June.


The Wild Update&#x27;s first major addition comes in the form of the new Mangrove Swamp biome, bringing mangrove trees and a new natural (and craftable) resource known as mud blocks. It also ushers in the highly anticipated Deep Dark biome, which was originally due to launch as part of the Caves &amp; Cliffs update before getting delayed.


The Deep Dark biome, as its name very much implies, is Minecraft&#x27;s deepest area to date, and is found beneath the game&#x27;s current bedrock layer. Here, curious adventures will uncover remnants of a ruined civilisation as well as creepy, eyeless mobs known as Wardens. These fearsome foes react to vibrations, meaning stealth is the key to survival, and can also be summoned if careless explorers stumble into the new Shrieker traps.

                              <span>Budding urban planners that somehow still haven&#x27;t found their way toward Colossal Order&#x27;s enormously entertaining city builder Cities: Skylines now have no excuse. You can pick up the base game and almost all its DLC on PC for around £16 in the latest Humble charity bundle.


Cities: Skylines was a solidly entertaining city builder when it released all the way back in 2015, but seven years of expansions and other post-launch DLC haved created a game of truly amazing scope. However, getting your hands on absolutely everything that&#x27;s released thus far is, inevitably, an extremely pricey undertaking even during sale season.


Hop over to the Humble Store right now though, and you can pick up publisher Paradox Interactive&#x27;s Cities: Skylines Colossal Collection. This features a total of 32 items (usually costing £204.39), including the base game, plus its After Dark, Snowfall, Natural Disasters, Mass Transit, Green Cities, Parklife, Industries, Campus, and Sunset Harbour expansions.

                              <span>As part of its latest earnings report, CD Projekt has offered an revised breakdown of the projects currently occupying the studio&#x27;s time, confirming the &quot;bulk of&quot; its development capacity is now focused on Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s story expansion, which is still expected to launch next year.


Following Cyberpunk&#x27;s disastrous release at the tail-end of 2020, the majority of CD Projekt&#x27;s development resources (as shown in the chart below) were focused on remedying the game&#x27;s most pressing issues. At the same time, a smaller team was working on its next-gen release, promised long before the project&#x27;s launch woes, and an even smaller group was doing preliminary work on its paid expansion.


Inevitably, those numbers have shifted considerably over time - less than half of CD Projekt&#x27;s development staff were working on Cyberpunk&#x27;s base game and next-gen update by June last year, for instance - and that trend has, unsurprisingly, continued. As per today&#x27;s financial results, Cyberpunk 2077 support has &quot;shrunk considerably&quot; following the release of its next-gen update (which CD Projekt says had &quot;a positive effect on the game&#x27;s perception and sales figures&quot;), with the &quot;bulk of [the studio&#x27;s] development capacity&quot; now working on its expansion.

                              <span>Following some extended gameplay earlier this month, the developers behind Gotham Knights have given more of an insight into the designs of Nightwing&#x27;s glider and Red Hood&#x27;s (somewhat surprising) mystic leap.
During a Q&amp;A on the Gotham Knights Discord, creative director Patrick Redding revealed Nightwing&#x27;s Flying Trapeze was inspired by &quot;a couple of ideas&quot; including some classic issues in the Nightwing solo book that saw the DC hero using his &quot;aerialist moves with jet-powered gliders&quot;.
Additionally, the team wanted it to feel as though Nightwing had been through the late, great, Batman&#x27;s arsenal.

Speaking to Xbox Wire Japan (translated by IGN), Miyazaki discussed development of the game&#x27;s world and key inspirations.


&quot;Our first step when designing the map was to decide where the bosses would appear, especially the important ones,&quot; said Miyazaki. &quot;Therefore, the map was really designed on the basis of boss gameplay, then we adjusted the boss gameplay based on their location on the map.&quot;

A reddit post advertising the protest, which is supported by numerous high-profile TF2 content creators, now sits at the top of the TF2 subreddit, with more than 2000 comments and an eye-catching 1000 reddit (paid-for) awards.


The protest aims to get #SaveTF2 trending worldwide on Twitter and other social media today, 26th May, from 6pm UK time. Success, the protest&#x27;s organisers say, means showing how the aging game still retains its popularity.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive has revealed its new mobile game Jurassic World Primal Ops.


The free-to-play action-adventure game has players as handlers aiming for peace between humans and dinosaurs (will they ever learn?). Players will use their combat skills to save dinosaurs from enemies and then fight alongside them. 


The trailer below shows plenty of combat, as well as a nice variety of dinosaurs to acquire. Gotta catch &#x27;em all, I suppose.

                              <span>Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé has shared a damning verdict of the games industry&#x27;s lack of progress in diversity. 


Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz as part of his book tour, Fils-Aimé argues that the games industry is &quot;woefully behind&quot; in embracing diversity. 


&quot;You don&#x27;t see it in the executive ranks, you don&#x27;t see it in the leadership ranks of key developers. It&#x27;s incredibly difficult to find it in various games,&quot; he points out.

                              <span>An Elden Ring player has managed to defeat every boss in the game in just one hit.


Twitch streamer BushyGames has released a YouTube video explaining his build and methodology - and, of course, including the boss battles themselves.


For the challenge, he gave himself free reign on strategies, abilities, and weapons, but only one attack per enemy or per boss phase (for those with multiple phases) was allowed. The (arguably overpowered) sorcery Comet Azur was also not allowed.

                              <span>Fortnite has now confirmed its next live event, dubbed Collision, will take place on Saturday 4th June at 9pm UK time. As ever, this is a one-time only affair - if you miss out, well, you&#x27;ll just have to watch a recap on YouTube.
As the culmination of this season&#x27;s all-out war, Collision will mark the return of Fortnite&#x27;s fan-favourite bear Mech, the unmasking of its pilot as the game&#x27;s final member of the Seven, and an explosive showdown with the Island&#x27;s villainous IO faction. 
If all that means nothing to you, just know that these events are typically spectacular showcases for Epic&#x27;s development flair - oh, and there will be some freebies (and paid-for bits) to commemorate the occaison in Fortnite&#x27;s item shop in the run up to and including that day.

Supermassive states the reason for this delay is to ensure that it delivers &quot;the best possible experience&quot; to players on its eventual release.

Heading the line up is Far Cry 4, which sees players taking on the role of Ajay Ghale as he becomes caught up in a civil war in the fictional Kyrat. 
Meanwhile, users will also have the chance to jet off to the tropical shores of Mêlée this month, thanks to the arrival of Escape from Monkey Island. This a timely addition to the service, with the sixth game in the Monkey Island series (the appropriately-named Return to Monkey Island) due to release some time this year.

That decision, if made, would plunge a swathe of US states into a situation where legal abortion was once again largely unavailable - and it&#x27;s a situation several US-based game companies have spoken out about. 


EA, as with the majority of companies, has not. Nor has it publicly made a specific statement on legal issues threatening transgender rights, which are ongoing in several states. Now, speaking via a town hall meeting leaked to Kotaku, its chief people officer Mala Singh was asked why.

The game received an open demo in October 2020 but little has been heard since.

                              <span>It looks like PS5 exclusive Returnal may be heading to PC.


Details for Housemarque&#x27;s BAFTA winning sci-fi roguelike have been spotted on SteamDB, including references to its Tower of Sisyphus DLC, Selene&#x27;s ship Helios, and the alien planet of Atropos.



Returnal would follow the likes of God of War earlier this year, as well as Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn as previous console exclusives arriving on PC.

Existing owners of the game on Humble and Steam should be able to download the game on Mac and Linux under the existing ownership (Xbox Game Pass isn&#x27;t supported on those platforms).

                              <span>A new report has called out Microsoft executives (both former and current) for their poor behaviour towards staff, including instances of verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 
Insider (via Windows Central) reported that Microsoft&#x27;s Alex Kipman, Terry Myerson and Tom Keane have all been accused of creating a toxic workplace environment during their time with the company.
Most notably, and incredibly disturbingly, Kipman (who currently oversees Microsoft&#x27;s metaverse efforts) is reported to have watched inappropriate footage via a VR headset, which was then projected onto an external screen, while in room full of his colleagues.

                              <span>A Horizon Zero Dawn TV project is in the works for Netflix, Sony has announced. 


In a new presentation to investors, Sony also said it had a God of War TV show in development for Amazon, and a further Gran Turismo pitch it was also working on.

There&#x27;s no word on plot details for Horizon - or any of the above projects - or word on when we might see them materialise. Still, hopefully someone at Sony is talking to Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie right now and asking about her availability.

Resistance: Retribution was Bend Studio&#x27;s third-person PSP prequel to the Resistance series. As Gematsu writes, The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea have rated the game for current consoles.


PSP games will be available to Premium subscribers, though only a couple have been officially announced so far: Super Stardust Portable and Ridge Racer 2 (in Asia).

Sad Cat Studios has a team of developers based both in Belarus and Ukraine. 


&quot;The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families. As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced,&quot; the studio wrote in a tweet.

That would take its current slate of live service games to three, following the release of MLB The Show 22 and its Diamond Dynasty mode.


What&#x27;s more, by 2025 it&#x27;s projected to release a total of 12 live service franchises (six by 2023 and ten by 2024).

Additionally, it expects to make a tidy $300m on PC games alone this fiscal year (which ends March 2023).
Needless to say, these are some quite impressive figures that Sony has put out there.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s initial rollout of Sony&#x27;s new PlayStation Plus - limited, so far, to countries in Asia - has been plagued by complaints from fans who stacked subscriptions ahead of time and unexpectedly found Sony wanted them to cough up the difference when converting their membership to its new tiers.


Numerous users reported via social media that they had been told they would have to pay up for any difference in pricing - achieved via stacking or from redeeming discounted PlayStation Plus offers - for the full term of their remaining subscription balance. It was a situation that left some with eye-opening charges to suddenly cough up.


Now, following general confusion and a good deal of online backlash, Sony has finally acknowledged the situation and termed it as a &quot;technical error&quot; which &quot;has been fixed&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has announced that its upcoming PlayStation VR2 will have over 20 first-party and third-party games available at launch.


The announcement was made today in a business briefing by Sony on its &quot;Game and Network Services Segment.&quot; 


Speaking to investors in a briefing call, PlayStation chief Jim Ryan said, &quot;Right now, there is a considerable amount of money being spent on partnerships with independent and other third-party developers to secure a considerable pipeline of attractive VR content at the launch of PlayStation VR2,&quot; (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>The PlayStation 5&#x27;s sales momentum - currently held back by stock shortages - will finally overtake the PS4&#x27;s equivalent selling speed by 2024.


In a financial presentation last night, Sony exec Jim Ryan noted that, despite a strong launch, PS5 sales were lagging behind PS4 in its equivalent second year owing to supply constraints.


Those supply constraints are due to both the Covid pandemic and Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, but remain a top priority for Sony.

                              <span>June is almost upon us, and for motorsport fans thoughts are turning to some public roads in the centre of France that will soon be closed off for the greatest race of them all. It&#x27;s Le Mans month! And what better way to whet your appetite than by taking to the wheel of the winner of last year&#x27;s race, Toyota&#x27;s GR010 hypercar which today makes its video game debut in Gran Turismo 7 thanks to its latest update. 


Oh, there are some other cars too - namely a new GT Vision Suzuki and an outrageous beefed up Camaro going under the Roadster Shop Rampage name. They come alongside some new Scapes in New Orleans to snap your cars - and once you&#x27;re done admiring the new cars you can take part in the Gran Turismo World Series which is kicking off in Gran Turismo 7 this weekend, with the preliminary rounds open to all-comers taking place on 27th May and 28th May. 


The World Series grand finale will be returning to a real life event in Monte Carlo this November - a fitting backdrop for what&#x27;s become one of the glitziest online racing competitions in recent years, and one that&#x27;s delivered some decent action too.

But by all accounts, the potential attack surface here is enormous, as many federal employees clearly will purchase these readers from a myriad of online vendors when the need arises. Saicoo’s product listings, for example, are replete with comments from customers who self-state that they work at a federal agency (and several who reported problems installing drivers).</span>

                              <span>Developer IronOak Games&#x27; wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure For The King is getting a sequel, and it&#x27;ll be making its way to PC some time next year.


The original For The King, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was a thoroughly entertaining (if sometimes brutally challenging) blend of familiar RPG stables - think dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - streamlined into a light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure.


More than anything, it was a wonderfully designed little story generator - encompassing everything from haunted carnivals to suffocating jungles - with enough potential combinations across its moving parts to feel sufficiently different each run.

                              <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator&#x27;s free Top Gun: Maverick expansion has remained something of a mystery since its announcement last June, but now, with the update finally here on Xbox and PC, developer Asobo has detailed exactly what to expect when it&#x27;s fired up for the first time.


One notable oddity of the Top Gun expansion is that it&#x27;ll be launching without what&#x27;s arguably its biggest feature: the F/A-18E Super Hornet. However, that&#x27;s only because Asobo made the decision to release the plane early as part of last year&#x27;s free Game of the Year Edition update when the expansion was delayed alongside the Top Gun: Maverick movie.


Even without the plane as its flagship addition, though, there&#x27;s still plenty for simmers to grapple with, starting with three training missions for the F/A-18E, all designed to help pilots master &quot;radical flight maneuvers including unrestricted take-offs, split S maneuvers, and low altitude, high-speed maneuvering through complex terrain.&quot;

                              <span>Northgard developer Shiro Games&#x27; sci-fi strategy title Dune: Spice Wars generated plenty of praise when it launched into Steam early access toward the end of last month, and now, as the studio starts to build on that initial success, publisher Funcom has shared an initial development roadmap promising the likes of multiplayer, spaceports, and more to come.


First up in terms of major new features is multiplayer, currently scheduled to arrive some time this &quot;summer&quot;. Details are scarce at this juncture, but Funcom&#x27;s roadmap makes reference to both co-op play and &quot;free-for-all&quot; PvP, with up to four players supported at one time.


Also due this summer is a brand-new faction, but specifics are even more limited in this case. All we&#x27;re getting for the time being is the tease of a suitably mysterious silhouette and a note that the faction will include a &quot;new victory condition&quot;.

                              <span>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 has now passed the 1m sales milestone, publisher CI Games has announced.


Released last June as the sixth game in the Sniper Ghost Warrior series, this latest entry hit the 1m sales mark in a little under 12 months. The franchise as a whole has now passed 13m sales, CI also noted.


Generally speaking, the Sniper Ghost Warrior series has recently grown in quality after some earlier stumbles - in particular the series&#x27; attempt at going open world with Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 which CI itself said had been &quot;too ambitious&quot;.

The app, which is set to launch this summer, will also plug into other Niantic games such as Ingress.

                              <span>Barely a month has gone by since the arrival of No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s major Outlaws update, which gave intergalactic explorers the opportunity to live out their pirate fantasies, but already Hello Games is back - this time with a brand-new expedition that finally answers fan pleas to add space whales (of a sort) to the exploratory sim.
Expeditions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, are effectively No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle its various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. And today&#x27;s addition, titled Leviathan, is a very different proposition to April&#x27;s The Blighted, and sounds considerably more ambitious - and significantly weirder - than any of the expeditions we&#x27;ve seen before. 
That said, Leviathan begins in much the same way as previous expeditions, dropping all players into one location. However, what follows is something closer to a roguelike experience, stripping explorers of their progress whenever they die. The narrative twist, though, is that players are actually stuck in a mysterious time loop, and the entire community will need to work together to find a way to break free.

                              <span>Get your fists (and I suppose more importantly, your fingers) ready, as Streets of Rage 4 is now available on mobile. 
As you&#x27;d expect from the Streets of Rage series, the game promises plenty of chaos, with 17 iconic characters and new fighting mechanics included.
Its release on Android and iOS is marked by this brand-new trailer. It&#x27;s laced with nostalgia, with the perfect synthwave backing track to get your blood pumping. You can check it out for yourself below.

 In short, it&#x27;s a free-to-play first-person PvPvE extraction shooter set on an alien planet were a radioactive storm has wiped out most of the population.

                              <span>Dream Daddy developer Game Grumps has a new psychological horror game in the works called Homebody.


Inspired by classic slasher films of the 1980s, it&#x27;s a narrative-driven game that sees you escaping a house by solving puzzles, making dialogue decisions, and avoiding the killer.


That&#x27;s an impossible feat at first, but repeated attempts at escape will put all the pieces together. And judging by the trailer below, its low-fi graphics only add to the horrifying atmosphere.

&quot;We&#x27;re so excited for Starfield we couldn&#x27;t help but imagine this upcoming game in Unreal,&quot; the team shared on their YouTube channel (Enfant Terrible).
The footage may only be short, but it is absolutely gorgeous and packed with swelling music and sprawling, otherworldly, vistas. Enfant Terrible created this trailer (of sorts) by using &quot;footage from different Unreal Engine 5 reels and projects&quot; to imagine how Bethesda&#x27;s &quot;Space Opera&quot; could look on its release.

Currently, if a streamer is suspended or banned, they receive a notification that explains which rule has been broken but without further detail.


That leaves some streamers unaware of what behaviour broke the rules, or they can feign ignorance.

EG7 went on to reveal it had originally planned to invest more than SEK 500m (£40m) in this project over the coming few years.

                              <span>A new staff group within Activision Blizzard has been formed to fight for worker rights. 


The Worker Committee Against Sex and Gender Discrimination has been founded by 12 current and former staff members, including high-profile ABetterABK member Jessica Gonzalez, and has presented a list of demands to embattled boss Bobby Kotick, The Washington Post reported.


Issues raised include improvements to private breastfeeding areas, an end to undocumented meetings with HR, improved support for transgender employees, two weeks extra paid time off for parental leave (up to 12 weeks), and the need for independent investigations into allegations of discrimination.

                              <span>PS Plus subscribers in Asia have spotted artwork for PS1 classic Dino Crisis, suggesting it could be added to the service soon.


Currently, the game is not included in the catalogue, which - judging by its Asian launch this week - has fewer games than expected.



However, users in Asia have spotted artwork of the lead character from Dino Crisis used as the cover for classic games, suggesting it could be added soon.

                              <span>With Sony&#x27;s new look PlayStation subscription service now in full swing in Asia, we are getting more and more snippets of information about what it actually offers. This includes a closer look at some of the game trials that are available through the service. However, this feature is not going to take a one size (or length) fits all approach. 
As noticed by PSVortex, games such as Horizon: Forbidden West and Cyberpunk 2077 will have trials lasting five hours, which seems a fairly generous offering.
Meanwhile, other titles such as the recently released Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and WWE 2K22, only offer trials for two hours.

                              <span>The Witcher School live-action role-play events in Poland, one of which I attended in 2016, have come to an end because of a contractual termination by CD Projekt Red over use of The Witcher name. The exact reasons why are potentially political but also unclear.
5 Żywiołów (5 Elements), the company behind the events, alleges that CD Projekt Red pulled the licence because of a staff member&#x27;s involvement with the ultra-conservative Polish Catholic organisation Ordo Iuris, which is anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+, and rejects the idea of gender equality.
The staff member in question, Ania Wawrzyniak, is the wife of 5 Żywiołów founder Dastin Wawrzyniak. And according to a Facebook post co-signed by brothers Dastin and Dominic Wawrzyniak, Ania worked as a lawyer for the company for around two years (between 2017 and 2019, they later specified).

                              <span>Yet another adversarial ML attack:
Most deep neural networks are trained by stochastic gradient descent. Now “stochastic” is a fancy Greek word for “random”; it means that the training data are fed into the model in random order.
So what happens if the bad guys can cause the order to be not random? You guessed it—all bets are off. Suppose for example a company or a country wanted to have a credit-scoring system that’s secretly sexist, but still be able to pretend that its training was actually fair. Well, they could assemble a set of financial data that was representative of the whole population, but start the model’s training on ten rich men and ten poor women drawn from that set ­ then let initialisation bias do the rest of the work...</span>

The Structured Logging Working
Group
has added new capabilities to the logging infrastructure in Kubernetes
1.24. This blog post explains how developers can take advantage of those to
make log output more useful and how they can get involved with improving Kubernetes.
Structured logging
The goal of structured
logging
is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log
entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters
separately, for example as a JSON struct.
When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls,
strings were originally printed with \n escape sequences, except when
embedded inside a struct. For structs, log entries could still span multiple
lines, with no clean way to spl…</span>

                              <span>Temtem, developer Crema&#x27;s massively multiplayer riff on Pokémon, will be leaving early access and getting its full PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 6th September.


Temtem, you might recall, entered Steam early access back in January 2020, selling over half a million copies in its first month of release. Crema has been steadily expanded the game&#x27;s core creature-collecting and battling action since then - introducing the likes of new Temtem, new islands to explore, and new social and competitive features, not to mention launching an early access version for PS5 - and update 1.0 is now finally in sight.


After more than two years in early access, Temtem is already pretty feature rich, with its pre-release version including the bulk of its story campaign across the Airborne Archipelago, well over 100 Temtem to catch, co-op play, competitive multiplayer, clans, housing, trading, and tournaments. However, its final release promises a number of new additions.

                              <span>The Sims 4&#x27;s long-awaited customisable pronouns feature has finally arrived - albeit in English only to begin with - and is available now as part of the game&#x27;s latest update.


Developer Maxis confirmed it was investigating ways to introduce expanded pronoun options to The Sims 4 last May - following a community petition signed by more than 22,000 people - and players got a first look at the feature&#x27;s progress during a livestream earlier this year.


And now, with some additional development time under its belt, Maxis has pushed the first iteration of its customisable pronouns feature - developed in conjunction with LGBTQ+ nonprofit organisations It Gets Better and GLAAD - live, delivering what it calls a further step &quot;in the direction of a more inclusive experience for Simmers&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Infinity Ward&#x27;s next instalment in the long-running Call of Duty series, which was previously confirmed to be near-future sequel Modern Warfare 2 (not to be confused with the 2009 game of the same name), will launch on 28th October. Platforms have yet to be detailed.


Activision Blizzard formally revealed Modern Warfare 2 and its logo in April - after months of rumours and even an official pre-announcement announcement in February.


Following today&#x27;s release date confirmation, specifics remain extremely light, but the gameplay-free trailer accompanying Activision Blizzard&#x27;s announcement does include a description revealing a smidgeon more of what&#x27;s in store.

                              <span>Battlefield is as famous for its troubled launches as it is its sandbox multiplayer, but even by its own standards 2042 has been something of a disaster - lumpy, incomplete and with some less than popular decisions along the way such as the expansive maps designed to accommodate the newly expanded 128 player count and the introduction of specialists. 


DICE at least does have some previous in turning around a shaky ship - Battlefield 4 went from a disastrous launch to become one of the most celebrated in the series - and is making the right noises ahead of the belated launch of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s first season next month. 


While we&#x27;re not yet privy to the full reveal, a discussion between creative director Lars Gustavsson, senior producer Ryan McArthur and community manager Freeman outlined the studio&#x27;s commitment to Battlefield 2042 - interesting itself in light of comments made by EA boss Andrew Wilson to investors earlier this month that suggested development on the series is being rethought - as well as what changes to expect.

Constructing the new armory hut will let you show off up to five loadouts and easily swap between them via the game&#x27;s main menu, so you can build gear for specific situations and shuffle amongst them on the fly. 


It&#x27;s a handy feature which was also added post-launch to Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey, Valhalla&#x27;s predecessor, and no doubt will also encourage a few people to go splash out further on some of this game&#x27;s flashier cosmetic armour sets. Here&#x27;s how it looks:

The function was included last year to ease congestion in the ever-popular MMORPG, as players complained about long queue times due to overloaded servers.



However, its removal in this latest patch suggests that congestion is finally easing.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild may be well over five years old now, but its community is still uncovering charming little details that have been tucked away by Nintendo. One such find has recently surfaced, and it involves the final memory Link uncovers towards the game&#x27;s close.
Those who have played through Breath of the Wild will know that Link slowly starts to regain his memories of the events before and during the Great Calamity as the game progresses (of course, this being Breath of the Wild, you could also blast through without collecting a single one of these memories if facing off against Ganon with the bare essentials is more your thing). 
The final memory can only be discovered when players have collected the 12 others scattered across Hyrule and cannot be happened upon by accident (which incidentally is how I found most of them - my geographical recognition was pretty poor during my first playthrough).

The Metal Gear Solid spin-off from Platinum Games was first released in 2013 on PS3 and Xbox 360 (with a PC release in 2014), but has recently seen a rise of 1000 percent in its average concurrent Steam players.


That&#x27;s been put down by some to the recent popularity of the Jetstream Sam meme, spotted by IGN.

A Nintendo Switch launch will follow later this year, although there&#x27;s no exact date for this as yet.


&quot;The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, based on the legendary The Lord of the Rings trilogy of books by JRR Tolkien, tells of Gollum&#x27;s experiences from behind-the-scenes in the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; writes  Daedalic. &quot;After losing his precious ring to Bilbo Baggins, Gollum decides to leave the Misty Mountains and embark on a perilous journey that leads him from the dungeons of Barad-dûr to the realm of the Wood-elves in Mirkwood.   

&quot;In order to survive the dangers of his journey through Middle-earth, Gollum has to sneak and climb and use all his cunning.&quot;  As part of a hands-off preview last week, I got to see some of this cunning in action.

The below teaser shows Nihilego, a Rock/Poison-type which looks like a big space jellyfish. It&#x27;s actually one of the more normal-looking Ultra Beasts, which were specifically designed to appear alien in the traditional Pokémon world.


We also get a glimpse of a figure dressed in the uniform of the Ultra Recon Squad. Will these be new PVE enemies in the game&#x27;s overworld? Or is this just a snazzy outfit for your avatar to wear? Here&#x27;s a look:

                              <span>A new listing on the Xbox store has revealed the existence of a multiplayer &quot;standalone DLC&quot; for the Destroy All Humans! series known as Clone Carnage.
The sales page reveals the game will have six new maps for players to frolic around in, as well as four new modes – Rampage, Armageddon, Race and Abduction (via ResetEra).
Clone Carnage will seemingly support up to four-player multiplayer, or a local two-player multiplayer option with split screen gameplay. Additionally, it will support cross-gen play (at least on Xbox consoles) and have 4K Ultra HD.

The deal was first announced back in January, when it was briefly the most expensive video games acquisition of all time - until Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.


Take-Two is the company behind some of video gaming&#x27;s biggest names, such as Borderlands and Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, BioShock and Mafia.

The game celebrates its tenth anniversary this May. Reads the website: &quot;Thank you, Arisen, for taking up arms and braving through the impossible challenges laid ahead of you. We are forever grateful for your support throughout the years and hope you will join us in this momentous celebration of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma!&quot;


But why would Capcom go to such an effort for this game in particular?

The hugely-popular social app is conducting tests with in-app games in Vietnam, Reuters has said. 


In response, Tiktok confirmed the gaming push, and said it was currently looking at bringing HTML5 games to its app from third-party pubishers such as Zynga.

Publisher Square Enix had originally planned each season to last three months, but now that&#x27;s been doubled. &quot;Based on the feedback we have received from our players, we feel that we need a period to re-evaluate the game&#x27;s future operating roadmap&quot;, according to a blog post from last Friday.


&quot;Season 2 will include the Ver. 1.2.1 small-scale update, but after that we will be using the extra three months of the season extension for development on the next update, and so will not be making any further updates or adding new content during that time.

Now, the duo are returning to the series in the aptly named Return to Monkey Island and in the run up to its release have revealed the one puzzle they regret from their original time working on the series. 
Chatting to GamesBeat, Gilbert and Grossman revealed the Monkey Wrench puzzle from LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge, which saw Guybrush Threepwood using an actual monkey to activate a seemingly broken pump, was a mistake, calling it &quot;notoriously unsolvable&quot; and &quot;not a good design on several levels&quot;. 
&quot;Even if you are an English speaker from a location where the tool in question is commonly called a &#x27;monkey wrench,&#x27; and you realise that that&#x27;s what you need, you still have to make an astonishing predictive leap about how your actions will create that tool,&quot; said Grossman. &quot;Nothing in the game sets any of it up adequately.&quot;

Blaidd, for the unaware, is an NPC in FromSoftware&#x27;s epic who&#x27;s half man and half wolf. He&#x27;s involved in one of the game&#x27;s main quests, helps players with one of the major bosses, and has had the furry community in a frenzy.


Welsh voice actor Arthur admits it too. &quot;I know that he&#x27;s caused quite a stir in the furry world, which I didn&#x27;t know anything about until I looked on the internet,&quot; he says at the start.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s revamped PlayStation Plus subscription has now begun rolling out worldwide, and is available first in Asia from today. 


The launch gives us our first proper look at the service&#x27;s full catalogue of games - although fans say it contains far fewer titles in its catalogue than previously expected. 


Indeed, a guide to PlayStation Plus published yesterday on the PlayStation blog mentions &quot;700&quot; games available across the subscription&#x27;s various plans - a rough figure we&#x27;ve heard from Sony before - albeit with the caveat that these games will vary &quot;over time and plan&quot;.

                              <span>It appears that Sony is using the PAL version of PS1 classics in its PS Plus subscription.


The subscription has now launched in Asia, but - as spotted by VGC - some PS1 games are using the PAL (Europe, Australia, New Zealand) version instead of the NTSC (Asia, America).


That means they&#x27;re presented in 50Hz instead of 60Hz, resulting in a lower refresh rate and therefore lower framerates.

                              <span>Following a recent Supreme Court ruling, the Justice Department will no longer prosecute “good faith” security researchers with cybercrimes:
The policy for the first time directs that good-faith security research should not be charged. Good faith security research means accessing a computer solely for purposes of good-faith testing, investigation, and/or correction of a security flaw or vulnerability, where such activity is carried out in a manner designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public, and where the information derived from the activity is used primarily to promote the security or safety of the class of devices, machines, or online services to which the accessed computer belongs, or those who use such devices, machines, or online services...</span>

                              <span>A group of 28 QA testers at Activision Blizzard&#x27;s Wisconsin-based Raven Software studio have, despite the publisher&#x27;s ongoing anti-unionisation efforts, won their vote to unionise.


Quality Assurance testers at Raven Software formally announced their intent to unionise under the name Game Workers Alliance in January - amid then-ongoing strike action following the firing of 12 members of the developer&#x27;s QA team - but when Activision Blizzard missed a deadline to voluntarily recognise the union, the group filed a petition with independent government agency the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to initiate a union election.


Activision Blizzard contested the filing, but its arguments were rejected by NLRB, whereupon the publisher was reportedly began ramping up its anti-unionisation efforts.

                              <span>As Sony&#x27;s revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service goes live across Asian markets, more and more previously unknown details are beginning to emerge, including the news that Syphon Filter won&#x27;t be the only classic PS1 title getting trophy support at launch.


When Sony Bend Studio shared word of Syphon Filter&#x27;s new trophies last week, it didn&#x27;t confirm whether other PS1 titles would be getting a similar treatment as part of Sony&#x27;s revised PlayStation Plus - but with the service now going live, that question has been answered.


Achievement tracking website Exophase has revealed trophy lists for four more PS1 games alongside the previously announced Syphon Filter: I.Q. Intelligent Qube, Hot Shots Golf, Ape Escape, and Wild Arms (which, notably, wasn&#x27;t on Sony&#x27;s previous list of PS Plus inclusions).

                              <span>Former PlayStation employee Emma Majo has launched a new gender discrimination lawsuit against PlayStation after an initial attempt was dismissed by a federal judge in April.


Majo, an ex-PlayStation IT analyst, initially filed a suit against the company last November, claiming, among other things, that PlayStation paid women less than men in similar jobs, that women were denied promotions, and that she was wrongfully fired &quot;soon after&quot; submitting a signed statement to Sony in 2021 detailing the alleged gender bias she had experienced.


Those initial claims were supported by a raft of new allegations in March, when eight more PlayStation employees, past and present, submitted statements alleging sexual harassment, bullying, gender bias, and an inability to properly investigate these issues at the company.

On Nintendo’s Customer Support page regarding the upcoming closure of the Wii U and 3DS eshops to new purchases, it states: &quot;As of May 23, 2022, it will no longer be possible to use a credit card to add funds to an account in Nintendo eShop on Wii U or the Nintendo 3DS family of systems.&quot;
Eurogamer checked earlier, and at the time of writing you could still add funds with a credit card through a Nintendo account, so you have time to get yourself topped up if this is your preferred method.

                              <span>Sony has begun the rollout of its new look PlayStation Plus subscription service, with Asian markets being given the green for go from 24th May. And, along with this new beginning, some more games have been made available on the PlayStation store.
These games include the PlayStation 1 title Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Oddysee (which is retailed at RM 20.00, so about four pounds) and the PSP game Ridge Racer 2 (via ResetEra).
The sales page for Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Oddysee has revealed the game will now have newly added features, including &quot;up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters.&quot;

                              <span>Tropical adventure Tchia has been delayed until early 2023.


The last we saw of the game was at The Game Awards last year. It was originally set for a spring 2022 launch across PS4, PS5, and PC (Epic).


&quot;This extra time will allow us to really polish every aspect of the game and flesh out all the little details that we know will make Tchia a really special experience,&quot; said the developers in a Twitter post.

                              <span>Horizon Forbidden West is back at the top of the UK physical charts three months after its release.


Sales of the game rose 94 percent week-on-week, largely thanks to a new PS5 bundle that includes the game with the console.


Fresh console stock also means other PS5 games have leapt into the charts: Gran Turismo 7 is back up to tenth place with a 38 percent sales rise, while Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart re-enters at 15 with a 275 percent sales rise (thanks GamesIndustry.biz).

An announcement on the Japanese Pac-Man website says that the collaboration between  Fortnite and Pac-Man will start from 2nd June.
From then, players will be able to purchase items with a &#x27;Pac-Man&#x27; motif. So, perhaps we won&#x27;t be seeing entire Pac-Man skins gobbling their way through Fortnite&#x27;s map next month, but time will tell.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s revamped PS Plus subscription service launches in Asia this week and new details are already emerging.


It&#x27;s been revealed that various visual options for PS1 games will be available, including multiple resolutions (native, 4:3 for 16:9, and stretched) as well as three filters: default, retro classic, and modern. 


Retro classic is essentially a CRT filter, meaning it&#x27;s replicating the visuals of old TVs for that vintage feel.

This file is encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption combined with Base64 encoding.
A 4-digit application PIN (which gets set during the initial onboarding when a user first instals the application) is the encryption password used to protect or encrypt the licence data.
The problem here is that an attacker who has access to the encrypted licence data (whether that be through accessing a phone backup, direct access to the device or remote compromise) could easily brute-force this 4-digit PIN by using a script that would try all 10,000 combinations…...</span>

In Kubernetes, Services are an abstract way to expose
an application running on a set of Pods. Services
can have a cluster-scoped virtual IP address (using a Service of type: ClusterIP).
Clients can connect using that virtual IP address, and Kubernetes then load-balances traffic to that
Service across the different backing Pods.
How Service ClusterIPs are allocated?
A Service ClusterIP can be assigned:
dynamically
the cluster&#x27;s control plane automatically picks a free IP address from within the configured IP range for type: ClusterIP Services.
statically
you specify an IP address of your choice, from within the configured IP range for Services.

Across your whole cluster, every Service ClusterIP must be unique.

&quot;We&#x27;re excited to bring Gloomhaven to new players around the world with Saber Interactive,&quot; Asmodee Digital CEO Pierre Ortolan confirmed to press. &quot;Partnerships like this are one of the great advantages we have available to us now as part of Embracer Group, and we look forward to tapping into even more opportunities to deliver for our fans in the future.&quot;

                              <span>A surprise ESRB listing for Square Enix&#x27;s newly announced The DioField Chronicle has revealed some additional details about the mysterious game. 

The DioField Chronicle is a new tactics game coming to PS4 and PS5 later this year, as well as PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It was announced at PlayStation State of Play back in March.

Beyond that, we haven&#x27;t really heard all that much about it, so it was a pleasant surprise to see the tactics game pop up on the ESRB website (thanks, Gematsu), not least because it included a summary of the game, as well as details as to why the board classified it as a &quot;Teen&quot; game due to its blood, &quot;mild suggestive themes&quot;, and violence. There&#x27;s also confirmation that at some point, a villain kidnaps women and &quot;forces them to work in a brothel&quot;.

Development of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl was paused back in March as the company is based in Kyiv, Ukraine&#x27;s capital, which has been repeatedly targeted during the ongoing Russian invasion. It&#x27;s since relocated to Prague whilst the war persists.

As spotted by polish site GRYonline.pl, (via VGC) however, the studio is now back at work, having confirming to fans on its Discord community that &quot;it continues&quot; development.

In an interview with NetEase Games (via Niche Gamer), Suda hinted that the team is making &quot;truly cool and all-new games&quot; that may be announced &quot;around the end of the year&quot;.

The Tokyo-based studio was bought by NetEase Games for an undisclosed fee towards the end of last year, and recently gave an interview to its new parent company. As an aging Japanese GCSE and Duolingo lessons only get me so far, thankfully the interview includes English subtitles - you can check it out below:

                              <span>Eve Anywhere is now live for Alpha players, enabling them to play Eve Online in any browser without client software.

Up until now, the feature - which lets you play the sci-fi sim on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers - was initially restricted to the premium tier Omega players only. Now, Alpha players can access it too, albeit for 30 PLEX £1.20/$1.50 per 24-hour subscription. You&#x27;ll also need a stable internet connection of at least 25mbps, too. 

&quot;Starting today Alpha pilots can now take advantage of Eve Anywhere, the revolutionary cloud-based platform that puts New Eden directly in your browser of choice!&quot; developer CCP Games explains explains (via VentureBeat).

                              <span>Players have discovered a &quot;game-breaking&quot; bug in Kirby 64.

Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards is the latest N64 game to have been released on the Nintendo Online Expansion Pass. Originally released in 2000, it&#x27;s a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer featuring Kirby&#x27;s copy abilities, which can be combined into Power Combos, and it joined the Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s library of classic games just yesterday.

However, according to Redditor Keyblademasternadroj, there&#x27;s a bug in underwater levels that &quot;causes you to enter hit stun forever&quot; that can only be rectified by quitting the game.

&quot;It&#x27;s official! 500,000 Vampires out there have stepped foot into Vardoran! Thank you all for joining us on this journey!&quot; the developer tweeted yesterday.

Although only available as an early access release for now, the newly-released open-world game has already clocked up a concurrent Steam peak of over 100,000 players - 101,036 to be precise - making it one of the most-played games on Steam right now.

                              <span>PUBG&#x27;s 17.2 update is now available on PC and mobile, bringing the 1v1 Arena to Training Mode, as well as updates to the Spotter Scope and balance changes to 5.56 Designated Marksman Rifles (DMR) and the Mortar.

&quot;The Spotter Scope and its automatic features of marking and following enemies continued to show overly strong performance, causing more stress than enjoyable experiences to our players,&quot; Krafton explains. &quot;Therefore, the enemy detection range has been reduced from 1000m to 600m and the white passive marker will not appear automatically in ADS mode.&quot;

As for the 1v1 Arena mode? That&#x27;s now available in Training Mode and welcomes &quot;all types of combat practice in a suspenseful 1v1 setting&quot;, as well as curious spectators, too.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in the mood for a spot of space domination this weekend and somehow haven&#x27;t yet given Paradox Interactive&#x27;s galactic empire builder a whirl in the six years it&#x27;s been out, now&#x27;s the perfect time to do so, given it&#x27;s free to play for the next few days.
Stellaris, a sort of space-faring amalgam of grand strategy and 4X action, burst onto the scene back in 2016 to significant acclaim. Six years on, it&#x27;s a substantially different beast, with Paradox having made some sweeping changes along the way, most notably in its radical 2.0 release.
The many faceted road to galactic supremacy it present is still a tonne of strategic fun though, even if - as is generally the way with Paradox titles - the purity of the base game has now been somewhat muddied by an increasingly unwieldy stack of post-launch DLC.

                              <span>If you were roaring at the starting line ready to race into Redout 2 later this month, you might want to cool your engines (sorry, I&#x27;ll stop this now); developer 34BigThings has announced a short delay for its stylish anti-grav racing sequel, with the game now set to release on 16th June.


Redout 2, which was originally expected to launch on 26th May, builds on the superb racing action of its 2016 predecessor with a whole new set of tracks (36 in total, plus mirror variants of each) alongside expanded customisation options - with players now able to start with one of 12 distinct chassis and strap on the likes of new rocket engines, propulsors, stabilsers, rudders, magnets, intercoolers, flaps, wings, and spoilers.


There&#x27;s also online multiplayer racing for up to 12 challengers, plus a single-player career campaign, promising &quot;hundreds&quot; of events from a variety of different modes, including Arena Races, Time Attacks, Last Man Standing, and Boss Races.

                              <span>After one hell of a long wait, the live-action Halo TV adaptation finally arrived earlier this year, and the response has been...mixed. And now Marcus Lehto, co-creator of the videogame series that started all, has shared his own thoughts on the adaptation, saying that while he doesn&#x27;t &quot;hate&quot; it, he was ultimately &quot;confused by many of the choices that were made&quot;.


Paramount+&#x27;s Halo adaptation finally launched for US audiences this March - a mere nine years after it was originally announced - and while changes were expected (fans were forewarned that the TV show takes place in the so-called Silver Timeline, separate from the core Halo canon), the end result has certainly proven divisive.


While it was Master Chief&#x27;s amusing loss of inhibitions that drew the most headlines over the series&#x27; run - just episodes after he&#x27;d stunned audiences by showing his face for the first time, he&#x27;d got his bum out, then ended the series having sex in front of his mum - there&#x27;s been plenty of criticism around the show&#x27;s writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing.

In a new interview with Leo, Reedus - the actor behind lead role, Sam Porter Bridges - discussed Death Stranding and said simply: &quot;We just started the second one.&quot;

                              <span>Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers is a brand new film out today on Disney+. For some reason, it features Ugly Sonic.


Ugly Sonic, as you&#x27;ll no doubt be aware, was the original design for Sonic in the 2020 film before fans complained. His dodgy teeth and human eyes were removed, eventually leading to a decent film and better sequel.




But now he&#x27;s back and... uglier than ever before. Honestly, it&#x27;s terrifying.

Just added for Global Accessibility Awareness Day are new badges for viewers to identify as audio or video only, so streamers can see those with a limited channel experience.


Earlier this year the platform began working with accessibility consultants to review the Creator Stream Manager dashboard on web, mobile apps, and the core UI library to improve accessibility across the board.

When this update goes live, players will be able to continue on with their adventures in The Chasm. But they will not be alone there, as they will join a new team of &quot;diverse members&quot; to &quot;discover a long-sealed history about the people, monsters and the yakshas&quot;.
In addition a to new story quest and challenges, two new playable characters will also be introduced to the game. Their names are Yelan and Kuki Shinobu and HoYoverse has assured us they will be &quot;capable allies&quot;. Yelan is described as a &quot;mysterious figure with many faces and identities&quot; and will use a bow as her weapon of choice. Meanwhile, Kuki is a &quot;surprisingly reliable and capable deputy leader of the Arataki Gang&quot; who uses a sword and can manipulate the Electro element. You can check out the new trailer for Version 2.7 below.

                              <span>We were all left to pick our jaws up from the floor when it was announced that Embracer had purchased the rights to big franchises such as Tomb Raider and Deus Ex from Square Enix earlier this month. It seemed to be the bargain of the year, if not century, for the holding company. 
Now, in its financial report, Embracer has highlighted its hopes for the future following this acquisition (including potential remakes of some classic titles) saying, &quot;after the end of the quarter, we further strengthened our development capabilities and IP-portfolio by entering into an agreement to acquire Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal, including Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and Legacy of Kain and other IPs.
&quot;We see a great potential, not only in sequels, but also in remakes, remasters, spinoffs, as well as transmedia projects across the Group.&quot;

Kubernetes v1.24 introduces alpha support for Non-Graceful Node Shutdown. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shutdown or in a non-recoverable state such as hardware failure or broken OS.
How is this different from Graceful Node Shutdown
You might have heard about the Graceful Node Shutdown capability of Kubernetes,
and are wondering how the Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature is different from that. Graceful Node Shutdown
allows Kubernetes to detect when a node is shutting down cleanly, and handles that situation appropriately.
A Node Shutdown can be &quot;graceful&quot; only if the node shutdown action can be detected by the kubelet ahead
of the actual shutdown. However, there are cases where…</span>

                              <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; sixth season of content might be well reaching its end point, but developer Rare still has a little something up is sleeve before Season 7 arrives, and it&#x27;s now inviting clue hunters to get stuck into a new &quot;multi-channel narrative experience&quot; it&#x27;s calling Mysteries.


Mysteries were originally discussed back in January, when Rare laid out its plans for Sea of Thieves in 2022. The big gambit this year, if you&#x27;re unaware, is an ongoing, season-spanning narrative that will progress across monthly in-game story episodes known as Adventures.


It&#x27;s a promising idea that so far doesn&#x27;t really seem to have found its footing, with Seas of Thieves&#x27; initial set of Adventures having felt decidedly undercooked, both in terms of their challenges and narrative presentation. But with three Adventures now under its belt, Rare is ready to launch the other major component of 2022&#x27;s ambitious narrative plans: Mysteries.

                              <span>EA has announced two new small-scale Kit expansions for The Sims 4 - one themed around evening fashion, the other around camping for kids - with both due to release on 26th May. Astute readers may note the word werewolf is yet to feature, despite previous teases from EA, but there&#x27;s still some hope it seems...


The first of EA&#x27;s newly announced expansions is the Moonlight Chic Kit, which appears to primarily focus its attention on new clothing options for your little digital pals, offering up new looks, designed by Parisian creator Paola Locatelli, said to be &quot;perfect for all the experiences a Sim will encounter during a night out on the town&quot;.


Expect &quot;slinky dresses, flowing shirts and smart jackets, all of which can be styled with sneakers for casual fun or dressed up with some silk and sparkles for a romantic date.&quot;

                              <span>Ben Brode, the charismatic former boss of Blizzard&#x27;s card battler Hearthstone, has finally revealed his new project. It&#x27;s called Marvel Snap, and is a new multiplayer collectible card game filled with comic book characters.

Brode quit Blizzard back in 2018, after more than 15 years at the company, and before its more recent troubles became public. Alongside others who had worked with him to launch Hearthstone, Brode went on to found his own studio, Second Dinner, which has been working on Marvel Snap ever since with Chinese outfit Nuverse, the gaming arm of TikTok owner Bytedance.


Snap&#x27;s focus is on short, unique matches which &quot;cut out the fluff&quot; and last around three minutes total. Player decks are smaller - 15 cards or fewer - and both players act simultaneously, rather than waiting for the other person to finish.

Metal: Hellsinger, which was revealed back in June 2020, is the work of developer The Outsiders - the studio co-founded by former Battlefield 3 lead designer and Payday 2 director David Goldfarb - and promises to developer plenty of furious gun-based demon-slaying, all synced up to a metal soundtrack.


Each of the game&#x27;s stages will feature its own track, with the player&#x27;s power increasing - alongside the complexity of the music, from atmospheric background ambience all the way up to big metal anthems - if they manage to keep their attacks timed to the beat.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - now also available in audio form! - we&#x27;re talking PlayStation Plus Premium, and our thoughts on whether it&#x27;s worth the price based on what we know so far. 

The thing is, there are still several questions about what it will provide - even now, less than a week away from its initial rollout in Asia. What is its full game list? How good will its streaming be? And how soon should we expect newer games like Ratchet &amp; Clank and Horizon Forbidden West to turn up on the service? 
The biggest difference between PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass is, of course, the lack of big new first-party games launching into Plus on day one. But, with Starfield&#x27;s delay to 2023, Microsoft might not have any on Game Pass this year either. How will Xbox counter? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer news reporters Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan.

&quot;Aspyr has gone full in to make this the best game that they can make. When we acquired Aspyr, we knew from the start that they would require our assistance [and] Saber has tremendous expertise in creating these types of products,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Ancient Egypt-set Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins looks set to receive a 60fps update for current-gen consoles in the near future. 


The update has not yet been officially announced by Ubisoft, but details of its impending arrival on PlayStation 5 were scooped up by PlayStationSize, a Twitter account which regularly crawls behind the scenes of the PlayStation Store.


Patch notes for the update include an option to enable a &quot;higher framerate&quot; on PS5, and a &quot;franchise menu&quot;. The update is expected to launch next week.

                              <span>A father is attempting to launch a class-action lawsuit against Hearthstone maker Blizzard, after his daughter secretly spent more than $300 on packs without getting all the cards they wanted.


Arizona man Nathan Harris is trying to launch the suit, which claims Hearthstone tricks players into non-refundable purchases without knowing the odds of rare cards (thanks, Polygon). 


In particular, Harris complains that his daughter - who used his credit card without asking - did not realise you could not get a refund from packs which &quot;almost never received any valuable cards&quot;. The game also lacks parental controls, Harris complained.

The announcement was made as part of the seventh anniversary celebrations for the game&#x27;s release on last-gen consoles and PC.


This is welcome news for Witcher fans, who last month got the bad news that the upgrade was delayed indefinitely after  its development was moved in-house from Saber Interactive.

&quot;As a business leader it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to navigate highly politicised issues like transgender and abortion rights. But I&#x27;m not content to sit back and say or do nothing,&quot; he tweeted, before sharing an in-depth message he had sent out to his employees.
This message reads: &quot;It is appalling that states, including the [Certain Affinity] headquarters&#x27; home state of Texas, are wading into what I consider personal health and privacy matters. Recently this encompassed gross intrusions on the rights and dignity of transgender youth, putting politics over the physical and emotional health and wellbeing of a vulnerable population, and threatening their families, friends, doctors and other supporters.

Game directors Kenji Saito and Takahisa Sugiyama were interviewed and discussed difficulties with developing a live service game.



&quot;It is our first time developing and amending content after release as part of a live service, so we need to prioritise player feedback above all else. In that sense, it really brings home the realisation that this game is very much a service as well as a standalone product,&quot; said Saito.

  Fortunately (or to the chagrin of Activision), there have since been numerous leaks revealing what&#x27;s ahead for  the first-person shooter series. 


First, there&#x27;s a brand-new game mode called DMZ, an extraction-style mode similar to Escape From Tarkov.

                              <span>Up to 100 people may lose their jobs as EA cuts customer support staff at its US office in Austin, and its European hub in Galway.


Staff affected currently support live operations on FIFA 22, Kotaku reported, among other games. 


EA has confirmed the layoffs and said the job losses would ultimately &quot;reduce complexity and increase our efficiency, flexibility and scalability&quot;.

                              <span>We may not have a release date yet, but Sony has revealed the accessibility features in its forthcoming God of War Ragnarok.


It follows on from the likes of Spider Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and The Last of Us Part Two in having an extensive suite of options.


&quot;Not only have we redesigned our UI to allow for more flexibility and readability, but we have also rebuilt controller remapping from the ground up and added more customization to our combat and interaction systems. We have retained all our accessibility features from 2018&#x27;s God of War and expanded upon them to include more than 60 ways to adjust gameplay to best suit your style and needs,&quot; reads a PlayStation Blog on the topic.

                              <span>You can now watch the first episode of the Pokémon: Hisuian Snow anime series on YouTube or through Pokémon TV.
The show&#x27;s debut episode, which is called &quot;Onto the Icy Blue&quot;, introduces us to a boy named Alec. During his youth, Alec was led to believe that Pokémon and people could not live peacefully together. This is due to the Pokémon&#x27;s powers, which the humans fear. However, when an older and wiser Alec goes to visit his father the Hisui region (of Arceus fame), he starts to look back on his childhood and recalls an encounter with a wild and (characteristically) timid Zorua. 
It is a short but adorable watch, and perfect to enjoy with a nice cup of tea. So, that&#x27;s your cue. Pop the kettle on, then come back and settle on in with the first episode, which can be watched below.

It&#x27;s planned to be about the size of the base game&#x27;s Commonwealth map, making this a hugely ambitious piece of DLC.


&quot;The mod encapsulates the gritty, adventurous nature of the Fallout games with a new world, factions, storylines, NPCs, weapons, creatures, and much more! This all comes together in a package tied with a uniquely British bow,&quot; reads the press release.

Oh, and you know The Stranger (wink wink) we all meet at the beginning of the game - well, thanks to this mod, he becomes the Hi-diddly-hoing Ned Flanders.
The mod comes from Omega Fantasy (via IGN) and uses the character models from 2003&#x27;s The Simpson&#x27;s Hit and Run. And to be honest, if all this mod did was swap out God of War&#x27;s characters for those from Hit and Run, it would have still been an incredibly amusing watch.

But now, players have also found a questionable method of farming XP - in King Kong&#x27;s private parts. 


A clip posted on the Warzone subreddit shows a player flying a helicopter toward&#x27;s King Kong&#x27;s giant testicles (which is easier said than done as Kong tends to crush anyone that heads towards him).

                              <span>Bungie has responded to the recent terrorist attack in Buffalo that resulted in the deaths of ten people and the injury of three others by announcing a new charity initiative and pledging to bolster its ongoing efforts &quot;to maintain safe and anti-racist spaces&quot; within its community.


&quot;On Saturday, 14th May, a young white man drove hours from his home to a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, and opened fire in a crowded supermarket, killing ten people and maiming three others,&quot; Bungie said in a statement. &quot;It has since been confirmed that this was an act of terror aimed at Black Americans and is being investigated as a hate crime. Our hearts go out to the victims of this tragedy, and anyone impacted by this act of violence.&quot;


The studio, in collaboration with its Black at Bungie inclusion club, has announced a number of initiatives in response to the attack. It will, for instance, donate all profits made through the sale of its Be Heard collectable pin over the next 12 months to the Southern Poverty Law Center - a charity whose work includes &quot;monitoring hate groups and other extremists throughout the United States and exposing their activities to the public, the media, and law enforcement.&quot;

The funding package will also allow for Frogwares to supply its team with specialised equipment and migrate its data infrastructure.

Released earlier this year, Horizon Forbidden West is Sony&#x27;s current premiere title for the console, though it was somewhat overshadowed by the release of Elden Ring a week later. This bundle should help to boost the game&#x27;s profile.

                              <span>EA DICE has removed the 128-player Breakthrough offering from Battlefield 2042 in its latest patch.


Update 4.1, which released today, has made substantial changes to the game&#x27;s All-Out Warfare playlists, which are available on current-gen consoles and PC. 


In a blog post, DICE explained the removal of 128-player Breakthrough lobbies was necessary to increase &quot;the value and impact of an individual player&quot;, as they currently were full of &quot;intensity and chaos&quot;.

                              <span>Twitch and Discord will be investigated by the New York attorney general, for the part they played in the racially-motivated mass shooting in Buffalo.


Attorney general Letitia James announced the investigation last night, in response to the attack which killed 10 people and wounded three more. 


The perpetrator livestreamed the attack via Twitch for two minutes before the video was removed. Before the attack took place, he had posted numerous messages discussing and promoting his plans via Discord, as well as on the notorious imageboards 4chan and 8chan. All will now be part of James&#x27; invesitigation.

                              <span>Amanita Design - the developer behind the acclaimed likes of Samorost, Machinarium, Creaks, and last year&#x27;s surreal horror Happy Games - has unveiled its latest project: &quot;hand-crafted&quot; dystopian adventure Phonopolis.
Phonopolis, which makes use of actual corrugated cardboard sets and a 12fps stop-motion animation style inspired by classic animated films, casts players as Felix, a thoughtful young man who must try and stop the titular city&#x27;s authoritarian leader from playing the Absolute tone - an occurrence that would effectively cause Felix and his fellow citizens to lose their humanity.
What follows is a story-driven puzzle adventure encompassing &quot;relatable, real-world themes&quot;, including manipulation and individualism. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll be heavy going, though; Amanita says Phonopolis will explore its subject matter in a &quot;playful and light-hearted&quot; way.

                              <span>Naughty Dog&#x27;s much-rumoured, but as yet still unannounced, The Last of Us remake for PlayStation 5 will reportedly launch before the end of this year.


Word of a PlayStation 5 remake for The Last of Us first surfaced in April 2021 when Bloomberg reported the project had initially been in the works at Sony&#x27;s San Diego-based Visual Arts Service Group before Naughty Dog was asked to take over. Further evidence of the project&#x27;s existence emerged earlier this year, when a member of Naughty Dog&#x27;s QA team listed an &quot;unannounced remake&quot; on their resumé - a reference since removed.


Yet while there&#x27;s still no official word on a Last of Us remake, rumours of the project continue to swirl, with ever-leaky GamesBeat reporter Jeff Grubb now claiming it&#x27;s set for a 2022 release.

                              <span>Thunderful Games, the studio formed after the merger of developers Zoink and Image &amp; Form, has confirmed it currently has four SteamWorld titles in the works, including the previously announced SteamWorld Headhunter.


Headhunter - a &quot;stylised and colourful, third-person co-op action adventure&quot; that was announced last November - initially looked like it would be the sixth entry in the celebrated series, following on from SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Heist, SteamWorld Dig 2, and SteamWorld Quest. That may no longer be the case, however.


According to Thunderful&#x27;s latest earnings report (thanks IGN), Headhunter, which is now scheduled for a 2023 release, won&#x27;t be the only SteamWorld title coming that year. An accompany release schedule reveals that Thunderful has three additional, currently unannounced SteamWorld games in development, with two of those also due in 2023.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play team-based sports game Roller Champions finally has a release date and will, after a bit of a delay earlier this year, be launching next Wednesday, 25th May on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


Roller Champions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is Ubisoft&#x27;s stab at creating the kind of knockabout sports mash-up that&#x27;s made Rocket League such a perennial favourite, playing out like a fast-paced hybrid of competitive roller-skating, hockey, and football - wherein two teams of three hurtle around a track in an attempt to wrestle the ball from one another and score a goal.


Is it any good? Time will tell, but Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell was pretty impressed when he played an early version shortly after its E3 2019 unveiling, calling it &quot;honestly one of the demos I found hardest to tear myself away from.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Spiders&#x27; scrappy but enjoyable RPG GreedFall is getting a sequel, and it&#x27;ll be launching for PC and unspecified consoles in 2024. Or next year - publisher Nacon&#x27;s press release and YouTube description currently disagree, which I&#x27;m trying to get to the bottom of.


When the original GreedFall launched in 2019, its combination of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice struck a bit of a chord despite its unavoidable rough edges, quickly raising its profile through plenty of positive word of mouth - ultimately, to the tune of over 2m sales - as players got stuck into its ambitious historical fantasy yarn.


&quot;GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults,&quot; said Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield in her review at the time, &quot;and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings.&quot;

                              <span>Sony has announced plans to accelerate the company&#x27;s Road to Zero initiative, its plan to achieve carbon neutrality throughout its entire &quot;value chain&quot;, by 10 years.
The Road to Zero plan was first concieved in 2010, when Sony announced it as a &quot;a long-term global environmental plan... to realise a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of Sony&#x27;s products and business activities&quot;. Originally, this target of carbon neutrality was set for 2050. However, today the company released a statement revealing a new target year of 2040.
&quot;Sony will accelerate its target year for carbon neutrality, that is, greenhouse gas emissions of virtually zero, from 2050 to 2040. Specifically, Sony intends to make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations carbon neutral by 2030, and by 2040, in addition to scopes 1 and 2, Sony will also target other emissions originating from stages such as products, supply chains, and logistics (scope 3), aiming for net zero emissions achieved in all scopes.&quot;

                              <span>Last week, I got to have a closer look at the Saints Row reboot from Volition. As you would expect, it looked bombastic and eclectic, with a myriad of unusual ideas that can only really be married together in a Saints Row game.
However, at this point, it also felt like Volition has focused a bit too much on adding in all this &quot;stuff&quot; to the game, and seemingly at the cost of some polish and finesse. Saints Row was confirmed to be a cross-gen release on its initial announcement last year, and that seems to be a fair market for it. Right now, it just looks and feels like more of a last-gen game than a current one.
Throughout the showcase, Saints Row&#x27;s fighting appeared to be a touch clunky, while its cutscenes and dialogue felt more forced than we may expect from a game today. Meanwhile, during a close up of the Boss&#x27; face, you could clearly see that the character&#x27;s eyelashes and eyelids did not match up in the way you would expect them to. This could be a bug that will be fixed by launch, but it was nonetheless jarring on the eye (mine, not the Boss&#x27;, although their eye did look jarred as well).

                              <span>Following my hands off preview of the Saints Row reboot, I sat down and chatted more with Volition developers Kenzie Lindgren (associate UX designer) and Damien Allen (principal designer). We covered a broad range of topics, including plenty on what&#x27;s new for this entry, but we started by discussing why Saints Row aficionados should come back to the series, despite its brand-new cast and setting. 


&quot;It definitely still feels like Saints Row - even if it&#x27;s not the same characters, even if it&#x27;s not the same setting, even if it&#x27;s not exactly the same as before - it feels like Saints Row,&quot; Lindgren said.


&quot;I feel that every single time I go into the game, whether that&#x27;s just customisation (because customisation is a huge part of it), whether that&#x27;s travelling around the city, whether that&#x27;s wing suiting and doing the missions, it feels like Saints Row. And I think that&#x27;s at least worth checking out if you&#x27;re an older player, but also for a newer player to discover that feeling for the first time.&quot;

Presumably this could be news on part two of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, as well as other projects in the works.

This paid-for add-on lets you fling birds at pigs, as is tradition, now in blocky 3D.  There&#x27;s a story mode, which plays like a classic Minecraft map, or a full-on version of the classic Angry Birds gameplay, converted into Minecraft.

The expansion is the work of Oreville Studios, a developer dedicated to building content on the Minecraft Marketplace platform, and looks... decent? Here&#x27;s a trailer showing gameplay:

                              <span>For those who had a PlayStation 3 in 2009, Shatter was a must play. Its block-busting gameplay was married with a slamming soundtrack that made it an ideal way to pass some time while waiting for the release of Fast and Furious and other classics of that year. However, if you didn&#x27;t have the chance to bop along with this sci-fi puzzler then, now is your chance. 
Yes, that&#x27;s right, the game is getting remastered. And, not only that, it is also coming to even more consoles than before. In &quot;late 2022&quot;, you will be able to play Shatter Remastered Deluxe on Windows and Mac for PC (via Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. You are, quite simply, spoiled for choice. 
You can check out the announcement trailer for Shatter Remastered Deluxe below.

                              <span>The Chant, a horror adventure set on a spooky spiritual retreat, has announced an October release window for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S - but the game&#x27;s previously-announced PS4 and Xbox One versions won&#x27;t be joining them.


The Chant is the second game in as many weeks to prioritise its current-gen console launches, following the recent cancellation of Gotham Knights for PS4 and Xbox One. 

A fresh trailer has shown off the game&#x27;s story, and confirmed its lack of current-gen consoles:

Chatting in this week&#x27;s Famitsu, Yoji Fujito revealed the game will not be shut down &quot;anytime soon&quot;.
&quot;Due to past comments, there may be some people who are worried that the game will be shutting down in 2022,&quot; Fujito stated (translated by siliconera). &quot;But I don&#x27;t think you will have to be concerned about that happening anytime soon.&quot;

                              <span>Square Enix has finally fixed a performance issue with Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, two months after its release.


As reported back in March, hair and fur textures were tanking the frame rate when played on PC - sometimes as low as 8FPS. Modders have released fixes which make all characters bald in a bid to alleviate the issue.



Now an update has been released for the game, in which &quot;models for hair and fur associated with important characters have been revised to improve performance.&quot;

                              <span>Solo developer Stephen Ddungu believes Disney and Marvel likely copied his indie game for an eye-catching fight sequence in the recent Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.


Ddungu has been chronicling his work on music-based JRPG Sword of Symphony via Tiktok, where footage of the game&#x27;s combat system has notched up millions of views (thanks, Kotaku). 


His game allows you to conjur glowing musical notes in mid-air and send them flinging towards an enemy. If you&#x27;ve seen the new Doctor Strange, you&#x27;ll likely recognise that description - since a short sequence in the film sees Benedict Cumberbatch doing just that.

In the video, presenters of the tool embarrassingly apply their findings to Nintendo&#x27;s series.


Apparently the game lacks diversity in ability and sexual orientation, as the characters aren&#x27;t disabled and are all presumed straight. How you can tell someone&#x27;s sexual orientation just by looking at them is beyond me.

The investment means the PIF is now Nintendo&#x27;s fifth-largest shareholder, Bloomberg reported this morning. 


In response, Nintendo said it learned of the stake from news reports and declined to comment further.

However, speaking to IGN at Polish games conference Digital Dragons, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno said he cannot comment, but the studio hopes to make an announcement on future projects &quot;as soon as we can&quot;.

                              <span>Researchers have demonstrated iPhone malware that works even when the phone is fully shut down.
t turns out that the iPhone’s Bluetooth chip­ — which is key to making features like Find My work­ — has no mechanism for digitally signing or even encrypting the firmware it runs. Academics at Germany’s Technical University of Darmstadt figured out how to exploit this lack of hardening to run malicious firmware that allows the attacker to track the phone’s location or run new features when the device is turned off.
[…]
The research is the first — or at least among the first — to study the risk posed by chips running in low-power mode. Not to be confused with iOS’s low-power mode for conserving battery life, the low-power mode (LPM) in this research allows chips responsible for near-field communication, ultra wideband, and Bluetooth to run in a special mode that can remain on for 24 hours after a device is turned off...</span>

Kubernetes v1.24 introduces a new alpha-level feature that prevents unauthorised users
from modifying the volume mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim created from an
existing VolumeSnapshot in the Kubernetes cluster.
The problem
The Volume Mode determines whether a volume
is formatted into a filesystem or presented as a raw block device.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

When leveraging the above capability, there is…</span>

                              <span>From Elden Ring on Game Boy to that Advance Wars/Mass Effect mash-up, demakes are all the rage these days - and now it&#x27;s classic first-person puzzler Portal&#x27;s turn to get the retro port treatment, courtesy of a new fan project to rebuild it for N64.


Portal, of course, released back in 2007 as part of Valve&#x27;s legendary Orange Box collection, where it immediately wrought cake memes, Companion Cubes and iconic antagonist GLaDOS upon an unsuspecting world. It also proved to be an ingenious puzzler beneath all that - tasking players with manipulating portals to navigate increasingly devious challenges - and one that still holds up wonderfully today.


The currently in-development Portal demake, officially known as Portal 64, is the work of developer James Lambert, and is ambitiously attempting to pack the entire experience of Valve&#x27;s classic - memes, portals, puzzles, and all - down onto Nintendo hardware that preceded its release by over a decade.

                              <span>Following recent reports that Sony is refusing to approve any statements from PlayStation studios relating to reproductive rights, Bungie - whose acquisition by Sony was announced in February - has said &quot;there will never be a &#x27;muzzle&#x27; big enough to stop us from standing up for what&#x27;s right&quot;.
Bungie was one of the first studios to speak out in support of Roe v Wade, a key judgement which legalised abortion across the US, following recent reports the US Supreme Court was trying to overturn the ruling. At the time, the developer called the move a &quot;direct attack on human rights&quot;, adding that &quot;standing up for reproductive choice and liberty is not a difficult decision to make, and Bungie remains dedicated to upholding these values&quot;.
However, in light of reports that Sony is refusing to authorise any public statements its PlayStation studios might want to make around the issue of reproductive rights, some Bungie fans have questioned whether the developer will still be able to express its opinion so freely once its acquisition by Sony is complete.

                              <span>Developer The Bearded Ladies, the studio behind 2018&#x27;s acclaimed turn-based strategy adventure Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, has unveiled Miasma Chronicles - a new tactical RPG that&#x27;s heading to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 some time next year.


Miasma Chronicles unfolds in a United States torn apart by a force known only as the Miasma, some time in the &quot;not-too-distant future&quot;. Here, in the mining town of Sedentary, we meet our protagonist Elvis, a young man raised by a robotic older &quot;brother&quot; after being left by his mother. 


Elvis, for reasons both unknown and extremely convenient as far as gameplay goes, has access to a mysterious glove that enables him to control Miasma - a device that&#x27;ll almost certainly prove useful as the brothers set out across the post-apocalyptic wasteland in search of answers that might &quot;change the course of human history forever.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Bohemia Interactive has, following an extensive leak over the weekend, officially unveiled Arma Reforger, the next step in its long-running first-person military shooter series. Described as the &quot;first milestone on the long road to Arma 4&quot;, Reforger launches into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access today.


Bohemia opened a lengthy livestream earlier today with confirmation that the long-awaited Arma 4 is in development (its predecessor, Arma 3, celebrates its 10th birthday next year), but the remainder of the stream&#x27;s focus was very much on Reforger. It&#x27;s being called a new standalone &quot;platform&quot; for the series, consisting of several key parts; there&#x27;s a new engine, a new open-world sandbox, three gameplay modes, and integrated modding tools, enabling user to create and download mods directly in-game.


Reforger&#x27;s sandbox should be immediately familiar to fans of Bohemia&#x27;s previous titles, taking the form of the Everon map seen in 2001&#x27;s Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, albeit thoroughly reworked and reimagined using the developer&#x27;s latest tech. As that might suggest, it marks a return to the Cold War era for the series, circa 1989, with Bohemia saying its keen to capture the atmosphere of the 80s across its 51 sq km map.

                              <span>Fortnite has teased the return of an enormous icon from its original Island, as the clock counts down to the game&#x27;s latest big season finale.


While not yet confirmed by developer Epic Games, eagle-eyed Fortnite leakers are confident this season will end in another of the game&#x27;s eye-catching live events - the first of 2022 - likely on Saturday, 4th June.


This afternoon, Epic itself issued a typically cryptic teaser with snippets of audio and an unmistakable logo at the end: the fan-favourite Mech (or Mecha Team Leader, to give its full name) which duelled and ultimately beat Fortnite&#x27;s Devourer monster in one of the game&#x27;s most memorable moments back in 2019.

Jurassic World Evolution 2 is the dinosaur management sim sequel which adds in plenty of new features and creatures, including flying and airborne reptiles. 


Developer Frontier last year admitted the game had under-performed, something it blamed on the delay of the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion movie, now due in June. Here&#x27;s hoping Xbox Game Pass gives it fresh legs.

                              <span>Lost Ark still has a bot problem, publisher Amazon Games has admitted. 


In a blog post acknowledging the continued issue and the ongoing &quot;frustration within the community&quot; it said it had felt too, Amazon announced it had permanently banned &quot;several million accounts that participated in botting, hacking or gold-selling&quot;.


&quot;Since Lost Ark launched, we&#x27;ve been fighting a war against the bots infiltrating Arkesia,&quot; Amazon dramatically wrote. &quot;Addressing bots can be especially challenging in free-to-play games because it&#x27;s so easy to create an account and enter the game, but we&#x27;re working on multiple fronts to fight them.&quot;
