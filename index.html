                              <span>Halo Infinite developer, 343 Industries, is looking for a new multiplayer playlist designer with an emphasis on Forge content.

The recruitment advertisement, which went live earlier this week, makes a clear connection between the success of the sci-fi shooter&#x27;s multiplayer game and the ability to &quot;work directly&quot; with the Halo community and players who make their own maps and assets in its map-making mode, Forge.

&quot;In this role you&#x27;ll design, implement, and manage playlists that align with the needs of Halo Infinite. You&#x27;ll work with partner teams to ensure content (maps and modes) is properly represented in our playlists and aligns with scheduled game events,&quot; the ad explains.

The companies say that &quot;at the heart of Empower Up&quot; is a practical Health Check tool that companies can use to benchmark where they are &quot;on their EDI journey&quot;, as well as provide further advice and guidance on how to move forward. 

&quot;Empower Up is suitable for all games companies, wherever they are on their EDI journey,&quot; Ukie says. &quot;For those looking to gain more understanding about what EDI is and why it’s important, the Intro To EDI section provides an overview. It also provides a summary of different Diversity Characteristics and Under-Represented Groups, along with some specific advice and guidance on each.

                              <span>Nier series producer Yosuke Saito has confirmed that while &quot;[director] Yoko Taro is alive&quot;, new Nier games will be released.

In an interview with 4Gamer.net (日本語) and shared by Genki, Saito said that while another Nier game would be coming, the duo was currently working on a &quot;separate&quot; project, and teased that we can expect to hear more about that unannounced game next year.

The news came via &quot;a meeting to talk incessantly about the production of Nier Automata&quot; presentation at the Korean video game show G-STAR 2023 – yes, I love the title, too – in which Saito talked about the development of the original game and hinted at what lay ahead for the fan-favourite series.

                              <span>The Division: Heartland has been rated in Taiwan.

The free-to-play third-person action-shooter spin-off was announced in May 2021 and was initially set to release in 2021-22. Ubisoft has since been taciturn about the game&#x27;s release window, but the rating – which was published earlier this month – intimates that we could be getting a firm release date soon.

Because of &quot;violence, inappropriate language&quot;, and &quot;anti-society&quot; leanings – make of that what you will – the shooter has been awarded a PG-15 rating on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.

                              <span>Valve boss Gabe Newell has been ordered to appear in court as part of an antitrust lawsuit filed by Wolfire Games.

As first reported by our friends at GamesIndustry.biz, Wolfire Games – which filed the order earlier this month – brought an antitrust lawsuit against the megacorp back in 2021. Whilst Newell requested a remote deposition due to health concerns, admitting he has &quot;structured his life to minimise exposure to possible COVID-19 transmission&quot;, Wolfire insists that there is &quot;insubstantial evidence to suggest that he is at particularised risk of serious illness&quot; and wants him there in person. 

Wolfire further asserts that Newell needs to attend in person because it believes he is &quot;uniquely positioned to testify on all aspects of [Valve&#x27;s] business strategy&quot;, and the company wants to &quot;adequately assess Newell&#x27;s credibility&quot;.

                              <span>An &quot;extremely early&quot; Left 4 Dead prototype is now available to play thanks to Counter-Strike&#x27;s 1.6 update.

According to content creator Gabe Follower, the prototype – called Terror Strike – was &quot;accidentally compiled&quot; and added to the Counter-Strike update, showing how the zombie game&#x27;s DNA lies firmly in the mod for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and was developed using CS assets, including Counter-Strike weapons.

The files were quickly pulled from the 22nd November update, but not quickly enough to stop them being yoinked and then distributed publicly.

                              <span>A rating for Prison Architect 2 has popped up in Korea.

At the time of writing, a sequel to Introversion Software&#x27;s wildly popular management sim has not been formally announced, yet Prison Architect 2 has been rated as suitable for &quot;juvelines&quot; by Korea&#x27;s Game Rating and Administration Committee. 

Interestingly, the link that once led to the rating is now dead, and the game doesn&#x27;t turn up if you search for it, either in English or Korean. So make of that what you will.

                              <span>A Switch rating for Borderlands Collection: Pandora&#x27;s Box has popped up in Germany.

Right now, the collection is only available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and has not yet been confirmed for Switch, which only received a Borderlands 3 port back in October, four years after the threequel was released on other platforms.

Interestingly, it was submitted for classification quite some time ago – the website says Pandora&#x27;s Box was given its 14+ rating back in August – but it&#x27;s only now come to the attention of the eagle-eyed folks on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit and has yet to be added to the Nintendo eShop.

                              <span>Activision wants to recommend games to you based on the livestreams you watch.

According to a patent filed in July and published publicly just last week – snappily entitled &quot;systems and methods of dynamically modifying video game content based on non-video game content being concurrently experienced by a user&quot; – Activision wants to keep track of what you watch and use that data to make personalised recommendations to you.

As spotted by Exputer, this would make a typically passive viewing experience more interactive, and could even mean &quot;generating&quot; a game just for you or modifying an existing game&#x27;s content to better suit the kinds of things you like to watch in livestreams.

                              <span>Back in August, as part of this year&#x27;s TennoCon celebrations, Warframe developer Digital Extremes unveiled Whispers in the Walls, the next (and extremely weird) chapter in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter&#x27;s ongoing saga. And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion&#x27;s release, including confirmation it&#x27;ll arrive alongside cross-save support.


Whispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It&#x27;s an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos, and one that&#x27;ll reveal the &quot;proverbial big bang&quot; that kicked off every event in Warframe.


In terms of enemies, the labyrinthine laboratory plays host to a much-expanded Necramech faction, including new Necrodogs, that players can battle using Whispers in the Walls&#x27; new Grimoire, a secondary weapon capable of flinging pages of devastating Void. But that&#x27;s not the expansion&#x27;s only new threat; at certain points, players will find themselves whisked away from the gothic gloom of Albrecht&#x27;s lab to a vast Eldritch desert that serves as the home of the mysterious Man in the Wall. Here, they&#x27;ll encounter a second new faction, the Murmur, nightmarish multi-limbed creatures resembling tech-infused biblical angels.

                              <span>Super Mario RPG&#x27;s recently released Switch remake is a lovely thing, freshening up a much-loved classic for a new generation, while ensuring its core remains faithful enough that it can deliver a wonderful blast of nostalgia for long-time fans. And it turns out that faithfulness runs deep, with players having discovered it restores a fun little easter egg that was cut from the original version during the localisation process for release outside of Japan.


More specifically, the 1996 Japanese version of Super Mario RPG contained a cute - if ultimately fairly pointless - sequence that would trigger if players entered the cheat code &#x27;Down, Up, Right, Left, L, R, L, R, B&#x27; on the pause screen.


Rather than showering players with treats to make the experience a little easier or give everyone a massive head, as cheat codes tended to do at the time, entering Super Mario RPG&#x27;s sequence of button presses would instead cause Toad to materialise and ponder what the secret code you just entered could possibly have done.

The Squid Nebula is shown in blue, indicating doubly ionized oxygen—­which is when you ionize your oxygen once and then ionize it again just to make sure. (In all seriousness, it likely indicates a low-mass star nearing the end of its life).

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                              <span>Ubisoft has said that pop-up adverts seen last night within Assassin&#x27;s Creed games have now been disabled, and were the result of a technical error. 


The adverts, which promoted other games in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series that are currently on sale for Black Friday, were spotted by some players yesterday evening, prompting complaints online.


Players reported seeing the adverts pop-up when they paused the action to load the in-game map. One example shared on X, formerly Twitter, shows an advert for 20 percent off Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage fill the screen when a player accesses the map within Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.

The developer shared this milestone as part of a Thanksgiving post, stating it was grateful to everyone who had visited Arcadia Bay with Max and Chloe and experienced Life is Strange&#x27;s time maniplating and emotionally charged story.


&quot;We want to thank each and every one of you for playing,&quot; the account wrote, with an accompanying reel showing moments from the game (which made me get a little choked up, I won&#x27;t lie).

Luke&#x27;s stream ended abruptly last night as sirens were heard in the background, and as he received a call warning him that police were outside. 


&quot;Oh nice,&quot; he said. &quot;Alright I&#x27;ve gotta go, now these assholes have swatted my house.&quot;

                              <span>Original Bayonetta director Hideki Kamiya suspects many of his ideas for the series will be going to the grave with him. 


Kamiya&#x27;s comments come as part of his most recent YouTube video, where the PlatinumGames co-founder said he fully expects the Bayonetta franchise to continue without him. 


&quot;I worked on Bayonetta 1, 2, 3 and Origins,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ve talked about this in various interviews, that the Bayonetta series would consist of a total of nine episodes, and that I wanted to grow the franchise as the Bayonetta &#x27;Saga&#x27;, but it seems like I may have to take the full saga to the grave with me.&quot;

                              <span>American Truck Simulator rumbles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has announced it&#x27;ll be making its next stop, this time in the state of Kansas - the destination of its newest paid expansion - next Thursday, 30th November. Plus, its substantial 1.49 update - which adds a dynamic night sky, the moon, HDR skyboxes, and more - is out now.


Kansas was confirmed to be the focus of American Truck Simulator &#x27;s next, post-Oklahoma expansion back in February, bringing the tally of explorable states in the game up to 14, joining the previously released California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma.


American Truck Simulator&#x27;s rendition of Kansas - or the Sunflower State, if you will - promises to give potential visitors and their hefty transportation a tour of the area&#x27;s &quot;native grasslands, streams, abundant blue skies, and green grassland vistas&quot;. You can see some of that across copious screenshots in SCS&#x27; launch date announcement post.

                              <span>As families come together to gorge on turkey/give thanks for Doctor Who being 60, what better way to mark the occasion than with a bit of a (spacey) freebie from the Epic Games Store, specifically in the form of Deliver Us Mars?


Deliver Us Mars, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is this year&#x27;s sequel to developer KeokeN Interactive&#x27;s 2018 sci-fi puzzle-adventure Deliver Us the Moon. For this secound outing, players step into the massive space clogs of an astronaut, Kathy, as she travels to the red planet in search of her missing father and technology that might just help save Earth from ecological disaster. 


What follows is a mix of first-person platforming and puzzle solving reminiscent of its predecessor, although it doesn&#x27;t appear Deliver Us Mars enjoyed quite as positive a critical reception as the fist game. Still, free is free, so if some cerebral spacey excitement appeals, you&#x27;ll want to be pointing yourself toward the Epic Games Store over the next seven days.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss this year&#x27;s various video game remakes and remasters, including the recently-announced The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which is headed to PlayStation 5 in January.
While TLOU2 was launched on PS4, it&#x27;s still just three years on from that game&#x27;s arrival. How do we feel about there already being a &quot;Remaster&quot;, and are its DVD extra-style additions worth a £10 upgrade? 
We also discuss some of the other remakes to arrive (again) this year, including the excellent new versions of Dead Space and Resident Evil 4. It&#x27;s good these games are finding new audiences, but are we in danger of focusing too much on the past, and on safe, known franchises? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer&#x27;s Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The group­—known by many names, including Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM, Armageddon, and Shuckworm—has been active since at least 2014 and has been attributed to Russia’s Federal Security Service by the Security Service of Ukraine. Most Kremlin-backed groups take pains to fly under the radar; Gamaredon doesn’t care to. Its espionage-motivated campaigns targeting large numbers of Ukrainian organizations are easy to detect and tie back to the Russian government.

Welcome to another edition of the SIG spotlight blog series, where we
highlight the incredible work being done by various Special Interest
Groups (SIGs) within the Kubernetes project. In this edition, we turn
our attention to SIG Testing,
a group interested in effective testing of Kubernetes and automating
away project toil. SIG Testing focus on creating and running tools and
infrastructure that make it easier for the community to write and run
tests, and to contribute, analyze and act upon test results.
To gain some insights into SIG Testing, Sandipan
Panda spoke with Michelle Shepardson,
a senior software engineer at Google and a chair of SIG Testing, and
Patrick Ohly, a software engineer and architect at
Intel and a SIG Testing Tech Lead.

Tekken 8 developer Bandai Namco has also listed 16 GB RAM as its recommended memory requirement. While this does seem to be along the standard line for PC games today, it is still twice that of Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s memory recommendations.

But you&#x27;ll actually need two phones to play it - one to act as a controller, while a separate mobile device needs to have the Amico Controller app installed and be connected to the same wireless network.
Alternatively, Intellivision states the official Amico hardware controllers are compatible with the app via Bluetooth, except they haven&#x27;t been released yet and the company didn&#x27;t specify when customers can expect them.

The report, conducted by Atomik Research for SuperScale&#x27;s Good Games Don&#x27;t Die and shared by Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz, was based on interviews with 500 game developers, from both here in the UK and across the pond in the US. 


The report stated the majority of mobile games reached peak revenue within the first 12 months of their release. While 76 percent reach their peak revenue in the first year, only four percent peak in the second year of release.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 developer Sledgehammer Games has said it is &quot;investigating&quot; an exploit that allows players to wriggle around on the floor while prone at fast speeds.


It leaves you looking like some kind of human Call of Duty snake, but it also leaves you able to zoom around while lying prone - a very handy tactic for winning gunfights.


Now, Sledgehammer has taken notice and dubbed Call of Duty snaking as a PC exploit to be looked at further. &quot;We&#x27;re investigating an exploit that allows players to sprint while appearing in the prone animation,&quot; the developer wrote on the official CODUPdates account on X, formerly Twitter.

                              <span>Andrzej Sapkowski may have penned The Witcher novels, which in turn inspired both CD Projekt Red&#x27;s video game series and Netflix&#x27;s TV adaptation, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the streaming service ever listened to his feedback.


While attending Vienna Comic Con, Sapkowski was asked about the various adaptations that have stemmed from his original works. Speaking with Cerealkillers, the author said that every visual adaptation of his The Witcher series was &quot;strange&quot; for him to see, because as a writer he only uses his words.


&quot;My raw material when I work, it&#x27;s only letters. I do not describe pictures. I don&#x27;t see any pictures. I use the letters only because I know that my reader will see in the book the letters only, not the pictures. So I have to do with my letters to make the reader imagine the picture, not the other way around... so every [visual] adaptation, it&#x27;s simply strange for me,&quot; he explained.

                              <span>The world has been given a tiny glimpse into the uber-secretive world of Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar North thanks to a fascinating new blog from former technical director Obbe Vermeij, who, in just a few short weeks, has shed light on the studio&#x27;s cancelled spy game Agent, discussed a zombie game abandoned by the company after it was deemed to be too &quot;depressing&quot;, and more.


Vermeij served as technical director at Rockstar North from 1995 (when the studio was still known as DMA Design) to 2009, meaning his time at the company spanned the creation of Grand Theft Auto as a series right through to Grand Theft Auto 4 and its DLC.


Since launching his blog earlier this month, Vermeij has been sharing anecdotes covering a number of Rockstar games, touching on everything from the company&#x27;s streaming tech for Grand Theft Auto 3 - which struggled enough that the art team was forced to shove a building in the middle of a long stretch of Portland road to ensure players wouldn&#x27;t run out of city while loading continued - to early efforts at implementing multiplayer in GTA 3.

                              <span>Following some initial rumblings earlier this year, a new report has lend further credence to suggestions 2024&#x27;s Call of Duty game will be another entry in the Black Ops series, this one now said to be taking place in the Gulf War.


Word that Call of Duty 2024 would be a new Black Ops game first surfaced back in February, when it was claimed next year&#x27;s series entry was being developed by Treyarch under the codename Cerberus. Furher evidence backing this up arrived in July, when actor and singer Luke Charles Stafford shared a Facebook post referencing Black Ops and claiming his likeness would be used for next year&#x27;s main character, &quot;Ratcliff&quot;.


And that brings us to a new report from Windows Central which, citing &quot;multiple sources familiar with Activision&#x27;s plans&quot;, says next year&#x27;s Call of Duty &quot;is indeed Black Ops&quot;. The publication also claims the game will attempt to &quot;explore a nuanced narrative of the Gulf War, with a critical focus on different participants within the conflict.&quot;

                              <span>With winter looming, THQ Nordic has seized this most seasonally appropriate opportunity to showcase more of its upcoming South Park: Snow Day, with its latest trailer revealing a smattering of new gameplay for the co-op adventure.


South Park: Snow Day was initially teased back in August last year, making a sneaky post-credits appearance at the very end of THQ Nordic&#x27;s 2022 showcase. One year on, it made a second showcase appearance, this time to confirm its title, unveil its decidedly un-TV-show like 3D visual style, and reveal a handful of other details.


We know, for instance, that South Park: Snow Day (which is being developed by The Blackout Club studio Question) is a co-op adventure in which up to four players - along with familiar faces including Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny - enjoy their day away from school by battling through the snow-blanketed South Park streets on a quest to save the world.

                              <span>There&#x27;s some bad news if you were hoping to get your Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 fix anytime soon; publisher Focus Entertainment has announced a substantial delay for the third-person sci-fi shooter, which is now expected to arrive in the second half of next year.


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - which follows the continuing adventures of original series protagonist Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus (once again voiced by Mark Strong) - was originally due to launch in &quot;winter&quot; this year, but Focus has now announced a delay as part of an &quot;update on execution of the line-up and partnerships&quot;.


As per Focus&#x27; revised release schedule, Space Marine 2 - which is being developed by Saber Interactive - will now launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC in the &quot;second half of 2024&quot;, with Focus saying the delay will &quot;provide the time needed to properly polish the game and to ensure the best possible experience&quot;.

                              <span>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, one fan has released an animated short of Castle Town reimagined as a setting in a Studio Ghibli film.
YouTuber RwanLink said the environment and characters took four months to make in Unreal Engine 5, and totals to over 600 hours of work whilst also in a full-time job.
The short video follows Link as he leaves Kokiri Forest for Hyrule Castle, and we bump into some familiar faces such as Malon, the Happy Mask Shop Owner, and even Skyward Sword&#x27;s Fi skating around the Master Sword.

                              <span>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has claimed Google offered him what &quot;seemed like a crooked arrangement&quot; in order to persuade the company to release Fortnite in the Google Play Store rather than through its own website.
Sweeney made the statement when he took to the witness stand yesterday in the ongoing trial between Epic and Google.
As reported by AP, Sweeney described a meeting between himself and Google at the latter&#x27;s headquarters to discuss an agreement which would see Epic release Fortnite on the Play Store. &quot;It seemed like a crooked arrangement,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;Google was proposing a series of side deals which seemed designed to convince Epic not to compete against them,&quot; he continued.

                              <span>Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew developer Mimimi Games has announced it&#x27;ll release two DLC expansions for the supernatural stealth tactics game on 6th December.
The DLCs will mark the final release from Mimimi before it closes as it announced back in August. At the time, studio co-founders  Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth revealed it was working on a &quot;big content drop&quot; for Shadow Gambit, which we know now is in the form of two expansion.
Each expansion will include a new playable character with unique abilities, a new island to explore, and a story campaign told across six new missions. The new characters can be used in most of the main game&#x27;s missions and aren&#x27;t limited to the DLC missions, Mimimi stated.

                              <span>Ubisoft has given a brief update on its missing in action Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has had a troubled development and still lacks a formal release date. 


Originally announced back in 2020 for release the following year, work on the game was rebooted when development dragged on and the project was then moved from Ubisoft Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.


Updates from the project have since been scarce, though Ubisoft broke cover last night to state that the game was still very much in development and had recently &quot;passed an important internal milestone&quot;.

                              <span>Activision has said its new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has broken multiple player engagement records, without providing any specific player numbers. 


&quot;Just two weeks in, Modern Warfare 3 has already set records with the highest engagement in the new Modern Warfare trilogy,&quot; states a post by the Call of Duty account on X, formerly Twitter.


These records include the fact Modern Warfare 3 owners are playing &quot;more hours per player overall&quot; and &quot;campaign players [are] putting in more time per player&quot; than in the modern Modern Warfare 1 and 2.

                              <span>GameMaker, a series of cross-platform engines for game developers, has ditched its subscription model for non-commercial purposes, hobbyists and indie developers.
GameMaker will now be free for anyone using its software non-commercially on all non-console platforms. Creator and indie subscriptions have been replaced with a one-time fee of $100, meanwhile, which grants a commercial license and enables exports to desktop and mobile platforms.
The change appears to have been prompted by the recent and controversial changes Unity announced for its pricing model, which would introduce a fee for developers per game install. The plan was met with anger from indie developers, causing Unity to walk back significantly on its proposed changes.

This sci-fi third-person shooter was developed during the N64 heyday of British studio Rare, and launched during the four-year period the company also released classics such as GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64 and Perfect Dark. 


It may not have the brand power of some of those, but it&#x27;s still a solid arcade-inspired adventurey shooter with a lengthy single-player and a deathmatch-style multiplayer.

                              <span>Conveniently timed to coincide with the launch of this year&#x27;s Steam autumn sale, Blizzard has announced a free trial week for Diablo 4 - plus discounts across all versions of the game - starting today and running until 28th November.


Diablo 4&#x27;s free trial lets players dip their toes into the world of Sanctuary, and includes full access to co-op and crossplay, but there&#x27;s one major limitation: progression is capped at level 20. Exactly how much playtime that equates to is a little unclear, especially given Diablo 4&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Blessing event is also now live, boosting XP and Gold by 35% until 27th November.


Regardless, Blizzard says all trial progress can be carried over to the full game should your time with Diablo 4 convince you to make a purchase. And there&#x27;s additional incentive to do so, considering all versions of the game are currently discounted by 40% as part of the Steam  sale.

Official word that a new Subnautica game was on the way first surfaced in April last year, when developer Unknown Worlds - the studio behind the series&#x27; original 2018 entry and its 2021 follow-up Subnautica: Below Zero - announced it was seeking a senior narrative designer to &quot;help shape the next game in the Subnautica universe&quot;.


And now, a little over 18 months later, the new Subnautica has made an appearance in publisher Krafton&#x27;s slate of upcoming releases, as shared via the deeply unsexy means of financial report PowerPoint slide presentation (thanks Rock Paper Shotgun). It&#x27;s set to launch in &quot;1H25&quot; - the first half of 2025 - but, beyond that, details are limited.

                              <span>Back in September, Dave the Diver studio Mintrocket unveiled Nakwon: Last Paradise, a 16-player stealth-survival extraction game set on the streets of Seoul amid an undead apocalypse, and now - with a public pre-alpha playtest looming - it&#x27;s shared 22 minutes of gameplay.


Nakwon is a game of two parts; the primary focus is Scouting, requiring players (either solo or in a team of two) to leave the titular safe zone in order to scavenge for resources out in the city. Being a PvPvE experience, the threats outside are twofold: there&#x27;re the zombies - which can&#x27;t be killed, meaning stealth is key to survival - alongside other human scavengers, who&#x27;ll either need to be avoided or set upon with makeshift weaponry (firearms are a scare commodity).


Players can come and go as they like, meaning once they&#x27;re satisfied with their haul, they can return to the safe zone, where Nakwon&#x27;s more simulation-focused activities occur. Here, hard-gained resources can be sold for money, which is used to increase Citizen Grades and secure better priveliges and benefits. &quot;Every day, you must decide whether to go out for Scouting or staying inside,&quot; Mintrocket explained previously. &quot;But, you must consistently secure more food to avoid starvation and make the best choice whenever an unexpected event occurs.&quot;

                              <span>Signal has had the ability to manually authenticate another account for years. iMessage is getting it:
The feature is called Contact Key Verification, and it does just what its name says: it lets you add a manual verification step in an iMessage conversation to confirm that the other person is who their device says they are. (SMS conversations lack any reliable method for verification­—sorry, green-bubble friends.) Instead of relying on Apple to verify the other person’s identity using information stored securely on Apple’s servers, you and the other party read a short verification code to each other, either in person or on a phone call. Once you’ve validated the conversation, your devices maintain a chain of trust in which neither you nor the other person has given any private encryption information to each other or Apple.

This is the moment Fortnite will transition out of its current OG guise, which has seen all-time record engagement as the game&#x27;s original map returned, and into something brand new.


The Big Bang will take place live within Fortnite on Saturday 2nd December at 7pm UK time (that&#x27;s 2pm Eastern, or 11am Pacific), with online leaks suggesting a huge music star will be making a surprise in-game appearance.

The action-adventure game is set to release on 2nd February, 2024, and the test represents a &quot;smaller, specific section of the campaign and will not be representative of the full/final experience&quot; Warner Bros. stated.
The alpha test will take place across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S from 3pm UK time on 30th November to 8am UK time on 5th December. If you&#x27;re interested in getting involved, you&#x27;ll need to register on the official Suicide Squad website.

                              <span>Court documents from the ongoing Epic Games vs Google antitrust case reveal the internet giant wanted to take over the Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer, and was willing to work with shareholder Tencent to complete a buyout.
A quick reminder of how we got here: in August 2020, Epic implemented a method to circumvent Apple and Google fees on in-game payments in the iOS and Android versions of Fortnite. The two platform-holders swiftly retaliated by pulling the game from their storefronts. Epic subsequently filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google, and the case against Apple was settled in September 2021 in favour of Apple on nine of 10 counts. Earlier this year, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulings after appeals from both parties.
Now Epic is back in court to wage its case against Google. While the court battle between Epic and Apple brought us the bizarre moment in which banana mascot Peely&#x27;s decency was questioned in (apologies, in the tuxedo he&#x27;s known as Agent Peely), so far the proceedings with Google have been revealing in a slightly different way.

                              <span>If you have been on the lookout for a new seasonal knitting project but are yet to be inspired, well, Remedy may just have exactly what you need. 


The Alan Wake 2 developer has just shared the knitting pattern for Saga Anderson&#x27;s rather fetching Nordic-inspired jumper (which was made by her mother, you know).


The cosy jumper features a festive pattern, which includes a deer and tree motif. It is ideal for this time of year, when the nights are longer and - where I live, at least - quite a lot colder.

                              <span>Two ex-Niantic employees are taking the Pokémon Go maker to court over claims of sexual bias in the workplace.


The lawsuit is set to be contested in Los Angeles tomorrow by Niantic, which is seeking to dismiss the case and move the matter into arbitration - something the company claims its former employees previously agreed to.


The legal dispute originally began in July, when a Niantic staff member left jobless by this summer&#x27;s job cull at the company alleged that it had been a &quot;boys club&quot; and that she had been paid less than a male colleague despite being in a more senior job role.

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 developer Colossal Order has delayed the release of scheduled content within the game&#x27;s expansion pass, while it continues to improve the main game&#x27;s performance.
The studio posted an updated roadmap to Steam, and Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen expanded on the decision to delay the DLC in a new developer diary.
&quot;We are committed to bringing the marketed DLC content to you,&quot; Hallikainen wrote, &quot;but it will not be landing in the originally promoted schedule.&quot; Instead, the studio is focusing on improving the game&#x27;s performance on PC before working on the delayed console release and DLC packs.

Krueger said the decision to move on was a &quot;very difficult&quot; one, but he was confident Housemarque&#x27;s &quot;brightest chapter&quot; is still ahead. 


&quot;During my 14 years at Housemarque, I&#x27;ve been incredibly fortunate to work on one dream project after another, and had the privilege of working alongside some truly talented and wonderful people along the way,&quot; Kruger wrote in a statement announcing his depature on the company&#x27;s website.

Users will be able to play up to an hour of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. 


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s trial, meanwhile, offers a more generous two hours of play time (although, given how vast the game actually is, this is really just a smidgen of the full release).

Development of the KOTOR remake has been rocky since it was first announced, and last week Lars Wingefors, CEO of Saber owner Embracer, refused to comment on the state of the game during an earnings presentation.
In response to this, Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb has stated the game is &quot;not being worked on right now&quot; according to sources close to the project. &quot;Full stop, this game is not being worked on in any way at any studio.&quot;

The company has now fully acquired nDreams for a total enterprise value close to $110m.

Bret Robbins made the statement in an interview with Windows Central, where he discussed the reception to Immortals of Aveum, the subsequent layoffs at the studio, and putting the game onto subscription services. 
Immortals of Aveum released on 22nd August 2023, which meant it was competing with the likes of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 (which &quot;no one anticipated&quot; would be so successful, Robbins said) and Armored Core 6, with Starfield releasing soon after. The studio knew Immortals&#x27; release date was in a packed window, and Robbins said &quot;trying to create awareness for us [as a new studio and IP] was really, really difficult&quot;.

                              <span>Insomniac Games&#x27; take on Wolverine is reportedly set to release in 2025 as a PlayStation 5 exclusive. 


That&#x27;s according to internet tipster DanielRPK , who is perhaps best known for their scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies.


DanielRPK said the upcoming Wolverine game will be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a much darker and more violent game than the studio&#x27;s Spider-Man titles. Additionally, the tipster has said it will feature Madripoor, Marvel&#x27;s fictional island often associated with X-Men stories (which popped up in the MCU relatively recently in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier TV series).

By spamming weapon attacks, ItsJinosaur has been able to fully customise the bathhouse/spa, arguably one of Stardew&#x27;s most overlooked, and under-used, landmarks.

&quot;The Bathhouse looked a little decrepit, so I decided to touch things up and made everything look better,&quot; ItsJinosuar explained on the game&#x27;s subreddit page.

                              <span>Respawn says it has &quot;resolved&quot; the issues that scuppered its recent rollout of cross-progression on Apex Legends.

In a message posted to social media, Respawn said that as the issues have now been addressed, it will continue &quot;rolling out more waves over the next few days&quot; but advised players not to unlink their Play Apex accounts for the time being.

&quot;We recently resolved several issues related to cross-progression and will continue rolling out more waves over the next few days,&quot; Respawn tweeted over the weekend.

                              <span>A Felix the Cat collection has popped up on the ESRB website.

As spotted by the Nintendo Switch subreddit, the collection – in which players &quot;traverse 2D pixellated environments using gadgets and vehicles to defeat small cartoony creatures&quot; – looks to be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.
Sadly, there&#x27;s no mention of an Xbox-flavoured release just yet.

                              <span>Two as yet unannounced Borderlands games have appeared on the LinkedIn profile of a former Gearbox employee.

A former studio technical director who had previously worked at Lost Boys Interactive on a three-month contract has included references to Borderlands 4 and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderland 2 on their professional profile, even though neither game has been formally confirmed.

In the director&#x27;s own words, they supervised 66 employees across the team to &quot;plan and engineer development on Borderlands 4 UE4&quot; and &quot;Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderland 2 UE4&quot;, as well as a whole of other games in Take-Two&#x27;s considerable portfolio.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has denied claims its upcoming Wonder Woman project will be a live-service game. 

A recent job listing for Warner Bros. and developer Monolith Productions&#x27; upcoming Wonder Woman game sought a &#x27;Lead Software Engineer, Gameplay&#x27;, with &quot;live software product or game&quot; experience listed as a &quot;nice to have&quot;. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, this led some to speculate that Warner Bros. might have been looking to incorporate live service elements in the upcoming title.

Confirmation came via a recruitment advertisement on Activision&#x27;s own website, in which the developer put out a call to recruit an &quot;expert UI engineer&quot; to work on Call of Duty at the new studio.

&quot;Founded in 2002, Infinity Ward is the original studio behind the Call of Duty franchise,&quot; the developer said. &quot;The titles developed by Infinity Ward have won more than 200 &#x27;Game of the Year&#x27; awards and 100 &#x27;Editor&#x27;s Choice&#x27; awards, among many other industry accolades.

                              <span>It looks like PUBG Studios&#x27; upcoming extraction shooter, Project Black Budget, will drop in the second half of 2024.

That&#x27;s according Krafton&#x27;s most recent financial report, which hints that the PvPvE shooter may release on the earlier side of its original 2024-2025 estimate. 

Project Black Budget first came to light in a different Krafton financial report earlier this year, described as a project destined to &quot;challenge ourselves to popularise the extraction shooter genre based on our PUBG production and service experience&quot;.

Numskull worked alongside Taito to &quot;accurately replicate the original 1978 and 1979 arcade cabinets&quot;, which went on sale this time last year. After quite the wait, pre-orders are now winging their way to players in the UK and Europe, and US players should expect their mini-cabinets in the next few weeks.

After signing 78 of the Space Invaders and 79 of the Space Invaders Part 2 cabinets – they released in 1978 and 1979 respectively – Nishikado spent a little time putting the machines through their paces, as captured in the brief clip below:

                              <span>Riot Games is rolling back changes it had planned to make to Riot IDs following a revolt from its own community.

Riot had originally intended to migrate all accounts to Riot ID and then restrict the number of times players could amend their IDs, as well as charge them $10 for the privilege of changing their online identifier. 

Now, however, Riot says that in response to community feedback, it has &quot;made some big updates to the plan&quot; and while it is still &quot;moving forward with Riot IDs&quot; – and Summoner names in League of Legends will be retired as planned from 20th November – it is no longer restricting players to one name change every 365 days. It will also now permit players to amend their names for free.

The free trial is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and gives you a chance to sample the opening three chapters for yourself. 

It&#x27;s unclear how long the trial will run for or whether or not your progress will carry on should you decide you like what you see and purchase the full game. You will, however, have to accept EA&#x27;s User Agreement and install the EA app in order to play, and if you decide to pay for any premium content whilst sampling the first three chapters, that won&#x27;t be refunded at the end of the trial.

                              <span>Following a swirl of reports earlier this year suggesting a new version of The Last of Us Part 2 was in the works, Naughty Dog has confirmed a remaster of its survival horror sequel - promising &quot;technological improvements, new modes, and new behind-the-scenes features&quot; - will launch for PlayStation 5 on 19th January 2024.


The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla made comments about &quot;new editions&quot; of The Last of Us Part 2 in July, and a Naughty Dog developer referenced a &quot;remastered&quot; version on LinkedIn in October. A recent PlayStation databse sighting all but gave the game away, but now it&#x27;s official, with Naughty Dog sharing the news in a post on the PlayStation Blog.


The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is a native PlayStation 5 version of the 2020 PS4 original promising various visual enhancements, including increased level-of-detail distances, improved shadow quality, better animation sampling rates, and more. It&#x27;ll feature two graphics modes - Fidelity and Performance, running at 4K and 1440p upscaled to 4K respectively - as well as an unlocked framerate option for VRR TVs.

                              <span>Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early issues with Fortnite&#x27;s newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.


Last month bought the news Epic would be introducing individual age ratings for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a &quot;multi-game ecosystem&quot;. Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its recently released Creative 2.0 tools - and the game&#x27;s latest update means all these experiences now come with age ratings, starting at E for Everyone and going through E10+ up to Teen.


So far, so sensible. The problem is the seemingly haphazard way all this has been implemented in a game that has, up until now, been exclusively rated Teen. Essentially, as of Fortnite&#x27;s latest update, every single bit of content, including all cosmetics, has been given its own age rating - and players are being prevented from accessing Creative mode experiences if they&#x27;re wearing anything flagged as age-inappropriate. It doesn&#x27;t help either, that seemingly benign cosmetics skins - a muscular cartoon cat, for instance - are rated Teen-only and considered unsuitable for children, while others, such as Halloween&#x27;s Michael Myers are rated a-okay for the young &#x27;uns.

                              <span>Seminal first-person shooter Half-Life turns 25 this weekend, and developer Valve is celebrating the occasion with a special anniversary update adding new and restored content, alongside a bunch of other things. Oh, and it&#x27;s made the game free to claim and keep starting today.


Half-Life, for those too young or too in denial to remember, introduced the world to crowbar-toting science nerd Gordon Freeman on 19th November 1998 (Freeman&#x27;s full-life consequences wouldn&#x27;t materialise until sometime later), and anyone looking to relive their memories of those halcyon days now get to do so with some fancy extra bits thrown in.


Starting with the game itself, Half-Life has received a spot of gentle massaging for the modern era. There&#x27;s UI upscaling for higher resolutions (&quot;We built most of this stuff for 640x480 CRTs and apparently some of you have upgraded since then&quot;, says Valve), and it now supports Steam Networking play and proper gamepad config &quot;out of the box&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Aspyr Media has claimed the free cut content DLC it planned to release for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 on Switch was cancelled after objections from a &quot;third-party&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to Axios, which reports Aspyr made the claim as part of an ongoing lawsuit relating to the DLC&#x27;s failure to release, which was filed by a Malachi Mickelonis earlier this year. Mickelonis argues Aspyr and publisher Saber Interactive violated California consumer law by cancelling the DLC, and intentionally deceived purchasers &quot;in order to artificially raise sales revenues...based on qualities and features that the game simply did not possess&quot;.


Aspyr announced it was cancelling Knights of the Old Republic 2&#x27;s Restored Content DLC for Switch - which was to have been based on a popular PC fan mod built from unused story content found in the original game&#x27;s code - back in June, but did not offer an explanation at the time. Now, however, court documents reviewed by Axios quote Aspyr co-CEO Ted Saloch as saying the company &quot;believed it would be able to release the content, but a third party objected and Aspyr was unable to do so.&quot;

This is over the top, but is just another example of the extreme pressure ransomware gangs put on companies after seizing their data. Gangs are now going through the data, looking for particularly important or embarrassing pieces of data to threaten executives with exposing. I have heard stories of executives’ families being threatened, of consensual porn being identified (people regularly mix work and personal email) and exposed, and of victims’ customers and partners being directly contacted. Ransoms are in the millions, and gangs do their best to ensure that the pressure to pay is intense...</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has released a five minute recap video of Final Fantasy 7 Remake ahead of the release of Rebirth.


The video, narrated by flaming beast Red XIII, uses footage from the first game to detail the story so far. The video will also be viewable from the main menu of Rebirth, or you can watch it now in the embed below.


Last week rumours suggested this sort of recap video would be included. They were right, aside from it not being a 17 minute CG film.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what it&#x27;d feel like to be back in 1999, booting up your PSX and popping in a Dark Souls disc, then modder thegreatgramcracker over on Nexus Mods has got you covered with Pixel Souls: Demastered.  
The mod takes Dark Souls Remastered and replaces textures with pixel art based on the original game&#x27;s textures, decreases model quality, and reduces the quality of music and sound effects for a &quot;fun, somewhat cursed, &#x27;retro&#x27; feel,&quot; says thegreatgramcracker.
Demakes and demasters have seen a boom over the past few years, and Dark Souls now joins the likes of other FromSoftware games, including Bloodborne and Elden Ring to receive the lo-fi treatment.

Unity 6, as announced at yesterday&#x27;s Unite event, will feature performance improvements, accelerated multiplayer game development, and an expansion of the Muse suite of AI tools that&#x27;s now in early access, reports GamesIndustry.biz.


Marc Whitten, president and general manager of Unity Create (the team responsible for the engine), also stated the company is &quot;doubling down on the areas that our creators care about the most, specifically the engine&quot;, following a fallout with developers over its controversial Runtime Fee policy.

As spotted by reputable social media account PlayStation Game Size, which is known for sourcing this type of information, a PS5 version of the PlayStation 4 exclusive has been added to the backend of the PlayStation Network. 


While The Last of Us Part 2 was enhanced for PlayStation 5 back in 2021, it was not a native port. Rumours continue to swirl that such an edition is - perhaps - on the cards.

Koichi Miura worked at Nintendo from 2019 to 2023 in game production and is now a freelance CG designer and YouTuber. On Twitter, he wrote about his experience at the company. It&#x27;s rare to see former employees openly talking in an industry which is known for a culture of keeping quiet. 
&quot;Nintendo was a great company,&quot; Miura wrote (as translated by Eurogamer), &quot;but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it lightly to others,&quot; he revealed, due to the sheer amount of talent within the company.

The game&#x27;s previous patch already made changes to increase the challenge of certain bosses. Now further tweaks have been made more broadly.


&quot;It was clear (both from your feedback and our internal findings) that many bosses simply weren&#x27;t posing enough of a challenge, so we have rebalanced some behaviours, as well as their hit points and damage output, to ensure they pose the correct level of difficulty at that point in your journey,&quot; read the patch notes on reddit from Hexworks.

During a recent earnings presentation for the Swedish conglomerate, Wingefors was asked how he was feeling about the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. As a reminder, this remake was first announced back in 2021.


However, rather than providing an update on its fate, the CEO simply stated: &quot;I notice that anything I say to this becomes a headline, so that is my only comment.&quot;

                              <span>Six month after its initial release, developer Arkane&#x27;s beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received a third major patch, this one primarily focusing on performance improvements and fixes, although it does add a tiny bit of new content in the form of a gun.


Specifically, Redfall players now have access to the Basilisk, an Unrivaled Sniper Rifle that can charge the first bullet in a full magazine with UV power to petrify Vampires. It can be found in locations where Unrivaled items spawn, but is most likely to drop from Bellwether-themed containers in the open-world or vampire nests.


Beyond the Basilisk, Redfall&#x27;s latest update brings bug fixes, balance improvements, and more - as detailed in its patch notes - touching on all aspects of the game, including AI and NPCs, gameplay and missions, heroes, UI, audio, and accessibility. Performance and stability is also a focus, with Arkane promising &quot;various performance fixes related to FPS drops and stuttering.&quot;

                              <span>If you love Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 so much you just want to hug it and kiss it and tuck it under your pillow at night (understandable), you&#x27;re going to want to start priming your puckering lips for action; developer Larian has announced it&#x27;ll be releasing a fancy physical edition of its acclaimed RPG for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC early next year.


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 will be entering the corporeal realm in the guise of a special Deluxe Edition containing a whole bunch of physical goodies. There&#x27;s the game itself, which comes on three discs for Xbox Series X/S, two discs for PS5, and a single DVD on PC - although that just contains a custom downloader app with an accompanying Steam key.


Moving onto the fancier physical stuff, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Deluxe Edition include three CDs containing the game&#x27;s original soundtrack, a double-sided map, two patches sporting Flaming Fist and Mark of the Absolute designs, a minder flayer poster, plus 32 stickers featuring the game&#x27;s origin characters, some iconic D&amp;D monsters and more.

                              <span>Thomas Waterzooi, developer of cosy painting-based puzzler Please, Touch the Artwork, has announced a sequel is in the works.


Known as Please, Touch the Artwork 2, this upcoming release will continue its predecessor&#x27;s &quot;tradition of immersing players in the captivating realm of a renowned modern artist&quot; as they help a skeleton painter &quot;find his way back home&quot;. 


Where the first game featured art by Piet Mondrian, the artist Waterzooi has focused on for this next release is James Ensor. Players will be able to look for hidden objects within Ensor&#x27;s works when the game releases &quot;early&quot; next year. We will update you with an exact date when we know more.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s remake trilogy will ultimately link up with Advent Children, making the film part of the remake canon.


Tetsuya Nomura, creative director for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, previously told The Guardian the games would link up to Advent Children. Now, speaking to Games Radar, producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed once again the link to Square Enix&#x27;s sequel film and discussed balancing the original story with new revisions.


&quot;We are finally going to link up with Advent Children, that is going to be part of canon,&quot; said Kitase. &quot;The overall storyline, the developments, will not go wildly out in a way that will not add up to Advent Children in the end. I don&#x27;t think anyone wanted that, that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re looking to create here.

Sony has introduced Star Ratings on the PS Store, meaning players can get an idea of how any given game has been received by fellow players before making a purchase. 


As you can see in the screenshots below, the likes of Robocop: Rogue City has a 4.53 star rating on the PlayStation Store. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, meanwhile, only has 2.59.

The game was revealed at the Nintendo Direct in September and is from the team behind 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, which received glowing reviews when it released in 2020.

                              <span>PUBG publisher Krafton has revealed more information on the mobile version of Dark and Darker, along with the first gameplay reveal.

Dark and Darker Mobile was first announced by Krafton in August, once the game finally launched into early access after months of legal battles between developer Ironmace and publisher Nexon.
Visitors to G-Star 2023, an exhibition held in South Korea which runs from today to 19th November, are able to play a demo of the game. Krafton has uploaded gameplay footage from the demo for those who aren&#x27;t able to attend - you can watch it below.

As part of the studio&#x27;s interim report, Starbreeze called Payday 3&#x27;s launch a &quot;milestone&quot; for the company, adding that &quot;both interest in the game and initial sales exceeded [its] expectations&quot;. It then went on to address the reception Payday 3 has since received. 


As previously reported, the game was plagued with matchmaking issues at launch and online-only requirements. Meanwhile, its first promised &#x27;big&#x27; patch received several delays, before finally going live earlier this month.

                              <span>Sonic and Persona publisher Sega has been accused of threatening some of its unionised workers with layoffs, and is now facing an unfair labour practice complaint filed by the Communications Workers of America.
In a new report from Kotaku, on 6th November Sega of America is said to have brought union members into a meeting where they were told of a proposal to &quot;phase out&quot; all temporary employees by February 2024.
The union, Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS-CWA), has filed a complaint with the National Labour Relations Board in response, for making affected employees attend a mandatory meeting to deliver the news rather than bargain with the union as a whole. This could be a violation of the rule which states companies must not negotiate directly with unionised employees instead of with their union.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended Xbox Series X/S release has been delayed again.


Studio Wildcard&#x27;s souped-up version of its dinosaur survival game was meant to launch on Microsoft&#x27;s consoles earlier this week, having previously been expected in August. However, it was delayed at the final hour to an unspecified date, with the studio simply saying it would be released at some point &quot;this week&quot;. At this time, Studio Wildcard said it would update us with a release date before then. 


It has now issued an update but rather than saying &quot;hazaar, it is finally here&quot;, the studio has instead announced another delay. Again, the studio has not put an exact date on when Xbox Series X/S players can expect to see Ark: Survival Ascended arrive on consoles. It has simply said it is now &quot;targeting&quot; a release sometime early next week.

The company is in the midst of a &quot;comprehensive restructuring programme&quot; it announced in June to close studios and cut jobs, to transform the company into &quot;a leaner, stronger, more focused and cash self-sufficient company&quot;.



In the company&#x27;s latest financial report, Wingefors provided an update on restructuring progress, acknowledging the company&#x27;s &quot;first ever quarter-over-quarter reduction in headcount&quot;.

In addition, developer Ubisoft is also going to introduce an optional permadeath mode to the game. This new challenge will be available across all difficulty levels, the studio has said. 


Other than that, details are still quite thin on the ground. The Mirage team is yet to go into more about what either new mode will actually involve, but we do know that it will all be coming next month.

                              <span>Fortnite has added the ability to submit voice recordings when reporting players for violations of the game&#x27;s community rules, which cover instances of abusive or inappropriate behaviour.


Epic Games&#x27; voice reporting system works by recording the last five minutes of game chat audio on a rolling basis, saved to your local device (your PC or game console). Reports of inappropriate behaviour can now include that audio so Epic can hear evidence for itself and swiftly bring down the banhammer.


A detailed technical blog lays out how Epic has come up with a series of policies over when it stores any data you choose to upload, and when voice reporting will be enabled (you can switch it off, but only if you&#x27;re over 18 and playing in parties with friends with similar settings).

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was originally due to launch in 2022 but has been delayed twice since then, most recently following the game&#x27;s controversial gameplay debut, with Warner Bros. announcing it was pushing its release back to 2nd February 2024 in order to make it &quot;the best quality experience for players&quot;.


Eight months on, Suicide Squad has reemerged with a new Insider video series, its initial offering featuring 20 minutes of new gameplay  highlighting traversal mechanics, story elements, and a brief glimpse at the game&#x27;s rendition of Metropolis.

                              <span>A recently sighted job listing for Warner Bros. and developer Monolith Productions&#x27; upcoming Wonder Woman game has hinted it&#x27;ll be a live service title.


Monolith&#x27;s Wonder Woman was announced during 2021&#x27;s The Game Awards, where it was described a single-player open-world action game. As spotted by Wccftech, however, a recent advert seeking a &#x27;Lead Software Engineer, Gameplay&#x27; for the title on Monolith&#x27;s website has hinted that Warner Bros. may be looking to incorporate live service elements.


The ad, which talks of helping to &quot;deliver a superhero experience as epic as Wonder Woman herself&quot;, includes a list of daily duties associated with the job, alongside essential experience. The relevant part for this story, though, is listed under &quot;nice to haves&quot;, wherein Monolith indicates &quot;experience helping maintain a live software product or game&quot; will be beneficial.

                              <span>Xbox Series X/S owners eager for a Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 release date announcement will have a little longer to wait; developer Larian Studios has confirmed it&#x27;ll be sharing the news during this year&#x27;s Geoff-Keighley-hosted The Game Awards on 8th December.


Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s journey to Xbox has, of course, been a bit of a bumpy one; Larian confirmed the acclaimed RPG would be coming Microsoft&#x27;s platform back February, amid fan fears the game was a PlayStation console exclusive, but noted it had &quot;run into some technical issues - particularly with split-screen co-op.&quot;


The developer&#x27;s struggles implementing split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S have continued as the year has gone on, meaning Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 hit PC and PlayStation 5 in August with still no word of an Xbox release date. Eventually, though, after hashing things out with Xbox boss Phil Spencer, Larian confirmed a &quot;solution&quot; had been found: it would be dropping split-screen co-op for Series S until a later date to ensure the RPG hit Xbox before the end of the year.

For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that a large portion of cryptographic keys used to protect data in computer-to-server SSH traffic are vulnerable to complete compromise when naturally occurring computational errors occur while the connection is being established.
[…]
The vulnerability occurs when there are errors during the signature generation that takes place when a client and server are establishing a connection. It affects only keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm, which the researchers found in roughly a third of the SSH signatures they examined. That translates to roughly 1 billion signatures out of the 3.2 billion signatures examined. Of the roughly 1 billion RSA signatures, about one in a million exposed the private key of the host...</span>

As with every release, Kubernetes v1.29 will introduce feature deprecations and removals. Our continued ability to produce high-quality releases is a testament to our robust development cycle and healthy community. The following are some of the deprecations and removals coming in the Kubernetes 1.29 release.
The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it w…</span>

There’s been quite a lot of posts suggesting that not using Kubernetes resource limits might be a fairly useful thing (for example, For the Love of God, Stop Using CPU Limits on Kubernetes or Kubernetes: Make your services faster by removing CPU limits ). The points made there are totally valid – it doesn’t make much sense to pay for compute power that will not be used due to limits, nor to artificially increase latency. This post strives to argue that limits have their legitimate use as well.
As a Site Reliability Engineer on the Grafana Labs platform team, which maintains and improves internal infrastructure and tooling used by the product teams, I primarily try to make Kubernetes upgrades as smooth as possible. But I also spend a lot of time going down…</span>

                              <span>Fortnite, which is currently riding high on the nostalgia of a generation pining for the good old days of five years ago, is extending its Icons line of cosmetics this Friday, 17th November, with the arrival of celebrated F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and his bulldog Roscoe.


Hamilton joins a steadily growing number of noted sports stars and celebrities to be turned into Fortnite skins as part of the Icons series, including Naomi Osaka, Chloe Kim, LeBron James, Neymar Jr., Ariana Grande, Bruno Mars, and Marshmello.


News of Hamilton&#x27;s imminent Fortnite debut was accompanied by a trailer featuring the F1 star wandering around (for some reason) a hall of mirrors then launching himself at a vaguely cat-like superhero outfit before plunging into the world of Fortnite - whereupon the outfit had magically wrapped itself around Hamilton&#x27;s digital frame.

                              <span>If you have played through Alan Wake 2, you will by no doubt be well aware of its musical number. In fact, even if you haven&#x27;t played it, you may also be aware of this particular moment. It has become quite popular online.


Before I go further though, if you have no idea what I am talking about and want to keep as much of Alan Wake 2 a surprise, please head elsewhere now. I do not want to spoil this moment for you. 


OK, so, for those of you who are still with me, I am of course talking about Herald of Darkness by Old Gods of Asgard (AKA Poets of the Fall). It is an absolute tune, and honestly, for me, this song is the best part of Alan Wake 2 (so far at least, I am still not quite finished).

According to the official Witcher social media account, this editor will allow users to create their own experiences in the game &quot;by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content&quot;. 


The team said the mod editor will release some time next year, but did not state any timeframe. It did, however, say when it does release it will be free.

                              <span>Starfield released a little over two months ago on PC and Xbox. However, despite a strong start which saw Starfield become the &quot;biggest Bethesda game launch&quot; of all time, things have tailed off a bit now. In fact, there are currently more people playing Bethesda&#x27;s earlier RPG, Skyrim, over on Steam. 


At the time of writing, there are currently 1610 Steam users playing through 2011&#x27;s Skyrim release, and 13,776 playing 2016&#x27;s Special Edition release. That makes a total of 15,386 Skyrimmers at the present time. 


Both releases combined have a 24-hour player peak of 25,181. If we pop in the VR players as well, that number is higher still.

                              <span>The new Turok 3 remaster has slipped out earlier than planned in Europe and Australia, following confusion over the game&#x27;s recently-delayed launch date. 


For fans here in Europe, this means the game is available now but contains bugs and lacks quality-of-life improvements which developer Nightdive Studios had intended to remedy in the version of the game set to officially launch elsewhere in two weeks&#x27; time.


For fans elsewhere, such as in the US and Canada, Turok 3 is still due to launch on 30th November with those final tweaks included.

                              <span>Lies of P has received a new update that adds a number of new features and tweaks.


The game will now be a little easier in the early stages, thanks to adjusted attack speed of some monsters in the field and increased stance break duration, more Quartz available earlier on, and the Rising Dodge now a default ability.


Further, balance adjustments have been made to combat, with some weapons now dealing increased damage, plus lighter blades gaining more Guard Regain and heavier blades gaining less.

                              <span>Kaitlyn Dever is reportedly in talks to star as Abby in the second season of The Last of Us. 


That&#x27;s according to a new report by journalist and critic Jeff Sneider, who is known for their film and TV industry scoops. 


Sources familiar with the project said Dever was poised to land the role of Abby thanks to her performance in No One Will Save You, an alien invasion movie which premiered on Hulu back in September. However, she is perhaps better known for role as Amy Antsler in Booksmart.

That&#x27;s according to Ryu Ga Gotoku studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama, who discussed the forthcoming game&#x27;s length in an interview with Japanese website Game Watch (translated by Automaton Media).


&quot;If you go at it continuously, you&#x27;ll get sick, and it won&#x27;t end with just one or two all-nighters,&quot; said Yokoyama of Infinite Wealth.

                              <span>Video games publisher Humble Games has announced layoffs at the company. 


Humble staff members first discussed the layoffs via social media yesterday, as they began looking for new jobs. It&#x27;s still unconfirmed how many people are affected.


In a statement to Videogames.si, which first reported the layoffs, Humble confirmed it had said &quot;goodbye to valued coleagues&quot; and blamed the job losses on industry &quot;trends&quot;.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended - Studio Wildcard&#x27;s controversial Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up of its dinosaur-themed survival game - will no longer launch for Xbox Series X/S on 15th November as originally announced, with the developer now hoping to release the game &quot;later this week&quot;.


Ark: Survival Ascended is no stranger to delays, of course; the full-price upgrade - which is mandatory for players wishing to continue using Wildcard&#x27;s official servers - was originally due to launch in August but was delayed to October after Wildcard admitted it &quot;found it challenging working with Unreal Engine 5.2&quot;.


October did eventually see the release of Ark: Survival Ascended on PC (albeit with a heap of performance problems), but its arrival was accompanied by a further delay for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, with both versions being pushed back to an unspecified point in &quot;November&quot;. Wildcard finally slapped the Xbox version with a 15th November release date last week (the PS5 edition remains TBA), but that&#x27;s now slipped again too.

As per its own recent figures, Digital Bros currently employs 442 people across the company, meaning its newly announced layoffs will likely impact around 130 workers.


The company says it&#x27;s making the cuts after reviewing projects across its development studios and publishing units - which include 505, Assetto Corsa developer Kunos Simulazioni, Puzzle Quest studio Infinity Plus Two, and Terraria mobile developer DR Studios - in order to &quot;align with the evolving competitive environment [and] ensure maximum operational efficiency.&quot;

                              <span>Netflix has confirmed its new stop-motion Pokémon series, Pokémon Concierge, will release on 28th December this year - and there&#x27;s a fresh two-minute trailer to accompanying the news.


Pokémon Concierge, which was announced at the Pokémon Presents showcase back in February, follows the adventures of Haru, a new concierge at a southern island hotel resort for Pokémon. According to Netflix&#x27;s brief blurb for the show, Haru &quot;gradually discovers herself as she and her fellow staff members scramble to attend to the various Pokémon guests.&quot;


&quot;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all [felt like] we are bombarded, under pressure, or that we don&#x27;t want to get up and keep doing what we&#x27;ve been doing and just give up,&quot; Haru&#x27;s voice actor Rena Nōnen said of Pokémon Concierge back in July, &quot;But when you see [the show], it&#x27;s really therapeutic and it makes you want to try and be the best you can be.&quot;

                              <span>If it&#x27;s indies you want, you&#x27;re in luck (as long as you&#x27;re specifically wanting them on Switch); Nintendo has aired another instalment of its Indie World showcase, this time bringing news of a canceled Shantae revival, plague-themed turn-based tactics, a launch date for developer Inkle&#x27;s gorgeous hiking adventure A Highland Song, news of Outer Wilds&#x27; long-awaited Switch release, and more. If you&#x27;re looking to catch up on the excitement, or simply need a reminder, you&#x27;ll find a full breakdown of everything featured during the show below.


Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution sees developer WayForward reviving the cancelled Game Boy Advance instalment of its acclaimed platform series nearly two decades on. To progress through its challenges, players will need to take advantage of Shantae&#x27;s animal transformation abilities, as well as her newfoud power to rearrange stages by switching the foreground and background, and it&#x27;ll also feature a 4-player local battle mode when it launches next year.


Developer Pugstorm&#x27;s Core Keeper is a &quot;mining sandbox adventure&quot; for up to eight players set in an &quot;endless&quot; procedurally generated cave system. There&#x27;s an ancient mystery to be solved, but doing so requires players to hone their survival skills by mining for relics and resources, building bases, growing crops, and hatching pets, as they push further into the subtarrenean world and take on its monsters. This one&#x27;s due to release for Switch in summer 2024.

                              <span>A Highland Song, the beautiful &quot;open platforming&quot; adventure from Heaven&#x27;s Vault and 80 Days developer Inkle, is almost here and will be launching for Switch and PC on 5th December.


A Highland Song tells the story of teenager Moira McKinnon who one day decides to run away from her life of relative seclusion in a small house on the edge of the Scottish Highlands, after recieving a letter from her Uncle Hamish, inviting her to his lighthouse on the coast.


What follows is yet another genre shift for the ever-ambitious Inkle. This time, the acclaimed studio - which has previously dabbled in the likes of visual novels, turn-based strategy, exploratory adventuring, and murder mystery - is combining its acclaimed narrative expertise with 2.5D platforming, as Moira sets off on a journey across the Highlands, where &quot;every peak has a story to tell and every valley echoes with song.&quot;

                              <span>Satisfactory developer Coffee Stain Studios has released a new update for the Early Access game which upgrades it to Unreal Engine 5.


Players have been able to try out this version of the factory-building sim for some time in an Experimental branch, allowing the developers to fine tune performance improvements. Now it&#x27;s available for all on both Steam and the Epic Games Store.


The upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 allows for a more stable foundation for future features, Coffee Stain has said, as well as a new lighting system, vehicle and sound overhauls, and additional granular keybind options.

                              <span>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle, which also includes three months of Nintendo Switch Online. 


It&#x27;s set to launch next Monday 20th November - just in time for Black Friday - priced €349 at select retailers or direct from Nintendo via the My Nintendo Store. 


A Nintendo Switch bundle featuring Mario Kart 8 has become something of a Black Friday staple - though previous years have featured a regular launch model Switch rather than the improved OLED upgrade.

The heists in question are Cook off and Turbid Station. Starbreeze says their arrival will allow players to &quot;relive the thrill and excitement&quot; of the previous game&#x27;s heists, but with a slight reimagining and improved gameplay.

                              <span>A familiar Modern Warfare 3 skin is once again playing havoc in the game&#x27;s multiplayer modes,  prompting complaints from players.

Modern Warfare 3 allows players to transfer a &quot;vast amount&quot; of their previously acquired Modern Warfare 2 content over to this year&#x27;s Call of Duty release - including the controversial Gaia operator skin, which could be acquired as part of Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s Blackcell Battle Pass bundles. This has been dubbed the Groot skin within the community given its likeness to Marvel&#x27;s sentient tree-like creature. 


The Gaia skin is described by Activision as an &quot;ancient goddess of considerable power, [that] uses her earthen form to inspire ruin in her enemies&quot;. As you can see from the header image above, it is incredibly dark and see-through in places, making it almost indistinguishable from many of the surroundings in Modern Warfare&#x27;s multiplayer maps (both 2 and 3).

To recap, here&#x27;s what&#x27;s joining Game Pass for the rest of the month:
As always, the arrival of these new games means that others will be leaving Game Pass soon. All of the following will no longer be available after 30th November:

                              <span>Lara Croft is coming to Magic: The Gathering as part of an upcoming Secret Lair x Tomb Raider collaboration. 


This collaboration will see six cards and a new treasure token making their way to the trading card game. Five of these cards are familiar Magic cards which have been re-imagined with artwork from the Tomb Raider games.


The cards themselves feature scenes from across the series, with the likes of Rise of the Tomb Raider&#x27;s Kitezh and the original/Anniversary game&#x27;s Lost Valley making a showing. There is also an equipment card for Totec&#x27;s Spear (from Guardian of Light), while Lara&#x27;s bow features as The Grim Whisperer.

Last night, The Game Awards revealed its nominees for the upcoming event, which is set to take place on Thursday 7th December. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 received multiple nominations this year, including Game of the Year, Best Game Direction and Best Narrative.


 Sharing its delight, Larian said it was &quot;extremely proud&quot; to see its game nominated across the various categories. It then closed with a little tease: &quot;Xbox fans, and fans of physical media, watch this space for a formal announcement. It&#x27;s going to be a busy week.&quot;

Official mod support and mod tools will be added to the game as an all-in-one Editor, which publisher Paradox previously confirmed wouldn&#x27;t be present at launch. 
In the latest developer diary from Colossal Order, CEO Mariina Hallikainen said the studio expected to need at least a couple more months to get the Editor &quot;in a shape where we can release it&quot;.

&quot;We&#x27;ve listened to our customers and we know delivering free games every month is what they want most, so we are refining our Prime benefit to increase our focus there,&quot; wrote Christoph Hartmann, VP of Amazon Games in an internal email shared with Aftermath.

The game will be published by Tencent, but &quot;due to uncertainties in creating a successful game to the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks&quot;, both companies have &quot;discussed a new direction&quot; for the project.


It&#x27;s got a new codename too: Kestrel.

The winner will also receive a regular black Xbox wireless controller, as the chocolate controller presumably can&#x27;t be used with the console. 
This is the first-ever &quot;official edible&quot; Xbox controller, the company notes, which begs the question - who is making unofficial edible Xbox controllers and out of what? Chocolate would be my last choice. Surely it&#x27;ll melt really quickly in your hands?

                              <span>The detachable disc drive for the new PS5 &quot;slim&quot; models will easily pair to different consoles and won&#x27;t be locked to a particular console once it&#x27;s been paired, according to a new video showing the hardware in action.
The disc drive was shown in action by YouTuber Mystic in a PS5 slim unboxing video, in which he walked through the process of pairing the drive with a console. 
The disc drive will easily pair to a console, even if it&#x27;s already registered to a different one and the console has its own disc drive registered.

A post on X, formerly Twitter, from Nintendo this afternoon stated that tomorrow&#x27;s broadcast would last 20 minutes, and feature &quot;new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch&quot;.

The speedrunner, Weedmoder, currently holds the world record time of 50 minutes and 30 seconds and shared a video of the run online (thanks VG247).



Of course, the speedrun involves banging the bear, aka druid Halsin. That means completing his romance questline, which cannot be done until Act 3.

Titled Content Streaming With Gameplay Launch, the patent was filed on 11th July 2023 and publically published on 2nd November via WIPO (spotted by Exputer).

It describes a game which contains multiple &quot;trigger points of media content&quot;. These are moments which the player could start a replay from, which would be provided &quot;by the platform, publisher, or third-party publisher&quot;. These trigger points are described as the start of an &quot;activity&quot; such as a boss battle or quest, or when a player levels up.

Reina is the 32nd and final fighter to join the upcoming release&#x27;s roster, but, as is always the case, last is certainly not the least. Her character promises lightning fast moves, and a mysterious interest in Jin. Why does she want to fight him so badly? We will have to wait to find out.


You can watch Reina&#x27;s Tekken 8 introduction trailer below.

Quarry, Rundown and Scrapyard were removed from the game&#x27;s Hardpoint playlists last Thursday, 9th November, after players complained. In a post on its bug-tracking social media account, Activision acknowledged &quot;an issue causing unfavourable spawns&quot;. 


Karachi was next to go last Friday, 10th November - binned from Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s Cutthroat playlist while Activision, it said, worked to &quot;resolve an issue causing a player to spawn alongside enemies&quot;.

&quot;It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I&#x27;m sincerely grateful,&quot; said the player on reddit. &quot;This marks the end of a chapter but I just wanted to say, thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the players that summoned me.&quot;

                              <span>PlayStation 5 accounted for 51 percent of all console sales in the UK over the past six months.


Sony&#x27;s latest console held a 43 percent share on all console sales between November 2022 and October 2023, according to UK chart firm GfK (via Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz).  But hone in on the last six months and the PS5&#x27;s sales account for just over 50 percent of all console purchases since May.


GfK games boss Dorian Bloch said these figures are a result of various price promotions held over the summer months, the console&#x27;s recent EA Sports FC bundle and, of course, &quot;unrestricted sales&quot; on the standard PlayStation 5 model. Unlike previous years, there are currently no supply and stock shortages for Sony&#x27;s PS5 console here in the UK.

                              <span>UK boxed sales for Modern Warfare 3 fell 25 percent short on last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 launch.


That&#x27;s according to UK sales figures shared by numbers company GFK (via GamesIndustry.biz). 80 percent of boxed sales were on PlayStation, with 20 percent on Xbox.


The new Modern Warfare 3 marks the first time Activision Blizzard has double dipped on the same Call of Duty sub-brand two years running to immediately release a direct sequel to the previous year&#x27;s game. But controversy has swirled around the game&#x27;s development and release.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players have discovered a strange bug that essentially traps players against an invisible wall, stopping them from moving and leaving them exposed to competitors.

The issue – which has been around for some time now – chiefly affects players on the Colosseo map, and sees players get trapped. Without the help of characters like Lifeweaver of Mei&#x27;s movement abilities to bump them out of position, they&#x27;ll stay trapped, too.

Despite many players reporting they&#x27;ve also been stuck in this exact spot as a myriad of different players, it doesn&#x27;t look like Blizzard&#x27;s yet been able to address the problem.

It&#x27;s left fans wondering how NetherRealm will implement Homelander, and who will be the voice behind the character when he joins as a guest fighter next year.

&quot;My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined,&quot; lamented one unhappy fan in a comment that has been upvoted hundreds of times.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence will change so many aspects of society, largely in ways that we cannot conceive of yet. Democracy, and the systems of governance that surround it, will be no exception. In this short essay, I want to move beyond the “AI-generated disinformation” trope and speculate on some of the ways AI will change how democracy functions—in both large and small ways.
When I survey how artificial intelligence might upend different aspects of modern society, democracy included, I look at four different dimensions of change: speed, scale, scope, and sophistication. Look for places where changes in degree result in changes of kind. Those are where the societal upheavals will happen...</span>

There&#x27;s been no formal confirmation from either Sony or then-publisher THQ that the family favourite adventure game was coming to current-gen Sony systems.

The statement comes days after Bloomberg broke the news that employees needed to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period.

&quot;We’re incredibly proud of Modern Warfare 3 – both the full game experience at launch and the upcoming year of content we have planned for the community,&quot; said Sledgehammer&#x27;s studio head, Aaron Halon.

As spotted by Naruki on X/Twitter, players who&#x27;ve already pre-ordered the remake from the eShop have discovered that ArtePiazza - perhaps best known for its work on Square Enix&#x27;s Dragon Quest series - has taken the reigns, with Nintendo&#x27;s Ayako Moriwaki stepping into the director role.

That said, some of the inaugural developers who worked on the 1996 original have also been credited in the game, including co-director Yoshihiko Maekawa, composer Yoko Shimomura, and designer Taro Kudo.

                              <span>This week we learned that Nintendo is developing a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, but did you know that an animated movie almost brought Hyrule to life back in 2007?

Ten years ago now, Forbes – as spotted by The Digital Fix – shared a concept trailer for a CG Legend of Zelda movie. Created by Netflix&#x27;s The Sea Beast&#x27;s Adam Holmes, it shows Link sweeping in to save Princess Zelda from a gaggle of evil Bokoblins.  

You can watch the brief pitch teaser below:

                              <span>Netflix has revealed Doug Cockle - the gravelly voice of Geralt of Rivia in CD Projekt&#x27;s The Witcher series - will be reprising his role as the silver-haired monster-bopper in a new animated movie coming to the streaming service &quot;late&quot; next year.


The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, as the film is officially titled, begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. However, as answers are slowly revealed, Geralt finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.


&quot;He must count on friends — old and new,&quot; Netflix teases in its announcement, &quot;to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting Nightdive Studios&#x27; Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion remaster, you&#x27;ll need to hang in there just a bit longer; the developer is delaying its release by a few weeks, with the dino FPS now coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 30th November.


Nightdive&#x27;s remastering of the original Turok trilogy - which was developed by the now-defunct Iguana Entertainment - has been quite the undertaking; the studio released its Turok 1 remaster eight years ago, back in 2015, and its sequel got the spruce-up treatment two years later. 


Nightdive&#x27;s Turok 3 remaster - which will mark the first time the game has been available since its N64 debut in 2000 - promises to be similarly thorough, introducing enhanced environment art and character models, updated weapon models, plus &quot;advanced rendering features&quot; that&#x27;ll include anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has attempted to placate angry Mortal Kombat 1 players with two &#x27;free&#x27; Fatalities following an outcry caused by the decision to introduce a $10 USD Fatality animation to the game&#x27;s already heavily criticised premium store.


Despite being sold as a full-price title costing £59.99/$69.99 USD, the latest entry in developer NetherRealm&#x27;s long-running fighting series features a rotational in-game shop selling store-exclusive cosmetics - including costumes and gear - only available to purchase with real-world money (in contrast, Mortal Kombat 11 also enabled players to buy cosmetics, but these could largely also be earned by completing activities in-game).


While Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s premium store has already drawn plenty of ire from players, things came to a head last month when Warner Bros. and developer NetherRealm began selling a store-exclusive Halloween Fatality animation for $10. To put that in some kind of perspective, $20 would get you several DLC characters in Mortal Kombat 11.

                              <span>Whatever you might think of Call of Duty, you can&#x27;t accuse its anti-cheat team of lacking imagination; having previously caused chaos for multiplayer cheaters by whisking away their weapons and turning opponents invisible, it&#x27;ll soon be cutting their parachute cords and causing their bunny hops to launch them 10,000ft into the air before a very messy end.


This latest bit of mischief is the work of the team behind Call of Duty&#x27;s server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, officially known as Ricochet, which outlined its latest steps in the war against online ne&#x27;er-do-wells - particularly the role Machine Learning plays in improving its anti-cheat systems - in a timely blog post coinciding with today&#x27;s launch of Modern Warfare 3.


&quot;Combining everything [we have] developed over the course of the last two years with new Machine Learning advancements,&quot; it wrote, &quot;Richochet: Anti-Cheat is preparing for the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 with a stronger and faster process to combat cheating.&quot;

                              <span>Mass Effect fans have been debating a recent claim that the next game in the series may not launch until 2029.


This week, Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb suggested Mass Effect 5 would not arrive until near the end of the decade, based on insider knowledge and some back of the envelope maths based on the ongoing and protracted development of Dragon Age Dreadwolf.


Grubb&#x27;s comments were predictably pounced upon by fans following a somewhat mixed response to this year&#x27;s annual Mass Effect franchise celebrations on 7th November - N7 Day.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto has admitted Nintendo faces &quot;an extremely high hurdle&quot; not to disappoint fans across the world with the forthcoming film.


Following the company&#x27;s latest earnings report, Miyamoto and CEO Shuntaro Furukawa were asked about the risks of expanding IPs beyond video games, to which Miyamoto responded directly on the Zelda live-action film that was announced during the report.



&quot;Regarding the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, I know we face an extremely high hurdle in producing a film that will not disappoint the global fan base,&quot; he said. &quot;With this challenge in mind, I have been discussing this project with Avi Arad, Chairman of Arad Productions Inc., for about 10 years.&quot;

                              <span>Twitch is removing its controversial Hype Chat feature, based on &quot;community feedback&quot;.

Hype Chat was a feature launched in June that allowed viewers to pay to have messages pinned at the top of a streamer&#x27;s chat window.



Now, just five months later, it&#x27;s being deprecated from 15th November and instead Twitch will invest more into Cheering and Bits.

This is thanks to a new partnership between Paramount and Microsoft. It means those of us here in Blighty will be able to watch the TV version of Halo (via an app and with a Paramount Plus subscription) on the same platform we play the video game version of Halo.

                              <span>Activision has claimed its Call of Duty HQ launcher provides easier file management and seamless switching between games, despite criticism from players.


Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, the latest in the series, now launches from Call of Duty HQ alongside last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2. Activision describes the launcher as &quot;the front door for Call of Duty&quot; and states &quot;players have control over the footprint of their Call of Duty experience on their platform of choice, and it&#x27;s all contained within one unified location&quot;.


In practice, however, it&#x27;s confusing plenty of players and has resulted in huge file sizes - as previously reported, the install size of the complete package is over 200GB on some platforms.

Larian&#x27;s own Swen Vincke recently shared a rather welcome update with his followers over on X (formerly Twitter). In a new post, the CEO shared two graphs showing how RAM and VRAM loads for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Series S port have been reduced in recent weeks. 

&quot;Got a nice present from our engineers. Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back. I think this will benefit all platforms too,&quot; he wrote to accompany the two graphs (which you can see via the embed below).

Back at BlizzCon last week, The War Within expansion was revealed along with two further expansions to begin the multi-part Worldsoul Saga. However, the Epic edition (costing $89.99) includes guaranteed beta access and three days of early access, the first time Warcraft has offered this.


Fans have responded angrily, as per this reddit thread, but Hazzikostas said the studio is following a trend.

                              <span>A new report claims Modern Warfare 3 was developed in just 16 months. That&#x27;s roughly half the time of a standard Call of Duty release. 


More than a dozen employees at developer Sledgehammer shared their experiences working on the Modern Warfare 2 sequel with Bloomberg - in particular the need to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period. 


Meanwhile, sources said that Modern Warfare 3 initially started out as an expansion to last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 - something that was previously suggested. This expansion, which was codenamed Jupiter, was reportedly going to be set solely in Mexico, rather than a globe spanning release the Call of Duty series is typically known for.

                              <span>Unity is &quot;likely&quot; to announce layoffs as part of broader cost cutting measures.


As noted in the company&#x27;s Q3 earnings report, Unity is assessing its product portfolio &quot;to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers&quot; and is &quot;evaluating the right cost structure that aligns with the more focused portfolio&quot;.


Changes will be completed before the end of Q1 in 2024, which will &quot;likely include discontinuing certain product offerings, reducing our workforce, and reducing our office footprint&quot; (thanks The Verge).

                              <span>It&#x27;s been just over two years since acclaimed animated League of Legends spin-off Arcane launched on Netflix, but finally its long-awaited second season has the closest thing to a release date yet. The bad news is there&#x27;s still a long wait in store; the streaming service has now confirmed Arcane season two will launch in November 2024.


The first season of Arcane told the story of sisters Jinx and Vi - two of League of Legends most popular champions - as they find themselves caught on different sides of a conflict between the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun, which hits boiling point after the invention of Hextech technology.


Hailee Steinfeld and Ella Purnell will reprise their roles as Vi and Jinx in Arcane&#x27;s upcoming second season - which fans have been waiting for since it was confirmed to be happening shortly after the release of season one - with Katie Leung also set to return as Caitlyn Kiramman.

                              <span>Warframe developer Digital Extremes has confirmed a &quot;number of&quot; layoffs at the studio resulting from the closure of its publishing division. It&#x27;s also announced it&#x27;ll no longer be publishing free-to-play online action-RPG Wayfinder following the closure, and that full control of the property will return to developer Airship Syndicate.


In a statement provided to Eurogamer after news of layoffs at the studio was broken via PC Gamer, Digital Extremes wrote, &quot;We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division.&quot;


&quot;We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result,&quot; the statement continued, &quot;and we&#x27;re working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in the coming months.&quot;

                              <span>Remnant 2&#x27;s first expansion, The Awakened King, is right around the corner, and ahead of its release next Tuesday, 14th November, developer Gunfire Games has revealed a second copy of the DLC won&#x27;t be required to play it with a friend.


The Awakened King, to provide a bit of context, introduces a new storyline focusing on the Root-corrupted (and decidedly peeved) One True King. It&#x27;ll see players attempting to uncover his secrets by exploring the seaside town of the Forlorn Coast, a new area of Losomn containing dungeons and &quot;unexpected allies&quot;. It also adds news weapons and equipment, new enemies and bosses, plus the new Ritualist archetype.


It sounds like a good solid chunk of stuff for Remnant 2 fans to get stuck into, then, and Gunfire Games has now confirmed over on social media that players won&#x27;t need to own a copy of The Awakened King themselves in order to play through its storyline and visit its new location with a friend that&#x27;s already made a purchase.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been over three years since developer Jonathan Blow announced his critically acclaimed, time-manipulating platform-puzzler Braid was getting an Anniversary Edition, but, finally, a release is in sight; it&#x27;s coming to Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Netflix mobile on April 30th, 2024.


Given that Braid initially launched for Xbox 360 all the way back in August 2008, its Anniversary Edition will be arriving squarely within its 15th birthday year, and a significant amount of work has been done on the original release to celebrate that milestone.


For starters, Braid&#x27;s gorgeous visuals have been &quot;hand-repainted&quot; by original artist David Hellman. Today&#x27;s press release doesn&#x27;t elaborate on that much, but when the Anniversary Edition was announced in 2020, Blow said his Thekla Inc. studio was working on enhanced foregrounds and backgrounds, increased level of detail in certain areas, plus extra animations and effects to improve the feel of movement.

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Deck OLED, a revamped version of its popular handheld PC which boasts - as you might guess - a shiny new OLED screen as its star feature.


Steam Deck OLED retains the existing size and main technical specs of the current Steam Deck (so all current Steam Deck verified games will run the same on OLED models), but includes an improved display that&#x27;s bigger and uses HDR.


The new OLED models go on sale next week, on 16th November at 6pm UK time priced at $549 for a 512GB model or $649 for a 1TB model. (There&#x27;s also a lower $399 price right now for the 256GB current LCD model, which is sticking around as an entry-price alternative.)

Speaking to Eurogamer ahead of today&#x27;s Steam Deck OLED announcement, Valve engineers discussed the features it is adding to its shinier new handheld model that were not possible to provide back when the original Steam Deck debuted. 


The company also said it was working on game projects - plural - right now which were still targeting current Steam Deck hardware performance levels (which remain unchanged in the OLED).

                              <span>As we stroll gamely into month two of Sea of Thieves&#x27; extremely long-delayed Season 10, Rare has announced that the second of its three big tentpole features - the new PvP-focused Skull of the Siren Song voyage - will arrive next Thursday, 16th November.


The Skull of the Siren Song provides a more action-orientated addition to Rare&#x27;s piratical multiplayer adventure following the introduction of Guilds last month, essentially unfolding as an opt-in server-wide race to find the titular jewel-encrusted treasure.


Crews can opt-in to the new voyage whenever a ghostly note randomly appears on their ship&#x27;s mast during play. Once a sufficient number of teams are signed up, Captain Briggsy appears to hand them all two maps maps - one pointing to a chest containing the fabled skull, the other to the key required to open it - whereupon a messy dash to retrieve them both is likely to ensue. But there&#x27;s a little more mischief once the cursed skull has been found: any ship that houses it will significantly slow down, meaning it&#x27;s likely to change hands a number of times before one dedicated crew manages to cash it in at an outpost.

That&#x27;s according to a Korean forum for the forthcoming game, which claims producer Yoshinori Kitase mentioned in an interview a certain segment of the Rebirth trailer was actually taken from this CG sequence, which will be available to view at any time.


Final Fantasy streamer Aitai Kimochi shared the news on X, formerly Twitter, but noted the Korean forum doesn&#x27;t list an exact source for the interview.

                              <span>Strauss Zelnick, boss of GTA publisher Take-Two, has credited the company&#x27;s &quot;three-part strategy&quot; as the reason it has managed to avoid mass layoffs this year.


As we have reported numerous times over the past several months, the video game industry has seen layoffs after layoffs this year. This has resulted in studios being closed, such as Saints Row developer Volition. Others, such as Epic, have seen their numbers significantly reduced. 


According to Zelnick, Take-Two has managed to avoid such consequences thanks to moderate investments and a focus on efficiency over recent years.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto 6 could contain generative AI, according to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick.
Speaking at the Paley International Council Summit on 7th November, Zelnick highlighted AI&#x27;s potential in game development, specifically for NPCs (as reported by Inverse).
Interactions between players and NPCs are normally scripted, which Zelnick described as &quot;generally not very interesting&quot;. Using AI to generate dialogue trees and add variety could make the interactions &quot;really interesting and fun&quot;, he stated.

It will be available on BBC iPlayer and CBBC, though there&#x27;s no specific release date just yet.

                              <span>Broken Roads, the upcoming narrative-driven cRPG from developer Drop Bear Bytes, has been delayed.


The game was set to release in just a few days time, on 14th November. However, the developer has now announced it has delayed the game at the last minute to &quot;allow for additional polish time&quot;. More work is needed to make sure Broken Roads isn&#x27;t broken on release, essentially, with the help of more QA testing.


In a post on Steam, the Broken Roads team stated the game was &quot;content complete&quot; but &quot;coming in longer&quot; than originally expected. The developer said its roughly 30 hours of gameplay and vast dialogue had made it &quot;extremely time-consuming to properly test&quot; all of the game&#x27;s content.

That&#x27;s according to its latest financial earnings report, where hardware sales for the last quarter were 4.9m - a Q2 record for a PlayStation console. As previously reported in August, Sony had then sold 41.7m units.


Sony stated these sales were in-line with expectations and a 25 percent increase on PS4 units sold in the equivalent period (Q2 FY17). Further, the 4.9m PS5 consoles sold in Q2 is a 48 percent increase compared to last year, likely owing to increased stock.

In a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, Toufexis said both he and Jones &quot;worked for months&quot; providing dialogue for the main player character. 


But, as we all know to be the case, Bethesda ultimately decided Starfield&#x27;s protagonist should remain silent.

But in the years since, Star Wars: Hunters has been repeatedly delayed, with an original 2021 launch window turning into 2022, then 2023, and now - as of last night - 2024.


In a statement issued to X, formerly Twitter, last night, Zynga said it had made the &quot;difficult decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters to 2024&quot;, without providing any more concrete launch details.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 has now sold over 5m copies.


Sony announced the sales milestone today as part of its most recent financial results, prompting developer Insomniac to share the news more widely on X (formerly Twitter), alongside a rather pleased-looking Kraven the Hunter gif. 


&quot;Thank you to our incredible community for supporting us and helping us reach this milestone!&quot; the developer wrote, as Kraven &#x27;Whooped&#x27; below.

                              <span>Sony has halved the number of live service games it plans to release by March 2026 from 12 to six.


Back in February 2022, Sony stated it aimed to launch over 10 new live service games. The news came days after it acquired Destiny developer Bungie



Now, however, it seems plans are being scaled back to ensure each live service game&#x27;s quality, as Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki explained on a call discussing the company&#x27;s latest financial results (thanks VGC).

It&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve got an impression of how the game will look, with fantasy Lego characters such as a knight and a pirate with a peg-leg, and what looks like a dragon flying through the sky.


The artwork was spotted on the PlayStation Store and shared on social media by industry analyst MauroNL, who noted that the product&#x27;s page had since been deleted.

                              <span>Tired of having to explain yourself every time your friends catch you firing up Hosiery Party: Wet Potato Frenzy on Steam? Well, there&#x27;s some good news: Valve is reportedly readying a feature that&#x27;ll let you mark specific games as &quot;private&quot; so you can hide your more unusual tastes from other users while still maintaining a public profile.


At present, Steam&#x27;s privacy settings don&#x27;t support the kind of granularity needed to hide individual games, only enabling users to dictate broad categories - game details, friends list, inventory, screenshots, and workshop items - to keep discreet.


As spotted by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik, however (thanks PC Gamer), Valve is seemingly poised to add a &#x27;mark as private&#x27; setting to individual titles, so they can specifically be hidden from the prying eyes of friends. That means you won&#x27;t have to lock down huge chunks of your profile just to avoid difficult questions about the amount of time you&#x27;ve been playing Coquettish Elbow Reveal VR Edition. Or, in my case, 400 straight hours of Disney Dreamlight Valley.

                              <span>As part of its latest earnings call, Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav has outlined the company&#x27;s plans to transform its biggest gaming franchises from traditional console and PC releases into &quot;always on&quot; live service games.


Zaslav made the comments during his opening remarks to investors, in which referred to several of the company&#x27;s franchises - Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Batman, and Mortal Kombat - as $1bn gaming properties. Developer NetherRealm&#x27;s Mortal Kombat 1, he noted, has sold nearly 3m copies since launching in mid-September this year.


&quot;Our focus,&quot; he continued, &quot;is on transforming our biggest franchises from largely console and PC based with three-four year release schedules to include more always on gameplay through live services, multiplatform and free-to-play extensions, with the goal to have more players spending more time on more platforms.&quot;

                              <span>As reports of a Switch successor continue to build momentum, despite carefully phrased rebuffs from Nintendo, the Mario maker has said it&#x27;ll continue to release titles for its current console &quot;without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle.&quot;


Nintendo made the statement (thanks GameInformer) as part of its latest earnings report - in which it also confirmed Switch sales have now surpassed 132m units - writing, &quot;Switch will be entering its eighth year in March 2024. We will continue to release new titles and content for Nintendo Switch without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle.&quot; 


The inference (which isn&#x27;t the same as confirmation, of course) is that should a Switch successor launch next year, as is widely reported, Nintendo won&#x27;t be viewing it as end-of-life for its existing machine. That&#x27;s perhaps not much of a surprise given it&#x27;ll still have a substantial number of current Switch owners clamouring for new content with no plans to immediately upgrade, but it&#x27;s something of a departure from its traditional release strategy.

                              <span>Time Splitters studio Free Radical is reportedly the latest developer to be affected by Embracer Group&#x27;s sweeping restructuring programme, with the studio said to be facing closure.


Free Radical&#x27;s history is a long one and complicated one; the studio was founded in 1999 by a number of ex-Rare developers and quickly made a name for itself with the much-loved TimeSplitters FPS series. In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - which made this year&#x27;s Dead Island 2. However, in May 2021, Deep Silver announced it was reviving the Free Radical name and creating a new studio specifically to make more TimeSplitters, with original Free Radical co-founders Steve Ellis and David Doak at the helm.


Unfortunately, VGC now reports this new Free Radical is the latest studio to be impacted by parent company Embracer Group&#x27;s major restructuring programme, which was announced following the collapse of a massive $2bn deal in May and has resulted in extensive layoffs and closures throughout 2023.

Fans quickly speculated Chucky was on the way, and now we know they were right - he&#x27;ll be added in the next chapter on 28th November. Check out the trailer below.

The internet has leapt upon the announcement to suggest various names for Link, but who can you really see in the role - and can it not be Tom Holland, please? And definitely not Mark Wahlberg as an aged Link from the future. 
We also discuss the Zelda film&#x27;s potential story, and whether we think it will adapt any particular Zelda legend or simply follow the Mario movie&#x27;s example and go through the usual plot beats. Plus: the inevitable references Nintendo must include. And also... live-action Tingle? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

It looks like alert emails from Steam went out notifying fans of the game&#x27;s release, prompting some to download it and begin playing.
The mishap was fixed about 20 minutes later, after which the release date went through a rollercoaster of changes, including 31st December 1969, before ending up (correctly) on 17th November, 2023.

                              <span>Humble has announced the line-up of games for Humble Choice this month, which includes our 2021 game of the year Unpacking - and a bit of something for everyone.
Other titles we recommend checking out from Humble Choice&#x27;s November games are the retro-inspired sci-fi shooter Prodeus and spaceship salvaging simulator Hardspace Shipbreaker.
We crowned Unpacking our game of the year in 2021 for its human storytelling and satisfying puzzles of tidying things up. In her Unpacking review, Malindy Hetfield called the game a &quot;calm and tactile little sim&quot; which also allows players &quot;personal expression and finding fun in what&#x27;s literally just stuff&quot;.

As is now tradition, a showcase featuring many of these mods - some available now, some still in development - has been released to commemorate the franchise&#x27;s annual N7 Day celebrations. 


You can watch that all below, as - with thanks to the modders behind each project and those who have put together the showcase - Eurogamer is able to highlight some of the many promising projects fans have to look forward to.

December&#x27;s trailer will come 25 years after the founding of Rockstar in December 1998, and a little over a decade since the original launch of Grand Theft Auto 5.

                              <span>Still doubtless beaming from the runaway success of this year&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. movie, Shigeru Miyamoto has confirmed a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie is in the works.


Details are sparse at present, but Miyamoto, announcing the news on Nintendo Japan&#x27;s Twitter/X account, said the project has already been in development for &quot;many years now&quot;. As per an accompanying press release, Miyamoto will produce the movie - which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution) - with Avi Arad, responsible for &quot;many hit films&quot;, also producing.


Arad&#x27;s films, if you&#x27;re wondering, are primarily (but not exclusively) within the superhero genre, ranging from this year&#x27;s acclaimed Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and its celebrated 2018 predecessor, to 2022&#x27;s Tom-Holland-starring Uncharted adaptation, as well as the likes of Venom, Morbius, the live-action Ghost in the Shell, and next year&#x27;s Borderlands movie.

                              <span>Revenant Hill, the next game from Night in the Woods co-creators Bethany Hockenberry and Scott Benson and the first project from their new studio The Glory Society, has been cancelled amid &quot;serious health issues&quot; impacting several members of the team.


Revenant Hill was officially unveiled back in May, teasing an adventure, set in the year 1919, that would follow Twigs the cat&#x27;s attempts to make ends meet after an &quot;owl from the next hill&quot; began demanding she pay rent on her wet log near an abandoned graveyard.


There were hints of systems reminiscent of farming sims, with crops to be grown and a community to be built as the seasons passed, albeit with a cast of witches, demons, and ghosts, and more serious considerations on its mind. &quot;Times are hard,&quot; The Glory Society wrote at the time, &quot;Something big and dark is at work in the towns, the factories, in the forests and hills. At some point, someone is going to have to push back. And they can&#x27;t do it alone.&quot;

                              <span>Crunchyroll, the popular Sony-owned anime streaming service, is doing a Netflix and offering mobile games as part of its subscriptions starting today, 7th November.


Game Vault, as the new offering is officially known, is only available Crunchyroll members who subscribe to the streaming service&#x27;s Mega Fan or Ultimate Fan tiers. The former costs £5.99/$9.99 USD a month, while the latter is a US-only addition, priced at $14.99 USD.


Alongside their existing subscription benefits - which currently includes ad-free streaming of anime, simulcast shows, digital manga, and offline viewing - eligible members will gain access to a growing library of downloadable mobile games, albeit initially only available on Android (via the Google Play store), but with iOS support coming &quot;soon&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Red Hook Studios has announced a first paid DLC pack for its acclaimed horror sequel Darkest Dungeon 2. It&#x27;s called The Binding Blade and will introduce two new heroes - one who&#x27;ll be familiar to fans of the first game - when it arrives in December.


Darkest Dungeon 2 left early access back in May this year, taking players on a grim Lovecraftian road trip that Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a &quot;copious and often brilliant, if not quite unmissable reworking of a powerfully grim fantasy&quot; in his Recommended review.


It&#x27;s a solid foundation, then, and Red Hook will initially build on Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s oppressive, tactical turn-based core by introducing two new playable heroes (or, perhaps more accurately, anti-heroes), along with a few other bits, when The Binding Blade arrives.

It&#x27;s unclear, however, whether this means these are coming in Mass Effect 5 - still several years away - or sooner, as part of N7 Day itself.


&quot;We&#x27;ve asked ourselves many of the same questions you&#x27;ve asked us over the years!&quot; Mass Effect boss Mike Gamble wrote. &quot;What happened to everyone you know and love in the games? Who really died? Who had kids with whom? What does a baby volus sound like?

In a statement to Eurogamer, the company added more context to its reorganisation and confirmed it won&#x27;t affect production teams.
&quot;Over the past few months, every team within Ubisoft has been exploring ways to streamline our operations and enhance our collective efficiency so that we are better positioned for success in the long term,&quot; it said.

During an investor briefing held today following the company&#x27;s latest quarterly financial results, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa issued a blanket denial to address a swathe of reports that have mapped out the company&#x27;s progress towards launching its inevitable Switch successor. 

Nintendo showcased Switch 2 hardware capabilities to game developers in August around Gamescom in Cologne, Eurogamer reported at the time. Demos included a souped-up version of the original Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, meant to show off the Switch 2&#x27;s improved technical capabilities.

A number of free content additions are in development, but perhaps most intriguing is a new questline event - presumably to extend the core storyline.


The plan also includes ongoing weekly enhancements, including stability, performance, save game fixes, multiplayer improvements, balancing, increased boss difficulty, and other quality of life tweaks.

Fans have found that there&#x27;s a pettable dog (of course) featured during the game&#x27;s Trojan Horse mission, which you are encouraged to go stroke while attempting to blend into the level&#x27;s crowds. 


Linger on and continue looking at said dog after petting it and its name will soon pop up: Riley, the lovable German Shepherd who served as a squad member in Call of Duty Ghosts.

The chapter, based on the Netflix series, includes The Demogorgon as a Killer, Nancy and Steve as Survivors, and the Underground Complex Map.


The game&#x27;s developer Behaviour Interactive pulled this content from the game back in November 2021 due to an expiration of its licensing agreement with Netflix.

                              <span>Square Enix has reported a drop in profits, despite a boost from sales of its most recent Final Fantasy games. However, 2024 is likely to be a stronger year by comparison.


According to its latest financial report from April to September 2023, company operating income has dropped by 33 percent and ordinary income by 42 percent.


That&#x27;s despite an increase in sales for its HD Games, owing to the releases of Final Fantasy 16 and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 looks set to receive a new difficulty mode which will restrict players to one save file and permadeath.
A new achievement for the game called Foehammer, which references an Honour mode, has been spotted on the GOG launcher and shared on the game&#x27;s subreddit. Fans of developer Larian Studios have recognised Honour mode from its previous appearances in Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition and Divinity: Original Sin 2. 
In the Divinity games, Honour mode only allows players one save, regardless of whether it was a manual, auto, or quick save. Permadeath is enabled, and if the player&#x27;s entire party dies the save is erased. That&#x27;s all on top of the extra difficulty added by Tactician mode, the second most difficult option after Honour mode.

An update for Mirage launches today for PC, PlayStation and Xbox which adds a toggle for the visual effect. There had been numerous fan complaints that it was simply too distracting, and many requests for it to be switched off or toned down.


You can download the update (version 1.0.5) from 1pm UK time and try the option for yourself. Download sizes for the update range from around 3 to 5GB, depending on platform.

Following its conclusion, Embark announced that a whopping 7.5 million players joined the beta to battle it out among the masses.


&quot;It&#x27;s been a thrilling week for the entire team, one that we&#x27;ll never forget. We&#x27;re utterly dazzled by your kindness, openness, and excitement throughout the entire Open Beta period,&quot; it wrote in a blog post over on Steam.

The group has chosen today - 7th November - as it is BioWare&#x27;s N7 Day, an annual celebration of the developer&#x27;s Mass Effect franchise.


13 former testers were employed by Keywords Studios but seconded to BioWare to work on 2021&#x27;s brilliant Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy remaster. This group then worked on the upcoming Dragon Age Dreadwolf - before a dispute erupted over their continuing ability to work remotely.

That&#x27;s according to Epic Games Store boss Steve Allison, who was speaking during a court hearing on Monday. 


As reported by The Verge, the exec was talking during the current Epic vs Google court case. Here, Allison said while the Epic Games Store still isn&#x27;t profitable, the company&#x27;s focus remains on &quot;growth&quot;. Additionally, according to emails shared during the trial, Epic had hoped to claim half of all gaming revenue for PC games.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Switch console has now passed 132m units sold, but the company is remaining silent on its successor.


According to Nintendo&#x27;s latest report detailing sales over the last financial quarter, Switch sales are still going strong. Unit sales for the Switch family of consoles rose 2.4 percent year-on-year, with the OLED model the most popular. A further 4.69m Switch OLEDs were sold, as clearly players are willing to spend extra on the improved screen, or to simply upgrade from the older model.


On a conference call after the earnings release, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa refused to comment on plans for a Switch successor, despite rumours of a 2024 release.

                              <span>Sony is dropping Twitter integration from its PlayStation consoles starting next Monday, 13th November, mirroring similar decisions made by Xbox and Blizzard earlier this year.


Twitter (or X, if you must) integration has long been a part of PlayStation&#x27;s operating system, giving users a quick and convenient way to share screenshots, videos, Trophy achievements, and more to social media. Unfortunately, all that&#x27;s about to end.


&quot;As of November 13, 2023,&quot; Sony wrote on its support site, &quot;integration with X...will no longer function on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles. This includes the ability to view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).&quot;

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 studio Colossal Order has pledged not to release paid DLC for its city building sequel until its heavily criticised performance issues have been &quot;fixed to our standards&quot;.


Performance concerns have, of course, dogged Cities: Skylines 2 even before its release, with Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive taking the unprecedented step of warning potential buyers that it had &quot;not achieved the benchmark we targeted&quot; prior to launch - but then going ahead and releasing it anyway because &quot;releasing now is the best way forward.&quot;


In the weeks since, Colossal Order has continued to chip away at Cities: Skylines 2&#x27;s performance issues and bugs (even the ones definitely not related to teeth), and it&#x27;s now followed-up last week&#x27;s patch with a new blog detailing some of the changes to come.

The Nintendo exec has been named a &#x27;Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters&#x27; by the French Minister of Culture. As reported by NewsinFrance, a date for the presentation of this distinction has not yet been set. 


However, when the time does come for this presentation, Aonuma will join fellow Nintendo creator Shigeru Miyamoto as one of the few in the video game industry to be bestowed with the honour.

Chinese modder Last孤影众  (Gūyǐng zhòng) has created the Land of Reeds mod, which - among other changes - adds the rot boss to Sekiro, which YouTuber Ongbal tested out last month (thanks PC Gamer).


Yes, that means parrying every hit of Malenia&#x27;s Waterfowl Dance attack. That alone is quite the feat, though Ongbal&#x27;s Wolf is more than a match.

Pre-orders for the game have gone live from several retailers, though publisher Konami has yet to announce the release date for Silent Hill 2 Remake.
Amongst them, Best Buy has attracted attention for the following line in the product description: &quot;Fan-favourite character, Pyramid Head, makes a return along with a special origin story for fans to play through.&quot;

                              <span>Two months on from the release of Starfield, players are still waiting for Bethesda to address the numerous bugs which are present. But there&#x27;s a whole other group of players out there taking matters into their own hands - the team behind the Starfield Community Patch, an ambitious and surprisingly professional taskforce trying to fix the game themselves. The project came under the spotlight about a month before Starfield released. It was wild to think that a group of modders could already be working on a mod for Starfield before it had even released, but there they were - anticipating the Bethesda jank fans have come to expect. 


The SCP&#x27;s goal is to improve the vanilla experience of Starfield for players by fixing everything from major bugs to spelling errors, so long as it presents some sort of issue for players of the base game. The scope of the patch doesn&#x27;t include new content, balance changes (outside of correcting obvious errors), or anything which doesn&#x27;t fit with Bethesda&#x27;s original vision for the game.


I spoke to Timothy &quot;Halgari&quot; Baldridge, one of the founders of the SCP, to find out why the team came together to, in essence, do Bethesda&#x27;s work for them, and ask whether they&#x27;ve ever had any contact with Bethesda. I came away from our chat with a deeper appreciation for the project, which is more than just a simple effort to improve the experience of Starfield. It&#x27;s a collaborative effort between several modders and players to create a truly community-owned, open-source project, with standard practices of software development in place.

Narrative director Ben Arfmann and advanced writer Brittney Morris discussed how the ending of Spider-Man 2 will impact the likes of Peter, Miles and MJ, and spoke about a change of focus for Insomniac&#x27;s series.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 in the article below. If you are yet to finish the game, and wish to keep it as much a surprise as possible, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.

                              <span>Two Diablo 4 developers have dropped a big hint about a previously-denied secret cow level in the game fans have been searching for.


As previously reported, Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson stated there&#x27;s &quot;no secret level&quot;, but this hasn&#x27;t stopped fans from hunting for one. There was seemingly a breakthrough made last month, too, after a player acquired a mysterious relic that required killing exactly 666 cows.


Now, at this weekend&#x27;s BlizzCon 2023, production director Tiffany Wat and associate game director Joe Piepiora hinted the secret cow level might be real after all.

                              <span>Comparisons between the OG PS5 and the PS5 Slim are out, and some say the sleeker new design is &quot;not that much smaller&quot; than its chunkier sibling.

Dave2D has provided a detailed teardown of the brand-new console system, showing off the machine&#x27;s trimmer stature and the console&#x27;s new outer cover, which now boasts a half matte, half gloss finish. This means any panels bought for the original system cannot be used on the updated one, as it essentially has four separate pieces. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dave2D made specific mention of the weight difference. Whilst the original version weighs in at either 3.9kg or 3.3kg, depending upon whether or not you have the digital version or the system with the disc drive, the new models weighs 3.2kg or 2.6kg respectively.

                              <span>The Flipper Zero is an incredibly versatile hacking device. Now it can be used to crash iPhones in its vicinity by sending them a never-ending stream of pop-ups.
These types of hacks have been possible for decades, but they require special equipment and a fair amount of expertise. The capabilities generally required expensive SDRs­—short for software-defined radios­—that, unlike traditional hardware-defined radios, use firmware and processors to digitally re-create radio signal transmissions and receptions. The $200 Flipper Zero isn’t an SDR in its own right, but as a software-controlled radio, it can do many of the same things at an affordable price and with a form factor that’s much more convenient than the previous generations of SDRs...</span>

                              <span>Fortnite broke its own concurrent player record over the weekend, hitting an astonishing 6,172,463 users yesterday (Saturday, 4th November).

As tracked by Fortnite.gg, the return of Fortnite&#x27;s original map – dubbed Fortnite OG by developer Epic – has seen an influx of players, with the battle royale mode itself also breaking records when it hit a new high of 3,109,888 simultaneous players yesterday, too.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Epic has had to keep a close eye on server health and capacity, warning players that they may &quot;experience a short queue&quot; before logging in at peak times.

Players aged 16+ on PC and Android/iOS devices can apply now to be in with a chance of securing a spot in the beta, although miHoYo stresses that the test is only open to &quot;limited accounts&quot; and all data will be deleted at the end.  

Right now, it&#x27;s unclear when the beta test will run or even how long you have to get your name down on the list, but all interested parties are invited to complete the pre-registration and &quot;Equalising Test&quot; sign-up survey to &quot;successfully sign up for a chance to win Equalising Test Qualification&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard has revealed that it considers bringing World of Warcraft to consoles &quot;all the time&quot;.

In an interview with GamesRadar at BlizzCon 2023, vice president and executive producer for World of Warcraft Holly Longdale said that whilst the team was currently focussed on the &quot;three expansions&quot; for now, being part of Microsoft&#x27;s extended family means the team talks about making the game available on other platforms &quot;all the time&quot;.

World of Warcraft was released way back in 2004 – which means we&#x27;re just months away from the MMORPG&#x27;s twentieth anniversary – and has only been playable on PC for all that time.

That&#x27;s according to noted leaker eXtas1s, who says that &quot;if playtests proceed as planned&quot;, this date is &quot;what Larian has targeted for the game&#x27;s Xbox version at the moment&quot;.

As noted by r/GamingLeaksandRumours, eXtas1s has a pretty good track record for breaking release dates ahead of announcements, and had previously given us Forza Motorsport&#x27;s street date before Xbox formally confirmed it.

                              <span>Naughty Dog game director, Vinit Agarwal, has confirmed that they are &quot;still working on that game&quot;.

The news came in an unrelated message on Twitter in which Agarwal celebrated clearing all of the Special Worlds in Super Mario Bros. Wonder.

&quot;I did it! Wow, that was hard, easily 300+ Marios dead in the process,&quot; Agarwal said.

                              <span>Indie horror developer Puppet Combo has confirmed its festive slasher, Christmas Massacre, has been banned from release on Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

In an exchange on X/Twitter celebrating the upcoming release of the game on Sony consoles, a fan asked, &quot;Xbox?&quot;, to which the team responded: &quot;No, it&#x27;s too crazy for Xbox&quot;.

Similarly asked if the horror was coming to Switch, Puppet Combo had the same reply: &quot;No, it&#x27;s too crazy for Switch&quot;.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 players have hit out at NetherRealm&#x27;s &quot;disgusting&quot; decision not to bundle DLC skins in with DLC packs any more.

The fighting community is currently making its views very known on the series&#x27; subreddit community, generating thousands of upvotes. 

Although neither the developer nor publisher Warner Bros. have expressly said that alternate skins would not be available, players noted that at the end of the recent Omni-Man gameplay trailer, there was no mention of any additional skins bundled in with premium DLC characters.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 3 players with early access to Call of Duty&#x27;s latest instalment have taken to social media to share their dismay – and outrage – about the shooter&#x27;s campaign.
Although the first-person shooter doesn&#x27;t formally release until 10th November, some players who&#x27;ve forked out for the shooter&#x27;s pricier digital editions can play the campaign early via &quot;early access&quot;.

&quot;I played one hour of campaign and got my refund,&quot; announced one player. &quot;And I think you should too if you feel the same way I felt. This was a couple lacklustre raid episodes out together; having just finished COD Remastered recently this game failed to capture what it means to be in a campaign, and if this is how it all begins then I’m sorry, MW3 does not redeem itself from the shitshow MW2 caused at launch and somehow continues to make fun of my wallet. I’ll be holding off on touching this game until something positive comes back from this community. Peace.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft is officially winding down support for Far Cry 6.

In a post shared on Twitter/X, the publisher/developer thanked the &quot;millions of players&quot; who&#x27;d taken on Yara&#x27;s fight so far, adding that whilst there would be no &quot;interruption to online services&quot; of Far Cry 6, the team would &quot;no longer be making updates&quot; for the open world adventure.

&quot;Thanks to the millions of players who joined the fight!&quot; the message said. &quot;Your adventures can continue in Yara [without] interruption of online services, however, the dev team will no longer be making updates to Far Cry 6.

                              <span>BlizzCon is back - as an in-person event for the first time in four years - and Blizzard kicked off its opening ceremony with a bit of an Overwatch 2 blowout, including a reveal for the series&#x27; 39th hero, chaingun-wielding tank Mauga.


Mauga&#x27;s announcement wasn&#x27;t, admittedly, much of a surprise, giving he inadvertently got a pre-show unveiling on Switch&#x27;s eShop news channel, but he&#x27;s now been made official thanks to BlizzCon. And, as seen in his reveal trailer, Mauga - which means &quot;mountain&quot; in Samoan - is armed with two chainguns: affectionately known as Gunny and Cha-Cha.


Gunny is an incendiary chaingun, whose bullets will burn enemies that receive sufficient damage; Cha-Cha, meanwhile, is a a &quot;volatile&quot; chaingun that deals critical burn damage. Blizzard notes they can either be fired individually or in unison.

                              <span>BlizzCon has brought big news for World of Warcraft fans as the MMO prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary next year; Blizzard&#x27;s announced not only its next expansion, The War Within, but the two coming after that, all forming chapters in the newly revealed Worldsoul Saga.


The Worldsoul Saga was enthusiastically unveiled by Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen, who returned to the company late last year after departing in 2016. This new World of Warcraft story arc is set to play out across multiple expansions over the next few years, starting with The War Within - WoW&#x27;s tenth expansion - in 2024.


The War Within takes players into heart of Azeroth itself, where they&#x27;ll explore new subterranean kingdoms, engage with ancient cultures like the Earthen Dwarves - a new Allied race - and the terrifying Nerubians of Azj-Kahet. Azj-Kahet is one of several new zones coming in the expansion, alongside the Isle of Dorn, The Ringing Deeps, and Hallowfall.

                              <span>With this year&#x27;s BlizzCon now firmly underway, Blizzard has been whipping up the crowds with a bunch of announcements during its Opening Ceremony, including initial details on Diablo 4&#x27;s first expansion. It&#x27;s called Vessel of Hatred and it&#x27;s due &quot;late&quot; next year.


Vessel of Hatred - said to still be &quot;super early&quot; in development - continues the story of base game antagonist Prime Evil Mephisto, and introduces a new region to Diablo 4: the lush jungles of Torajan, last seen in Diablo 2.


Blizzard isn&#x27;t saying much more about Vessel of Hatred just yet but it does tease that it&#x27;ll feature &quot;new ways to play&quot;, &quot;new evils to vanquish&quot;, plus a new class never before see in the Diablo universe. There&#x27;s also a (not especially informative) teaser trailer to accompany the news.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever paused mid-slaughter during a game of Vampires Survivors and thought to yourself, &#x27;Yes, but what&#x27;s my motivation?&#x27;, you&#x27;ll want to ready yourself for the minimalist survival RPG&#x27;s next free update. As per studio Poncle&#x27;s latest development update, a new story driven, lore-infused Adventures mode will soon be on the way.


Poncle has teased Adventures before, describing them as a remix of content adding a bit of extra &quot;flavour&quot; through new stage progression and descriptions. Now though, via the medium of FAQ it&#x27;s gone into considerably more detail, explaining Adventures are essentially self-contained miniature story campaigns - some available as part of the base game, others tied to specific DLC - that&#x27;ll follow the game&#x27;s cast of Survivors on a series of &quot;wacky sidequests.&quot;


Adventures unlock at set points during the main game or their associated DLC, and feature a unique progression path that&#x27;ll see players starting from scratch (main game unlocks won&#x27;t be affected) using a specific character and item set-up as they attempt to complete a series of custom challenges with a limited arsenal. Those challenges might, for instance, require players to survive a certain amount of time or kill a set amount of enemies, and there&#x27;ll be bits of lore text forming a mini story arc along the way.

                              <span>Fresh footage as well as a playable prototype of a cancelled Daredevil game have appeared online.


Known as Daredevil: The Man Without Fear, this prototype was initially conceived all the way back in 2004, but the full game was never released. It has since come back into circulation, however, with the prototype being shared online by an anonymous developer who worked on it almost 20 years ago.


You can find this Daredevil prototype, along with several screenshots, over on Hidden Palace. According to the notes included with the prototype, The Man Without Fear was being developed for the PC, PS2 and Xbox, and was set to be a &quot;third-person beat &#x27;em up&quot; style game.

                              <span>Activision and Xbox have teamed up to release full screen ads for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on the console&#x27;s homepage, which players have since heavily criticised.


As shared by multiple users on social media, the ad in question pops up when players boot up their Xbox. &quot;Fight against the ultimate threat,&quot; the screen proclaims. 


It then suggests you perhaps buy the game ahead of its full release later this month (as a reminder, you can play the Campaign early if you pre-order). Your three options are simply &quot;Buy Now&quot;, &quot;Get the Vault Edition Upgrade&quot; and, mercifully, the option to &quot;Exit&quot; away from this ad and get on with what you actually booted up your Xbox for.

In a new interview with Automaton, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama and chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said Gaiden was made in half a year, with the former seemingly making a slight jest at Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya.

The game&#x27;s two DLCs - Night Springs and The Lake House - have also been teased by developer Remedy. Both of these are due to arrive sometime next year, and while the Alan Wake 2 team has alluded to what will be included, dataminers have managed to dig even deeper into the game and found more details about what&#x27;s next.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Alan Wake 2 and its relation to the Remedy Connected Universe below. If you are keen to keep the game as much of a surprise as possible, this is your cue to head elsewhere.

Warcraft Rumble is the company&#x27;s new free-to-play tower defence strategy title for mobile devices, featuring a cast of familiar faces from the World of Warcraft universe. 


Originally announced last year as Arclight Rumble, Blizzard&#x27;s latest effort arrived on app stores last night, a day ahead of this evening&#x27;s big BlizzCon opening ceremony.

                              <span>Lords of the Fallen has received a new patch with over a hundred changes, including buffing various bosses.


Players complained that some of the game&#x27;s bosses were too easy - this is a challenging Soulslike after all - but now the likes of the Sanctified Huntress, Griefbound, the Sundered One, and &quot;a boss at the bottom of a very dark place&quot; will be more formidable.


What&#x27;s more, the Scarlet Shadow has been made more difficult to cheese - that&#x27;s the reaper who chases players in Umbral. Now, he no longer takes fall damage and players can no longer hide and shoot him from above.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we share our warp pipe dreams for Mario Kart 9, as the final wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC gets its release date.
Nintendo has elongated the lifespan of its Wii U Mario Kart creation to last the entirety of the Switch era - and now we&#x27;ve reached the point where pretty much every track from the series worth playing has been crammed inside. So what&#x27;s next, if Nintendo can&#x27;t simply go bigger? Fresh ideas are needed, we feel. 
When will the Mario Kart series get a course creator? Is this the time - so that Nintendo can hand over some creative control to the community, and run the game as more of a live service platform? How about changes to the game&#x27;s characters, with special abilities to make different racers feel unique? And what about the idea of turning Mario Kart into more of a Nintendo Kart, with additional crossover franchises? Joining me to discuss are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is almost upon us (its campaign early access is upon us for those eager enough to have pre-ordered the game), and system requirements are pointing to an absolutely behemoth install size of more than 200GB in some cases come its full launch next Friday, 10th November - and Activision has now moved to explain what&#x27;s going on.


In a statement shared on social media, the publisher blamed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s potentially massive hard drive footprint on an &quot;increased amount of content available Day 1&quot;, which includes open world Zombies, support for items being carried forward from Modern Warfare 2, plus map files for the current the Call of Duty: Warzone.


The good news for anyone staring at their dwindling gigabytes like they&#x27;re modelling for Munch&#x27;s The Scream is that Modern Warfare 3 appears to offer a decent amount of control over exactly which bits are and are not installed. &quot;You can manage your Call of Duty files in the &#x27;manage files&#x27; section of the COD HQ launcher menu,&quot; Activision notes. &quot;This includes the ability to uninstall specific content you are not actively playing.&quot;

                              <span>After a week that&#x27;s seen significant layoffs at Bungie, as well as reports of a delay for Destiny 2&#x27;s The Final Shape expansion, the studio has told players &quot;we know we have lost a lot of your trust&quot; and promised to reveal plans to &quot;take us all out of this Darkness and into the Light.&quot;


Reports of widespread layoffs at Bungie began circulating on Monday, and were later confirmed in statement from studio CEO Pete Parsons. Bloomberg later reported around 100 employees - approximately eight percent of Bungie&#x27;s 1200-strong workforce - were affected by the job cuts, and that the layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a &quot;sharp drop&quot; in the popularity of Destiny 2.


Further reports have continued to paint a bleak picture of Destiny 2&#x27;s fortunes; pre-orders for The Final Shape are said to be disappointing, while &quot;good&quot; rather than &quot;great&quot; feedback has reportedly lead management to delay the expansion from February to June next year.

                              <span>Payday 3 hasn&#x27;t exactly had the smoothest of launches; matchmaking issues, online-only requirements, and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system immediately soured its arrival for players back in September, and a highly anticipated first patch promising &quot;200+&quot; quality of life improvements has been repeatedly delayed. Finally though, after much waiting, the heist-shooter&#x27;s 1.01 update is here on all platforms.


Payday 3&#x27;s 1.01 update was initially planned to launch on 5th October, but developer Starbreeze delayed its release to mid-October in order to &quot;ensure its stability&quot;. After weeks of silence, the developer re-emerged to announced another, this time indefinite delay, explaining it had &quot;identified some issues that need to be fixed&quot;.


As the wait has dragged on, Payday 3 player numbers have slumped to the low thousands, with the game&#x27;s predecessor currently pulling in ten times more than the new version. As such, Starbreeze will doubtless be hoping the long-awaited arrival of 1.01 today will help reverse the game&#x27;s fortunes. And it&#x27;s a big one too, weighing in at 2GB (on PC, at least) and spanning an enormous number of improvements and changes.

That&#x27;s according to HBO boss Casey Bloys (as reported by Variety), who shared the news during an HBO press event held in New York earlier today.


Bloys remarked that the recent WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meant production on the upcoming season had been delayed. This was first suggested as a possibility earlier this year and has since been confirmed by members of the show&#x27;s team.

                              <span>The Sims 4 team has lifted the lid on its upcoming expansion pack, known as For Rent. As you may have surmised given its title, this pack will allow players to give property ownership a whirl, and become a landlord. 


&quot;Revel in the hustle and bustle of Tomarang, discover unique items at the Night Market, and come home to a new Residential Rental lot where your neighbours are closer than ever,&quot; the pack&#x27;s official description reads. EA and Maxis describe this new location as a &quot;scenic world nestled in a lush tropical landscape and vibrant city skyline&quot;. It does look rather nice, I have to say.


Meanwhile, as you will be - in the Sims team&#x27;s words - closer than ever, this will mean bumping into neighbours left, right and centre. When you collect your post, they will be there. When you join in with a potluck meal event, they will be there. When you head out for a run, they will be there. In short, there will definitely be a lot more happening in your immediate vicinity when this pack goes live.

The figures come as part of a complete report into Sega Sammy&#x27;s 2023. Financial figures show from 2014 - 2023, with the past year having the highest figures of all for net sales, operating income, and ordinary income across the entire business.



Sega Sammy reports consolidated sales grew &quot;significantly&quot; by 21.4 percent, owing to growth in its Pachinko Business and Entertainment Contents Business (games and films).

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed a brand new character for Tekken 8. Meet &quot;living legend&quot; Victor Chevalier from France.


&quot;Descended from a lineage of distinguished knights, with a dream to rescue those in need, he followed the footsteps of his father and enlisted in the French Navy before joining the UN following his will to save more people,&quot; Victor&#x27;s official bio reads. &quot;As he felt the world was on the brink of being taken over by a corporate giant, he founded and trained the Raven Force - armed forces that have the authority to act at their own discretion to counter the corporation&#x27;s private armed forces.&quot;


You can see him in action, kitted up with a variety of optical weapons, a very sharp suit and insults such as &quot;bon appétit&quot;, via the video below.

                              <span>The CEO of Silent Hill: Ascension developer Genvid has  defended the game&#x27;s transactions, and said they were there to allow people to &quot;skip time&quot; in gaining in-game currency rather than being a way to &quot;game the system&quot;.


CEO Jacob Navok&#x27;s comments come after the game&#x27;s second night of new content, and amid backlash to its monetisation scheme. 

Navok posted last night on X, formerly Twitter, to respond to a wave of complaints about the game and attempt to explain Ascension&#x27;s economy, which consists of in-game currency earned by playing mini-puzzles and completing live-service style tasks, whilst also providing context on the removal of global live chat.

                              <span>After a surge of investment between 2020 and 2022, money funnelled into the video game industry from private equity sources has now dropped dramatically, back to and even below previous pre-Covid levels.


Data published by Konvoy as part of its Q3 2023 Gaming Industry Report show a sharp decline in investments following the second quarter of last year. 


As noted by EA Dice senior game designer Jan David Hassel, who shared these graphs on social media, investment in gaming surged to $14.78bn in 2021, and to 14.49bn in 2022. In 2023, this has now slumped to $2.09bn - around &quot;a seventh of the investment of each of the previous two years&quot;.

With this update in play, those making their way through the game&#x27;s many acts can expect to see many improvements across the board, but some particular highlights include the ability to now customise hirelings&#x27; appearance when recruiting them and the addition of a colour blind mode.

                              <span>Elden Ring was by far and away one of the most prolific games of last year. It won itself scores of praise and accolades following its release in February 2022, including topping Eurogamer&#x27;s own Game of the Year list.


This success has left many travellers to the Lands Between eager for more. Thankfully, current word is that Elden Ring&#x27;s previously announced DLC expansion is &quot;proceeding smoothly&quot;, despite developer FromSoftware not yet announcing any kind of time frame for its arrival on platforms.


This information comes from FromSoftware&#x27;s parent Kadokawa, via gaming consultant Dr. Serkan Toto. Sharing this update on X (formerly known as Twitter), Toto also added that Armored Core 6 has &quot;sold 700k units in Japan&quot; as of 30th September. However, while it appears Kadokawa is pleased with the game&#x27;s Japanese sales, it is not so happy about its sales elsewhere.

                              <span>Acclaimed Souls-like shooter sequel Remnant 2 is poised to receive its first expansion, The Awakened King, on 17th November, and developer Gunfire Games is celebrating today&#x27;s release date news with a DLC teaser trailer.


The Awakened King features a brand-new storyline focusing on the One True King, a being corrupted by the Root during his near-death slumber and now out for revenge. It&#x27;s up to players to uncover the king&#x27;s secrets by exploring a new area of Losomn - the announcement makes mention of a castle overlooking a Dran coastal town, but doesn&#x27;t explicitly confirm that this is where the DLC is set - containing new dungeons and &quot;unexpected allies&quot;.


There&#x27;s also talk of powerful new weapons and equipment for players to acquire - including new modifications, amulets, and rings - plus fearsome new enemies and bosses, risen from the depths of the ocean and now swarming the streets. And finally, there&#x27;s the new Ritualist archetype, which can leverage status effects to punish foes.

                              <span>Developer Rovio has said it is now blocking a &quot;disturbing&quot; pro-Israel ad featuring graphic content after a Reuters report highlighted its discovery in Angry Birds and a number of other family orientated games.


According to Reuters, the pro-Israel ad - created by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of an &quot;advocacy drive&quot; amid the continuing Israel-Hamas war - featured images of Hamas militants, rocket attacks, terrified Israeli families, explosions, and blurred graphic footage, culminating in the message, &quot;We will make sure that those who harm us pay a heavy price.&quot;


Speaking to Reuters, an Israeli government official confirmed the ads were part of a $1.5m USD campaign but insisted advertisers had been instructed to block the advert &quot;for people under 18&quot;. Despite these instructions, Reuters said it had documented six cases – in Britain, France, Austria, Germany, and Holland – where the adverts had been served in games for children or families.

                              <span>Bethesda has announced it&#x27;ll finally be introducing a number of much-requested graphics features to Starfield on PC next week - including its long-awaited Nvidia DLSS support - with all additions initially arriving as a Steam Beta update prior to general release.


PC players have aired their frustration with Starfield&#x27;s lack of DLSS support since before launch (its absence was initially believed to be the result of Bethesda&#x27;s partnership with AMD, although AMD insisted otherwise), and it wasn&#x27;t until September - one week after the game&#x27;s arrival - that Bethesda finally committed to adding it in a future update.


At the time, the developer also pledged to introduce 32:9 ultrawide monitor support, a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, plus brightness and contrast controls; some of those features have already been implemented in previous updates, and at least a few more of the remaining ones will make it into next week&#x27;s update alongside DLSS support.

                              <span>With Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s early access exit right around the corner, developer Gameloft has detailed some of the new features it&#x27;ll be getting as part of its full release on 5th December and beyond - including a first look at its free multiplayer mode and the recently announced A Rift in Time paid story expansion.


Starting with the free stuff, Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s next content update launches 5th December to coincide with its full release, bringing the &quot;biggest amount of fixes and improvements so far&quot;, alongside the addition of The Nightmare Before Christmas&#x27; Jack Skellington as a new villager with his own friendship quests and rewards.


More significantly, it&#x27;ll introduce the multiplayer ValleyVerse feature, enabling friends to visit each other&#x27;s villages - where, alongside the usual activities, they&#x27;ll be able exchange items, visit Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s store (to take advantage of different stock), and more. Gameloft says it&#x27;ll be building on this initial multiplayer offering over time.

                              <span>Mysterious zombie MMO The Day Before will now launch on 7th December, developer Fntastic has said, and be released on Steam as an early access game initially priced $39.


The Day Before had been slated to arrive next week, on 10th November, following a rollercoaster ride to release in which Fntastic was forced to deny the game was simply a scam, and fight off a bizarre trademark dispute over the game&#x27;s name - which was contested by a calendar app.


Now, a fresh statement by Fntastic released this evening states The Day Before will arrive later than planned (again) and under the banner of Early Access. &quot;This is our first huge game, and there may be unforeseen consequences,&quot; Fntastic wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

AccessNow puts this in context:
For India to uphold fundamental rights, authorities must initiate an immediate independent inquiry, implement a ban on the use of rights-abusing commercial spyware, and make a commitment to reform the country’s surveillance laws. These latest warnings build on repeated instances of cyber intrusion and spyware usage, and highlights the surveillance impunity in India that continues to flourish despite the public outcry triggered by the ...</span>

In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with Wojciech Tyczynski

Titled Deep Sleep, it&#x27;s set to be the scariest and longest chapter of the game so far, taking players further into the abandoned toy factory of Playtime Co..


Developer Mob Entertainment promises new characters, more minigames, and improved graphics in this instalment.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve already explored Grounded&#x27;s garden to the fullest (I haven&#x27;t, despite my best efforts, because it turns out I don&#x27;t entirely love man-sized spiders bearing down on me without warning), here&#x27;s a little something you might be interested in: developer Obisdian is releasing a free update on 13th November giving players the creative tools to build backyards of their own.


Make It or Break It, as the new update is known, introduces a new Playgrounds mode where players can either muck around with the backyard featured in the story campaign or create one from the ground up, using an empty sandbox as a starting point.


Make It or Break It&#x27;s suite of tools promises a considerable amount of creative freedom. Players can craft buildings and fill them with furniture, place obstacles, spawn creatures and bosses, even trigger ambient sounds and music. Obsidian says the majority of the campaign&#x27;s assets - including art props, gameplay items, and harvestables, right down to individual blades of grass - will available for use, with no limit on the number of objects that can be placed.

Described as an &quot;escape-town&quot; experience, it traps players in a sequence of escape room challenges that gradually expand in size and difficulty from a single room to much larger areas.


All the while players will need to run from the Sanguivore - &quot;freakish abominations with a hunger for your flesh and blood&quot;. Yikes.

                              <span>Silent Hill: Ascension aired its first episode yesterday, but players are lambasting the game for its monetisation options and overwhelming UI.
Despite my personal apprehensions about Ascension, I thought I would keep an open mind about it. This morning, when I read discussions within the Silent Hill community on the game, I couldn&#x27;t quite believe what fans were reporting until I tried the game for myself.
Despite developer Genvid claiming players can get involved for free, there&#x27;s a pay-to-win model (as much as an interactive livestream can be pay-to-win) implemented here. A £20/$20 Founder&#x27;s Pack will get you the season pass (which is also priced at £20/$20 as listed on the game&#x27;s Apple App Store page), unlock all puzzles in the game, and exclusive emotes with throwbacks to older Silent Hill references. And an exclusive emote which says &quot;It&#x27;s trauma!&quot; in rainbow colouring.

Each character has unique abilities as they explore 3D levels to take on Eggman, as always. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>The new voice of Wario - or at least, the person behind his grumpy moustachioed mouth in WarioWare: Move It! - looks to be Kevin Afghani, the actor also cast as the new voices of both Mario and Luigi.


It&#x27;s not a huge surprise to see Aghani taking on Wario as well, as this role was one of the four major Mario voices all performed by the legendary Charles Martinet, alongside Mario, Luigi and Waluigi. 


Afghani&#x27;s role as Wario looks to be confirmed within the WarioWare: Move It! credits, where he&#x27;s listed as the game&#x27;s principal performer. (In a typically oddball touch, we can also see his favourite food listed alongside his name: it&#x27;s sushi).

                              <span>Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has discussed the possibility of a fourth game in the series, and the idea of developing it as a more approachable prequel, similar to Yakuza 0.

Shenmue 3 was released in 2019, 18 years after the second game, but was aimed predominantly at fans of the series who backed the project on Kickstarter.


&quot;I want Shenmue 4 to be enjoyable for newcomers,&quot;  Suzuki said now, in an interview with IGN. &quot;To make that possible, the most important thing is to make it enjoyable without knowing previous events in the story. I don&#x27;t think that a new player wants to know 100 percent of the story. 20 or 30 percent could be enough.

Because of the shortened season length - believed to last only until the start of December - the game&#x27;s next battle pass will feature just 50 levels (half of the normal 100), leaks have revealed. 


The battle pass will be filled with character skins that are mash-ups of previous Fortnite favourites, such as Peely the banana man mixed up with ice cream mascot Lil&#x27; Whip - for a new skin named Lil&#x27; Split.

                              <span>Capcom says mods for its PC games can cause &quot;reputational damage&quot; thanks to content which causes offence to &quot;public order and morals&quot;, resulting in a blow to the games&#x27; (and presumably the company&#x27;s) images.

The statement was made during a recent presentation uploaded to Capcom&#x27;s research and development YouTube channel on anti-cheat and anti-piracy measures and how Capcom is tackling them in-house.

&quot;Mods are popular with users because they allow them to add or change various features to an existing game,&quot; Capcom said, admitting the &quot;majority of mods can have a positive impact&quot;. But some mods are seen as &quot;detrimental&quot; by the company in terms of &quot;reputational damage&quot; and workload.

However, Twitch is ending support for the app. From 6th November new users will no longer be able to download the app from the eShop. All users will then lose access from 31st January 2024.

                              <span>Now that Paradox has, after much secrecy, revealed Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture developer The Chinese Room as the new developer on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the information floodgates are open, and the studio&#x27;s latest development update has unveiled a new fully voiced playable protagonist, Phyre.


As per The Chinese Room&#x27;s latest developer stream, Phyre is a somewhat pre-defined Elder vampire recently awoken after a 100-year slumber and slightly bewildered by modern-day Seattle. Phyre, for reasons initially unknown, carries a mysterious brand on their hand which is somehow connected to a voice in their head - belonging to a modern vampire known as Fabien - who&#x27;s bound to them, serving as an ever-present companion as the adventure continues.


While Phyre&#x27;s loose backstory might already be in place, there&#x27;s some flexibility as to how they present in-game, with players able to choose their gender, clothing, and clan.

                              <span>Rollerdrome, the acclaimed (and ridiculously stylish) skater shooter from OlliOlli developer Roll7, is launching for Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on 28th November.


Rollerdrome, which debuted on PC and PlayStation toward the end of last year, is set in the far-flung future of seven years from now, where, in a world ruled by corporations, the public is kept placated by a brutal blood sport known, as, yes, Rollerdrome.


Thrust into this dystopian set-up, players, in the role of Kara Hasson, don rollerskates and raise weapons - specifically, dual pistols, a grenade launcher, shotgun, and eventually, a laser-crossbow - for some high-speed third-person shooting action, where performing tricks restores ammo and bullet-time-style slo-mo can be deployed for greater success against opponents.

                              <span>Yesterday&#x27;s layoffs at Destiny 2 developer Bungie reportedly impacted 100 employees - approximately 8% of its 1,200-strong workforce - and occurred just weeks after management warned staff that revenue for the year was running significantly below expectations.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which reports Bungie employees were issued &quot;dire management warnings&quot; that revenue was 45 percent below projections just two weeks ago. The slump is said to be the result of a &quot;sharp drop&quot; in the popularity of Destiny 2, with Bungie CEO Pete Parsons having reportedly highlighted weak player retention at the time.


In that same meeting, according to Bloomberg sources in attendance, Parsons told employees that Destiny 2&#x27;s next expansion, The Final Shape - which concludes the game&#x27;s current Light and Darkness saga - was only getting &quot;good&quot; rather than &quot;great&quot; feedback. As such, management was planning to delay its release to improve the product.

                              <span>Atari has entered into an agreement to acquire Digital Eclipse, the retro-focused studio behind the likes of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration and this year&#x27;s The Making of Karateka.


Digital Eclipse has existed in a number of forms since its founding in 1992. In its original guise, it specialised in porting arcade games over to the likes of Game Boy Colour and PlayStation; that emulation work has continued in the years since despite organisational changes, first as it become Backbone Entertainment following a merger in 2003, and again after the Digital Eclipse brand was purchased and revived by former employees in 2015.


In more recent times, the studio&#x27;s emulation work has included the Blizzard Arcade Collection, Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, but last year&#x27;s interactive digital documentary Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - which blended new video interviews, archival material, and playable games to form an exhaustive record of Atari&#x27;s history - was particularly well-recieved. The studio then launched its Gold Master Series earlier this year, taking a similarly thorough approach to individual classic games, starting with the acclaimed The Making of Karateka.

                              <span>Can you believe it, but yesterday marked 25 years since Grim Fandango first made its way into the world. Nope, nor can I!


To mark the ever marching hands of time, and I suppose the occasion, the team at Double Fine has shared some special fan creations including cosplays and artwork. 


&quot;Our team got together with our community and made this amazing tribute filled with stories, art, and tattoos!&quot; Grim Fandango&#x27;s director Tim Schafer shared on X (formerly Twitter). &quot;Thank you to everyone who contributed and collected these beautiful memories! I&#x27;ll keep them next to where my heart used to be.&quot;

                              <span>Forthcoming team shooter The Finals has been criticised for using AI for its commentator voiceovers.


Developed by Embark Studios, comprising former DICE employees, it&#x27;s currently in open beta - as announced at the recent Xbox Partner Preview showcase.



As part of its arena battle style, it includes voiceover from two commentators, but these have been developed with AI drawing criticism from voice actors and designers alike.

Speaking with Comic Book about his upcoming comic Scrapper, conversation turned to the shooter series. Bleszinski said he could consult  on any ideas Microsoft may have for the series, and suggested it could get a &quot;little bit of a reboot, like God of War&quot; had in 2018. 


&quot;I&#x27;ve always said, Phil Spencer has my number,&quot; he told the publication. &quot;I&#x27;m happy to consult. Gears will always be near and dear to my heart.&quot;

The investment was announced as the university celebrates being the first institution in the UK to offer an esports degree programme. The programme has recently been redesigned &quot;in collaboration with students and industry&quot;, the university stated.  
The money will go towards creating a bespoke esports arena on the university&#x27;s Stoke-on-Trent campus, a studio with &quot;dedicated broadcast galleries&quot;, and equipment from Panasonic and EVS. Esports students will also have access to &quot;esports aethetics and theming&quot;. The facilities are expected to be finished by spring 2024.

NES games Devil World and The Mysterious Murusame Castle are now available to play, while Castlevania Legends has been added to the selection of Game Boy titles.
Devil World is a maze game similar to Pac-Man but with a religious twist. You play as a green dragon who decides to take on the devil and must collect crucifixes and Bibles to gain the ability to breathe fire, eventually chasing the devil through a number of different mazes. The re-release of Devil World on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console was alright by our book.

                              <span>Kratos and Nathan Drake will soon be able to flex their enormous strength on an all new PC store, as God of War and the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection are both coming to GOG.


&quot;These upcoming arrivals mark a pivotal moment on GOG, as we know how many souls wanted to visit those incredible realms on our platform,&quot; the team over at GOG proclaimed while sharing this news. 


We still don&#x27;t have an exact release date for the former PlayStation exclusives&#x27; arrival on the store, but the team has assured us it will be &quot;soon&quot;. You can, however, wishlist both God of War and Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves now. When they do arrive, they will be joining other Sony titles Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn on this additional PC storefront.

                              <span>Ubisoft is &quot;decommissioning&quot; online services for a further 10 of its &quot;older&quot; titles, with the likes of Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2, Splinter Cell: Conviction, and Trials Evolution all affected.


&quot;Decommissioning the online services for older games is something we do not take lightly,&quot; the publisher wrote in a post on its support site. &quot;however, it is also a necessity as the technology behind these services becomes outdated.&quot;


In total, 10 games will see their online services yanked as of 25th January next year. On PC, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Revelations, Ghost Recon Future Solider, Heroes of Might and Magic 4, NCSI, RUSE, and Trials Evolution will all be affected. Online services will also be decommissioned for Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2 and Spinter Cell: Conviction on Xbox 360, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Liberation HD (Xbox 360 and PS3), plus Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood (Mac).

                              <span>Bungie has reportedly told staff it will be delaying next year&#x27;s planned Destiny 2 expansion The Final Shape, as well as the studio&#x27;s upcoming Marathon reimagining.


According to a report by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, citing &quot;people with knowledge of the matter&quot;, Destiny 2&#x27;s The Final Shape expansion - which is set to conclude the game&#x27;s Light and Darkness saga - will now launch in June next year. Bungie publicly announced a 27th February 2024 launch for the expansion back in August.


As for Marathon - a PvP reimagining of Bungie&#x27;s classic 90s FPS series, which was revealed in May - that has yet to be given an official release date. However, Bloomberg says this has now been moved into 2025, suggesting the studio was previously targeting a launch next year.

                              <span>Little Nightmares 3 might still be some way off - it&#x27;s due to arrive in 2024 - but, in the spirit of this spookiest of seasons, Bandai Namco has shared 18 minutes of co-op gameplay.


Announced back in August, Little Nightmares 3 marks the first time a mainline entry in the series won&#x27;t be handled by original developer Tarsier Studios. Instead, Supermassive Games - the team behind The Dark Pictures Anthology and Until Dawn - is at the helm, taking players on an adventure following two new protagonists.


Our spooky new pals are Low and Alone, both trapped in a world known as the Spiral - a &quot;cluster of disturbing places&quot; that includes the sandy Necropolis, home to a monolithic (and far from friendly) creature known as Monster Baby. An extensive look at the Necropolis and its perils can be found in the new gameplay trailer below.

                              <span>The Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s movie adaptation from Universal and Blumhouse has seen some impressive numbers following its release, breaking several records in the process.


The live-action adaptation of Scott Cawthon&#x27;s video game series, which stars The Hunger Games&#x27; Josh Hutcherson as troubled security Mike Schmidt, made its box office debut last week and has earned $78m in North America and $130m globally since then. 


As noted by Variety, this makes the movie the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US, coming only behind that of Nintendo and Illumination&#x27;s animated Super Mario Bros. Movie, which made $146.3 million.

                              <span>Square Enix has announced Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, the next game in the Disney-meets-Final-Fantasy series, for Android and iOS, and sign-ups for the closed beta are now open. 
Square describes the game as a &quot;GPS action RPG&quot; featuring new characters and a new story within the Kingdom Hearts universe.
The developer hasn&#x27;t revealed much else about the game, though from the trailer gameplay looks to be split between open-world exploration and battles against Heartless enemies.

                              <span>A design filed by Nintendo has been found and shared online that shows a dual-screen gaming device that can be split in two. 


This filing was made in November of last year, but was made public earlier this month. As shared on World Intellectual Property Organisation (via ResetEra), images of this device show a handheld apparatus, not too dissimilar to that of a Nintendo 3DS. Unlike the 3DS, however, this device can be split in half to allow for wireless gaming between two players.


It appears to be a handheld machine only, with no hybrid capabilities. Additionally, the top screen can face out. This is even when the device is closed. I can only assume if this product was to ever be realised, Nintendo would advise we all get some kind of case to go with it to protect the screens

In an interview with PC Gamer, the Counter-Strike 2 dev team – seemingly responding as a team and not as individual developers – said that whilst it had worked hard to ensure CS:GO players could transfer their skins and cosmetics into CS2, it &quot;didn&#x27;t know enough&quot; about NFTs to contribute meaningfully to the web3 debate and claims that players could transfer their NFT cosmetics in the same way.

&quot;From the start of development, we knew that CS2 would ultimately replace CS:GO, and we wanted to ensure that players could keep as many of their CS:GO skills and items as possible,&quot; the CS2 dev team said. &quot;So, early into the process, we started the work to support all of the CS:GO weapons, stickers, agents, and music in CS2.

In an interview with GQ magazine, Lake admitted that whilst the development of cult horror game Alan Wake was difficult in the shadows of Max Payne – &quot;the curse of the second album&quot;, as Lake describes it – there are still other worlds outside of Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Control he would like to entertain us with. 

&quot;Would I ever do anything else?&quot; he asks. &quot;Yeah. I&#x27;m still thinking that I will. There will be a time when I retire. It&#x27;s just that… this has all been so engaging.&quot;

                              <span>Magic: The Gathering&#x27;s head designer, Mark Rosewater, has responded to criticism from fans who think he&#x27;s gone back on his word that MTG would be &quot;one cohesive game&quot; and refrain from introducing crossover promotions to the fan-favourite collectable card game.

The comments come after Wizards of the Coast recently revealed what new crossover expansions Magic: The Gathering fans can expect to see next year, including new sets based upon Final Fantasy, Fallout, and the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series.

Back in 2018, Rosewater was asked if WotC would ever &quot;consider licensing a different IP and creating different cards for it&quot;. In response, he said that the team thought it was &quot;important that Magic is one cohesive game and not a hodge podge of different things&quot;.

                              <span>The islands of Åland are an important tax hack:
Although Åland is part of the Republic of Finland, it has its own autonomous parliament. In areas where Åland has its own legislation, the group of islands essentially operates as an independent nation.

This allows Scandinavians to avoid the notoriously high alcohol taxes:
Åland is a member of the EU and its currency is the euro, but Åland’s relationship with the EU is regulated by way of a special protocol. In order to maintain the important sale of duty-free goods on ferries operating between Finland and Sweden, Åland is not part of the EU’s VAT area...</span>

                              <span>Dead Space 3 writer and co-producer Chuck Beaver says he would &quot;redo Dead Space 3 almost completely&quot; if given the chance. 

That&#x27;s according to an interview Beaver gave with the CaptainBribo podcast, in which he said that while he would &quot;keep the lore beat it&#x27;s predicated on&quot;, and &quot;keep the lore you find out&quot;, he would &quot;have Ellie there but in a different relationship [with Isaac] and redo the entire main story&quot;.

As transcribed by PCGN, Beaver talks with Bribo about how, if able to rewrite the third instalment of the terrifying sci-fi horror series, he would ensure the story focussed more tightly on protagonist Isaac Clarke, albeit retaining the co-op mechanic to illustrate how the two characters see the same things differently.

That&#x27;s according to u/Tobbelobben30, who and noted that the name Tobias Kleanthous was &quot;mentioned in the [GTA 6] leaks&quot;. After a little sleuthing, Tobbelobben discovered that Kleanthous worked at Rockstar between 2014 and late 2021, during which he specialised in AI/gameplay and animation. 

Interestingly, Kleanthous is also the lead inventor and author of a patent called System and Method for Virtual Character Locomotion, which they describe on their LinkedIn profile as &quot;regarding animated locomotion control based on some of the core technology&quot; they &quot;architected and implemented at Rockstar Games&quot;.

In the succinct post shared on Twitter/X – Yamauchi didn&#x27;t add anything else, I&#x27;m afraid – the producer also appended the now customary screenshot that shows off a selection of super-charged cars obscured in shadow. 

People more familiar with cars than I am are speculating that the seven cars coming in this &quot;big update&quot; are:
