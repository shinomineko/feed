                              <span>Lara Croft is coming to Magic: The Gathering as part of an upcoming Secret Lair x Tomb Raider collaboration. 


This collaboration will see six cards and a new treasure token making their way to the trading card game. Five of these cards are familiar Magic cards which have been re-imagined with artwork from the Tomb Raider games.


The cards themselves feature scenes from across the series, with the likes of Rise of the Tomb Raider&#x27;s Kitezh and the original/Anniversary game&#x27;s Lost Valley making a showing. There is also an equipment card for Totec&#x27;s Spear (from Guardian of Light), while Lara&#x27;s bow features as The Grim Whisperer.

Last night, The Game Awards revealed its nominees for the upcoming event, which is set to take place on Thursday 7th December. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 received multiple nominations this year, including Game of the Year, Best Game Direction and Best Narrative.


 Sharing its delight, Larian said it was &quot;extremely proud&quot; to see its game nominated across the various categories. It then closed with a little tease: &quot;Xbox fans, and fans of physical media, watch this space for a formal announcement. It&#x27;s going to be a busy week.&quot;

Official mod support and mod tools will be added to the game as an all-in-one Editor, which publisher Paradox previously confirmed wouldn&#x27;t be present at launch. 
In the latest developer diary from Colossal Order, CEO Mariina Hallikainen said the studio expected to need at least a couple more months to get the Editor &quot;in a shape where we can release it&quot;.

&quot;We&#x27;ve listened to our customers and we know delivering free games every month is what they want most, so we are refining our Prime benefit to increase our focus there,&quot; wrote Christoph Hartmann, VP of Amazon Games in an internal email shared with Aftermath.

                              <span>Remedy plans to reboot its free-to-play co-op multiplayer game, codenamed Vanguard, as a premium release.


The game will be published by Tencent, but &quot;due to uncertainties in creating a successful game to the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks&quot;, both companies have &quot;discussed a new direction&quot; for the project.


It&#x27;s got a new codename too: Kestrel.

                              <span>Xbox has announced a competition in collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures to promote the upcoming film Wonka which will see one lucky person win a range of chocolate goodies including a Wonka-inspired Xbox Series X and an edible controller.
The winner will also receive a regular black Xbox wireless controller, as the chocolate controller presumably can&#x27;t be used with the console. 
This is the first-ever &quot;official edible&quot; Xbox controller, the company notes, which begs the question - who is making unofficial edible Xbox controllers and out of what? Chocolate would be my last choice. Surely it&#x27;ll melt really quickly in your hands?

The disc drive was shown in action by YouTuber Mystic in a PS5 slim unboxing video, in which he walked through the process of pairing the drive with a console. 
The disc drive will easily pair to a console, even if it&#x27;s already registered to a different one and the console has its own disc drive registered.

The speedrunner, Weedmoder, currently holds the world record time of 50 minutes and 30 seconds and shared a video of the run online (thanks VG247).



Of course, the speedrun involves banging the bear, aka druid Halsin. That means completing his romance questline, which cannot be done until Act 3.

Titled Content Streaming With Gameplay Launch, the patent was filed on 11th July 2023 and publically published on 2nd November via WIPO (spotted by Exputer).

It describes a game which contains multiple &quot;trigger points of media content&quot;. These are moments which the player could start a replay from, which would be provided &quot;by the platform, publisher, or third-party publisher&quot;. These trigger points are described as the start of an &quot;activity&quot; such as a boss battle or quest, or when a player levels up.

Reina is the 32nd and final fighter to join the upcoming release&#x27;s roster, but, as is always the case, last is certainly not the least. Her character promises lightning fast moves, and a mysterious interest in Jin. Why does she want to fight him so badly? We will have to wait to find out.

                              <span>The newly-launched Modern Warfare 3 still lacks a number of multiplayer maps this week, after developer Activision was forced to pull them from rotation soon after the game launched. 


Quarry, Rundown and Scrapyard were removed from the game&#x27;s Hardpoint playlists last Thursday, 9th November, after players complained. In a post on its bug-tracking social media account, Activision acknowledged &quot;an issue causing unfavourable spawns&quot;. 


Karachi was next to go last Friday, 10th November - binned from Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s Cutthroat playlist while Activision, it said, worked to &quot;resolve an issue causing a player to spawn alongside enemies&quot;.

Not to be confused with Let Me Solo Her, who assisted players with the iconic Malenia battle, Let Me Solo Them wears a similar jar helm attire but their focus is the game&#x27;s pair of final bosses - hence the name.


&quot;It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I&#x27;m sincerely grateful,&quot; said the player on reddit. &quot;This marks the end of a chapter but I just wanted to say, thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the players that summoned me.&quot;

                              <span>PlayStation 5 accounted for 51 percent of all console sales in the UK over the past six months.


Sony&#x27;s latest console held a 43 percent share on all console sales between November 2022 and October 2023, according to UK chart firm GfK (via Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz).  But hone in on the last six months and the PS5&#x27;s sales account for just over 50 percent of all console purchases since May.


GfK games boss Dorian Bloch said these figures are a result of various price promotions held over the summer months, the console&#x27;s recent EA Sports FC bundle and, of course, &quot;unrestricted sales&quot; on the standard PlayStation 5 model. Unlike previous years, there are currently no supply and stock shortages for Sony&#x27;s PS5 console here in the UK.

The game will feature fully-customisable touch controls designed specifically for this version, though a Bluetooth controller will be compatible too.

                              <span>UK boxed sales for Modern Warfare 3 fell 25 percent short on last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 launch.


That&#x27;s according to UK sales figures shared by numbers company GFK (via GamesIndustry.biz). 80 percent of boxed sales were on PlayStation, with 20 percent on Xbox.


The new Modern Warfare 3 marks the first time Activision Blizzard has double dipped on the same Call of Duty sub-brand two years running to immediately release a direct sequel to the previous year&#x27;s game. But controversy has swirled around the game&#x27;s development and release.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players have discovered a strange bug that essentially traps players against an invisible wall, stopping them from moving and leaving them exposed to competitors.

The issue – which has been around for some time now – chiefly affects players on the Colosseo map, and sees players get trapped. Without the help of characters like Lifeweaver of Mei&#x27;s movement abilities to bump them out of position, they&#x27;ll stay trapped, too.

Despite many players reporting they&#x27;ve also been stuck in this exact spot as a myriad of different players, it doesn&#x27;t look like Blizzard&#x27;s yet been able to address the problem.

It&#x27;s left fans wondering how NetherRealm will implement Homelander, and who will be the voice behind the character when he joins as a guest fighter next year.

&quot;My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined,&quot; lamented one unhappy fan in a comment that has been upvoted hundreds of times.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence will change so many aspects of society, largely in ways that we cannot conceive of yet. Democracy, and the systems of governance that surround it, will be no exception. In this short essay, I want to move beyond the “AI-generated disinformation” trope and speculate on some of the ways AI will change how democracy functions—in both large and small ways.

There&#x27;s been no formal confirmation from either Sony or then-publisher THQ that the family favourite adventure game was coming to current-gen Sony systems.

The statement comes days after Bloomberg broke the news that employees needed to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period.

&quot;We’re incredibly proud of Modern Warfare 3 – both the full game experience at launch and the upcoming year of content we have planned for the community,&quot; said Sledgehammer&#x27;s studio head, Aaron Halon.

As spotted by Naruki on X/Twitter, players who&#x27;ve already pre-ordered the remake from the eShop have discovered that ArtePiazza - perhaps best known for its work on Square Enix&#x27;s Dragon Quest series - has taken the reigns, with Nintendo&#x27;s Ayako Moriwaki stepping into the director role.

That said, some of the inaugural developers who worked on the 1996 original have also been credited in the game, including co-director Yoshihiko Maekawa, composer Yoko Shimomura, and designer Taro Kudo.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has announced it is expanding its retail presence across the UK with an additional London store and &quot;more stores nationally&quot;.

From 14th November, there&#x27;ll be a new &quot;collection&quot; of Bandai Namco Cross Store at London&#x27;s Victoria Place which will &quot;celebrate the physical nature of entertainment and Bandai Namco&#x27;s rich brands&quot;, including Gashapon, Ichibankuji, and Sun-Star Stationery merchandise. 

&quot;As the popularity of Japanese culture, collectables, digital and physical experience continue to rise in the UK, these new stores offer a slice of those experiences adored throughout Japan by the Bandai Namco Group supporting a passionate community,&quot; the company said, but stopped short of clarifying what other locations fans will be able to find the newly-minted stores in the future.

Ten years ago now, Forbes – as spotted by The Digital Fix – shared a concept trailer for a CG Legend of Zelda movie. Created by Netflix&#x27;s The Sea Beast&#x27;s Adam Holmes, it shows Link sweeping in to save Princess Zelda from a gaggle of evil Bokoblins.

The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, as the film is officially titled, begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. However, as answers are slowly revealed, Geralt finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.


&quot;He must count on friends — old and new,&quot; Netflix teases in its announcement, &quot;to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting Nightdive Studios&#x27; Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion remaster, you&#x27;ll need to hang in there just a bit longer; the developer is delaying its release by a few weeks, with the dino FPS now coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 30th November.


Nightdive&#x27;s remastering of the original Turok trilogy - which was developed by the now-defunct Iguana Entertainment - has been quite the undertaking; the studio released its Turok 1 remaster eight years ago, back in 2015, and its sequel got the spruce-up treatment two years later. 


Nightdive&#x27;s Turok 3 remaster - which will mark the first time the game has been available since its N64 debut in 2000 - promises to be similarly thorough, introducing enhanced environment art and character models, updated weapon models, plus &quot;advanced rendering features&quot; that&#x27;ll include anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has attempted to placate angry Mortal Kombat 1 players with two &#x27;free&#x27; Fatalities following an outcry caused by the decision to introduce a $10 USD Fatality animation to the game&#x27;s already heavily criticised premium store.


Despite being sold as a full-price title costing £59.99/$69.99 USD, the latest entry in developer NetherRealm&#x27;s long-running fighting series features a rotational in-game shop selling store-exclusive cosmetics - including costumes and gear - only available to purchase with real-world money (in contrast, Mortal Kombat 11 also enabled players to buy cosmetics, but these could largely also be earned by completing activities in-game).


While Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s premium store has already drawn plenty of ire from players, things came to a head last month when Warner Bros. and developer NetherRealm began selling a store-exclusive Halloween Fatality animation for $10. To put that in some kind of perspective, $20 would get you several DLC characters in Mortal Kombat 11.

                              <span>Whatever you might think of Call of Duty, you can&#x27;t accuse its anti-cheat team of lacking imagination; having previously caused chaos for multiplayer cheaters by whisking away their weapons and turning opponents invisible, it&#x27;ll soon be cutting their parachute cords and causing their bunny hops to launch them 10,000ft into the air before a very messy end.


This latest bit of mischief is the work of the team behind Call of Duty&#x27;s server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, officially known as Ricochet, which outlined its latest steps in the war against online ne&#x27;er-do-wells - particularly the role Machine Learning plays in improving its anti-cheat systems - in a timely blog post coinciding with today&#x27;s launch of Modern Warfare 3.


&quot;Combining everything [we have] developed over the course of the last two years with new Machine Learning advancements,&quot; it wrote, &quot;Richochet: Anti-Cheat is preparing for the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 with a stronger and faster process to combat cheating.&quot;

                              <span>Mass Effect fans have been debating a recent claim that the next game in the series may not launch until 2029.


This week, Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb suggested Mass Effect 5 would not arrive until near the end of the decade, based on insider knowledge and some back of the envelope maths based on the ongoing and protracted development of Dragon Age Dreadwolf.


Grubb&#x27;s comments were predictably pounced upon by fans following a somewhat mixed response to this year&#x27;s annual Mass Effect franchise celebrations on 7th November - N7 Day.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto has admitted Nintendo faces &quot;an extremely high hurdle&quot; not to disappoint fans across the world with the forthcoming film.


Following the company&#x27;s latest earnings report, Miyamoto and CEO Shuntaro Furukawa were asked about the risks of expanding IPs beyond video games, to which Miyamoto responded directly on the Zelda live-action film that was announced during the report.



&quot;Regarding the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, I know we face an extremely high hurdle in producing a film that will not disappoint the global fan base,&quot; he said. &quot;With this challenge in mind, I have been discussing this project with Avi Arad, Chairman of Arad Productions Inc., for about 10 years.&quot;

Hype Chat was a feature launched in June that allowed viewers to pay to have messages pinned at the top of a streamer&#x27;s chat window.



Now, just five months later, it&#x27;s being deprecated from 15th November and instead Twitch will invest more into Cheering and Bits.

                              <span>Activision has claimed its Call of Duty HQ launcher provides easier file management and seamless switching between games, despite criticism from players.


Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, the latest in the series, now launches from Call of Duty HQ alongside last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2. Activision describes the launcher as &quot;the front door for Call of Duty&quot; and states &quot;players have control over the footprint of their Call of Duty experience on their platform of choice, and it&#x27;s all contained within one unified location&quot;.


In practice, however, it&#x27;s confusing plenty of players and has resulted in huge file sizes - as previously reported, the install size of the complete package is over 200GB on some platforms.

                              <span>The Xbox port of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 appears to be progressing well as fans still await a firm release date.
Larian&#x27;s own Swen Vincke recently shared a rather welcome update with his followers over on X (formerly Twitter). In a new post, the CEO shared two graphs showing how RAM and VRAM loads for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Series S port have been reduced in recent weeks. 

&quot;Got a nice present from our engineers. Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back. I think this will benefit all platforms too,&quot; he wrote to accompany the two graphs (which you can see via the embed below).

Back at BlizzCon last week, The War Within expansion was revealed along with two further expansions to begin the multi-part Worldsoul Saga. However, the Epic edition (costing $89.99) includes guaranteed beta access and three days of early access, the first time Warcraft has offered this.


Fans have responded angrily, as per this reddit thread, but Hazzikostas said the studio is following a trend.

                              <span>A new report claims Modern Warfare 3 was developed in just 16 months. That&#x27;s roughly half the time of a standard Call of Duty release. 


More than a dozen employees at developer Sledgehammer shared their experiences working on the Modern Warfare 2 sequel with Bloomberg - in particular the need to crunch by working late nights and weekends ahead of release due to its truncated development period. 


Meanwhile, sources said that Modern Warfare 3 initially started out as an expansion to last year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 - something that was previously suggested. This expansion, which was codenamed Jupiter, was reportedly going to be set solely in Mexico, rather than a globe spanning release the Call of Duty series is typically known for.

                              <span>Unity is &quot;likely&quot; to announce layoffs as part of broader cost cutting measures.


As noted in the company&#x27;s Q3 earnings report, Unity is assessing its product portfolio &quot;to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers&quot; and is &quot;evaluating the right cost structure that aligns with the more focused portfolio&quot;.


Changes will be completed before the end of Q1 in 2024, which will &quot;likely include discontinuing certain product offerings, reducing our workforce, and reducing our office footprint&quot; (thanks The Verge).

                              <span>It&#x27;s been just over two years since acclaimed animated League of Legends spin-off Arcane launched on Netflix, but finally its long-awaited second season has the closest thing to a release date yet. The bad news is there&#x27;s still a long wait in store; the streaming service has now confirmed Arcane season two will launch in November 2024.


The first season of Arcane told the story of sisters Jinx and Vi - two of League of Legends most popular champions - as they find themselves caught on different sides of a conflict between the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun, which hits boiling point after the invention of Hextech technology.


Hailee Steinfeld and Ella Purnell will reprise their roles as Vi and Jinx in Arcane&#x27;s upcoming second season - which fans have been waiting for since it was confirmed to be happening shortly after the release of season one - with Katie Leung also set to return as Caitlyn Kiramman.

In a statement provided to Eurogamer after news of layoffs at the studio was broken via PC Gamer, Digital Extremes wrote, &quot;We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division.&quot;


&quot;We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result,&quot; the statement continued, &quot;and we&#x27;re working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in the coming months.&quot;

                              <span>Remnant 2&#x27;s first expansion, The Awakened King, is right around the corner, and ahead of its release next Tuesday, 14th November, developer Gunfire Games has revealed a second copy of the DLC won&#x27;t be required to play it with a friend.


The Awakened King, to provide a bit of context, introduces a new storyline focusing on the Root-corrupted (and decidedly peeved) One True King. It&#x27;ll see players attempting to uncover his secrets by exploring the seaside town of the Forlorn Coast, a new area of Losomn containing dungeons and &quot;unexpected allies&quot;. It also adds news weapons and equipment, new enemies and bosses, plus the new Ritualist archetype.


It sounds like a good solid chunk of stuff for Remnant 2 fans to get stuck into, then, and Gunfire Games has now confirmed over on social media that players won&#x27;t need to own a copy of The Awakened King themselves in order to play through its storyline and visit its new location with a friend that&#x27;s already made a purchase.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been over three years since developer Jonathan Blow announced his critically acclaimed, time-manipulating platform-puzzler Braid was getting an Anniversary Edition, but, finally, a release is in sight; it&#x27;s coming to Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Netflix mobile on April 30th, 2024.


Given that Braid initially launched for Xbox 360 all the way back in August 2008, its Anniversary Edition will be arriving squarely within its 15th birthday year, and a significant amount of work has been done on the original release to celebrate that milestone.


For starters, Braid&#x27;s gorgeous visuals have been &quot;hand-repainted&quot; by original artist David Hellman. Today&#x27;s press release doesn&#x27;t elaborate on that much, but when the Anniversary Edition was announced in 2020, Blow said his Thekla Inc. studio was working on enhanced foregrounds and backgrounds, increased level of detail in certain areas, plus extra animations and effects to improve the feel of movement.

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Deck OLED, a revamped version of its popular handheld PC which boasts - as you might guess - a shiny new OLED screen as its star feature.


Steam Deck OLED retains the existing size and main technical specs of the current Steam Deck (so all current Steam Deck verified games will run the same on OLED models), but includes an improved display that&#x27;s bigger and uses HDR.


The new OLED models go on sale next week, on 16th November at 6pm UK time priced at $549 for a 512GB model or $649 for a 1TB model. (There&#x27;s also a lower $399 price right now for the 256GB current LCD model, which is sticking around as an entry-price alternative.)

                              <span>Don&#x27;t expect Steam Deck 2.0 anytime soon, Valve has said, as the technology to launch a handheld with an adequately beefy jump in power just doesn&#x27;t yet exist.


Speaking to Eurogamer ahead of today&#x27;s Steam Deck OLED announcement, Valve engineers discussed the features it is adding to its shinier new handheld model that were not possible to provide back when the original Steam Deck debuted. 


The company also said it was working on game projects - plural - right now which were still targeting current Steam Deck hardware performance levels (which remain unchanged in the OLED).

                              <span>As we stroll gamely into month two of Sea of Thieves&#x27; extremely long-delayed Season 10, Rare has announced that the second of its three big tentpole features - the new PvP-focused Skull of the Siren Song voyage - will arrive next Thursday, 16th November.


The Skull of the Siren Song provides a more action-orientated addition to Rare&#x27;s piratical multiplayer adventure following the introduction of Guilds last month, essentially unfolding as an opt-in server-wide race to find the titular jewel-encrusted treasure.


Crews can opt-in to the new voyage whenever a ghostly note randomly appears on their ship&#x27;s mast during play. Once a sufficient number of teams are signed up, Captain Briggsy appears to hand them all two maps maps - one pointing to a chest containing the fabled skull, the other to the key required to open it - whereupon a messy dash to retrieve them both is likely to ensue. But there&#x27;s a little more mischief once the cursed skull has been found: any ship that houses it will significantly slow down, meaning it&#x27;s likely to change hands a number of times before one dedicated crew manages to cash it in at an outpost.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth may include a 17 minute CG film to recap the events of Final Fantasy 7 Remake.


That&#x27;s according to a Korean forum for the forthcoming game, which claims producer Yoshinori Kitase mentioned in an interview a certain segment of the Rebirth trailer was actually taken from this CG sequence, which will be available to view at any time.


Final Fantasy streamer Aitai Kimochi shared the news on X, formerly Twitter, but noted the Korean forum doesn&#x27;t list an exact source for the interview.

                              <span>Strauss Zelnick, boss of GTA publisher Take-Two, has credited the company&#x27;s &quot;three-part strategy&quot; as the reason it has managed to avoid mass layoffs this year.


As we have reported numerous times over the past several months, the video game industry has seen layoffs after layoffs this year. This has resulted in studios being closed, such as Saints Row developer Volition. Others, such as Epic, have seen their numbers significantly reduced. 


According to Zelnick, Take-Two has managed to avoid such consequences thanks to moderate investments and a focus on efficiency over recent years.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto 6 could contain generative AI, according to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick.
Speaking at the Paley International Council Summit on 7th November, Zelnick highlighted AI&#x27;s potential in game development, specifically for NPCs (as reported by Inverse).
Interactions between players and NPCs are normally scripted, which Zelnick described as &quot;generally not very interesting&quot;. Using AI to generate dialogue trees and add variety could make the interactions &quot;really interesting and fun&quot;, he stated.

                              <span>Broken Roads, the upcoming narrative-driven cRPG from developer Drop Bear Bytes, has been delayed.


The game was set to release in just a few days time, on 14th November. However, the developer has now announced it has delayed the game at the last minute to &quot;allow for additional polish time&quot;. More work is needed to make sure Broken Roads isn&#x27;t broken on release, essentially, with the help of more QA testing.


In a post on Steam, the Broken Roads team stated the game was &quot;content complete&quot; but &quot;coming in longer&quot; than originally expected. The developer said its roughly 30 hours of gameplay and vast dialogue had made it &quot;extremely time-consuming to properly test&quot; all of the game&#x27;s content.

That&#x27;s according to its latest financial earnings report, where hardware sales for the last quarter were 4.9m - a Q2 record for a PlayStation console. As previously reported in August, Sony had then sold 41.7m units.


Sony stated these sales were in-line with expectations and a 25 percent increase on PS4 units sold in the equivalent period (Q2 FY17). Further, the 4.9m PS5 consoles sold in Q2 is a 48 percent increase compared to last year, likely owing to increased stock.

                              <span>Starfield&#x27;s protagonist is silent, but that wasn&#x27;t always the case. Sam Coe&#x27;s voice actor Elias Toufexis has revealed he recorded lines as the voice of the male lead, while Cissy Jones did so as the game&#x27;s female protagonist.


In a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, Toufexis said both he and Jones &quot;worked for months&quot; providing dialogue for the main player character. 


But, as we all know to be the case, Bethesda ultimately decided Starfield&#x27;s protagonist should remain silent.

                              <span>The soundtrack for upcoming release Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth has leaked online, following the release of Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name yesterday.
The files, which are circulating online, were found in the data of Gaiden, which has a &quot;special trial version&quot; of Infinite Wealth included.
Gaiden has already broken the series&#x27; concurrent peak player count on Steam, as recorded by SteamDB,  with 9743 players jumping in on launch day.

                              <span>A long time ago, in a press release that now seems far, far away, mobile game maker Zynga announced arena squad shooter Star Wars: Hunters for Nintendo Switch and smartphones. 


But in the years since, Star Wars: Hunters has been repeatedly delayed, with an original 2021 launch window turning into 2022, then 2023, and now - as of last night - 2024.


In a statement issued to X, formerly Twitter, last night, Zynga said it had made the &quot;difficult decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters to 2024&quot;, without providing any more concrete launch details.

Sony announced the sales milestone today as part of its most recent financial results, prompting developer Insomniac to share the news more widely on X (formerly Twitter), alongside a rather pleased-looking Kraven the Hunter gif. 


&quot;Thank you to our incredible community for supporting us and helping us reach this milestone!&quot; the developer wrote, as Kraven &#x27;Whooped&#x27; below.

Back in February 2022, Sony stated it aimed to launch over 10 new live service games. The news came days after it acquired Destiny developer Bungie



Now, however, it seems plans are being scaled back to ensure each live service game&#x27;s quality, as Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki explained on a call discussing the company&#x27;s latest financial results (thanks VGC).

It&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve got an impression of how the game will look, with fantasy Lego characters such as a knight and a pirate with a peg-leg, and what looks like a dragon flying through the sky.


The artwork was spotted on the PlayStation Store and shared on social media by industry analyst MauroNL, who noted that the product&#x27;s page had since been deleted.

                              <span>Tired of having to explain yourself every time your friends catch you firing up Hosiery Party: Wet Potato Frenzy on Steam? Well, there&#x27;s some good news: Valve is reportedly readying a feature that&#x27;ll let you mark specific games as &quot;private&quot; so you can hide your more unusual tastes from other users while still maintaining a public profile.


At present, Steam&#x27;s privacy settings don&#x27;t support the kind of granularity needed to hide individual games, only enabling users to dictate broad categories - game details, friends list, inventory, screenshots, and workshop items - to keep discreet.


As spotted by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik, however (thanks PC Gamer), Valve is seemingly poised to add a &#x27;mark as private&#x27; setting to individual titles, so they can specifically be hidden from the prying eyes of friends. That means you won&#x27;t have to lock down huge chunks of your profile just to avoid difficult questions about the amount of time you&#x27;ve been playing Coquettish Elbow Reveal VR Edition. Or, in my case, 400 straight hours of Disney Dreamlight Valley.

                              <span>As part of its latest earnings call, Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav has outlined the company&#x27;s plans to transform its biggest gaming franchises from traditional console and PC releases into &quot;always on&quot; live service games.


Zaslav made the comments during his opening remarks to investors, in which referred to several of the company&#x27;s franchises - Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Batman, and Mortal Kombat - as $1bn gaming properties. Developer NetherRealm&#x27;s Mortal Kombat 1, he noted, has sold nearly 3m copies since launching in mid-September this year.


&quot;Our focus,&quot; he continued, &quot;is on transforming our biggest franchises from largely console and PC based with three-four year release schedules to include more always on gameplay through live services, multiplatform and free-to-play extensions, with the goal to have more players spending more time on more platforms.&quot;

                              <span>As reports of a Switch successor continue to build momentum, despite carefully phrased rebuffs from Nintendo, the Mario maker has said it&#x27;ll continue to release titles for its current console &quot;without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle.&quot;


Nintendo made the statement (thanks GameInformer) as part of its latest earnings report - in which it also confirmed Switch sales have now surpassed 132m units - writing, &quot;Switch will be entering its eighth year in March 2024. We will continue to release new titles and content for Nintendo Switch without being bound by the traditional concept of the platform lifecycle.&quot; 


The inference (which isn&#x27;t the same as confirmation, of course) is that should a Switch successor launch next year, as is widely reported, Nintendo won&#x27;t be viewing it as end-of-life for its existing machine. That&#x27;s perhaps not much of a surprise given it&#x27;ll still have a substantial number of current Switch owners clamouring for new content with no plans to immediately upgrade, but it&#x27;s something of a departure from its traditional release strategy.

                              <span>Time Splitters studio Free Radical is reportedly the latest developer to be affected by Embracer Group&#x27;s sweeping restructuring programme, with the studio said to be facing closure.


Free Radical&#x27;s history is a long one and complicated one; the studio was founded in 1999 by a number of ex-Rare developers and quickly made a name for itself with the much-loved TimeSplitters FPS series. In 2009, after several difficult years, it was acquired by Crytek, becoming Crytek UK, who then sold it to Deep Silver in 2014, where it became Dambuster Studios - which made this year&#x27;s Dead Island 2. However, in May 2021, Deep Silver announced it was reviving the Free Radical name and creating a new studio specifically to make more TimeSplitters, with original Free Radical co-founders Steve Ellis and David Doak at the helm.


Unfortunately, VGC now reports this new Free Radical is the latest studio to be impacted by parent company Embracer Group&#x27;s major restructuring programme, which was announced following the collapse of a massive $2bn deal in May and has resulted in extensive layoffs and closures throughout 2023.

The internet has leapt upon the announcement to suggest various names for Link, but who can you really see in the role - and can it not be Tom Holland, please? And definitely not Mark Wahlberg as an aged Link from the future. 
We also discuss the Zelda film&#x27;s potential story, and whether we think it will adapt any particular Zelda legend or simply follow the Mario movie&#x27;s example and go through the usual plot beats. Plus: the inevitable references Nintendo must include. And also... live-action Tingle? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Persona 5 Tactica was playable via Steam this afternoon, nine days before its official launch.
It looks like alert emails from Steam went out notifying fans of the game&#x27;s release, prompting some to download it and begin playing.
The mishap was fixed about 20 minutes later, after which the release date went through a rollercoaster of changes, including 31st December 1969, before ending up (correctly) on 17th November, 2023.

Other titles we recommend checking out from Humble Choice&#x27;s November games are the retro-inspired sci-fi shooter Prodeus and spaceship salvaging simulator Hardspace Shipbreaker.
We crowned Unpacking our game of the year in 2021 for its human storytelling and satisfying puzzles of tidying things up. In her Unpacking review, Malindy Hetfield called the game a &quot;calm and tactile little sim&quot; which also allows players &quot;personal expression and finding fun in what&#x27;s literally just stuff&quot;.

                              <span>Rockstar will officially announce Grand Theft Auto 6 in the coming days, it&#x27;s been reported. 

Bloomberg sources have laid out Rockstar&#x27;s likely announcement plan for the game, with a brief announcement &quot;as early as this week&quot; and then a trailer for the game next month, in December. 


December&#x27;s trailer will come 25 years after the founding of Rockstar in December 1998, and a little over a decade since the original launch of Grand Theft Auto 5.

                              <span>Still doubtless beaming from the runaway success of this year&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. movie, Shigeru Miyamoto has confirmed a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie is in the works.


Details are sparse at present, but Miyamoto, announcing the news on Nintendo Japan&#x27;s Twitter/X account, said the project has already been in development for &quot;many years now&quot;. As per an accompanying press release, Miyamoto will produce the movie - which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution) - with Avi Arad, responsible for &quot;many hit films&quot;, also producing.


Arad&#x27;s films, if you&#x27;re wondering, are primarily (but not exclusively) within the superhero genre, ranging from this year&#x27;s acclaimed Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and its celebrated 2018 predecessor, to 2022&#x27;s Tom-Holland-starring Uncharted adaptation, as well as the likes of Venom, Morbius, the live-action Ghost in the Shell, and next year&#x27;s Borderlands movie.

Revenant Hill was officially unveiled back in May, teasing an adventure, set in the year 1919, that would follow Twigs the cat&#x27;s attempts to make ends meet after an &quot;owl from the next hill&quot; began demanding she pay rent on her wet log near an abandoned graveyard.


There were hints of systems reminiscent of farming sims, with crops to be grown and a community to be built as the seasons passed, albeit with a cast of witches, demons, and ghosts, and more serious considerations on its mind. &quot;Times are hard,&quot; The Glory Society wrote at the time, &quot;Something big and dark is at work in the towns, the factories, in the forests and hills. At some point, someone is going to have to push back. And they can&#x27;t do it alone.&quot;

Game Vault, as the new offering is officially known, is only available Crunchyroll members who subscribe to the streaming service&#x27;s Mega Fan or Ultimate Fan tiers. The former costs £5.99/$9.99 USD a month, while the latter is a US-only addition, priced at $14.99 USD.


Alongside their existing subscription benefits - which currently includes ad-free streaming of anime, simulcast shows, digital manga, and offline viewing - eligible members will gain access to a growing library of downloadable mobile games, albeit initially only available on Android (via the Google Play store), but with iOS support coming &quot;soon&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Red Hook Studios has announced a first paid DLC pack for its acclaimed horror sequel Darkest Dungeon 2. It&#x27;s called The Binding Blade and will introduce two new heroes - one who&#x27;ll be familiar to fans of the first game - when it arrives in December.


Darkest Dungeon 2 left early access back in May this year, taking players on a grim Lovecraftian road trip that Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a &quot;copious and often brilliant, if not quite unmissable reworking of a powerfully grim fantasy&quot; in his Recommended review.


It&#x27;s a solid foundation, then, and Red Hook will initially build on Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s oppressive, tactical turn-based core by introducing two new playable heroes (or, perhaps more accurately, anti-heroes), along with a few other bits, when The Binding Blade arrives.

It&#x27;s unclear, however, whether this means these are coming in Mass Effect 5 - still several years away - or sooner, as part of N7 Day itself.


&quot;We&#x27;ve asked ourselves many of the same questions you&#x27;ve asked us over the years!&quot; Mass Effect boss Mike Gamble wrote. &quot;What happened to everyone you know and love in the games? Who really died? Who had kids with whom? What does a baby volus sound like?

Nintendo showcased Switch 2 hardware capabilities to game developers in August around Gamescom in Cologne, Eurogamer reported at the time.

                              <span>The long-rumoured but unannounced Silent Hill: The Short Message has had its plot details leaked by the Australian government&#x27;s rating body. 
The Short Message first popped up in September 2022, when it was rated in South Korea by The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea.

                              <span>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s short campaign may be getting mixed feedback, but it does at least feature a cameo appearance from the series&#x27; best canine boy. 


Fans have found that there&#x27;s a pettable dog (of course) featured during the game&#x27;s Trojan Horse mission, which you are encouraged to go stroke while attempting to blend into the level&#x27;s crowds. 


Linger on and continue looking at said dog after petting it and its name will soon pop up: Riley, the lovable German Shepherd who served as a squad member in Call of Duty Ghosts.

The game&#x27;s developer Behaviour Interactive pulled this content from the game back in November 2021 due to an expiration of its licensing agreement with Netflix.

According to its latest financial report from April to September 2023, company operating income has dropped by 33 percent and ordinary income by 42 percent.


That&#x27;s despite an increase in sales for its HD Games, owing to the releases of Final Fantasy 16 and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 looks set to receive a new difficulty mode which will restrict players to one save file and permadeath.
A new achievement for the game called Foehammer, which references an Honour mode, has been spotted on the GOG launcher and shared on the game&#x27;s subreddit. Fans of developer Larian Studios have recognised Honour mode from its previous appearances in Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition and Divinity: Original Sin 2. 
In the Divinity games, Honour mode only allows players one save, regardless of whether it was a manual, auto, or quick save. Permadeath is enabled, and if the player&#x27;s entire party dies the save is erased. That&#x27;s all on top of the extra difficulty added by Tactician mode, the second most difficult option after Honour mode.

An update for Mirage launches today for PC, PlayStation and Xbox which adds a toggle for the visual effect. There had been numerous fan complaints that it was simply too distracting, and many requests for it to be switched off or toned down.


You can download the update (version 1.0.5) from 1pm UK time and try the option for yourself. Download sizes for the update range from around 3 to 5GB, depending on platform.

&quot;It&#x27;s been a thrilling week for the entire team, one that we&#x27;ll never forget. We&#x27;re utterly dazzled by your kindness, openness, and excitement throughout the entire Open Beta period,&quot; it wrote in a blog post over on Steam.

The group has chosen today - 7th November - as it is BioWare&#x27;s N7 Day, an annual celebration of the developer&#x27;s Mass Effect franchise.


13 former testers were employed by Keywords Studios but seconded to BioWare to work on 2021&#x27;s brilliant Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy remaster. This group then worked on the upcoming Dragon Age Dreadwolf - before a dispute erupted over their continuing ability to work remotely.

                              <span>The Epic Games Store still isn&#x27;t profitable.


That&#x27;s according to Epic Games Store boss Steve Allison, who was speaking during a court hearing on Monday. 


As reported by The Verge, the exec was talking during the current Epic vs Google court case. Here, Allison said while the Epic Games Store still isn&#x27;t profitable, the company&#x27;s focus remains on &quot;growth&quot;. Additionally, according to emails shared during the trial, Epic had hoped to claim half of all gaming revenue for PC games.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Switch console has now passed 132m units sold, but the company is remaining silent on its successor.


According to Nintendo&#x27;s latest report detailing sales over the last financial quarter, Switch sales are still going strong. Unit sales for the Switch family of consoles rose 2.4 percent year-on-year, with the OLED model the most popular. A further 4.69m Switch OLEDs were sold, as clearly players are willing to spend extra on the improved screen, or to simply upgrade from the older model.


On a conference call after the earnings release, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa refused to comment on plans for a Switch successor, despite rumours of a 2024 release.

                              <span>Sony is dropping Twitter integration from its PlayStation consoles starting next Monday, 13th November, mirroring similar decisions made by Xbox and Blizzard earlier this year.


Twitter (or X, if you must) integration has long been a part of PlayStation&#x27;s operating system, giving users a quick and convenient way to share screenshots, videos, Trophy achievements, and more to social media. Unfortunately, all that&#x27;s about to end.


&quot;As of November 13, 2023,&quot; Sony wrote on its support site, &quot;integration with X...will no longer function on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles. This includes the ability to view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).&quot;

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 studio Colossal Order has pledged not to release paid DLC for its city building sequel until its heavily criticised performance issues have been &quot;fixed to our standards&quot;.


Performance concerns have, of course, dogged Cities: Skylines 2 even before its release, with Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive taking the unprecedented step of warning potential buyers that it had &quot;not achieved the benchmark we targeted&quot; prior to launch - but then going ahead and releasing it anyway because &quot;releasing now is the best way forward.&quot;


In the weeks since, Colossal Order has continued to chip away at Cities: Skylines 2&#x27;s performance issues and bugs (even the ones definitely not related to teeth), and it&#x27;s now followed-up last week&#x27;s patch with a new blog detailing some of the changes to come.

                              <span>Embracer&#x27;s chief operating officer has left the company, amid a wave of restructuring and studio closures.


Announcing his departure on LinkedIn, Egil Strunke said he had &quot;reached a checkpoint&quot;, before adding it was time for a new project.


&quot;Last week I left Embracer Group as COO, and it&#x27;s with mixed feelings I am parting ways [with] this global company phenomenon, rooted in Karlstad, Sweden,&quot; Strunke wrote. &quot;On one hand grateful for having had the chance to work with the one-of-a-kind Lars Wingefors [Embracer&#x27;s CEO] and all the other AMAZING colleagues (too many to mention!) which I will be sad to leave. On the other hand excited about the opportunities that lie ahead - starting and building my own company: Strunke Games.&quot;

Adele told the story of her homemade Rust outfit to the audience during one of her recent Las Vegas residency shows, as spotted by VGC.
The segment started off with Adele asking if anyone in the audience was a gamer, and whether they&#x27;d heard of the survival sandbox game before.

However, when the time does come for this presentation, Aonuma will join fellow Nintendo creator Shigeru Miyamoto as one of the few in the video game industry to be bestowed with the honour.

Chinese modder Last孤影众  (Gūyǐng zhòng) has created the Land of Reeds mod, which - among other changes - adds the rot boss to Sekiro, which YouTuber Ongbal tested out last month (thanks PC Gamer).


Yes, that means parrying every hit of Malenia&#x27;s Waterfowl Dance attack. That alone is quite the feat, though Ongbal&#x27;s Wolf is more than a match.

Amongst them, Best Buy has attracted attention for the following line in the product description: &quot;Fan-favourite character, Pyramid Head, makes a return along with a special origin story for fans to play through.&quot;

                              <span>Two months on from the release of Starfield, players are still waiting for Bethesda to address the numerous bugs which are present. But there&#x27;s a whole other group of players out there taking matters into their own hands - the team behind the Starfield Community Patch, an ambitious and surprisingly professional taskforce trying to fix the game themselves. The project came under the spotlight about a month before Starfield released. It was wild to think that a group of modders could already be working on a mod for Starfield before it had even released, but there they were - anticipating the Bethesda jank fans have come to expect. 


The SCP&#x27;s goal is to improve the vanilla experience of Starfield for players by fixing everything from major bugs to spelling errors, so long as it presents some sort of issue for players of the base game. The scope of the patch doesn&#x27;t include new content, balance changes (outside of correcting obvious errors), or anything which doesn&#x27;t fit with Bethesda&#x27;s original vision for the game.


I spoke to Timothy &quot;Halgari&quot; Baldridge, one of the founders of the SCP, to find out why the team came together to, in essence, do Bethesda&#x27;s work for them, and ask whether they&#x27;ve ever had any contact with Bethesda. I came away from our chat with a deeper appreciation for the project, which is more than just a simple effort to improve the experience of Starfield. It&#x27;s a collaborative effort between several modders and players to create a truly community-owned, open-source project, with standard practices of software development in place.

Narrative director Ben Arfmann and advanced writer Brittney Morris discussed how the ending of Spider-Man 2 will impact the likes of Peter, Miles and MJ, and spoke about a change of focus for Insomniac&#x27;s series.

                              <span>Two Diablo 4 developers have dropped a big hint about a previously-denied secret cow level in the game fans have been searching for.


As previously reported, Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson stated there&#x27;s &quot;no secret level&quot;, but this hasn&#x27;t stopped fans from hunting for one. There was seemingly a breakthrough made last month, too, after a player acquired a mysterious relic that required killing exactly 666 cows.


Now, at this weekend&#x27;s BlizzCon 2023, production director Tiffany Wat and associate game director Joe Piepiora hinted the secret cow level might be real after all.

                              <span>A new tour celebrating the &quot;most iconic video game music&quot; will kick off in May next year.

After two sold-out shows at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, Video Games in Concert is set to tour the UK next summer, stopping off in Brighton, Liverpool, Wolverhampton, Manchester, and Bournemouth. Sadly, there are no dates outside of England at this time. 

&quot;Video Games in Concert is a critically acclaimed concert series that features one of the world’s premier composers of video games scores, Eímear Noone, who is responsible for some of the most enduring soundscapes on World of Warcraft and other best-selling video games,&quot; a press release says.

                              <span>Comparisons between the OG PS5 and the PS5 Slim are out, and some say the sleeker new design is &quot;not that much smaller&quot; than its chunkier sibling.

Dave2D has provided a detailed teardown of the brand-new console system, showing off the machine&#x27;s trimmer stature and the console&#x27;s new outer cover, which now boasts a half matte, half gloss finish. This means any panels bought for the original system cannot be used on the updated one, as it essentially has four separate pieces. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dave2D made specific mention of the weight difference. Whilst the original version weighs in at either 3.9kg or 3.3kg, depending upon whether or not you have the digital version or the system with the disc drive, the new models weighs 3.2kg or 2.6kg respectively.

                              <span>The Flipper Zero is an incredibly versatile hacking device. Now it can be used to crash iPhones in its vicinity by sending them a never-ending stream of pop-ups.
These types of hacks have been possible for decades, but they require special equipment and a fair amount of expertise. The capabilities generally required expensive SDRs­—short for software-defined radios­—that, unlike traditional hardware-defined radios, use firmware and processors to digitally re-create radio signal transmissions and receptions. The $200 Flipper Zero isn’t an SDR in its own right, but as a software-controlled radio, it can do many of the same things at an affordable price and with a form factor that’s much more convenient than the previous generations of SDRs...</span>

As tracked by Fortnite.gg, the return of Fortnite&#x27;s original map – dubbed Fortnite OG by developer Epic – has seen an influx of players, with the battle royale mode itself also breaking records when it hit a new high of 3,109,888 simultaneous players yesterday, too.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Epic has had to keep a close eye on server health and capacity, warning players that they may &quot;experience a short queue&quot; before logging in at peak times.

Players aged 16+ on PC and Android/iOS devices can apply now to be in with a chance of securing a spot in the beta, although miHoYo stresses that the test is only open to &quot;limited accounts&quot; and all data will be deleted at the end.  

Right now, it&#x27;s unclear when the beta test will run or even how long you have to get your name down on the list, but all interested parties are invited to complete the pre-registration and &quot;Equalising Test&quot; sign-up survey to &quot;successfully sign up for a chance to win Equalising Test Qualification&quot;.

                              <span>Blizzard has revealed that it considers bringing World of Warcraft to consoles &quot;all the time&quot;.

In an interview with GamesRadar at BlizzCon 2023, vice president and executive producer for World of Warcraft Holly Longdale said that whilst the team was currently focussed on the &quot;three expansions&quot; for now, being part of Microsoft&#x27;s extended family means the team talks about making the game available on other platforms &quot;all the time&quot;.

World of Warcraft was released way back in 2004 – which means we&#x27;re just months away from the MMORPG&#x27;s twentieth anniversary – and has only been playable on PC for all that time.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 will be released on Xbox on 6th December, 2023.

That&#x27;s according to noted leaker eXtas1s, who says that &quot;if playtests proceed as planned&quot;, this date is &quot;what Larian has targeted for the game&#x27;s Xbox version at the moment&quot;.

As noted by r/GamingLeaksandRumours, eXtas1s has a pretty good track record for breaking release dates ahead of announcements, and had previously given us Forza Motorsport&#x27;s street date before Xbox formally confirmed it.

Similarly asked if the horror was coming to Switch, Puppet Combo had the same reply: &quot;No, it&#x27;s too crazy for Switch&quot;.

The fighting community is currently making its views very known on the series&#x27; subreddit community, generating thousands of upvotes. 

Although neither the developer nor publisher Warner Bros. have expressly said that alternate skins would not be available, players noted that at the end of the recent Omni-Man gameplay trailer, there was no mention of any additional skins bundled in with premium DLC characters.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 3 players with early access to Call of Duty&#x27;s latest instalment have taken to social media to share their dismay – and outrage – about the shooter&#x27;s campaign.
Although the first-person shooter doesn&#x27;t formally release until 10th November, some players who&#x27;ve forked out for the shooter&#x27;s pricier digital editions can play the campaign early via &quot;early access&quot;.

&quot;I played one hour of campaign and got my refund,&quot; announced one player. &quot;And I think you should too if you feel the same way I felt. This was a couple lacklustre raid episodes out together; having just finished COD Remastered recently this game failed to capture what it means to be in a campaign, and if this is how it all begins then I’m sorry, MW3 does not redeem itself from the shitshow MW2 caused at launch and somehow continues to make fun of my wallet. I’ll be holding off on touching this game until something positive comes back from this community. Peace.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft is officially winding down support for Far Cry 6.

In a post shared on Twitter/X, the publisher/developer thanked the &quot;millions of players&quot; who&#x27;d taken on Yara&#x27;s fight so far, adding that whilst there would be no &quot;interruption to online services&quot; of Far Cry 6, the team would &quot;no longer be making updates&quot; for the open world adventure.

&quot;Thanks to the millions of players who joined the fight!&quot; the message said. &quot;Your adventures can continue in Yara [without] interruption of online services, however, the dev team will no longer be making updates to Far Cry 6.

                              <span>BlizzCon is back - as an in-person event for the first time in four years - and Blizzard kicked off its opening ceremony with a bit of an Overwatch 2 blowout, including a reveal for the series&#x27; 39th hero, chaingun-wielding tank Mauga.


Mauga&#x27;s announcement wasn&#x27;t, admittedly, much of a surprise, giving he inadvertently got a pre-show unveiling on Switch&#x27;s eShop news channel, but he&#x27;s now been made official thanks to BlizzCon. And, as seen in his reveal trailer, Mauga - which means &quot;mountain&quot; in Samoan - is armed with two chainguns: affectionately known as Gunny and Cha-Cha.


Gunny is an incendiary chaingun, whose bullets will burn enemies that receive sufficient damage; Cha-Cha, meanwhile, is a a &quot;volatile&quot; chaingun that deals critical burn damage. Blizzard notes they can either be fired individually or in unison.

                              <span>BlizzCon has brought big news for World of Warcraft fans as the MMO prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary next year; Blizzard&#x27;s announced not only its next expansion, The War Within, but the two coming after that, all forming chapters in the newly revealed Worldsoul Saga.


The Worldsoul Saga was enthusiastically unveiled by Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen, who returned to the company late last year after departing in 2016. This new World of Warcraft story arc is set to play out across multiple expansions over the next few years, starting with The War Within - WoW&#x27;s tenth expansion - in 2024.


The War Within takes players into heart of Azeroth itself, where they&#x27;ll explore new subterranean kingdoms, engage with ancient cultures like the Earthen Dwarves - a new Allied race - and the terrifying Nerubians of Azj-Kahet. Azj-Kahet is one of several new zones coming in the expansion, alongside the Isle of Dorn, The Ringing Deeps, and Hallowfall.

                              <span>With this year&#x27;s BlizzCon now firmly underway, Blizzard has been whipping up the crowds with a bunch of announcements during its Opening Ceremony, including initial details on Diablo 4&#x27;s first expansion. It&#x27;s called Vessel of Hatred and it&#x27;s due &quot;late&quot; next year.


Vessel of Hatred - said to still be &quot;super early&quot; in development - continues the story of base game antagonist Prime Evil Mephisto, and introduces a new region to Diablo 4: the lush jungles of Torajan, last seen in Diablo 2.


Blizzard isn&#x27;t saying much more about Vessel of Hatred just yet but it does tease that it&#x27;ll feature &quot;new ways to play&quot;, &quot;new evils to vanquish&quot;, plus a new class never before see in the Diablo universe. There&#x27;s also a (not especially informative) teaser trailer to accompany the news.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever paused mid-slaughter during a game of Vampires Survivors and thought to yourself, &#x27;Yes, but what&#x27;s my motivation?&#x27;, you&#x27;ll want to ready yourself for the minimalist survival RPG&#x27;s next free update. As per studio Poncle&#x27;s latest development update, a new story driven, lore-infused Adventures mode will soon be on the way.


Poncle has teased Adventures before, describing them as a remix of content adding a bit of extra &quot;flavour&quot; through new stage progression and descriptions. Now though, via the medium of FAQ it&#x27;s gone into considerably more detail, explaining Adventures are essentially self-contained miniature story campaigns - some available as part of the base game, others tied to specific DLC - that&#x27;ll follow the game&#x27;s cast of Survivors on a series of &quot;wacky sidequests.&quot;


Adventures unlock at set points during the main game or their associated DLC, and feature a unique progression path that&#x27;ll see players starting from scratch (main game unlocks won&#x27;t be affected) using a specific character and item set-up as they attempt to complete a series of custom challenges with a limited arsenal. Those challenges might, for instance, require players to survive a certain amount of time or kill a set amount of enemies, and there&#x27;ll be bits of lore text forming a mini story arc along the way.

                              <span>Fresh footage as well as a playable prototype of a cancelled Daredevil game have appeared online.


Known as Daredevil: The Man Without Fear, this prototype was initially conceived all the way back in 2004, but the full game was never released. It has since come back into circulation, however, with the prototype being shared online by an anonymous developer who worked on it almost 20 years ago.


You can find this Daredevil prototype, along with several screenshots, over on Hidden Palace. According to the notes included with the prototype, The Man Without Fear was being developed for the PC, PS2 and Xbox, and was set to be a &quot;third-person beat &#x27;em up&quot; style game.

                              <span>Activision and Xbox have teamed up to release full screen ads for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on the console&#x27;s homepage, which players have since heavily criticised.


As shared by multiple users on social media, the ad in question pops up when players boot up their Xbox. &quot;Fight against the ultimate threat,&quot; the screen proclaims. 


It then suggests you perhaps buy the game ahead of its full release later this month (as a reminder, you can play the Campaign early if you pre-order). Your three options are simply &quot;Buy Now&quot;, &quot;Get the Vault Edition Upgrade&quot; and, mercifully, the option to &quot;Exit&quot; away from this ad and get on with what you actually booted up your Xbox for.

In a new interview with Automaton, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama and chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said Gaiden was made in half a year, with the former seemingly making a slight jest at Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 released last month, with the promise of more content to come after launch. This will include a New Game Plus mode, known as The Final Draft, which will add some kind of alternative story.


The game&#x27;s two DLCs - Night Springs and The Lake House - have also been teased by developer Remedy. Both of these are due to arrive sometime next year, and while the Alan Wake 2 team has alluded to what will be included, dataminers have managed to dig even deeper into the game and found more details about what&#x27;s next.

Please note, there will be spoilers for Alan Wake 2 and its relation to the Remedy Connected Universe below. If you are keen to keep the game as much of a surprise as possible, this is your cue to head elsewhere.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a new Blizzard game available today, very slightly earlier than planned. 


Warcraft Rumble is the company&#x27;s new free-to-play tower defence strategy title for mobile devices, featuring a cast of familiar faces from the World of Warcraft universe. 


Originally announced last year as Arclight Rumble, Blizzard&#x27;s latest effort arrived on app stores last night, a day ahead of this evening&#x27;s big BlizzCon opening ceremony.

Players complained that some of the game&#x27;s bosses were too easy - this is a challenging Soulslike after all - but now the likes of the Sanctified Huntress, Griefbound, the Sundered One, and &quot;a boss at the bottom of a very dark place&quot; will be more formidable.


What&#x27;s more, the Scarlet Shadow has been made more difficult to cheese - that&#x27;s the reaper who chases players in Umbral. Now, he no longer takes fall damage and players can no longer hide and shoot him from above.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we share our warp pipe dreams for Mario Kart 9, as the final wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC gets its release date.
Nintendo has elongated the lifespan of its Wii U Mario Kart creation to last the entirety of the Switch era - and now we&#x27;ve reached the point where pretty much every track from the series worth playing has been crammed inside. So what&#x27;s next, if Nintendo can&#x27;t simply go bigger? Fresh ideas are needed, we feel. 
When will the Mario Kart series get a course creator? Is this the time - so that Nintendo can hand over some creative control to the community, and run the game as more of a live service platform? How about changes to the game&#x27;s characters, with special abilities to make different racers feel unique? And what about the idea of turning Mario Kart into more of a Nintendo Kart, with additional crossover franchises? Joining me to discuss are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is almost upon us (its campaign early access is upon us for those eager enough to have pre-ordered the game), and system requirements are pointing to an absolutely behemoth install size of more than 200GB in some cases come its full launch next Friday, 10th November - and Activision has now moved to explain what&#x27;s going on.


In a statement shared on social media, the publisher blamed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s potentially massive hard drive footprint on an &quot;increased amount of content available Day 1&quot;, which includes open world Zombies, support for items being carried forward from Modern Warfare 2, plus map files for the current the Call of Duty: Warzone.


The good news for anyone staring at their dwindling gigabytes like they&#x27;re modelling for Munch&#x27;s The Scream is that Modern Warfare 3 appears to offer a decent amount of control over exactly which bits are and are not installed. &quot;You can manage your Call of Duty files in the &#x27;manage files&#x27; section of the COD HQ launcher menu,&quot; Activision notes. &quot;This includes the ability to uninstall specific content you are not actively playing.&quot;

                              <span>After a week that&#x27;s seen significant layoffs at Bungie, as well as reports of a delay for Destiny 2&#x27;s The Final Shape expansion, the studio has told players &quot;we know we have lost a lot of your trust&quot; and promised to reveal plans to &quot;take us all out of this Darkness and into the Light.&quot;


Reports of widespread layoffs at Bungie began circulating on Monday, and were later confirmed in statement from studio CEO Pete Parsons. Bloomberg later reported around 100 employees - approximately eight percent of Bungie&#x27;s 1200-strong workforce - were affected by the job cuts, and that the layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a &quot;sharp drop&quot; in the popularity of Destiny 2.


Further reports have continued to paint a bleak picture of Destiny 2&#x27;s fortunes; pre-orders for The Final Shape are said to be disappointing, while &quot;good&quot; rather than &quot;great&quot; feedback has reportedly lead management to delay the expansion from February to June next year.

                              <span>Payday 3 hasn&#x27;t exactly had the smoothest of launches; matchmaking issues, online-only requirements, and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system immediately soured its arrival for players back in September, and a highly anticipated first patch promising &quot;200+&quot; quality of life improvements has been repeatedly delayed. Finally though, after much waiting, the heist-shooter&#x27;s 1.01 update is here on all platforms.


Payday 3&#x27;s 1.01 update was initially planned to launch on 5th October, but developer Starbreeze delayed its release to mid-October in order to &quot;ensure its stability&quot;. After weeks of silence, the developer re-emerged to announced another, this time indefinite delay, explaining it had &quot;identified some issues that need to be fixed&quot;.


As the wait has dragged on, Payday 3 player numbers have slumped to the low thousands, with the game&#x27;s predecessor currently pulling in ten times more than the new version. As such, Starbreeze will doubtless be hoping the long-awaited arrival of 1.01 today will help reverse the game&#x27;s fortunes. And it&#x27;s a big one too, weighing in at 2GB (on PC, at least) and spanning an enormous number of improvements and changes.

                              <span>The second season of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation is currently expected to enter production in early 2024.


That&#x27;s according to HBO boss Casey Bloys (as reported by Variety), who shared the news during an HBO press event held in New York earlier today.


Bloys remarked that the recent WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meant production on the upcoming season had been delayed. This was first suggested as a possibility earlier this year and has since been confirmed by members of the show&#x27;s team.

                              <span>The Sims 4 team has lifted the lid on its upcoming expansion pack, known as For Rent. As you may have surmised given its title, this pack will allow players to give property ownership a whirl, and become a landlord. 


&quot;Revel in the hustle and bustle of Tomarang, discover unique items at the Night Market, and come home to a new Residential Rental lot where your neighbours are closer than ever,&quot; the pack&#x27;s official description reads. EA and Maxis describe this new location as a &quot;scenic world nestled in a lush tropical landscape and vibrant city skyline&quot;. It does look rather nice, I have to say.


Meanwhile, as you will be - in the Sims team&#x27;s words - closer than ever, this will mean bumping into neighbours left, right and centre. When you collect your post, they will be there. When you join in with a potluck meal event, they will be there. When you head out for a run, they will be there. In short, there will definitely be a lot more happening in your immediate vicinity when this pack goes live.

&quot;Descended from a lineage of distinguished knights, with a dream to rescue those in need, he followed the footsteps of his father and enlisted in the French Navy before joining the UN following his will to save more people,&quot; Victor&#x27;s official bio reads. &quot;As he felt the world was on the brink of being taken over by a corporate giant, he founded and trained the Raven Force - armed forces that have the authority to act at their own discretion to counter the corporation&#x27;s private armed forces.&quot;


You can see him in action, kitted up with a variety of optical weapons, a very sharp suit and insults such as &quot;bon appétit&quot;, via the video below.

                              <span>The CEO of Silent Hill: Ascension developer Genvid has  defended the game&#x27;s transactions, and said they were there to allow people to &quot;skip time&quot; in gaining in-game currency rather than being a way to &quot;game the system&quot;.


CEO Jacob Navok&#x27;s comments come after the game&#x27;s second night of new content, and amid backlash to its monetisation scheme. 

Navok posted last night on X, formerly Twitter, to respond to a wave of complaints about the game and attempt to explain Ascension&#x27;s economy, which consists of in-game currency earned by playing mini-puzzles and completing live-service style tasks, whilst also providing context on the removal of global live chat.

Data published by Konvoy as part of its Q3 2023 Gaming Industry Report show a sharp decline in investments following the second quarter of last year. 


As noted by EA Dice senior game designer Jan David Hassel, who shared these graphs on social media, investment in gaming surged to $14.78bn in 2021, and to 14.49bn in 2022. In 2023, this has now slumped to $2.09bn - around &quot;a seventh of the investment of each of the previous two years&quot;.

                              <span>The powers that be at Larian are continuing to issue fixes for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.


Today sees the arrival of Patch 4, which - as with previous patches - is so chunky, it has exceeded Steam&#x27;s text limit. 


With this update in play, those making their way through the game&#x27;s many acts can expect to see many improvements across the board, but some particular highlights include the ability to now customise hirelings&#x27; appearance when recruiting them and the addition of a colour blind mode.

                              <span>Elden Ring was by far and away one of the most prolific games of last year. It won itself scores of praise and accolades following its release in February 2022, including topping Eurogamer&#x27;s own Game of the Year list.


This success has left many travellers to the Lands Between eager for more. Thankfully, current word is that Elden Ring&#x27;s previously announced DLC expansion is &quot;proceeding smoothly&quot;, despite developer FromSoftware not yet announcing any kind of time frame for its arrival on platforms.


This information comes from FromSoftware&#x27;s parent Kadokawa, via gaming consultant Dr. Serkan Toto. Sharing this update on X (formerly known as Twitter), Toto also added that Armored Core 6 has &quot;sold 700k units in Japan&quot; as of 30th September. However, while it appears Kadokawa is pleased with the game&#x27;s Japanese sales, it is not so happy about its sales elsewhere.

                              <span>Acclaimed Souls-like shooter sequel Remnant 2 is poised to receive its first expansion, The Awakened King, on 17th November, and developer Gunfire Games is celebrating today&#x27;s release date news with a DLC teaser trailer.


The Awakened King features a brand-new storyline focusing on the One True King, a being corrupted by the Root during his near-death slumber and now out for revenge. It&#x27;s up to players to uncover the king&#x27;s secrets by exploring a new area of Losomn - the announcement makes mention of a castle overlooking a Dran coastal town, but doesn&#x27;t explicitly confirm that this is where the DLC is set - containing new dungeons and &quot;unexpected allies&quot;.


There&#x27;s also talk of powerful new weapons and equipment for players to acquire - including new modifications, amulets, and rings - plus fearsome new enemies and bosses, risen from the depths of the ocean and now swarming the streets. And finally, there&#x27;s the new Ritualist archetype, which can leverage status effects to punish foes.

                              <span>Developer Rovio has said it is now blocking a &quot;disturbing&quot; pro-Israel ad featuring graphic content after a Reuters report highlighted its discovery in Angry Birds and a number of other family orientated games.


According to Reuters, the pro-Israel ad - created by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of an &quot;advocacy drive&quot; amid the continuing Israel-Hamas war - featured images of Hamas militants, rocket attacks, terrified Israeli families, explosions, and blurred graphic footage, culminating in the message, &quot;We will make sure that those who harm us pay a heavy price.&quot;


Speaking to Reuters, an Israeli government official confirmed the ads were part of a $1.5m USD campaign but insisted advertisers had been instructed to block the advert &quot;for people under 18&quot;. Despite these instructions, Reuters said it had documented six cases – in Britain, France, Austria, Germany, and Holland – where the adverts had been served in games for children or families.

                              <span>Bethesda has announced it&#x27;ll finally be introducing a number of much-requested graphics features to Starfield on PC next week - including its long-awaited Nvidia DLSS support - with all additions initially arriving as a Steam Beta update prior to general release.


PC players have aired their frustration with Starfield&#x27;s lack of DLSS support since before launch (its absence was initially believed to be the result of Bethesda&#x27;s partnership with AMD, although AMD insisted otherwise), and it wasn&#x27;t until September - one week after the game&#x27;s arrival - that Bethesda finally committed to adding it in a future update.


At the time, the developer also pledged to introduce 32:9 ultrawide monitor support, a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, plus brightness and contrast controls; some of those features have already been implemented in previous updates, and at least a few more of the remaining ones will make it into next week&#x27;s update alongside DLSS support.

                              <span>With Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s early access exit right around the corner, developer Gameloft has detailed some of the new features it&#x27;ll be getting as part of its full release on 5th December and beyond - including a first look at its free multiplayer mode and the recently announced A Rift in Time paid story expansion.


Starting with the free stuff, Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s next content update launches 5th December to coincide with its full release, bringing the &quot;biggest amount of fixes and improvements so far&quot;, alongside the addition of The Nightmare Before Christmas&#x27; Jack Skellington as a new villager with his own friendship quests and rewards.


More significantly, it&#x27;ll introduce the multiplayer ValleyVerse feature, enabling friends to visit each other&#x27;s villages - where, alongside the usual activities, they&#x27;ll be able exchange items, visit Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s store (to take advantage of different stock), and more. Gameloft says it&#x27;ll be building on this initial multiplayer offering over time.

                              <span>Mysterious zombie MMO The Day Before will now launch on 7th December, developer Fntastic has said, and be released on Steam as an early access game initially priced $39.


The Day Before had been slated to arrive next week, on 10th November, following a rollercoaster ride to release in which Fntastic was forced to deny the game was simply a scam, and fight off a bizarre trademark dispute over the game&#x27;s name - which was contested by a calendar app.


Now, a fresh statement by Fntastic released this evening states The Day Before will arrive later than planned (again) and under the banner of Early Access. &quot;This is our first huge game, and there may be unforeseen consequences,&quot; Fntastic wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

                              <span>Apple has warned leaders of the opposition government in India that their phones are being spied on:
Multiple top leaders of India’s opposition parties and several journalists have received a notification from Apple, saying that “Apple believes you are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID ….”

AccessNow puts this in context:
For India to uphold fundamental rights, authorities must initiate an immediate independent inquiry, implement a ban on the use of rights-abusing commercial spyware, and make a commitment to reform the country’s surveillance laws. These latest warnings build on repeated instances of cyber intrusion and spyware usage, and highlights the surveillance impunity in India that continues to flourish despite the public outcry triggered by the ...</span>

This is the second interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different
subprojects. In this blog, we will cover the SIG Architecture: Production Readiness
subproject.
In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with Wojciech Tyczynski
(Google), lead of the Production Readiness subproject.
About SIG Architecture and the Production Readiness subproject
Frederico (FSM): Hello Wojciech, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you
got involved in Kubernetes?
Wojciech Tyczynski (WT): I started contributing to Kubernetes in January 2015. At that time,

Make It or Break It, as the new update is known, introduces a new Playgrounds mode where players can either muck around with the backyard featured in the story campaign or create one from the ground up, using an empty sandbox as a starting point.


Make It or Break It&#x27;s suite of tools promises a considerable amount of creative freedom. Players can craft buildings and fill them with furniture, place obstacles, spawn creatures and bosses, even trigger ambient sounds and music. Obsidian says the majority of the campaign&#x27;s assets - including art props, gameplay items, and harvestables, right down to individual blades of grass - will available for use, with no limit on the number of objects that can be placed.

Described as an &quot;escape-town&quot; experience, it traps players in a sequence of escape room challenges that gradually expand in size and difficulty from a single room to much larger areas.


All the while players will need to run from the Sanguivore - &quot;freakish abominations with a hunger for your flesh and blood&quot;. Yikes.

                              <span>Silent Hill: Ascension aired its first episode yesterday, but players are lambasting the game for its monetisation options and overwhelming UI.
Despite my personal apprehensions about Ascension, I thought I would keep an open mind about it. This morning, when I read discussions within the Silent Hill community on the game, I couldn&#x27;t quite believe what fans were reporting until I tried the game for myself.
Despite developer Genvid claiming players can get involved for free, there&#x27;s a pay-to-win model (as much as an interactive livestream can be pay-to-win) implemented here. A £20/$20 Founder&#x27;s Pack will get you the season pass (which is also priced at £20/$20 as listed on the game&#x27;s Apple App Store page), unlock all puzzles in the game, and exclusive emotes with throwbacks to older Silent Hill references. And an exclusive emote which says &quot;It&#x27;s trauma!&quot; in rainbow colouring.

As usual, the wave will include eight courses split into two new cups, taken from past games as well as mobile game Mario Kart Tour. Four new characters will also be added.

Each character has unique abilities as they explore 3D levels to take on Eggman, as always. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>The new voice of Wario - or at least, the person behind his grumpy moustachioed mouth in WarioWare: Move It! - looks to be Kevin Afghani, the actor also cast as the new voices of both Mario and Luigi.


It&#x27;s not a huge surprise to see Aghani taking on Wario as well, as this role was one of the four major Mario voices all performed by the legendary Charles Martinet, alongside Mario, Luigi and Waluigi. 


Afghani&#x27;s role as Wario looks to be confirmed within the WarioWare: Move It! credits, where he&#x27;s listed as the game&#x27;s principal performer. (In a typically oddball touch, we can also see his favourite food listed alongside his name: it&#x27;s sushi).

                              <span>Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has discussed the possibility of a fourth game in the series, and the idea of developing it as a more approachable prequel, similar to Yakuza 0.

Shenmue 3 was released in 2019, 18 years after the second game, but was aimed predominantly at fans of the series who backed the project on Kickstarter.


&quot;I want Shenmue 4 to be enjoyable for newcomers,&quot;  Suzuki said now, in an interview with IGN. &quot;To make that possible, the most important thing is to make it enjoyable without knowing previous events in the story. I don&#x27;t think that a new player wants to know 100 percent of the story. 20 or 30 percent could be enough.

Because of the shortened season length - believed to last only until the start of December - the game&#x27;s next battle pass will feature just 50 levels (half of the normal 100), leaks have revealed. 


The battle pass will be filled with character skins that are mash-ups of previous Fortnite favourites, such as Peely the banana man mixed up with ice cream mascot Lil&#x27; Whip - for a new skin named Lil&#x27; Split.

                              <span>Capcom says mods for its PC games can cause &quot;reputational damage&quot; thanks to content which causes offence to &quot;public order and morals&quot;, resulting in a blow to the games&#x27; (and presumably the company&#x27;s) images.

The statement was made during a recent presentation uploaded to Capcom&#x27;s research and development YouTube channel on anti-cheat and anti-piracy measures and how Capcom is tackling them in-house.

&quot;Mods are popular with users because they allow them to add or change various features to an existing game,&quot; Capcom said, admitting the &quot;majority of mods can have a positive impact&quot;. But some mods are seen as &quot;detrimental&quot; by the company in terms of &quot;reputational damage&quot; and workload.

However, Twitch is ending support for the app. From 6th November new users will no longer be able to download the app from the eShop. All users will then lose access from 31st January 2024.

Grant joined Ubisoft in April 2021 at a time she previously described as a &quot;misconduct crisis&quot; for the company, referring to the numerous allegations of sexual assault and harrassment made against senior and veteran employees including Splinter Cell and Far Cry creative director Maxime Béland and former editorial vice president Tommy François.

                              <span>Now that Paradox has, after much secrecy, revealed Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture developer The Chinese Room as the new developer on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the information floodgates are open, and the studio&#x27;s latest development update has unveiled a new fully voiced playable protagonist, Phyre.


As per The Chinese Room&#x27;s latest developer stream, Phyre is a somewhat pre-defined Elder vampire recently awoken after a 100-year slumber and slightly bewildered by modern-day Seattle. Phyre, for reasons initially unknown, carries a mysterious brand on their hand which is somehow connected to a voice in their head - belonging to a modern vampire known as Fabien - who&#x27;s bound to them, serving as an ever-present companion as the adventure continues.


While Phyre&#x27;s loose backstory might already be in place, there&#x27;s some flexibility as to how they present in-game, with players able to choose their gender, clothing, and clan.

                              <span>Rollerdrome, the acclaimed (and ridiculously stylish) skater shooter from OlliOlli developer Roll7, is launching for Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on 28th November.


Rollerdrome, which debuted on PC and PlayStation toward the end of last year, is set in the far-flung future of seven years from now, where, in a world ruled by corporations, the public is kept placated by a brutal blood sport known, as, yes, Rollerdrome.


Thrust into this dystopian set-up, players, in the role of Kara Hasson, don rollerskates and raise weapons - specifically, dual pistols, a grenade launcher, shotgun, and eventually, a laser-crossbow - for some high-speed third-person shooting action, where performing tricks restores ammo and bullet-time-style slo-mo can be deployed for greater success against opponents.

                              <span>Yesterday&#x27;s layoffs at Destiny 2 developer Bungie reportedly impacted 100 employees - approximately 8% of its 1,200-strong workforce - and occurred just weeks after management warned staff that revenue for the year was running significantly below expectations.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which reports Bungie employees were issued &quot;dire management warnings&quot; that revenue was 45 percent below projections just two weeks ago. The slump is said to be the result of a &quot;sharp drop&quot; in the popularity of Destiny 2, with Bungie CEO Pete Parsons having reportedly highlighted weak player retention at the time.


In that same meeting, according to Bloomberg sources in attendance, Parsons told employees that Destiny 2&#x27;s next expansion, The Final Shape - which concludes the game&#x27;s current Light and Darkness saga - was only getting &quot;good&quot; rather than &quot;great&quot; feedback. As such, management was planning to delay its release to improve the product.

                              <span>Atari has entered into an agreement to acquire Digital Eclipse, the retro-focused studio behind the likes of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration and this year&#x27;s The Making of Karateka.


Digital Eclipse has existed in a number of forms since its founding in 1992. In its original guise, it specialised in porting arcade games over to the likes of Game Boy Colour and PlayStation; that emulation work has continued in the years since despite organisational changes, first as it become Backbone Entertainment following a merger in 2003, and again after the Digital Eclipse brand was purchased and revived by former employees in 2015.


In more recent times, the studio&#x27;s emulation work has included the Blizzard Arcade Collection, Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, but last year&#x27;s interactive digital documentary Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - which blended new video interviews, archival material, and playable games to form an exhaustive record of Atari&#x27;s history - was particularly well-recieved. The studio then launched its Gold Master Series earlier this year, taking a similarly thorough approach to individual classic games, starting with the acclaimed The Making of Karateka.

                              <span>A new report from the Carbon Trust, a UK-founded global consultancy which aims to drive positive climate change in businesses, has outlined best practice for the games industry to calculate its carbon emissions.


The report, in support of the Playing for the Planet alliance, was conducted with 10 video game companies over 12 months to explore their approaches to carbon accounting. It found the majority of emissions are either in goods and services (such as data centres) or energy used by video game products.


In addition to the guidelines for the industry, the report also includes steps the public can take to reduce the carbon impact of playing.

To mark the ever marching hands of time, and I suppose the occasion, the team at Double Fine has shared some special fan creations including cosplays and artwork. 


&quot;Our team got together with our community and made this amazing tribute filled with stories, art, and tattoos!&quot; Grim Fandango&#x27;s director Tim Schafer shared on X (formerly Twitter). &quot;Thank you to everyone who contributed and collected these beautiful memories! I&#x27;ll keep them next to where my heart used to be.&quot;

                              <span>Forthcoming team shooter The Finals has been criticised for using AI for its commentator voiceovers.


Developed by Embark Studios, comprising former DICE employees, it&#x27;s currently in open beta - as announced at the recent Xbox Partner Preview showcase.



As part of its arena battle style, it includes voiceover from two commentators, but these have been developed with AI drawing criticism from voice actors and designers alike.

Speaking with Comic Book about his upcoming comic Scrapper, conversation turned to the shooter series. Bleszinski said he could consult  on any ideas Microsoft may have for the series, and suggested it could get a &quot;little bit of a reboot, like God of War&quot; had in 2018. 


&quot;I&#x27;ve always said, Phil Spencer has my number,&quot; he told the publication. &quot;I&#x27;m happy to consult. Gears will always be near and dear to my heart.&quot;

The investment was announced as the university celebrates being the first institution in the UK to offer an esports degree programme. The programme has recently been redesigned &quot;in collaboration with students and industry&quot;, the university stated.  
The money will go towards creating a bespoke esports arena on the university&#x27;s Stoke-on-Trent campus, a studio with &quot;dedicated broadcast galleries&quot;, and equipment from Panasonic and EVS. Esports students will also have access to &quot;esports aethetics and theming&quot;. The facilities are expected to be finished by spring 2024.

NES games Devil World and The Mysterious Murusame Castle are now available to play, while Castlevania Legends has been added to the selection of Game Boy titles.
Devil World is a maze game similar to Pac-Man but with a religious twist. You play as a green dragon who decides to take on the devil and must collect crucifixes and Bibles to gain the ability to breathe fire, eventually chasing the devil through a number of different mazes. The re-release of Devil World on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console was alright by our book.

                              <span>Ubisoft is &quot;decommissioning&quot; online services for a further 10 of its &quot;older&quot; titles, with the likes of Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2, Splinter Cell: Conviction, and Trials Evolution all affected.


&quot;Decommissioning the online services for older games is something we do not take lightly,&quot; the publisher wrote in a post on its support site. &quot;however, it is also a necessity as the technology behind these services becomes outdated.&quot;


In total, 10 games will see their online services yanked as of 25th January next year. On PC, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Revelations, Ghost Recon Future Solider, Heroes of Might and Magic 4, NCSI, RUSE, and Trials Evolution will all be affected. Online services will also be decommissioned for Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2 and Spinter Cell: Conviction on Xbox 360, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Liberation HD (Xbox 360 and PS3), plus Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood (Mac).

According to a report by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, citing &quot;people with knowledge of the matter&quot;, Destiny 2&#x27;s The Final Shape expansion - which is set to conclude the game&#x27;s Light and Darkness saga - will now launch in June next year. Bungie publicly announced a 27th February 2024 launch for the expansion back in August.


As for Marathon - a PvP reimagining of Bungie&#x27;s classic 90s FPS series, which was revealed in May - that has yet to be given an official release date. However, Bloomberg says this has now been moved into 2025, suggesting the studio was previously targeting a launch next year.

                              <span>Little Nightmares 3 might still be some way off - it&#x27;s due to arrive in 2024 - but, in the spirit of this spookiest of seasons, Bandai Namco has shared 18 minutes of co-op gameplay.


Announced back in August, Little Nightmares 3 marks the first time a mainline entry in the series won&#x27;t be handled by original developer Tarsier Studios. Instead, Supermassive Games - the team behind The Dark Pictures Anthology and Until Dawn - is at the helm, taking players on an adventure following two new protagonists.


Our spooky new pals are Low and Alone, both trapped in a world known as the Spiral - a &quot;cluster of disturbing places&quot; that includes the sandy Necropolis, home to a monolithic (and far from friendly) creature known as Monster Baby. An extensive look at the Necropolis and its perils can be found in the new gameplay trailer below.

                              <span>The Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s movie adaptation from Universal and Blumhouse has seen some impressive numbers following its release, breaking several records in the process.


The live-action adaptation of Scott Cawthon&#x27;s video game series, which stars The Hunger Games&#x27; Josh Hutcherson as troubled security Mike Schmidt, made its box office debut last week and has earned $78m in North America and $130m globally since then. 


As noted by Variety, this makes the movie the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US, coming only behind that of Nintendo and Illumination&#x27;s animated Super Mario Bros. Movie, which made $146.3 million.

Square describes the game as a &quot;GPS action RPG&quot; featuring new characters and a new story within the Kingdom Hearts universe.
The developer hasn&#x27;t revealed much else about the game, though from the trailer gameplay looks to be split between open-world exploration and battles against Heartless enemies.

                              <span>A design filed by Nintendo has been found and shared online that shows a dual-screen gaming device that can be split in two. 


This filing was made in November of last year, but was made public earlier this month. As shared on World Intellectual Property Organisation (via ResetEra), images of this device show a handheld apparatus, not too dissimilar to that of a Nintendo 3DS. Unlike the 3DS, however, this device can be split in half to allow for wireless gaming between two players.


It appears to be a handheld machine only, with no hybrid capabilities. Additionally, the top screen can face out. This is even when the device is closed. I can only assume if this product was to ever be realised, Nintendo would advise we all get some kind of case to go with it to protect the screens

In an interview with PC Gamer, the Counter-Strike 2 dev team – seemingly responding as a team and not as individual developers – said that whilst it had worked hard to ensure CS:GO players could transfer their skins and cosmetics into CS2, it &quot;didn&#x27;t know enough&quot; about NFTs to contribute meaningfully to the web3 debate and claims that players could transfer their NFT cosmetics in the same way.

&quot;From the start of development, we knew that CS2 would ultimately replace CS:GO, and we wanted to ensure that players could keep as many of their CS:GO skills and items as possible,&quot; the CS2 dev team said. &quot;So, early into the process, we started the work to support all of the CS:GO weapons, stickers, agents, and music in CS2.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 creator, Sam Lake, has revealed that he&#x27;s always wanted to tell a &quot;crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy&quot;.

In an interview with GQ magazine, Lake admitted that whilst the development of cult horror game Alan Wake was difficult in the shadows of Max Payne – &quot;the curse of the second album&quot;, as Lake describes it – there are still other worlds outside of Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Control he would like to entertain us with. 

&quot;Would I ever do anything else?&quot; he asks. &quot;Yeah. I&#x27;m still thinking that I will. There will be a time when I retire. It&#x27;s just that… this has all been so engaging.&quot;

                              <span>Magic: The Gathering&#x27;s head designer, Mark Rosewater, has responded to criticism from fans who think he&#x27;s gone back on his word that MTG would be &quot;one cohesive game&quot; and refrain from introducing crossover promotions to the fan-favourite collectable card game.

The comments come after Wizards of the Coast recently revealed what new crossover expansions Magic: The Gathering fans can expect to see next year, including new sets based upon Final Fantasy, Fallout, and the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series.

Back in 2018, Rosewater was asked if WotC would ever &quot;consider licensing a different IP and creating different cards for it&quot;. In response, he said that the team thought it was &quot;important that Magic is one cohesive game and not a hodge podge of different things&quot;.

                              <span>The islands of Åland are an important tax hack:
Although Åland is part of the Republic of Finland, it has its own autonomous parliament. In areas where Åland has its own legislation, the group of islands essentially operates as an independent nation.

This allows Scandinavians to avoid the notoriously high alcohol taxes:
Åland is a member of the EU and its currency is the euro, but Åland’s relationship with the EU is regulated by way of a special protocol. In order to maintain the important sale of duty-free goods on ferries operating between Finland and Sweden, Åland is not part of the EU’s VAT area...</span>

                              <span>Dead Space 3 writer and co-producer Chuck Beaver says he would &quot;redo Dead Space 3 almost completely&quot; if given the chance. 

That&#x27;s according to an interview Beaver gave with the CaptainBribo podcast, in which he said that while he would &quot;keep the lore beat it&#x27;s predicated on&quot;, and &quot;keep the lore you find out&quot;, he would &quot;have Ellie there but in a different relationship [with Isaac] and redo the entire main story&quot;.

As transcribed by PCGN, Beaver talks with Bribo about how, if able to rewrite the third instalment of the terrifying sci-fi horror series, he would ensure the story focussed more tightly on protagonist Isaac Clarke, albeit retaining the co-op mechanic to illustrate how the two characters see the same things differently.

That&#x27;s according to u/Tobbelobben30, who and noted that the name Tobias Kleanthous was &quot;mentioned in the [GTA 6] leaks&quot;. After a little sleuthing, Tobbelobben discovered that Kleanthous worked at Rockstar between 2014 and late 2021, during which he specialised in AI/gameplay and animation. 

Interestingly, Kleanthous is also the lead inventor and author of a patent called System and Method for Virtual Character Locomotion, which they describe on their LinkedIn profile as &quot;regarding animated locomotion control based on some of the core technology&quot; they &quot;architected and implemented at Rockstar Games&quot;.

                              <span>Gran Turismo 7 producer Kaz Yamauchi has teased that &quot;a big update&quot; is coming next week. 

In the succinct post shared on Twitter/X – Yamauchi didn&#x27;t add anything else, I&#x27;m afraid – the producer also appended the now customary screenshot that shows off a selection of super-charged cars obscured in shadow. 

People more familiar with cars than I am are speculating that the seven cars coming in this &quot;big update&quot; are:

                              <span>Eagle-eyed fans reckon they&#x27;ve spotted evidence that &quot;some sort of&quot; Dragon Quest announcement could be on the way.

Square Enix producer and director, Yosuke Saito, took to Twitter/X yesterday to say they&#x27;d had a &quot;fun recording session&quot; at work, teasing that they&#x27;d tell us more once the news had been finalised and approved by the appropriate channels.

So far, so what, right? Well, the tweet was accompanied by a photo of Saito&#x27;s script, and whilst they&#x27;d obscured two blocks of text on the front page to hide the subject matter, a little of the text behind the front page was legible for those who can read Japanese… and it&#x27;s a name hidden in plain sight that has made Dragon Quest fans very, very excited.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 players have hit back at a new Halloween-themed DLC fatality that has a horrifying price tag: $10.

Players can pick up the gruesome jack-o-lantern animation for the princely sum of 1200 Dragon Krystals, a premium in-game currency that sports a current exchange rate of 1250 krystals for $10 USD.

To put that into context, Mortal Kombat 11&#x27;s Kombat Pack, whilst the preceding title in the series, featured several full DLC characters for just $20. But Mortal Kombat 1 wants the equivalent of $10 for that one fatality, even though it&#x27;s a premium game that costs at best £60 – or £85 if you forked out for the premium edition.

                              <span>Capcom is teasing a &quot;major unannounced title&quot; for 2024.

Although the developer/publisher has yet to even announce what the game is, according to Capcom&#x27;s recent investor&#x27;s report, a &quot;major title&quot; will be available on console and be released in the second half of this financial year – which ends in March 2024, of course.

As posted to Reddit&#x27;s Gaming Leaks and Rumours community, the report – which is currently only available in Japanese – makes two mentions of the mysterious title, including one that intimates that its release will help the megacorp realise its lofty goal of selling 45 million units on console.

                              <span>Red Barrels has dropped a terrifying new update for The Outlast Trials just in time for Halloween.

The update – which is available now – ushers in the new trial program Geister, as well as a brand new map based in, and around, someone&#x27;s deliciously sick vision of a courthouse. And blood – lots and lots of blood:

The Outlast Trials is out now in early access on both Steam and Epic Games Store. Set in the height of the Cold War era, players take on the role of test subjects abducted by the shady Murkoff Corporation, where they&#x27;ll be &quot;thrust into a series of physical and mental ordeals, tormented by iconic characters, and challenged alone or in teams to survive with their sanity intact&quot;.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios has issued a tongue-in-cheek correction to South Park after its latest episode featured a joke about the critically acclaimed RPG.

The episode, called &quot;South Park: Joining the Panderverse&quot;, sees Cartman live in an alternate reality wherein he curses the fact he can&#x27;t cross-save the 50 hours he&#x27;s invested into Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 across multiple universes.

Cartman – played by Janeisha Adams-Ginyard, just to sprinkle in a little extra confusion – asks, &quot;do save games not cross multiple universes?&quot;, to which Stan confirms: &quot;Save games don&#x27;t even cross between PCs and PS5s – why would they cross between multiple universes?&quot;

                              <span>Finnish clothing company Makia has teamed with Remedy to release a line of high-end unisex streetwear inspired by Alan Wake 2.

To celebrate the release of Remedy&#x27;s highly-anticipated sequel, the &quot;Cult Collection&quot; of clothing &quot;tells stories from darkness&quot; and features jackets, sweatshirts, tees, and a cap.

&quot;The unisex streetwear collection draws inspiration from the nightmarish world of Alan Wake and the enigmatic Cult of Tree featured in the sequel,&quot; the team explains on the official website. &quot;Characterised by the cult’s emblems and deer masks worn by the cultists, the collection evokes the eerie and unsettling feel of a small town with a big secret.&quot;

                              <span>With just over a week to go until this year&#x27;s BlizzCon - the show&#x27;s first in-person event since 2019 - Blizzard has shared a full broadcast schedule detailing everything that&#x27;ll be available to watch online as the two-day convention unfolds.


This year&#x27;s BlizzCon, which is being held at California&#x27;s Anaheim Convention Center, runs from Saturday, 3rd November to Sunday, 4th November; all panels due to take place at the BlizzCon Arena during that time will be streamed in their entirety via YouTube and Twitch for the benefit of fans unable to attend in-person.


In total, 11 panels will be broadcast over the course of the two-day event, with the most tantalising - aside from BlizzCon&#x27;s Opening Ceremony, which usually manages to pack in reveal or two (not always a good one, admittedly) - being the four offering a look at &quot;what&#x27;s next&quot;.

                              <span>Free-to-play battle royale shooter Apex Legends is finally introducing cross-progression as part of its 19th season, and ahead of its arrival next Tuesday, 31st October, developer Respawn Entertainment has detailed how the whole thing&#x27;ll work.


Cross-progression, once launched, will enable players to access their progression data, cosmetics, and currency via a single EA account across all platforms. Crucially, the cross-progression migration process is both automatic and mandatory, meaning there&#x27;s a fair amount those who play across multiple platforms will likely want to know in preparation.


For starters, players who&#x27;ve accrued different progress levels across multiple platforms will soon have all that smushed together into a single account. Respawn will generate the stats of this new account based on what it&#x27;s calling a player&#x27;s &quot;primarily platform&quot; - that is, the one with the highest level reached across all platforms. Stats/progress of all other accounts will be lost.

                              <span>Arizona Sunshine 2, the sequel to developer Vertigo Games&#x27; well-received 2016 VR zombie shooter, is coming to PlayStation VR 2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR on 7th December - and there&#x27;s a new gameplay trailer to accompany the news.


Vertigo&#x27;s sequel brings back the original game&#x27;s wise-cracking protagonist for another bout of sun-kissed (and optionally co-operative) zombie-slaying shooting action in the Arizona desert. This time, however, it&#x27;s promising to mix things up with the likes of enhanced &quot;next-gen VR environments&quot; and a &quot;new mutilation and gore system&quot;. And if you can&#x27;t make zombies&#x27; eyes pop out by kicking them up the arse, I&#x27;m sending it back.


There&#x27;s also talk of &quot;all-new and fan-favourite&quot; weapons - including the likes of shotguns, flamethrowers, crowbars, pickaxes, and machetes - but the absolute most critical new addition is Buddy. Yes, this time around, you get to mow down the zombies hordes alongside your own pet dog pal. And he&#x27;s not just there for the violence; described as the &quot;goodest boy to play a game of undead fetch with&quot;, he&#x27;ll also unearth key items and help carry gear.

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 has got off to a bit of a rough, with many players complaining of performance issues following this week&#x27;s launch on PC. But while publisher Paradox has been forthright in acknowledging these problems (even prior to launch, somewhat unconventionally), it now wants to make it absolutely clear that, no, technical issues aren&#x27;t because the game is trying to render the teeth of every single person in your city.


All this apparently started with a post on the Cities: Skylines subreddit in which one Hexcoder0 claimed the game was rendering individual teeth with no LOD (level of detail) adjustments, even when viewed from far away. They even threw together a bit of a collage feature a screenshot, a couple of character meshes, and, vitally, two red circles, to illustrate their claim.

 
Two days later, Paradox - presumably in some kind of damage limitation frenzy given the not exactly glittering reception the game has received - has responded by firing a statement out to press drawing attention to the &quot;bizarre story&quot; and denying Molargate is true.

                              <span>Popular licensed life sim Disney Dreamlight Valley will no longer transition to a free-to-play model when it drops its early access moniker. 


Developer Gameloft revealed today that its game would leave early access on 5th December but retain its early access price point (and indeed, it will also get pricier physical and special digital editions with extra currency and cosmetics bundled in).


On top of that, there&#x27;s word of a major new expansion to the game, which will also come with a $30 price tag. Disney Dreamlight Valley: A Rift In Time will introduce new biomes and yet more characters to the base game, and is set to be fully detailed in a video showcase to be broadcast next Wednesday, 1st November at 5pm UK time.

The first is named Night Springs, which Alan Wake fans will know is the name of the series&#x27; in-game TV show (based heavily on The Twilight Zone). 


&quot;Visions and dreams,&quot; Remedy teases of what fans should expect here. &quot;Fiction is written and coming true. Fiction collapses and remains just words on a page. These are those stories... in Night Springs.&quot;

PlayStation&#x27;s rosy outlook is also boosted by the release of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, PlayStation exec Eric Lempel told Barron&#x27;s (via ResetEra).
Lempel said Sony had been hampered by supply chain issues caused by the Covid pandemic and Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, which in turn caused a components shortage for PS5 production.

Best of all, perhaps, there are collectable hats for your turnip, and multiple endings based on how much tax you managed to evade.

Booth&#x27;s departure had been discussed earlier this week by outspoken former game director David Jaffe, another PlayStation alumnus.


In a further video published yesterday, Jaffe alleged that Booth had been fired amidst longer-term internal tensions around PlayStation studios moving to develop more live service games.

                              <span>So you thought developer Rocksteady was done with Batman: Arkham Knight, did you? Well, it seems that might not be quite the case. Eight years after its initial release, Rocksteady&#x27;s third entry in the Arkham series has been updated to add an unexpected bit of new content - but it appears the celebrations might have been a bit premature.


Earlier today, Batman fans began reporting the Epic Games Store version of 2015&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Knight had received an update specifically adding Robert Pattinson&#x27;s Batsuit, from last year&#x27;s movie reboot, as a wearable skin.


It was a bit of an odd discovery for all sorts of reasons, not least because neither Rocksteady nor publisher Warner Bros. announced or acknowledged its arrival. The Pattsuit&#x27;s apparent Epic Games Store exclusivity also seemed like a bit of a strange choice too, and the mystery only deepened when the suit reportedly vanished not long after word of its release began to spread.

                              <span>Valve has officially released its long-awaited SteamVR 2.0 update, which - among other things - overhauls the Steam store experience in VR as part of an &quot;ongoing effort to better unify the Steam ecosystem for all users, providing a more consistent experience across devices&quot;.


SteamVR 2.0 was confirmed to be in the works all the way back in 2019, but it wasn&#x27;t until its surprise re-emergence last month that it started finding its way into users&#x27; hands - initially as part of a short beta designed to iron out any major wrinkles ahead of a general release.


And that official launch has now arrived, with the update bringing the likes of an overhauled VR storefront that&#x27;ll make new and popular VR games easier to find, alongside the majority of features introduced as part of Steam&#x27;s Steam-Deck-inspired Big Picture redesign.

                              <span>Microsoft has started rolling out October&#x27;s Xbox system update to all users, with this latest release introducing the previously announced ability to remap keyboard keys to Xbox controller buttons, alongside a number of other features.


Microsoft confirmed the new accessibility feature was undergoing Insider testing earlier this month, explaining its introduction would enable users to remap almost 90 keyboard keys - or combinations of keys - to any button on the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2. This would, for instance, make it possible for players with limited mobility to use the Xbox Adaptive Controller with games ordinarily only supporting mouse/keyboard.


Keyboard mapping for Xbox controllers will be available through the Xbox Accessories app on PC and console once October&#x27;s update has been installed.

                              <span>Fascinating story of a covert wiretap that was discovered because of an expired TLS certificate:
The suspected man-in-the-middle attack was identified when the administrator of jabber.ru, the largest Russian XMPP service, received a notification that one of the servers’ certificates had expired.
However, jabber.ru found no expired certificates on the server, ­ as explained in a blog post by ValdikSS, a pseudonymous anti-censorship researcher based in Russia who collaborated on the investigation.
The expired certificate was instead discovered on a single port being used by the service to establish an encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection with users. Before it had expired, it would have allowed someone to decrypt the traffic being exchanged over the service...</span>

                              <span>As part of its latest earnings report - for the first half of its fiscal year 2023-24 - Ubisoft has announced yet another delay for Skull and Bones, with the beleaguered pirate adventure now expected to arrive sometime in the first few months of 2024.


Skull and Bones has been in development since 2013, but the game has seen repeated delays following its official unveiling in 2017. Most recently, Ubisoft shifted the game&#x27;s release from this March to an unspecified &quot;early&quot; point in its fiscal year 2023-24 in order to create a &quot;much more polished and balanced experience and to build awareness&quot;.


Skull and Bones has received a closed beta since then, but word on a revised release date has remained conspicuously absent - and Ubisoft has now announced a delay into Q4 of its current financial year, meaning it&#x27;s expected to arrive sometime within the January-March 2024 period. No reason was provided for this latest delay.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced a reorganisation of its Xbox leadership team, bringing closer integration with Bethesda and parent company ZeniMax. 


In an internal memo sent to staff today, published by The Verge, Spencer described the changes as being part of an effort to make an &quot;expanded content organisation - one that enables Xbox Game Studios and ZeniMax&#x27;s development studios to collaborate effectively together... to do their best work in growing our portfolio of games players love&quot;. 


Matt Booty, previously known as Head of Xbox Game Studios, will now lead this expanded organisation with a new job title: President, Game Content and Studios.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss this week&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview showcase, which featured around a dozen intriguing titles coming to Microsoft&#x27;s console in the near-ish future.
Tomorrow&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 got a final airing and it looks just as creepy as we&#x27;d have hoped. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth has an Animal Crossing mode, and Liv in particular is delighted. Oh and Still Wakes The Deep - the spooky game from Everybody&#x27;s Gone To The Rapture set on a Scottish oil rig, looks great. 
Opinion is a little more mixed on Metal Gear Solid Green Triangle: Snake Eater, with the visual style critiqued by some quarters of the internet today. Joining me to discuss the rest are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

The crossover was initially teased last month, when FuturLab co-CEO Kirsty Rigden called Back to the Future a &quot;dream IP&quot; for the developer.
Players will get to scrub up iconic vehicles and buildings from the film series, including the Time Machine, Doc&#x27;s van, Hill Valley Clock Tower, the Holomax Theatre, and Doc&#x27;s Time Train.

                              <span>Apex Legends: Ignite, the 19th season of the ever-popular battle royale, will explode onto our screens with the brand new Legend Conduit next Tuesday, 31st October. The massive in-game storm at Storm Point has now cleared the map and things look a little different to how we remember it, meaning there&#x27;s plenty of new areas to explore as you fight to survive.
First off, let&#x27;s talk about brand new Legend Conduit. We now know more about her abilities, as well as how she came to get her equipment and suit. Conduit began as a fan of Apex Legends and is now stoked to be part of the Apex Games themselves - but she didn&#x27;t join just for fame or fun, as she&#x27;s got a family to take care of. She&#x27;s described as having a good sense of humour and being fascinated with the tech used in the games.
An interesting fact for any Titanfall fans is that Conduit uses a radioactive battery from a modified Monarch Titan to power her suit and gadgets. She went exploring on a highly-radiated battlefield and came across the battery. She then stole it and uses it to take her place in the Apex Games - but at a cost. The battery itself is poisoning Conduit, and though we&#x27;re not sure how this will impact her story as we move ahead, we&#x27;re a bit worried about her long-term chances.

That&#x27;s alongside the usual in-game content for other titles including Cyberpunk 2077, Pokémon Go, and Diablo 4.

One major mobile game publisher is said to have met with Unity&#x27;s John Riccitiello after the policy announcement and said: &quot;Fuck you, we&#x27;re not paying&quot;.


The report comes from MobileGamer.Biz, with anonymous sources from inside Unity providing fresh details.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy will add a New Game Plus mode to the game after it launches, which will add a harder difficulty mode and a new &quot;alternative narrative&quot;.


The new difficulty is named Nightmare, which I can only imagine will be incredibly challenging. When I got to play some of Alan Wake 2 earlier this year I explored two chapters on Normal mode and I died a lot. And then I died again.


On the plus side, players will still have all their previously unlocked weapons and upgrades to hand when they return to the game, as this is all retained in Alan Wake 2&#x27;s New Game Plus.

The remake - Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater to use its official name - is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and this new trailer showed Snake sneaking around a beautifully lit jungle and a cute little frog paddling through some very realistic water.


It&#x27;s technically impressive, but for some fans it&#x27;s lost the art style of the original game.

                              <span>At Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview showcase last night, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth kicked proceedings off with a new trailer revealing one of the new side hustles.


Dondoko Island will let players escape to a deserted island off the coast of Hawaii, a &quot;vacation within a vacation, where a cosy DIY lifestyle awaits&quot;. There&#x27;s fishing, material gathering, furniture crafting, and even decora- hold on...


RGG Studio has essentially added Animal Crossing into the Like a Dragon (previously called Yakuza) series, but with the usual exaggerated wackiness the franchise has become known for. And I could not be more excited for it.

                              <span>It looks like Diablo 4&#x27;s first major expansion will be called Lord of Hatred, and focus on Prime Evil Mephisto.


That&#x27;s according to dataminers who have tapped into Blizzard&#x27;s Technical Alpha build of version 2.0 on its private testing branch (thanks WccfTech).



In addition, it&#x27;s believed the Kurast region from Diablo 2 will also be added - a city that fell to Mephisto&#x27;s corruption.

In a new blog post, the developer said it wants to assure players that its previously announced big patch, which promised more than 200 QoL-improvements across platforms, is still a main priority for the team. 


As is its general &quot;patching process&quot; for Payday 3, with the developer saying the goal is to ensure future game updates will be released &quot;at a steady cadence&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo has announced that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is Europe&#x27;s fastest-selling Super Mario game ever.


The company announced the statistic today on social media, though did not provide any concrete sales figures. We&#x27;ll likely get those as part of a global sales update, or financial statement.


Regardless, it&#x27;s a positive sign things have gone well for Elephant Mario and his warp pipe-stuffing chums - even if Nintendo&#x27;s mascot couldn&#x27;t quite beat Spider-Man 2 in the UK&#x27;s boxed game chart on Monday.

Tonight&#x27;s latest instalment was a pretty decent offering all-round, that, while perhaps not exciting as such, did at least have some interesting reveals. There was first footage of Konami&#x27;s Metal Gear Sold 3 remake, a new game from PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab, and more. And if you&#x27;re looking for a summary of it all that won&#x27;t take up 30 minutes of your time, then read on.


First up, we learned Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will continue the series&#x27; tradition of extravagant side activities when it releases on 26th January next year, giving players the opportunity to manage an entire tropical island resort in pure Animal Crossing fashion. There&#x27;s fishing, bug catching, crafting, and a whole lot more as detailed in the trailer below.


PowerWash simulator developer FuturLab unveiled its new game Ikaro: Will Not Die, a  spiritual successor to the studio&#x27;s acclaimed Velocity series that promises &quot;satisfying flow-state&quot; rogue-lite action that you can read more about elsewhere.

Well, would you believe it, there&#x27;s a game just for you; it&#x27;s called Still Wakes the Deep and first gameplay has just debuted.


Announced back in June, Still Wakes the Deep is the latest from developer The Chinese Room - previously responsible for the likes of Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Dear Esther - whisking players to the Beira D oil rig off the Scottish coast circa 1975.


What follows is a narrative-focused first-person horror adventure in which players, in the role of an off-shore oil rig worker suddenly cut off from the outside world, must &quot;run, climb, and swim through the flooding corridors and storm-lashed outer decks&quot; as they attempt to evade an unspeakable otherworldly forces that&#x27;s invited itself onboard.

                              <span>FuturLab, the developer behind nozzle-tweaking masterwork PowerWash Simulator, has unveiled neon-streaked action-adventure Ikaro: Will Not Die, which the studio describes a spiritual successor to its acclaimed Velocity series.


Velocity, for the uninitiated, began life as twitchy shoot-&#x27;em-up in which players piloted their ship (known as the Quarp Jet) through space in a blaze of enemy-shredded bullets. Its sequel, 2014&#x27;s Velocity 2X, retained the acclaimed ship-bound action of the original, but paired it with regular on-foot sections requiring protagonist to Lieutenant Kai Tana to disembark and solve a few puzzles to clear the way forward. Eurogamer liked it a lot!


But back to Ikaro: Will Not Die; it&#x27;s being billed as an action-adventure rogue-lite, that &quot;brings the pace and precision of [the Velocity series&#x27;] satisfying flow-state action into third-person, while infusing an array of exciting new systems and mechanics.&quot;

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended - the Unreal Engine 5 remake of dino-survival hit Ark: Survival Evolved - is surprise-launching onto PC today, 25th October. However, developer Wildcard has announced a further delay for the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions, with both now due to arrive some time in November.


There has, of course, been a fair bit of controversy surrounding Ark: Survival Ascended since its announcement back in April this year; its reveal came with the news that Wildcard would be taking Ark: Survival Evolved&#x27;s official servers offline when the remake arrived, forcing players to upgrade to the new version if they wanted to stay put. 


It didn&#x27;t help, either, that the remake was initially only available as part of a bundle with the now-delayed Ark 2, and while Wildcard eventually scrapped those plans, it instead decided to release a standalone version of Ark: Survival Ascended that was - amazingly - exactly the same price as the original bundle, despite featuring one less game. However, that price recently fell by $5 to $44.99 after Wildcard reversed plans to include a remake of Ark&#x27;s Scorched Earth expansion alongside the base map, which it said would no longer be ready for launch.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting fresh news on Konami&#x27;s Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake (or perhaps apprehensively awaiting, given how things are going elsewhere), you&#x27;re in luck: first gameplay has now been shared as part of the latest Xbox Partner Preview showcase.


Announced back in May, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater (as the remake is officially known) retains 2004 original&#x27;s story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear - as well as its voice cast.


Beyond that, Konami is promising a variety of modern-day upgrades, including improved visuals - the remake is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 - as well as evolved gameplay and a &quot;seamless user experience&quot;, whatever that means.

that can help you migrate from Ingress to Gateway
API. Gateway API is just weeks away from graduating to GA, if you

In the ever-evolving world of Kubernetes, networking plays a pivotal role. As more applications are

                              <span>Frictional Games is celebrating the spooky season with a free update for its acclaimed WW1 horror Amensia: The Bunker, designed to make the already traumatic experience even more terrifying. And if your nerves are up to the challenge, the Halloween Update launches today.


Frictional&#x27;s creative lead Fredrik Olsson began teasing a hardcore Shell Shock mode last month, detailing a few of the sadistic features it would bring, but with it now here as part of today&#x27;s Halloween Update, the studio has provided a little more information on what&#x27;s in store.


For starters, as previously confirmed, The Bunker&#x27;s Admin Office will no longer be the safe haven it once was in Shell Shock mode; its reassuringly sturdy steel doors are replaced with wood, meaning, yes, the monster can get in. And speaking of that pursuing horror, Shell Shock mode gives it new behaviours designed to increase its unpredictability.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has released a new short animation in which Detective Pikachu investigates who stole a flan from his human sidekick&#x27;s fridge.
While it&#x27;s not quite the Detective Pikachu film sequel we and lead actor Justice Smith may be hoping for, it&#x27;s a cute, six-minute video full of detective clichés and adorable Pokémon.
Detective Pikachu begins his daily routine with a strong cup of coffee and a flick through the morning paper, filming his activities for his social media presence (even Pikachu isn&#x27;t immune to becoming an influencer, I guess). Tim joins him for breakfast, only to find his flan has been taken from the fridge, so the pair get to work to figure out who took it. You can watch the video on YouTube to see who-dun-it.

The Wakandan Embassy is included as an Easter Egg in the game and if Miles Morales stands outside, a prompt appears to perform the iconic salute.


When Peter does the same, there&#x27;s no such prompt.

Publisher Paradox Interactive previously admitted the game had &quot;not achieved the [performance] benchmark&quot; it wanted. Despite that, the sequel reached a concurrent peak of 104,697 players, surpassing the original&#x27;s record of 60,386 concurrent players (as recorded by SteamDB).
Steam reviews for Cities: Skylines 2 are mixed however, mostly with criticisms levelled at the game&#x27;s performance and some players are questioning Paradox&#x27;s decision to release the game even if it believes &quot;releasing now is the best way forward&quot;.

Payday 3&#x27;s released was marred by server issues which left players unable to access the game during its launch weekend, something which developer Starbreeze blamed on a third-party matchmaking service.
While these issues have been resolved, players are still finding other problems with the game technically, and with its UI, progression, and its always-online requirement. Many Payday 3 Steam reviews compare the game to 2013&#x27;s Payday 2, calling 2 a superior experience and suggesting others are better off playing that instead. Which is exactly what Payday fans look to be doing.

                              <span>Counter-Strike 2 players are being banned for moving their mouse too quickly.


The game uses the Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) System to identify when cheats or hacks are being used and will issue an immediate ban for bot-like behaviour.


That includes spinning around too quickly, which is all to do with your DPI.

                              <span>Bethesda and Todd Howard announced Elder Scrolls 6 when they did because of fan demand, or in the words of Skyrim&#x27;s lead designer Bruce Nesmith, because &quot;the pitchforks and torches were out&quot;.


Nesmith, who has been part of Bethesda Softworks on and briefly off since the 90s and has worked on Skyrim, the Fallout series and Starfield, said the studio took &quot;years of hits for not talking about Elder Scrolls 6&quot; publicly. 


&quot;I mean, years of hits,&quot; Nesmith said in an interview with MinnMax. &quot;Because Todd&#x27;s opinion - one which I share, by the way - is that the video game industry has short memories. Those companies that start touting their games years ahead of time, actually, you know, they screw themselves. The best time to start talking about it is six months before release.&quot; This was the strategy the studio implemented for Fallout 4.

                              <span>Konami&#x27;s new Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 only launched yesterday, but already there&#x27;s a mod to boost its versions of Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 up to 4K. 


Fans were left disappointed by the base game only offering 720p resolution on PC for these games - following earlier confusion in which Konami initially stated all games would &quot;target&quot; 1080p on all platforms other than Nintendo Switch. 


In response, a fan has speedily released the MGSResolutionPatch PC mod, just hours after the game launched on Steam (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Microsoft has detailed its earnings for the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, pointing to a record-breaking Q1 for Xbox gaming revenue, despite a 7% drop in hardware sales.


Over the course of Microsoft&#x27;s Q1 2024, which covers 1st July to 30th September, Xbox generated $3.9bn USD in gaming revenue - equating to a 9% year-on-year increase - which the company attributed to strong performance from first-party titles and Game Pass.


Not coincidentally, Xbox&#x27;s record-breaking Q1 encompassed the long-awaited launch of Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield, which surpassed 10m players within its first few weeks of release - and in an investor call following today&#x27;s fiscal report, Microsoft CEO Satyda Nadella confirmed the game provided a significant boost for Game Pass, setting the record at launch for the &quot;most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever&quot; (as per The Verge&#x27;s Tom Warren).

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive has published some very, very good games since its formation in 2016, and 12 of those titles will soon be bundled onto a single Switch cartridge. The only catch - and it&#x27;s admittedly quite a big one - is that it&#x27;ll cost a whopping $200.


The region-free Annapurna Interactive Deluxe Limited Edition Collection, as the mega-priced cartridge is officially known, is being released in collaboration with video game collectibles company iam8bit and - as per the &quot;limited edition&quot; bit - is restricted to 2,500 copies.


For your hard-earned $199.99 USD (plus, of course, a hefty chunk of VAT and import fees if you&#x27;re ordering from the UK), you&#x27;ll get a cartridge containing Donut County, Gorogoa, Hindsight, I Am Dead, If Found..., Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition, Neon White, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Solar Ash, The Artful Escape, The Pathless, and What Remains of Edith Finch. That is, then, some top-notch gaming in a single square inch (or thereabouts) of plastic.

                              <span>Nintendo has released strict new guidelines for the smaller-scale competitive tournament scene, outlining exactly what it will permit - with caps on everything from competitor numbers to ticket prices - before organisers must apply for an official license from the company.


As detailed in its new Community Tournament Guidelines - which were initially published by Nintendo of Japan before appearing in locally adjusted form on Nintendo of Europe&#x27;s website earlier today - tournaments will be permitted to continue without a license after 15th November this year, provided they are &quot;small-scale and not for commercial profit&quot;.


More specifically, these strictly limited events - which Nintendo is terming &quot;community tournaments&quot; - may not have more than 200 participants a day when held in-person, increasing to 300 daily participants for online tournaments. Additionally, money raised through spectator tickets and entry fees, capped at £18/€20 and £14/€15 a person respectively, must not exceed the costs of organising the tournament and raising prize money - although prize money (limited to a total of £4,500/€5,000) also cannot be generated from spectator ticket sales.

                              <span>Nightdive Studios&#x27; remaster of cult hit shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces has been given a release date and is launching for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 28th February next year.


Announced back in August, the Star Wars: Dark Forces remaster is being made in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, and sees the 1995 first-person shooter - which follows mercenary Kyle Katarn as he undertakes a number of covert operations to thwart the Empire at the behest of the Rebel Alliance - getting a welcome modern-day upgrade.


Nightdive Studios - the remaster specialist behind this year&#x27;s acclaimed System Shock update, among many others - is promising resolutions of up to 4K at 120fps for its enhanced Dark Forces release, although expect that to vary depending on your platform of choice.

That means streaming simultaneously on Twitch as well as competitor platforms like YouTube and Kick.


It&#x27;s a move that will help streamers grow their viewership both on and off the platform, even while Twitch develops further tools to aid with growth like the recent Discovery Feed and Stories.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 launches today, and fans have already found references to the games they expect to be featured in Konami&#x27;s still-to-be-announced Vol 2. 


As a reminder, this initial collection is centred around MGS1, 2 and 3. But back in June,  Konami&#x27;s website appeared to suggest a future Vol 2 would continue by including MGS4, 5 and Peace Walker.


Now Vol 1 is released, that&#x27;s exactly what the game&#x27;s own files also suggest - via references to all three of those games spotted in its code by fans on reddit. Konami is yet to confirm Vol 2, of course, but its contents now seem fairly certain. (Sorry, Twin Snakes fans.)

                              <span>Suika, also known as Watermelon Game, released globally last week, and a new update has added English language support.
If you&#x27;ve not heard of Suika already, think of it a casual game which plays a bit like 2048 or Threes. Instead of numbers, however, you combine round fruits within a set amount of space. The aim is to make a massive watermelon (which is pronounced suika in Japanese).
The game was first released in Japan on Switch in December 2021 and has since sold over 2m copies. There&#x27;s also a free browser version you can try.

                              <span>A demo has been released for retro survival horror game Crow Country.


From the developer behind Snipperclips and Tangle Tower, this is quite the change of pace.


Its aesthetic is part Final Fantasy 7 and part Resident Evil 1, with polygonal characters, 3D environments reminiscent of pre-rendered backgrounds, and classic survival horror gameplay. Check it out in the trailer below.

                              <span>A modder has created a tool which takes assets from Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas and makes them compatible with Fallout 4&#x27;s Creation Engine.
Yes, I&#x27;m one of those Fallout: New Vegas fans who wishes we could get a shinier, updated version of the game. And I&#x27;m one step closer to that dream thanks to bololo11&#x27;s FNV to FO4 mod.
The script can convert most models and plugins from both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, as well as the base game of New Vegas, from their native game engine of Gamebryo. bololo11 states the mod can&#x27;t convert NPCs and creatures, quests or scripts &quot;yet&quot;, and converted weapons and armour can&#x27;t be equipped, but it&#x27;s a great start.

&quot;Media Molecule has made significant strategic changes during the past year, including shifting our focus from Dreams to our new project,&quot; reads a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter. 
&quot;We have had to make the difficult decision to begin the consultation process for team members within certain departments of the studio. This is a tough moment for the individuals impacted and the studio overall.

                              <span>A drink driving game which was available on the Nintendo Switch eShop has been pulled from sale, after it initially used a PEGI 3+ rating.

Need for Spirit Drink &amp; Drive Simulator was released for the Switch on 15th October, and contains gameplay of a &quot;hapless professional driver tasked with delivering alcoholic beverages to various celebrations, all while battling the perils of abysmal roads and your very own addiction to the booze you&#x27;re transporting&quot;.

With &quot;immersive camera modes&quot; and an added &quot;exciting twist&quot; of drunk vision, the game is (yes) a drink driving simulator. Its PEGI 3+ rating suggests the game is suitable for all age groups. PEGI however states a game which &quot;refers to or depicts the use of illegal drugs, alcohol or tobacco&quot; must be labelled as PEGI 16 or PEGI 18.

As reported back in June, players have been seeking a secret cow level in the game, something that began as an urban myth in the original Diablo but was acknowledged by Blizzard in later games.


Blizzard has so far denied the existence of a cow level in Diablo 4, with general manager Rod Fergusson telling Kinda Funny the development team &quot;wanted to ground [Diablo 4] as much as possible&quot;. That hasn&#x27;t stopped players searching for it, however.

Last month, Respawn fixed matchmaking in the game, all while adding hidden references to the release dates of Titanfall, Titanfall2, and Apex Legends.
The evidence of a planned surprise for players has grown bigger, and fans now believe the studio will have some news for the Titanfall series on 28th October to mark seven years since the release of Titanfall 2.

Action against the group began on 16th October with the arrest of a &quot;key target&quot; in Paris, prompting a search of his Czechia home.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve somehow missed out on developer Dennaton Games&#x27; classic Hotline Miami series - or are just looking for another excuse to revisit its woozily eccentric mayhem - you might like to know both games are now natively available for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.


It has, somewhat unbelievably, been over a decade since the critically lauded Hotline Miami first dropped jaws and quickened pulses with its breathless, blood-soaked top-down ode to violence, in which the game&#x27;s unnamed protagonist rampages against the local Miami mafia after receiving cryptic instructions on his answering machine.


Its grisly blend of stealth and ultra-gory shooting action - augmented by a surreal narrative, a stylish fever-dream aesthetic, and an absolute stunner of a pulsing synth soundtrack - immediately won it fans (Eurogamer awarded it 10/10 at the time of its release). 2015&#x27;s Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number went bigger, weirder, and tougher in almost every conceievable way, but didn&#x27;t have quite the same impact the second time around.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s occasional Xbox Partner Preview series returns this Wednesday, 25th October, with another digital showcase of gameplay and trailers.


As usual, the Xbox Partner Preview will focus exclusively on third-party offerings - ranging from indie games to &quot;familiar favourites&quot;, as per Microsoft&#x27;s announcement - with proceedings set to begin this Wednesday at 6pm BST/1pm ET.


As to what will be shown, Microsoft has already confirmed appearances from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Studio Wildcard&#x27;s Ark: Survival Ascended (which will be airing first gameplay), Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 (expect a &quot;launch trailer for this one), and a fresh look at Dungeons of Hinterberg.

                              <span>The developers of the latest King Kong game say they were given just one year to build the game from scratch, with the harsh timeline mandated by publisher GameMill Entertainment.


Last week, Skull Island: Rise of Kong released on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and Xbox with little marketing fanfare, but garnered attention for its poor quality, especially for a game for a licensed franchise.


In a new report from The Verge, developers from IguanaBee say the game was made in one year from scratch and with very little funding.

In anticipation of our next lap around the sun, Awesome Games Done Quick has released its full schedule for 2024&#x27;s charity speedrun event in January. Taking place between 14th and 21st January (both online and, in a change from recent years, also in person in Pittsburgh), the event features an extensive speedrunning schedule. This will include Peanut Butter the dog, who will be speedrunning the 1985 NES platformer Gyromite! What a Su-paw-star.


Other highlights from the upcoming invent include an Any% speedrun of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by gymnast86, a The Last of Us PS4 Any% speedrun and modded Hades speedrun that will see two players (arcalena and trash_lapras) using one controller and three weapons to get through the game.

A brief teaser video posted to X, formerly Twitter, reveals the Fallout series release date: 12th April 2024.


(Of course, this date is written in the American style, so 4/12/24. But good news, it isn&#x27;t debuting next December.)

To compare, Neowiz&#x27;s puppet Soulslike Lies of P reached 1m sales in under a month across the same platforms, though is additionally available on Xbox Game Pass (undercutting that sales figure).

The eye-catching total makes the Spidey sequel Sony&#x27;s fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever - referring to releases made by the company&#x27;s own studios. 
That ginormous launch means Spider-Man 2 hit the 2.5m copies milestone faster than any God of War, Uncharted or The Last of Us. It&#x27;s also faster to that total than Spider-Man 1.

                              <span>What&#x27;s scarier than a 10-foot tall, indestructible Xenomorph lurking about and stalking you to your death? Yes, you guessed it - Thomas the Tank Engine.
Modder Matt Filer has given us exactly that, with a new mod he released earlier today. This also marks the first mod which swaps the Xenomorph out for something else, Filer says, which is quite surprising. Alien: Isolation seems like the perfect fodder for this kind of thing, but a quick scan on Nexus Mods shows indeed, there aren&#x27;t any mods which do this already.
Filer has put a short but sweet paragraph into the mod&#x27;s description: &quot;This mod swaps the Xenomorph for Thomas the Tank Engine. I&#x27;m so sorry.&quot;

                              <span>When asked about a possible third Spider-Man game, Spider-Man 2&#x27;s creative director Bryan Intihar likened the sequel to the MCU&#x27;s Captain America: Civil War.


Speaking on Skill Up&#x27;s Friends Per Second podcast, conversation with the developer turned to a &quot;hypothetical&quot; third main game in Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man series. Inthar was understandably quiet for a good while, clearly not wanting to give too much of the studio&#x27;s plans for the series away. 


However, after some careful deliberation, the developer said whatever could happen next would undoubtedly be &quot;pretty epic&quot;.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has taken less than four years to develop thanks to team chemistry.


Between 80-90 percent of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake development team have continued their work on Rebirth, allowing for efficient development, its director has said.


&quot;It was quite clear who to go to if we had a certain question or problem we were trying to solve,&quot; director Naoki Hamaguchi told Bloomberg. &quot;We were able to work together as a team, achieve this great flow and tempo of game development.&quot;

Squadron 42 was originally announced for release in 2014, but has been delayed multiple times. A beta release was scheduled for mid-2020, before it too was delayed by three months. Later that year, CIG director Chris Roberts admitted the game was still a way off from a beta phase.
The recent update on Squadron 42 came during this year&#x27;s CitizenCon, along with a development video - which you can watch further below.

Following the game&#x27;s release last week, fans have been poring over its details. One such detail was the inclusion of a Cuban flag in Miles&#x27; house, as well as various Cuban flags in the surrounding area. However, Miles is not from Cuba. His mother, Rio Morales, is Puerto Rican, and while both flags are similar, the colours are different.


Many noticed this slip-up. Over the weekend, reddit user TheHouselessTurtle shared a screenshot from the game showing the Cuban flag inside Miles&#x27; home.

Insomniac&#x27;s sequel is the fourth-biggest UK boxed game launch of 2023, behind EA Sports FC, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Hogwarts Legacy.


All of this means Nintendo Switch exclusive Super Mario Bros. Wonder had to contend for second place this week, though Nintendo games tend to sell more consistently over the weeks that follow.

The patch notes, available on Steam, detail the post-game changes which will now no longer remove all vestiges (checkpoints). Instead, each iteration of New Game Plus will remove more vestiges until NG+3 when all will be removed for the biggest challenge.


In addition, players will have the option to continue their current game retaining character, items and progression but resetting the world to allow completionists to finish outstanding tasks. A customisable NG+ modifier system is also on the way so players can tweak the experience themselves.

EA confirmed over a year ago that it was developing a single-player third-person action adventure Iron Man game as part of a new collaboration between it and Marvel for &quot;several&quot; new projects. And just like the Dead Space remake - which was acclaimed by critics and players alike – Motive hopes to utilise a fan-based community council to keep it on the right track.

&quot;I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been over a year since my last update about our beloved Motive Studio,&quot; GM Patrick Klaus said by way of a statement posted to the official website.

                              <span>Good news, video game music fans – Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has dropped a fresh batch of video game soundtracks onto streaming platform Spotify.

As spotted by AniPlaylist, Sony has added the soundtracks for games like Gravity Rush, Shadow of the Colossus, Wild Arms, and PoPoLoCrois, expanding the SIE Sound Team&#x27;s discography that already boasts free-to-stream soundtracks for games like Bloodborne and The Last Guardian.

For now, it seems as though these soundtracks have only been added to Spotify and are not currently coming up on Apple Music and other music streaming platforms, but we&#x27;ll let you know if and when that changes.

In the recent Kubernetes v1.28 release, we (SIG Storage) introduced a new alpha feature that aims to improve PersistentVolume (PV)
storage management and help cluster administrators gain better insights into the lifecycle of PVs.
With the addition of the lastPhaseTransitionTime field into the status of a PV,
cluster administrators are now able to track the last time a PV transitioned to a different
phase, allowing for more efficient

The Junji-Ito-inspired roguelike RPG from developer Paweł Koźmiński has finally slithered out of early access and made the jump to PlayStation and Switch as well as its native PC home.

To celebrate, publishers Ysbryd Games has dropped a new trailer to mark the 1.0 release, and give you an unsettling sight into what, exactly, World of Horror has in store for you:

After giving his viewers a &quot;jumpscare warning&quot;, YouTuber Mike Monty showed off HiBlakkes&#x27; Freddy Fazbear Over Cyrax mod, which replaces Cyrax with the monstrous animatronic.

&quot;If you don&#x27;t know, I modded the game so you get Freddy Fazbear,&quot; Monty explains in his video, just in case viewers got confused about the unexpected guest star.

During a Q&amp;A with Final Fantasy 14 director and producer Naoki Yoshida at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest, Sakaguchi used the latest game - Final Fantasy 16 - as an example.



&quot;I felt this when I saw Final Fantasy 16 and this comes from a perspective of someone who creates these different works,&quot; said Sakaguchi. &quot;I think with Final Fantasy you always want to take a challenge to take an adventure into building a new system for the new installment, that courage to be able to take that risk.

                              <span>We already knew that Final Fantasy 14 was making one of its most unusual crossover events yet by teaming up with the bean-tastic Fall Guys, but now we can see it in action courtesy of a new teaser that dropped during Final Fantasy Fan Fest.

Ed&#x27;s on the ground and keeping us updated with the latest coming out of the fest – including confirmation of Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s latest job and a Final Fantasy 16 x Final Fantasy 14 crossover – but here&#x27;s a fresh peek at the mayhem that ensues when you put your favourite Final Fantasy 14 characters into a Fall Guys map:

Fall Guys fans will be pleased to know the Gold Saucer crossover will launch next week on 31st October. Rounds based on the popular party game will be available periodically for groups of 24 – with random matchmaking – and unique prizes can be won.

                              <span>A writer at Ubisoft has posted what seems to be an unknown Assassin&#x27;s Creed character on their LinkedIn profile.

Pierre Boudreau – an &quot;award-winning writer for Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; – has posted the mysterious character as the header image for their professional profile, with many speculating that this may be the lead character for the mysterious Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codenamed Red.

Why? Well, the image shared to the Leaks and Gaming Rumours subreddit boasts a bright red background and a Japanese temple, which ties in with the little we already know about Ubisoft&#x27;s next blockbuster-sized Assassin-y instalment.

Earlier this month, we warned that Counter-Strike 2 players with an AMD GPU could face a VAC ban if they activated Anti-Lag+.

Unfortunately, the way the Anti-Lag+ feature works - it does its job by &quot;detouring engine dll functions&quot;, according to Valve - can have serious consequences for Counter-Strike 2 players who opt to turn it on.

                              <span>Remedy has revealed the full system requirements to run its highly-anticipated sequel, Alan Wake 2, on PC.

Offering minimum, recommended, and ultra specs – as well as what you&#x27;ll get if you select low, medium, and high ray tracing settings – players can assess how their machines will fare when running the PC version… and it certainly seems that you&#x27;ll need a pretty powerful rig just to run it, let alone max out the performance.

The requirements, which were posted to its social media channels overnight, show that upscalers will be required for 30fps, and the game will take up around 90GB of your storage.

                              <span>EA has disabled an EA Sports FC 24 perk in order to address a glitch that was giving some players an unfair in-game advantage.

The newly-discovered glitch in the soccer sim popped up earlier in the week, allowing dribblers with the Trickster Playstyle to attach the ball to their calf and then simply run into the opposition&#x27;s net to score.

After first acknowledging the glitch was a problem, EA has now confirmed that it has &quot;temporarily removed&quot; the FUT perk to prevent players from exploiting the bug in competitive play.

                              <span>It&#x27;s so hard to secure a Twitch partnership these days that even its own CEO had their application rejected.

Twitch CEO Daniel Clancy announced on Twitter/X earlier today that he decided to apply to the Partner Program, but kept the application under wraps to see what would happen.

&quot;For anyone that got denied being a Partner from Twitch, don&#x27;t feel so bad,&quot; Clancy said. &quot;Just got my Partner application denied. Did not tell anyone I was applying.

                              <span>European Spidey fans are struggling to install Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 from physical discs.

That&#x27;s according to dozens of players posting in the game&#x27;s official subreddit community, some of whom are reporting that the installation stalls when it hits 36 per cent.

According to those who&#x27;ve experienced the issue, it doesn&#x27;t matter if they take the game back and swap it for a brand new disc – whatever mitigations they try to put in place, be that turning off internet connection, cleaning the disc, or even a factory reset – the installation always stops at the same point.

                              <span>A dev build of Overkill&#x27;s The Walking Dead has leaked online.

The build reportedly contains unreleased content from the lacklustre zombie shooter as well as content that made the final release back in 2018.
There is no way to purchase a legal copy of the game anymore as, just a year on from its 2018 release, Skybound revoked Starbreeze&#x27;s The Walking Dead license and the beleaguered game was unceremoniously pulled from sale.

                              <span>With reports increasingly pointing to a Switch 2 launch next year, Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has talked a little about the company&#x27;s perspective on entering a new console generation, saying he believes its Nintendo Account system will help &#x27;ease the transition&#x27;.


While Bowser, unsurprisingly, refused to comment on reports of a Switch successor specifically, he highlighted to Inverse (in the same interview where he discussed unionisation at Nintendo) the work the company has done on its single sign-in Nintendo Accounts. 


&quot;One thing we&#x27;ve done with the Switch to help with that communication and transition [to a new console generation]&quot;, Bowser explained, &quot;is the formation of the Nintendo Account. In the past, every device we transitioned to had a whole new account system. Creating the Nintendo Account will allow us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition.&quot;

                              <span>Salt and Sacrifice, the follow-up to Ska Studios&#x27; enormously enjoyable 2D Soulslike Salt and Sanctuary, is making the jump to Switch and Steam (following a period of Epic Games Store exclusivity) on 7th November.


Salt and Sacrifice serves up another gloomy slab of side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat, albeit one that builds on its 2016 predecessor with a variety of new features, as players - in the role of a Marked Inquisitor - make their way across the world of Alterstone Kingdom, and its abandoned villages, dungeons, tomb-temples, and other landmarks.


Those new features include a refreshed choice of classes - Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage - plus Mage hunts, which play out as multi-part pursuits that culminate in a fearsome boss battle. There&#x27;s also enhanced PvP - with new moves and different objectives depending on your chosen sect - and, for those with a more collaborative streak, two-player online and off-line co-op.

                              <span>Saturnalia, the acclaimed - and previously Epic Games Store-exclusive - survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is coming to Steam on 8th November.


While Santa Ragione (which also published Lorenzo Redaelli&#x27;s stellar post-COVID horror Mediterranea Inferno earlier this year) hasn&#x27;t quite managed to get Saturnalia onto Steam in time for Halloween, it remains a spookily good time - whisking players away to the ancient village of Gravoi for an Sardinian folklore-inspired adventure that Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin called a &quot;horrible nightmare in all the right ways&quot; in his Recommended review.


The aim of Saturnalia is to solve the mystery of Gravoi and escape its confines, exploring and avoiding its horrors along the way. To that end, players can switch between four different characters at will as they try to win their freedom, but if everyone dies, the town reconfigures its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

                              <span>In a year that&#x27;s seen significant moves toward unionisation across the games industry, Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has argued the reason the company doesn&#x27;t have unions is because its workers have a &quot;high degree of job satisfaction and engagement&quot;.


Bowser shared his thoughts in an interview with Inverse, saying, &quot;You only have to look at our retention numbers, which are very, very high within the industry, and our obviously low turnover rate as a result. Our focus has always been on creating a culture that&#x27;s inclusive, has a work-life balance, and is focused on our singular mission of bringing smiles to faces.&quot;


Bowser added he believes Nintendo is &quot;on the right path&quot; when it comes to creating a &quot;work environment and culture that allows people to be productive, to have balance in their lives, and to grow within the company&quot;.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss what&#x27;s next for Microsoft and Activision Blizzard now they have finally tied the knot.
This week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer sounded a note of caution over how quickly we&#x27;d see the fruits of Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition for ourselves. There will be no immediate drop of Activision classics on Xbox Game Pass, and no sudden insertion of Master Chief in Call of Duty. 
Long-term, though, Spencer is keen to hear from Activision&#x27;s teams about what they want to make - whether that&#x27;s a return to Guitar Hero, Skylanders or Tony Hawk games, or something else entirely. We also ponder Microsoft&#x27;s plans for a mobile game presence, driven by Candy Crush maker King. Could Gears of War turn up on mobile? What about Viva Piñata? Joining me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

This brisk performance was achieved by Mae, a known speedrunner in the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 community. Mae previously managed to complete a Sex Any% speedrun in just under eight minutes, and has been whittling that time down ever since. 


&quot;After just over two months, the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 speedrunning community has finally peaked. The two minute barrier has been shattered,&quot; Mae celebrated on their YouTube channel earlier today. &quot;We can now bang Lae&#x27;zel in under two minutes, even faster than a speedrunner can last in real life. This is the world&#x27;s first sub-two minute run and the new world record.&quot;

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 released today, with a storyline that developer Insomniac has said will take, on average, about 15 hours to complete if you just stick to the main story missions. If players decide to delve deeper, and complete side missions and collectables, that gameplay time could be extended to around 40 hours. 


When it first came to light that Spider-Man 2&#x27;s main story could be wrapped up in a relatively short amount of time - especially when compared to the likes of this year&#x27;s Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, which can take players literal days to complete - some felt that Insomniac was asking too high a price for its sequel. Here in the UK, Spider-Man 2 is £69.99 for the standard PS5 edition. If players want to upgrade to the digital deluxe version, it will set them back £79.99. 


Many have argued that game length should influence the retail price of a product, and therefore Spider-Man 2 should be priced lower than what is essentially £70. Insomniac&#x27;s creative director Bryan Intihar has weighed in on this, and said that Spider-Man 2 is absolutely &quot;worth it&quot;.

                              <span>A newly-discovered glitch in EA Sports FC 24 is doing the rounds for both looking very silly and managing to break the beautiful game.
The &quot;calf dribble&quot;, as it&#x27;s been dubbed by some in the FIFA community, allows dribblers with the Trickster Playstyle to attach the ball to their calf and then simply run into the opposition&#x27;s net to score.
As funny as it is to watch, that&#x27;s definitely not how it&#x27;s meant to work, in video game or real-life football.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Friday, and I have found another fun thing to share with you all, this time in Halo Infinite&#x27;s Forge mode.

Halo Infinite&#x27;s Forge mode has long been used as a canvas for many video game related homages. We have seen the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&#x27;s iconic Kokiri Forest pop up here, as well as PT&#x27;s terrifying corridor and Call of Duty&#x27;s famous Shipment map. Blood Gulch is even in there (although, actually that one wasn&#x27;t really a surprise, but all the same very cool)


The possibilities this mode can invoke are seemingly endless, and the recent update that came with Season 5: Reckoning has made this even more apparent. You see, developer 343 added the ability to include Campaign AI. This is thanks to the addition of Forge&#x27;s AI Toolkit and its accompanying suite of features, which means Halo Infinite players can now spawn Grunts and such into their creations.

                              <span>Stage plays and musicals are regular occurrences for Japanese games, and Final Fantasy is no stranger to them.
Earlier this week, Square Enix announced it is producing a new stage play based on the mobile game Warriors of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
The game is a free-to-play tactical RPG title which was released globally in 2020. Although our usual Final Fantasy correspondent (Ed) is not here, I try to (or at least like to think I do) stay up-to-date with the series and I&#x27;ve never heard of it before.

                              <span>Microsoft went all-out on Xbox advertising with its takeover of the Las Vegas Sphere last night.

For anyone unfamiliar with the Sphere, it&#x27;s a dome-shaped entertainment arena which opened last month. The inside wall has wraparound LED screen, and on the outside there&#x27;s LED display space used for advertising.

Xbox is the latest company to use the Sphere for advertising, lighting up Las Vegas with its green logo to coincide with TwitchCon.

The developer has released a helpful trailer to fill you in on everything that happened in both Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and Miles Morales. The trailer shows our two webbed heroes recalling past battles against the likes of Dr Otto Octavius. They also reflect on their lost loved ones, like Aunt May and Miles&#x27; dad, Jefferson &quot;Jeff&quot; Davis. It&#x27;s touching stuff.


Now, if you were watching that and thinking &quot;Great! I love Spider-Man, and even with the sequel just out I already want more&quot;, you may also be asking yourself: &quot;Venom I going to get a villain-focused spinoff, in the style of Spider-Man: Miles Morales?&quot;

The company said its donation would be split between the Japanese Red Cross and UNICEF. Sony employees can also add their own money, which the company will then match.


&quot;Sony respects and supports the human rights of all people,&quot; Sony said in a statement. &quot;We strongly oppose terrorism, violence against civilians, hate, and other acts that threaten human life, livelihood, and dignity, and wish for the restoration of peace in the region.&quot;

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s space-faring 4X strategy game Stellaris is preparing to fire the expansion cannon once more, blasting its new narrative-focused Astral Planes DLC across alternative dimensions and onto PC &quot;later this year&quot;.


Astral Planes will bring &quot;reality-breaking&quot; technology to Stellaris, giving players the chance to explore new parallel dimensions - encountering strange new creatures, long-buried secrets, and mysterious phenomena along the way.


Paradox says Astral Planes is predominantly focused on delivering &quot;mid-to-late game exploration content&quot;, introducing 30 Astral Rifts where players can experience branching narratives and storylines - utilising a &quot;dedicated interface, specifically designed to maximize the effects of player choice&quot; - taking place in completely different realms of existence.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors developer Poncle is giving us a bit of a two-for-one with its minimalist survival RPG&#x27;s latest free update, combining sufficiently spooksome chills for Halloween and all the snow-speckled wintery fun you might reasonably require when things start to get a bit jollier later on. It&#x27;s called the Chilling Update (because of all the snow, yes?) and it&#x27;s available now.


The Chilling Update - also known as v1.7.0 - introduces a new playable character, a new bonus stage, a new evolving weapon, two new relics, six new EXTRA achievements, and a new music track. If that&#x27;s enough information to get you salivating and you&#x27;d rather avoid spoiling the fun before diving in, stop reading now - otherwise it&#x27;s time to go through all the above in more detail, starting with the new stage, Whiteout.


Whiteout is described a &quot;20-minute bonus stage&quot; in Poncle&#x27;s patch notes, and it&#x27;s unlocked by picking up a total of 20 Orologions. Once inside, players will encounter snowmen insistent on blocking their path, and face enemies which, according to Poncle, move very slowly and are particularly susceptible to fire. &quot;So for most of it,&quot; the studio explains, &quot;there isn&#x27;t anything particularly challenging&quot; - although you might want to save your spicy sausage for the boss.

                              <span>A new Apex Legends season - season 19, to be more specific - is almost upon, meaning the start of another drip-feed hype cycle, which has now begun in earnest with the official reveal of the free-to-play battle royale shooter&#x27;s newest playable hero, Conduit.


As is the way with these things, Conduit - described by developer Respawn as a &quot;tiny titan of optimism&quot; - gets her introduction by way of a new Stories from the Outlands lore trailer. And, yes, there&#x27;s more Titanfall fan-baiting to try and distract everyone from the fact we still haven&#x27;t got a Titanfall 3, despite persistent teasing from the studio.


Once upon time, you see, Conduit&#x27;s life was saved by a Monarch Titan during a violent battle that threatened to destroy her hometown - the machine&#x27;s pilot choosing to sacrifice themselves in a massive detonation that would ultimately bring fighting to an explosive end.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been three years since Ubisoft announced it was working on a VR instalment of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, and with the game - now officially titled Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR - nearing its release, the company has shared an extensive eight-minute gameplay breakdown to get players in the mood ahead of its November launch on Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro.


Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR (which Ubisoft describes as an &quot;all-new full-length Assassin&#x27;s Creed action-adventure game&quot;) casts players as an elite hacker working undercover at Abstergo on behalf of the Brotherhood. From here, they&#x27;ll be able to shove their eyes into the heads of three returning series protagonists - Ezio Auditore, Connor, and Kassandra - in an attempt to locate a number of mysterious artefacts they encountered during their lives.


It&#x27;s a quest that, in classic series fashion, will see players scrambling, sneaking, stabbing, and clobbering their way around some big open maps, this time spanning Renaissance Italy, Colonial America, and Ancient Greece - including Venice, Boston, and even some new locations such as Newport (presumably the Rhode Island one and not the one in Wales).

This is the essential question being taken up by the Federal Election Commission this month, and public input is needed to curtail the potential for AI to take US campaigns (even more) off the rails.
At issue is whether candidates using AI to create deepfaked media for political advertisements should be considered fraud or legitimate electioneering. That is, is it allowable to use AI image generators to create photorealistic images depicting Trump hugging Anthony Fauci? And is it allowable to use ...</span>

That&#x27;s according to Insomniac&#x27;s director of community and marketing, James Stevenson, who shared the news in answer to a fan query on social media. &quot;We&#x27; re working on an update for those features,&quot; he explained, adding, &quot;but they won&#x27;t be in Day 1.&quot;


Insomniac&#x27;s original Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man launched in September 2018 and received a New Game Plus mode just one month later - and it appears the studio is aiming to add the feature to Spider-Man 2 in a similarly brisk fashion, with Stevenson later explaining Insomniac is hoping to get New Game Plus out to players &quot;before end of year.&quot;

                              <span>The Epic Games Store is going all-in with survival horror for its free games during Halloween this year, as next week you&#x27;ll be able to grab a copy of The Evil Within 2. Up for keeps alongside it will be puzzle platformer Tandem: A Tale of Shadows.
The Evil Within 2 is the sequel to Shinji Mikami&#x27;s 2014 return to survival horror, and Edwin found it entertainin but lacking with its spooks, in his Evil Within 2 review back in 2017. The game follows police detective Sebastian Castellanos as he attempts to rescue his daughter from a virtual town which is overrun with mutated people. 
If you want to play The Evil Within before dipping into the sequel, it&#x27;s currently one of the freebies on offer at the Epic Games Store, alongside Eternal Threads.

                              <span>Microsoft has released a big budget live-action Xbox Series X/S advert, timed for the holiday season, which showcases several high-profile console exclusives. 


The advert begins with a young woman making her way home from what is presumably a long day at work. As Nintendo did earlier in the year when it released its live-action Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, Microsoft seems to be highlighting the welcome relief games can provide, away from the everyday, rain-soaked mundane. 


This young lady in question is soon swept out of her apartment block&#x27;s lift and transported into a world of wonder and excitement. Starfield&#x27;s Vasco holds her bag as a spaceship blasts off. Her world turns upside down again, as the wandering whispers of Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 surround her. She leaves, to suddenly find her corridor turned into a Forza racetrack, and then find a random Cyberpunk 2077 chap in her flat chopping up pineapples with furious force. You get the idea.

                              <span>It looks like the release date of Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5 Slim has leaked, along with a Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 bundle.

Sony announced its PS5 Slim last week, which will launch in November in the US before being rolled out to other countries. Once inventory of the existing model has sold out, the new Slim model will be the only one available.



Billbil-kun of Dealabs has noted several Japanese merchants have opened pre-orders, with a release date of 10th November, suggesting this might be when it&#x27;s available in the US too.

For those unfamiliar, this is generally how new FM games roll out each year, with a period of up to a month before the official release date - in FM24&#x27;s case, 6th November - being marked out as a kind of final public test, which you can gain access to by pre-ordering the game with a small discount.
It&#x27;s the same again here, albeit with just two-and-a-half weeks until it&#x27;s out this time, and with the shift to calling it Early Access from now on, as Sports Interactive gaffer Miles Jacobson is keen to emphasise.

Donlan summed it up in his Super Mario Bros. Wonder review for us: &quot;But Elephant Mario is the star. What a guy.&quot;
Nintendo seemingly knew Elephant Mario would be a big hit with fans, as there&#x27;s already a plush in the works by regular official collaborator Sanei Bokei, due for release in January 2024.

                              <span>Hellboy Web of Wyrd has launched across platforms, with its release marking one of Lance Reddick&#x27;s final performances following his death earlier this year.


Reddick stars as Hellboy in Web of Wyrd, a roguelike action brawler. It promises an original story, which the studio has curated in partnership with Dark Horse Comics as well as Hellboy&#x27;s own creator Mike Mignola, although one which doesn&#x27;t interfere with what Mignola himself is up to. 


&quot;When an agent of the BPRD goes missing, Hellboy is sent to investigate; pulling him into the depths of the Wyrd,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. You can see how it looks, and hear the late, great Lance Reddick, in the video below.

                              <span>No, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&#x27;s fast-travel hold-to-confirm prompt is not hiding a load point. It could have been even faster, but developer Insomniac made the decision to value player usability over speed and scoring points on the internet.


Spider-Man 2&#x27;s fast-travel capabilities have been widely shared across social media, and are so slick that some players have said they believe the requirement to hold down a button and confirm your fast-travelling before shooting off across the game&#x27;s map was all designed as a bit of trickery to hide background loading. 


Well, that&#x27;s not the case. This theory has now been squashed by Insomniac&#x27;s own director of core technologies Mike Fitzgerald. As part of a ResetEra thread discussing Spider-Man 2&#x27;s review scores, Fitzgerald said Insomniac discussed removing the hold-to-confirm prompt in a bid to &quot;address that accusation&quot;, before it ultimately decided this wasn&#x27;t the best idea.

Peanut Butter will speedrun Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES which used the Robotic Operating Buddy accessory. Peanut Butter uses a custom controller and you can see him in action completing the game in 25 minutes and 29 seconds on YouTube.  
As you can see in the video, JSR_ directs Peanut Butter to press buttons and gives him a reward for doing so. &quot;This took years of training,&quot; JSR_ said, adding that no assistance, autofire, macro, or states were used.

                              <span>Netflix is increasing the monthly cost of its subscription, despite an influx of subscribers over the past few months.


In the UK, its basic service with adverts will rise to £7.99, while the premium ad-free option will rise to £17.99. The standard tier (no ads, but also no 4K) will remain at £10.99. American and French customers will also be affected.


That&#x27;s despite an increase of 8.8 million subscribers from July to September, reports the BBC.

                              <span>Sony has filed a patent for a PS5 controller which stores and charges wireless earbuds.
The earbuds would be stored in a pair of slots located inside the controller. As well as charging them, the controller would also pair the earbuds to a console.
The patent (spotted by GameRant) contains different variations of where the earbuds could be slotted into the controller. Most of the designs propose the earbuds are stored behind the touchpad, though one option places an earbud in each of the controller&#x27;s grips.

                              <span>Lords of the Fallen has received new Steam updates to address performance issues and balance changes.

Patch 1.1.203 was released yesterday which fixed a number of stability issues to prevent crashes. In addition, subtantial performance improvements have been implemented to free up VRAM and &quot;provide additional headroom for GPUs that are operating at the limit of their capabilities&quot;.



Thankfully some balance changes have also been made. For instance, the price of seeds has now been reduced - these are used to create temporary checkpoints throughout the world but were an expensive and limited resource.

                              <span>Zen Studios, the team behind the Pinball FX series, is reportedly one of the latest companies to have been hit by layoffs this year.


As shared by Videogamelayoffs (via VGC), an unnamed source from the studio revealed 32 members of staff from the Hungary-based developer had lost their jobs earlier this month. 


Zen Studios was one of the many studios acquired by Embracer Group in 2020, when the Swedish video game and media holding company acquired the developer through Saber Interactive.

                              <span>Microsoft has outlined some of the new Xbox accessibility features due in the coming months, including the ability to remap keyboard keys to the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2.


As detailed over on Xbox Wire, players will soon be able to remap almost 90 keyboard keys - or combinations of keys - to any button on the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Elite Series 2, meaning users with limited mobility can, for instance, use the Xbox Adaptive Controller with games that would ordinarily only support mouse/keyboard.


The feature - which will be available through the Xbox Accessories app on PC and console - is currently being tested by Xbox Insiders and Xbox Accessibility Insiders League (XAIL) members, but is due to launch for all players at some point &quot;in the coming months&quot;.

                              <span>CD Projekt has officially brought the development of its Witcher card game spin-off Gwent to a close with one last update, putting all future balance changes in the hands of the community.


Gwent, of course, started life as a turn-based card-collecting mini-game in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (although, technically, it existed on the page of author Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s Witcher novels before that) and was expanded into its own full-scale release in 2018.


As development has continued, Gwent has recieved new cards, content updates, and expansions - as well as a standalone single-player story campaign in 2020&#x27;s Thronebreaker and a rogue-like solo deck-builder in 2022&#x27;s Gwent: Rogue Mage - but last December brought the news CD Projekt would wind down development after three new expansions in 2023.

                              <span>Paradox has confirmed Cities: Skylines 2 won&#x27;t be getting official mod support until sometime after next week&#x27;s release, with the feature set to arrive alongside its first wave of modding tools.


Official mod support was one of the original Cities: Skylines&#x27; most exciting features when it launched back in 2015, and the city builder quickly developed a vibrant modding scene that played a significant role in its early success. More than 333,000 mods are now available for the first Cities: Skylines via Steam Workshop, and Paradox has even tapped modders to create official DLC for the game over the years.


As for Cities: Skylines&#x27; imminent sequel, Paradox broke the news that mods would not be officially supported at launch in a developer diary shared on its website. And while it hasn&#x27;t yet offered an estimated time of arrival for the feature, it&#x27;s now published a second mod-focused developer update explaining official mod tools and mod support will arrive simulataneously post-release, once Cities: Skylines 2&#x27;s all-in-one Editor leaves beta testing.

                              <span>Roblox is mandating most remote employees return to office working three days a week, or take a severance package.

Employees were notified of the change yesterday, Roblox CEO David Baszucki said in an open letter sent to staff.
Affected employees have been given three months, until 16th January 2024, to decide whether they wish to stay at Roblox. Those who do relocate are being asked to work from Roblox&#x27;s offices in San Mateo, California by 15th July 2024. Baszucki told employees the company will assist with relocation costs.

Mega Crit was one of many developers to criticise Unity&#x27;s decision to begin charging studios fees based on the number times their game was installed by a user (Unity has since walked back on some of its changes, and CEO John Riccitiello departed not long after), writing, &quot;Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into the development on our new title, we will be migrating to a new engine unless the changes are completely reverted and [Terms of Service] protections are put in place.&quot;


Shortly after Unity&#x27;s controversial announcement, Mega Crit held a three-week game jam to &quot;explore the Godot engine due to &#x27;recent events&#x27;&quot;. The result of those experiments is Dancing Duelists, a &quot;deckbuilding autobattler dance off with a BUMPIN&#x27; soundtrack&quot;.

Switchback VR is a spiritual successor to Rush of Blood on PSVR, and is an on-rails shooter set on a horror-themed rollercoaster.
The Horde mode, described by developer Supermassive Games as &quot;nightmarish&quot;, pits the player against swarms of enemies, with each room containing increasingly tougher enemies.

Nintendo has released the final part of its Ask the Developer interview for the game, which includes discussion of live commentary that was ultimately scrapped.


&quot;Tezuka-san also once asked, &#x27;Can&#x27;t we have live commentary?&#x27;. I had absolutely no clue what he meant. But I interpreted it as a desire for a new experience, even if it&#x27;s not necessarily in the form of live commentary,&quot; said Shiro Mouri, the game&#x27;s director.

Second Extinction is a co-op, online shooter set in a futuristic world where mutated dinosaurs threaten humans. It released in early access for PC in 2020, and Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021. The game&#x27;s 1.0 version was meant to release late last year, but &quot;critical&quot; and &quot;show-stopping&quot; issues caused the studio to delay it.
&quot;Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets,&quot; Systemic Reaction said on Steam, &quot;and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear&quot;. As such, the developer has decided to cancel the game&#x27;s full release.

                              <span>A Comic Book Skin DLC for Sonic Superstars was briefly available on Steam after the game&#x27;s release, but is now mysteriously unavailable.


The latest in Sega&#x27;s series was released yesterday, alongside a number of DLC costumes. For instance, the Sonic Rabbit skin and Mecha Sonic skin are available as part of the Extra Content Pack (priced at £11.98), while Lego skins are available for free.


However, the Comic Book Skin DLC was also briefly available, providing cel-shaded versions of the four main characters. The pack is still listed on Steam, but is unavailable to download or purchase.

Speaking on the Official Xbox Podcast, Spencer discussed his next moves now Microsoft formally owns all of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s franchises - including Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot.


Spencer is now off to meet Activision Blizzard&#x27;s many teams in person, via a whistlestop tour of the company&#x27;s studios. There, he said he will discuss what the teams want to work on.

The game isn&#x27;t even out yet, but already it&#x27;s playable on PC via emulators and leaked copies. That means it&#x27;s moddable too.


That&#x27;s exactly what modder Contendo did, making all the talking flowers in the game swear.

In a social media post, the developer said the team has made &quot;notable enhancements&quot; to Spider-Man 2 since the game went gold. Therefore, those who have purchased the game physically won&#x27;t get the optimal version of this release without the patch in play. 


&quot;This update features polish to the gold master version of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 available on disc, which improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to your Spidey experience,&quot; Insomniac explained. This includes some accessibility options.

As has become typical of Nintendo, it&#x27;s released an Ask the Developer interview with the development team to discuss its latest release.


Development of the game was completely separate from the film, it says, so new elements in Wonder are unrelated.

Speaking on the Official Xbox Podcast, Spencer acknowledged the recent suggestion by Activision Blizzard that it would take until 2024 to get its games added to Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service, and discussed why there wasn&#x27;t going to be a big drop of games sooner - as happened when Microsoft bought Bethesda.


Spencer even noted there had been &quot;a lot of uncertainty&quot; in the buyout process for Microsoft - right up until the deal was finally approved by the UK&#x27;s regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, last week.

                              <span>The co-op horror game Phasmophobia will not release on consoles this month, following another delay.

Phasmophobia was originally meant to release into early access on console in August, but an office fire incident in August caused developer Kinect Games to push launch back to October.

The release date is being pushed back again, meaning Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait a little bit longer to join the ghost-hunting. In a developer update posted to Steam, Kinect Games attributed the latest delay to August&#x27;s fire incident and issues in porting the game to consoles and VR.

In an interview on the official Xbox podcast, the exec spoke more about last week&#x27;s historic merger that finally saw Microsoft close the deal on its Activision Blizzard King buyout. He phil-ed us in, if you will. 


Of course, during last night&#x27;s interview, the topic of Call of Duty came up. This series has often been front and centre of the ongoing trials and tribulations of recent times. In fact, at one point, Sony suggested Microsoft could deliberately release a version of the game on PlayStation platforms with degraded performance (something Microsoft said it would not do).

                              <span>Developer Stairway Games has announced its tropical island farming sim Coral Island will be getting its 1.0 release on 14th November after just over a year of PC early access, and it&#x27;ll be launching for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 on the same day.


Coral Island, which entered early access last October on Steam and the Microsoft Store, is yet another entry in the ever-growing list of farming sims heavily inspired by Stardew Valley&#x27;s more modern take on the genre (it even has an evil corporate entity of its own), but it&#x27;s aiming to set itself apart with a focus on ocean exploration and conservation.


Of course, all the familiar genre staples are present and correct too, including farming, crafting, fishing, mining, decorating, socialising, and, of course, wooing, with Coral Island featuring 25 eligible islanders to romance as one season gives way to the next.

                              <span>UPDATE 8.28pm: Diablo 4&#x27;s Season of Blood is now live on all platforms following a last-minute delay which Blizzard blamed on &quot;complications&quot;. Unfortunately, not all technical issues have been resolved as yet, and Blizzard has been forced to temporarily disable cross-play between PC and consoles while it attempts to find a solution.


&quot;We are working to resolve this,&quot; the developer explained in an update on social media, &quot;and will provide updates as they are available.&quot;


Season of Blood arrives alongside Diablo 4&#x27;s Steam release, which also saw a bit of a delay earlier today. It comes with a 25% launch week discount, ending on 24th October, meaning you can currently pick it up for £44.99 instead of the usual £59.99.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced it is parting ways with BattleTech developer Harebrained Schemes, citing &quot;strategic and creative priorities&quot;. The seperation follows last week&#x27;s news that Harebrained Schemes&#x27; The Lamplighters League has been a $22m flop for Paradox.


Harebrained was founded in 2011 by Mitch Gitelman and Jordan Weisman (co-creator of the BattleTech and MechWarrior universe), and was acquired by Paradox Interactive in 2018 after it published the studio&#x27;s critically acclaimed BattleTech game that same year.


The Lamplighters League, which launched earlier this month, was Harebrained&#x27;s first release as a Paradox studio but it arrived to middling reviews and failed to generate much commercial interest. Paradox went as far as to call its commercial performance a &quot;big disappointment&quot; last week, when it admitted the pulp strategy game was unlikely to recoup its development costs, resulting in a $22.7m USD write-down.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re super-excited for the release of Alan Wake 2 later this month, but can&#x27;t quite recall the events of the first game (entirely reasonably seeing as the original version came out over a decade ago), Fortnite of all places might have the answer. Epic has whacked a free playable 20-minute Alan Wake recap episode that should serve as a refresher while offering a bit of spooky battery gobbling fun along the way.


Alan&#x27;s first adventure, released all the way back in 2010, sees the eponymous writer taking a working holiday with his wife, Alice, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Needless to say, it doesn&#x27;t take long for things to go awry, and, soon, Alan - with occasional help from his agent BARRY - is monologuing his way through the night, blasting malevolent beings to smithereens with his torch and revealing the next big spooky event 10 seconds before it happens because he can&#x27;t keep his mouth shut.


Or at least that&#x27;s how I remember it. Presumably Epic&#x27;s newly released Alan Wake: Flashback - a &#x27;reimagining&#x27; of the original tale, developed in collaboration with Remedy Entertainment, Spiral House, and Zen Creative - will do a better and more reliable job of filling you in on all the important story beats ahead of Alan Wake 2.

                              <span>Exactly 364 after its announcement, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - NetherRealm&#x27;s free-to-play character-collecting RPG - is out of beta testing and available to download on iOS and Android.


Mortal Kombat: Onslaught&#x27;s big selling point is its &quot;mobile-exclusive&quot; story - promising &quot;high quality graphics, cinematic cutscenes, and bone-krushing kombat&quot; - that&#x27;ll see players joining forces with Raiden in a bid to prevent fallen Elder God Shinnok from gathering relics and regaining his evil powers. All that plays out through &quot;massive real-time group battles&quot;, featuring up to ten fighters at once, that&#x27;ll require players to tailor their team of four champions to take on progressively more difficult challenges.


More specifically, progress involves collecting and assembling a team from a &quot;massive&quot; catalogue of Assassins, Warriors, Snipers, and Defenders - including the familiar likes of Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, Scorpion, and Kitana, plus &quot;rare, fan-favourite variants&quot; such as Cyrax and Smoke. Each comes with its own unique Special Moves, Affinities and Passive Skills, and players will need to evolve their characters&#x27; combat skills, level their gear, and equip Relics.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a new King Kong game out right now, but you might not have known about it. Developer IguanaBee and publisher GameMill Entertainment have remained silent on social platforms about the game, despite the fact it only released earlier today.
The reason for that may be the state of the game at release. Full walkthroughs and cutscene footage have been shared on social media and are gaining traction for the game&#x27;s poor quality.
IguanaBee is a small studio based in Chile which developed party game Headsnatchers and third person shooter G.I. Joe: Operation Blackout. GameMill Entertainment is a company which has published games for franchises through licensing deals. Its most successfully published title is Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, which a sequel is in development for.

Rhys-Davies, who played Lord Gimli Lockbearer in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy, will once again voice the dwarven hero, as he is providing his vocal stylings to the upcoming co-op survival crafting title.


&quot;It&#x27;s always fun to come back and think of the &#x27;what-ifs&#x27;, and the chance to work on this game is an exploration of one of the what-ifs, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Rhys-Davies said of his inclusion in the game.

Epic only acquired Bandcamp, the self-styled &quot;online record store and music community&quot;, last year. As we reported back in 2022, the Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer said this acquisition was all part of its vision to build out a &quot;creator marketplace ecosystem&quot;. Its subsequent sale to Songtradr was then announced last month.


In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Epic confirmed the recent Bandcamp layoffs were part of its previous wave of cuts, which were announced at the end of September.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 is a mere few days away from release and the reviews and impressions have started rolling in across the web (no pun intended, but isn&#x27;t it nice when it just happens). Many have praised the game&#x27;s action, slick traversal and story, but one area that has been highlighted away from your typical professional assessment is the puddles. 

Some players felt the first Spider-Man game was lacking in the puddle density department, noting the game&#x27;s E3 2017 gameplay trailer had larger and better defined puddles than in the released version. This caused quite a stir on social media and was eventually dubbed &quot;puddlegate&quot;.

Insomniac took this all in its stride, and actually added a playful fix for Spider-Man&#x27;s puddlegate in the form of puddle stickers. However, it&#x27;s already clear its sequel won&#x27;t need stickers to &#x27;fix&#x27; its puddles, as they are looking pretty dense and wet from where I am sitting.

                              <span>A video purporting to show an unused post-credits scene found within the files of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage may point to a seismic upcoming shift in series&#x27; story.


Filenames for the scene reference &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Neo&quot;, an internal Ubisoft codename believed to refer to one of several upcoming projects currently in development. Thus, the big twist revealed here is expected to be something we see more of in future games. 


For those who&#x27;d rather be left unspoiled, this is your last chance to turn away now.

                              <span>Following Epic&#x27;s announcement in August it would give third-party developers 100 percent of revenue for six months of Epic Games Store exclusivity on new games, the company - which laid off 16% of its workforce earlier this month - is now attempting to get developers on its storefront by promising 100% revenue on their back catalogue titles.


Today marks the official launch of the company&#x27;s Epic First Run scheme, described as an &quot;opt-in exclusivity program for third-party developers and publishers&quot; that promises to boost Epic&#x27;s usual 88% revenue cut for developers all the way up to 100% if they agree to keep their new game exclusive to the Epic Games Store for the first sixth months of release.


And the company is now complementing that offer by pledging to give developers - in a scheme it&#x27;s calling Now On Epic - a six-month 100% revenue cut for bringing over games &quot;currently live on another third-party PC store or included in a third-party subscription service available on another third-party PC store&quot;. Games must have been released on other storefronts before 31st October this year, and after six months of being on the Epic Games Store, revenue reverts to Epic&#x27;s standard 88%/12% split.

Payday 3 got off to a wobbly start in September, with the game drawing criticism for its matchmaking issues, its online-only requirements (proving particularly irksome for solo players forced into lengthy queues), and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system.


Matchmaking has now been improved, and Starbreeze has pledged at least &quot;some changes&quot; to progression, but Payday 3&#x27;s first patch is still eagerly awaited given that it promises some &quot;200+&quot; quality of life improvements for all platforms.

                              <span>Ahead of Cities: Skylines 2&#x27;s release next week, publisher Paradox Interactive has admitted the city building sequel has &quot;not achieved the [performance] benchmark we targeted&quot;. However, rather than delaying the game to remedy those issues the publisher has decided &quot;releasing now is the best way forward&quot;.


The somewhat astonishing admission was shared in a post on the official Paradox forum, written to address &quot;concerns raised about Cities: Skylines 2 performance&quot; following the publisher&#x27;s decision to increase Cities Skylines 2&#x27;s minimum and recommended specs on PC and to delay the game on Xbox and PS5 into spring next year.


&quot;Cities: Skylines 2 is a next-gen title, and naturally, it demands certain hardware requirements,&quot; the publisher wrote. &quot;With that said, while our team has worked tirelessly to deliver the best experience possible, we have not achieved the benchmark we targeted.&quot;

                              <span>Psychedelic horror Layers of Fear - the 2023 remake as opposed to the 2016 original - is getting a free new story chapter on 24th October to mark developer Bloober Team&#x27;s 15th anniversary.


Layers of Fear (again, the new one) already featured a decent chunk of new content, of course, reconfiguring the stories of Layers of Fear 1 and 2, as well as the first game&#x27;s Inheritance DLC, into a single narrative - all spruced up with striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals and new gameplay elements. And then there&#x27;s a new story chapter featuring the original protagonist&#x27;s wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.


Bloober&#x27;s newly announced Halloween/birthday treat makes yet another tortured artist - joining the Painter, Actor, Musician, and Writer from the base game - playable in Layers of Fear, this time dropping players into the director;s seat as they take the reins of a troubled Hollywood production. &quot;Immerse yourself into the psyche of the movie&#x27;s creator as you seek to complete your final masterpiece,&quot; Bloober teases, &quot;even as the set around you descends into chaos&quot;.

                              <span>Analogue, the boutique console manufacturer known for its work building slick machines capable of playing classic retro cartridges, has announced the Analogue 3D - a &quot;reimagining of the N64&quot; that&#x27;s coming in 2024.


Analogue 3D, which follows the likes of 2021&#x27;s well-regarded Analogue Pocket and the PC-Engine-inspired Analogue Duo, is another FPGA machine, and promises 100% compatibility with N64 games from every region: USA, EU, and Japan.


It can output at 4K resolution, features original display modes, and also includes &quot;reference quality recreations of specific model CRTs and PVMs&quot;.

                              <span>Netflix is reportedly looking to build upon its current, predominantly mobile-focused gaming offerings by introducing &quot;higher-end&quot; titles to its subscription catalogue - and is said to have had discussions about licensing a Grand Theft Auto game as part of the move.


The streaming company took its first tentative steps into gaming back in November 2021, with the release of five iOS and Android titles that could be downloaded and played as part of a Netflix subscription. Since then, its gaming catalogue has swelled to over 70 titles and it&#x27;s made a number notable acquisitions, including Triple Town and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox, The Walking Dead mobile developer Next Games, and Oxenfree creator Night School Studio.


Hints of more ambitious gaming plans at Netflix came with last November&#x27;s announcement the company had set up a new Los Angeles studio - lead by former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny - to create a brand-new triple-A, third-person RPG for PC. And a new report from the Wall Street Journal has shed further light on Netflix plans, saying the company is &quot;taking steps to expand into higher-end games that can be streamed from TVs or PCs.&quot;

Originally announced at TwitchCon Paris, the feature works a bit like social media posts to allow streamers to create community with their followers even when not live.


The Stories shelf will appear at the top of the Following page. Creating Stories is currently limited to Partners and Affiliates who have streamed at least once in the past 30 days.

                              <span>Online voting is insecure, period. This doesn’t stop organizations and governments from using it. (And for low-stakes elections, it’s probably fine.) Switzerland—not low stakes—uses online voting for national elections. Ed Appel explains why it’s a bad idea:
Last year, I published a 5-part series about Switzerland’s e-voting system. Like any internet voting system, it has inherent security vulnerabilities: if there are malicious insiders, they can corrupt the vote count; and if thousands of voters’ computers are hacked by malware, the malware can change votes as they are transmitted. Switzerland “solves” the problem of malicious insiders in their printing office by officially declaring that they won’t consider that threat model in their cybersecurity assessment...</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Go has now fully detailed Party Play, a major new multiplayer layer coming to the popular monster collection app seven years after its initial release.


Party Play is designed to reward groups of people playing alongside each other in the real world, with gameplay bonuses, extra challenges and the ability to see each others&#x27; avatars in-game on Pokémon Go&#x27;s map.


Perhaps most enticing for players is a new Party Power raid bonus, which will double the damage of Charged Attacks in the game&#x27;s popular PVE battles.

In a statement shared on X (formerly Twitter), the now-former head of publishing said he would begin an &quot;exciting new chapter&quot;, which will include &quot;exploring interests and passions, donating my time where I can, and taking more time to enjoy life&quot;.


Hines said this was not a decision he came to easily, but &quot;after an amazing career, culminating in the incredible launch of Starfield, it feels like the time is right.&quot;

                              <span>After Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s much anticipated release in 2020 failed to live up to expectations, the team&#x27;s morale took a &quot;significant hit&quot;. 


That&#x27;s according to Colin Walder, an engineering director at CD Projekt Red with over 15 years of experience in the games industry, who previously worked on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Rockstar titles Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto 5. Walder recently spoke to invenglobal at the Inven Game Conference in South Korea, where he discussed lessons learned from Cyberpunk 2077. 


&quot;This approach we had, the way we were working production-wise, creating demos, and moving towards an agile mindset and workflow - it&#x27;s about ensuring we&#x27;re on top of certain things from the start,&quot; Walder said. &quot;Take consoles, for example; we need to make sure they&#x27;re functioning from the get-go. For our next project, Polaris [part of a new trilogy of games in CDPR&#x27;s Witcher series], we&#x27;re already running our demos and internal reviews on the console from the very beginning.&quot;

                              <span>A group of Just Stop Oil protestors made a scene at EGX yesterday, and interrupted a Tekken esports tournament. 


EGX, the UK&#x27;s biggest games event, ran from Thursday to Sunday last week and is run by Eurogamer&#x27;s parent company Reedpop.


Protestors attempted to squirt orange paint at a screen displaying an in-progress Tekken match, before daubing more on the two players&#x27; screens. They then began a short speech, before being dragged off by security.

                              <span>Matthew Mercer has confirmed he&#x27;s the voice actor behind Vincent Valentine in Square Enix&#x27;s forthcoming Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.


Mercer is known for his part in D&amp;D show Critical Role, as well as voicing countless video game characters: from Ganondorf in Tears of the Kingdom, to McCree in Overwatch, Yusuke in Persona 5, the player character in Destiny 2, Goro Majima in Yakuza: Like A Dragon, and plenty more. In fact, he was already in Final Fantasy 7 Remake playing multiple additional voices.


Mercer made the announcement at New York Comic Con where he hosted a panel of actors from the game: Cody Christian (Cloud Strife), John Eric Bentley (Barret Wallace), Britt Baron (Tifa Lockhart), Max Mittelman (Red XIII) and Suzie Yeung (Yuffie Kisaragi).

                              <span>There won&#x27;t be an English dub for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name on its launch next month. 


As noted by Kiryu&#x27;s English voice actor Yong Yea, an English dub will instead be released as part of a post-launch patch. &quot;Hope you&#x27;ll look forward to it,&quot; Yea wrote on X (formerly Twitter), while highlighting this overlooked detail. 


On its launch, the game will be only playable in Japanese with English subtitles. At the time of writing, there is no release date for Like a Dragon Gaiden&#x27;s English dub patch. We will, of course, update you when we know more.

                              <span>Experimental result:
Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started—Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%.

And the final paragraph:
Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on the outcome of a coin toss (i.e., paying 1 dollar to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6 deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position of the coin is best concealed...</span>
