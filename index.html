The Kubernetes release train rolls on, and we look ahead to the release of 1.23 next week. As is our tradition, I&#x27;m pleased to bring you a look back at the process that brought us the previous version.
The release team for 1.22 was led by Savitha Raghunathan, who was, at the time, a Senior Platform Engineer at MathWorks. I spoke to Savitha on the Kubernetes Podcast from Google, the weekly* show covering the Kubernetes and Cloud Native ecosystem.
Our release conversations shine a light on the team that puts together each Kubernetes release. Make sure you subscribe, wherever you get your podcasts so you catch the story of 1.23.
And in case you&#x27;re interested in why the show has been on a hiatus the last few weeks, all will be revealed in the next episode!

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been playing Jurassic World Evolution 2 and are of the opinion it very much needs more dinosaurs, you&#x27;re in luck. Frontier has announced the park management sim&#x27;s first paid DLC expansion, which introduces four new Early Cretaceous era creatures.
Arriving exactly one month after Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s release, the Early Cretaceous Pack (as the DLC is unfussily known) costs £5.99/€7.99/$7.99 USD and adds two new new land dinosaurs, one new flying reptile, and one new marine reptile - the Wuerhosaurus, Minmi, Dsungaripterus and Kronosaurus respectively.

                    <span>Politicians in the US have announced a new legislative bill - named the Stopping Grinch Bots Act, after the Dr. Seuss character that stole Christmas - which seeks to curtail the scalping of high demand toys and goods.
The bill, which specifically targets scalpers using bots to snap up online inventories of in-demand items in order to resell them at significantly higher prices, doesn&#x27;t limit its focus to the video games industry, but it would certainly cover items such as consoles and graphics cards - both of which have been hit particularly hard by scalping as a result of supply chain issues worsened during the pandemic.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment has announced it&#x27;ll be delisting the original Titanfall from all digital stores starting today, 1st December, although servers will remain online for existing players.
In a statement announcing the news on Twitter, Respawn called Titanfall, which launched for Xbox and PC in 2014, a part of its DNA - a game that &quot;showcased the ambitions of the studio&quot; and one that &quot;continues to be a beacon of innovation that we strive for in all of our games&quot;. Despite its professed fondness for the title, however, it will be delisted on all digital storefronts starting today and will be removed from all subscription services from 1st March next year.

                    <span>Interesting:
Intel’s issue reflects a wider concern: Legacy technology can introduce cybersecurity weaknesses. Tech makers constantly improve their products to take advantage of speed and power increases, but customers don’t always upgrade at the same pace. This creates a long tail of old products that remain in widespread use, vulnerable to attacks.

As part of its third quarter 2021 report, CD Projekt said it&#x27;s currently &quot;hard at work&quot; on Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions - which were originally due to launch this year before the studio made the decision to push their release into early next year - and that these would be accompanied by a &quot;major update&quot; for all platforms.

                    <span>Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s standing on Steam has recently improved - it now has a &quot;Very Positive&quot; user rating and is one of the top-selling games on the platform.
Cyberpunk 2077 suffered a disastrous launch and caused developer CD Projekt severe reputational damage it has yet to recover from. It went so badly, CD Projekt changed how it operates to develop multiple AAA games and expansions in parallel, and only begin promoting its creations much closer to release.

Kubernetes v1.22, released in August 2021, introduced a new alpha feature that improves how Linux nodes implement memory resource requests and limits.
In prior releases, Kubernetes did not support memory quality guarantees.
For example, if you set container resources as follows:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: &quot;64Mi&quot;
        cpu: &quot;250m&quot;
      limits:
        memory: &quot;64Mi&quot;
        cpu: &quot;500m&quot;

spec.containers[].resources.requests(e.g. cpu, memory) is designed for scheduling. When you create a Pod, the Kubernetes scheduler selects a node for the Pod to run on. Each node has a maximum capacity for each of the resource types: the amount of CPU and memory it can…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s not really a new Gran Turismo without a shiny new wheel to accompany it, and for the release of Gran Turismo 7 next year Fanatec is doing the honours and pulling out all the stops as it introduces the first direct drive wheel for PlayStation with the GT DD Pro. 

It&#x27;s a piece of hardware that comes with a considerable cost, with the basic bundle that includes the direct drive hub, the bespoke GT rim and a two pedal setup coming in at 699.95EUR, running up to the premium bundle which includes a three-pedal setup and the Boost Kit 180 which increases the peak torque to 8nm. Which basically means more force feedback.

                    <span>In news that isn&#x27;t particularly surprising but still nice to have confirmed, Capcom has announced the superb Monster Hunter Rise will include all post-launch content so far released for the Switch version when it makes its way to Steam on 12th January.
Since its arrival on Switch back in March, Capcom has released a steady flow of post-launch content for Monster Hunter Rise, ranging from the big stuff - which is to say new creatures and a proper conclusion to the Kamura Village story arc - to fun smaller additions, including a series of &#x27;collaborations&#x27; based on various video game properties.

                    <span>Just under a week after its initial launch - and following a somewhat shaky start - DICE has deployed the first major post-release patch for Battlefield 2042, looking to address some of its many issues. 
While foundational issues such as the lack of a scoreboard or in-game voice chat have been acknowledged, they&#x27;re not part of the first wave of patches. Instead, today&#x27;s update - named update two, following the day one patch that launched a week after the game was widely available (look, video game launches are complicated now) - instead introducing balancing and performance tweaks.

The fire, which had broken out in the ceiling of the ride&#x27;s indoor section, was spotted by a Universal Studios employee late on 23rd November, after guests had left the park for the day. According to the Fuji News Network (thanks Nintendo Life) emergency services were immediately contacted and no-one was harmed in the incident.

                    <span>Nintendo is bringing Mario Golf: Super Rush&#x27;s post-launch support to a close with one final free content update, available now on Switch.
Mario Golf: Super Rush teed off with enough of the good stuff to earn itself a Recommended badge back in June, but its launch line-up was bolstered with a free update in August - introducing Toadette, a New Donk City course, and more - and continued to expand in September, adding Koopa Troopa and Ninji as playable characters, Blustery Basin and Spiky Palms as new stages, alongside various other tweaks and improvements.

True Colours, which released in September on other platforms, is the fourth entry in the acclaimed Life is Strange series, and sees Deck Nine - the studio responsible for Life is Strange prequel Before the Storm - at the helm, taking over from original series developer Dontnod.

                    <span>Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, in which developer Yacht Club Games&#x27; iconic spade-bearer embarks on a colourful blend of falling-block puzzling and dungeon-crawling, finally has a release date and will be making its way to Switch, PlayStation, and PC on 13th December.
Announced back in the early part of 2020, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is a collaboration between Yacht Club Games and developer Vine that trades the titular hero&#x27;s previous bouts of acclaimed platform action for top-down puzzling and adventuring. The goal is to work through each single-screen stage by clearing groups of adjacent enemies - lining them up with a quick spade-thwack to create massive chain attacks - in order to progress to the next area.

                    <span>Fortnite Chapter 3 arrives next month, following a climactic live event to conclude the game&#x27;s second Chapter and wave farewell to its current, ever-changing Island map. 
Epic Games confirmed the timing for this season&#x27;s ending live event this afternoon - and acknowledged it would also bookend the game&#x27;s second Chapter. This backs up earlier rumours reported by Eurogamer that Epic planned to deploy Chapter 3 in December, rather than continuing Chapter 2 into a ninth season.

This week, developer Creative Assembly released a cinematic trailer for upcoming strategy game Total War: Warhammer 3, and it showcased Nurgle in all its puss-packed glory. I must say it&#x27;s just about the best Nurgle has looked in any video game ever.

Expeditions, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, are effectively No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s stab at live-service-style seasonal content, offering limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the game&#x27;s ever-expanding systems into a series of progression-based challenges - with various cosmetic rewards served up as different milestones are reached.

                    <span>Men of War 2, the sequel to the original cult RTS Men of War, has been announced. It&#x27;s coming in 2022, and being developed by Ukrainian studio Best Way, the same studio behind the originals in the series: Men of War, which came out in 2009, and the proper first game in the series, 2004&#x27;s Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2.
We&#x27;ve seen some extended gameplay in action and had a walkthrough of some of the key features, and were pretty impressed with what we saw. In simple terms, imagine a Company of Heroes game with a bit more complexity to its systems (and maybe a smidge less budget).

Harmonix was founded in 1995 and began carving a rhythm-action niche for itself with the 2001 release of celebrated PS2-exclusive Frequency and its much-loved sequel Amplitude. 2005 saw the studio release Guitar Hero, arguably its most impactful game to date, which would go on to spawn a steady succession of sequels - although the developer would soon leave the series behind to expand on Guitar Hero&#x27;s plastic instrument premise with 2007&#x27;s Rock Band.

Party Spectacular, as season six is officially known, brings with it five new rounds, 25 new costumes, and a new 50-tier progression track with associated rewards. There&#x27;s also a special Sackboy-themed limited-time event, the return of custom usernames, the addition of cross-progression between PlayStation and PC, and more.

                    <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 sales aren&#x27;t great and Elite Dangerous: Odyssey under-performed, developer Frontier has said.
In a trading update, the Cambridge-based company said sales of Jurassic World Evolution 2 were &quot;lower than expected&quot; on the PC platform specifically. Frontier believes this is the &quot;short-term effect&quot; of a crowded release window, with a number of other highly-anticipated PC games launching in the same window.

                    <span>A new update for Skyrim Anniversary Edition fixes an issue with black screens.
Unfortunately it also breaks mods. What&#x27;s more, because the recently released Anniversary Edition is actually an upgrade to the previously released Special Edition, the update will affect owners of either version.

                    <span>Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has become the latest to condemn Activision Blizzard in a leaked internal email, following last week&#x27;s bombshell report which detailed allegations of sexual assault, harassment and misconduct at the company. 
Bowser&#x27;s note to employees follows similar emails sent last week by the chiefs of both PlayStation and Xbox, all of which expressed disappointment in Activision Blizzard&#x27;s latest scandal.

If you&#x27;ve yet to experience Rusty Lake&#x27;s deliciously surreal output - a collection of, so far, 15 games, all serving up a darkly atmospheric slice of casual point-and-click puzzling with a room escape slant - they&#x27;re well worth checking out.

                    <span>Rockstar has apologised for the &quot;unexpected&quot; technical issues plaguing its widely lambasted Grand Theft Auto: Trilogy - Definitive Edition release, promising to put the classic versions of the games back on sale on PC and making them free to owners of the remaster.
Rockstar&#x27;s Definitive Edition, developed by Grove Street Games, launched last week and immediately attracted ire for its myriad issues, including progression crashes, a widely documented procession of (admittedly sometimes hilarious) bugs, poor performance across all consoles, and a host of art concerns.

Starting with the free additions, Flight Simulator&#x27;s 1.21.12.0 update introduces a total of five new aircraft, some very different to those seen in the base game. The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, for instance, is Asobo&#x27;s first military jet, while the VoloCity is its first eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, capable of pinpoint landings and described as a taster for the proper arrival of helicopters in Flight Simulator next year.

Speaking to Eurogamer in a new interview, Joseph Staten, Head of Creative at 343 Industries, said the recent extension of Halo Infinite Season 1 to May 2022 means the releases of campaign co-op and Forge mode have also been pushed back from their initial announced target launch windows.

                    <span>Rowhammer is an attack technique involving accessing — that’s “hammering” — rows of bits in memory, millions of times per second, with the intent of causing bits in neighboring rows to flip. This is a side-channel attack, and the result can be all sorts of mayhem.
Well, there is a new enhancement:
All previous Rowhammer attacks have hammered rows with uniform patterns, such as single-sided, double-sided, or n-sided. In all three cases, these “aggressor” rows — meaning those that cause bitflips in nearby “victim” rows — are accessed the same number of times. ...</span>

                    <span>Cult classic platform star Earthworm Jim, first seen on Super Nintendo and Mega Drive back in the early 90s, is returning to television in a brand-new animated series.
As those of a certain age may recall, Earthworm Jim&#x27;s early video game success saw the space-faring invertebrate make the jump to television once before, way back in the mists of 1995 with an animated TV show that ran for two seasons and 23 episodes.

                    <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has written to staff saying he is &quot;evaluating all aspects&quot; of Xbox&#x27;s relationship with Activision Blizzard in light of a damning Wall Street Journal report claiming Activision CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.
In an email seen by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier - and later confirmed by Microsoft in a statement to IGN - Spencer told Xbox employees he and the gaming leadership team were &quot;disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions&quot; at Activision Blizzard, and that &quot;this type of behaviour has no place in our industry&quot;.

                    <span>Ninja Theory&#x27;s acclaimed 2017 action-adventure, Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice, has just received a new update, bringing August&#x27;s Xbox Series X enhancements over to PC. Additionally, a range of new accessibility features have been introduced to both versions.
The official description for Hellblade&#x27;s PC enhancements is a little vague, with Ninja Theory only promising &quot;enriched visuals&quot;, alongside DirectX Raytracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and AMD FSR support. However, the new PC release will almost certainly reflect the Xbox Series X version, which introduced the likes of upgraded materials, particles, and draw distances.

                    <span>Sifu, the striking martial arts adventure from Absolver developer Sloclap, will be making its way to PlayStation and PC a little sooner than expected. Its arrival date has been revised to 8th February, a few weeks earlier than its originally anticipated 22nd February release.
Announcing the revised launch, Absolver explained it wanted to get Sifu into players hands a little sooner so they &quot;can enjoy playing [it] ahead of an incredibly big month for highly anticipated AAA releases&quot;. If Sifu had stuck to its original release date it would have been jostling up against the likes of Destiny 2&#x27;s The Witch Queen expansion, Horizon: Forbidden West, and the mighty Elden Ring.

                    <span>Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy, a surprisingly competent game for many, just got a heap of improvements with the latest update from Eidos-Montréal. 
Most notably, the update brings a ray-tracing mode to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and a hidden save rollback feature  to allow users who have encountered blocking issues to rollback to the start of the chapter of their choice (here&#x27;s how you can do it).

While those who have played Battlefield 2042 early have reported a more stable experience than the open beta, the game is still mired with bugs and glitches.

                    <span>Developer Mojang has announced that the long-awaited second part of Minecraft&#x27;s ambitious Caves &amp; Cliffs update will finally launch on 30th November for the Java and Bedrock editions of the game - meaning it&#x27;ll be coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4,  Switch, iOS, Android, Windows 10, Windows 11, MacOS, and Linux.
Minecraft&#x27;s Caves &amp; Cliffs update, you may recall, was initially unveiled during last October&#x27;s Minecon, with Mojang promising the likes of new cave types - complete with fresh blocks, mobs, and items - underground lakes and waterfalls to raft down, a new archaeology system, and, above ground, significantly more mountainous cliffs, complete with goats.

According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Ryan shared the email earlier today following the recent report by the Wall Street Journal which claimed Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick had known about alleged instances of sexual assault and harassment within his company for years, but had failed to fully act upon them.

Inspired by Steve Purcell&#x27;s cult comic series and first released in 2007, Beyond Time and Space once against follows the largely ludicrous adventures of crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam &amp; Max - who both made their video game debut 15 years earlier in LucasArts&#x27; point-and-click classic Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road - over the course of five episodes.

Eligible users should look for the cloud icon on supported titles in their console&#x27;s Game Pass catalogue. If present, a cloud version of the game can be launched for immediate play - perhaps to sample its wares or to quickly join a friend&#x27;s gaming session - without needing to download it first. Microsoft calls it a &quot;great way to discover your next favourite game while saving space on your hard drive for the games you plan to play again and again.&quot;

                    <span>AWS offers its usual re:Invent justification letter to get your boss to let you attend re:Invent. As per my annual re:Quinnvent tradition, I’ve modified it slightly and sent it to my business partner: Dearest Mike Julian, I’d like your blessing and permission to attend AWS re:Invent 2021, Nov. 29 – Dec. 3 in Las Vegas.

                    <span>I received email from two people who told me that Microsoft Edge enabled synching without warning or consent, which means that Microsoft sucked up all of their bookmarks. Of course they can turn synching off, but it’s too late.
Has this happened to anyone else, or was this user error of some sort? If this is real, can some reporter write about it?
(Not that “user error” is a good justification. Any system where making a simple mistake means that you’ve forever lost your privacy isn’t a good one. We see this same situation with sharing contact lists with apps on smartphones. Apps will repeatedly ask, and only need you to accidentally click “okay” once.)...</span>

                    <span>As part of its Q3 interim report, publisher Paradox Interactive has offered an update on the beleaguered Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, saying it&#x27;s &quot;happy with the progress&quot; being made by the game&#x27;s still unknown new developer, but that it won&#x27;t be in a position to provide an updated release date for &quot;quite some time&quot;.
Back in October, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester admitted the publisher had almost scrapped Bloodlines 2 completely after its incredibly troubled development, which has seen the project hit with multiple delays and other controversies since its announcement back in 2019 - a sequence of events that ultimately lead to original developer Hardsuit Labs being removed from the project earlier this year.

As the agency describes it, the scammer will contact their victim and somehow convince them that they need to send money, either with promises of love, further riches, or by impersonating an actual institution like a bank or utility company. After the mark is convinced, the scammer will have them get cash (sometimes out of investment or retirement accounts), and head to an ATM that sells cryptocurrencies and supports reading QR codes. Once the victim’s there, they’ll scan a QR code that the scammer sent them, which will tell the machine to send any crypto purchased to the scammer’s address.

Which was rejected by the site, because it didn’t meet their password security rules.
It took me a minute to figure out what was wrong with it. They wanted at least two numbers.

                    <span>Battlefield is used to a bit of chaos - it&#x27;s at the series&#x27; core, after all, with manic moments in its sandbox what makes it stand out from other shooters - but the disarray of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s first weekend in the wilds has been hugely frustrating. Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I&#x27;ve endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable. This is another Battlefield that&#x27;s launching in a sorry state, and it&#x27;s up there with Battlefield 4&#x27;s infamously sorry start. From my own experience on Xbox Series X, it&#x27;s considerably worse. 
A lot of that frustration stems from setting aside Friday night to get stuck into DICE&#x27;s new shooter only to spend the whole evening butting up against a data persistent error that was, shall we say, persistent - across a whole night it was impossible to get into a single match of the All-Out Warfare that&#x27;s the core of this new Battlefield experience, and only the classic matches and rulesets of Portal offered any joy.

                    <span>Rockstar pulled Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition from sale on PC to &quot;remove files unintentionally included&quot;, it&#x27;s admitted.
This week the PC version launched exclusively on the Rockstar Games Launcher. Soon after, the Rockstar Games Launcher went offline, making Rockstar&#x27;s PC games played through it unplayable. In the same breath, Rockstar removed the ability to buy the PC version of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition from its website.

Last year we announced that Dockershim is being deprecated: Dockershim Deprecation FAQ.
Our current plan is to remove dockershim from the Kubernetes codebase soon.
We are looking for feedback from you whether you are ready for dockershim
removal and to ensure that you are ready when the time comes.
Please fill out this survey: https://forms.gle/svCJmhvTv78jGdSx8.
The dockershim component that enables Docker as a Kubernetes container runtime is
being deprecated in favor of runtimes that directly use the Container Runtime Interface
created for Kubernetes. Many Kubernetes users have migrated to

                    <span>Star Wars&#x27; iconic bounty hunter Boba Fett is the latest character to up sticks and tumble awkwardly from the comfortable surroundings of their own franchise into the gaping, metaversal maw of Fortnite, and will be doing so this December.
More specifically, Boba Fett - real name Bob Feet - will be joining Fortnite in the form of a new skin on 24th December at 4pm PT, or at the stroke of midnight on 25th December if you happen to be in the UK. All very festive, but it could certainly be more so.

                    <span>The New War, free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe&#x27;s highly anticipated new story expansion will launch simultaneously on all platforms this December, Digital Extremes has announced.
Unveiled during this year&#x27;s TennoCon fan event (but teased back in 2018), The New War is described as Warfare&#x27;s &quot;biggest narrative expansion...so far&quot;, telling the story of a massive Sentient invasion from the perspective of multiple playable characters - including a Grineer Lancer called Kahl-175, Corpus engineer Veso, and Conclave Master Teshin. Digital Extremes has previously called The New War, the &quot;most ambitious thing we&#x27;ve done&quot;.

The new locations popped up early last week, and come from the wider database of approved locations used by developer Niantic&#x27;s earlier game Ingress. (Pokémon Go has specific rules to limit the number of locations which filter through to it, to space out places on its map.)

It was fab and much-missed, and if a new report is to be believed, is now &quot;definitely&quot; set to make a a comeback.
That&#x27;s according to journalist (and reliable rumour-smith) Jeff Grubb, who discussed a new in-development take on 1 vs 100 as part of his Giant Bomb show. As reported by VGC, Grubb claimed the new project will be developed by Altspace VR - part of Microsoft&#x27;s Mixed Reality division - and will utilise the 3D avatars recently revealed for Microsoft Teams.

The sites served both iOS and MacOS exploit chains, but the researchers were only able to retrieve the MacOS one.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but Spider-Man is finally set to make his Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; debut - exclusively on PlayStation consoles, of course - at the end of this month, and developer Crystal Dynamics has offered a first proper look at the beleaguered live service game&#x27;s take on the character in a new cinematic trailer.
Spider-Man, who arrives somewhat later than his initially announced &quot;early&quot; 2021 release date, will make his Marvel&#x27;s Avenger&#x27;s debut alongside a new hero event, titled With Great Power, which sees Spidey joining forces with Black Widow and Ms. Marvel to try to stop a nefarious new AIM plan.

Make It Count adds new boss Maxim Zelnick, known as the Mob&#x27;s Fixer, to the existing 14-strong roster, alongside a range of other gameplay additions. Loan Sharks are in as a new racket type, for instance, providing a potentially lucrative new passive source of income - and potential new event-based complications if customers can&#x27;t afford afford to repay loans.

                    <span>YouTube has announced plans to hide the dislike count for videos, and is now slowly rolling out the change across its platform.

                    <span>Sony has reportedly reduced its production forecast for the PlayStation 5 again because of &quot;component and logistics constraints&quot;.
Sony had previously targeted more than 16m units assembled in the year ending March, but that has now been cut to 15m units, according to Bloomberg sources. This will make its target of 14.8m PS5 sales by March more difficult.

                    <span>Some cheats have been removed from the GTA&#x27;s remastered trilogy due to technical reasons.
Back in the day, players had plenty of fun with cheat codes in the original games, from adding infinite health, to netting a bank load of cash, and even tanks falling from the skies.

&quot;You know, it&#x27;s great to have celebrities, it&#x27;s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,&quot; Keighley said. &quot;What we really learned last year was at the end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.&quot;

                    <span>After months of rumours, the world of Naruto has now been officially confirmed as coming to Fortnite.
The enormously-popular anime has long been top of fans&#x27; wishlists for characters to include in Epic&#x27;s battle royale. Earlier this year, rumours persisted that Epic was attempting to negotiate the rights - and that at one point Mr. Naruto himself was part of a seasonal battle pass.

                    <span>Image &amp; Form is returning to its critically acclaimed SteamWorld universe with SteamWorld Headhunter, a brand-new new co-operative action-adventure that sees the series moving into 3D for the very first time. But that&#x27;s not all! The developer has also announced a release date for its gloopy third-person sci-fi adventure, The Gunk, which will be heading to Xbox One, Xbox One Series X/S, and PC on 16th December.
SteamWorld Headhunter, to deal with the newcomer first, is the sixth entry in Image &amp; Form&#x27;s celebrated SteamWorld series - following on from SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Heist, SteamWorld Dig 2, and SteamWorld Quest - and once again looks to offer a radical shake-up for the series.

                    <span>Valve has announced a delay for Steam Deck; the portable gaming PC will no longer begin shipping at the end of this year as intially planned, and will now start making its way to customers in February 2022.
Those that successfully managed to surmount some early technical hitches and join the front of the queue when Steam Deck reservations opened back in July were originally due to receive their hardware in December this year. Unfortunately, those Christmases will now be just a little less merry thanks to disruptions in production caused by a lack of available parts.

All three GTA titles included in the remaster bundle have, of course, been impacted by music licensing issues in the past, leading to a number of tracks being omitted when the games were later re-released for iOS and Android, PS3 and PS4, and PC.

The two exploits are particularly notable due to the level of access they theoretically give to the PS5’s software.

The user/group ID related security settings in Pod&#x27;s securityContext trigger a problem when users want to
deploy containers that use accelerator devices (via Kubernetes Device Plugins) on Linux. In this blog
post I talk about the problem and describe the work done so far to address it. It&#x27;s not meant to be a long story about getting the k/k issue fixed.
Instead, this post aims to raise awareness of the issue and to highlight important device use-cases too. This is needed as Kubernetes works on new related features such as support for user namespaces.
Why non-root containers can&#x27;t use devices and why it matters
One of the key security principles for running containers in Kubernetes is the
principle of least privilege. The Pod/container securityContext specifies …</span>

                    <span>As one of Bethesda&#x27;s biggest and most beloved series, it&#x27;s not much of a revelation to hear the company is already mulling over a new Fallout instalment, but studio director Todd Howard has now talked a little about a potential new series entry, confirming that while an idea exists, Fallout 5 is still a long way off.
Speaking to IGN as part of a Skyrim 10th anniversary retrospective, Howard explained that currently the studio has a &quot;one-pager&quot; for Fallout 5, outlining what it wants to do with the series. However, sci-fi adventure Starfield, due to release next year, and The Elder Scrolls 6 - which was still in its design phase as of June this year - remain the studio&#x27;s priority, meaning it could be years before work on the next Fallout begins in earnest.

The 2021 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 4 of which were up for election in 2021. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.
This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Results
Congratulations to the elected committee members whose two year terms begin immediately (listed in alphabetical order by GitHub handle):

                    <span>Developer Turtle Rock has released a fresh post-launch content roadmap for its well-received co-op zombie shooter Back 4 Blood, promising a host of new features into 2022, including a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression before this year is through.
Back 4 Blood, you might recall, came in for criticism on release when players discovered its unwavering always-online requirements, even when playing solo with AI teammates. Worse, restrictions to solo mode meant players wishing to go it alone were prevented from earning progress towards Accomplishments, earning Supply Points, and even tracking stats. Following player feedback, Turtle Rock wrote, &quot;We have heard your frustrations about progression in solo mode and are discussing ways to address the issue&quot;.

                    <span>Pokémon Smile, the augmented reality smartphone app designed to encourage children to brush their teeth, has just received its first ever content update, almost 18 months after its initial launch back in June last year.
Pokémon Smile, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tasks users with rescuing Pokémon from &quot;cavity causing bacteria&quot; - by brushing their actual teeth with an actual brush - all while wearing a special AR hat. Any Pokémon saved from calamity are popped in a Pokédex, and there&#x27;s a photo and sticker element for those really into the whole thing.

                    <span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has finally been given a long-awaited - and desperately needed - shot in the arm, courtesy of Nintendo&#x27;s 2.0 update which, somewhat unexpectedly, arrived earlier today. We already knew it was going to be a big one, of course, but we now have a much clearer idea of just how big it actually is, with data miners having successfully unearthed and catalogued a whopping 9,000+ new items as part of the update.
Granted, a fair few of those items - as datamined by NWPlayer123, Trundler, and VillagerDB, and shared by AnimalCrossingWorld - are colour variations, but even taking those into account, it&#x27;s still a mammoth set of additions, covering clothing items, furniture, a multitude of different light fixtures, cooking apparatus, and more.

The Jinx crossover gets underway today, and - as is now very much the norm in the ever-revolving advertising billboard that is Fortnite&#x27;s Metaversal world - will take the form of a purchasable skin in the shooter&#x27;s Item Shop.

                    <span>Almost exactly 15 months after it was revealed Spider-Man would be heading to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive playable character, developer Crystal Dynamics has announced a release date for the much-delayed hero; he&#x27;ll be swinging into action on 30th November as part of a relatively beefy update for the beleaguered live service game.
Spider-Man was originally due to arrive &quot;early&quot; 2021, but players began to wonder if something was seriously amiss when the character, having failed to materialise in that initial launch window, was conspicuously absent from a development roadmap stretching all the way into &quot;summer and beyond&quot;. Crystal Dynamics eventually moved to reassure fans that Spidey was still coming but his exact arrival date remained unclear - until now.

The developer&#x27;s monthly active users (MAUs) total was down 13 percent year-on-year, to 26 million players. That&#x27;s despite the recent launch of Diablo 2: Resurrected in September. Indeed, that figure means Blizzard has overall shed a million active users since May, and three million total since the quarter before that, when it was at 29 million.

                    <span>Jen Oneal, who joined Blizzard as new co-leader back in August, has announced she&#x27;s stepping down from the role and will leave Activision at the end of the year to explore &quot;how I can do more to have games and diversity intersect&quot;.
Oneal, formerly the boss of Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy studio Vicarious Visions, was hired as Blizzard co-leader alongside Mike Ybarra following the departure of Blizzard president J. Allen Brack - who left amid the fallout from the State of California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, discrimination, and a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture at the company.

After delegating a whole range of operational decisions to AWS, we are free, we’re told, to focus on our application logic while AWS tries to make the supporting machinery as transparent as possible.

A Harvard spokesperson said that the university is working to crack down on the fake students and other scammers that have gained access to its site.

                    <span>Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics are removing Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; controversial progression boosts from sale today as a &quot;first step in rebuilding [players&#x27;] confidence in us as a team&quot;.
Square faced a furious backlash from Avengers players last month after it began selling XP booster &quot;consumables&quot; in the game&#x27;s real-money store, despite pre-launch promises it would only ever monetise cosmetics.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard has announced Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 will now arrive later &quot;than originally envisaged&quot;, potentially pushing the launch of both titles into 2023 at the earliest.
&quot;As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves,&quot; the publisher explained in its Q3 2021 earning report, &quot;particularly in certain key creative roles, it has become apparent that some of the Blizzard content planned for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential.&quot;

                    <span>Following several months of limited testing in select European territories, Netflix is rolling out its fledging video games service to all subscribers around the world (as long as they have an Android device), starting today, 2nd November.
Netflix announced it was &quot;in the early stages&quot; of expanding into games back in July, explaining it would initially focus on titles for mobile devices. Two such games - Stranger Things: 1984 and Stranger Things 3 - were added to its entertainment library in August as part of an early Poland-exclusive test, and  three more - Shooting Hoops, Teeter (Up), and Card Blast - were introduced during a wider test in September.

                    <span>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, developer Niantic&#x27;s magical spin on the Pokémon Go formula, will permanently shut down on 31st January 2022.
Wizards Unite arrived with much fanfare back June 2019, presenting a more narrative-focused take on the hugely popular location-based AR action of Pokémon Go as Harry Potter seeped into the real-world. And now, nearly two and a half years on, that adventure is almost at an end.
