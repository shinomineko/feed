                              <span>Another Thursday means another glimpse ahead at the Epic Games Store&#x27;s next set of weekly freebies, with Evil Dead: The Game and tactical turn-based RPG Dark Deity both now confirmed to be free from Thurday, 17th November.


Evil Dead: The Game, which released as an Epic exclusive back in May, is developer Saber Interactive&#x27;s spin on the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre. It sees four human Survivors (picking from a range of familiar Evil Dead characters, armed with everything from chainsaws to boomsticks) roaming a spooky forest in search of artefacts, while a fifth player gives chase as one of four powerful demons - the Warlord, Puppeteer, Necromancer, or Plaguebringer, all able to command undead armies of their own.


And it&#x27;s good fun, effectively marrying the gleefully cartoonish horror of Sam Raimi&#x27;s beloved franchise to a solidly entertaining multiplayer game.

Announced back in June, Dragon Age: Absolution takes place in Tevinter - the setting for developer BioWare&#x27;s highly anticipated next video game instalment, Dragon Age Dreadwolf - and stars a cast of fresh faces, including protagonist Miriam.


&quot;With great power at stake, a group of mages, fighters, and thieves goes head to head against a sinister force possessing a dangerous artifact,&quot; Netflix teases beneath its newly released Absolution trailer. &quot;Fear. Guilt. Pain. Can Miriam push aside her feelings to complete her mission - or will the trauma looming over her past finally catch up with her?&quot;.

The studio made the announcement in its latest developer update, which highlights some of the new additions coming to Battlefield 2042 as part of Season 3 and beyond.


Season 3, which is yet to receive an official start date, includes a new multiplayer map, a new Specialist, new weapons - including Bad Company 2&#x27;s XM8 and Battlefield 3&#x27;s A-91 - plus a new Battle Pass. It&#x27;ll also usher in map reworks for Manifest and Breakaway.

Blood Origin isn&#x27;t Netflix&#x27;s first Witcher prequel, of course; last year saw the streaming service release an animated movie called The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, focusing on Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s friend and mentor Vesemir.


Blood Origin, though, goes some considerable way further back in the series&#x27; timeline, telling a story set 1,200 years before Geralt and the events we&#x27;re familiar with from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s books, CD Projekt&#x27;s games, and Netflix&#x27;s existing TV show.

                              <span>Mick Gordon, known for his work on soundtracks for several games including the Wolfenstein and Doom series, has released a statement in response to accusations made against him by Marty Stratton in May 2020.

In April 2020, Gordon distanced himself from the soundtrack album for Doom Eternal after it received criticisms from fans on its quality. This led to speculation from fans about its production, and Stratton, who was working as executive producer on Doom Eternal, posted an open letter to the Doom subreddit to address rumours. 

A year and a half later, Gordon has written a lengthy statement rebutting Stratton&#x27;s claims, with screenshots of emails and legal documents (with sensitive information removed) as evidence of the true timeline of events. He posted his statement on Medium, in which he alleged abusive behaviour and manipulation by Stratton. Gordon stated he has released it to defend himself, and urged people to not use it as an excuse for a hate campaign.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing the now-widespread leaks of new Pokémon designs from the upcoming Scarlet and Violet games.

Pokémon details always leak - often months before launch, but especially in the last few weeks as retail copies begin appearing in the wild. Should you look at spoilers? For some, uncovering the many unannounced creatures as they play is a core part of the games. For others, knowing what your new Starter Pokémon will eventually evolve into is a big deal.  
Whichever side of the debate you&#x27;re on, there&#x27;s no doubting the level of interest in new Pokémon designs - seen this week when the final evolution of Starter cat creature Sprigatito sparked an avalanche of dubious fanart after an image was posted by a leaker. Joining me this week to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Yesterday, Call of Duty developer Infinity Ward detailed what&#x27;s in store for players when its free-to-play Warzone 2.0 launches alongside Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s first season on 16th November.


This included a little bit more on its brand-new &quot;experience&quot; known as DMZ.


This Escape From Tarkov-inspired mode is described as an &quot;open-world, narrative-focused extraction mode where Operator squads have free rein to complete faction-based missions, take on additional side objectives, engage with enemy Operators or AI combatants, and search for valuable items, all while fighting to survive toward exfiltration&quot;.

                              <span>Iconic Halo map Blood Gulch has been recreated in the game&#x27;s new Forge mode, just hours after its official beta went live. 


The long-awaited Forge offering officially arrived yesterday as part of Halo Infinite&#x27;s Winter Update, and of course Blood Gulch was one of the first things on anyone&#x27;s mind to recreate.


Halo fan Epsilon_church_ posted word of their creation to Twitter yesterday evening and invited others to try the map for themselves. Amusingly, however, it needed to be named &quot;Coagulation&quot;, as &quot;BloodGulch&quot; was blocked.

                              <span>Google has begun the long process of refunding all Stadia customers for their hardware, games and in-game purchases - something it hopes to have completed by 18th January 2023, the date Stadia servers are switched off. 


A detailed FAQ page on the process is now available for Stadia customers to browse, but in a nutshell it boils down to: sit tight. 


Google will attempt to refund you for most things you bought to do with Stadia - except for the Stadia Pro subscription. It&#x27;ll keep your money for that.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Sony gave its PlayStation Plus subscription service a makeover, adding three new tiers for users to pick between. 


The cheapest of these tiers is Essential and is basically what PlayStation Plus once was. Users get online play, some other smaller perks and free PlayStation titles every month. Then we have Extra. This middle-ground tier includes everything that comes with Essential, but with the bonus of a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games to have a go at.


Then, finally, we have the most expensive of these tiers, known as Premium. This was marketed as a way for users to replay some of PlayStation&#x27;s classic games from days gone by. The service covers every PlayStation console - from the original PS1 through to the PS5, as well as the PSP and, thanks to streaming, PS3 support.

The blue blur is known for going really fast, so it&#x27;s appreciated that the developers took care to not let that negatively affect players.


Producer Sachiko Kawamura told Famitsu that the QA team were integral to this process and that it was important to take this aspect of the game seriously (thanks Siliconera).

                              <span>Twitter users are using the platform&#x27;s new Elon Musk era changes to impersonate official video game companies. 


For a small fee, anyone can now pay up and receive a blue Twitter verified tick next to their name. So, of course, people are handing over their $8 specifically in order to trick others online.


A verified &quot;Nintendo of America&quot; account went viral last night as it posted an image of the company&#x27;s mascot Mario giving the middle finger. The handle, @nIntendoofus, has now had their account suspended - but not until their tweets had been widely shared.

                              <span>Activision has shared a whole load of information on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0&#x27;s first season ahead of its arrival next Wednesday, 16th November, including details of a major battle pass overhaul.


Ditching the linear level progression still used by most games, Call of Duty&#x27;s new battle pass will adopt a system reminiscent of that seen in Fortnite, where players have more freedom in which battle pass items they can unlock and when.


Activision&#x27;s battle pass overhaul presents itself as a multi-sector map, with players able to unlock five items in each of its 20 sectors using earned Battle Token Tier skips. These tokens can either unlock more items within an already available sector or unlock adjacent sectors.

Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari, nonprofit Firefox and others allow the company, TrustCor Systems, to act as what’s known as a root certificate authority, a powerful spot in the internet’s infrastructure that guarantees websites are not fake, guiding users to them seamlessly.
The company’s Panamanian registration records show that it has the identical slate of officers, agents and partners as a spyware maker identified this year as an affiliate of Arizona-based Packet Forensics, which public contracting records and company documents show has sold communication interception services to U.S. government agencies for more than a decade...</span>

                              <span>20 months after developer SCS announced American Truck Simulator was setting its sights on Texas as one of its next destinations, the long-in-the-works expansion finally has a release date and is coming to Steam next Tuesday, 15th November.


Texas will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 11th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It was confirmed to be in development last March, but SCS warned the expansion could be a long time coming given the sheer effort required to bring one of the US&#x27; largest states into the game.


However, with Texas&#x27; arrival now less than a week away, SCS has given us our best look yet at the expansion&#x27;s numerous familiar sights - its newly released  launch trailer featuring the likes of Austin, Houston, and a whole lot of countryside.

There&#x27;s a lot more where that came from though, with Nintendo choosing to highlight over 20 promising new indie titles heading to Switch before next summer is through - a few of which, such as the wonderful Rogue Legacy 2, are out today. Read on for the full round-up!

                              <span>Disco Elysium game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have published an explosive open letter to fans detailing their ousting from ZA/UM, the game&#x27;s development studio.
Most eye-opening is the claim ZA/UM&#x27;s new majority shareholder, an Estonian firm named Tütreke OÜ, allegedly obtained control of the company through fraud. Tütreke OÜ is a &quot;vehicle&quot; for two Estonian businessmen, the pair wrote, namely Ilmar Kompus (now ZA/UM&#x27;s CEO) and Tõnis Haavel (who was previously &quot;convicted for defrauding investors on a different matter in 2007&quot;).


At the same time, ZA/UM CEO Kompus has published, via Estonian newspaper Ekspress, allegations of mismanagement by Kurvitz and a previous minority shareholder of the company, Saandar Taal. The pair are accused of &quot;belittling women and co-workers&quot; and creating a &quot;toxic environment&quot;. Kompus also states the pair had been &quot;intending to steal IP&quot; - namely, Disco Elysium - with an eye to departing the studio and working elsewhere.

                              <span>Ten months after Bandai Namco pulled online support for its Dark Souls trilogy on PC, online services for Dark Souls Remastered - the only series entry yet to be addressed by the publisher - have finally been restored.


Servers for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, and Dark Souls 3 were &quot;temporarily deactivated&quot; back in January following reports the games were vulnerable to Remote Code Execution exploits began to make headlines.


Several weeks later, Bandai Namco offered an update, saying the issue would&#x27;t be addressed until after the release of Elden Ring, but Dark Souls fans&#x27; patience was finally rewarded in August when online features for Dark Souls 3 were restored. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin followed in October, with the publisher promising to reactive servers for the original Dark Souls 2 at &quot;a later date&quot;.

                              <span>Remember Saints Row? The wacky open world reboot launched at the end of August to a lukewarm response. This month, developer Volition has a big patch ready to address hundreds of issues. 

This is the game&#x27;s first major update which Volition previously said would be used to prioritise fixes and improvements over new content. Last month, the studio said it had chosen to spend time bringing the existing game up to scratch - even though it would have &quot;preferred to be talking about roadmaps and expansions&quot;.

&quot;Significant effort and testing&quot; has gone into fixing the game&#x27;s co-op, Volition said today. Connectivity, map issues and rewards should all work more smoothly post-patch.

                              <span>Ahead of its release next summer, Final Fantasy 16 has received plenty of praise for its colossal Eikon battles between mythical beasts, stunning fantasy realm, and fast-paced action full of spectacular magical effects.


But one major criticism has been the distinct lack of diversity in its main cast.


Last week, director Naoki Yoshida addressed the lack of diversity in an interview. It fits the &quot;isolated nature of this realm&quot; he said, as well as the inspiration of Medieval Europe.

                              <span>Nothing can stop the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet leaks - not least the dozens and dozens of Pokémon fans already turning the game&#x27;s latest still-officially-unannounced creature into somewhat dubious fan art.


If you ever need reminding how popular Pokémon is, simply type one of the creatures&#x27; names into social media and see how many image results you get. This is true even for Pokémon so far only glimpsed in leaked screenshots from early copies, images of which Nintendo is busy scrubbing from the internet.


Fan art created from seeing these leaked images, though, is another matter. For example, this morning I learned the final evolution of Grass-type cat and Scarlet and Violet Starter Pokémon Sprigatito had leaked online after I saw someone on Twitter discussing its design. (And if you&#x27;re still reading and want to go into the new games blind, this is your cue to head elsewhere now.)

As well as streaming games to consoles, Sony&#x27;s subscription service allows players to stream games on PC.


However, as a PlayStation Blog from the release in May states, PC streaming is not available in the following countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The news comes courtesy of artist Thomas Feichtmeir who released a screenshot of artwork used in the pitch to the publisher six years ago - now, the NDA is finally up.


Feichtmeir also worked on Blasphemous, itself a Metroidvania inspired by the Dark Souls series.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever played Destiny, you&#x27;ll know of Telesto. This exotic weapon is a fan-favourite for its exploding purple projectiles - and also notorious for often being bugged. 


It&#x27;s broken nature is so notorious, in fact, that Destiny developer Bungie has now added an Easter egg to the game where Telesto fails to properly fire - and instead sends its projectiles floating lazily into the sky while the weapon itself fizzes and sparks. (A simple reload clears the Easter egg, and the gun can then be used as normal.)


But while this appeared at first to be just a fun nod to Telesto&#x27;s oft-bugged state, fans are now suggesting the Easter egg may hint at a further secret, as Destiny 2 heads towards the end of its current season.

The move will see Meta&#x27;s overall workforce shrink by 13 percent, with some areas of the business impacted more than others. 


Specifically how this will impact the company&#x27;s development of Meta Quest remains unclear, though Zuckerburg stated today that the company&#x27;s &quot;long-term vision for the metaverse&quot; remained one of a small number of &quot;high priority growth areas&quot;.

                              <span>Almost ten months after it acquired Josh Wardle&#x27;s free browser-based puzzler and cultural phenomenon Wordle for an undisclosed seven-figure sum, the New York Times has announced the game is finally getting a dedicated editor.


Since launch, Wordle&#x27;s puzzles have drawn from the same list of five-letter words - originally totalling 2,315, but now down by six - with a new word solution being presented each day. Starting today, though, that word list will be fully curated by Wordle&#x27;s new dedicated editor, Tracy Bennett.


&quot;Wordle&#x27;s gameplay will stay the same,&quot; the publication explains in its announcement, &quot;and answers will be drawn from the same basic dictionary of answer words&quot;. However, Bennett will be responsible for making &quot;some editorial adjustments to ensure that the game stays focused on vocabulary that’s fun, accessible, lively and varied.&quot;

343 has provided extended release notes on its website, but the key additions start with the aforementioned campaign network co-op, making it possible for up to four players to experience Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign together. Crossplay between PC and Xbox devices is supported, and progress and unlocks are shared across all players, not just the host.


To accompanying the arrival of campaign co-op, the developer has added 24 new achievements, many of which will require collaboration to complete.

                              <span>The European Commission has announced that, following its initial investigation into Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it will now be opening a more &quot;in-depth&quot; Phase 2 probe to determine the deal&#x27;s likely impact on competition.


In a statement on its website, the European Commission said it had made the decision after its preliminary investigation showed Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition may &quot;significantly reduce competition on the markets for the distribution of console and PC video games, including multi-game subscription services and/or cloud game streaming services, and for PC operating systems&quot;.


It drew particular attention to its concerns Microsoft has a &quot;potential economic incentive&quot; to prevent competitors from accessing Activision Blizzard&#x27;s &quot;high-profile and highly successful games&quot; upon closure of the deal, specifically highlighting the Call of Duty series - something Microsoft has repeatedly insisted it will not do.

                              <span>With Awesome Games Done Quick&#x27;s next charity speedrun event rapidly gaining on us, organisers have revealed timings for all 140+ speedruns scheduled for the January 2023 show.


Next year&#x27;s Awesome Games Done Quick runs from 8th-15th January, and will once again be an online-only event as organisers look to move its in-person component away from its usual haunt of Florida. Earlier this year, organisers said the state&#x27;s &quot;continued disregard for COVID-19&#x27;s dangers... and an increased aggression towards LGBTQ+ individuals&quot; made it impossible to provide a &quot;safe and welcoming&quot; event for all.


While the lack of an in-person event might be a disappointment for some, Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 will still feature an extensive speedrunning schedule, running 24 hours everyday across the week with an occasional pauses for breaks. As ever, it&#x27;s an eclectic line-up - covering triple-A titles, smaller-scale indie offerings, retro classics, and other assorted oddities (I can&#x27;t pretend I&#x27;m not immediately intrigued by a game called Salamander County Public Television) - and you can have a leisurely peruse on the Games Done Quick website.

This project is reported to be in development with Korean Studio NCsoft, which is most famous for publishing the MMORPG Guild Wars and its subsequent sequel.


A source familiar with both Sony and NCsoft reportedly told Korean news site MTN the two companies have &quot;tentatively agreed to pursue a business partnership in which NC will create new games using Sony&#x27;s promising game IP&quot;.

The tour begins next Tuesday, 15th November, with five bits of DLC - two Content Creator Packs (each costing £4.79/$5.99 USD/€5.99), two radio stations (priced at £2.89/$3.99 USD/€3.99 each), and a free update. The first of these, the Heart of Korea Content Creator Pack, adds 60 assets - including service buildings and unique structures - inspired by South Korean cities. It arrives alongside the K-Pop Radio Station DLC.


Cities: Skylines players can also pick up the Skyscrapers Content Creator Pack on the same day, featuring 15 skyscrapers inspired by iconic buildings around the world. This one&#x27;s twinned with the separate 80&#x27;s Downtown Beat Radio Station DLC.

                              <span>On Death Stranding&#x27;s third anniversary, Kojima Productions is celebrating its latest milestone.


Since its launch, over 10 million players (or Porters) have set foot in Hideo Kojima&#x27;s apocalyptic version of the United States and taken on the role of courier Sam Bridges. 


These latest figures take into account all platforms the game is available on, as well as those users that played through subscription services.

                              <span>Today brings our final big information dollop for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet ahead of their release next week - and our first look at a feature in the game which has remained under wraps until now. 


Each game will feature a separate book of expedition records with rare Pokémon to track down, letting you retrace their steps to encounter them yourselves. However, it sounds like the Scarlet Book and the Violet Book will feature alternate versions of these Pokémon, depending on which version of the upcoming games you have.


Put more simply: today&#x27;s trailer appears to show a pair of new evolutions for Donphan. One is primal looking with huge tusks, which you&#x27;ll meet in Scarlet. One is futuristic-looking with dot-matrix eyes, which you&#x27;ll meet in Violet.

                              <span>Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus VR and creator of the Oculus Rift, has designed a new VR headset to celebrate the popular light novel and anime series Sword Art Online which can also kill you.

The plot of Sword Art Online revolves around a massive multiplayer online role-playing game in VR, which is played using a headset called the NerveGear. A number of players get locked into the game and the NerveGear can&#x27;t be removed whilst a player is still online. And (spoiler alert) it&#x27;ll kill a player in real-life if they die in the game. 

Luckey revealed his own version of this headset, named the OQPNVG, in a blog post on 6th November, to coincide with the day the events of Sword Art Online begin. (@SAO_IRL on Twitter is dedicated to broadcasting the events of the series as if it was actually happening, if a murder headset isn&#x27;t enough realism for you.)

                              <span>Ahead of its release tomorrow, Sony Santa Monica has shared the first set of patch notes for God of War Ragnarök.


There are a myriad of fixes addressed in this day one patch, ranging from the UI to the combat. 


Some of the fixes detailed within this update from the developer include a variety of quest, creature, and ability names. Therefore, if you are keen to avoid as many potential spoilers as possible, I would advise not reading the full notes. However, Sony Santa Monica &quot;strongly&quot; encourages everyone to download this patch before playing the game.

The change is one of dozens detailed in Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s patch notes for Update 1.61, which is now rolling out to PC, consoles and even Stadia.


This update is mostly centred around fixing bugs in the game - such as issues with Xbox saves not transferring properly to PC and PlayStation, plus an issue on PC where the game&#x27;s frame rate would drop after exiting a menu.

More specifically, the project is a collaboration between Capcom and Timi Studio Group - the Tencent-owned developer behind the likes of Call of Duty mobile, Pokemon Unite, and Arena of Valor - and promises to &quot;reproduce the hunting actions that define the Monster Hunter series&quot; for mobile devices and phones.


&quot;This first-time partnership between TiMi and Capcom will combine the experience and strengths of both sides,&quot; reads the press release announcing the news, &quot;allowing Monster Hunter to scale to more platforms with an aim to give global hunters - experienced or new - the freedom to hunt as they desire, anytime and anywhere.&quot;

The news was revealed by our partner site GamesIndustry.biz, and it sees an end to a series that debuted in 2015 - though one whose roots go back much further as a crowdfunded project brought to life by its community. 


Bandai Namco went on to publish the first three games in the series, with Project Cars 3 releasing in 2020 - several months after EA had acquired Slightly Mad Studios as part of its takeover of Codemasters.

The past two months have seen both Project Cars and Project Cars 2 disappear forever. The first game lasted longer - slightly - until 3rd October. Project Cars 2 was removed from sale on 21st September.


In a statement posted to Twitter, developer Slightly Mad Studios blamed &quot;expiring car and track licenses&quot;, but said existing owners would still be able to play both games, and multiplayer servers would remain available.

                              <span>Take-Two has delivered its latest financial report, and revealed that Grand Theft Auto 5 only shipped around 1m units this quarter. 


While this may still seem an impressive figure, it is a marked decrease from previous quarters and the lowest quarter in shipments that Grand Theft Auto 5 has had since its release in 2013. For comparison, in February of this year, the publisher shared it had sold 5m copies between then and the previous November. 


Even with this slow down in sales, the publisher stated the game has now sold more than 170m units worldwide.

                              <span>Even more evidence of a PC release of PS5 exclusive Returnal has emerged, further cementing its long-rumoured existence.

In May, the first signs of a PC release popped up on SteamDB, under the name Oregon. In September, what appeared to be footage of Returnal running on a PC dev kit was spotted by Digital Foundry&#x27;s Alex Battaglia during a GDC talk.

The most recent evidence of a PC port comes from the Oregon listing on SteamDB.

                              <span>Where on earth is that delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake? It&#x27;s a question Ubisoft seemingly gets quite a bit, as it has now published an official FAQ page to explain what exactly is going on. 


For those closely following news around the announcement of the remake and its subsequent delays, there&#x27;s not a lot new here. The game is still very much alive, Ubisoft promises, albeit no longer at its original development studio.


Still, the page is a handy place for fans to go for a bit of reassurance. Ubisoft has a habit of delaying games for years - looking at you Skull and Bones, and you Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, and you Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - without providing much proof they still exist.

Sega posted the announcement yesterday, ahead of Sonic Frontiers&#x27; release today, to inform players how to access the DLC.

&quot;DLC content will not be valid if installed after the tutorial area,&quot; Sega tweeted.

                              <span>Nintendo has reported a slowdown in Nintendo Switch console sales, and a slight reduction in its annual sales forecast.


Overall, Nintendo Switch has now sold 114.3m consoles worldwide, with another 6.68m sold over the last two quarters. 2.23m of these were of the original 2017 Switch, while Switch OLED sold 3.53m and Switch Lite sold 920k.


However, Nintendo admitted it had sold 19.2 percent fewer consoles year-on-year over the financial year so far - in part, it said, due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. In response, Nintendo has cut its Switch sales forecast for the year from 21m to 19m consoles.

The scientists tested the exploit by modifying an off-the-shelf drone to create a flying scanning device, the Wi-Peep. The robotic aircraft sends several messages to each device as it flies around, establishing the positions of devices in each room. A thief using the drone could find vulnerable areas in a home or office by checking for the absence of security cameras and other signs that a room is monitored or occupied. It could also be used to follow a security guard, or even to help rival hotels spy on each other by gauging the number of rooms in use...</span>

                              <span>Activision has detailed more of its plans for Call of Duty in 2023, saying next year will bring the series&#x27; &quot;next full premium release&quot; - a statement initially appearing to contradict previous reports there&#x27;d be no brand-new Call of Duty title in 2023.


According to Activision&#x27;s newly revealed third quarter financial results, 2023 will bring &quot;the most robust Call of Duty live operations to date, the next full premium release in the blockbuster annual series, and even more engaging free-to-play experiences across platforms&quot;.


It&#x27;s the talk of the &quot;next full premium release&quot; that&#x27;s caught people&#x27;s attention, particularly in light of claims made by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier in February that Call of Duty wouldn&#x27;t be getting a new mainline series entry in 2023 - marking the first time in just under two decades it had skipped an annual release. Schreier then expanded on those assertions last month, saying Activision would instead be &quot;selling new stuff&quot; for Modern Warfare 2 - &quot;an expansion or something like that&quot; including &quot;campaign stuff&quot;.

                              <span>Over a decade and a half after a live-action Gears of War movie was first touted, Netflix has announced it&#x27;s adapting The Coalition&#x27;s cover shooter series for the small screen.


A Gear of War movie was first trumpeted back in 2007, when New Line Cinema purchased the rights for a live-action adaptation. However, its originally planned 2009 release date came and went, and the project has bounced around in development hell ever since - last resurfacing in 2019 when it was reported it would no longer even be set in the same universe as the games.


Whatever happened to that version of the adaptation, we may never know, as Netflix - on this, the 16th anniversary of the original Gears of War&#x27;s release - has now announced a new partnership with current franchise stewards The Coalition.

                              <span>Dead Cells, the acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire, has thrown open its doors to welcome another batch of familiar gaming faces - from indie favourites including Hotline Miami, Shovel Knight, Terraria, and Slay the Spire - in its new Everyone is Here Vol. 2 update on PC.


A follow-up to last year&#x27;s first Everyone is Here update - which featured crossovers with Hollow Knight, Hyper Light Drifter, Blasphemous, Guacamelee, Curse of the Dead Gods, and Skul: The Hero Slayer - Vol. 2 features guest appearances from another six titles.


Up first is Yacht Club Games&#x27; beloved retro platformer Shovel Knight - no stranger to crossovers and cameos - whose Dead Cells appearance takes the form of a new outfit and an accompanying Brutality weapon known as the King Scepter. THis lets players mimic King Knight, dashing around and bouncing on enemies&#x27; heads.

                              <span>Indie hit Stray has been given a Game Boy-inspired makeover by some retro-loving animators. 


Youtube channel 64 Bits has released a demake video showing what Stray would look like if it had been released on a Game Boy. This includes textures and sounds, and to be honest, it looks great! 


The video itself offers a &#x27;highlight reel&#x27; of Stray&#x27;s opening chapters. It shows the titular stray cat&#x27;s sudden separation from their clowder, and their descent into the chasm leading to an unpopulated underground city.

                              <span>BioWare has issued a small teaser and brief update on the status of its next Mass Effect game, in celebration of the franchise&#x27;s annual N7 Day today,  7th November. 


A blog update from BioWare states that &quot;pre-production development has been proceeding very well&quot; as Mass Effect franchise veterans and newcomers work together to craft &quot;characters and locations that you&#x27;ll love, as well as revisiting many that you&#x27;ll remember&quot;. 


That last line stuck out to me, as fan speculation continues on what to expect from this new entry into the franchise. From the off, in BioWare&#x27;s 2020 reveal trailer for the project, fans were greeted by an older version of Liara - apparently centuries older than she appeared in the series&#x27; original trilogy. But that teaser also included hints we&#x27;d hear more about what&#x27;s been going on in Andromeda - the setting for the series&#x27; most recent entry - as well.

A questionnaire on the Xbox Insider app, spotted by Windows Central, is gauging the potential popularity of new energy efficiency features on PC and console.



That includes the possibility of in-game features that can optimise settings (resolution, frame rate, etc) to save energy, and games automatically lowering frame rate or resolution when left idle or inactive.

                              <span>A Modern Warfare 2 developer left an amusing and easily missed Easter egg tucked away in the game&#x27;s Al Bagra Fortress map.


The Easter egg in question is written in very, very, small text, and can be found on the side of one of the map&#x27;s exhibits. 


While at first glance it may simply look like standard and somewhat generic writing informing in-game tourists about this and that, it is actually a note from one of the game&#x27;s texture artists masquerading as part of the exhibition.

                              <span>The next Nintendo Indie World presentation will be broadcast this week, on Wednesday 9th November at 5pm UK time. You should expect around 25 minutes of trailers and updates on Switch indie games, Nintendo has said.


These official Nintendo shows typically feature a range of smaller Nintendo Switch games - so don&#x27;t go in expecting to see Zelda or F-Zero.


High up on many fans&#x27; wishlists will likely be Hollow Knight: Silksong, which currently sits with a vague release window of... sometime in the next eight months. Will we see it this week? There&#x27;s only one way to find out.

The content will focus on the characters Sir Edmund Rockwell and Helena Walker.

In part two of the game&#x27;s Genesis expansion, Rockwell is voiced by David Tennant (everyone&#x27;s favourite Doctor in Doctor Who) and Walker is voiced by Madeleine Madden (known for playing Egwene al&#x27;Vere in The Wheel of Time). Both actors will reprise their roles for the new content.

                              <span>There&#x27;s an official Stranger Things VR game on the way from developer Tender Claws.


Made in collaboration with Netlflix and the series&#x27; writers, this upcoming release will put players into the shoes of season four&#x27;s main antagonist Vecna as he &quot;explores unknown realities, forms the hive mind, and enacts his plan for revenge against Eleven and Hawkins&quot;. 


All of this revenge planning and hive mind forming will see Vecna invading the memories and dreams of other characters from the show. This in turn will provide the ability for players to &quot;harness telekinetic powers to battle humans and creatures alike&quot;. You can see a teaser for this upcoming release below.

But it turns out he was almost cast as Geralt of Rivia in 2018 when the role was first being cast. 


According to a report by redanianintelligence, Hemsworth was actually a frontrunner for the part before the role ultimately went to Cavill.

                              <span>Microsoft has commented on the ongoing issues affecting Halo Infinite after its arrival late last year - after which, it says, the game &quot;fell short&quot; by not being able to satisfy players. 


Speaking to the Friends Per Second Podcast, Microsoft&#x27;s Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty praised the team which launched Halo Infinite after working through the pandemic to get the game done - but also admitted Microsoft had fallen short with its support for the game after its arrival.


&quot;In December I think we had a peak of around 20 million players playing the game, and just kudos to the team for building and shipping a game during some pretty challenging times, right?&quot; Booty said. &quot;Last year - still in the midst of the pandemic, still everybody trying to figure out how to adapt to remote work and hybird work. I think if there&#x27;s a worse-case condition for trying to get games done, it is the big multi-hundred person team trying to final a game. It went smack into that. So, kudos to shipping it.

K&#x27;Sante is the latest champion to be added to the game, which had its Worlds 2022 tournament this weekend featuring a performance from rapper Lil Nas X.


Yet the game&#x27;s executive producer has admitted the developer would replace certain words such as &quot;lover&quot; and &quot;partner&quot; in countries with poor LGBT+ rights.

                              <span>Battlefield 1 became the most popular Battlefield game on Steam over the past week, thanks to a hefty discount.

                              <span>I have been meaning to write about Joe Sullivan, Uber’s former Chief Security Officer. He was convicted of crimes related to covering up a cyberattack against Uber. It’s a complicated case, and I’m not convinced that he deserved a guilty ruling or that it’s a good thing for the industry.
I may still write something, but until then, this essay on the topic is worth reading.</span>

The new Ghost type Pokémon - which recently popped up, albeit in an uncatchable form, in Pokémon Go earlier this week - is now making its debut in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. You&#x27;ll be able to find them in the Paldea region. 

Here&#x27;s a brief video showing them in action (click to watch on YouTube if the embed isn&#x27;t working!):

                              <span>It looks like a big budget game adaptation of the John Wick movie franchise is on the way.

As spotted by Indiewire, Lionsgate&#x27;s CEO recently addressed investors and confirmed that the team was &quot;fielding proposals&quot; about a &quot;AAA&quot; John Wick game to expand the multimillion dollar series beyond Hollywood movies.

Although no concrete details were shared, Jon Feltheimer said that Lionsgate &quot;believe there is a big AAA game to be made out of John Wick&quot; but didn&#x27;t &quot;want to say anything more&quot; right now.

                              <span>Rumour has it, Blizzard may be set to release Diablo 4 in April 2023.

That&#x27;s according to the XboxEra podcast and Windows Central, both of which believe Diablo 4&#x27;s tentative &quot;2023&quot; release window can be narrowed down to April, with early access reportedly launching in February, and pre-orders going live as early as next month. 

It&#x27;s thought more news will come during December&#x27;s The Game Awards, which certainly sounds plausible enough. Thankfully, we won&#x27;t have long to wait to test if the rumours are true; the Awards are set for 8th December which is just a few short weeks away now.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer says &quot;what could happen&quot; with older Activision Blizzard franchises like StarCraft is &quot;pretty exciting&quot;.

Asked what could be on the horizon should Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition go ahead, Spencer added that he was &quot;excited about getting to sit down with the teams at Activision and Blizzard and King to talk about back catalogue and opportunities that we might have&quot;.

&quot;The first thing I would say is, I&#x27;m not allowed to make any decisions about what happens at Blizzard or Activision or King,&quot; Spencer told Wired (via NME). &quot;So this is all just kind of talking and thinking about what the opportunity is.

                              <span>Riot Games has teamed with GGTEch and NUEL to launch Rising Stars, a new women&#x27;s League of Legends standalone tournament.

In a bid to &quot;promote inclusion and opportunities in esports&quot;, Riot says each competing team is &quot;required to be entirely composed of women&quot; aged at least 16 years old. 

An online tournament for teams from across Europe - albeit one &quot;primarily geared toward participants from the UK, Ireland, and the Nordics&quot; - is scheduled to take place on 26th and 27th November, and played on the EUWest server. Participants require a League of Legends account &quot;in good standing&quot; and will battle for their share of a £3000 prize pool. Registration closes on 22nd November.

                              <span>A Modern Warfare 2 promotional campaign that gives a double XP code to US players in exchange for buying Jack Link&#x27;s Pork Strips has caused a bit of a kerfuffle after purchasers realised that many have unwittingly bought packs after the codes were stolen.

As spotted by PC Gamer, rather than hide the code inside the packaging, Jack Link&#x27;s Spicy Dill Pickle Pork Strips chose to add the code in a tiny little pamphlets glued onto the front. However, it looks like douchbags like this dude are going around and stealing them.

&quot;On the ground reporting from Walmart on the Jack Links beef jerky double XP codes for Modern Warfare 2 being stolen from every store I can find,&quot; reported COD content creator, Modern Warzone.

Launching alongside Season 2, the new hero - a tank from the same brotherhood of monks as Zenyatta - is reportedly designed to hold off other tanks in a bid to improve the free-to-play shooter&#x27;s combat balance.

Ramattra has two forms; the defensive Omnic form, and Nemesis, which is just as aggressive as it sounds.

Whilst the &quot;fresh&quot; part of the moniker suggests this is a deal that should primarily interest lapsed players, Amazon says the &quot;new servers will offer old and new players a chance to completely restart their New World experience as pre-existing high-level characters cannot be transferred in&quot;.

&quot;It’s a great opportunity for new and lapsed players to experience all that has changed over the game&#x27;s first year,&quot; the team said.

Whilst last week we got a peek at protagonist Frey&#x27;s &quot;magic-enhanced parkour&quot; and traversal skills, this week we can &quot;dive into the fundamentals of Frey&#x27;s magical combat skills&quot; and find out more about the types of magic, attacks, and upgrades we&#x27;ll be able to unlock.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3 was reportedly &quot;scoped as a semi open-world game&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to games journalist Imran Khan, who offered an insider peek at the sequel&#x27;s lengthy delay on his Patreon, reflecting on why those open world rumours seemingly didn&#x27;t amount to anything in the end. 

&quot;At one point in development, Bayonetta 3 was scoped as a semi-open world game,&quot; Khan wrote on a public Patreon post. &quot;The design was going to draw more off Astral Chain than Nier Automata, but the idea was that a large hub world would send Bayonetta (or whoever else) to different worlds which would themselves be fairly open. Maybe Super Mario 64 would be a good reference point for this.

&quot;Here is our updated Roadmap for Early Access!&quot; exclaims Wales Interactive. &quot;It does not list everything we are working on (we have to keep some things a surprise!) and is only a response to the majority of features requested in the Steam Forum, Steam Reviews and on the Discord.&quot;

The studio adds that the list &quot;doesn&#x27;t include many of the on-going development such as new episodes (and the base content released for each episode), optimisation, network improvements, balancing, UI and QOL etc&quot; and confirms that the ping system, re-roll miracles, POV increase, enemy-auto-respawn times reduction and XP levels have already been addressed.

In a statement shared across its social media channels, the developer said that because of said confusion, it has &quot;decided to reward&quot; all Vault Edition owners - current and prospective - 10 hours of double XP tokens and 10 hours of double weapon XP tokens.

&quot;We understand there has been some confusion about an in-game-store exclusive award for the Vault Edition,&quot; the statement reads.

                              <span>Geri &quot;Ginger Spice&quot; Halliwell-Horner and Djimon Hounsou have been cast in Sony&#x27;s upcoming Gran Turismo movie.

The former is interesting not just because of her &quot;rare narrative screen appearance&quot;, as The Hollywood Reporter puts it, but also because the Spice girl is married to team principal of Red Bull&#x27;s Formula One team, Christian Horner.

Sony&#x27;s live-action Gran Turismo adaptation was announced earlier this year, and confirmation of an 11th August 2023 release date for the movie followed not long after. Stranger Things&#x27; David Harbour was the first member of the cast to be officially revealed with the news he&#x27;ll be working alongside District 9 and Elyisum director Neill Blomkamp, who&#x27;s helming the project.

                              <span>A brand-new Pokémon - first teased in October&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet trailer - has been datamined following the latest update to Pokémon Go.


Sharp-eyed fans first spotted the mysterious new Pokémon during a segment on Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s photo mode, its round grey head and twin antenna barely visible behind a chunk of UI.


There&#x27;ve been no further sightings following that discovery, and developer GameFreak is yet to reveal more, but a new Pokémon Go update has now, albeit inadvertently, kicked the little fella into the spotlight sooner than intended.

                              <span>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Capcom&#x27;s stupendous 2011 paranormal puzzle adventure about posessing inanimate objects, might be making a comeback, with the South Korean ratings board having now listed it for release on PC.


Ghost Trick, for those unlucky enough to have never made its aquaintance, was created by Shu Takumi, best known as the designer of Capcom&#x27;s much-loved Ace Attorney series. It follows the adventures of Sissel, who wakes at the beginning of the game in spirit form, inches from his corpse, with little recollection of his past. It soon transpires, though, that while Sissel has lost his memories, he&#x27;s gained some new abilities - ghost tricks, you might say! - in their place. 


From that point on, progress is generally made by watching scenes play out - Ghost Trick has a wonderfully engaging story - then rewinding back to figure out a way of influencing events to change their outcome, usually by possessing different items around the evironment and then bringing them to life at the right moment.

The Pastel Pop Kit ushers in a selection of home furnishings and decorative additions - including mirrors, shelves, and desk items - with a focus on the &quot;simple and psychedelic&quot;. That means &quot;quirky pastel prints, irregular shapes, and vintage vibes&quot; inspired by 60s and 70s design.


Next week&#x27;s second DLC, the Everyday Clutter Kit, does pretty much exactly what it says in the title, introducing items that can be used to give homes a &quot;loved and lived-in&quot; look - ranging from coffee mugs to magazine stacks.

                              <span>SNK&#x27;s second Neo Geo Pocket Color compilation for Switch and PC - which the publisher is sensibly calling Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection V2 - will be making its way to Steam and Nintendo&#x27;s eShop next Wednesday 9th November. 


As with volume 1, which released last September, this second collection bundles together 10 gaming favourites from SNK&#x27;s short-lived but much-loved Neo Geo Pocket.


Somewhat unhelpfully, SNK is yet to announce what those 10 games will be, but sharp-eyed readers with better SNK knowledge than me might find some clues in the accompanying announcement artwork below. Inevitably, there&#x27;s no pricing details yet either, but expect it to be similar to volume 1, available on Steam and eShop for £29.99/£35.99 respectively.

Celebrating the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, Insomniac Games senior community manager Aaron Jason Espinoza announced today on the PlayStation Blog that five more games will be added to the subscription service.



Sadly that doesn&#x27;t include the duo&#x27;s latest PS5 adventure, which released in June 2021 and was considered something of a showpiece for the console.

                              <span>Little Inferno is a smart indie puzzle game about putting things in a fireplace and watching them burn, with a clever story about commercialisation. 10 years later, it&#x27;s getting an expansion.


It&#x27;s been a long time coming - so long, the Ho Ho Holiday expansion (available to wishlist on Steam and Epic) will now reach us at a time we can&#x27;t afford to heat our actual homes. 


On a brighter note, Ho Ho Holiday adds a new story, 20 more toys to put in your fireplace, and 50 fresh combinations to uncover as you incinerate certain objects at the same time.

Speaking to IGN, Yoshida was asked to comment on responses to the latest trailer that features mostly white characters.


Yoshida admitted it was a difficult question to answer, but that the lack of diversity fits the &quot;isolated nature of this realm&quot; - Valisthea, where the game takes place.

This current deal won&#x27;t net you quite as much content, but it&#x27;s definitely a lot cheaper.
Developer Fatshark is giving away Warhammer: Vermintide 2 on Steam. This isn&#x27;t just a free-to-play weekend, it&#x27;s free to keep!

                              <span>A leaked video reportedly showing footage from Hideo Kojima&#x27;s next project is currently circulating on social media. A title card shown at the end of the video labels it as &quot;A Hideo Kojima Game&quot; with the apparent title of &quot;Overdose&quot;.


The two-and-a-half-minute footage shows an in-game scene with a character who looks a lot like Margaret Qualley - someone fans will recognise from her role as Mama in Kojima&#x27;s previous game Death Stranding. 


The video looks as if it was originally designed for internal use, as it also features a feed of someone apparently playing the scene. All of this has then been videoed by someone else, off of a very reflective screen which shows the man taping the footage to be lying in bed half-naked. Lovely.

In its latest blog post, developer Bungie states that a &quot;notable&quot; number of PlayStation 5 players are actually still playing the PS4 version.



A PS5 and Xbox Series X/S upgrade was released for the game back in 2020, offering improved visuals and framerates.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid maker Hideo Kojima has said his development studio will remain independent - despite numerous offers from interested parties. 


The past year has seen a flurry of mergers and acquisitions within the video game industry, with Microsoft following up its Bethesda purchase by launching its attempt to buy Activision Blizzard, while Sony has gobbled up Bungie and Take-Two has taken on Zynga.


Don&#x27;t expect the Death Stranding developer to follow suit, however - even as Kojima looks to be building new games for both Microsoft and Sony.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima has addressed the persistant internet rumours that he has something to do with PlayStation 5 vapourware project Abandoned. 


Blue Box, the developer of Abandoned, gained internet fame for continually teasing that there was more to its survival horror game than met the eye. Fans pounced on the suggestion it was linked to Kojima, or was one of the many Silent Hill projects in production. Neither is the case.


&quot;Users just kept sending me pictures of this Hasan [Kahraman, Abandoned&#x27;s creator]. They still send me collages and deepfake images - like 20 a day. It&#x27;s really quite a nuisance! [laughs] This has been going on for almost two years now,&quot; Kojima said, speaking in the latest episode of his Spotify podcast.

As the prologue comic and animation suggest, Sonic Frontiers is a more story-driven adventure than you might expect, so this is your notice to watch out for spoilers online.



And don&#x27;t worry - we won&#x27;t share any here. Instead, here&#x27;s the latest trailer.

                              <span>In 1878, a 55-foot-long giant squid washed up on the shores of Glover’s Harbour, Newfoundland. It’s the largest giant squid ever recorded—although scientists now think that the size was an exaggeration or the result of postmortem stretching—and there’s a full-sized statue of it near the beach where it was found.
As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Prevention is often seen as the responsibility of the software developer, as they are required to securely develop and deliver code, verify third party components, and harden the build environment. But the supplier also holds a critical responsibility in ensuring the security and integrity of our software. After all, the software vendor is responsible for liaising between the customer and software developer. It is through this relationship that additional security features can be applied via contractual agreements, software releases and updates, notifications and mitigations of vulnerabilities...</span>

This blog post was inspired by a previous Kubernetes blog post about
Advanced Server Side Apply.
The author of said blog post listed multiple benefits for applications and
controllers when switching to server-side apply (from now on abbreviated with
SSA). Especially the chapter about
CI/CD systems
motivated me to respond and write down my thoughts and experiences.
These thoughts and experiences are the results of me working on Kluctl
for the past 2 years. I describe Kluctl as &quot;The missing glue to put together
large Kubernetes deployments, composed of multiple smaller parts
(Helm/Kustomize/...) in a manageable and unified way.&quot;
To get a basic understanding of Kluctl, I suggest to visit the kluctl.io
website and read through the documentation and tutorials, for exampl…</span>

                              <span>Frogwares has shared a first gameplay trailer for its upcoming remake of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened - the studio&#x27;s Lovecraft-themed crossover from 2007 - alongside news that the project will be launching early next year.


Frogwares revealed its plans for a &quot;full remake and substantial rewrite&quot; of The Awakened back in July, launching a Kickstarter campaign shortly after to secure additional funding to complete the game - a step the Ukranian studio said was necessary due to complications arising from Russia&#x27;s ongoing invasion. 


Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, in its new guise, will rework the events of the original to serve as a continuation of the studio&#x27;s young Sherlock arc, which began in last year&#x27;s enjoyable Chapter One. As such, it&#x27;ll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an investigation soon leading to a Cthulhu-worshipping cult and other Lovecraft-inspired horrors.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 composer Sarah Schachner has revealed she&#x27;ll no longer be writing music for the game or have any involvement in its soundtrack release, blaming an &quot;increasingly challenging&quot; working dynamic with the project&#x27;s audio director.


Schachner - whose extensive CV includes composing credits on the likes of Anthem, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare - was widely praised for her work on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare&#x27;s soundtrack in 2019.


Schachner returned for this year&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2, but has now confirmed she won&#x27;t be providing any further music for the title - or indeed Call of Duty: Warzone - as a result of seemingly insurmountable work concerns.

                              <span>This year marks the tenth anniversary of Double Fine and iam8bit&#x27;s Day of the Devs indie showcase, and organisers are celebrating that milestone this Saturday, 5th November, with a big in-person event. Ahead of that, though, we got a taste of some of the titles that&#x27;ll be in attendance courtesy of a brand-new Day of the Devs livestream. You&#x27;ll find everything that got an airing - some of it new, some of it not - detailed below, but if anything takes your fancy, it&#x27;s worth checking out the livestream, which contains plenty of new footage from each game.

Mina the Hollower


Mina the Hollower is Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games&#x27; latest retro-inspired project, a challenging action-adventure RPG inspired by the Game Boy Colour. Landing somewhere between Link&#x27;s Awakening and Bloodborne, it&#x27;s &quot;a bone chilling new adventure&quot; starring a whip-wielding inventor mouse whose attacks are intentionally slow - meaning spacing and timing is crucial during combat. Mina also has a signature burrowing technique preventing her from being damaged when underground, and an upgrade system that requires collecting bones from defeated enemies to level up different skills. There&#x27;s no release date for Mina the Hollower yet, but it&#x27;s currently &quot;deep in development&quot;.

                              <span>AMD has revealed its first RDNA 3 graphics cards, the $1000 Radeon RX 7900 XTX and $900 RX 7900 XT. As the numbering scheme and price points indicate, these are high-end models designed to compete with Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 4090 and 4080, but they come with more substantial changes than you might expect - including FSR 3, designed to counter Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS 3 frame generation, and a brand new chiplet-based design.


Before we get into the features though, let&#x27;s take a look at the cards themselves. The chiplet design breaks a traditional monolithic GPU into several interconnected sections. For RDNA 3, that&#x27;s a single 5nm graphics compute die (GCD) that&#x27;s 300mm² and six 6nm memory cache dies (MCDs) that are each 37mm². This design means that only the most critical areas need to be made with a cutting-edge 5nm process, helping to improve CPU yields, reducing costs and ultimately consumer prices. However, it also requires a fast interconnect between the different chips - which runs at 5.3TB/s here. This same chiplet approach worked brilliantly with Ryzen, transforming AMD from an also-run to a growing giant, so it&#x27;ll be fascinating to see how it if works miracles in the GPU space too.


Each of the dies are impressive in their own right. The memory cache die uses a 64-bit memory controller and a second-gen Infinity Cache, which combine to provide 2.7 times the peak bandwidth of RDNA2 designs. Meanwhile, the graphics compute die offers unified RDNA 3 compute units with hardware for stream processing, AI acceleration and RT. The design also decouples shader and front end clocks speed, with 2.3GHz for the former and 2.5GHz for the latter, which AMD says will result in a more efficient design - with up to 25 percent power savings in terms of shaders and 15 percent higher front-end clock frequency.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we react to Sony&#x27;s eye-opening announcement of its PlayStation VR2 pricing, alongside Eurogamer&#x27;s resident VR superfan and advocate Ian Higton as a special guest.

The PSVR2 is a high-end device and it was never going to be cheap, but its £530 cost (£570 if you actually also want something to play) has placed it out of reach for many console players  - let alone those without a PS5 already. Of the many headset options available, Sony&#x27;s was expected to be the most likely to attract a wider audience and grow the budding VR scene. But with that price, and a line-up of games you can mostly play elsewhere, why not choose another option - if you are interested in VR at all? 
Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan join Ian and me as we discuss why the headset costs so much, what Sony could do to sweeten the deal, and what future we think PSVR2 now has at that price point.

                              <span>Using attachments in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 might actually be making weapons worse, players believe. 


Filling up attachment slots was common advice for previous Call of Duty games, since the drawbacks were negligible compared to the benefits. 


But the community now thinks filling up all five attachment slots in MW2 may not be optimal, with drawbacks for many attachments not outweighing the benefits.

We were originally expecting Blood Bowl 3 back in August 2021, though its claret-filled casualties failed to turn up on time. Nacon belatedly confirmed it had delayed the project, blaming production delays due to the pandemic.


A further delay last year saw Blood Bowl 3 pushed to a late 2022 launch. Here&#x27;s hoping today&#x27;s final revision to February 2023 is the one that now sticks.

                              <span>This is just a quick little public service announcement, as it looks like Subnautica will leave Xbox Game Pass this month. 
Its removal has not been previously announced by Xbox, as the departures of other games leaving its subscription service in October have. Still, the game now features on the &#x27;Leaving Soon&#x27; section for the service.
Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for clarification.

                              <span>A million players have already flocked to Asobo Studio&#x27;s rat-riddled A Plague Tale: Requiem.
Sharing the milestone on Twitter, publisher Focus Entertainment thanked all those who had embarked on this &quot;incredible journey with Amicia and Hugo&quot; so far.
A Plague Tale: Requiem released on 18th October for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X (as well as on Xbox Game Pass), and Nintendo Switch via cloud play. Today&#x27;s figure includes players from all of these platforms, and doesn&#x27;t break anything out in terms of full sales.

                              <span>Modders have been adding weapons from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 into Fallout 4, ensuring the guns feel the same down to every detail. 


As well as the weapon model itself, sounds, animations, and customisability have all been ported over from MW2. The end result is a group of weapons that feel incredibly realistic in a game where weapon feel isn&#x27;t a strong point. 


Current weapons available to download are the M4 assault rifle and Signal 50 sniper rifle, with plans to add more down the line.

                              <span>PlayStation fans are now manually listing the games leaving PlayStation Plus, as Sony removes its Last Chance to Play tab.


Last week we reported that Sony had seemingly removed expiry dates from PS Plus, with only one game listed in the Last Chance to Play tab.


Now that tab has disappeared. Rez, the only game in the tab at the time of writing, is still currently listed as a PS Plus game, but without an expiry date.

It was previously revealed that players will soon be able to earn XP just through playing, but now we have more detail.


When this update goes live on 8th November, Halo Infinite&#x27;s &quot;Match XP Beta&quot; will see players rewarded for playing &quot;whatever mode they want&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard has filed a last-minute attempt to delay the counting of votes from some of its workers seeking to form a union.


Last month, Blizzard&#x27;s Albany-based band of Diablo testers formally  won the right to form a union following a months-long process. Ballots were subsequently sent out, with the result due to be announced on 18th November. 


Now, Activision Blizzard has entered a motion to impound those ballots, GamesIndustry.biz reports. The company&#x27;s top brass is currently appealing the Diablo testers&#x27; ability to unionise, and claims any announcement of the results would prejudice future results.

Reddit user InterventX shared a mockup of what a more functional user interface would look like, which as it turns out just looks like the interface from Modern Warfare (2019). 


Eagle-eyed fans have pointed out Infinity Ward got a new UX/UI Director following Modern Warfare&#x27;s launch in 2019. William Faler joined the studio in October 2020, having previously been the head of UX at the American streaming platform Hulu.

                              <span>New evidence has been discovered that points towards PVP  DLC coming to Elden Ring.


As found by dataminer Sekiro Dubi, the latest update to the game includes data for text banners that read &quot;You Win&quot;, &quot;You Lose&quot;, &quot;Draw&quot;, and &quot;Begin Match&quot;.


Elden Ring players have long speculated on the empty colosseums in the game and the potential for a future PvP mode - is this now on the way? Sekiro Dubi thinks so.

                              <span>Ubisoft has finally got around to sharing more concrete information on Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope&#x27;s season pass, which has been available to purchase for some time now, breaking down the three content drops owners will receive throughout 2023.


First up is The Tower of Doooom, planned for launch in &quot;early 2023&quot;. This sees Madame Bwahstrella enlisting Mario, Rabbid Peach, and pals to help save her friend Spawny - a task that&#x27;ll require players to battle their way to the top of the titular tower in what Ubisoft is calling a &quot;highly strategic&quot; new combat game mode.


The Tower of Doooom will be followed by a currently unnamed second DLC instalment in &quot;mid 2023&quot;, taking players to an &quot;enchanting&quot; new planet. Here, they&#x27;ll be able to &quot;explore new environments, meet fun characters, discover secrets, and face off against new enemies.&quot;

In a tweet announcing Modern Warfare 2 ranked play&#x27;s planned release window, the studio said it was working with partners to deliver a number of key features at launch, including competitive modes, competitive rewards, ranked skill divisions, and top 250 leaderboards - with more details to be shared at a later date.


As part of its announcement, Treyarch also confirmed Activision will be terminating league play in Call of Duty: Black Ops - Cold War and ranked play in Call of Duty: Vanguard as of 22nd November this year. It recommended players &quot;grab their rewards&quot; in both games before then.

Now, we also have a closer look at some of the games that will be heading to this new virtual reality set, including The Dark Pictures Anthology: Switchback VR, a spiritual successor to Until Dawn: Rush of Blood.


Switchback is coming from Supermassive Games, and sees players embarking on the most terrifying roller coaster ride I have ever seen. It is all set in the world of The Dark Pictures Anthology, with director Alejandro Arque Gallardo calling it &quot;your own personal nightmare&quot;. You can see the trailer for this VR blood-fest below.

                              <span>Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced a last-minute delay for the PlayStation 5 version of Football Manager 2023, citing &quot;unforeseen complications which have arisen during the submissions and approvals process.&quot;


Football Manager 2023 was to mark the series long-awaited debut on PlayStation 5, with Sport Interactive boss Miles Jacobson having previously blamed its absence on Sony&#x27;s unwillingness to send dev kits to the studio. &quot;To make games for a platform, you need a dev kit,&quot; he explained in 2020. &quot;To get a dev kit, the platform holder has to want the game on the platform. We spoke with Sony, we have no dev kits. We spoke with Microsoft, they sent them to us.&quot;


Football fans with PS5s finally got the news they&#x27;d hoping for earlier this year, when Sports Interactive revealed Football Manager 2023 would be heading to Sony&#x27;s platform on 8th November.

                              <span>An upset Call of Duty player has sparked criticism for turning up in-person at an Activision Blizzard studio to try and get their Modern Warfare 2 ban overturned.


Writing in a now-deleted post on reddit  (thanks, PC Gamer), the first-person shooter fan stated they had been stopped by a security guard after entering the car park of the company&#x27;s office in Austin, Texas on Monday, 31st October. 


The fan says they &quot;politely&quot; asked to be let into the office to complain about their &quot;wrongful&quot; Modern Warfare 2 ban, having spent $140 on a special edition version of the game. The fan was refused entry, and told to wait for customer support to resolve the issue.

In it, the company&#x27;s board of directors advises shareholders to vote against two proposals for independent reports to be conducted into Microsoft&#x27;s military contracts. 

Proposal four, submitted by Boston Common Asset Management and Impact Investors, concerns the ethics of how the US government uses Microsoft&#x27;s technology. Proposal five, submitted by Harrington Investments, cites the potential impacts of being involved with development of weapons for the US military. 
Both proposals include statements made publicly by Microsoft employees about their disagreement on involvement with military contracts.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor looks set to launch by the end of March 2023 - even though publisher EA is yet to make it official.


Speaking to investors in a financial briefing last night, EA said it had a &quot;major IP&quot; due to arrive before 31st March next year - but that it was holding off on its big reveal until nearer the time.


The sequel to 2019&#x27;s popular Jedi: Fallen Order is really the only thing on EA&#x27;s slate this &quot;major IP&quot; without a release date could be. We already know the launch dates of EA&#x27;s upcoming Need for Speed return, its Dead Space remake and its collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Wild Hearts.

                              <span>Sony is ramping up the hype for its upcoming Norse epic God of War Ragnarök with some pretty eclectic marketing. 


Yesterday, we got to see Ben Stiller leading a group therapy session with John Travolta, LeBron James and their children, and today we get to witness Japan&#x27;s newest Ragnarök trailer.


This trailer is an upbeat little number complete with its own (quite catchy) song and dance routine. The parent in me likens it to Australian children&#x27;s music group The Wiggles, but with weapons added in to give it that bit extra. It is quite something, and I sort of love it. See it for yourself below.

FIFA 23 is the final footballing game from EA to feature the famous FIFA branding. It will also benefit from modes reflecting the upcoming 2022 and 2023 World Cups in Qatar and Australia/New Zealand. The first of those arrives next week for all major platforms except Nintendo Switch.


EA previously boasted FIFA 23 had been a &quot;record-breaking&quot; release for the series, hitting 10.3 million players in its first week, making it the &quot;biggest launch period in EA Sports FIFA franchise history&quot;.

                              <span>A new Deus Ex title is reportedly in the works at Embracer Group&#x27;s recently acquired Eidos-Montréal studio, albeit one that&#x27;s still in the &quot;very very early&quot; stages of development.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who made the claim in a tweet accompanying today&#x27;s news of Square Enix Montréal&#x27;s closure.


Although no further details on the new Deus Ex project were shared, this would seemingly be the first known instance of a major Square Enix IP being revived under Embracer Group&#x27;s watch since it acquired the likes of Tomb Raider, Thief, and Deus Ex - plus Square Enix Montréal, Eidos-Montréal, and Crystal Dynamics - as part of a $300m deal in May.

                              <span>Embracer Group is closing its down Square Enix Montréal studio - which it purchased as part of a $300m USD deal with Square Enix back in May - just weeks after rebranding it Studio Onoma.


In its Square Enix Montréal guise, Onama was a predominantly mobile-focused developer, perhaps best known for its Go series of puzzles games. It was working on Tomb Raider Reloaded, Avatar Generations, and a new Space Invaders game when it was acquired by Embracer Group alongside Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal in May.


As reported by Bloomberg, however, Embracer Group today informed staff it will be closing the studio in a move the company says will affect around 200 employees. Bloomberg&#x27;s sources claim some members of the Onama team will be transferred to Eidos-Montréal, although it&#x27;s unclear how many employees will be left without jobs following today&#x27;s news.

                              <span>A little over a week after Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s Doctor Who regeneration thrust David Tennant upon us again, everybody&#x27;s favourite Time Lord (not including Missy, obviously) has materialised in Mediatonic&#x27;s knockabout battle royale game Fall Guys for a spot of cross-promotional fun.


From today, 1st November, until Sunday, 6th November, players can find four Doctor-Who-themed costume sets in Fall Guys&#x27; premium item shop, costing 800 Show-Bucks apiece.


There&#x27;s one inspired by Tom Baker&#x27;s legendary fourth Doctor, one based on Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s incarnation, and a third modelled after the latest David Tennant regeneration - which the BBC is officially referring to as the Fourteenth Doctor - as seen at the end of showrunner Chris Chibnall&#x27;s recent swansong The Power of the Doctor.

                              <span>Kojima Productions has revealed Japanese-Australian actress Shioli Kutsuna will star in its upcoming, and for now somewhat mysterious, new game.


Kutsuna  is best known for her role as Yukio in Deadpool 2, and has also had roles in Murder Mystery and The Outsider.


This news came in true Kojima style. As with the earlier reveals of Elle Fanning&#x27;s participation in this new game, Kutsuna&#x27;s role was shared on Kojima&#x27;s website.

                              <span>16-year-old PC sim Dwarf Fortress is getting a new lease of life - and a fresh lick of visual paint - via its long-awaited Steam and Itch.io versions, which we now know will launch on 6th December. 
This version of the game will be sold for $30, and include a slightly-less-old pixel art style to make the whole thing a little easier on the eye. 
There&#x27;ll also be a &quot;new helpful tutorial&quot; to assist new players into Dwarf Fortress&#x27; labyrinthine ways, as well as a fresh soundtrack and UI.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s release is just around the corner and, in anticipation of this, Sony has released a new live-action trailer for its Norse epic. 


The trailer in question sees Ben Stiller (yes, of Dodgeball fame) dressed up as Kratos, as he leads a group therapy session with John Travolta, LeBron James and their children. Apparently, the father and son relationship we see in God of War between Kratos and Atreus is key to these famous faces nurturing their own parent-child bonds.


The resulting trailer is described as &quot;a Super Bowl-level spot&quot;, which you can see below.

                              <span>Kelsey Danger, community manager for Pokémon Go, has reported receiving &quot;violent threats&quot; following discussion of a recent bug within the game. 


Fixing the bug involved Pokémon Go developer Niantic briefly disabling the game&#x27;s Bluetooth device support - used by auto-catching accessories such as the officially-licensed Go Plus device and unofficial Gotcha wristband.


Support for these gadgets was re-enabled this morning when the bug was fixed, following a weekend of fan fury directed at Danger.

The update hits FIFA 23 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One - but Nintendo Switch is not on the list.


As with recent versions of FIFA on Nintendo Switch, FIFA 23 on Nintendo Switch is a &quot;Legacy Edition&quot;, which means it includes the same gameplay features from FIFA 22 Legacy Edition without any new development or significant enhancements.

A post on Reddit detailing a message from Nacon&#x27;s customer support claims the publisher made an error advertising the upgrade.


&quot;We inform you that the developers confirm that if you bought the version of the video game for PS4 it is not possible to update the video game for the PS5 version,&quot; Nacon explained in a reply to one owner of a PS4 version of the game.

Mei, one of the game&#x27;s damage characters, has an ability called Ice Wall, which projects a huge wall of ice in front of her.

Ice Wall is a useful ability which can block the opposing team&#x27;s path and line of sight. Players found a novel way to use it, but not without some bugs.

In its first three days, the blockbuster game generated $800m worldwide. According to Activision&#x27;s numbers makes it the highest grossing piece of entertainment all year, more than 2022&#x27;s biggest films Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Top Gun: Maverick combined.


The previous opening record was held by 2011&#x27;s Modern Warfare 3, which made $775m worldwide over five days. The latest game beat this record in just three.

                              <span>I recently got word there was a Monkey Island-like game in the works. This in itself is not exactly unusual - point and click games have always been around, even if they are not as prevalent as they once were. 


But this Monkey Island-like game has something else going for it that made my ears prick up. Not only is it described as a &quot;merry and macabre point and click adventure game&quot; by its developers, but it also happens to have Jonathan Ackley (Curse of Monkey Island&#x27;s co-director) giving it his seal of approval. Colour me interested!


The game in question is Foolish Mortals, and it comes from the minds at Inklingwood Studios - you can see a teaser for it below. Heavily inspired by the Monkey Island series, this game takes place in an exotic locale and, as luck would have it, there is a demo for it available right now on Steam. So, of course, I headed on over to give this upcoming release a whirl.

                              <span>Microsoft loses up to $200 on each Xbox console it sells.


In an interview with CNBC, Xbox head Phil Spencer admitted its Xbox Series X/S consoles are sold at a loss, with the expectation that revenue will be made up elsewhere on accessories and games.



That&#x27;s $100 lost on the $499 Series X, and $200 on the smaller $299 Series S.

                              <span>Fortnite is hosting a Star Wars week, and introducing skins for Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Han Solo alongside a range of classic trilogy-themed acessories.


Each of the three skins includes multiple designs based on costumes worn throughout the original trilogy - so, Luke in his white farmhand tunic but also his darker Return of the Jedi look, while Leia rocks her bounty hunter disguise as well as her iconic ear buns.


The game&#x27;s ever-popular Lightsaber weapons are back, as is the return of Darth Vader and various Stormtroopers to defeat. In a nice touch, the Junk Rift item (which plummets an object onto a specific location, squashing anyone below it) can now drop Luke&#x27;s landspeeder.

An update last night removed this feature for the game. 


Steam&#x27;s family sharing feature offers users exactly what you would expect. It allows players to share the games in their Steam library with their nearest and dearest. They can then go on to earn their own achievements and save any progress made in a shared game on the Steam Cloud.

PlayStation Plus had  45.4 million subscribers as of 30th September this year, down more than two million from the 47.2 million signed up at the same point in 2021.


Sony relaunched its PlayStation Plus subscription in June, when it split the service into three tiers and launched a Game Pass-style catalogue of games for those paying more.

It&#x27;s still something of a rarity for major game developers to specifically include non-binary representation in addition to male and female. But for the Harvestella team, its inclusion feels &quot;completely normal&quot;, producer Daisuke Taka told Eurogamer.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s ongoing grasp for a chunk of the video game pie continues with the streaming service&#x27;s announcement it has now snapped up Spry Fox, the studio behind the likes of Triple Town, Alphabear, and last year&#x27;s Cozy Grove.


Netflix shared the news - which comes just shy of a year since the streaming service took its first tentative steps into gaming - on its website, saying Spry Fox&#x27;s focus on &quot;cosy, original&quot; games would help it &quot;accelerate our creative development in another beloved genre and add to the growing variety of Netflix&#x27;s games catalogue that will have something for everyone.&quot;


It&#x27;s unclear what today&#x27;s news means for Spry Fox&#x27;s previously announced publishing partnership with Epic Games, which was intended to result in a &quot;multiplatform nonviolent persistent&quot; MMO &quot;designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world&quot;.

                              <span>Playground Games&#x27; long-awaited Fable reboot continues to staff up with the news that Andrew Walsh, whose credits include senior writer on Horizon Forbidden West and associate narrative director on Horizon Call of the Mountain, has joined the team.


Walsh - whose writing career has spanned everything form The Division 2 and Prince of Persia to UK TV shows Emmerdale and Byker Grove - revealed his new role on Twitter, writing, &quot;So, Albion has beckoned once again. I&#x27;m delighted to announce that I&#x27;ve had the chance to join the wonderful team [at Playground] working on the new Fable!&quot;.


As his tweet implies, this won&#x27;t be Walsh&#x27;s first dalliance with the Fable series; he was also lead writer on Fable Legends, the ill-fated free-to-play multiplayer-based spin-off, which was cancelled in 2016 when Microsoft made the decision to close developer Lionhead Studios.

                              <span>In an appropriately spooky bit of news for All Hallows&#x27; Eve, Ghostbusters VR has re-emerged following its announcement tease earlier this year with a brand new subtitle - Rise of the Ghost Lord - and 2023 release date on PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 2.


Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord, a collaboration between Sony Pictures Virtual Reality and developer nDreams, promises to unleash an &quot;extensive and engrossing&quot; spirit-bothering adventure playable either solo or co-operatively with up to three friends. 


It also waves goodbye to the series&#x27; traditional home of New York City and makes the jump to San Franciso, taking players on a tour of some familiar sights - including the Golden Gate Bridge - as they attempt to thwart the titular Ghost Lord and his army of malevolent spirits.

The team that worked on Valve&#x27;s first-person puzzle adventure masterpiece have openly talked about cut content in the past. At the Games Developer Conference in 2012, writers Erik Wolpaw and Chet Faliszek talked about features that were cut such as Garfield references, multiple endings, and Wheatley&#x27;s early demise. Later that year at PAX Prime, Wolpaw also revealed Valve had planned to have protagonist Chell marry a turret during the game.

10 years on, speaking to Did You Know Gaming, Josh Weier has weighed in with his own insight on why these bits were cut and where they stemmed from during development.

                              <span>The Uncharted series made the jump to PC earlier this month with Naughty Dog&#x27;s Legacy of Thieves collection. And, where there are PC games, modders are never far behind, ready to put their skills into action.
One such modder is Raq (whose name you may recognise from our Tomb Raider Anniversary piece). They have created the Elena mod for Legacy of Thieves which, as I am sure you have guessed already, puts Elena into the spotlight by reskinning series hero Nathan Drake as his wife.
I am a big fan of the Uncharted series as a whole, and of Elena Fisher especially (you may be able to spot a poster of her on my wall during Newscasts). With this mod being a particularly notable one for me, I contacted Raq to find out more about why they siezed the chance to bring Elena to the fore.

There&#x27;s no word yet on which other Marvel faces might star in these games, which EA studio might be making them, or when they will see release.

In recent days, Nibel had begun posting on Patreon and planned to launch a Discord channel for followers to join. Both of these have also been scrapped, however.

                              <span>Today is the spookiest day of the year. Now, in honour of this occasion, Breath of the Wild modders have released a new fan-made DLC for the game known as &quot;The Halloween Hunt&quot;.

Waikuteru (whose name you may recognise from the Breath of the Wild &#x27;Second Wind&#x27; mod) worked with fellow modder Sockpoppet to create this haunting DLC. It includes new challenges, armour, weapons and NPCs. Oh, and there is also a new boss to defeat - The Phantom Rider.


&quot;The time of the year has come and so came the mysterious creature too,&quot; proclaims a bodiless voice in the DLC. This voice then bids Link to make haste to Korok Forest,  to help these spirits of Hyrule before it is &quot;too late&quot;.

Over the weekend, God of War creative director Cory Barlog said it was &quot;completely fucking stupid&quot; fans have to &quot;dodge the spoilers&quot; after retailers began selling Ragnarök  copies well ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch on Wednesday 9th November - still more than a week away. 


Now, Sony Santa Monica has offered its own less-sweary official comment, asking fans to be considerate of others, and advising those who wish to remain unspoiled to &quot;mute any keywords or hashtags associated with the game until release day&quot; when browsing social media.

Since the game&#x27;s reveal, fans have made the comparison with Nintendo&#x27;s adventure due to Sonic Frontiers&#x27; lush green open setting and that hero shot of the hedgehog looking out over a wide landscape.


But in an interview with Shacknews (spotted by TheGamer), Iizuka has clarified that Sonic Team&#x27;s game is more linear and - for the millionth time - open zone, not open world.

The inspiration for the move came from NASCAR 2005, according to driver Ross Chastain.

&quot;I played a lot of NASCAR 2005 on the GameCube which I had growing up,&quot; Chastain explained in his post-race interview. &quot;You could get away with it,&quot; he continued, referring to using the move in-game, &quot;and I never knew if it would actually work [in real life].&quot;

However, the hotel manager of Amsterdam&#x27;s Conservatorium Hotel is less happy about the establishment - known within Modern Warfare 2 as Breenbergh - showing up in a game that &quot;[encourages] the use of violence&quot;. 


The hotel is now considering its next possible steps in response to this inclusion.

Speaking to the Same Brain Youtube channel, Spencer pledged to keep releasing Call of Duty games on Sony&#x27;s consoles &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to&quot;. 


The future of Call of Duty on PlayStation has become a contentious topic for regulators such as the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is currently scrutinising Microsoft&#x27;s planned $68n takeover of COD publisher Activision Blizzard.

                              <span>People have suspected this for a while, but Apple has made it official. It only commits to fully patching the latest version of its OS, even though it claims to support older versions.
From ArsTechnica:
In other words, while Apple will provide security-related updates for older versions of its operating systems, only the most recent upgrades will receive updates for every security problem Apple knows about. Apple currently provides security updates to macOS 11 Big Sur and macOS 12 Monterey alongside the newly released macOS Ventura, and in the past, it has released security updates for older iOS versions for devices that can’t install the latest upgrades...</span>

                              <span>Ikea has issued a cease and desist demand to an indie horror developer insisting they change their unreleased horror game in a bid to stop press and players alike from comparing it to its global furniture chain.

The Store is Closed - which we told you about a couple of weeks ago - is a haunting mash-up of Endnight Games&#x27; The Forest (which incidentally saw its sequel, Sons of the Forest, recently delayed) and the humdrum of everyday life, and comes from indie developer Ziggy. 

Whilst it doesn&#x27;t use any of Ikea&#x27;s products, names, or branding, Ikea believes the developer is infringing on its copyright and has sent in New York legal firm Fross Zelnick. Consequently, Ziggy - who&#x27;s based in the UK - has ten days to make the changes or face legal action.

                              <span>It looks like the long-rumoured Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake may be announced at the upcoming The Game Awards.

The news comes via a now-deleted video that reportedly popped up on Chinese studio Virtuos&#x27; YouTube channel earlier today.

You can never delete something quicker than someone can save a copy of it, though; Virtuos&#x27; video - regardless of whether it had been published intentionally or otherwise - is now doing the rounds, and has Metal Gear fans speculating that the remake may soon be formally confirmed.

&quot;I got an email from Blizzard requesting that I fill out a survey. It heavily touched on topics regarding the Battle Pass and the Overwatch Store,&quot; they wrote. &quot;If you haven&#x27;t already, be sure to fill it out. I really hope this is a first step towards change.&quot;

&quot;We are disabling attachment tuning until further notice to investigate crashes for users with 5 attachments tuned,&quot; Infinite Ward announced on social media.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima has posted a tribute to Ryan Karazija, the lead singer and founder of Low Roar whose work many of us know from Kojima&#x27;s atmospheric Death Stranding soundtrack. 

Karazija died over the weekend at just 40 years old &quot;after a short illness&quot; due to complications from pneumonia.

&quot;I heard the news. I can&#x27;t believe it. I don&#x27;t want to believe it,&quot; Kojima tweeted.

                              <span>Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s Cory Barlog has apologised that fans have to &quot;dodge the spoilers&quot; after retailers broke the &quot;street date&quot; for its highly-anticipated sequel, God of War Ragnarök.

Sony&#x27;s exclusive is out on 9th November, but it seems players have got their hands on it early and are sharing screenshots online, as well as spoilers about the game&#x27;s key story beats.

&quot;You know, right now, I can really understand the benefit of having just an installer on the physical disc. smh&quot;, Barlog tweeted overnight.

Season 3 has yet to air on the streaming service, but already we have confirmation that for Season 4, Cavill is set to be replaced as titular monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia by Liam Hemsworth, most famous for playing Gale Hawthorne in The Hunger Games movie series.


Cavill, who recently announced his return to the role of Superman for DC, issued a statement praising his replacement:

That said, whilst that figure comes from SteamDB, Steam itself states the all-time peak is a more modest 30,044,046. In either case, though, it&#x27;s proof that PC gaming remains on the rise, even if the majority of those players were idling at the time (SteamDB estimates &quot;just&quot; 8.9 million were actively in-game at the time the record was set).

Steam numbers have been rising since the pandemic began in 2020, with a previous previous peak of just under 30 million set back in March this year.

                              <span>Luminous Productions has kicked off an all-new behind-the-scenes series for its upcoming action-PRG, Forspoken.

The first of a three-part series, &quot;Magic Parkour&quot; focuses on protagonist Frey Holland and - predictably enough - her &quot;magic-enhanced parkour&quot; and traversal skills. We also get to see &quot;the variety of spells at her disposal giving players a taste of what to expect when the game launches&quot;. You can check it out below:

The next video - slated to drop on 3rd November - will focus more on Forspoken&#x27;s combat &quot;and dive into the fundamentals of Frey&#x27;s magical combat skills&quot; by sharing more about the types of magic, attacks, and upgrades we&#x27;ll be able to unlock. The final video, out 10th November, showcases the quests, challenges and activities players will &quot;find and accomplish&quot; in the world of Athia.

                              <span>In a financial report that confirmed Square Enix has &quot;set new records for full-year net sales&quot;, the Japanese company says it wants to &quot;enhance [its] presence in the global market&quot; given the &quot;graying demographics&quot; for developing games primarily for the Japanese market.

In the statement, Square Enix said it was &quot;critical for [its] business that [it] produce hit titles that speak to the global market&quot;.

&quot;For our Group to better focus on developing titles for the global market in this changing environment, we need to concentrate our limited resources on the development of strong and robust titles,&quot; the company said.

                              <span>Uncharted and The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog is working with a number of other PlayStation Studios teams to develop a mysterious new project in a &quot;beloved franchise&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to a newly spotted Sony job listing (thanks VGC) seeking a game design intern to work at a &quot;new PlayStation studio based in San Diego... co-developing an exciting new project with Naughty Dog in a beloved franchise.&quot; There&#x27;s no additional information about the new studio, but it seems highly likely it&#x27;s the same San-Diego-based &quot;new internal game develop team&quot; Sony referenced in a different job listing earlier this week.


That earlier job advert initially revealed the new team was being built to collaborate on a new &quot;high visibility&quot; project with Naughty Dog and Visual Arts - Sony&#x27;s San-Diego-based support studio that most recently worked with Naughty Dog on its The Last of Us: Part 1 remake. However, a later edit removed the explicit reference to Visual Arts, for reasons unknown.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s ambitious The Duviri Paradox expansion has been delayed into 2023 - but there&#x27;re still a couple of treats heading to the free-to-play sci-fi shooter before the end of the year, including a mini prequel going by the name of Lua&#x27;s Prey.


The Duviri Paradox is Warframe&#x27;s latest open-world expansion - following the likes of Plains of Eidolon and Heart of Deimos - and plunges players into the extremely weird world of Duviri, a fantasy-western-themed kingdom existing inside the mind of new big bad Dominus Thrax. More striking, though - and there&#x27;s a lot of eye-catching stuff, from its stark black and white aesthetic to its skeletal horse steed - is its new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees developer Digital Extremes &quot;flirting with rogue-like elements&quot;.


It&#x27;s intriguing stuff then, but while The Duviri Paradox was initially due to launch some time in &quot;winter 2022&quot;, Digital Extremes has now confirmed it&#x27;s pushing the expansion&#x27;s release back into 2023. The studio didn&#x27;t offer much on the reason behind the delay, only saying it was &quot;to deliver the best experience possible.&quot;

                              <span>Firaxis&#x27; Marvel-themed strategy game Midnight Suns will be adding the likes of Venom, Morbius, and Storm as paid DLC starting in early 2023.


Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, draws inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s to deliver a superhero strategy game blending turn-based combat, card-battling, and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building. At launch on 2nd December, it&#x27;ll include 12 playable heroes, ranging from the immediately familiar - think the Avengers and X-Men - to perhaps lesser-known characters from the likes of the Runaways.


However, publisher 2K has now confirmed Midnight Suns&#x27; roster will begin to expand in early 2023, when Deadpool joins the line-up as premium DLC. Deadpool arrives in the first of four planned DLC packs - all included in a season pass or available to purchase individually - with each one adding a new hero (plus their respective abilities), new story missions, upgrades for the Abbey, plus new skins and outfits.

It&#x27;s not clear exactly what this &quot;Super Game&quot; could be, but Sega has high hopes for its existing and past IPs, including Sonic.

Mentions of connecting to PlayStation Network accounts were spotted in the mobile app for Discord last week, which suggested the integration would be happening soon.

However, sources speaking to Insider Gaming stated they expect the integration to be included as part of the PS5&#x27;s 7.00 system update, which is currently scheduled for 8th March.

The map, initially called Marina Bay Grand Prix, was announced back in August during the Call of Duty (eSports) League Championship Weekend and was seemingly inspired by the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore.


But in September, any mention of the map was purged from all of Call of Duty and Infinity Ward&#x27;s social media accounts, as well as any trailers on its YouTube channel. The map was also missing during the multiplayer open beta.

The game originally arrived on Switch in digital form only accompanying Bayonetta 2, but a physical edition was promised this year exclusive to the Nintendo Store.


This was then delayed from September to the &quot;first half of October&quot;, but fans criticised the inability to pre-order in advance.

In ThrillDaWill&#x27;s words: &quot;This fan-made project combines two of the best things! Stepping on legos with your bare feet, and endless bugs and glitches!!&quot;

Earlier this week, the company shared its latest financial results, including a hardware revenue growth of 13 percent and PC Game Pass subscriptions increasing by 159 percent year on year.



However, that still wasn&#x27;t enough to meet Microsoft&#x27;s targets, according to a new financial filing (reported by Axios).

However, in doing so, it reportedly also removed Denuvo - the game&#x27;s anti-piracy software - by accident. 


While the developer has allegedly now reinstated this software, this slip-up left Gotham Knights free for hackers to, well, hack for a period of time (via Reddit).

Codes for these in-game extras are now being sold on eBay, with most sold listings ranging from around £20 to £40 and (amusingly) not always including postage. Some are even higher.

The crossplay toggle allows players to choose whether they matchmake with players from other platforms. 


Console players tend to disable crossplay to avoid matching against PC players using keyboard and mouse or may be hacking. On the flip side, PC players may wish to avoid console players who have aim assist.

Chen Xinjun, dean of the College of Marine Sciences at Shanghai Ocean University, made the remarks in response to recent accusations by foreign reporters and actor Leonardo DiCaprio that China is depleting its own fish stock and that Chinese boats have sailed to other waters to continue deep-sea fishing, particularly near Ecuador, affecting local fish stocks in the South American nation.

                              <span>Frontier has announced it is ending post-launch support for its inaugural F1 Manager sim less than two months after release, saying its next patch will be the game&#x27;s last major update as it moves staff elsewhere to &quot;ensure upcoming F1 Manager projects realise their potential&quot;.


F1 Manager 2022, which launched at the end of August, is the first of four games planned for release under Frontier&#x27;s new F1 licensing deal. It put players in the role of a team principal, challenging them to lead their &quot;drivers, engineers and fans to glory in the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Drivers&#x27; World Championship and FIA Formula 1 Constructors&#x27; World Championship&quot;.


While F1 Manager 2022 received a decent critical reception at launch, it&#x27;s drawn criticism among players for shallow, undercooked features and a significant number of bugs. Many had hoped at least some of these issues would be properly addressed through robust post-launch support, but Frontier has now called time on further development.

                              <span>10 years after its introduction, Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode has received a long overdue overhaul, with Valve finally making good on last year&#x27;s promise to replace the ageing UI with its decidedly more modern Steam Deck interface - albeit initially only for testing prior to a general release.


Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode first surfaced back in 2012, introducing an optional new UI for Valve&#x27;s storefront specifically designed for use with televisions and controllers. It&#x27;s changed in barely noticeable increments since then, lagging far behind Valve&#x27;s recent major overhaul for Steam&#x27;s desktop mode, but as of today, it&#x27;s out with the old and in with the new. 


Just as it promised last July, Valve has now replaced the old Big Picture mode with the far more modern UI created for its handheld gaming PC, Steam Deck. &quot;This controller-first interface was designed for Steam Deck in handheld and docked mode,&quot; Valve explains, &quot;and is perfect for all the scenarios Big Picture mode currently handles.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s all looking a bit Sonic the Hedgehog as the year nears its end; not only does the blue streak make his video game return next month in Sonic Frontiers, Netflix has confirmed its 3D animated series Sonic Prime is hitting the streaming service on Thursday, 15th December.


Sonic Prime was announced last February, after a bit of a premature reveal toward the end of 2020, with Netflix promising a 24-episode series that would send Sonic on a &quot;journey of self-discovery and redemption&quot; in which the &quot;fate of a strange new multiverse&quot; was in his hands.


Since then, we&#x27;ve had teases, plus a slightly more revealing 40-second trailer, confirming appearance from Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Big the Cat - who appears to be having something of a renaissance this year, seeing as he&#x27;s also been sighted in Sonic Frontiers.

                              <span>Five years after developer Jumpship formally unveiled its side-scrolling sci-fi apocalypse adventure Somerville, a release is in sight, with the studio having somewhat unexpectedly announced a 15th November launch on Xbox One and PC earlier today.


Jumpship is an independent studio founded by film animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Dino Patti, co-founder and former CEO of Limbo studio Playdead. And while Somerville&#x27;s formal reveal came in 2017, Olsen - who has worked the likes of Skyfall and The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron - had already been tinkering away on the project for three years before that.


Somerville - described as a &quot;hand-crafted narrative experience set across a vivid rural landscape&quot; that sees players navigating perilous terrain &quot;to unravel the mysteries of Earth&#x27;s visitors&quot; - has continued to look wonderfully intriguing since its big reveal. However, it&#x27;s been nearly a year since its most recent public showing.

                              <span>EA has confirmed it won&#x27;t be stopping distribution of physical products across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.


Reports have emerged that EA would no longer distribute physical games in German-speaking countries, according to its latest annual report.


However, it seems this was misinterpreted as EA confirms this is incorrect.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s full release is just around the corner, and ahead of this developer Infinity Ward is keen to clear some things up - notably that, despite some similarities in missions, the game is not running a &quot;commentary&quot; on the world&#x27;s current events.


&quot;It&#x27;s an entertainment adventure,&quot; Call of Duty narrative director Brian Bloom explained recently (via PCGamesN). &quot;And as far as real people and real places doing real things, you know, these are not based on actual events.&quot;


Bloom went on to state the team is, however, inspired by real-world events. &quot;We want you to feel like when you play the game, it&#x27;s happening in the world that you live in, and our heroes are here to do things that put the world back the way it was, in the way we left it, to restore it,&quot; he continued.

In a crossover that nobody asked for, the screenshots (spotted on Resetera) show Brazilian forward Neymar and French midfielder Pogba wearing military attire and posing like they&#x27;ve just hit a 24 killstreak. 


Rumours of footballers featuring in Modern Warfare 2 first emerged earlier this month when dataminer The Ghost Of Hope released a list of unreleased Operators that will make their way to the game.

                              <span>With Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season, Eclipse, mere days away now, developer Respawn is finally ready to discuss Catalyst, the free-to-play battle royale game&#x27;s newest hero, in more detail, breaking down the abilities she&#x27;ll bring to the latest round of the Apex Games.


Speaking at a recent press briefing, Respawn explained the starting point for Catalyst&#x27;s aesthetic was &quot;techno witch&quot;, with her final design aiming to represent both stylishness - in her emo goth vibes - and technological practicality. She is, after all, a member of a terraforming crew hired to help restore the moon of Cleo - which, as Season 15 begins, has been turned in an Apex Games arena, something Catalyst won&#x27;t stand for.


Described as an &quot;elegant and standoffish woman who likes crystals more than she likes people&quot;, Catalyst is Apex Legends&#x27; first trans character - voiced by trans actor Meli Grant - and, as Respawn succinctly puts it, simply reflects the fact the &quot;real world is a diverse place&quot;.

                              <span>Earlier this year, it was revealed that PlayStation&#x27;s London Studio, which is best known for its work on Singstar and Blood and Truth, was working on a new online game for the PlayStation 5.


Now, we have more details on what this elusive game actually is - and what it is, is an online co-op combat game that is set in a fantasy version of London.


Speaking via the SIE Blog, co-studio heads Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders shared more details about this currently unnamed game, which they call the team&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious project to date&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 players have been advised against changing their console&#x27;s region in order to gain early access to the game. 


The &quot;New Zealand&quot; trick, which lets players trick their consoles into letting them access a game that doesn&#x27;t release until midnight in their own region, has been a staple of game releases for many years. 


But Infinity Ward has issued a statement warning players may experience &quot;connectivity issues&quot; and &quot;may be locked out of the game&quot; until the game is officially released in their region.

Since its launch, Gotham Knights has faced a series of issues, with frame-rate drops, stutters, and frame-rate time fluctuations being reported across the board. 


&quot;We are aware that players on both PC and console have been experiencing performance challenges,&quot; the developer admitted earlier today, with an accompanying thread offering an overview of the game&#x27;s upcoming fixes.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has shared a list of changes to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer ahead of tomorrow&#x27;s release. The changes were made in response to feedback from the beta.


The biggest change is the addition of diamond icons above enemy heads to increase visibility. 


In the beta, there was no indicator to differentiate between friendly and enemy players. This was traditionally achieved through name tags in previous games, but Infinity Ward took the design decision to remove them, seemingly to add to realism. Players didn&#x27;t take kindly to the change and called for the return of name tags. Diamond icons are therefore a compromise between good enemy visibility and realism.

&quot;I have not played it, because people seem to want this Winds of Winter book,&quot; said Martin on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (spotted by GamesRadar).

This is due to the game&#x27;s violent content, which means it was unable to secure an age rating with the CERO (Japan&#x27;s equivalent of PEGI in Europe and the ESRB in North America). 


The developer has stated those who pre-ordered this version of the game will receive a full refund for their purchase.

                              <span>BioWare has revealed Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - the latest instalment in its fantasy role-playing series - has now reached the alpha stage of development and is playable &quot;to the very end&quot;.


That news was shared in a new developer blog post celebrating the alpha milestone. &quot;Up to this point, we&#x27;ve been working hard on the various parts of the game, but it&#x27;s not until the alpha milestone that a game all comes together,&quot; the developer explained.


&quot;Now, for the first time, we can experience the entire game, from the opening scenes of the first mission to the very end,&quot; it continued. &quot;We can see, hear, feel, and play everything as a cohesive experience.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s head of gaming Phil Spencer has discussed possible price increases across the Xbox line, acknowledging that while the company has so far maintained prices for its consoles, Game Pass, and games, it will &quot;at some point...have to raise the price on certain things&quot;.


Speaking at the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s Tech Live (thanks The Verge), Spencer admitted, &quot;We&#x27;ve held price on our console, we&#x27;ve held price on games and our subscription. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be able to do that forever... I do think at some point we&#x27;ll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.&quot;


Earlier this year, of course, Sony announced it would be increasing the cost of PlayStation 5 in response to &quot;high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends&quot;. At the time, Spencer said Xbox would not be following suit, explaining, &quot;When our customers are more economically challenged and uncertain than ever, we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right move.&quot; Given Spencer&#x27;s latest comments, though, it&#x27;s unclear how long that might last.

In a statement announcing their departure on the Rocksteady website, Warner Bros. Games&#x27; David Haddad praised the duo&#x27;s work, complimenting their commitment to &quot;the highest quality and excellence across all facets of game development&quot;.


He continued: &quot;With Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League nearly finished, they have both decided to leave Rocksteady at the end of 2022 and will begin a new adventure in gaming. We have the utmost respect and gratitude for Jamie and Sefton and wish them all the best in their new endeavour, and like many fans, we look forward to what they do next.&quot;

Rather, it will be coming after the fact, much like it did with 2018&#x27;s God of War.


Sony Santa Monica confirmed this news in  a tweet, stating it will share more details on Ragnarök&#x27;s photo mode further down the line.

By autumn 2024, all portable electronic devices sold in the EU will need to use USB Type-C for charging. The aim is to reduce electronic waste and be more consumer friendly by having just one &quot;common charger&quot;.

Howard said following the success of Fallout 3, there was a &quot;push&quot; internally to ride the momentum the game had created. The decision was made to add a &quot;big&quot; expansion pack to the game.

&quot;We think it&#x27;s a helpful guide, but with purchasing power and foreign exchange rates constantly evolving, we needed to make significant changes to those conversion recommendations to stay current,&quot; said Valve in its announcement.

At the time of writing, the game&#x27;s highest concurrent player peak (via SteamDB) is 10,851.

                              <span>In a flurry of Age of Empires news announced during the series&#x27; 25th anniversary livestream today, Microsoft revealed Age of Empires 2 and 4 are heading to Xbox consoles next year, and that an Age of Mythology Definitive Edition is in the works for PC.


Whispers of an Xbox appearance for Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition first emerged earlier today, after a new console listing was spotted on the PEGI ratings database. However, it didn&#x27;t take long for Microsoft to make it official, confirming that both it and Age of Empires 4 are heading to Xbox and xCloud in 2023.


More specifically, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition comes to Xbox on 31st January, while Age of Empires 4 is expected to arrive &quot;later in the year&quot;.

                              <span>As Bethesda&#x27;s month of Fallout 25th anniversary celebrations continues, Amazon has joined in the fun by sharing the first official image from its upcoming live-action Fallout television series.


Prime Video and Kilter Films - the production company behind the TV adaptation, headed by Westworld creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - revealed the image as part of a special birthday tweet, accompanied by the message, &quot;We made something special for the occasion&quot;.


It shows a mysterious figure silhouetted in the open entrance to Vault 33, while three other figures - all wearing their regulation blue Vault-Tec jumpsuits - look on from within. Rather ominously, a pair of legs can be seen on the floor in the distance.

                              <span>Redfall, the vampire-hunting co-op shooter from Arkane Austin, is getting into the spirit of the spooky season with a new trailer showcasing the titular town&#x27;s vampiric denizens.


It&#x27;s all a lot more atmospheric than previous showings for the game - which have predominantly focused on the camaraderie and quippery of its four playable heroes - and ramps up the spookiness by highlighting the varied vampire opponents waiting to be encountered in Redfall, Massachusetts. One sequence, in which a player prowls a blood-spattered family home by torchlight, suggests Redfall may even have time for a few proper scares among its mayhem.


&quot;From the devious Angler to the ever-vigilant Watcher,&quot; teases the blurb accompanying the trailer, &quot;this is just a bite of what you and your squad will face as you fight to take back Redfall.&quot;

The new charge comes a week after employees at Blizzard Albany (formerly Vicarious Visions) won the right to form a union.

The free-to-play multiplayer game includes custom game modes that can be freely named, but some words seemingly aren&#x27;t prevented by Blizzard&#x27;s word filters.


Twitter user Lynn MBE posted a warning on Twitter when her 12-year-old son discovered a highly inappropriate custom game.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a new update for Splatoon 3 that brings communication improvements.


Since launch, players have complained of poor communication when playing online, causing inconsistent gameplay, errors, and game crashes.


Now data transfer has been improved between players so that, according to the patch notes, data will on average be transferred &quot;about .05 seconds more quickly than before&quot;.

                              <span>Sniper: Ghost Warrior publisher CI Games has announced it&#x27;s working on a &quot;premium, multiplayer PVE tactical-shooter&quot; that&#x27;s being designed as a live-service title.


As detailed in newly updated five-year release roadmap for investors, CI&#x27;s new live-service game, codenamed Project Scorpio, is being developed by its internal Underdog Studio - which makes the Sniper: Ghost Warrior games - with an anticipated launch of 2024/5. CI says the title will be supported through in-game purchase mechanics, events, and esports post-launch.


In addition to Project Scorpio, Underdog is collaborating with a currently unnamed partner studio to develop the next entry in the Sniper: Ghost Warrior series. Details on this are limited but it&#x27;s also aiming for a 2024/5 release.

                              <span>With things starting to get a little spooky as Halloween approaches, Origame Digital - the developer behind acclaimed photography adventure Umurangi Generation - has teased a brand-new horror game it&#x27;s calling FiveSeven.


FiveSeven made a sudden and unexpected appearance (as spotted in this Reddit thread) during a video on obscure horror games by Umuragi Generation composer ThorHighHeels, with the teaser dropped right into the middle of a section on Vampire Rain: Altered Species.


Beginning with a title reading The Last Train out of Narita, the 40 seconds or so of footage - which sports a similar lo-fi aesthetic to Umurangi Generation - focuses on a besuited protagonist, seemingly named Reegan. First we see them exploring a train, initially scurrying beneath its seats, before grabbing a revolver and facing off against a sinister shadow monster.

                              <span>As the march toward Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season on 1st November continues, developer Respawn Entertainment has shared a first proper look at the free-to-play battle royale game&#x27;s new semi-terraformed Broken Moon map.


Broken Moon takes players to Cleo, the fractured moon that played a major role in new hero Catalyst&#x27;s introductory Stories from the Outlands trailer. Years after a meteor impact almost destroyed it, Cleo is now partly terraformed and habitable - but to further fund its colonisation, the government has entered into a contract to hold the Apex Games there.


When players step onto the surface of Broken Moon - said to be of a similar size to Apex Legend&#x27;s World&#x27;s Edge map - they&#x27;ll discover a world of two distinct halves, one part colonised and lush with vegetation, the other still barren.

                              <span>At a launch event in the Stade de France on Thursday, Philips announced a brand new gaming brand, Evnia, with a full lineup of monitors, keyboards, mice and headsets. The name comes from the Greek Εύ and νοια and reportedly translates as &#x27;smart thinking&#x27;, and plays into an overall wholesome and inclusive vibe with a focus on &#x27;reinventing the rules&#x27; of PC peripherals. Ironically, this kind of credo is fairly endemic amongst gaming brands, but Philips has at least made some plays to differentiate themselves, designing products with refreshing off-white/grey colourways, partially built with recycled materials and fronted by Kenyan fighting games pro QueenArrow. 
As well as offering a bit of a different look to your standard black-and-red gaming gear, the keyboards, mice and headsets announced also held up well in the brief testing session we were afforded, particularly the keyboards that offered some interesting features on top of solid fundamentals. These units were still pre-production models, but there&#x27;s enough of interest here to mention ahead of their planned release date early next year.  
First up, the SPK8708 full-size mechanical keyboard. Like other high-tier Evnia peripherals, the SPK8708 is a fully wireless model that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, with the former offering lower latency and the latter broader compatibility and longer battery life. Like Philips TVs, it comes with Ambilight branded lighting that spills out behind and around the keyboard, complementing the LEDs behind each keycap. A volume wheel in the upper right corner seemed to have an integrated display inside, which could offer some interesting options along the same lines as the DF-favourite SteelSeries Apex Pro - although it didn&#x27;t seem to be operational in the unit we had access to.

                              <span>No, James Sunderland isn&#x27;t looking at you in the mirror in Silent Hill 2.

                              <span>Disco Elysium&#x27;s lead game designer Robert Kurvitz has filed a lawsuit against developer ZA/UM.


Earlier this month, a number of key members of the development team confirmed they were no longer working at the studio. &quot;The reason for dissolving the cultural organisation is that it no longer represents the ethos it was founded on,&quot; wrote founding member of the ZA/UM cultural association Martin Luiga. &quot;People and ideas are meant to be eternal; organisations may well be temporary.&quot;


Luiga later alleged that some team members were fired on false premises.

The gang used a hidden video camera to record the workings of the card shuffler through a glass window. The images, transmitted to an accomplice outside in the casino parking lot, were played back in slow motion to figure out the sequence of cards in the deck, which was then communicated back to the gamblers inside. The casino lost millions of dollars before the gang were finally caught...</span>

                              <span>EA has promised The Sims fans it &quot;will do better&quot; after its recent Behind The Sims Summit only featured a single &quot;black simmer&quot;.

As part of its first ever Behind the Sims Summit Stream event , EA gave a &quot;super early&quot; look at its next Sims game, codenamed Project Rene, and shared a few future plans for The Sims 4.

However, as first noted by content creator and streamer Ebonix  and amplified by other unhappy players, the presentation - in EA&#x27;s own words - &quot;did not fairly represent our vast community of players&quot;, forcing EA to acknowledge it had &quot;let [players] down&quot;.

Announced during Konami&#x27;s Silent Hill Transmission broadcast, the brief teaser given by No Code creative director Jon McKellan invited fans to analyse the video for clues... so they did.

Whilst there&#x27;s no doubt much more to uncover, fans have discovered that there&#x27;s a SOS signal tucked between the THY FLESH IS WEAK images, whilst a riveting thread on the game&#x27;s subreddit community has discovered text in the spectrogram when converting the trailer to an mp3.

&quot;We want it to happen,&quot; said Isaac. &quot;Be excited. What&#x27;s the script? What&#x27;s the story? What&#x27;s the take? [...] But hopeful that comes to fruition because there&#x27;s so much potential for that.&quot;

Community manager SinfulScribe posted a comment on the game&#x27;s subreddit earlier this week, stating that thanks to &quot;the helpful efforts of the community&quot;, the team had identified the issue and deployed an update to rectify the error.

&quot;Through the helpful efforts of the community, we were alerted to a text description discrepancy with the Blessing of the Worthy Legendary Gem,&quot; they explained. &quot;At a certain rank, the gem&#x27;s description changed from &#x27;maximum life&#x27; to &#x27;current life&#x27; verbiage, leaving players reasonably confused on which of the two descriptions was intended.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players have identified a glitch with a Lucio skin that unwittingly lets other players see where they are.

u/FidgetSpinnetMan recently took to the Overwatch subreddit to report the issue, including an image that shows how Lucio&#x27;s Snow Fox skin and its icy visual effect can be seen from long distances across the map - including through walls (thanks, PCGN). 

&quot;BUG REPORT: I was playing a game and I noticed that the enemy Lucio was visible through the walls,&quot; they wrote in a post that has received two thousand upvotes. &quot;He used the Snow Fox skin and the weapon has smoke coming from it and it seems to be visible through the walls. Don&#x27;t use this skin because it gives you a positional disadvantage at all times.&quot;

                              <span>Silent Hill 2 translator Jeremy Blaustein is asking Konami to credit his work on the original Silent Hill 2 game in the remake, saying &quot;it&#x27;s the right this to do&quot;.

Blaustein says that while he does not &quot;expect or seek any financial compensation&quot;, &quot;I do strongly feel that giving me appropriate credit for my role is the right thing to do&quot;. 

Shortly after the remake was unveiled earlier this week, Blaustein retweeted Konami&#x27;s announcement, saying: &quot;Cool! And they will, once again, use the SH2 English script that I wrote/translated (oh, directed too) completely by myself and I will get zero compensation for it and there will not be tens of thousands of people on Twitter outraged on my behalf. Maybe I should make a video?&quot; The latter sentence refers to a dispute between Konami and Silent Hill 2&#x27;s voice artists around the time Silent Hill HD Collection was released back in 2012.

                              <span>Good news, Resident Evil fans: there&#x27;s still a chance a Resident Evil: Code Veronica remake may happen.

Although Resident Evil 4 producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi was keen to let everyone know that he is thoroughly committed to the Resident Evil 4 remake project for now, when asked by Noisy Pixel if the 22-year-old Resident Evil: Code Veronica may get a similar remake treatment, he said that if the &quot;opportunity comes, maybe&quot;.

Whilst hardly a cast-iron guarantee, it should be welcome news for Resident Evil fans, particularly as Code Veronica was a critical darling at the time and is still considered by some to be the &quot;real&quot; sequel to Resident Evil 2.

In an interview with NME, Sloane talked about his respect for the character&#x27;s original voice actor, Billy Murray, and what it was like to &quot;physically embody&quot; the fan-favourite character.

&quot;Murray did an incredible performance, it was amazing,&quot; Sloane said. &quot;That’s why people give a fuck about Captain Price from the get-go.

You can also make your own custom tracks as demonstrated by Champer Gloomhonk, who has recently shared a new video set to the dulcent sounds of Truss&#x27;s resignation, which you can check out above.

                              <span>Overwatch players have taken to social media to ask why retailers still have Overwatch on sale when the game is no longer playable.

As u/raistwalls1 exemplifies on the Overwatch subreddit (thanks, TheGamer), retailers still have copies of Overwatch for both PS4 and Xbox One on sale - on this occasion, it&#x27;s priced at $34 - even though the game essentially no longer exists.

If you try to run a physical copy of Overwatch now, it&#x27;ll install the game but on launch it will transfer to Overwatch 2 which, crucially, is free to play.

                              <span>Interesting:
A recent study on giant squid that have washed ashore along the Sea of Japan coast has raised the possibility that the animal has a different reproductive method than many other types of squid.
Almost all squid and octopus species are polygamous, with multiple males passing sperm to a single female. Giant squids were thought to have a similar form reproduction.
However, a group led by Professor Noritaka Hirohashi, 57, a professor of reproductive biology in the Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences at Shimane University suspects differently...</span>

                              <span>Machine learning security is extraordinarily difficult because the attacks are so varied—and it seems that each new one is weirder than the next. Here’s the latest: a training-time attack that forces the model to exhibit a point of view: Spinning Language Models: Risks of Propaganda-As-A-Service and Countermeasures.”
Abstract: We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to “spin” their outputs so as to support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view—but only when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization...</span>

Dorfromantik&#x27;s Sakura biome was previously exclusive to the recently released Switch version of the game, and today&#x27;s PC update - appropriately known as the Sakura Update - brings over a number of other features formerly only available on Nintendo&#x27;s platform.


Steam players can now, for instance, enjoy full controller support - which, among other things, helps massively improve what was previously a slightly fiddly experience on Steam Deck.

                              <span>A new Tomb Raider animation canonically explains how Lara Croft survived the events between Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and those of the series&#x27; sixth instalment, Angel of Darkness. 


 The Myth of El Hawa is written by Angel of Darkness scribe Murti Schofield, directed by veteran Tomb Raider fan Ash Kaprielov, and stars voice actress Jonell Elliott (who voiced Lara in several Tomb Raider games including Angel of Darkness and The Last Revelation). 


As for The Myth of El Hawa itself, this is told through Lara&#x27;s diary entries. These reveal how, following her fall into the collapsing temple of Horus at The Last Revelation&#x27;s close, Lara struggled to make her way out alive. However, make her way out she did, and on the brink of death she was found by a shaman named Putai.

Evercade, for those unfamiliar, exists in two version: a home console known as the Evercade VS and the upcoming handheld Evercade EXP. Both are cartridge-based and support a library of 380 officially licensed classic titles, spanning over four decades.


At present, over 30 cartridge collections are available for Evercade, each bundling together a curated selection of retro games usually themed around a single developer - with the likes of Atari, Data East, Intellivision, The Bitmap Brothers, Gremlin, The Oliver Twins, and Interplay all currently represented through various deals.

Discord server voice chat support launched for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in September, making it possible for users to talk with their friends directly through Discord Voice chats, wherever they may be. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a pretty fiddly process in its current guise.


Users first need to link their Xbox and Discord accounts then download the Xbox mobile app to their phone - which must also be linked to a user&#x27;s console. Discord is then launched on mobile or desktop, and once a user has joined the Voice call they want to transfer to Xbox, they need to select the &#x27;transfer call&#x27; option. Next, hit the &#x27;confirm&#x27; button back in the mobile app, at which point it&#x27;s time to don a headset and start chatting via console.

First up, there are the ususal two modes which Sony here refers to as &quot;Favour Resolution&quot; and &quot;Favour Performance&quot;. 


The former sets your frame-rate and resolution to a targeted 30fps at 4K. The latter targets 60fps and uses a dynamic resolution upscaled to 4K.

                              <span>The new third-person mode included in the Winters&#x27; Expansion DLC for Resident Evil Village still won&#x27;t show Ethan&#x27;s face.


As confirmed in last night&#x27;s RE Showcase, Ethan will turn his face away from the player when the camera is turned.



A demo of the game has been released ahead of the expansion release on 28th October, so I was keen to see this for myself.

The Early Access Beta is live now via Steam and the Epic Game Store, and expected on the Microsoft Store &quot;in the coming days&quot;.


Sega&#x27;s full Football Manager 2023 doesn&#x27;t launch until 8th November, but this early access build is basically the full thing, albeit with a warning of some yet-to-be-ironed-out &quot;bugs and issues&quot; still lingering behind the scenes.

                              <span>Will Wright, legendary creator of SimCity and The Sims, has discussed his plans for a metaverse game. 


The project, named Voxverse, will allow players to buy and own land  using cryptocurrency, and mine resources which can then be turned into items for sale.


Wright discussed the project with Axios alongside collaborator Lauren Elliot, the co-creator of Carmen Sandiego. Together, the pair have a blockchain-focused startup working on the game alongside engine maker Unity and NFT game platform Gala Games.

                              <span>Last night brought us our best look yet at Capcom&#x27;s ambitious Resident Evil 4 remake, which Eurogamer&#x27;s editor-in-chief Martin has now got hands-on time with.


In a separate round of interviews, Capcom staff have been discussing the project further - including the original&#x27;s slightly contentious inclusion of button-mashing quick-time events (QTEs).


The good news here is the Resi 4 remake will tone these down - and in-game cut-scenes will no longer force you to quickly pick up the controller and spam a button to avoid death.

Released in 1999 and 2000 respectively, these games launched the popular series that already has two Switch games. They are known for their popular themed boards and frantic minigames.


Both games were among a list of classics confirmed for the subscription service&#x27;s expansion pass. There&#x27;s no news yet on a release date for Goldeneye, however.

In the wake of original Bayonetta voice actress Hellena Taylor releasing a series of videos claiming she was only offered $4k to work on the third game, fans turned on Hale for accepting the role instead. She has since asked for kindness, tweeting &quot;let&#x27;s just be good to each other&quot;.




Platinum has echoed Hale&#x27;s request in its official statement, below in full.

                              <span>Capcom has given perhaps the best look yet at its highly anticipated Resident Evil 4 remake - and shared a little more on its various other Resident Evil projects - in its latest video showcase, with the remake getting both new gameplay footage and a new story trailer.


On the gameplay front, Capcom shared an action-packed couple of minutes of its RE4 remake, starting with a sequence from early in the game that sees protagonist Leon skulking through the woods before stumbling across a seemingly abandoned barn. It&#x27;s a suitably atmospheric sequence, showing off the remake&#x27;s various visual upgrades, and one that segues into a chaotic outdoor battle as Leon is swarmed by Ganado. Inevitably, things come to an end with our old friend chainsaw guy - but Leon somehow manages to keep his head on this time around.


Following its latest gameplay reveal, Capcom discussed the remake in a little more detail, explaining its goal is to &quot;[pay] respect to original game&#x27;s world while implementing new ideas and state of the art graphics to strengthen the core concepts of the title&quot;. This, it say, &quot;will provide a fresh experience with a sense of familiarity if you played the original, that both newcomers and veterans to Resident Evil 4 will enjoy&quot;.

                              <span>Apex Legends&#x27; 15th season, Eclipse, is right around the corner, and the usual promotional blitz is has begun ahead of its 1st November arrival - this time bringing a new cinematic trailer giving a first look at recently revealed new hero Catalyst&#x27;s goopy abilities.


Catalyst - an &quot;experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer&quot;, and the first trans Legend to join the Apex Legends&#x27; line-up - made her introductions earlier this week in a new animated episode of Stories from the Outlands. Here, we got a glimpse of her early years on the planet of Boreas - as she becomes unwittingly embroiled in an eco-terrorist plot to save Boreas&#x27; moon - but developer Respawn&#x27;s latest trailer skips ahead to Catalyst&#x27;s Apex Games debut.


There&#x27;s a lot for eagle-eyed Apex Legends fans to unpack in the new cinematic trailer - including a fair glimpse at what is almost certainly Season 15&#x27;s previously teased new moon map - but the focus is very much on Catalyst and her new abilities.

                              <span>Saturnalia - the striking new survival horror from acclaimed studio Santa Ragione - is free on the Epic Games Store next week, alongside Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.


Santa Ragione, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, previously released the celebrated likes of MirrorMoon EP and Fotonica, but Saturnalia - which is heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia - looks to be its most ambitious title yet, trapping players in an ancient village steeped in murky rituals and challenging them to uncover its many secrets.


Although a solo experience, players take control of four different characters as they investigate the village&#x27;s labyrinthine, and decidedly psychedelic, streets. If one character get captured - horrible things lurk in the shadows - players can switch to another and attempt a rescue, but once all four are dead, the village physically reconfigures itself for another attempt. Thankfully, narrative and puzzle progress is retained across game-overs.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is calling on the public to share its views regarding Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard.


This is the next in the CMA&#x27;s ongoing investigation into the acquisition, which entered Phase 2 at the start of September when the regulator decided the deal required more in-depth scrutiny.


Last week, as part of Phase 2, the CMA released its Issues Statement, detailing the focus of the inquiry&#x27;s second stage and setting out the potential areas of concern - known as &quot;theories of harm&quot; - it&#x27;s investigating. These relate to the acquisition&#x27;s impact on multi-game subscription services, the future of cloud gaming, and the availability of Activision content on rival platforms.

In each of the world&#x27;s warring kingdoms is a Dominant, an individual blessed with the power to summon dangerous Eikons.


The new trailer, called Ambition, introduces two new Dominants: Dion Lesage, the Dominant of Bahamut, and Barnabas Tharmr, The Dominant of Odin. Check it out below.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re chewing over last night&#x27;s Silent Hill: Transmission broadcast, and Konami&#x27;s big plans to relaunch its survival horror brand.

Silent Hill has lain dormant ever since Konami cancelled Silent Hills and unreleased Hideo Kojima&#x27;s PT demo. The question is, will anything announced last night live up to that? There was plenty on offer - a remake, a new game, several spin-offs and a movie - from an array of developers. Still, it often felt like we were seeing little in the way of concrete details - release dates and actual gameplay footage.

Will Konami&#x27;s sudden onslaught of Silent Hill bring about a fresh start for the series? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy discuss.

                              <span>Destiny developer Bungie is reportedly working on a revival of its long-dormant Marathon series. 


This new Marathon project will take the form of a three-person squad-based extraction shooter, Insider-gaming reports, and is currently in a pre-alpha state. 


Perhaps unsurprisingly, there&#x27;s also suggestion of this new Marathon game being run as a live service, with season rewards and progression worked in. Eurogamer has contacted Bungie for comment.

                              <span>Battlefield 2042&#x27;s latest update arrives today, and tweaks yet another map. 


Update 2.2 reworks Orbital in a similar manner to how September&#x27;s patch reworked the (appropriately named) Renewal. Here, Battlefield developer DICE says it has &quot;improved gameplay flow&quot; and added more cover and assets, as well as various terrain improvements.


Another big addition to this update is that of persistent servers for Battlefield Portal, so your server will always remain available within the game&#x27;s server browser - even when there are no active players.

                              <span>Super Smash Bros. 64 began life as a tech demo for a four-player free-for-all fighting game called Dragon King: The Fighting Game.


In the latest video in his YouTube series, series creator Masahiro Sakurai revealed new details on the conception of the first game in Nintendo&#x27;s hit fighting franchise and showed never before seen footage.


After the release of Kirby Super Star on the SNES, Sakurai began work on two different concepts: one, the fighting game that became Smash, and two a stealth-focused RC robot adventure game in which players hacked security cameras to progress.

                              <span>In light of the Queen&#x27;s passing, the team behind the upcoming Fallout: London mod for Fallout 4 has chosen to remove her &#x27;likeness&#x27;, and that of King Charles&#x27;, from development.
In a new progress video for the mod, project lead Dean Carter stated: &quot;We have always maintained that if [The Queen] was to pass away before the mod was complete, we would change it. As such, here is the official announcement to notify you all that, we are changing it&quot; (thanks, PC Gamer).
Carter did not elaborate on what the Fallout London team was going to change this all to, instead saying fans would have to hold tight and be patient on this front. He was quite adamant, however, the team would not bring  back its ghoulish Royal Family members in the future.

                              <span>The producer of Cyberpunk Edgerunners (and CD Projekt Red&#x27;s Japan country manager) Satoru Honma has confirmed that the anime is a &quot;standalone work&quot;.


In an interview with Famitsu (reported by PushSquare), Honma stated that a second season was not in the works.



&quot;I personally would like to continue to work with Japanese studios to produce more anime in the future, partly because we have received very good feedback. However, just to be clear, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was planned as a standalone work, so there&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;we are actually working on Season 2 in the background&#x27;,&quot; he said.

Scar&#x27;s arrival lets you hang out with the British-voiced baddie and extend Dreamlight&#x27;s overall narrative - which has you trying to puzzle out why its eponymous valley has fallen into ruin.


To get started with Scar, you&#x27;ll just need to head over to the giant skull in the elephant graveyard - which has now opened up to reveal a fresh lair.

This free update will add the long-awaited campaign network co-op mode, as well as the official launch of the game&#x27;s Forge beta (in case you missed it, some have already got their hands on it and have been creating some truly impressive reimaginings of games such as Ocarina of Time and PT within). 


In the campaign&#x27;s upcoming co-op mode, you will be able to have a whirl around Halo Infinite&#x27;s story with up to three other fellow Spartans. This will also be supported with the Mission Replay feature (finally), and 343 has revealed there will now be another 24 achievements to unlock in the game. As a reminder, this is not the local split-screen co-op, which the developer previously announced it had cancelled altogether.

WhatsApp uses the Signal encryption protocol to provide encryption for its messages. That was absolutely a visionary choice that Brian and his team led back in the day ­- and big props to them for doing that. But you can’t just look at that and then stop at message protection. WhatsApp does not protect metadata the way that Signal does. Signal knows nothing about who you are. It doesn’t have your profile information and it has introduced group encryption protections.

Server-side apply (SSA) has now
been GA for a few releases, and I
have found myself in a number of conversations, recommending that people / teams
in various situations use it. So I’d like to write down some of those reasons.
Obvious (and not-so-obvious) benefits of SSA
A list of improvements / niceties you get from switching from various things to
Server-side apply!
Versus client-side-apply (that is, plain kubectl apply):

The system gives you conflicts when you accidentally fight with another
actor over the value of a field!

                              <span>As part of the Silent Hill: Transmission stream this evening, a new game known simply as Silent Hill f was announced. This marks the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade.


There are still very few details about this particular entry to the Silent Hill franchise. We do know its story is by Ryukishi07 (who created the When They Cry visual novel series), its characters and creatures are designed by Kera and its producer is Motoi Okamoto, whose name you may recognise from Nintendo.
Development duties are being handled by Neobards Entertainment, which has previously worked with Capcom as a support studio on several its Resident Evil games including Re:Verse.

                              <span>Konami finally unveiled everything it has cooking with Silent Hill, including a much-rumoured remake, a new movie and even brand new games in the famous horror series. In case you missed it, here&#x27;s a roundup of everything announced during the Silent Hill showcase, dubbed &#x27;Silent Hill Transmission&#x27;, including all the trailers.


First up, we got a debut trailer for Bloober Team&#x27;s much-rumoured Silent Hill 2 remake, which is set for PC via Steam and PlayStation 5. It&#x27;s listed as a PlayStation console exclusive for 12 months, which suggests it will hit Xbox a year after launch.


Next came the reveal of Silent Hill Townfall, developed by Stories Untold and Observation maker No Code alongside Annapurna Interactive. This one remains something of a mystery. Expect more in the new year.

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s big Silent Hill announcement bonanza wasn&#x27;t just about video games. Oh no. 


Alongside an array of Silent Hill game projects to look forward to, you should also be aware of a new Silent Hill film, set to follow the 2006 original that starred Sean Bean. 


Return to Silent Hill is the movie project we&#x27;ve heard whispers of previously from the original film&#x27;s director Christophe Gans. Tonight, Konami assistant producer Rui Naito confirmed this big screen follow-up was very much a thing that was happening - and indeed that it has actually been the &quot;catalyst&quot; for the new wave of Silent Hill games coming to fruition.

                              <span>After what feels like an eternity of leaks, Konami has officially revived its long-dormant Silent Hill series with a flurry of activity, starting with remake of horror masterpiece Silent Hill 2, which is being developed by Bloober Team for PC and PS5 as a timed console exclusive.


Bloober Team - the studio behind the likes of The Medium, Layers of Fear, and Observer - has been rumoured to be involved in a Silent Hill revival as far back as June last year, when it announced a partnership with Konami to create a new game. Rumours that the project would be a Silent Hill 2 remake began to coalesce following a series of leaks earlier this year.


Now, though, Konami and Bloober Team have made things official, revealing the remake during a busy Silent-Hill-focused livestream in a two-and-a-half minute trailer. Here, we were shown some iconic Silent Hill 2 moments given a new-gen visual overhaul - extending to a slightly dubious makeover for protagonist James Sunderland, who now looks a little like Alan Wake&#x27;s unpopular brother.

                              <span>As part of tonight&#x27;s Silent Hill: Transmission stream, a new project called Silent Hill: Townfall was announced.

Not much has been revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie. &quot;Why are you here?&quot; he asks. &quot;Here to be punished... That&#x27;s good I like it. I think we&#x27;ve done something so awful that we are stuck here in this place being judged by these... people,&quot; he continues. 

The trailer ends with some frames of a man wearing glasses, before cutting to the logo of the game.

                              <span>Join us tonight for the long-awaited reveal of what&#x27;s next for Silent Hill, as Konami unveils all in a showcase set to begin this evening at 10pm UK time. 
So, what do we expect? The rumour mill has certainly been churning, and it seems likely we&#x27;ll see Konami pull back the curtain on a number of Silent Hill projects set to bring back the survival horror franchise in a big way. There&#x27;s been word of a Silent Hill remake alongside all-new titles, and even a new Silent Hill movie.
How many games are we getting? Has Sony snaffled them all under some kind of timed exclusivity? Are they actuall all for mobile? We&#x27;ll find out in just a couple of hours.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s current Call of Duty marketing deal &quot;restricts&quot; Activision&#x27;s big-budget shooter series from appearing in Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft has claimed.


The detail comes from Xbox&#x27;s full response to last week&#x27;s filing by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, in which the regulator raised its current concerns regarding Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing $68bn takeover attempt of Activision Blizzard.

Sony&#x27;s existing marketing deal with Call of Duty sees the PlayStation branding used in conjunction with advertising, while players on Sony platforms get early access to in-game content.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been holding out for a Steam release of Crytek&#x27;s Crysis Remastered Trilogy, there&#x27;s some good news; the three-game spruce up is coming to Valve&#x27;s storefront on 17th November.


The Crysis Remastered Trilogy, if this all seems a little like déjà vu, first released for PlayStation, Switch, and PC last October, but the PC version was limited to the Epic Games Store - despite the remaster of the original Crysis already having been launched on Steam.


Come November, though, Steam players will also have the opportunity to check out Crytek&#x27;s remasters of Crysis 2 and 3, with all three games bundled into one package featuring various tweaks and enhancements for their respective single-player campaigns.

                              <span>Yesterday, I popped over to The Trafford Centre to check out Pokémon: Art Through the Ages.


The event, which was announced last month, is styled as a treasure hunt and requires you to look around The Trafford Centre for pictures and paintings of Pokémon. It features all 151 species from the Kanto Pokédex, with some small activities dotted around to get you exploring.


For anyone who&#x27;s not aware of The Trafford Centre (TTC), it&#x27;s a big shopping and leisure complex in Manchester. As well as shops, there&#x27;s also an Odeon, a Namco Funscape, and even a Sea Life aquarium and Legoland Discovery Centre.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly building an Xbox mobile gaming store in direct competition with Apple and Google.


The news, as reported by The Verge, has emerged due to filings from the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.




Both the popularity of Activision&#x27;s mobile games and the inclusion of King are major factors in Microsoft&#x27;s buyout as it looks to expand the Xbox brand further into mobile gaming.

Now, as a touching tribute to the designer&#x27;s work and legacy, many fans have taken to Fallout 76 to express their sorrow at his passing, and to bid him farewell.


Sharing on Twitter using the hashtag &quot;ThanksFerret&quot;, fans have created in-game homages to Baudoin.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3 voice actress Jennifer Hale has asked fans to be kinder following online abuse.


The furore around the game&#x27;s voice actresses has been raised once more after new claims surfaced disputing that original Bayonetta voice actress Hellena Taylor was offered just $4k to work on the third game.




The debate has fired up both passion and negativity on all sides: towards Taylor, Platinum Games, and Hale, who was somewhat unwittingly dragged into the fiasco.

                              <span>Blizzard&#x27;s Albany-based band of Diablo testers have won the right to form a union.


Their petition to the US National Labor Relations Board has now been accepted, setting the stage for a vote by employees to formalise the process. Ballots will be sent out as soon as next week, Kotaku reported, with a result due on 18th November.


Activision Blizzard had previously argued against this process going ahead, and claimed it should be a decision made by a larger group of employees at the Albany studio rather than its testing team. Ultimately, the NLRB disagreed.

                              <span>The recommended PC specs for Gotham Knights have been confirmed, ahead of the game&#x27;s release on Friday, and have raised eyebrows for some of their requirements.

The specs were shared on Twitter last night, just days before the game&#x27;s launch this Friday. 

The game&#x27;s Steam listing has been updated to reflect the specs, alongside the minimum requirements for PC which publisher Warner Bros. previously confirmed earlier in the week.

                              <span>Ahead of its imminent release, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 team has detailed its all-important PC specs.


In addition to these specs, Infinity Ward has also announced those who pre-ordered the game digitally will be able to get their preloads on the go from today (19th October). This will in turn offer up those eight days of early campaign access announced in August, which will go live tomorrow.


Meanwhile, preloading for the full release (which, unlike the early access mentioned above, will include the multiplayer and Special Ops elements) can begin from the 26th October ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch on the 27th/28th, depending on where you are playing.

Responding last night to some confusion over the game&#x27;s release date, the official Callisto Protocol account on Twitter reconfirmed the space survival horror&#x27;s 2nd December launch. 


&quot;And yes, we&#x27;ll have a 60 FPS performance mode,&quot; the tweet added.

Banks don’t take millions of dollars and put them in plastic bags and hang them on the wall so everybody can walk right up to them. But we do basically the same thing in museums and hang the assets right out on the wall. So it’s our job, then, to either use technology or develop technology that protects the art, to hire honest guards that are trainable and able to meet the challenge and alert and so forth. And we have to keep them alert because it’s the world’s most boring job. It might be great for you to go to a museum and see it for a day, but they stand in that same gallery year after year, and so they get mental fatigue. And so we have to rotate them around and give them responsibilities that keep them stimulated and keep them fresh...</span>

                              <span>As Netflix&#x27;s gaming strategy grows ever bolder following its first tentative steps into the market, the streaming service has now revealed it&#x27;s &quot;seriously exploring&quot; its own cloud gaming offering.


That&#x27;s according to Netflix&#x27;s vice president of gaming Mike Verdu, who, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt (thanks TechCrunch), explained the company saw the technology as &quot;a value add&quot; for subscribers. &quot;We&#x27;re not asking you to subscribe as a console replacement. It&#x27;s a completely different business model. The hope is over time that it just becomes this very natural way to play games where wherever you are.&quot;


Addressing the elephant in the room - the dramatic failure of Google&#x27;s game streaming service Stadia, which will cease operations in January, a little over three years after its initial launch - Verdu noted that while Stadia was a &quot;technical success&quot; and was &quot;fun to play games on&quot;, &quot;it had some issues with the business model.&quot;

If your answer is &#x27;Guildford High Street&#x27;, then, hey, you&#x27;re in luck, as fearless space explorers can now visit west Surrey&#x27;s most glamorous locale in No Man&#x27;s Sky.


Perhaps, first, a quick introduction for those who&#x27;ve yet to experienced the marvels of Guildford High Street for themselves; it&#x27;s the epicentre of a small town situated around 40 miles south-west of London that just so happens to be a thriving hub for the UK&#x27;s game development scene.


Poke around and you&#x27;ll find the likes of Supermassive, Media Molecule, EA, Room developer Fireproof Games, Criterion, Ubisoft - and, of course, No Man&#x27;s Sky developer Hello Games.

                              <span>New reports have emerged disputing claims made by original Bayonetta voice actor Hellena Taylor that developer PlatinumGames was only willing to offer her a total of $4k to reprise her role in the series&#x27; upcoming third instalment.


Taylor - who has been replaced by voice actor Jennifer Hale for Bayonetta 3 - made the claim in a series of emotional videos shared on Twitter this weekend, citing Platinum&#x27;s &quot;insulting [pay] offer&quot; as the reason for her absence in the third game.


&quot;I didn&#x27;t want the world, I didn&#x27;t ask for too much,&quot; she said in one video. &quot;I was just asking for a decent, dignified living wage. What they did was legal, but it was immoral.&quot; Taylor also called for a boycott of Bayonetta 3, suggesting fans instead donated their money to charity.

                              <span>As part of its first ever Behind the Sims Summit Stream event, EA has given a &quot;super early&quot; look at its next Sims game, codenamed Project Rene, and shared a few future plans for The Sims 4.


Project Rene - a name EA says it chose to reflect words like &quot;renewal, renaissance, rebirth&quot; - is described as a &quot;next generation Sims game and creative platform&quot; that will &quot;[reimagine] the Sims you know and love with new ways to play&quot;.


It&#x27;s said to be built on a foundation of &quot;charming sims, powerful tools, and meaningful stories&quot; that will stay true to previous Sims games while also &quot;pushing to evolve how those Sims think and behave, [pushing] tools even further when creating and customising, and [exploring] innovative ways to not only tell stories but to collaborate on those stories or creations with your closest friends across your favourite devices.&quot;

What that actually means in practice isn&#x27;t immediately clear from the trailer&#x27;s rapid cuts and overbearing stylings, but EA sheds more light on the matter in an accompanying press release.


&quot;In Need for Speed Unbound,&quot; it explains, &quot;players have to take risks to get to the top. Choose how and when to put it all on the line, pulling huge drifts on the street, outdriving the cops, or placing side bets with their own earnings against rival racers.&quot;

                              <span>Warner Bros. has announced a new role-playing Mortal Kombat game for mobile. 


Developed by NetherRealm Studios and known as Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, this game will make its debut in 2023 and provide users with their first &quot;mobile-exclusive cinematic story experience&quot; for the series. 


On its release next year, players will be tasked with building up their team of fighters (of which there will be a &quot;vast roster&quot; of characters to pick from) in a bid to stop a &quot;dark and dangerous threat from wreaking havoc across the realms.&quot; This will all be done via real-time group battles.

                              <span>Xbox Elite Series 2 controllers can now be customised in the Xbox Design Lab.


Since 2016, the lab has allowed players to design their own controllers with personal colour combinations - body, buttons, triggers, sticks and more.


Until now this has only been available for the standard controllers, but now the service is available for the premium Elite Series 2 that boasts adjustable thumbsticks, triggers, a rubberised grip, 40 hours of rechargeable battery life, and more.

Sony&#x27;s service - now part of the newly-revamped PS Plus Premium, though formerly the separate PlayStation Now subscription - has been home to Red Dead Redemption since 2016.


Its departure means there is now no way to play Rockstar&#x27;s original cowboy epic on PS4 or PS5.

In a recent Q&amp;A with director Todd Howard, details were given on the game&#x27;s trait system. Each trait comes with positives and negatives, as well as an accompanying side quest to remove them.



As PCGamesN spotted, one of these traits is called &quot;Hero Worshipped&quot; in which the player has &quot;earned the attention of an annoying &#x27;Adoring Fan&#x27; who will show up randomly and jabber at you incessantly. On the plus side, he&#x27;ll give you gifts...&quot;  See for yourself in the below video at the 3:17 mark.

                              <span>EA has updated its Online Service Shutdown page, detailing several of its titles losing online features in the near future. 


On 9th November, both Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars for Xbox 360 (including its Kane&#x27;s Wrath expansion) will see their online services shut  down. 
Red Alert 3, as I am sure you are all aware, is most famous for Tim Curry&#x27;s exuberant proclamation that he&#x27;s headed to space as it is the one place not corrupted by capitalism. That&#x27;s always a fun clip to replay.

                              <span>Rare&#x27;s classic Nintendo 64 shooter Perfect Dark has been decompiled, meaning PC ports and mods will now be possible.


Coder Ryan Dwyer is behind this, working on both the launch NTSC version and a later re-release that fixed various bugs (thanks VGC).


We can now expect PC players to have plenty of fun improving the visuals of the game, or simply messing around with Joanna Dark, Elvis the alien and more.

Business Insider reported that hundreds - but less than 1000 - staff have been affected. 


&quot;Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis, and make structural adjustments accordingly,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson told Eurogamer today. &quot;We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead.&quot;

As detailed on Twitter, the publisher will be broadcasting its latest Resident Evil showcase via Twitch this Thursday, with proceedings set to get underway at 11pm UK time - which, if you&#x27;re watching from the US, equates to 3pm PDT and 6pm EDT.


Capcom hasn&#x27;t shared much in the way of specifics, only saying it&#x27;ll be detailing the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition - which arrives on 28th October, bundling together the base game and upcoming Winters Expansion DLC  - as well as its Resident Evil 4 remake, and &quot;more&quot;.

                              <span>In the not entirely unlikely event you&#x27;ve been clamouring for a bit more jazz in your Elden Ring soundtrack, Bandai Namco has the answer. It&#x27;s announced it&#x27;ll be hosting a live concert this December that, for those in the US willing to pay for it, will be streamed online.


Elden Ring: A Night in the Lands Between, as the event will be known, is a collaboration between Bandai Namco, award-winning musician Kenny Garrett, and Takuya Kuroda. It promises &quot;recognisable melodies from the game&#x27;s soundtrack... performed live in Jazz format - with improvisation&quot; by a group of musicians lead by Garrett on alto sax and Kuroda on trumpet.


&quot;While video game soundtracks have seen variations as symphonic music and even Rock n&#x27; Roll, our &#x27;A Night in the Lands Between&#x27; Jazz event is exploring a wonderfully different treatment of the Elden Ring soundtrack&quot;, wrote Bandai Namco&#x27;s senior director of esports and live entertainment Wataru Nakasuji in a statement accompanying today&#x27;s announcement.

Details of the new season, which Respawn is calling Eclipse, are a little light at present, but the developer&#x27;s newly launched Season 15 webpage promises a new map - said to be lie &quot;in Boreas&#x27; shadow&quot; - as well as a new gifting feature, enabling players to purchase and send cosmetic items to their friends.


For now, though, the focus is very much on new hero Catalyst, real name Tressa Smith, described as a &quot;experienced terraformer and defensive conjurer  [who] uses her remarkable control of ferrofluid to manipulate the battlefield.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has announced it&#x27;ll be bringing its Switch Sports servers back online tomorrow, 18th October, with players affected by the recent downtime getting an extra week added to their Nintendo Switch Online membership.


Switch Sports&#x27; servers were taking offline and save data backups were suspended on Friday, while Nintendo investigated a significant bug introduced in last week&#x27;s 1.2.1 update that caused crashes on the game&#x27;s pre-match loading screen, during both online and offline play.


Servers and save data backup functionality have remained unavailable since then, but Nintendo Japan has now offered an update on its website (thanks VGC), confirming the crashing was caused by a save writing error under certain conditions and revealing it&#x27;ll be restoring all functionality across two waves later this week.

                              <span>PQube and Toge Productions have come to a financial agreement following a disagreement over the use of funds.


Back in August, Coffee Talk developer Toge Productions accused publisher PQube of misusing money gained from a diversity fund. Toge claimed this money was intended to finance its next game A Space For The Unbound.



&quot;The diversity fund was a grant fund intended to help underrepresented game developers, especially during the pandemic,&quot; Toge Productions wrote at the time. &quot;However, instead of giving those funds to the developers as the grant was intended, PQube Games intentionally withheld information about the grant and used it as a leverage for their own commercial gain.

Each item in this collection has been influenced by the game, with elements such as Forbidden West&#x27;s key art and homages to Aloy&#x27;s in-game looks included throughout each piece.

Beyond being a test for players with a buffed-up Pokémon team, Elite Raids also seem like Pokémon Go developer Niantic&#x27;s latest nudge to get users back outside in big numbers, generating the kind of crowds you might see playing pre-pandemic.


The first evidence of Elite Raids began popping up in-game on Friday, with an extended 24-hour countdown clock on some Pokémon gyms and a flashy new raid egg on the game&#x27;s map. A message stated these raids would require players to take part in-person at the raid site itself, rather than using a Remote Raid Pass to join from the sofa.

                              <span>Twitch streamer Adriana Chechik, who broke her back in two places at TwichCon San Diego, is now out of hospital following a second round of surgery.


The incident occurred at a Gladiators-style foam pit stand sponsored by Lenovo, where Chechik jumped into the pit and was left severely injured. Several others were also injured.


Chechik has been sharing updates on her recovery on social media, confirming she had a second round of surgery on 14th October - almost a week after the incident.

                              <span>This weekend saw Minecraft developer Mojang make numerous announcements as part of its annual Minecraft Live celebration - including the first details of 2023&#x27;s big vanilla Minecraft update.


But in a change to tradition, we didn&#x27;t get a title for the update or its full list of additions - in response to the fact Mojang has  struggled in the past to deliver everything it has previously promised. 


For now, Minecraft&#x27;s 2023 update is being referred to as &quot;Minecraft 1.20&quot;, and is confirmed to feature camels, hanging signs, chiseled bookshelves and bamboo crafting - including the ability to build a bamboo raft. Camels look a particularly interesting addition - as they can jump fair distances and fit two players riding on top.

                              <span>Gotham Knights will be limited to 30FPS and not include a performance mode for consoles on its release later this month. 


This news was confirmed by Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer Fleur Marty via Discord. Here, Marty explained this was &quot;due to the types of features&quot; included in the game, adding the additional option of a performance mode would not have been &quot;as straightforward as lowering the resolution and getting a higher FPS&quot;.


Marty highlighted the game&#x27;s &quot;highly detailed&quot; open-world setting and its untethered co-op gameplay as two of the reasons the upcoming game does not &quot;have a performance/quality toggle option&quot;. She concluded by confirming Gotham Knights will run at 30FPS on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 (the developer previously confirmed it had canned the planned PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game).

                              <span>Konami horror project P.T. has been made playable on a PlayStation 5, via a hacked PS4 emulator.


Streamer and dataminer Lance McDonald has managed to get the game working on a non-jailbroken PS5 console.


Essentially, a legitimate copy of P.T. is required as well as an active PSN account on both a jailbroken PS5 and a normal, fully updated PS5. The emulator is then transferred from one to the other.

&quot;As a longtime member of the voice acting community,&quot; Hale wrote on Twitter, &quot;I support every actor&#x27;s right to be paid well and have advocated consistently for this for years.


&quot;Anyone who knows me or has followed my career, will know that I have great respect for my peers, and that I am an advocate for all members of the community.

                              <span>Suspected members of a European car-theft ring have been arrested:
The criminals targeted vehicles with keyless entry and start systems, exploiting the technology to get into the car and drive away.
As a result of a coordinated action carried out on 10 October in the three countries involved, 31 suspects were arrested. A total of 22 locations were searched, and over EUR 1 098 500 in criminal assets seized.
The criminals targeted keyless vehicles from two French car manufacturers. A fraudulent tool—marketed as an automotive diagnostic solution, was used to replace the original software of the vehicles, allowing the doors to be opened and the ignition to be started without the actual key fob...</span>

                              <span>Developer Media Molecule&#x27;s impressively flexible PlayStation creation tool Dreams is celebrating Halloween this year with the return of its annual All Hallows&#x27; event, this time beckoning players to take a spooky trip to the Land of Lost Dreams.


This latest journey to the realms of spookidom is the third Halloween event for Dreams, following previous outings that saw Media Molecule collaborating with its community to create explorable haunted houses and then, last year, a creepy old fairground.


Things are getting a little more fantastical this time around, however, with a quest to the far-flung Land of Lost Dreams, where players can embark on a quest full of odd characters and puzzles as they attempt to uncover a &quot;rich and unnerving history&quot;.

Switch Sports&#x27; version 1.2.1 update launched earlier this week, aiming to further strengthen measures against what Nintendo called &quot;disruptive behaviours&quot; online, as well as pledging to suspend any online players violating its Community Guidelines. Punishable actions included &quot;fraudulent behaviour such as save data manipulation.&quot;


Unfortunately, patch 1.2.1 also introduced a significant bug causing crashes - whether playing online or offline - during the pre-match loading screen.

Finding The Flowzone, as the new expansion is known, takes OlliOlli World&#x27;s acclaimed skating action high above Radlandia, with players roaming the clouds in a fantastical floating boat alongside the infamous Radmospheric Three - &quot;grizzled sea-dog Captain Squid, the prim and proper Professor Planks, and the mystically inclined Christopher Licht&quot;. 


Ultimately, the goal is to reach the fabled city of Radlantis, meet the legendary Gail Force, and compete before the Skate Godz to earn the Radlantis Rivals Cup. First, though, players must complete courses set among the clouds, with some familiar Radlandia sights providing the backdrop.

                              <span>&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it&#x27;s not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we&#x27;re pressing the &#x27;unlaunch&#x27; button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th,&quot; says Nvidia, in a remarkable new blog post that effectively calls a halt to the upcoming launch of its most contentious of RTX 4000 releases, hinting that it&#x27;ll be renamed when it does eventually re-emerge. RTX 4070 Ti anyone?
Unveiled by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on September 20th, the RTX 4000 line of graphics hardware is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, fabricated on TSMC&#x27;s 4nm process. The flagship GPU - the GeForce RTX 4090 - released a couple of days ago and was lauded for its massive generational leap over the existing RTX 3000 flagships, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. However, it&#x27;s fair to say that the same level of acclaim and anticipation was not bestowed upon the RTX 4080, announced in two very different flavours.
The table below reveals that the spec differential wasn&#x27;t just about the amount of onboard VRAM: each RTX 4080 model was based on an entirely different core processor, with wild variations in the amount of CUDA codes (compute power) and memory bandwidth. In effect, two very different graphics cards were being sold under the same name at very different price-points.

                              <span>EA Motive has been uncommonly talkative throughout the development of its Dead Space remake, with the studio hosting various livestreams to show off the likes of its improved art, audio, and gameplay changes - but now, with the game&#x27;s 27th January launch inching ever nearer, we&#x27;ve had our clearest look yet at how all those elements will come together, courtesy of a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough.


Hot on the heels of last week&#x27;s 2-minute gameplay trailer, EA celebrated Dead Space&#x27;s 14th anniversary today with an extended sequence from the remake&#x27;s third chapter, in which protagonist Isaac must explore the infested USG Ishimura in order to reach the ship&#x27;s engineering deck take and repair its engines.


The sequence began in Ishimura&#x27;s hanger - an area that&#x27;s now much bigger than it was in the original (a side-by-side comparison made the differences abundantly clear) - with players now able to zero-g their way around the area. Some of remake&#x27;s environmental changes have been made to enhance the atmosphere, while other were required to accommodate the fact the Ishimura is now one seamless, interconnected ship, with players no longer needed to rely on the tram to get around.

                              <span>Pokémon Go&#x27;s annual Halloween event is often one of its best activities and, as expected, this year features a number of new bits and pieces in-game. The event&#x27;s first half, running from October 20th to 27th, features the arrival of Mega Banette in Mega Raids for the first time, plus the Shiny versions of Noibat and Galarian Yamask. But it also offers some more surprising additions. 


 These include the decision by developer Niantic to sell not one but two cheap event tickets featuring time-limited quests and rewards, with both a $1 and $5 option available. From the sounds of things, these will each offer different rewards, with the former offering encounters with Yamask, while the pricier option gets you an admittedly very cool animated Halloween lantern avatar item/pose.


Niantic is obviously trying something new here with a pair of different ticket options for the same overall event, as well as the fact these rewards will be time-limited - even if you paid. Typically, event questlines from Special Research remain in-game permanently, allowing you to complete them at your leisure.

                              <span>After eight years, the Destiny franchise is moving on from its various destination materials - the Spinmetal, Helium Filaments and Relic Iron you could zoom around on your Sparrow vehicle and harvest while patrolling the series&#x27; many planets and moons.


Some of my earliest memories from Destiny 1 are of looping the Cosmodrome for Spinmetal Leaves, hopping off my Sparrow to gather them, then heading off to the next node. Levelling your gear - which in turn levels your character - required plugging bits of these resources in, and I don&#x27;t want to think about the number of hours I spent grinding these out.


Now, or rather as of Destiny 2&#x27;s upcoming Season 19, the materials themselves will no longer be available to acquire - although you can still go zooming around on your Sparrow if you want to.

As Serebii.net reports, the Wild Area News will receive a final update on 1st November to add Pokémon not usually available, such as Gigantamax Snorlax.


Also, from this date the Battle Stadium will no longer update with a ranked season and results will not appear in Pokémon Home.

                              <span>Today brings another new Pokémon set to debut in the upcoming Scarlet and Violet games for Nintendo Switch:  Bellibolt, an electric-type frog.

A couple of days ago, a teaser was released where Iono, a new gym leader character described as an influencer and livestreamer within the Pokémon universe, asked viewers to guess what her partner Pokémon was.

We were given the following clues: appearance-wise it&#x27;s squishy, sluggish with an easygoing vibe, and has &quot;two big ol&#x27; bumps on its noggin that people always mistake for eyes&quot;. And it&#x27;s &quot;so cute&quot;, according to Iono.

The project is being lead by Dominic Guay, a 20-year veteran of Ubisoft who worked on Splinter Cell before rising to become senior producer of Watch Dogs and its sequel.


Invoke owner and D&amp;D publisher Wizards of the Coast announced the new project this week with only a few details: that it will have a triple-A scope, and be developed on the Unreal 5 engine.

In its latest developer blog post, Blizzard detailed its &quot;current thinking on hero balance and gameplay&quot;, including map rotation and player ranking.


&quot;While some heroes are performing better than others, and there are differences across player skill levels, we have been happy to see that no hero&#x27;s overall power level is far out of line with our goals,&quot; Blizzard said.

Baby Shark, the children&#x27;s song that went viral a few years ago thanks to South Korean educational entertainment company Pinkfong, is getting an &quot;open-world adaptation&quot;.

The game will be a collaboration between Baby Shark Games, a subsidiary of Pinkfong, and Retro Future, a developer who specialises in pixel games.

As shared via Nintendo of America&#x27;s own Twitter, this latest foray into the world of Mario inspired timepieces introduces us to two new watches. 


The first is the standard Chronograph, which is limited to 3000 pieces. This watch features several Mario Kart references across its face, including icons of Power Stars and the like where you would usually see the date showing up. Meanwhile, the Mario Kart logo can be seen etched on the back.

What&#x27;s more, references have been found to two new maps that don&#x27;t yet exist in the game.

                              <span>New Call of Duty players on PC will still need to verify their identity via an SMS message - even though Activision&#x27;s other half Blizzard rolled back the unpopular requirement for Overwatch 2 following its beleaguered launch.


In a new blog post, Activision confirmed it would require a text-enabled mobile phone number to play the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on PC, and also Warzone 2.0.


This will not apply on console, however, or to anyone on PC who verified their account to play the existing Warzone previously.

Key, who studied theatre at university, has sung on-screen previously in the TV series Schmigadoon! and Netflix&#x27;s Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey.

ORIGINAL STORY 11.45am UK:
Silent Hill is an unsettling series across the board, there&#x27;s no denying that - and the silhouette of its fan-favourite Pyramid Head is enough to induce nightmares. 


Now we know more about how this monstrous humanoid came to be, at least in terms of his conception - and it turns out he was inspired by background characters from the 1995 film Braveheart.

The game&#x27;s developer Asobo has now warned those with early copies not to ruin Requiem&#x27;s story - posting a picture of a knight being consumed by thousands of plague rats as a warning of what will happen should you spoil things for others.


Digital copies of the game will unlock at midnight local time next Tuesday, 18th October, but it appears some early physical copies have been sent out early. Eurogamer has spotted some big spoilers doing the rounds - so be careful where you click if you want to go in blind.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re back discussing Microsoft&#x27;s big Activision Blizzard deal and the latest developments in the ongoing saga of the $68bn buyout being finalised.

Yesterday, Microsoft leapt upon the latest concerned update from the UK&#x27;s deal regulator and repeatedly tried to minimise its own importance in the video games market. Microsoft stated it was far from the leader in terms of console share and PC games sold, and lacked any real presence on mobile devices. In a particularly eye-opening claim, Microsoft even said PlayStation&#x27;s userbase would be &quot;significantly larger&quot; than Xbox even if every COD player ditched Sony. At the same time, Microsoft also criticised the regulator for appearing to take Sony&#x27;s own complaints about the deal at face value. 

Is this fighting talk from Microsoft, or squeaky bum time in Redmond over real concerns the UK will block the deal outright? Tom Phillips, Victoria Kennedy, Ishraq Subhan and Liv Ngan share their thoughts on whether the deal will go through, what changes  Microsoft could make to get it over the finish line, and whether it should go ahead.

                              <span>In August, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the cryptocurrency platform Tornado Cash, a virtual currency “mixer” designed to make it harder to trace cryptocurrency transactions—and a worldwide favorite money-laundering platform. Americans are now forbidden from using it. According to the US government, Tornado Cash was sanctioned because it allegedly laundered over $7 billion in cryptocurrency, $455 million of which was stolen by a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.
Tornado Cash is not a traditional company run by human beings, but instead a series of “smart contracts”: self-executing code that exists only as software. ...</span>

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence, the new narrative adventure from developer Dramatic Labs, will no longer release this year as originally planned and is now expected to arrive on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation in April 2023.


Resurgence, which was announced at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, takes place after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, telling its story from the alternating perspectives of two different characters - First Officer Jara Rydek and Engineering Crewperson Carter Diaz - with gameplay said to consist of playable cinematic sequences.


Everything shown so far points to an experience very much in the same vein as the interactive narrative adventures pioneered by Telltale Games - which isn&#x27;t particularly surprising given that Dramatic Labs was founded by controversial former Telltale Games boss Kevin Bruner, and includes around 20 former Telltale employees.

                              <span>Journey developer ThatGameCompany is doing something a little bit different for the latest season of its gorgeous social adventure Sky: Children of Light, launching a &quot;first-of-its-kind musical experience&quot; in collaboration with Norwegian musician and artist, Aurora.


Aurora - who performed the haunting vocal accompaniment to Idina Menzel in Frozen 2&#x27;s showstopper Into the Unknown, and whose singles include Cure for Me and Runaway - has been heard in Sky before, but she&#x27;ll play a much greater role in its latest season of content.


Appropriately titled Season of Aurora, this will feature a &quot;story told in music&quot; where players can explore the &quot;song-filled memories of Spirits who carried hope through struggle and loss&quot;.

                              <span>If you can somehow still look at your gaming backlog without being consumed by existential dread, here&#x27;s another two additions for your infinitely expanding pile: Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition and Evoland Legendary Edition, both free next week on the Epic Games Store.


Fallout 3 likely needs no introduction, given its lofty place in the gaming pantheon. Released back in 2008, it was Bethesda&#x27;s first foray into the Fallout universe (1 and 2 were the work of Black Isle Studios), expanding on the open-world RPG freedom of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion to deliver a sprawling, dizzyingly rich post-apocalyptic jaunt through The Capital Wasteland.


An &quot;embarrassment of riches&quot; is what Eurogamer called Fallout 3 in 2008, describing it as a &quot;thrilling, all-consuming experience that will absorb you for weeks... as you fall in love with the relentless excitement, incredible atmosphere, sense of place and sheer choice.&quot; The Game of the Year Edition being given away on Epic includes the base game and all its DLC.

                              <span>Developer Insomniac Games&#x27; formerly PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be coming to PC on 18th November - and ahead of its release, Sony has detailed the PC port&#x27;s system-specific features and requirements.


In case it somehow wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the Miles-Morales-starring follow-up to Insomniac&#x27;s original Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, taking the first game&#x27;s acclaimed web-swinging open-world action and infusing it with a new hero and a bit of snowy, seasonal jollity thanks to its year-end setting.


&quot;Insomniac&#x27;s second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original,&quot; said Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robinson in his Recommended review, &quot;but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too.&quot;

                              <span>The growing popularity of digital purchases has had the unintended effect of breaking down regional pricing barriers designed to keep games affordable all over the world. 


This is due to &quot;region-hopping&quot; - a tactic used by those seeking to take advantage of lower prices in other countries, as publishers adjust the price of games in each region based on median incomes. 


The trouble with this is it means customers from richer economies can also loophole themselves into grabbing a game for significantly cheaper than their own local pricing.

The service launched back in February 2021 for games to be validated against the Xbox accessibility guidelines and accessibility tags applied. Now, developers can gain feedback from disabled players testing their games.


Microsoft announced this news at today&#x27;s Xbox Accessibility Showcase, celebrating the disability community and those making gaming more accessible.

This agreement with the US National Labor Relations Board concludes Clifton&#x27;s long-running dispute with Nintendo and its contractor agency Aston Carter, through which they were employed to test Nintendo games. 


As part of the deal, Nintendo must also display a notice informing employees (in block capital letters) they &quot;WILL NOT&quot; be fired or stopped from discussing unionisation.

                              <span>Bart and Milhouse often have a rough time of it throughout The Simpsons&#x27; many episodes and seasons. The duo can regularily be seen getting into all sorts of exploits that often result in them losing girls, getting wedgies and a myriad of other such fiascos. Remember that time Bart sold his soul to Milhouse? That was certainly an unfortunate time for the spikey-haired skateboarder. 
However, one of the most disappointing moments for Milhouse came in an episode known as &quot;The Springfield Files.&quot;

This episode, a crossover with the X-Files, focuses primarily on Homer&#x27;s conviction he has seen an alien - something that, of course, Agents Mulder and Scully immediately hot-foot it to Springfield to sort out. But that is not what we are here to talk about. Rather, I want to remind you all of the arcade game Milhouse plays in this episode - Kevin Costner&#x27;s Waterworld.

Walther is widely known for their detailed and excellent Bloodborne PSX demake, and has been working on the racing project since March.

Their latest update shows off Gehrman, the elderly gentleman who hangs around the workshop inside the Hunter&#x27;s Dream, though I suspect he&#x27;s been modding his ride a bit.

                              <span>Picture this. You just finished up a session of Overwatch 2 with the squad, and now it&#x27;s time to chill with some Netflix. 


Sure, you could use the built-in app on your Smart TV, or switchover to your Chromecast, but that&#x27;s a lot of effort. 


Both Sony and Microsoft have been kind enough to include all your favorite media apps, including a native Disney+ app on PS5 at last!

The game was set for release on 4th November across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S - including day one via Xbox Game Pass - but has met &quot;some unique challenges&quot;.


&quot;We apologise for the inconvenience but rest assured that Sega Europe, Amplitude Studios and Aspyr are working hard to bring the best possible Humankind experience to console players. We can&#x27;t give a timeframe on a new release date right now, but as soon as we are in a position to do so, we will let everyone know and we thank the community for their continued support and understanding,&quot; reads a press release.

The Rock, of course, already exists in Fortnite as one of the game&#x27;s original characters - The Foundation - and has leant his role and likeness to the hero since March last year. 


Now he&#x27;ll appear in character as Black Adam, to tie in with his appearance in the film of the same name, which is set to launch in cinemas next week.

                              <span>Last month Google Stadia officially announced it will shut down its beleaguered cloud gaming service for good in January next year.


Now, in light of this news, the developer behind top-down party battle game and Google Stadia exclusive Outcasters has informed its players that, at this point in time, it &quot;does not have plans to bring [the game] to other platforms&quot;.


In a statement on Twitter, British developer Splash Damage explained that as Outcasters was both designed and built with Stadia specifically in mind, the game&#x27;s systems were &quot;heavily reliant on the platform&quot; and the work required to release it on a different platform was simply too complex at this time.

This latest complaint, filed in Los Angeles by a former employee of the company referred to as Jane Doe, targets both the Call of Duty maker itself and the employee&#x27;s former manager, Miguel Vega. 

Doe is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against the company and her ex-manager. In addition to this, Doe has demanded the removal of Bobby Kotick as CEO, as part of the lawsuit.

The pilot was co-funded by the Commonwealth Games Federation (GF) and the Global Esports Federation (GEF). At the time, the CGF called the pilot a success and expected esports to be held at future Games.

That means balance adjustments when playing against others online, such as increased stamina attack power and a decrease in the power of Ashes of War.


These adjustments do not affect single-player or cooperative play.

                              <span>Sony has now sold 2m units of its PlayStation 5 console in the UK, despite a recent price hike.


It took 98 weeks to reach this number, in-line with sales of the PS3 and making it the joint fourth fastest-selling console in the UK.


Since launch, the console has been hampered with stock shortage issues and remains in high demand. That&#x27;s despite a price increase for UK consumers of £30 back in August, which Sony blamed on inflation.

                              <span>Electronic Arts has accidentally allowed players a peek at FIFA 23&#x27;s World Cup mode early on PS5. 


The mode was not due to be released until later this year, ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar which begins in  November. 


FIFA 23 owners on PlayStation 5 have posted screenshots of the mode on social media, which show four different sub-modes: FIFA World Cup Live, FIFA World Cup Kick-Off, Online Tournament and FIFA World Cup 2022.

                              <span>Sony may have accidentally revealed that PlayStation classic Ridge Racer 2 is on its way to PS Plus.


Yesterday, Sony announced the next slate of games coming to the subscription service in October, including Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Dragon Quest 11, and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey.


PlayStation Access, the official PlayStation YouTube channel, included Ridge Racer 2 in its list of classic games, but this was not included in the PlayStation Blog. The PlayStation Access video has since been updated (thanks VGC).

                              <span>EA has triumphantly termed the recently-released FIFA 23 as &quot;record-breaking&quot; - for hitting 10.3 million players in its first week, and having the &quot;biggest launch period in EA Sports FIFA franchise history&quot;.


FIFA 23 is, of course, also the last EA Sports FIFA franchise release in history - with the series set to transition to EA Sports FC from next year. 


Signs were good that FIFA 23 had performed well at launch this year. Launched on 30th September, the game&#x27;s first week of UK boxed game sales slightly beat those of FIFA 22 - despite the overall trend of declining physical game sales in favour of digital.

The Rplate can reportedly function in extreme temperatures, has some customization features, and is managed via Bluetooth using a smartphone app. Rplates are also equipped with an LTE antenna, which can be used to push updates, change the plate if the vehicle is reported stolen or lost, and notify vehicle owners if their car may have been stolen.
Perhaps most importantly to the average car owner, Reviver said Rplate owners can renew their registration online through the Reviver mobile app...</span>

                              <span>With Starfield&#x27;s hugely anticipated 2023 release growing ever-closer, Bethesda has launched a new Q&amp;A video series, and episode one sees director Todd Howard responding to a number of community queries - including sharing some thoughts on traits, dialogue, and whether Starfield can be described as a &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; game.


Howard began the chat by detailing a few of Starfield&#x27;s inspirations - 1984 space sim SunDog: Frozen Legacy and pen-and-paper RPG Traveller, if you&#x27;re wondering - before moving on to tackle the &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; question. This, he said, was a little tricky to answer insofar as different people will likely have different definitions of &quot;hard sci-fi&quot;, but for Bethesda, &quot;It is more hard to us, where you can draw that line from, okay, here&#x27;s how man explored space, and [then] look at our ships and say, alright that has some visual identity back to that&quot;.


However, he also called the question a bit of a trap, &quot;because it&#x27;s a video game. Like, a hard science-fiction video game would be, you die in space cold.&quot;

                              <span>Valve has finally revamped its decidedly decrepit Steam mobile app for iOS and Android, introducing a fresh look, a new interface, and a range of new features.


The original version of Valve&#x27;s Steam mobile app launched over a decade ago, and it&#x27;s felt exceedingly outdated for a very long time. As of today, though, iOS and Android users can download a completely refreshed version via their device&#x27;s respective app stores.


It&#x27;s most immediately obvious change is a considerably more streamlined interface - which gives quick access to the store, personalised news, Steam Guard, and notifications, as well as unburying the likes of wish lists and other key features - but there&#x27;s plenty more besides.

                              <span>Torchlight: Infinite - a new free-to-play reimagining of the dungeon-crawling action-RPG series - has just launched its open beta on Android, iOS, and PC.


Torchlight, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was originally the work of now-defunct developer Runic Games, which made two games in the series before its closure in 2017 - the sequel delivering a critically acclaimed chunk of captivating dungeon-crawling and class-based hack-and-slash action. 


Having disbanded Runic, publisher Perfect World then revived the series just nine months later, handing the reins to developer Echtra Games for 2020&#x27;s Torchlight 3. Interestingly, this third outing was initially planned to be a free-to-play title before Perfect World eventually capitulated after a bit of an outcry - but now, following Torchlight 3&#x27;s less-than-stellar reception, those free-to-play plans are back for Torchlight: Infinite.

                              <span>FIFA has launched its first video game venture since its split with EA - a vaguely football-themed Roblox &quot;immersive experience&quot; intended to tie-in with this year&#x27;s Qatar world cup.


Following the termination of FIFA&#x27;s partnership with EA earlier this year - which will result in the latter&#x27;s long-running football series being rebranded as EA Sports FC from 2023 - FIFA president Gianni Infantino insisted, &quot;I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans.&quot;


To that end, it said it had already started engaging with publishers, studios, and investors to create a major new simulation football title for 2024, but would first be launching a number of &quot;non-simulation games&quot; toward the end of this year.

The headline addition is Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the definitive edition version previously remastered for PS4 and PS5. 


But Dragon Quest fans will be happy with five games from the series added to PS Plus: Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age, Dragon Quest Builders and its sequel, Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree&#x27;s Woe and the Blight Below, and Dragon Quest Heroes 2: Explorer&#x27;s Edition.

&quot;Let&#x27;s try that again,&quot; Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra wrote on Twitter last night, sharing a fresh blog post from the developer which apologises - yet again - for the game&#x27;s troubled arrival and offers a few bits and pieces to cheer fans up.


Overwatch 2 players can look forward to &quot;several Double Match XP weekends&quot; - dates for which will be announced soon. Anyone who logs in this season from 25th October onwards will also get a Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary skin and a Health Pack Weapon Charm, which is nice I guess.

Custom boot videos for the Steam Deck have recently taken off, and Reddit user waylaidwanderer has even gone to the lengths of setting up the website SteamDeckRepo, dedicated to sharing videos for others to use.

Now it looks like Valve is jumping onto the trend, with references to &quot;Steam Deck Startup Movies&quot; found in code for the Points Shop.
