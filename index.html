                <p>Returnal, as you won't need telling if you've been  braving its trials this week, isn't an easy game. But it turns out a little bit of help (albeit not of the entirely above-board kind) has been left lingering within the game in the form of some newly discovered debug cheat codes - just don't expect them to stick around for very much longer.
As discovered by YouTuber TheRandomizer - and elaborated upon elsewhere - players can slightly ease their progress through Housemarque's tough-as-nails sci-fi shooter b…</p>

                <p>At least half a dozen more Google Stadia staff have found a new home at Haven Studios, the developer set up by former Stadia games exec Jade Raymond. 
The list notably includes Corey May, who like Raymond once helped define the early Assassin's Creed series. May served as scriptwriter, lead writer and then narrative director on numerous Assassin's Creed games over the course of a 12-year span, and worked with Raymond on the series' first couple of entries.

                <p>Total War: Warhammer 3 gameplay details and images have leaked online ahead of the game's big reveal.
The hotly-anticipated strategy game's official gameplay reveal is set for 5pm on 13th May, but someone posted screenshots and details to 4chan - before they were deleted.
That didn't stop redditor Hollownerox from compiling the information, and for the images to make their way to reddit.

Gamescom will now be online and free for all, the German Games Industry Association announced.

                <p>Resident Evil Village isn't out yet, but its mod scene has already kicked off.
NexusMods' Village page is filling up quick with eye-catching mods for Village's ongoing demo, and, yes, the one I'm going to pull out is about Lady Dimitrescu.
The Count Theodora mod, created by Crazy Potato, replaces Lady Dimitrescu's head with Thomas the Tank Engine. It is as nightmarish as it sounds. Check out Crazy Potato's video, below, to see it in action:

                <p>Blizzard has lost another two million players across its titles.
Reporting its latest financial results, Activision Blizzard said Blizzard specifically saw 27m monthly active users in the first quarter of 2021.
As MassivelyOP points out, that's down from the 29m MAUs Blizzard had in the previous quarter. In fact, Blizzard has lost almost 29 percent of its overall active player base in three years.

The exchange is one of several revealing, private emails sent between company top brass made public as part of the ongoing Apple vs Epic Games trial. 
Last August, Sweeney emailed Spencer to suggest Microsoft drop the F2P Xbox Live Gold firewall and time it alongside Fortnite's Marvel season launch and permanent V-Bucks price-drop.

                <p>Apple just patched a MacOS vulnerability that bypassed malware checks.
The flaw is akin to a front entrance that&#8217;s barred and bolted effectively, but with a cat door at the bottom that you can easily toss a bomb through. Apple mistakenly assumed that applications will always have certain specific attributes. Owens discovered that if he made an application that was really just a script—code that tells another program what do rather than doing it itself—and didn&#8217;t include a standard application me…</p>

After Faïd&#8217;s helicopter breakout, 3,000 police officers took part in the manhunt. According to the 2019 documentary La Traque de Rédoine Faïd, detective units scoured records of cell phones used during his escape, isolating a handful of numbers active at the time that went silent shortly thereafter.</p>

Once you have containerized a non-parallel Job,
it is quite easy to get it up and running on Kubernetes without modifications to
the binary. In most cases, when running parallel distributed Jobs, you had
to set a separate system to partition the work among the workers. For
example, you could set up a task queue to assign one work item to each
Pod or multiple items
to each Pod until the queue is emptied.

The CSI Volume Health Monitoring feature, originally introduced in 1.19 has undergone a large update for the 1.21 release.
Why add Volume Health Monitoring to Kubernetes?
Without Volume Health Monitoring, Kubernetes has no knowledge of the state of the underlying volumes of a storage system after a PVC is provisioned and used by a Pod. Many things could happen to the underlying storage system after a volume is provisioned in Kubernetes. For example, the volume could be deleted by …</p>

Kubernetes clusters are typically used by several teams in an organization. In other cases, Kubernetes may be used to deliver applications to end users requiring segmentation and isolation of resources across users from different organizations. Secure sharing of Kubernetes control plane and worker node resources allows maximizing productivity and saving costs in both cases.

solve use-cases that require Pods to run forever, Jobs are useful when Pods need
to run to completion. Commonly used in parallel batch processing, Jobs can be

In Kubernetes v1.21, the
CronJob resource
reached general availability (GA). We've also substantially improved the
performance of CronJobs since Kubernetes v1.19, by implementing a new
controller.
In Kubernetes v1.20 we launched a revised v2 controller for CronJobs,
initially as an alpha feature. Kubernetes 1.21 uses the newer controller by
default, and the CronJob resource itself is now GA (group version: batch/v1).
