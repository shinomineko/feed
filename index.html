                <p>Resident Evil Village was once planned to feature a fan-favourite character from the series, before the story changed direction. 
This character would have popped up in disguise as a plague doctor - as you'll see in the concept art, below - before finally revealing their true identity.
(There are no spoilers for Village here, but if you'd like to play through without knowing this character doesn't appear, look away now.)

The turn-based tactics game revolves around wizards who wear modern-day tactical gear. Breaching and clearing rooms of enemies is the bulk of the gameplay, but there's an upgrade your wizards mechanic and a conspiracy plot to fuss over, too.

                <p>Fortnite's latest creation is an old-school cartoon version of Meowscles, its fan-favourite buff cat.
Toon Meowscles is obviously inspired by the early Disney, Steamboat Willie cartoon style, with the similar bouncy limbs and the now-familiar Mickey Mouse white gloves. (I asked Donlan about this and he pointed me to the work of Oswald and Mickey animator Ub Iwerks, specifically.)
Here's his cartoon debut, which will play if you log into Fortnite today:

Humble Bundle has long permitted customers to choose how they want to split their bundle payments between a charity, a game's publisher, and Humble Bundle itself, even allowing them to donate 100% of their money to charity if they so choose - a split determined by shifting a number of sliders.

                <p>The Scavengers early access is being made available to all today.
Midwinters' free-to-play third-person battle royale hybrid launched in early access form this week, but was only playable via a Twitch Drops event.
But the event ran into issues. Keys could only be claimed by watching the game on Twitch for 30 minutes, and some who tuned in did not receive their keys. Eventually, Scavengers ran out of Steam keys to give out to people, forcing Midwinter to send out Epic Games Store keys instead. Coupled with t…</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Warzone players are using the 6x6 cargo truck vehicle to great effect in what's dubbed the "Big Bertha meta".
This vehicle is pretty much a rolling fortress, and is big enough to give you significant cover across the battle royale's map. It can also tank damage for most of the match.
The Big Bertha meta is particularly popular in solos, when you're playing Warzone on your own against 149 other solo players. You can see players heading straight for a Big Bertha upon parachuting out of a chopper…</p>

                <p>Paradox has temporarily shelved Imperator: Rome to focus on other projects.
In a post on its forum titled "update of the organisation at PDS", the company outlined various internal changes made to its main development studio earlier this year.
The 150-person strong strategy studio is now split into three distinct studios: PDS Green, PDS Red, and PDS Gold. Each team is in charge of maintaining existing games and developing new games set to be announced at PDXCON, the company's upcoming showcase event.

After Faïd&#8217;s helicopter breakout, 3,000 police officers took part in the manhunt. According to the 2019 documentary La Traque de Rédoine Faïd, detective units scoured records of cell phones used during his escape, isolating a handful of numbers active at the time that went silent shortly thereafter.</p>

Graceful node shutdown, beta in 1.21, enables kubelet to gracefully evict pods during a node shutdown.
Kubernetes is a distributed system and as such we need to be prepared for inevitable failures — nodes will fail, containers might crash or be restarted, and - ideally - your workloads will be able to withstand these catastrophic events.
One of the common classes of issues are workload failures on node shutdown or …</p>

Have you ever been asked to troubleshoot a failing Kubernetes service and struggled to find basic information about the service such as the source repository and owner?
One of the problems as Kubernetes applications grow is the proliferation of services. As the number of services grows, developers start to specialize working with specific services.

Once you have containerized a non-parallel Job,
it is quite easy to get it up and running on Kubernetes without modifications to
the binary. In most cases, when running parallel distributed Jobs, you had
to set a separate system to partition the work among the workers. For
example, you could set up a task queue to assign one work item to each
Pod or multiple items
to each Pod until the queue is emptied.

The CSI Volume Health Monitoring feature, originally introduced in 1.19 has undergone a large update for the 1.21 release.
Why add Volume Health Monitoring to Kubernetes?
Without Volume Health Monitoring, Kubernetes has no knowledge of the state of the underlying volumes of a storage system after a PVC is provisioned and used by a Pod. Many things could happen to the underlying storage system after a volume is provisioned in Kubernetes. For example, the volume could be deleted by …</p>

Kubernetes clusters are typically used by several teams in an organization. In other cases, Kubernetes may be used to deliver applications to end users requiring segmentation and isolation of resources across users from different organizations. Secure sharing of Kubernetes control plane and worker node resources allows maximizing productivity and saving costs in both cases.

In Kubernetes v1.21, the
CronJob resource
reached general availability (GA). We've also substantially improved the
performance of CronJobs since Kubernetes v1.19, by implementing a new
controller.
In Kubernetes v1.20 we launched a revised v2 controller for CronJobs,
initially as an alpha feature. Kubernetes 1.21 uses the newer controller by
default, and the CronJob resource itself is now GA (group version: batch/v1).
