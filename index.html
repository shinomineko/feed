                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West, the highly anticipated follow-up to Guerrilla Games&#x27; acclaimed open-world action-adventure Horizon Zero Dawn, has reportedly been delayed into 2022.
Announced last summer, Horizon Forbidden West was originally set to launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5 toward the end of this year; however, Sony hinted a slip might be possible back it June, when it announced God of War: Ragnarok would now be a 2022 title. &quot;We think we are on track to release [Horizon Forbidden West] this holiday season,&quot; said PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst at the time, &quot;But that isn&#x27;t quite certain yet, and we&#x27;re working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can.&quot;
Hints that Sony was now leaning toward delaying Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s release into next year first surfaced yesterday, courtesy of GameBeat journalist Jeff Grubb, who suggested the company was still &quot;undecided&quot; on the matter during his Giant Bomb show. However, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier has now weighed in with the more definite statement that &quot;Sony has delayed the PlayStation exclusive... to the first quarter of 2022&quot;, according to his source.

                    <span>Developer Two Point Studios&#x27; wonderful medical management sim Two Point Hospital is getting in on Sonic&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebrations with a free selection of costumes and items for all platforms inspired by the hedgehog&#x27;s video game adventures.
The snappily titled Sonic the Hedgehog Pack is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam as part of Two Point Hospital&#x27;s latest update, bringing a total of four outfits for hospital staff to wear - based on Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles - as well as various theme-appropriate decorations. There&#x27;s a massive Sonic statue, for instance, plus the likes of Sonic rugs and posters, stylised sunflowers and palm trees, totem poles, and even a big ol&#x27; spinning gold ring.
Sonic&#x27;s Two Point Hospital intrusion comes as the management sim enjoys a variety of heavy discounts and promotional events across different platforms. There&#x27;s a free trial on Switch until 8th August for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in certain countries - as well as 30% off the game and all DLC - and it&#x27;s currently free to play for all Steam users until 2nd August. Discounts there include 75% off the base game and up to 50% off all DLC until 5th August.

                    <span>Icarus, the sci-fi survival game from DayZ creator Dean Hall, will no longer launch on 11th August as originally announced and is now expected to arrive some time this November.
Icarus (now a full-price release after developer RocketWerkz pivoted away from its initial free-to-play plans) casts players as deep-space prospectors attempting to salvage what they can from the surface of a hostile alien planet following a terraforming disaster.
&quot;Icarus was once destined to be a second Earth,&quot; explains the game&#x27;s Steam page, &quot;but when terraforming collapsed, the air turned toxic and humanity&#x27;s hopes of colonising a new world died... Yet when xeno-biologists discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these &#x27;exotics&#x27; sparked a gold rush, fuelling political tensions on Earth, and bringing prospectors flocking to Icarus.&quot;

                    <span>We&#x27;ve all been there - chests overflowing with gold, rubies on the floor, amber pearls somehow floating around in your food storage. And not a merchant in sight to help you spend it all. But the upcoming Hearth and Home update for Valheim should help with your treasure storage problems, as it&#x27;s due to add a bunch of shiny new items to help you create your own bank vault.
As explained in a blog post, the developers at Iron Gate are now returning from their summer holidays to continue work on Hearth and Home, which is the first major update for Valheim since its launch. The team are apparently still on track to deliver the update &quot;this very quarter&quot;, so we shouldn&#x27;t have to wait much longer to see all the delicious goodies arriving in the patch (like Eyescream, Shocklate Smoothies and the ominously-named &quot;wolf meats&quot;). 
This update isn&#x27;t just about food, however, and you&#x27;ll soon be able to create your very own treasure trove. Coin stacks and coin piles will be added as items that can be crafted from your excess gold. If you don&#x27;t want it all on display, you can store your bling in a special treasure chest. And if you want to secure all your earnings, you might want to craft the new iron gate.

                    <span>With the upcoming release of the Steam Deck, it looks like Valve is adding more quality of life improvements to Steam.
A new update has been released in the beta channel, bringing a new storage manager. 
The new interface features a tabbed view listing all the drives in your system, a visual representation of what types of files are taking up storage (games, DLC, and other apps), and a list of all the games in each drive.

Earlier this week streamer Mitchriz completed Sekiro&#x27;s Shura ending with a time of four hours, 35 minutes and 13 seconds, all while blindfolded. Here&#x27;s a clip of the moment he completed the run - spoilers for the final boss, obviously:
It&#x27;s worth watching the rest of the run, too, as it&#x27;s fascinating to see how Mitchriz navigates Sekiro&#x27;s world using only audio cues. (Rather conveniently, he also has an input overlay so you can see what he&#x27;s doing with his mouse and keyboard.) On sections near cliff edges, Mitchriz has to carefully count down the seconds to measure how far he&#x27;s walking in any one direction, often darting forwards to help control his movements. On some occasions Mitchriz slashes with a sword until he hits a wall, with the change in sound indicating his position. Grapple points seem to serve as useful tools for navigation, while enemy sounds and cutscenes also help telegraph his position.

                    <span>&quot;It&#x27;s exhausting, frustrating and it&#x27;s counter to the messaging they give us.&quot; That was the reaction of one Ubisoft developer to CEO Yves Guillemot&#x27;s email to staff last night.
On Wednesday, nearly 500 current and former Ubisoft employees (we understand this figure is now over 1000) across 32 studios, signed an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard staff following a recent lawsuit that called the World of Warcraft and Overwatch studio &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
The letter slammed Ubisoft leadership&#x27;s &quot;empty promises&quot; in response to allegations of &quot;systemic discrimination, harassment and bullying&quot; within the company, and proposed an industry wide collaboration to agree a set of &quot;rules and processes for handling reports of these offences&quot;.

                    <span>EA Sports has released a new trailer for FIFA 22.
It&#x27;s mostly just marketing points, but it does provide the first brief snippets of gameplay throughout that give us an idea of how the game will look on PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series consoles. 
The focal point of FIFA 22 is what EA calls HyperMotion Technology, which combines full-team mocap data and machine learning. The idea is to make player movement feel more fluid and natural. This has led to 4000 new animations in the game.

                    <span>Forza Motorsport 7 will reach &quot;End of Life status&quot; on 15th September, developer Turn 10 Studios has announced. 
That means you will no longer be able to purchase the game or its DLC from the Microsoft Store after that date, nor will it be available on Xbox Game Pass.
Existing owners will still be able to download and play the game after the date, and online services will continue to run.

                    <span>The time has come for me to find a new home for my (paper) cryptography library. It’s about 150 linear feet of books, conference proceedings, journals, and monographs — mostly from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.
My preference is that it goes to an educational institution, but will consider a corporate or personal home if that’s the only option available. If you think you can break it up and sell it, I’ll consider that as a last resort. New owner pays all packaging and shipping costs, and possibly a purchase price depending on who you are and what you want to do with the library...</span>

                    <span>New paper: “Encrypted Cloud Photo Storage Using Google Photos“:
Abstract: Cloud photo services are widely used for persistent, convenient, and often free photo storage, which is especially useful for mobile devices. As users store more and more photos in the cloud, significant privacy concerns arise because even a single compromise of a user’s credentials give attackers unfettered access to all of the user’s photos. We have created Easy Secure Photos (ESP) to enable users to protect their photos on cloud photo services such as Google Photos. ESP introduces a new client-side encryption architecture that includes a novel format-preserving image encryption algorithm, an encrypted thumbnail display mechanism, and a usable key management system. ESP encrypts image data such that the result is still a standard format image like JPEG that is compatible with cloud photo services. ESP efficiently generates and displays encrypted thumbnails for fast and easy browsing of photo galleries from trusted user devices. ESP’s key management makes it simple to authorize multiple user devices to view encrypted image content via a process similar to device pairing, but using the cloud photo service as a QR code communication channel. We have implemented ESP in a popular Android photos app for use with Google Photos and demonstrate that it is easy to use and provides encryption functionality transparently to users, maintains good interactive performance and image quality while providing strong privacy guarantees, and retains the sharing and storage benefits of Google Photos without any changes to the cloud service...</span>

With Kubernetes 1.22 due out next week, now is a great time to look back on 1.21. The release team for that version was led by Nabarun Pal from VMware.
Back in April I interviewed Nabarun on the weekly Kubernetes Podcast from Google; the latest in a series of release lead conversations that started back with 1.11, not long after the show started back in 2018.
In these interviews we learn a little about the release, but also about the process behind it, and the story behind the person chosen to lead it. Getting to know a community member is my favourite part of the show each week, and so I encourage you to subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. With a release coming next week, you can probably guess what our next topic will be!

                    <span>SkateBird, the adorable avian-themed skateboarding title from developer Glass Bottom Games, has pushed back its release by just over a month, and will now come to Xbox, Switch, PC, and Amazon Luna on 16th September.
SkateBird, which was originally due to release in August, casts players as a &quot;chill little skateboarding bird&quot; that passes the time waiting for its owner to come home from work by constructing a glorious, homemade skatepark.
In this bird-sized skateboarding paradise, players can trick and grind their way toward completing missions and unlocking courses, hopefully attracting a loyal bird following and fixing their human friend&#x27;s life along the way.

                    <span>Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine&#x27;s gorgeous sci-fi action-adventure Solar Ash finally has a release date and will be heading to PlayStation and PC on 26th October.
Announced back in 2019 under the working title Solar Ash Kingdom, Heart Machine&#x27;s latest adventure takes players to a &quot;surreal, vivid and highly stylised world filled with mystery, wild high-speed traversal, endearing characters, and massive enemy encounters&quot; as they, in the role of Voidrunner Rei, attempt to save their home planet from the Ultravoid - a massive black hole that swallows entire worlds.
In more practical terms, Solar Ash (which trades Hyper Light Drifter&#x27;s intricate top-down pixel art for a fully 3D world) is a third-person action-platformer with a focus on &quot;fluidity of movement&quot;. Players are able to quickly leap, slide, grind, and grapple across huge distances as they explore the likes of sunken cities, vast water shelves, and dangerous lava zones, battling ever-more fearsome enemies along the way.

The story of this new chapter, revealed as part of tonight&#x27;s Annapurna Interactive showcase, remains largely a mystery.

                    <span>Developer Asobo Studio&#x27;s wonderful, rat-infested medieval stealth adventure A Plague Tale: Innocence will be free on the Epic Games Store starting next Thursday, 5th August.
A Plague Tale unfolds in a bleak, but gorgeously wrought, version of 14th century France, and follows the harrowing journey of Amicia and her sickly 5-year-old brother Hugo, the children of a nobleman, after they&#x27;re forced to flee their home in an attempt to escape the Inquisition.
What follows is a brilliantly engaging single-player adventure - primarily built around simple stealth and dual-character puzzling - that sees players evading ravenous rat hordes, English soldiers, and other perils as they traipse across the desolate, plague-ridden landscape.

Black Panther is the third new playable hero to be added to the game since its launch last year, and follows the arrival of two distinct Hawkeye incarnations in the form of Kate Bishop and Clint Barton. Just like his predecessors, Black Panther is a free addition to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers and will be accompanied by his own story campaign.
War for Wakanda, as the campaign is known, focusses on current Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda, King T&#x27;Challa. &quot;Blindsided by a betrayal and the resulting tragedy,&quot; teases Square Enix, &quot;T&#x27;Challa finds it difficult to entrust his duty to anyone else, even his sister Shuri... When arch-villain Klaw&#x27;s forces threaten Wakanda&#x27;s safety, T&#x27;Challa must take the fight right to them to defend everything and everyone he holds dear.&quot;

Last week&#x27;s story quest saw players aiding the anthropomorphic tree in a series of missions to raise an alien hatchling and restore peace with the invaders - all part of the game&#x27;s current UFO season storyline. 
The quest appeared to end in success - until today, when Bushranger is no longer available to find on the game&#x27;s island map as an NPC, and instead there&#x27;s a small grave marked in his usual spot with some flowers.

                    <span>Destruction AllStars has received a new patch that makes a number of significant changes to the game. 
The key change has been fixing so-called &quot;ghost hits&quot;, where players feel like they lose vehicle health for no apparent reason. This tends to happen when other players are close by but appear to not make contact. 
Developer Lucid Games believes this is caused by latency issues, and has &quot;worked on a new set of parameters between the game and the servers which should help keep everyone in sync a bit better than it had previously&quot;.

The update also adds a number of useful software features, and try a version of 3D Audio for any built-in TV speaker. According to Sony, players can measure the acoustics of their room using the DualSense microphone and choose a setting best suited to their surroundings. 
Meanwhile, changes to the PS5 software itself mean beta testers will now be able to see the PS4 and PS5 versions of the same game separately on the Home screen and Game Library, with a game&#x27;s tile labelled as the appropriate platform.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not every day a mod wins a national writing award, but the quality of the story in Skyrim mod The Forgotten City was enough to see it pick up an Australian Writers&#x27; Guild Award back in 2016. The mod was downloaded over 3m times, and it&#x27;s now taken on a new form, as the mod has been transformed into a standalone game. 
The Forgotten City released yesterday on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It&#x27;s been updated with professional voice acting, new gameplay mechanics, a new orchestral score and a significant overhaul of the original script. &quot;If you liked the mod, you&#x27;re going to love the standalone game,&quot; says the Steam description. &quot;We&#x27;ve taken the best elements of the mod, re-written the script, which is now more than twice the length of the original at 80k+ words, and added plenty of exciting new twists, endings, and surprises.&quot;
In terms of gameplay, The Forgotten City is a murder mystery game set in a cursed Roman city where &quot;if one person sins, everyone dies&quot;. Players must explore, question characters and exploit a time loop in order to solve the mystery. Combat is an option, but apparently this will only get you so far. There are moral dilemmas, multiple endings and opportunities to roleplay - all in a city filled with historically authentic Roman &quot;art, architecture, costumes and customs&quot;.

                    <span>Former World of Warcraft senior creative director Alex Afrasiabi was fired last summer following an internal investigation, Activision Blizzard has now said. 
Afrasiabi&#x27;s departure had been known, though the details surrounding it - including new and disturbing details of a 2013 BlizzCon hotel room nicknamed the &quot;Cosby suite&quot; - have only now been publicly confirmed following a Kotaku report. 
In a statement issued to Kotaku last night, an Activision Blizzard spokesperson revealed an internal investigation into the &quot;Cosby Suite&quot; had taken place in June 2020, following a separate investigation of Afrasiabi. As a result, Afrasiabi was &quot;terminated... for his misconduct in his treatment of other employees&quot;.

                    <span>A teenager on an airplane sent a photo of a replica gun via AirDrop to everyone who had their settings configured to receive unsolicited photos from strangers. This caused a three-hour delay as the plane — still at the gate — was evacuated and searched.
The teen was not allowed to reboard. I can’t find any information about whether he was charged with any of those vague “terrorist threat” crimes.
It’s been a long time since we’ve had one of these sorts of overreactions.</span>

                    <span>Nearly 500 current and former Ubisoft employees have signed an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard staff following a recent lawsuit that called the World of Warcraft and Overwatch studio &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;. The letter also slams Ubisoft leadership&#x27;s &quot;empty promises&quot; in response to allegations of &quot;systemic discrimination, harassment and bullying&quot; within the company, and proposes an industry wide collaboration to agree a set of &quot;rules and processes for handling reports of these offences&quot;.
Addressing Activision Blizzard staff, the open letter, shared by Axios reporter Stephen Totilo on Twitter, begins, &quot;We hear you and want to loudly declare our solidarity with you. Over the past week, the games industry has once again been rocked by revelations that have long been known by too many of us. Revelations that a year ago many were hearing about Ubisoft.&quot;
&quot;It is clear, from the frequency of these reports,&quot; the letter continues, &quot;that there is a widespread and deeply ingrained culture of abusive behaviours within the industry. It should no longer be a surprise to anyone: employees, executives, journalists, or fans that these heinous acts are going on. It is time to stop being shocked. We must demand real steps be taken to prevent them. Those responsible must be held accountable for their actions.&quot;

                    <span>Organisers of today&#x27;s staff walkout at Activision Blizzard are pressing ahead with the protest, saying the statement released by company boss Bobby Kotick overnight &quot;fails to address critical elements at the heart of the employee concerns&quot;.
Activision Blizzard employees announced strike action last night, in protest against the company&#x27;s response to a recent lawsuit from California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing which alleged a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
Activision immediately went on the defensive, calling the lawsuit &quot;irresponsible behaviour from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State&#x27;s best businesses out of California&quot;. Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend later doubled down on the attack in an email to all employees, calling the lawsuit &quot;truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit&quot;.

                    <span>The Tokyo 2020 Olympic opening ceremony featured a suite of video game music - including tracks from Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts and Sonic the Hedgehog - but one publisher was notably missing from the lineup. Where was Nintendo? According to leaked documents, it seems that there were once plans for the publisher to be more involved with the opening ceremony, with Nintendo songs included in the soundtrack and various Mario-themed shenanigans. 
The news comes via Japanese media outlet Shukan Bunshun, which has obtained several documents for the opening ceremony ranging from April 2020 to July this year. According to these plans, the event would have featured performances inspired by the &quot;8-bit world of video games&quot; including Super Mario and Space Invaders, overseen by Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto. 
One composition plan dated 4th October 2020 featured a proposal that would have seen the return of the warp pipes from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics closing ceremony... with something of a twist. One graphic shows Lady Gaga entering a pipe, only to re-emerge as comedian Naomi Watanabe (sporting a blonde wig and red cap).

                    <span>Microsoft has announced August&#x27;s Xbox Games with Gold lineup, which includes colourful platformer Yooka-Laylee and the... slightly less colourful Darksiders 3.
Darksiders 3 will become available for Games with Gold subscribers to claim from 1st to 31st August. Yooka-Laylee will then be available from 16th August to 15th September. 
&quot;Playtonic&#x27;s tribute to Banjo is a gentle, irreverent platformer let down by spotty handling and a slight shortage of genius,&quot; Edwin wrote of Yooka-Laylee in Eurogamer&#x27;s review.

                    <span>Picross is already amazing, but what could make an amazing thing even amazing-ier? I&#x27;ll tell you what: giving it all a big &#x27;ol Master System and Mega Drive themed makeover and then hurling the whole nostalgia-tweaking package onto Switch next week, on 5th August.
Picross S Mega Drive &amp; Master System Edition (known as Picross S Genesis &amp; Master System Edition in the US for obvious reasons) is an official collaboration between Sega and developer Jupiter, the team behind the long-running, and consistently brilliant, puzzle series.
Once again, the meat of the game involves filling in little squares on a grid - using the numerical clues above and beside each column and row for pointers - until you&#x27;ve successfully managed to create a picture. This time, though, players are working toward creating final images that conjure characters from a total of 59 classic Sega games (and to musical accompaniment from each), some of which are revealed in the announcement trailer below.

                    <span>A new studio has been formed by veterans from the Santa Monica dev scene, taking in talent from Infinity Ward,, Naughty Dog and Sony Santa Monica, with a $100 million investment from South Korean publisher Smilegate helping them make an all-new single player AAA adventure. 
That&#x27;s No Moon&#x27;s new project will see Taylor Kurosaki - formerly narrative design lead at Naughty Dog and studio narrative director at Infinity Ward - as creative director, with The Last of Us&#x27; lead game designer Jacob Minkoff working as game director. 
Offices will be split between San Diego and Los Angeles, with talent from Bungie and EA also on board. Don&#x27;t expect to see what the team&#x27;s working on anytime soon, though - the announcement comes as part of a recruitment drive, with That&#x27;s No Moon looking to ramp up to 100 staff in 2022.

                    <span>Now&#x27;s the time for trumpeting console sales figures, and Xbox has a marketing statistic of its own to flex. 
Speaking last night in a company earnings call, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said Xbox Series X/S were the company&#x27;s &quot;fastest-selling consoles ever, with more consoles sold life-to-date than any previous generation&quot;.
But Microsoft again refrained from sharing its actual sales figures - something the company hasn&#x27;t made public now for many years.

                    <span>The next instalment of Hitman 3&#x27;s Seven Deadly Sins expansion has been released.
Central to the update is a brand new Escalation contract set in the Berlin nightclub map. The Lust Assignation Escalation tasks Agent 47 with collecting intel on a secret admirer. Collect the clues and observe everyone on the dancefloor to identify the secret admirer and the Pretenders. Each time you start the contract, the admirer will be randomly selected to make each playthrough different and put all of your sleuthing skills to the test.
Completing the contract rewards you with three rewards. First, the Scarlet Suit, a red snakeskin suit complemented by matching driving gloves and sunglasses. Second, the Serpent&#x27;s Bite, a remotely detonated explosive that looks like a snake. Third, the Serpent&#x27;s Tongue, a unique crossbow loaded with blinding darts.

It remains the fastest-selling PlayStation ever.

                    <span>Last month PUBG was given a major update with the introduction of new map Taego and a Gulag-style second chance system, but there are yet more surprises in store - with multi-care packages, a secret room and... burning planes... all being added in the latest update. 
The patch notes for update 13.1 for PC are now live, and detail changes for both Taego and the wider game. Possibly the most dramatic addition is a feature called the &quot;emergency landing plane&quot;, which will definitely keep players on their toes at the start of a match. Instead of the usual calm flight above the battlegrounds, this plane starts hurtling towards the ground - while on fire - and any players who remain on board until the end of the journey will take 50 percent damage. It travels faster than the normal plane, and has a varied fall height, so you&#x27;ll need to jump at the start of the journey if you want to glide further across the map. 
&quot;Stay alert and pay attention to the flight crew&#x27;s instructions, as not every flight is an easy one,&quot; the patch notes say. You don&#x27;t have to tell me twice.

The top-down sci-fi action game, which has been described as a cross between Grand Theft Auto 2 and Cyberpunk, launches then with the city of New Baltia playable.
This provides around eight hours of play at launch, developer Dark Lord said, with more to come.

                    <span>The UK is a weird place, London most of all. For example, Westminster City Council spent £2m commissioning a new hill (no, I&#x27;m serious) near Marble Arch that opened on Monday. 
For the low price of £8, people with too much money to spend can climb the 25-metre-tall structure to have a prime view of, err, Oxford Street and Hyde Park, I guess. 
However, this waste of taxpayer money might just be a money-maker as a Mario-themed attraction. As Nintendo Life points out, people have been comparing the hill for its uncanny resemblance to Super Mario 64&#x27;s Bob-Omb Battlefield. Others have compared it to Minecraft or a PlayStation One game.

The mobile match-3 puzzler launched in July 2019 and has been kept well updated with new stages and characters. But in-game purchases have now been switched off, and the game will become completely unplayable from 1st November.
After that date, Nintendo says it will memorialise the game and your play history via &quot;Dr. Mario World Memories&quot;, a web page it will put up after pulling the game down.

Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill was general secretary of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), effectively the highest-ranking priest in the US who is not a bishop, before records of Grindr usage obtained from data brokers was correlated with his apartment, place of work, vacation home, family members’ addresses, and more.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard employees are planning a walkout tomorrow, 28th July, in protest against the company&#x27;s response to a recent lawsuit from California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
Activision was quick to slam the lawsuit, strongly denying its claims and dismissing it as &quot;irresponsible behaviour from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State&#x27;s best businesses out of California&quot;.
That was a stance repeated in an email reportedly disseminated by Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend, who insisted the lawsuit &quot;presented a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old, and out of context stories&quot;. Townshead continued, &quot;Rest assured that leadership is committed to continuing to maintain a safe, fair, and inclusive workplace. We cannot let egregious actions of others, and a truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit, damage our culture of respect and equal opportunity for all employees.&quot;

&quot;As more people started using Quest 2,&quot; Facebook explained in its recall notice on the Oculus website, &quot;we received reports that a very small percentage of Quest 2 customers were experiencing skin irritation after using the Quest 2 removable foam facial interface. We&#x27;ve been working hard to address the issue, working with experts and making adjustments to our manufacturing process, and communicating proactively with regulators.&quot;
Facebook initially announced it was investigating reports of skin irritation from Quest 2 last December, and provided an update on its findings back in April.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Rise continues its schedule of crossover updates on Switch this Friday, 30th July, as Amaterasu, star of Capcom&#x27;s beloved action-adventure classic Okami, joins the game.
More specifically, Monster Hunter Rise players will be able to acquire Amaterasu in the form of a unlockable layered armour set for their Palamute, and there&#x27;s a little more to the outfit than a mere skin swap. With the Amaterasu armour equipped, Palamutes won&#x27;t just resemble the beloved Okami character, they&#x27;ll bound across the landscape leaving a trail of blooming flowers and leaves in their wake, as is befitting of a Sun Goddess.
As yet, Capcom hasn&#x27;t specified what, exactly, players will need to go up against to obtain the new layered armour set, but expect a similar format to June&#x27;s collaboration (which added a Palico skin themed around Monster Hunter Stories 2&#x27;s Felyne Tsukino), meaning players will need to farm materials from a new event quest included as part of the update.

End of Dragons is the third expansion for the long-running fantasy MMORPG. The new trailer is below:
End of Dragons is set on the lost land of Cantha, a &quot;multi-ethnic land of magic that is home to the oldest nation of humans in all of Tyria&quot;, ArenaNet said. This area was first seen in 2006&#x27;s Guild Wars Factions, but has been closed off in Guild Wars 2.

                    <span>Developer Draknek &amp; Friends&#x27; acclaimed puzzler A Monster&#x27;s Expedition is heading to Switch next Thursday, 5th August, and a &quot;major&quot; free expansion comes to all platforms the same day.
A Monster&#x27;s Expedition initially launched for Steam and Apple Arcade at the tail-end of last year, sending players on a wonderfully relaxing open-world puzzle adventure - in the role of the titular monster - that predominantly involves rolling logs around small, awkwardly shaped landmasses, Sokoban-style, to form bridges and access new islands.
A few more wrinkles are added along the way, of course, often leading to some ingenious head scratchers, but A Monster&#x27;s Expedition has such a natural charm, it never frustrates. &quot;There&#x27;s no tension, no forced direction,&quot; wrote Chris Tapsell in his Essential review last year, &quot;just curiosity and momentum and a reward that feels, at times, like a welcome embrace.&quot;

                    <span>A Bloodborne modder has finally restored the shortcut door behind the Cleric Beast, which connects Central Yharnam to the Cathedral Ward. 
For some context, one of the biggest mysteries of Bloodborne is a locked door hidden behind the Cleric Beast, the first boss you are likely to encounter. But the door is inaccessible in the final version of the game: it&#x27;s just a static door asset.
However, in the alpha demo build, it&#x27;s possible to interact with the door from the inside. The infamous Bloodborne modder Lance McDonald showed that the door was meant to lead to a pathway which served as a shortcut between Central Yharnam and the Cathedral Ward.

                    <span>Creative Assembly has announced the Mythos expansion for A Total War Saga: Troy as the game nears its Steam launch.
The strategy game came out last year as an Epic Games Store exclusive for 12 months. It was free at launch - a move that saw 7.5 million players claim a download in just 24 hours.
Back in June 2020, Creative Assembly said this exclusivity and the free giveaway was a one-off deal for Troy, and there were no plans for future games to be Epic exclusives. The deal was about reaching a new audience, which clearly worked out.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve already heard a little about new Apex Legend Seer&#x27;s abilities, but some existing characters are also getting a rejig in upcoming season Emergence, with both Caustic and Fuse due to get some buffs. 
As explained by Gamespot, Caustic&#x27;s gas will no longer deal a flat five ticks of damage per second. Instead, it will increase in damage every other second: for instance, causing 5,5,6,6,7,7 points of damage, with no limit on how much it can increase. Balancing this out, however, the gas cloud created by Caustic&#x27;s Nox Gas Grenade will disappear five seconds faster. 
Fuse is getting some even more significant (and much-needed) improvements, with his Knuckle Cluster lasting twice as long, and his Motherlode ability now highlighting enemies. Any enemy caught in the blast will be highlighted, even if they are hidden behind a building or wall.

                    <span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons will receive further free content later this year, Nintendo has said, thanking fans for their patience during a particularly dry spell for updates.
There are no details on how big these updates may be or what features they may contain. There is no word of Brewster. But, I suppose, it is something. 
A small update arrives this Thursday, 29th July, meanwhile. This adds another smattering of seasonal items and brings back the game&#x27;s previous August fireworks.

The open letter, first reported by Bloomberg (paywall), hits out at the company&#x27;s response to the lawsuit filed last week by California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which alleges multiple female employees were subjected to gender discrimination, sexual harassment and unequal pay.
According to CNN, this letter now has over 2000 signatories - a number that is expected to grow in the coming days.

                    <span>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 has received a PlayStation 5 performance and visual update.
The upgrade for Fatshark&#x27;s melee co-op game includes a boosted framerate of 60fps at 1440p resolution, improved shadow quality and casting, higher density scattering, and screen space reflections.
A similar update to the game was released on Xbox Series X and S earlier this year.

What do we expect to happen? Well, leaks and Epic&#x27;s own legal documentation have pegged an Ariana Grande concert as coming soon - though the current state of the island suggests this will somehow be wrapped into its current alien theme.

Shared in a blog post on Xbox Wire, the screenshots (and brief video clips) provide a nice look at Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s 11 &quot;distinct and unique biomes&quot;. Seasons will return with Forza Horizon 5, and each of these 11 biomes will transition through the seasons differently: spring will bring the rainy season to the farmland and jungles, for instance, while summer might bring tropical storms to the coast. All on a map that&#x27;s about one-and-a-half times the size of Forza Horizon 4. 
&quot;We knew from the beginning that we wanted this to be the biggest Forza Horizon yet. However, if we wanted to be the biggest, then we felt we also needed to offer the most diversity and contrast as well,&quot; said creative director Mike Brown.

                    <span>The makers of a 14-year-old Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas mod have pulled it offline themselves over a fear of a takedown from Take-Two.
GTA United is a mod based on San Andreas for PC. It unites the maps of Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto Vice City in one game area within San Andreas, effectively replacing San Andreas&#x27; map.
Work on the free, non-commercial mod began in 2006. The first beta of what was then known as &quot;Vice City 2 San Andreas&quot; came out in early 2007. The beta for &quot;Liberty City 2 San Andreas&quot; came out soon after. Then, in late 2007, the beta for a combined effort called GTA United was released. Five years later, in December 2012, GTA United 1.2 was released. It remained available ever since - until now.

The game&#x27;s anti-cheat system appears to have incorrectly flagged numerous player accounts for using &quot;third-party applications&quot; - AKA cheating software.
Last night, after Eurogamer flagged the bans to Niantic, the developer acknowledged the problem and said it would now work to restore any affected player accounts.

That&#x27;s according to Variety, which reports Joe Henderson, executive producer and co-showrunner for Lucifer, is writing and producing the show.
The show will apparently be similar to the Detective Pikachu movie that was released in 2019, with a mix of live-action performances and CGI creatures.

                    <span>Interesting research: “EvilModel: Hiding Malware Inside of Neural Network Models”.
Abstract: Delivering malware covertly and detection-evadingly is critical to advanced malware campaigns. In this paper, we present a method that delivers malware covertly and detection-evadingly through neural network models. Neural network models are poorly explainable and have a good generalization ability. By embedding malware into the neurons, malware can be delivered covertly with minor or even no impact on the performance of neural networks. Meanwhile, since the structure of the neural network models remains unchanged, they can pass the security scan of antivirus engines. Experiments show that 36.9MB of malware can be embedded into a 178MB-AlexNet model within 1% accuracy loss, and no suspicious are raised by antivirus engines in VirusTotal, which verifies the feasibility of this method. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks becomes a forwarding trend of malware. We hope this work could provide a referenceable scenario for the defense on neural network-assisted attacks...</span>

With all Kubernetes APIs, there is a process to creating, maintaining, and
ultimately deprecating them once they become GA. The networking.k8s.io API group is no
different. The upcoming Kubernetes 1.22 release will remove several deprecated APIs
that are relevant to networking:
the networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version of IngressClass
all beta versions of Ingress: extensions/v1beta1 and networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
On a v1.22 Kubernetes cluster, you&#x27;ll be able to access Ingress and IngressClass
objects through the stable (v1) APIs, but access via their beta APIs won&#x27;t be possible.
This change has been in
in discussion since
2017,
2019 with
1.16 Kubernetes API deprecations, and most recently in
KEP-1453:
Graduate Ingress API to GA.

                    <span>A Last of Us Part 2 fan has pieced together unused dialogue between Ellie and Joel where they discuss her tattoo. 
Reddit user taegukie theorises that this conversation was meant to happen in the &quot;Finding Strings&quot; flashback, where Joel talks about the Savage Starlight comic he&#x27;s been reading. 
Here&#x27;s the full transcript: Joel: &quot;So I noticed that her, uh, hologram... Map thing... It&#x27;s a moth. Was that where your tattoo came from?&quot; Ellie: &quot;Ugh... Maybe?... Judgy.&quot; Joel: &quot;I ain&#x27;t judging. Just Curious.&quot; Ellie: &quot;Liar!&quot; Joel: &quot;Well, like I said, I ain&#x27;t judging... I think the moth is pretty.&quot;

                    <span>It looks like former Stadia exclusive Submerged: Hidden Depths is coming to PC, according to a Steam page that has now popped up for the game. 
Submerged: Hidden Depths, a &quot;relaxploration adventure&quot; by Uppercut Games, was originally released on Stadia in December last year. It&#x27;s now set to make the leap over to PC, although there&#x27;s currently no release date listed on Steam. 
As you can see in the trailer above, Submerged: Hidden Depths is a &quot;non-combat third-person&quot; game set in the ruins of a sunken world. Players can sail across the ocean between ruined buildings, and climb these structures to uncover hidden relics.

The gory fighting game hit 8m copies sold in October.
To put the 12m sales figure into context, Mortal Kombat X, which came out in April 2015, was in April 2019 NetherRealm&#x27;s best-selling game with almost 11m copies sold.

Square Enix has in the past prioritised Japanese for the Final Fantasy games, then dubbed them into other languages.
Speaking in a recent Japanese internet show called Washanaga (translated by Siliconera), Yoshida said the development team at Square Enix chose voice actors with English accents to play the game&#x27;s characters, and that Japanese film production will start soon.

                    <span>On 13th July, Red Dead Online received an update called Blood Money that added a number of features to the game (such as new clothing, passes and missions), but it seemingly changed something rather unexpected under the hood. The game&#x27;s horses have been acting a little strange, and in some cases, are now causing terrible accidents by colliding with players. Perhaps this is all an unofficial sequel to Spirit.  
As spotted by Kotaku, players have taken to social media to discuss the strange horse behaviour and share footage of the bugs. There are seemingly just a lot of player horses roaming through Red Dead Online, with players speculating that the horses are being left behind once players leave the lobby. Others suspect that the culprit could be a horse-cloning bug that occurs when the player enters a stable. There have even been reports of players finding AI clones of their own characters. 
In any case, the abundance of horses is causing mayhem, with players colliding with the rogue horses and being sent flying from their own saddles. Rather more tragically, some of the player horses are simply being found dead.

Thankfully, he&#x27;s not facing forwards.

Once you purchase and set up an auto shop that&#x27;s now available in the update, you&#x27;ll have access to a number of contracts. In the Prison Contract, pick the Access Point mission, where you&#x27;ll be tasked with stealing a stunt ramp for a film set.

Death Stranding launched first on PlayStation 4 in November 2019, then came to PC in July last year. It hits PlayStation 5 in Director&#x27;s Cut form (although Hideo Kojima himself isn&#x27;t thrilled with it being called a Director&#x27;s Cut) in September.

                    <span>A new update for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will add a level scaling option to the game for the first time. 
The feature arrives as part of tomorrow&#x27;s upcoming Valhalla patch, and lets you override the game&#x27;s difficulty settings for different territories. 
As it stands, Valhalla offers a range of territories set to difficulties tied to your gear level. You&#x27;ll want better gear equipped before venturing too far into its world, though players who have completed the game have said it now lacks challenge as they continue to play.

                    <span>It looks like Amazon may finally have a hit on its hands - New World hit the 200,000 concurrent players mark over the weekend.
The MMO hit a peak concurrents figure of 200,856 on Steam yesterday, making it the sixth most popular game on Valve&#x27;s platform, ahead of the likes of Rust, Warframe, Rainbow Six Siege and Football Manager 2021.
New World is currently in closed beta, with a release date proper set for 31st August.

                    <span>Ransomware isn’t new; the idea dates back to 1986 with the “Brain” computer virus. Now, it’s become the criminal business model of the internet for two reasons. The first is the realization that no one values data more than its original owner, and it makes more sense to ransom it back to them — sometimes with the added extortion of threatening to make it public — than it does to sell it to anyone else. The second is a safe way of collecting ransoms: bitcoin.
This is where the suggestion to ban cryptocurrencies as a way to “solve” ransomware comes from. Lee Reiners, executive director of the Global Financial Markets Center at Duke Law, ...</span>

                    <span>Destiny 2 developer Bungie is making changes to its transmog system.
After &quot;monitoring [players&#x27;] reception and behaviour&quot; concerning the sci-fi shooter&#x27;s divisive and time-consuming transmog system, Bungie says that from Season 15, one of the currencies used to purchase transmog bounties from Ada-1, Synthstrand, will be deprecated. Instead, you&#x27;ll be able to purchase Ada&#x27;s bounties for 10,000 Glimmer.
&quot;Since the launch of Season of the Splicer we have been monitoring reception and behaviour around our new Armor Synthesis system,&quot; the studio said in its weekly blog update. &quot;Today we&#x27;d like to review a minor update around the system&#x27;s currencies.

Though not yet formally announced by developer miHoYo, the news comes via trusted Twitter account Genshin Report, and though we don&#x27;t know much about the new fishing mechanic - nor how Watasumi will come into play - they did also share renders of three characters already announced to be joining the roster, too: Ball, Kokomi, and Sara.
Genshin Report also teased what they believe to be a new boss called La Signora, including a sneaky, and blurry, screenshot of her in action. Take a look below:

                    <span>Sony has once again renewed the trademark for its PS3-era social space, PlayStation Home.
The filing - which was reportedly submitted on 21st July 2021, according to a Redditor who&#x27;s keeping a close eye on the situation - has secured the European trademark up until 1st October 2028. Though little else is available on the trademark application&#x27;s webpage, it&#x27;s still logged as &quot;goods and services&quot;, and categorised as &quot;computer game software&quot;.
Though there&#x27;s presently no official confirmation either way that Sony might be looking to relaunch Home - or at least some kind of version of it - it&#x27;s the third such rumour to have surfaced in as many months, leading some to think it may have something to do with &quot;a return to PSVR 2&quot; (thanks, Comic Book) that would dovetail nicely into large-scale social events, such as those we&#x27;ve seen in Fortnite. Add in VR compatibility, and it could be a very exciting development indeed.

                    <span>Motive&#x27;s Dead Space remake will reportedly include content that had been cut from the original game.
According to an IGN interview with creative director Roman Campos-Oriola, original developer Visceral Games was seemingly forced to make changes to the game&#x27;s initial plans due to &quot;technical constraints&quot;. 
Now, however, the Motive team will be using the &quot;original level design&quot;, which may give us a peek at the studio&#x27;s early plans that changed during development.

Though not officially confirmed by developer/publisher Ubisoft, the second DLC instalment seemingly popped up on an Italian Windows store and was promptly screen-capped before the announcement was removed again.
While all we can do is chalk this up as an unsubstantiated rumour for now, the screencap - shared via CriptAssassINI (thanks, NME) - certainly looks convincing.

Though some prospective Steam Deckers were concerned at the use of the word &quot;targeting&quot;, Valve&#x27;s Pierre-Loup Griffais took to Twitter to emphasise that the hardware wasn&#x27;t targeting 30 FPS as much as it was suggesting 30 FPS is the minimum Steam Deck users can expect.
All the games that have been tested on Steam Deck thus far have reportedly &quot;consistently met and exceeded&quot; 30 FPS, plus there&#x27;ll also be an optional FPS limiter to enable players to choose between framerates and prolonging the mobile device&#x27;s battery life.

                    <span>Back in the 1990s, Iraqi programmer and designer Auday Hussein worked on an Amiga adaptation of the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest surviving work of literature. He was kind enough to talk me through this amazing project earlier this year, discussing his first experiments with the MSX and Amiga, what it was like learning about programming in Baghdad during the rule of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, the challenges of visualising the Gilgamesh universe, and the possibility of releasing the partly completed game today.
Hussein also shared a video of the game, which now has the working title &quot;Kingdom of Death&quot;. It&#x27;s a beautiful and atmospheric action-adventure set in the underworld, with a wonderful monster bestiary and thoughtful puzzles tied to cuneiform inscriptions. You can read much more in the full feature, but here&#x27;s the video by itself if you&#x27;d rather cut to the chase.
An excerpt from the article, for context: &quot;It&#x27;s a 2D platform adventure with a musclebound, sword-wielding hero, a vast menagerie of monsters and intricate, cavernous environments. It takes inspiration from a multitude of non-Mesopotamian sources, including Shadow of the Beast, Zelda and David Joiner&#x27;s 1987 RPG Fairy Tale Adventure, and is &quot;more free, more open&quot; than the Gilgamesh narrative, with puzzles that pull you deeper into the setting.&quot;

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s first bot-focused technical preview could happen as soon as next weekend, 343 has announced.
This first &quot;technical preview&quot;, which will host hundreds of thousands of Halo Insiders, focuses on arena gameplay versus bots as well as the Academy&#x27;s weapon drills.
As already announced, Halo Infinite is the franchise&#x27;s first foray into the world of multiplayer bots. 343 will use the technical previews to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance, and to that end will debut the Bot Arena playlist, which puts four players against four bots on arena maps. For the technical preview, the bot arena experience features Slayer across three maps: Bazaar, Recharge, and Live Fire.

                    <span>The developer of Splitgate never expected its open crossplay beta to be so popular.
The free-to-play sci-fi competitive multiplayer shooter, which has been described as &quot;Halo meets Portal&quot;, launched an open crossplay beta on 13th July. This let PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One players all play with and against each other for the first time.
Splitgate has been knocking around on PC since May 2019 with a relatively small player base, but the crossplay beta sparked an explosion of popularity (to the tune of half a million downloads) that caused severe server problems. So severe, in fact, that developer 1047 Games was forced to take the beta offline.

                    <span>A raft of Blizzard developers have taken to social media to criticise reported corporate statements issued on the recent allegations made against the company.
This week, the State of California sued Activision Blizzard over what it alleges to be a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
The lawsuit alleges a culture of &quot;constant sexual harassment&quot;, mainly at Blizzard Entertainment, the maker of World of Warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch.

                    <span>Frontier Developments has shared fresh details on its dino-park management sim sequel Jurassic World Evolution 2, talking up the likes of improved dinosaur behaviour, a new scientist role, habitant enhancements, and more in the first of a series of developer videos.
The original Jurassic World Evolution, which released in 2018, was an atmospheric, if ultimately rather shallow take on the classic theme park management sim formula, tasking players with building and maintaining their own dinosaur wonderland by laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and researching new amenities - all while ensure the attractions didn&#x27;t rampage.
Frontier has already teased a few of the new features coming to Jurassic World Evolution 2 later this year, but its inaugural developer diary video goes a little deeper into some of the elements its hoping will convince punters to delve into their wallets a second time around.

                    <span>Black Book, the Slavic-folklore-inspired dark RPG adventure from developer Morteshka, now has a release date and will be coming to Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 10th August.
Morteshka - which also developed the similarly striking, Finno-Ugric-inspired The Mooseman - describes Black Book as a &quot;fusion of card-based RPGs and adventure games&quot;, playing out against a bleakly beautiful rendition of 19th century rural Eastern Europe.
Players take on the role of Vasilisa - a young witch with the ability to control demons, still reeling from the death of her betrothed - and must set out in search of the legendary Black Book, said to have the power to grant one wish to those that locate its seven seals.

It was released the following year on the Xbox and the PlayStation 2. 
To celebrate, Remedy Entertainment, the developer of the first two instalments, released an anniversary video featuring Sam Lake, the primary writer of the game and whose likeness was used for Max Payne himself, and James McCaffrey, the voice actor of Payne. The video also features the iconic black leather jacket worn by Payne.

                    <span>It&#x27;s a feature that Red Dead Online players have requested almost since the game&#x27;s launch, but the ability to purchase properties in Red Dead Redemption 2 - aside from the Moonshiner role - has sadly remained a distant dream. While the feature is yet to appear in the game&#x27;s online mode, modders have stepped in to finally introduce a properties system to the single-player version of the game on PC: so you can now choose your own little house on the prairie. One without Uncle constantly complaining about lumbago.
The Buyable Properties mod was released by modders Bolmin and &quot;Dick Hertz&quot; last week, and provides players with a selection of purchasable hotel rooms and cabins. It&#x27;s a mod intended for use in the game&#x27;s epilogue map, and serves as a useful way to spend all your leftover epilogue cash. You can even decorate your house with a variety of interior and exterior upgrades - check out the video below for a demonstration (but spoilers, obviously, for the end of Red Dead Redemption 2&#x27;s story):
There are three customisable houses to choose from (based in the Heartlands, near Strawberry and near Rhodes), which are marked on the map with a little &quot;house to buy&quot; sign. While you can have a nap in the houses and use some of the items stored in them, their functionality is a little limited at present - although there are apparently plans to add weapon lockers in the next update. If you want something a little fancier, there&#x27;s always the hotel room option, which this mod allows you to buy permanently.

                    <span>World of Warcraft players have staged an in-game protest following recent allegations made against developer Blizzard.
This week, the State of California sued Activision Blizzard over what it alleges to be a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
The lawsuit includes a number of disturbing allegations and alleges a culture of &quot;constant sexual harassment&quot; mainly at Blizzard Entertainment, the maker of World of Warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch.

                    <span>Respawn sure seems to be busy right now - not only is it beavering away on Apex Legends (and reportedly a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order), but we&#x27;ve also heard news about a new IP - and it seems this one is going to be a single-player game. 
A number of new job listings have been posted on Respawn&#x27;s website, with creative director Mohammad Alavi describing the project as a &quot;brand new Respawn single-player adventure&quot;. Details on the game remain light, but the postings do note that the project is &quot;in its early stages&quot;, while the single-player title is apparently &quot;a designer&#x27;s dream playground with a freedom to innovate made possible by the unique universe it inhabits.&quot;
According to a tweet in April by Respawn developer Steven Kah Hien Wong, the team is building a new IP &quot;from scratch&quot;. So before you start asking about Titanfall 3 again, it seems like this is something brand new.

                    <span>It looks like a new Overwatch map was going to be revealed yesterday, before the announcement was pulled. 
In an article that&#x27;s now been taken offline, Dexerto reported that a new Deathmatch map called Malevento, based in Italy, was to be added to the Public Test Region. 
According to the article, the map &quot;features a mix of both tight corridors and more open outdoor areas, leading to a blend of close-quarters combat while still leaving the door open for the likes of Widowmaker to excel from afar&quot;.

The speedy new vehicle is the game&#x27;s most realistic to date, with its model taken from the car configurator software Ferrari used to design the model, and now offers to customers to customise.
Like Fortnite, this software uses Unreal Engine - so not only is this a neat addition for the game, it&#x27;s also a digital showroom for Epic Games&#x27; engine.

Last week we reported on how scalpers had taken to eBay with their £4 Steam Deck reservations, marking up the PC handheld by hundreds of pounds.
There were multiple listings of the Steam Deck on eBay, all charging more than Valve&#x27;s asking price. Some listings had the hardware up for sale for over £1000.

Creative director Paul Sage, UX/Game Feel director Chris Strasz and lead character artist Kevin Penrod have also departed. All are intending to work together on a new indie project.

                    <span>There are certain things I don’t want a discount on — a quality parachute, for example.

                    <span>A Catholic priest was outed through commercially available surveillance data. Vice has a good analysis:
The news starkly demonstrates not only the inherent power of location data, but how the chance to wield that power has trickled down from corporations and intelligence agencies to essentially any sort of disgruntled, unscrupulous, or dangerous individual. A growing market of data brokers that collect and sell data from countless apps has made it so that anyone with a bit of cash and effort can figure out which phone in a so-called anonymized dataset belongs to a target, and abuse that information...</span>

                    <span>January 2020 saw the arrival of Blizzard&#x27;s highly anticipated Warcraft 3 remake, Reforged, but the celebratory mood quickly soured once fans realised the game failed to deliver much of what was initially promised and took away even more. Now, a report from Bloomberg has shed new light on the behind-the-scenes decision-making that lead to such a disastrous outing for one of Blizzard&#x27;s most beloved games.
When Reforged was originally announced at BlizzCon 2018, Blizzard sold it as a significant overhaul of its classic real-time strategy game. However, the final version was plagued by bugs, brought broken online play, and was absent of expected features promised in its initial reveal, including improved cutscenes and re-recorded voice overs. It even stripped out elements from the original Warcraft 3, such as leaderboards and clans.
So significant was the negative response to Reforged, Blizzard eventually implemented an on-request refund policy, but the question remained why the company thought it was even remotely acceptable to ship a product in such an shoddy state to begin with.

                    <span>Football Manager is getting women&#x27;s football in the future, developer Sports Interactive has announced.
This is not via a separate standalone Football Manager game - rather, it is via complete integration into the mainline Football Manager.
The addition of women&#x27;s football won&#x27;t make it into FM22, Sports Interactive boss Miles Jacobson told Eurogamer in an interview today. But women&#x27;s football is coming - and could be added to FM post-launch in the middle of its year-long life cycle.

                    <span>Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s producer and director Naoki Yoshida has told players they &quot;don&#x27;t need to show so much restraint [they] stop having fun&quot; following his request they make a few concessions to accomodate newcomers while Square continues to addresses server issues caused by a sudden surge in the MMO&#x27;s popularity.
A record number of players have flocked to the now-decade-old MMO in recent times (Steam saw an all-time peak of 67,019 concurrent players earlier this week), and while that&#x27;s undoubtedly boon for the long-term health of the game, the sheer number of people wanting to get involved has caused serious server congestion, resulting in lengthy queue times and players being unable to create new characters.
On Tuesday, Yoshida apologised to Final Fantasy 14 players for the ongoing technical woes, assuring them Square is doing everything it can to improve matters. A recently released patch has implemented an automatic logout for AFK players as an &quot;emergency measure to combat congestion&quot;, for instance, and login caps have been raised on North American servers.

                    <span>First it was rumoured, now it&#x27;s official: EA is giving Visceral Games&#x27; much-loved sci-fi horror classic Dead Space the remake treatment on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The original Dead Space launched back in 2008, sending players, in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke, on a terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura, its crew slaughtered by nightmarish creatures known as the necromorphs.
What followed was a deliciously atmospheric third-person horror adventure that saw players embarking on the mother of all fixer-uppers in order to reactive the ship and locate Isaac&#x27;s missing partner Nicole, engaging lasers to sever innumerable necromorph limbs along the way.

                    <span>Apex Legends&#x27; latest character Seer was introduced in a Stories from the Outlands video earlier this week, and we now know a little more about his abilities. Oh, and there&#x27;s a snazzy new video for the new season.  
During this evening&#x27;s EA Play event, game director Chad Grenier discussed Seer&#x27;s abilities, describing him as similar to Bloodhound and &quot;all about tracking enemies&quot;. Aiming down the sights will bring up a heartbeat sensor that will hint at an enemy&#x27;s location. His tactical, meanwhile, sends drones out of his chest to reveal and track an enemy&#x27;s location. Seer&#x27;s ultimate also makes use of his microdrones, using them to create a sphere that senses enemies who move through it.  
For those who are concerned Seer may be a little bit too similar to Bloodhound, Grenier assured players that the new legend is more about stealth, and is able to gather &quot;precise and lingering information&quot;.

The details come via a now-deleted article on Game Rant, which revealed maps from Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 3 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 will feature, alongside the armies and factions from those games and a selection of their arsenal. Players will be able to mix and match elements - so it&#x27;s possible, it&#x27;s said, to pit WW2 soldiers against Battlefield 2042&#x27;s all-new specialists. 
Players will be able to adjust settings, and there&#x27;s also mention of an in-depth logic editor which allows more granular adjustments.

                    <span>Battlefield fans have spotted the return of a classic map buried in a teaser video that plays when players boot up one of the current Battlefield games.
YouTube creator VickeP first spotted an image in the teaser that looked awfully familiar. He captured the frames of the video that showed the clearest view of the image and stuck it into Photoshop to produce the clearest image. It showed what appears to be huts and powerlines:
He shared the image on reddit, where people noticed the image looked like Battlefield Bad Company 2&#x27;s map Valparaiso. Vicke then compared the image to gameplay footage of Valpariso and found an exact match. This really is a reflection of just how amazing the collective power of gaming communities can be.

                    <span>Fans of super-person pile-ons and animated stuff are in luck; developer Netherrealm&#x27;s acclaimed superhero fighting series Injustice: Gods Among Us is getting the animated movie treatment courtesy of DC and Warner Bros. Animation.
That&#x27;s according to the Hollywood Reporter, which says the film - to be released under the DC Animated Movie banner - will draw inspiration from Netherrealm&#x27;s video game titles as well as writer Tom Taylor&#x27;s Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year One, a comic book prequel to the games.
Its animated action will reportedly unfold on an alternate version of Earth where the Joker has successfully managed to trick Superman into killing Lois Lane, sending the superhero on a rampage of destruction. &quot;This unhinged Superman decides to take control of Earth for its own good,&quot; says the Hollywood Reporter, &quot;leading Batman and his allies to attempt to stop him.&quot;

                    <span>Yesterday saw the beta launch of Amazon&#x27;s much-delayed MMO New World, and early gameplay reports have been generally positive. Considerably less, positive, however, are the increasing number of posts from players saying that New World has also successfully managed to brick their pricey RTX 3090s graphics cards - an issue Amazon has now gone some way to acknowledging on its official support forum.
Word of New World&#x27;s potentially hardware-busting abilities first surfaced on the MMO&#x27;s dedicated sub-reddit. &quot;I just bricked a 3090 in the main menu after setting my graphics quality to medium and hitting save,&quot; wrote user greyone78. &quot;Cant believe it. Anyone else had a catastrophic failure like this?&quot;.
Multiple responses seem to confirm that, yes, this isn&#x27;t an isolated issue, and further reports of RTX 3090 malfunctions after playing New World (primarily seeming to impact cards made by EVGA) began to spread to Twitter and beyond, along with speculation the problem may be the result of power spikes and overheating caused by uncapped frame rates in the game&#x27;s menus.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot going on in the world of The Witcher over on Netflix, with the streaming service currently working on three separate projects based on author Andrzej Sapkowski much-loved fantasy novels. First out of the gate, though, is animated movie The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, and it&#x27;s just received its first proper trailer ahead of its launch on 23rd August.
Nightmare of the Wolf, which was announced at the start of last year, is a prequel to Netflix&#x27;s main live-action show and focusses on Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s friend and mentor Vesemir, &quot;long before&quot; the two meet. Indeed, it&#x27;ll supposedly hurtle back in time to the start of Vesemir&#x27;s journey as a Witcher, &quot;after the mysterious Deglan claims him through the Law of Surprise&quot;.
Netflix offered a brief glimpse of Nightmare of the Wolf earlier this month, but the streaming service has now given Witcher fans a more substantial look at the movie in its first proper trailer, in which a dashing Vesemir flirts, quips, and slays his way to adventure.

                    <span>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Elite Squad will shut down a year after launch, Ubisoft has announced.
Elite Squad, developed by Owlient, the Paris-based studio behind horse breeding games, is a kind of Tom Clancy all-stars action RPG for mobile devices drenched in a Fortnite-esque graphics style.
A trailer shown at last year&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward event starred Splinter Cell&#x27;s Sam Fisher - complete with iconic night vision goggles - alongside characters from the likes of Rainbow Six (Montagne and Caveira), Ghost Recon (El Sueño from Wildlands) and The Division.

                    <span>The developer of Humankind has pulled the Denuvo DRM from the game ahead of launch in August.
Amplitude Studios&#x27; Sega-published Civilization-style strategy game was set to use Denuvo in a bid to prevent it from being cracked by pirates - at least in the short term.
Denuvo has always been a controversial digital rights management (DRM) tool when it comes to PC games.

                    <span>Pokémon Go Fest 2021 earned £15.4m ($21m) in two days, according to numbers from app store analytics firm Sensor Tower. 
The Saturday of last weekend&#x27;s ticketed event was one of the most lucrative days for the game since its stratospheric launch in July 2016, though was just pipped by the one-day Kanto Tour event earlier this year. (Across the weekend, Go Fest was still the clear winner.)
Pokémon Go recently passed the $5bn lifetime player spending total, and in 2021 has notched up $731m so far - putting it on track for this year to be its most profitable yet.

                    <span>Poor old Saitama - not only is he having problems getting people to recognise him for his abilities, but now the servers for his game are set to shut down. 
Bandai Namco announced the news in a tweet, explaining that the multiplayer servers for One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows will go offline on 28th February next year. Offline game modes and &quot;online 1v1 game matches&quot; will still be playable, but that&#x27;s the end of the fighting game&#x27;s online multiplayer modes. 
One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows is a 3D arena fighting game based on the One Punch manga and anime. It was released on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 28th February 2020, meaning the online servers will close after exactly two years of life. The game received mixed reviews from players on Steam, and according to SteamDB only ever reached a peak of 586 concurrent players - with only five people playing when I checked this afternoon. I guess the game&#x27;s title was, er, suitable.

                    <span>Valve has confirmed that the UI from Steam Deck OS will replace Big Picture mode on Steam. 
This was discovered after Valve employee austinp_valve responded to a question in the Steam Big Picture forum about the future of the interface. 
Big Picture was released in 2012 as a console-like interface for users who plugged their PCs into large monitors and tv while using a controller as opposed to keyboard and mouse. It became the basis for SteamOS which was used for the ill-fated Steam Machines.

                    <span>Good news for Fallout 76 building enthusiasts, as Bethesda is bringing custom servers to the game, allowing you to remove CAMP building limits and construct a home wherever your heart desires. If you&#x27;re paying for a Fallout 1st subscription, that is. 
Fallout Worlds is a new system that&#x27;s set to arrive in the live game this September, and it&#x27;s already been rolled out to Fallout 76&#x27;s public test server. It includes a feature called Custom Worlds, which allows players to tweak world rules such as where CAMPs can be placed, the permitted size of CAMPs, or whether &quot;free building&quot; is allowed. Which basically sounds like a creative mode.
It seems there are some options for PvP players, too: the combat section of the world settings allows players to tweak the difficulty of the world, such as the AP cost of using VATS and Melee. There&#x27;s also an option to turn on infinite ammo, so you could essentially turn Fallout 76 into your own personal paintball game.

                    <span>Netflix will have a mobile-first approach to its venture into video games, at least initially. 
This is according to the service&#x27;s Q2 earnings report, which outlined that it was at &quot;the early stages of further expanding into games,&quot; and viewed &quot;gaming as another new content category for us.&quot;
This isn&#x27;t the first time Netflix has tried its hand at games, having released a Stranger Things mobile game on iOS back in 2017, and Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, an interactive film back in 2018.

                    <span>Goldlewis Dickinson is the first Guilty Gear Strive DLC character, Arc System Works has announced.
Goldlewis Dickinson is a character in the Strive story mode - he&#x27;s the Secretary of Defense and active soldier of the United States.
As a playable character, Goldlewis Dickinson is an enormous on-screen presence, and wields a coffin that appears to house an alien from Area 51. Yep, Guilty Gear is certainly out there with its character designs.

The concepts come from the same Nintendo &quot;gigaleak&quot; of information as many other recent revelations, as fans continue to sift through its treasure trove of data. 
Included below are looks at alternative button types, arrangements and names - though all keep the Wiimote&#x27;s TV-like remote shape.

                    <span>Konami has officially renamed the PES series to &quot;eFootball&quot;, and made it free-to-play and digital-only.
The dramatic shift begins with this year&#x27;s game, simply titled eFootball, which is due out on consoles, PC and mobile with cross-play.
eFootball, out this autumn, is built on Unreal Engine - another first for the famous football video game franchise. The trailer below shows off a brief snippet of gameplay:

On April 23, 2021, the Release Team merged a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) changing the Kubernetes release cycle from four releases a year (once a quarter) to three releases a year.
This blog post provides a high level overview about what this means for the Kubernetes community&#x27;s contributors and maintainers.
What&#x27;s changing and when
Starting with the Kubernetes 1.22 release, a lightweight policy will drive the creation of each release schedule. This policy states:
The first Kubernetes release of a calendar year should start at the second or third
week of January to provide people more room after coming back from the
winter holidays.
The last Kubernetes release of a calendar year should be finished by the…</span>

                    <span>If your thirst for animated video game adaptations is somehow yet to be sated despite the best efforts of Netflix and its ilk, here&#x27;s another in-development adaptation to toss onto the ever-growing list: Player Unknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds.
PUBG developer Krafton Inc. has announced it&#x27;s working on an animated &quot;project&quot; based on the popular battle royale title in conjunction with Adi Shankar, who served as producer and showrunner on Netflix&#x27;s acclaimed Castlevania adaptation and is the creator of the streaming service&#x27;s upcoming Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix animated series.
&quot;As a player, I&#x27;ve been crushing the competition in the Battlegrounds since PUBG released in 2017,&quot; Shankar wrote in a statement accompanying the announcement. &quot;To me, this animated project represents another step in the evolution of mending the torched bridge between the games industry and Hollywood. I look forward to revealing to everybody what winning a chicken dinner looks like.&quot;

                    <span>Road 96, the intriguing procedural road trip adventure from 11-11: Memories Retold developer Digixart, will be making its way to Switch and PC next month, on 16th August.
Unfolding during a long, hot summer in the mid-90s, Road 96 takes players on an ever-changing hitchhiking adventure across the authoritarian nation of Petria as they attempt to reach the border and start a new life.
Along the way, as Digixart explains, players will &quot;meet incredible characters, and discover their intertwined stories and secrets... But every mile opens up a choice to make. Your decisions will change your adventure, change the people you meet, maybe even change the world.&quot;

                    <span>Lone Echo 2, the sequel to developer Ready at Dawn&#x27;s acclaimed 2017 zero-gravity VR adventure, finally - after a series of coronavirus-related delays - has a release date, and will be heading to Oculus devices on 24th August.
Lone Echo 2, which was initially announced back in 2018 for a release the following year, picks up after the events of the first game, catapulting protagonists Captain Olivia Rhodes and player-controlled android Echo One (nicknamed &quot;Jack&quot;) 400 years into the future, where an abandoned space station holds the key to returning home.
Once again, Ready at Dawn has crafted a moody sci-fi adventure built around zero-gravity traversal and puzzling, with the developer promising &quot;sharp visuals&quot;, &quot;complex challenges&quot;, and &quot;startling discoveries&quot; as its &quot;emotional&quot; far-future story unfolds.

                    <span>Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s producer and director Naoki Yoshida has addressed the recent server congestion issues blighting the long-running MMO following a &quot;staggering and unexpected&quot; increase in the game&#x27;s popularity.
&quot;Final Fantasy 14 is currently experiencing a dramatic increase in its player base,&quot; Yoshida explained in a post to the game&#x27;s website. &quot;Recently, we have experienced record user numbers in all regions, with a vast amount of new players beginning their adventures.&quot; Indeed, the game successfully smashed its record for concurrent players on Steam earlier this month, reaching 47,542 concurrent players versus the previous record of 41,200 set in June 2019.
Although undoubtedly a boon for the potential longevity of the now-decade-old MMO, this &quot;extreme influx&quot; of new players, as Yoshida puts it, has placed a strain on Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s servers, with congestion issues causing lengthy queue times and preventing players from creating new characters.

The former professional footballer, who played for Arsenal in the Women&#x27;s Super League and made 140 appearances for England, is the first female broadcast voice in EA Sports&#x27; FIFA series.
In the example shown to press during a recent preview event, the new English-speaking commentary team of Derek Rae and ex-Arsenal and West Ham player Stewart Robson, the latter of whom replaces Lee Dixon for FIFA 22, is interrupted by the news of a goal at another match, reported by Scott.

FIFA 22 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC (yes, PC gets the last-gen version) will be the most-played version of the game, given the enormous install base of the last-gen consoles versus the supply-constrained and newer current-gen.
So, it&#x27;s worth running through what those who intend to play FIFA 22 on last-gen will get that&#x27;s new in terms of gameplay.

                    <span>Ever felt like Fallout 4 could stand to be a little more, well, Blair Witch? If you fancy stumbling around in the dark while being chased by unseen forces, this might be the mod for you. 
The Wilderness is a chunky Fallout 4 PC mod by El Ha that offers a worldspace &quot;at least as big&quot; as Nuka World, with a bunch of abandoned buildings and a spooky main quest. It&#x27;s a map that often feels deliberately barren, with the player encouraged to traverse vast distances in search of shelter and supplies. Thanks to the gloomy atmosphere created through a combination of bad weather and a synth-heavy soundtrack, it&#x27;s easy to get jumpy - and you&#x27;ll probably find yourself getting creeped out by the landscape as much as the actual jumpscares. Any good horror is about tension, after all. 
On installing the mod, players are presented with a fast travel option north of Sanctuary called &quot;The Wilderness&quot;. Travelling there (and walking forwards a little bit) will transport you to The Wilderness itself, a vast wasteland that feels a lot more abandoned than anything in the Commonwealth. You can explore the area in your own time if you fancy, but to start the main quest, you&#x27;ll need to rummage around in the skeleton near the start area. This will give you your first map and a rather ominous quest message about avoiding &quot;whatever is following you&quot;.

Gunzilla Games opened in November 2020 with $25m funding to &quot;create a new generation of AAA shooters.&quot; It has an impressive and exhaustive list of talent that previously worked for the likes of Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, THQ, Crytek, and more.

Fortnite&#x27;s battle royale island is set to feature a rainbow in its sky, while Fortnite Creative now features pride items to decorate maps with.

                    <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator developer Asobo Studio is set to add helicopters to the game. The bad news is they are planned for 2022.
The developer stealthily announced the news in its 15th July development update, which revealed a snapshot of the most requested features and reported bugs. The introduction of helicopters was by far the most requested feature with over 1500 votes. We have yet to see any more details about it, but I can&#x27;t imagine it will be too long before Asobo gives us a glimpse. 
Other requested features include support for multiple screens, DirectX 12 support, replay functionality, and a myriad of other features. The top bugs include incorrect weather and wind readings, game crashes, low-resolution textures and performance issues on some PCs.

                    <span>A follow-up to the BAFTA award-winning My Child Lebensborn is in the works. 
My Child Lebensborn was a heart-wrenching game about caring for children born of war. Specifically, children born during World War 2 to Nordic women and German soldiers, and registered in the Nazi Lebensborn programme. It would lead to lives of persecution, abuse and bullying.
The game was released on mobiles in 2018, and won the Game Beyond Entertainment BAFTA in 2019. My Child Lebensborn was released more recently on Steam, and Xbox and PlaySation consoles, in June this year.

F1 2021 launched for PC, PlayStation and Xbox last month. Ray-tracing in the game&#x27;s PC and Xbox Series X versions remains unaffected.

                    <span>If you were ever tempted to splash out on lifetime premium membership for Nexus Mods, it&#x27;s now or never, as the mod platform is removing the option in August. 
Nexus Mods yesterday published a blog post detailing upcoming changes to its billing system. While Nexus Mods is usable for free, premium membership has been an option on the platform since 2007, providing perks such as ad-free browsing and uncapped mod download speeds. The current membership options are split into 1-month, 6-month, 12-month and lifetime plans, but that&#x27;s set to change on 3rd August. 
&quot;Since we first started offering Premium Membership, our billing system... has been handled by our Invision Board forums software and PayPal,&quot; Nexus Mods explained. &quot;To be frank, it&#x27;s old, archaic, held together by duct tape and glue and was never really intended to be used by a site as big as ours. It&#x27;s so delicate, we have not been able to update our Premium Membership pricing since 2013 because doing so breaks many different elements of the billing and Premium membership system which we have no control over as the code is not ours.

                    <span>A revealing Fortnite leak has been doing the rounds over the past few days, with details on upcoming events, crossovers and spoilery story information. 
The leak, which was originally shared with moderators of the /r/Fortniteleaks reddit, appears to come from someone with an intimate knowledge of Fortnite&#x27;s upcoming plans, and who has leaked detail on multiple seasons in the past.
This new dump of information is the most eye-opening yet, however, with details on some of Fortnite&#x27;s plans for the rest of this year and possibly next. And with today&#x27;s new Fortnite patch, v17.20, the first element of the leak has already been spotted in the wild.

                    <span>NSO Group, the Israeli cyberweapons arms manufacturer behind the Pegasus spyware — used by authoritarian regimes around the world to spy on dissidents, journalists, human rights workers, and others — was hacked. Or, at least, an enormous trove of documents was leaked to journalists.
There’s a lot to read out there. Amnesty International has a report. Citizen Lab conducted an independent analysis. The Guardian has extensive coverage. More coverage.
Most interesting is a list of over 50,000 phone numbers that were being spied on by NSO Group’s software. Why does NSO Group have that list? The obvious answer is that NSO Group provides spyware-as-a-service, and centralizes operations somehow. Nicholas Weaver ...</span>

                    <span>Ubisoft has unveiled its previously teased &quot;new Tom Clancy game&quot;, revealing it to be XDefiant, a 6v6 free-to-play first-person shooter that, just as leaks suggested, mashes up factions from Ghost Recon, The Division, and Splinter Cell.
In its announcement video, Ubisoft calls XDefiant a &quot;high-octane&quot; arena shooter - playable solo or with friends - that features an &quot;irreverent and rebellious&quot; take on the normally serious Clancy vibe, alongside &quot;realistic gunplay&quot; and personalised classes in the form of factions. 
Each faction is said to offer its own &quot;gameplay and team dynamics&quot;, as well as unique passive traits, ultras, and abilities that will &quot;change the moment-to-moment gameplay&quot;. Players will be able to mix and match any faction, load out, and weapon - Ubisoft promises an &quot;arsenal of authentic weapons and attachments&quot; - and these can all be switched at will during a respawn.

                    <span>As promised, EA has shared &quot;a little something&quot; related to its its highly anticipated Skate revival after announcing there&#x27;d be no news on the latest instalment of its long-dormant skateboarding series during this Thursday&#x27;s EA Play Live. Skate fans probably shouldn&#x27;t get too excited though; beyond confirmation that the game is still in the works, there&#x27;s little to see here.
Announced last June, EA&#x27;s Skate revival - the fourth game in the series and the first instalment since 2010&#x27;s Skate 3 - is being worked on by recently formed studio Full Circle, which counts original Skate creators Deran Chung and Cuz Parry among its number.
Given that Full Circle only formally came into existence at the start of this year, work on the new Skate game is unsurprisingly still in its early stages, and Chung said as much in EA&#x27;s new teaser video. &quot;The truth is it&#x27;s still early,&quot; he explained. &quot;We&#x27;re still working on it&quot;.

                    <span>Respawn has released a new Stories from the Outlands video, and this one is all about new character Seer: a cursed legend with microdrones and a very cool hat. 
Metamorphosis tells the story of Seer&#x27;s childhood, explaining that &quot;a bad omen cast a shadow&quot; over his birth, and that his glance &quot;can turn a mountain to dust, a king to a beggar and an ocean to a desert&quot;. It&#x27;s a stunning video, and if you&#x27;re wondering why the art style looks familiar, that&#x27;s because the trailer was made in collaboration with animator Robert Valley, who&#x27;s known for series Love, Death and Robots.    
The Apex Legends website gives a little more detail on the upcoming season, Emergence, and some further snippets of info about Seer. Apparently Seer wields microdrones and has an &quot;artist&#x27;s eye&quot;, which allows him to &quot;spot opportunities that other Legends might miss, and seize them in the most beautiful way he can&quot;. A new LMG called the Rampage is also being introduced next season, and it apparently has a &quot;surprising&quot; amount of firepower. The new season will also introduce that much-anticipated Ranked mode for Arenas.

                    <span>Pokémon Go pulled off its big annual Go Fest event at the weekend with enjoyable gameplay and some excellent storytelling flourishes. In-game and in the real world, developer Niantic dropped an array of teases for the game&#x27;s future, and seemed to nimbly avoid the technical snafus seen in the past when millions of people have logged on to play simultaneously.
Go Fest 2021 was ostensibly about Meloetta, the Mythical Pokémon said to inspire music. The event&#x27;s first day was spent putting together a band of Pokémon creatures via a Choose Your Own Adventure-style experience which summoned Meloetta to catch at the end.
Day two of the event, on Sunday, was supposedly just about raiding - though Niantic had some other surprises in store. As the first day wrapped up at 6pm local time, a new Mythical creature suddenly appeared on Pokémon Go&#x27;s loading screen. Then, from 2am, the game&#x27;s skybox suddenly changed to a galactic background, dotted by mysterious animated portals.

                    <span>Amazon New World creative director David Verfaillie has said the studio &quot;definitely&quot; heard the feedback from the community regarding potential paid in-game boosts. 
New World is the imminent MMO from Amazon that&#x27;s based around an Age of Discovery kind of idea. You set sail for a magical island with a powerful magical secret, and try to make a home there. Its key features are territory ownership and housing, and player versus player warfare, in addition to a large fantastical world to battle with and explore.
Verfaillie was referring to the paid quality of life and experience boosters players found evidence of during New World&#x27;s concluded alpha test. These suggested you might be able to pay for things like rested experience, which can help you level up faster, as well as fast travel.

A suspiciously-familiar adventurer with a whip and an officially-licensed Spelunky costume both feature in the battle royale&#x27;s new battle pass.
This season also sees the introduction of duos and trios matches, as well as Limited Time Events with challenges and unique rewards.

Tencent previously owned an 8.75 percent stake in Sumo, whose development credits also include additional work on Forza Horizon 2, LittleBigPlanet 3, Disney Infinity and Team Sonic Racing.

                    <span>EA is continuing to manage expectations for this year&#x27;s EA Play Live, confirming that the next Skate game will not be making an appearance during the show. 
As explained in a tweet from the official Skate account, new studio Full Circle was only formed back in January, and as such the team is not quite ready to show the game. &quot;It&#x27;s still early and we are committed to doing this thing right which means it&#x27;s gonna take some time,&quot; the statement said.  
It&#x27;s not all doom and gloom, however: the statement said the team is &quot;stoked to share a little something with you all tomorrow&quot;, so it seems we&#x27;ll be getting some form of Skate news this week after all. Perhaps we&#x27;ll finally get a name, or even a teeny tiny teaser.

                    <span>Nintendo has taken the unusual step of responding to a recent Bloomberg report on the upcoming Switch OLED.
Bloomberg, which led reporting earlier this year on the upcoming Switch remodel, reported last week that the OLED model was being priced higher to give Nintendo a better profit margin compared to the original Switch. Without naming Bloomberg, Nintendo issued a rare tweet to state &quot;the claim is incorrect&quot;.
Nintendo went on to clarify that, beyond Switch OLED, it had &quot;no plans for launching any other model at this time&quot;, pouring cold water on the suggestion a further new model might be in the works.

From the report:
Summary:
Candiru is a secretive Israel-based company that sells spyware exclusively to governments. Reportedly, their spyware can infect and monitor iPhones, Androids, Macs, PCs, and cloud accounts.
Using Internet scanning we identified more than 750 websites linked to Candiru’s spyware infrastructure. We found many domains masquerading as advocacy organizations such as Amnesty International, the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as media companies, and other civil-society themed entities.

                    <span>Ubisoft will announce a new game set in &quot;the Tom Clancy&#x27;s universe&quot; tomorrow, 19th July, 2021.
The developer/publisher refrained from detailing anything else other than confirming that the reveal would take place at 7pm UK time (11am PT) tomorrow, 17th July, and shared a curious three-second-long teaser that features a lot of stickers and neon. Here, take a look for yourself:
The tweet links to a YouTube video entitled &quot;New Tom Clancy&#x27;s Game Worldwide Reveal&quot; and promises &quot;things are going to get wild&quot;.

&quot;Just to make sure as many people here know as possible, Take-Two have been going heavy with the DMCAs this week, first starting with GTAV map mods like GTA3 Portland, Vice City Overhaul, etc,&quot; writes Ash_735 on the official GTA Forums (thanks, PC Gamer).
As Ash puts it, an agreement to help the publisher and the modding community peacefully coexist was struck a little while back when Take-Two &quot;tried to make modding GTA games illegal&quot;.

                    <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator will reportedly take up almost 100GB on Xbox consoles.
The news came via Twitter user Idle Sloth, who showed that if you select &quot;Manage with Game Pass&quot; on the the game&#x27;s Xbox Store page, it&#x27;ll give you the full install size: 97.2GB.
As our pals at Pure Xbox report, that&#x27;s just the standard edition, too, so depending upon what flavour current-gen Xbox you&#x27;re running - the X or S - and what edition you&#x27;d like to play, it may take up even more than that.

&quot;The Last of Us which commences photography this week is indeed a monster,&quot; Petti told CTV News. &quot;It has five art directors and employs an army of hundreds of technicians. It has had six months of prep and shoots (in Alberta) for 12 months.&quot;

                    <span>Ghost of Tsushima developer Sucker Punch has &quot;re-enabled&quot; four PlayStation-inspired Legends outfits in celebration of its very first anniversary.
Inspired by characters from God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Shadow of the Colossus, and Bloodborne, the outfits had originally only been available for a limited time over the Christmas holidays. Now, however, they can be unlocked by completing any Legends Story or Survival mission with each class.
That&#x27;s not all, though. The team also took the time to share some stats about the Ghost of Tsushima, including the revelation that since it launched a year ago, collectively there have been 679.2 million standoffs, 333.1 million duels, 68.5 Haikus written, and together we&#x27;ve taken 61 million in-game photos.

Developer Digital Extremes made the announcement during this weekend&#x27;s TennoCon 2021, which also showed off the shooter running on mobile devices, too.
While a concrete release date has yet to be confirmed, it does mean the Warframe faithful will be able to team up with pals playing on other consoles such as Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One before the end of the calendar year.

There are multiple listings of the Steam Deck on eBay, all charging more than Valve&#x27;s asking price. Some listings have the hardware up for sale for over £1000.
Valve made the Steam Deck available to reserve last night with some smart restrictions aimed at combating scalpers (although some of these restrictions ran into technical issues as Valve was inundated with high demand).

Activision has vowed not to make Call of Duty pay-to-win and so, when it adds new weapons into the likes of Warzone and Black Ops Cold War, you&#x27;re able to unlock them through gameplay challenges.
It&#x27;s as simple as that, except it&#x27;s not always simple to unlock these weapons. And the Black Ops Cold War challenge for the recently-released OTs 9 left some players frustrated due to its difficulty.

The player in question, known as Pyrophoric, took to the War Thunder forum on Wednesday night to post an image from a Challenger 2 battle tank Army Equipment Support Publication (AESP) - like a user manual - to try to convince developer Gaijin Entertainment the in-game version isn&#x27;t authentic to the real-life version.
According to a post by the UK Defence Journal, the image had its &quot;UK Restricted&quot; label crossed out, with an &quot;UNCLASSIFIED&quot; stamp added. Various parts were reportedly fully blacked out.

Last week the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced it had shut down what was reported as a cryptocurrency mining farm that contained an incredible 3800 game consoles. Images showed racks of PS4 Slims (some claimed the photos showed PS4 Pros) - either way not the ideal hardware for a cryptocurrency farm.
It turns out the PS4s were being used to grind FIFA Ultimate Team.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone developer Raven Software has issued its first anti-cheat update in over two months following increasing pressure from the game&#x27;s community over hacking.
Complaints about cheating and hacking in Warzone have ramped up this year, with some high-profile players calling for action from Activision.
Earlier this month, popular Call of Duty content creator ZLaner made an impassioned plea to Raven to do something to combat cheating.

                    <span>Looking for some more speedrunning to watch following this year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick? There&#x27;s plenty more where that came from, as all-women speedrunning event Flame Fatales is taking place next month. 
The online event is taking place between 15th-21st August, and will be broadcast on the Games Done Quick Twitch channel. There&#x27;s a real variety of games listed in the lineup, with everything from Warframe to a 15-card run of Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories. There are speedrunning favourites like Celeste and Super Metroid, along with some stranger entries like Disney&#x27;s 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue. Oh, and I&#x27;m also glad to see there&#x27;s also a Fire Emblem: Three Houses run in there. 
The event is being held in support of Malala Fund - a non-profit organisation founded by Malala and Ziauddin Yousafzai in 2013, which works to &quot;champion every girl&#x27;s right to 12 years of free, safe, quality education&quot;. Flame Fatales raised $80k (£63.8k) for Malala Fund last year, and since 2010, Games Done Quick events have raised over $34m (£24.6m) for charity.

Earlier this year, Gabriel Luna was cast as Tommy, the main character Joel&#x27;s brother. Now, Pierce has instead been cast as Perry, a rebel in a quarantine zone. 
Murray Bartlett and Con O&#x27;Neil have also been cast in the series. Bartlett will play Frank while O&#x27;Neil will play Bill. Deadline described the characters as &quot;two post-pandemic survivalists living alone in their own isolated town&quot;.

                    <span>Details were spilled online last night by the ever-reliable datamining group PokéMiners - which then prompted a hurried response from developer Niantic, seemingly aiming to quickly set expectations.
Go Fest 2021 is themed around the Mythical creature Meloetta, which will become available in-game for the first time. But the leak suggests Niantic also plans to tease the game&#x27;s next Mythical creature as a surprise.

                    <span>Path of Exile: Royale has returned, Grinding Gear Games has announced.
Path of Exile: Royale was a temporary game mode for the free-to-play action role-playing game added as an April Fool&#x27;s joke in 2018. It pit 100 players in a last-man-standing match on a large island as a pisstake of the battle royale obsession of the time.
Grinding Gear Games always intended for this mode to be short-lived, but it&#x27;s now launched a new and improved version of Path of Exile: Royale, which has new features and separate balance from Path of Exile&#x27;s core game.

                    <span>Valve boss Gabe Newell has described hitting the Steam Deck PC&#x27;s basic price point of £349/$399 as &quot;painful&quot; but &quot;critical&quot;.
The Steam Deck was announced by Valve last night, with pricier options set to cost £459/$529 for a 250GB SSD and £569/$649 for a 512GB SSD.
In an interview with IGN, Newell said Valve had set out to be &quot;very aggressive&quot; with its pricing - the basic model is just $50 more than Nintendo&#x27;s significantly less powerful Switch OLED - but that it had been tough to achieve.

Instead, EA said in a tweet last night, &quot;all of us look forward to celebrating with you next year when we share our vision for the Galaxy far, far away!&quot; 
Huh. Never mind EA Play Live - that sounds like we won&#x27;t see any new Star Wars games until 2022.

This week, Raven quietly added a new feature to Warzone that on paper was very useful indeed: pre-match lobby loadout selection for core battle royale modes.
This let players edit, pick and use their custom loadout in the pre-game lobby in core battle royale modes.

Introduction
Are you interested in learning about what SIG Usability does and how you can get involved? Well, you&#x27;re at the right place. SIG Usability is all about making Kubernetes more accessible to new folks, and its main activity is conducting user research for the community. In this blog, we have summarized our conversation with Gaby Moreno, who walks us through the various aspects of being a part of the SIG and shares some insights about how others can get involved.
Gaby is a co-lead for SIG Usability. She works as a Product Designer at IBM and enjoys working on the user experience of open, hybrid cloud technologies like Kubernetes, OpenShift, Terraform, and Cloud Foundry.

                    <span>Two days after releasing its summer update for Red Dead Online, Rockstar has announced its next summer update for GTA Online. 
The update, due on 20th July, introduces the Los Santos Tuners, an underground car meet featuring &quot;a gigantic, shared social space&quot; plus Tuner-based missions and races. 
New races include the self-explanatory Street Race series, the Pursuit series, with sparsely placed checkpoints for players to find their own routes, and Sprint, a point-to-point race in freemode.

The co-op shooter was due out on PC and Xbox Series X and S this year.
Warhammer 40,000 Darktide is the promising-looking next game from Fatshark, the developer of the much-loved Vermintide series of fantasy Warhammer games.

                    <span>After a year of research, Pokémon Go fans have uncovered a hidden mechanic involved in catching creatures from raid battles.
The research, published today by fan resource The Silph Road, appears to show a secret modifier that boosts the likelihood of catching a raid boss over the course of an encounter.
Simply put, the longer it takes you to catch a boss, the more likely it becomes that your next Premier Ball throw will actually do so. Or, as The Silph Road reports: &quot;You are more likely to catch the raid boss on the 10th throw of the encounter than on your first.&quot;

                    <span>Raven has teased some upcoming changes to Call of Duty: Warzone in the latest patch notes for the battle royale.
The developer plans to update the High Alert perk to let players hear Dead Silent footsteps. Currently, all High Alert does is make your vision pulse whenever enemies outside of your view see you. By then, of course, it&#x27;s often too late.
This change to High Alert is important for anyone who plays Warzone - a game in which your ability to hear your enemy coming can make the difference between winning and losing a gunfight.

                    <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick is all wrapped up, but if you&#x27;re looking for another exciting speedrun to watch, this world record-breaking blindfolded Super Mario Bros. run seems like a good place to start. 
Speedrunner Crescendo posted a video of the world record run last night, with the timer showing that he managed to beat the game in 11 minutes and 55 seconds. It appears the previous record was held by speedrunner dodai, who achieved a time of 14 minutes and 46 seconds back in 2016. 
This all sounds impressive on paper, but the run itself makes for remarkable viewing: at one point Crescendo has to accurately count down the seconds needed to run a sufficient distance before making a series of perfect jumps. He uses fireballs as an echolocation device, and is able to figure out his surroundings from the noise they make when hitting a wall. He also seems to break bricks to figure out his position.

Raven has talked about making it so it takes longer to kill an enemy in Warzone for some time now.
This morning, a sweeping weapon balance pass, which Raven called &quot;the biggest balance update in the history of Warzone&quot;, has seen some weapons heavily nerfed. Guns such as the SCAR, Oden, both AK-47s and the FAL all took a hit, with a particular focus on reducing torso multipliers.

Re:Verse had been given a vague July launch window, after previously being delayed from launching alongside Village back in May.
This latest setback, of at least six months, is the most major yet - though it doesn&#x27;t come as too much of a surprise. Fan response to Re:Verse&#x27;s beta was mixed to say the least, and Capcom said today it needed more time &quot;to deliver a smooth gameplay experience&quot;.

Don&#x27;t expect any differences, outside of the box and cartridge. Nintendo has also yet to set a price, though in the US the digital and physical versions are sold for the same amount.

                    <span>Minecraft maker Mojang has released a new Caves and Cliffs test live for PC, and fans are seriously impressed by the changes it makes.
The 1.18 experimental snapshot allows for some truly spectacular world generation, including realistic-looking mountain peaks and Mines of Moria-like cave structures. 
The only thing which disappointed me was these &quot;cheese&quot;, &quot;spaghetti&quot; and &quot;noodle&quot; caves were not actually places you could mine out Italian foodstuffs. (Those names simply reflect the holey or elongated shapes created by the snapshot&#x27;s cave generation algorithm.)

                    <span>YouTube is getting several new live-streaming features today, and they may seem rather familiar, as all three of them have been popular features on Twitch for some time. 
As spotted by The Verge, YouTube streamers will now be able to create polls inside their chats, and limit the chats to subscribers-only. Viewers will now also be able to create clips of streams. 
Although the features are hardly the most original, they should give YouTube streamers a little more control over their communities. The subscribers-only chat option is a useful way to moderate discussion and discourage any unwelcome drive-by comments from new viewers. Polls provide another way for viewers to stay engaged with the action - and are a handy tool for streamers looking to find out what their community wants to watch next.

                    <span>Netflix is moving forward with its plans to get into gaming in a big way. 
The streaming giant has now hired former EA, Oculus and Zynga exec Mike Verdu as vice president of game development, Bloomberg has reported, and is set to add its first games to its subscription offering within the year.
There&#x27;s no detail yet on what the mix of games will look like, to what extent Netflix will make its own original games, or whether any big franchises you&#x27;ve already heard of will be part of the plans.

As the Kubernetes API evolves, APIs are periodically reorganized or upgraded.
When APIs evolve, the old APIs they replace are deprecated, and eventually removed.
See Kubernetes API removals to read more about Kubernetes&#x27;
policy on removing APIs.
We want to make sure you&#x27;re aware of some upcoming removals. These are
beta APIs that you can use in current, supported Kubernetes versions,
and they are already deprecated. The reason for all of these removals
is that they have been superseded by a newer, stable (“GA”) API.
Kubernetes 1.22, due for release in August 2021, will remove a number of deprecated
APIs.
Kubernetes 1.22 Release Information
has details on the schedule for the v1.22 release.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 will feature cross-play between PC and console players, with some limitations and opt-outs.
PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners will all be able to play together, with the option to opt-out of mixing PC and console groups if you so choose.
Separately, PS4 and Xbox One console players can also play together, but separate from other platforms. This makes sense, considering last-gen platforms feature 64 instead of 128-player matches.

                    <span>Rockstar has dropped Red Dead Online&#x27;s PlayStation Plus requirement for two weeks to coincide with the release of its new Blood Money update.
PlayStation players can play Red Dead Online without a PlayStation Plus subscription from 13th to 26th July, Rockstar said. It costs £17.99 from the PlayStation Store.
Red Dead Online currently requires Xbox Live Gold to play, but it&#x27;s worth noting it&#x27;s included with Xbox Game Pass.

                    <span>The recent story surrounding the notion of a pirate, DRM-free &#x27;cracked&#x27; version of Resident Evil Village out-performing Capcom&#x27;s launch code had me in turns fascinated and horrified. I can accept that anti-piracy measures are a necessity, and I can equally accept that their sophistication these days may have a certain level of CPU overhead. However, putting out a game that has performance issues because of the DRM crosses a red line - it&#x27;s something that a developer or publisher absolutely should not do. And yet, I can confirm that Resident Evil Village on PC in its cracked form does run smoother than the flawed official release.
In fact, the compromised code addresses the two key performance issues my colleague Alex Battaglia noted in his Resident Evil Village PC tech review. Firstly, key…</span>

For individual games, there&#x27;s a new 85 percent revenue split for titles sold after 1st October up until the end of 2023, and up until the first $3m earned. This is similar to both Google and Apple&#x27;s app store policies, which also take just 15 percent of the revenue cut compared to the industry standard 30 percent, up to a certain threshold.

                    <span>Remember that Bloodborne PSone demake project that imagined what the game would look like if it had been transported back through the console generations? Well, the team has provided us with another update video to show their progress, and they&#x27;ve now managed to recreate an entire PSone-style boss fight in Unreal Engine 4. 
Developer Lilith Walther, who&#x27;s an Unreal Engine 4 tech artist and also lead programmer on indie JRPG Witch, shared a video of the boss fight on Twitter. It shows the player taking on Father Gascoigne, and features cutscenes, destructible gravestones and music produced on a Roland SC-88 for &quot;maximum authenticity&quot;. You can take a look at the full video below:  
It&#x27;s seriously impressive work, and personally I think the atmosphere in the &quot;PSone&quot; version feels even spookier than in the original game. The comparison video showing the same cutscene in Bloodborne and the demake is also well worth a watch:

The Titanic Mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven aims to do exactly what it says on the tin, which is to put the RMS Titanic in Mafia. This isn&#x27;t just any old 3D model seen from a distance, however - the mod team is trying to make &quot;one of the most detailed and accurate free 3D recreations of the Titanic ever made&quot;. Players will be able to explore the ship in freeroam mode, and the work done so far really does look stunning:
On top of all that, the mod even comes with its own storyline. It promises fully voice-acted missions, complete with cutscenes and a new soundtrack.

Treyarch first added the nuke scorestreak to Black Ops Cold War without an announcement in May, during season three, to the Cranked Hardpoint mode. It was the first time a Treyarch Call of Duty had the nuke scorestreak.

The creator of the cheat, who goes by the name &quot;USER101&quot;, has slapped a statement on the website for User Vision Pro, which Activision took steps to scrub from the internet after console competitive multiplayer fans expressed concern about its potential to ruin games.
A new version of existing cheat User Vision Pro was set to use machine learning to analyse gameplay footage in real-time before sending inputs to a controller.

                    <span>China is making sure that all newly discovered zero-day exploits are disclosed to the government.
Under the new rules, anyone in China who finds a vulnerability must tell the government, which will decide what repairs to make. No information can be given to “overseas organizations or individuals” other than the product’s manufacturer.
No one may “collect, sell or publish information on network product security vulnerabilities,” say the rules issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China and the police and industry ministries.

This just blocks the cyber-arms trade. It doesn’t prevent researchers from telling the products’ companies, even if they are outside of China...</span>

A raft of popular Warzone streamers were shocked to see their accounts hit the maximum level 1000 while playing last night, and all Black Ops Cold War weapons in the game hit maximum level, complete with all camos unlocked.
Yes, even the incredibly difficult to obtain Dark Matter camos for these weapons were unlocked.

                    <span>PUBG Mobile really has been through the wringer in India: its popularity in the country led to concerns that children were spending too long playing the game, and several Indian cities placed bans on the game in 2019 after blaming it for promoting violent behaviour. Then, in 2020, PUBG Mobile was banned across the entire country following increased tensions between China and India. As the game was published by Chinese company Tencent, PUBG Mobile was included in the list of 118 apps banned in India over security concerns. 
But it seems PUBG Corp wasn&#x27;t quite ready to give up, and a new version of the game is already seeing massive success. 
Battlegrounds Mobile India is the new (but still not particularly catchy) name of PUBG Mobile in India, and it&#x27;s off to a roaring start. The game launched on 2nd July, and now has 34 million registered players, 16m daily active users, and a peak concurrent player count of 2.4 million. And apparently it&#x27;s not even on the Apple App Store yet (via Times of India).

The delay will allow the studio to finish the project while protecting the health of staff at the studio, Tango said in a statement issued via Twitter today.
Ghostwire: Tokyo was previously set to launch for PS5 and PC this October, with a year&#x27;s console exclusivity before arriving on Xbox - despite the fact Tango&#x27;s parent company Bethesda is now part of Microsoft.

                    <span>The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection PC port now has some graphics options.
The collection launched last month and was immediately found wanting, with severely limited customisation and graphics options.
To play in fullscreen mode you had to launch the game and then click the maximise icon in the upper-right of the title bar. At launch the game started in windowed mode every time.

                    <span>Patch notes detail numerous visual improvements such as 4K textures for the game&#x27;s user interface, 60 FPS pre-rendered cut-scenes and improvements to the game&#x27;s anti-aliasing, global illumination and ambient occlusion/bloom. 
It has been four years since Nier: Automata arrived on Steam, and three months since we first heard some form of &quot;upgrade patch&quot; was at last on the way.

                    <span>Frontier Developments has delayed Elite Dangerous&#x27; Odyssey update on consoles indefinitely to focus on fixing the PC version.
In a post on the Frontier forum, chief David Braben said the studio accepts the &quot;frustration&quot; players have had with the Odyssey expansion since it came out in May.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched, quickly accruing a &#x27;Mostly Negative&#x27; rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.

                    <span>Surprise! Lighting Returns: Final Fantasy 13 just got a surprise patch five years after the game came out on PC.
Square Enix&#x27;s role-playing adventure, which launched on PC in December 2015, received an update to fix an issue with Lightning&#x27;s voice not being played in some scenes, according to a note on Steam.
How random! Or is it? As many fans have already speculated, this update may be more about tidying up the game ahead of a launch into Xbox Game Pass.

                    <span>The body of the watch appears to be the same as the company&#x27;s existing Connected Wear OS smartwatch, which costs around the same amount, albeit with a lick of extra raid paint, a red Mario &quot;M&quot; on the crown and a red strap.
The main draw here is an animated watch face featuring Mario, with Easter eggs as you hit certain points towards your daily step count. 2000 of the watches will be produced.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone gets its first ever objective-based mode this week.
It&#x27;s called Payload, and it arrives as part of the Season Four Reloaded refresh, which kicks off 5am UK time this Thursday, 15th July.
Payload is inspired by Call of Duty: WW2&#x27;s War Mode (a mode I very much enjoyed), Activision said in a blog post. In it, two teams of 20 players fight against each other in a race against time to obtain intel from vehicles that are carrying satellite parts.

An Ultimate Edition version of the game will also launch on that date, wrapping in Jungle Awakens, Creeping Winter, Howling Peaks, Flames of the Nether, Hidden Depths, and Echoing Void DLCs for a discount. 
Another free content update will also arrive then too, with a new maze-like mission, Gauntlet of Gaze, plus fresh enchantments.

The special shirted Pikachu was due to be the game&#x27;s first regional costumed creature - with more suggested to be on the way. 
But developer Niantic has now issued an update to say the release will no longer occur - &quot;due to recent developments&quot;.

                    <span>Respawn has been battling hackers in its online games for some time, but the situation escalated recently when hackers blocked players from accessing Apex Legends in order to complain about hacking in Titanfall. And unfortunately it seems the saga is having an impact on Respawn&#x27;s development plans, with work on at least one highly-anticipated feature for Apex Legends, cross-progression, slowed by the recent spate of attacks.  
Earlier this week Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier responded to a question about cross-progression on Twitter, explaining that &quot;recent hacks on Apex and TF have slowed down the progress of it&quot;. He added that the studio needed to &quot;context switch to solving live game issues&quot;. 
Although cross-platform play was implemented in Apex Legends last year, players have so far been unable to transfer progress between accounts on different platforms (aside from moving between Steam and Origin). It&#x27;s a feature the team seems eager to introduce, with Grenier explaining via Reddit that implementing it will be &quot;much harder post-launch since users may have multiple accounts to merge or use&quot;. Given the ongoing problems with hacking in Apex Legends and the Titanfall games, it sounds like it could be a little while longer before we see this feature implemented.

LeBron James&#x27; appearance is timed alongside this week&#x27;s release of Space Jam: A New Legacy, the live action and animated Looney Tunes film sequel in which he stars.
There will be two LeBron skins - Majesty, which reflects his King nickname, and one with Tune Squad and Casual styles, reflecting his Space Jam outfit and... I guess how he hangs out at home in shorts.

                    <span>Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima has said he doesn&#x27;t like the name of his expanded Death Stranding: Director&#x27;s Cut. 
In a series of tweets this morning, Kojima compared the typical use of the term Director&#x27;s Cut in the movie business, and what had happened here. 
Kojima&#x27;s reasoning is the PlayStation 5 version&#x27;s new features were all developed after the original Death Stranding released, rather than it being a new version of the game assembled from cut content.

                    <span>EA is facing a backlash over its decision to make FIFA 22 on PC the last-gen version of the game.
Fans have criticised the move, which was confirmed last night when EA unveiled the game alongside its debut trailer, below.
FIFA 22 has what EA calls &quot;HyperMotion&quot; gameplay, which combines machine learning with 11v11 motion capture to improve how players move during a match.

Eurogamer has verified the process of receiving a beta key works, though the code we received - 1234-5678-9012 - appears to be a placeholder.

                    <span>After a week of weird and wonderful speedruns, this year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick event came to an end on Sunday - with a total of $2.8m (£2m) raised for charity. 
This year the online speedrunning event was raising money for Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), a charity that provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disasters, epidemics or exclusion from healthcare. The donations from the latest event mean that Games Done Quick has now raised over $34m (£24.5m) for charity in total. 
As you may have noticed from Twitter, one of the highlights of this year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick was a GeoGuessr speedrun, in which player Havrd managed to figure out his locations with remarkable accuracy. The Pokémon Black and White any percentage race between PulseEffects and Swiftalu, meanwhile, came down to the last five seconds. You can check out both of these highly entertaining speed runs below - or check out the full catalogue of runs on GDQ&#x27;s YouTube channel.

                    <span>EA has changed the way its dual entitlement program works for FIFA 22 so that the next-gen upgrade is only available to those who fork out £89.99 for the Ultimate Edition.
EA unveiled FIFA 22 on Sunday with a 1st October release date and debut trailer, below, and with the announcement came confirmation that only those who buy the digital-only Ultimate Edition get both the last-gen and current-gen versions of the game.
This is a marked change compared to the dual entitlement program for FIFA 21, which offered a free next-gen upgrade to owners of all versions on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

                    <span>A pristine sealed copy of Super Mario 64 has sold for $1.56m (£1.12m), setting a record for the highest amount anyone has paid for a video game at auction. 
Heritage Auctions, which handled the sale, has shifted numerous rare games in the past, but nothing with a price close to this.
Still, interest in rare or vintage video games is on the rise. The previous record was set only last week, for an unopened NES copy of the original Legend of Zelda. That went for $878k (£633k).

While the former scrambled to rename the listing as &quot;Licensed Video Game Cookbook&quot;, it wasn&#x27;t changed in time to prevent Wario64 from snapping a screenshot of the Insights Editions book and details on its contents.

                    <span>Bloober Team has responded to fan speculation that its new partnership with Konami could mean there&#x27;s a new Silent Hill game on the way.
Following the recent discovery of EU funding applications from the studio for a number of codenamed projects - including H2O, Black, and Dum Spiro - fans are speculating that either one of the latter two games could be related to Silent Hill.
Bloober CMO Tomasz Gawlikowski, however, has clarified that the scope of these projects have changed considerably since the funding applications were filed.

                    <span>Someone has worked out how to parachute into ongoing Gulag fights and eliminate enemy players.
The exploit is particularly egregious given the opposing player is unable to damage the invincible interloper at all. Check out the brief video below to see how it works in action:
Right now the YouTuber who first publicised the exploit has refrained from explaining how it can be done, but has teased in their comment section that they will &quot;post how to do it in a couple [of] days&quot;.

                    <span>Unhappy Resident Evil Village players are blaming DRM for the game&#x27;s poor performance on PC. 
&quot;All in-game shutters like the one from when you kill a zombie are fixed because Capcom DRM&#x27;s entry points are patched out so most of their functions are never executed anymore,&quot; explained hacker Empress, who claims playing a pirated version of the game without Capcom&#x27;s anti-tamper V3 and Denuvo V11 &quot;results in [a] much smoother game experience&quot;.
DSO Gaming tested the theory for themselves and played a two-hour snippet of a cracked version. Despite killing numerous enemies, they said they &quot;did not get a single stutter during these two hours&quot;.

                    <span>Washington D.C. and 36 states have filed a lawsuit against Google for alleged antitrust practices.
As reported by Politico (thanks, TheGamer), the lawsuit - which was filed on Wednesday, 7th July 2021 in California and led by Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah - reportedly challenges the megacorp&#x27;s control of the Android app store.
The filing takes umbrage with Google&#x27;s plans to take a 30 per cent cut of all digital goods and services sold via its Play Store from September and is just one of several ongoing litigation battles taken out against the company over Google&#x27;s perceived search engine and advertising monopolies.

A modder known as Zel is spearheading the effort, whichuses the Zelda &#x27;97 &quot;overdump&quot; as well as data from the infamous Nintendo &quot;gigaleak&quot; of July 2020.

In conversation with Nier chief Yoko Taro during a special Final Fantasy 14 livestream, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida indicated the hotly-anticipated game will skip this year&#x27;s TGS, which kicks off at the end of September.
In comments translated by Twitter user @aitaikimochi and Siliconera, Yoshida said the team wants to show Final Fantasy 16 shortly before the game launches, rather than drip feed fans snippets of information over a long period of time.

Dallas, Texas-based Heritage Auctions said this cart is an early production copy of the first game in the Zelda series, and &quot;is no doubt the apotheosis of rarity, cultural significance, and collection centerpieces&quot;.

CD Projekt made the announcement in a tweet about Witcher 3&#x27;s next-gen update, due out on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S at some point this year. The update is free for all who own the game.

                    <span>Following its entirely underwhelming first footage reveal of The Witcher TV show&#x27;s second season earlier this year (all 12 seconds of it), Netflix has finally shared a first proper trailer for Season 2 as its newly confirmed 17th December release draws nearer. And here it is now!
As part of tonight&#x27;s WitcherCon, a livestream collaboration between CD Projekt and Netflix, the streaming service has announced that the long-awaited second season of its live-action Witcher TV series will arrive on 17th December this year.
That means fans will have been waiting almost exactly two years by the time Season 2 arrives (its predecessor debuted in December 2019), with the long gap between seasons largely the result of coronavirus-related filming delays. With filming wrapped and post-production now well underway, though, Netflix is finally ready to talk specifics and has confirmed Season 2 will once again consist of eight episodes, all of which have now had their official names revealed.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s animated Witcher movie, Nightmare of the Wolf, will officially arrive on 23rd August, and there&#x27;s a first look at its action in a new teaser trailer to celebrate the news.
Announced back at the start of last year, Nightmare of the Wolf focusses on Geralt of Rivia&#x27;s friend and mentor Vesemir, and is set &quot;long before&quot; the two meet. In fact, previous word from Netflix suggests it&#x27;ll wind the action all the way back to the start of Vesemir&#x27;s journey as a Witcher, &quot;after the mysterious Deglan claims him through the Law of Surprise&quot;.
And if that&#x27;s left you sufficiently intrigued, you can see Netflix&#x27;s first teaser trailer for Nightmare of the Wolf below. Animation is being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind Legend of Korra - while Lauren S. Hissrich and Beau DeMayo, respectively showrunner and writer on the main live-action Witcher series, are both involved.

                    <span>A video game collector has come across what is believed to be evidence of the &quot;SNK Millennium&quot; console - 20 years after it was rumoured to be in the works.
Anthony Bacon, from Chicago (who we&#x27;ve featured multiple times on Eurogamer before), was sent a mystery SNK motherboard earlier this year and asked to investigate by its owner.
This board had a long journey to Bacon&#x27;s desk. His friend, Brian Hargrove, bought a lot of SNK motherboards from Yahoo Auctions Japan 15 years ago, not having any idea what they were. He sold the board in question to a friend of his called Max, who five months ago contacted Bacon to ask if he could work out what it was.

                    <span>Snowman and Land &amp; Sea has announced that Alto&#x27;s Odyssey, the endless sand-surfing game from 2018, is getting a special edition. Alto&#x27;s Odyssey: The Lost City comes to Apple Arcade on 16th July.
The Lost City is a sort of revisiting of the original game, allowing players to &quot;venture deeper into the endless desert to uncover its best-kept secret.&quot; The game adds a new biome - the Lost city - and expands upon the original design with new secrets and challenges. The idea is to give returning players something fresh to tease at, while allowing new players to see what the game&#x27;s all about in the first place.
The teaser trailer promises lavish mystery and paper lanterns - always a lovely mix. If you have played the original game, your save data will carry across too, which is pretty great. Can&#x27;t wait for this one.

In a message to fans, Lanning today thanked the Oddworld series&#x27; community for their feedback and patience while the latest game in the series was improved. 
Now, seven updates later, Soulstorm stands &quot;refined&quot;, Lanning said. &quot;Major fixes&quot; include updates to Abe&#x27;s movement, aim, and stealth. Enemy AI has been improved, and several levels have been rebalanced. The game&#x27;s PlayStation 5 trophies have been rejigged, and DualSense support now extends to being able to feel Abe&#x27;s heartbeat at times of stress.

                    <span>Sony has removed a PlayStation 5 advert which showed the console placed upside down.
Fans spotted the incorrectly-positioned PS5 in the video yesterday, posted to Twitter. Overnight, the advert was quietly deleted from the internet.
The heartwarming ad began with a dad telling his son a bedtime story. Thinking of his current God of War playthrough, the dad starts telling his son a tale of how a father and son went for a walk in the mountains. The cherubic child quickly falls asleep.

                    <span>Arkane Studios, the developer behind the likes of Dishonored and Prey, has been teasing Deathloop for quite some time now, and the wonderfully stylish recursive stealth shooter has looked captivating at every turn. And the tantalising glimpses continued tonight with nine new minutes of gameplay footage, as shown during Sony&#x27;s latest PlayStation State of Play.
First, the basic premise for those unfamiliar; in Deathloop, players take on the role of Colt, an assassin who finds himself trapped in an endless time loop on the mysterious Blackreef island. In order to escape, he&#x27;ll need to take out eight targets known as the Visionaries before the day ends - but if he fails (or dies) time rewinds and he&#x27;ll need to start over.
All isn&#x27;t lost, however; by exploring further in each successive loop, players can gain valuable clues they&#x27;ll be able to use next time around to locate and eliminate their targets before the day ends - and Arkane&#x27;s latest gameplay footage focusses on an attempt to bring down the Visionary known as Aleksis &quot;The Wolf&quot; Dorsey.

Combat has been expanded with upgraded melee attacks, a laser gun and mounted machine guns. There&#x27;s also a cargo gun that launches packages over long distances, a support skeleton to let you carry even more, and a cute buddy bot who can carry loads and run alongside you.

                    <span>Developer Megagon Industries&#x27; wonderfully serene (and deliciously infuriating) mountain bike adventure Lonely Mountains: Downhill is a brilliant thing, but given that it&#x27;s also a year and a half old now, fans may be hoping for a bit of a shake-up. And what do you know? Megagon&#x27;s newest update is here to do just that, wafting away the threat of encroaching staleness with a range of new Daily Ride challenge modifiers.
Daily Rides, if you&#x27;ve not yet checked them out, are daily cross-platform leaderboards that challenge players to do their best in a randomly selected trial, with participants able to unlock various cosmetic rewards, refreshed each season, along the way. Today&#x27;s update marks the start of Lonely Mountains&#x27; seventh season, Summer Strolls, and introduces those aforementioned modifiers to freshen things up for players.
Today&#x27;s Daily Ride, for instance, rolls out the new Changed Checkpoints modifier - which, as its name suggests, changes and adds new checkpoints to the trail - but future modifiers for the season have also been revealed (and you can see a few of them in the trailer below).

                    <span>Rockstar has started removing GTA Online jobs.
Rockstar warned jobs such as races, missions, adversary modes and survivals will be cycled in and out over time as they add more to the game.
We&#x27;ve verified the Bombushka Run Adversary Mode is currently not in GTA Online. Bombushka Run was added to GTA Online as part of the continuation of the Smuggler&#x27;s Run update in September 2017.

This Time It&#x27;s Virtual (Sam &amp; Max&#x27;s first entirely new video game outing since Telltale Games&#x27; The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse in 2010) is the work of developer HappyGiant, which promisingly includes Sam &amp; Max creator Steve Purcell and a number of ex-LucasArts alumni who all worked on the studio&#x27;s seminal 1993 point-and-click adventure Sam &amp; Max: Hit the Road - writer/designer Mike Stemmle, creative director Mike Levine, and concept artist Peter Chan.
Additionally, David Nowlin and Dave Boat, who&#x27;ve voiced Sam and Max previously in a number of Telltale titles, are reprising their roles as the dubious dog and bunny duo.

It arrives in an update-filled Access All Areas edition, which includes the various additions brought into the game since its original launch a year ago as an Epic Games Store timed exclusive.
There&#x27;s a four-player story campaign and the usual competitive multiplayer mode, too.

As Eurogamer reported last week, a recent Guilty Gear Strive patch stealth removed reference to Uyghur, Tibet and Taiwan in a China-related lore entry.
Neither Guilty Gear Strive publisher Bandai Namco nor developer Arc System Works have commented, despite repeated requests from Eurogamer.

The in-development cheat, brought to light by the Anti-Cheat Police Department Twitter account this week, claims to use machine learning to analyse gameplay footage in real-time before sending inputs to your controller.
Eurogamer will not disclose the name of the cheat or publish the original video.

The Los Angeles-based studio has previously assisted DICE on its Battlefield series, and is doing so again with the upcoming Battlefield 2042 - more on that below.
But Ripple Effect Studios is also now creating its own new project, after Vince Zampella, boss of Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order developer Respawn Entertainment, took on an expanded role in January as &quot;head coach&quot; of the now-renamed team.

That&#x27;s a steady uptick from the last couple of sales milestones announced by the publisher - 3m at launch in May, then up to 4m after 20 days. 
Village&#x27;s predecessor Resident Evil 7 has shifted 9m copies since its launch in 2017, though only sold 3.5m after nine weeks. Village is selling faster, then, and looks on track to potentially overtake 7 as the biggest-selling entry in the series.

                    <span>Dark Souls 3 has just received a new lease of life on Xbox Series consoles, thanks to the transformative powers of FPS Boost. The From Software classic now targets 60 frames per second on the new wave of Microsoft consoles, replacing the somewhat wobbly 30fps of the Xbox One rendition of the game. We had early access to the FPS Boosted rendition of the game and it certainly does the job, delivering nigh-on flawless performance on Xbox Series consoles.
This is a much-requested upgrade for Xbox Series X and S owners, bringing the game closer into line with its performance profile on PS5. Dark Souls 3 released on last-gen systems in 2016 with a firm 30fps cap, but many months later, a PlayStation 4 Pro patch removed the limit, offering frame-rates up to 60fps. Unfortunately, the value of the upgrade was questionable at the time, owing to a highly variable level of performance on Sony&#x27;s enhanced machine. However, in the long run, it worked out - PlayStation 5&#x27;s backwards compatibility horsepower locks the game to 1080p60.
Unfortunately, From Software never went back to the Xbox One version of Dark Souls 3 to add One X support, meaning that 900p30 has been the upper limit of performance on Xbox consoles since the game&#x27;s original launch. Not only that, in common with From&#x27;s other 30fps console offerings, inconsistent frame-pacing added a certain degree of judder to the game, something baked into the engine that extra back-compat horsepower could not address. Today&#x27;s FPS Boost upgrade overrides the frame-rate cap to give Xbox Series X and S the same, smooth experience 60fps as PS5, with no judder, hitches or stuttering.

This weekend’s attack was carried out with almost surgical precision. According to Cybereason, the REvil affiliates first gained access to targeted environments and then used the zero-day in the Kaseya Agent Monitor to gain administrative control over the target’s network. After writing a base-64-encoded payload to a file named agent.crt the dropper executed it.
[…]
The ransomware dropper Agent.exe is signed with a Windows-trusted certificate that uses the registrant name “PB03 TRANSPORT LTD.” By digitally signing their malware, attackers are able to suppress many security warnings that would otherwise appear when it’s being installed. Cybereason said that the certificate appears to have been used exclusively by REvil malware that was deployed during this attack...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait, but console fans of 11 Bit Studios&#x27; celebrated post-apocalyptic city builder Frostpunk will finally be able to get their hands on Xbox and Playstation versions of the game&#x27;s three expansions from Wednesday, 26th June. 
Frostpunk launched on consoles toward the end of 2019, introducing its narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder - in which players must overcome gruelling conditions to keep their fledgling community alive in a desolate sub-zero world - to a legion of new fans.
Since then, three distinctive expansions have released on PC, building upon Frostpunk&#x27;s punishing but wonderfully compelling core in interesting new ways, and it&#x27;s these that will finally debut on consoles later this month.

                    <span>Switch owners with a taste for cracking yarns, urban fantasy, and a smattering of demonic possession have a bit of a treat in store; developer Wadjet Eye&#x27;s superb point-and-click adventure Unavowed is available on Nintendo&#x27;s platform from today.
Unavowed - which is the work of Dave Gilbert, the designer behind Wadjet Eye&#x27;s renowned Blackwell series - was enormously well-received when it released on PC back in 2018, receiving much acclaim for its ambitious structure and wonderfully compelling storyline.
It sees players taking on the role of a (somewhat definable) character who&#x27;s spent the last year terrorising New York City in a demonically possessed frenzy - and who now, after intervention from a crack team of supernatural specialists, finds themselves in the employ of an ancient, evil-battling secret society and ready to put their recent mistakes right.

The Snapchat video, which appears to show Griezmann as well as teammate Ousmane Dembele mocking Asian technicians during Barcelona&#x27;s tour of Japan in 2019, has sparked a vociferous backlash amid racism allegations.
According to ESPN, in the video Dembele says to Griezmann: &quot;All these ugly faces, just so you can play PES, aren&#x27;t you ashamed?&quot;

                    <span>A popular third-party Call of Duty: Warzone stats tracker app is back online after its creators held successful talks with Activision.
Warzone Tracker was one of a number of overlay apps on the Overwolf network that were disabled earlier this year following an update to the battle royale.
This update, issued in response to an Activision API terms of service breach by a separate app on the Overwolf framework, had the knock-on effect of blocking Overwolf entirely, preventing its use while the PC version of Warzone was in use.

The Infinity project that will include the games made by both these teams will be led by Marc-Alexis Côté, who will now serve as executive producer of the entire Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise. Côté worked on Brotherhood before becoming creative director on Syndicate, and is one of the most senior staff at Ubisoft Quebec.

                    <span>I once said that AWS has launched so many services that I could talk about a service that didn&#x27;t really exist and not get called out for it–by AWS employees. Sure enough, last week saw the rise of AWS Infinidash, an imaginary AWS service that doesn&#x27;t (at the time of this writing) really exist.
The post The Lessons of AWS Infinidash appeared first on Last Week in AWS.</span>

                    <span>Publisher Nacon has delayed the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong. Originally scheduled to arrive this year, the narrative RPG is now due to launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and PC in February 2022.
Swansong, which was announced back in 2019, is the work of Big Bad Wolf, the studio behind episodic adventure game The Council, and places players into the shoes of three different vampires, each belonging to a different clan within the vampire sect of The Camarilla.
&quot;Weaving between their intertwined tales,&quot; Nacon explained at the time of Swansong&#x27;s reveal, &quot;the player has to confront the different points of view of his characters to unravel fact from fiction. With whispers of conspiracy, murder and power struggles, the player must protect his clan, discover the truth and above all enforce the Masquerade, the vampire law designed to conceal the existence of creatures of the night from humans.&quot;

                    <span>Spiders - the French studio behind the scrappy but lovable RPG likes of GreedFall and The Technomacer - has shared first gameplay footage of its offbeat new action-RPG, Steelrising.
Steelrising, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, features a deliciously high-concept premise, unfolding in a heavily reimagined version of 18th century Paris, where players are cast as Aegis, one of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s automaton bodyguards, and charged with tracking down their maker in a bid to stop Louis XVI&#x27;s army of rogue robots.
Steelrising got its big reveal last summer, when Spiders shared a wonderfully atmospheric teaser trailer offering a glimpse of Paris&#x27; battle-ravaged streets and glorious automaton creations. And now, following a second cinematic trailer in June, the developer has provided a first look at Steelrising&#x27;s gameplay, predominantly focussing on its flashy third-person combat.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been quite some time since iconic 80s action-movie antihero RoboCop had a video game to call his own (he last appeared on PC and consoles over 18 years ago, re-emerging with a free-to-play mobile offering in 2014), but it&#x27;s been revealed everybody&#x27;s favourite cyborg security professional will be making a long-awaited gaming comeback in RoboCop: Rogue City.
RoboCop: Rogue City, which is set for release on PC and currently unannounced consoles some time in 2023, is the work of developer Teyon (the studio responsible for the critically savaged Terminator: Resistance and Rambo: The Video Game), and will feature an &quot;original story&quot; based on the events of the first three RoboCop films.
Beyond the fact that players will take on the role of  RoboCop himself - &quot;Become the iconic hero whose [sic] part man, part machine, all cop as you attempt to bring justice to the dangerous, crime-ridden streets of Old Detroit in RoboCop: Rogue City,&quot; teases publisher Nacon in its press release - specifics are currently a little scarce.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve known for a while that Kylotonn Racing is working on an all-new Test Drive Unlimited, and now we finally know where it&#x27;ll be set, with Hong Kong set to be the backdrop for the open world racer. 
The location was revealed in today&#x27;s Nacon Connect with another CGI trailer which teased some further details including a doubling down on the bling-obsessed lifestyle elements. We also got to see what the backdrop of Hong Kong will offer, from its muddy shores to its hyper-colourful streets through to its glorious hills. 
Hong Kong has been a popular destination for previous video games, of course, from Shenmue 2 to the beloved Sleeping Dogs. It follows on from Test Drive Unlimited&#x27;s Oahu setting, while its sequel headed to Ibiza (and missed out on the opportunity for a Wayne Lineker cameo - for shame).

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s upcoming live-action Witcher prequel, Blood Origin, has confirmed another new cast member, with Star Trek: Discovery&#x27;s Michelle Yeoh now set to appear as sword-elf Scian.
The Witcher: Blood Origin is a new six-part series set 1,200 years before Netflix&#x27;s Henry-Cavill-starring main Witcher show and will chart the creation of the prototype Witcher, as well as the events leading to the &quot;pivotal&quot; Conjunction of the Spheres - in which a collision of different realms brought monsters into the world. 
Lauren S. Hissrich, showrunner on Netflix&#x27;s mainline Witcher series, will executive produce Blood Origin, and Declan de Barra - who penned The Witcher Season 1&#x27;s &quot;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials&quot; episode - will serve as writer and showrunner on the prequel.

                    <span>King of Fighters 15 is now also coming to Xbox Series X and S.
In a tweet, SNK confirmed the launch platforms for the upcoming fighting game, which was recently delayed to Q1 2022 due to production issues associated with rising cases of COVID-19 in Japan.
King of Fighters 15 is due out on PC via Windows 10, Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox Series X and S. Xbox One and Nintendo Switch are not on the list.

Setting a 20km target over four runs, Manchester United fan Jacob and his father created an Instagram account to help gain sponsorships and document the process.

                    <span>Surprise! Or not. Nintendo has at last unveiled its upgraded Switch model, which is due to launch on 8th October alongside Metroid Dread. It has a 7-inch OLED screen, 64GB of internal storage, a wide adjustable stand plus improved speakers.
There&#x27;s a new dock, too, with a wired LAN port.  White and neon red/blue colours will be available. Officially, it&#x27;s called the Nintendo Switch (OLED model) console. In the US it costs $350. In the UK, we&#x27;re yet to see local pricing.
We and others had expected Nintendo to push the button (flip the Switch?) and reveal its new model before E3. Nintendo really doesn&#x27;t like leaks! Anyway, on time or not, here we are:

Here are the patch notes for version 12.1.0:

The password generator included in Kaspersky Password Manager had several problems. The most critical one is that it used a PRNG not suited for cryptographic purposes. Its single source of entropy was the current time. All the passwords it created could be bruteforced in seconds. This article explains how to securely generate passwords, why Kaspersky Password Manager failed, and how to exploit this flaw.

                    <span>RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, has announced a second paid expansion, titled Ideology, which&#x27;ll be arriving in the next few weeks alongside a substantial free content update for all players.
Following on from last year&#x27;s Royalty DLC, Ideology aims to enhance RimWorld&#x27;s celebrated core by providing the tools needed to fashion a specific belief system for your colony. &quot;You can play as tree-worshipping cannibals who carve skulls into every piece of furniture,&quot; explains developer Tynan Sylvester on Steam, &quot;or blind tunnelers who shun the light, or transhumanists obsessed with perfecting the human form using exotic technology. Or be nudists, or drug-stupor mystics, or piratical raiders, or charity-focused givers, or pain-loving animal sacrificers, or dance-party techno ravers, or rustic ranching cowboys, or many many more.&quot;
Sylvester says it&#x27;ll be possible to mix and match different core elements of a colony&#x27;s belief system in Ideology, and that customisation can be taken even further if desired, with the expansion enabling players to individually adjust preferences in the following categories: precept, ritual, special social role, venerated animal and weapon, culture and style, unique building, tattoo, clothing, background narrative, god, and, perhaps most importantly of all, beard (more on those shortly!).

                    <span>Streaming service PlayStation Now offers a huge library of games for PlayStation users giving hundreds of PS4 titles to download and play instantly. 
The biggest and arguably best game coming this month is Red Dead Redemption 2, which follows the story of outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. It is full of shootouts, heists, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with NCPs, and maintaining Arthur&#x27;s honour through the choices you choose. The action-adventure game will be available on Tuesday, 6th June.
Judgment, from the same team that created the Yakuza series, is a spin off series that follows a detective investigating a string of murders. The game will be available for three months, from 6th June until the 4th October 2021.

                    <span>What&#x27;s the value of next-gen exclusive features? For Sony, it&#x27;s £9.
Last week Sony announced Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut, which is due out August on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
In doing so, Sony set the cat among the pigeons by putting a price on the various last-gen to current-gen upgrade paths.

                    <span>The next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series will not release anytime soon, according to reports. 
Grand Theft Auto 6 is still at least three or four years away, according to Battlefield insider Tom Henderson, who last week suggested GTA6 would not see a release until at least 2024 or 2025. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has now said he has heard similar.
The long wait, Henderson said, was due to a push within developer Rockstar to improve staff welfare and avoid the levels of crunch which have plagued the company over past releases. It is also, Henderson continued, because Rockstar wants to launch GTA6 at a time when the install base for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has grown considerably.

According to the story, the base previously hosted a &quot;thriving&quot; Pokémon Go community made up of troops, contractors and visiting civilians &quot;who played the game while exercising and after work&quot;.

                    <span>Ubisoft has pulled Might &amp; Magic 10 - Legacy from sale following a backlash to its server shutdown.
Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for the game - leaving some unable to access significant portions of its single-player content and its DLC.
And, as Emma reported last month, despite these issues, the game and its DLC were left on sale. No more.

                    <span>A new mod for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition has fixed the series&#x27; infamous save bug involving Conrad Verner - the infamous Shepard fan who loves to bug you.
The glitch caused Mass Effect 2 to incorrectly remember how you had treated Verner in Mass Effect 1, if you were nice to him. Catching up with Verner a second time, he would always react like you had put a gun in his face to get him to desist from acting like a trained N7 recruit for his own good. 
BioWare likely left this bug unpatched in the Legendary Edition as it later retconned Verner&#x27;s glitched response in Mass Effect 3, where Verner apologises if he had misremembered Shepard&#x27;s earlier actions.

                    <span>Final Fantasy 14 broke its Steam concurrent players record over the weekend.
Square Enix&#x27;s long-running MMO hit 47,542 concurrent players on Steam over the weekend, according to official stats provided by Valve&#x27;s platform.
That beats the game&#x27;s previous record of 41,200, set in June 2019 just ahead of the Shadowbringers expansion.

The image shows a group of stylish caped figures, who fans will recognise as the Antivan Crows (their sigil in the bottom right confirms this).
Antivan Crows have briefly popped up in the series before (Zevran was a Crow recruit way back in Dragon Age 1), as well as its spin-off comics and novels.

Log into Apex Legends on PC right now and instead of the usual playlists, you&#x27;ll get the URL &quot;savetitanfall.com&quot; with the subheader, &quot;[Titanfall 1] is being attacked so is Apex&quot;.
Players are also getting an &quot;important message&quot; at the end of each match that requests players &quot;visit and report savetitanfall.com&quot;, a website that&#x27;s been online since at least March 2021. Affected players are seemingly unable to access other game modes, essentially blocking them from playing at all.

                    <span>Sharkmob has updated the system requirements for its upcoming vampire-themed battle royale, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt.
Confirmation comes following a closed alpha beta test for the free-to-play game which ended earlier today.
While previously it was recommended players used a GTX 970 or RX 590, now Sharkmob suggests players use either a GTX 1070, RX 5600 XT or better for graphics,  and a SSD is &quot;strongly recommended&quot; even in the minimum spec. You&#x27;ll need around 20GB of storage, too.

                    <span>It looks like the next Dark Pictures instalment - the fourth part of Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures Anthology - will be called The Devil in Me. 
While not formally revealed by the developer, the information has seemingly been leaked by a trademark filing with Justia Trademarks. The new logo - which looks in keeping with past ones from the anthology - was filed on 1st July, 2021.
As described by the trademark organisation itself, The mark consists of the word &quot;THE on top of the words DARK PICTURES, stacked on top of the words THE DEVIL IN ME&quot;.

                    <span>Dead By Daylight has hit a new record of over 100,000 concurrent players on PC during its fifth anniversary celebrations.
The new record - which coincided with a 40 per cent off Steam sale and the recent release of a bunch of Resident Evil-themed goodies, including new skins and a new killer - saw 105,093 players jump on Steam at the same time, according to SteamDB.
The milestone also comes at the same time the asymmetric horror game, developed by Behaviour Interactive, is running an time-limited event from now until 15th July, during which there&#x27;s a load of new content up for grabs, including anniversary crowns, community challenges, and enough Iridescent Shards for all players to purchase an &quot;entire original character&quot; of their choice.

                    <span>A sealed, rare variant of Nintendo&#x27;s 1987 classic The Legend of Zelda is currently for sale via auction. At the time of writing, with five days left to go on the auction, the lot has a current bid of $110,000 (£72,300).
This lot, called a &quot;NES R&quot; variant, is particularly significant because this version was &quot;only produced for a few months in late 1987&quot;. Rev-A replaced it in early 1988.
The only version considered more valuable than this one is a &quot;NES TM&quot;, and there&#x27;s reportedly only one sealed copy in existence &quot;and there is no telling whether or not that copy will ever come to market&quot;. Therefore, this cartridge is likely &quot;the earliest sealed copy one could realistically hope to obtain&quot; and sits at a grading - or wata rating - of 9.

                    <span>Nightdive Studios has published seven minutes of gameplay of its System Shock remake.
The System Shock video, below, includes plenty of skulking about in the Research level of Citadel Station.
I think it looks pretty impressive - the visuals are appropriately atmospheric, with plenty of sparky visual effects. There&#x27;s a sense of foreboding, which System Shock should have. We see enemies who lurch towards the player once they&#x27;re disturbed. The video ends with a quite terrifying fight against a large robot who takes an age to go down.

                    <span>Guild Wars 2 developer ArenaNet has issued an update on the studio and its long-running MMO.
The headline announcement is the End of Dragons expansion has been delayed from late 2021 to early 2022. In a post on the Guild Wars 2 website, ArenaNet director John Taylor explained the delay:
&quot;As expansion development has progressed and the real-world challenges of the past year and a half have changed the way we live and work, it&#x27;s become clear that we need a little more time to deliver our creative vision for Cantha. As a result, we&#x27;re delaying the release of Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons from late 2021 to early 2022.

                    <span>A Guilty Gear Strive patch stealth removed reference to Uyghur, Tibet and Taiwan in a China-related lore entry.
The change was highlighted on the ResetEra forum on 21st June after it bubbled up on Strive&#x27;s Steam forum following a patch issued on 18th June that brought Strive up to v1.03.
Neither Guilty Gear Strive publisher Bandai Namco or developer Arc System Works have commented, despite repeated requests from Eurogamer after the change emerged.

In a statement published to Twitter, Faze said it had &quot;removed&quot; Frazier Kay from its clan, and suspended Jarvis Khattri, Nikan Nadim and Teeqo until further notice.
These influencers, each with millions of YouTube subscribers and social media followers, were heavily criticised for promoting a cryptocurrency token called Save the Kids whose value plummeted soon after it launched.

                    <span>Dark Alliance got its first big update today - and its patch notes are frustratingly vague.
The Dungeons &amp; Dragons action role-playing game launched on 22nd June and was met with a mixed reception, so there are a lot of eyeballs on this first patch to see if it remedies some of the game&#x27;s more immediate issues.
Unfortunately, developer Tuque Games&#x27; patch notes for Dark Alliance v1.16 are so vague, players are struggling to work out what the update actually does.

The studio will now focus on its next project, it said in a tweet.
The confirmation comes as no surprise to Mortal Kombat fans - the fighting game last saw new DLC characters in November last year, when Kombat Pack 2 added John Rambo, Mileena and Rain to the fighting game.

                    <span>Doom Eternal will no longer receive its previously announced PvP-focussed Invasions mode, with id Software having made the decision to pivot development toward a new single-player horde mode instead, due to coronavirus-related development challenges.
Invasions Mode, announced back at QuakeCon 2018, was intended to deliver a vaguely Dark-Souls-esque multiplayer spin on Doom Eternal&#x27;s single-player campaign, enabling other humans to manifest as demons throughout the story and do battle with the host player for some added challenge.
Well over 12 months after Doom Eternal&#x27;s March 2020 launch, however, Invasions Mode is still yet to materialise, leaving fans to ponder its fate. And now, in a newly released statement, id Software executive producer Marty Stratton has provided an answer, confirming Invasions Mode is officially dead due to the impact &quot;the unforeseen consequences of the pandemic and remote working&quot; have had on development.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, the second game in Capcom&#x27;s RPG spin-off series, comes to Switch and PC next Friday, 9th July, and, much like its mainline sibling, will enjoy a healthy dose of post-launch support. And now, with its arrival in sight, Capcom has shared a roadmap outlining those post-release content plans.
One week after Monster Hunter Stories 2&#x27;s launch, Capcom will deploy its first (and previously detailed) post-launch update, introducing introducing Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s dog-like Palamute companion as a rideable Monstie.
That&#x27;ll be followed by a second update on 5th August introducing Hellblade Glavenus and Boltreaver Astalos as new Monsties, alongside a new co-op quest - featuring the gilded Elder Dragon Kulve Taroth - that Monster Riders can tackle together. Capcom notes that while the Elder Dragon won&#x27;t be rideable, materials gained from the quest can be used to craft &quot;powerful&quot; new equipment.

                    <span>Nexus Mods has announced that mod authors will soon be unable to delete mod files from the website, a change being made ahead of the introduction of its new collections system. 
The news was announced via a blog post, where the company explained that the change was necessary for the implementation of its collections system. From now on, mod files will be archived instead of deleted, which will make them &quot;inaccessible unless directly requested eg. via the API.&quot;
&quot;It is our core belief that making modding easier is a noble goal, so more people can enjoy our joint hobby,&quot; Nexus Mods said. &quot;We are convinced that our collections system, a project we have spent almost two years and many work-hours on, is the way to achieve this goal.&quot;

                    <span>Humble Bundle faced criticism earlier this year when it tried to remove charity sliders from its bundle pages, a decision that would have severely limited the amount players could donate to charity for their purchases. Following significant backlash, Humble Bundle decided to reverse this decision and reinstate the sliders - but it&#x27;s once again placing limits on how much can be donated to charity. 
In a blog post, Humble Bundle announced it will be rolling out a &quot;new iteration&quot; of sliders in mid-July. &quot;While splits on each bundle will vary, on average there will be a minimum amount for Humble Bundle between 15-30 percent,&quot; the post said. This means users will no longer be able to donate the entire amount to charity, although the company said there will continue to be some &quot;100 percent to charity bundles&quot;. 
The company explained that the &quot;PC storefront landscape has changed significantly&quot; since the bundles began in 2010, and it had to &quot;continue to evolve with it to stay on mission.

CD Projekt first announced Monster Slayer in August last year, and said that its mobile studio Spokko was on development duties. It promised &quot;rich, story-driven quests&quot; and first-person monster battles impacted by your local time of day and weather. So, rain.

Venturebeat - which first reported on potential plans for a deal between the two back in April - say discussions have now progressed to the stage that a letter of intent has been signed while legal teams hash out the finer details. 
This leaves development work to continue (and Xbox boss Phil Spencer to continue displaying a Kojima Productions figurine on his shelf) in the meantime.

The new expansion, titled Legacy of the Sith, was announced in a livestream last night. It&#x27;s due to add a mixture of additional story content, player rewards and new gameplay features.  
&quot;The war between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire spreads to new worlds,&quot; the announcement post explains. &quot;Dangerous fringe groups rise in the dark corners of the galaxy ​and Darth Malgus pursues an unknown plan...

                    <span>Digital PSP games will continue to be sold via the PlayStation 3 and Vita even after today&#x27;s PSP store shutdown.
PlayStation confirmed the situation in an update to its support page for discontinued apps and services this week, first noticed by ResetEra, and then confirmed by Kotaku.
So, while the PSP will still lose its purchasing functionality as planned, PSP games will still be available to play - a key concern among fans worried over Sony&#x27;s perceived lack of care for game preservation.

                    <span>One of the many highlights of Satoru Iwata&#x27;s reign at Nintendo was his series of Iwata Asks interviews - intimate, insightful and always entertaining chats between the president and the developers that started in the Wii era and carried on until Iwata&#x27;s untimely death in 2015, they&#x27;re some of the finest pieces of games journalism online. 
After an understandable hiatus, Nintendo has introduced a new similarly-themed series simply called &#x27;Ask the Developer&#x27;, with the first installment focussing on the recently released Game Builder Garage. It&#x27;s a gentle, informative and enlightening read, even if it&#x27;s short on any major revelations (although it&#x27;s opened my eyes to the stylish lab coats all Nintendo developers seem to wear at the moment). 
The interview comes as Game Builder Garage gets a free demo on Nintendo Switch, with the first of its seven lessons now available to download from the eShop.

                    <span>Mario Kart Live Home Circuit, the curious and enjoyable AR-offshoot for Nintendo&#x27;s much-loved racing series that first released in October last year, has just got a substantial new update that introduces a whole new cup and various other elements. 
The 1.1.0 update, which went live yesterday, introduces the all-new Mario Cup, and upon its completion you&#x27;re given access to new environments and gates to use in your course creations. There&#x27;s also new kart elements, with &#x27;Super Yoshi&#x27; and &#x27;Yoshi Horn&#x27; up for grabs. 
Mario Kart Live Home Circuit was the work of Velan Studios, who&#x27;ve gone on to find further success with this year&#x27;s Knockout City. Home Circuit wasn&#x27;t without its limitations, but it was still a fascinating and frequently charming thing.  &quot;A neatly crafted gizmo, and a fresh reminder that Nintendo remains a toymaker at heart,&quot; we wrote in our Mario Kart Live Home Circuit review.

                    <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator is gorgeous but notoriously demanding of PC hardware; however, developer Asobo says it&#x27;ll be getting a whole lot less demanding when its next Sim Update arrives alongside the game&#x27;s highly anticipated Xbox Series X/S release on 27th July.
Asobo offered a look the huge performance improvements coming to Microsoft Flight Simulator on PC during its latest developer livestream, with CEO Sebastian Wloch explaining the team has rewritten &quot;a lot of the parts of the engine...in order to get the maximum performance out of the sim&quot;, as part of its work on the upcoming console version.
To illustrate just how effective Asobo&#x27;s engine tweaks have been, Wloch demoed a before-and-after gameplay video featuring a flyover of Manhattan, captured from a PC equipped with an i7-9700K CPU and Nvidia 2060 Super graphics card - and running Flight Simulator at Ultra settings in 4K with a 40% render scale (jump to the 8-minute mark below to see the footage).

                    <span>What better way to enjoy the summer months than an escape to the countryside for some idyllic cottage living? And what better way to do it without the inconvenience of ever actually having to leave your house than with the Sim&#x27;s 4&#x27;s latest expansion?
The Sims 4: Cottage Living, which arrives on 22nd July, is the tenth full-scale Expansion Pack (and 42nd bit of paid DLC) to launch for life sim since its release in 2014, and - as its name very much implies - is all about cosy cottages and rustic charm.
Unsurprisingly, top of the list of features coming in Cottage Living is the ability to settle down in a charmingly rustic new abode. Here, players can befriend the likes of wild rabbits, foxes, and birds, while also raising their own animals - including llamas, chickens, and cows for wool, eggs, and milk respectively - in order to start their journey to self-sufficiency.

                    <span>Having spent some time percolating in the rumour pool (and occasionally leaking onto various ratings boards around the world), developer Sucker Punch&#x27;s &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; of its acclaimed open-world stealth-action game Ghost of Tsushima is now official, and coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 20th August.
Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut, as the new edition is formally known, features all the content from the original release, alongside a new chapter in protagonist Jin&#x27;s story, which will see him travel to Tsushima&#x27;s neighbouring island of Iki.
&quot;In this new story,&quot; Sucker Punch explains on the PlayStation Blog, &quot;Jin travels to the island to investigate rumours of a Mongol presence. But soon, he finds himself caught up in events with deeply personal stakes that will force him to relive some traumatic moments from his past.&quot;

                    <span>It&#x27;s no secret that Team Fortress 2 has a bit of a bot problem, but the game also has a community that really enjoys mid-match shenanigans - and the two combined today in one of the funniest posts about TF2 bots I&#x27;ve seen so far. 
Reddit user 2Noel posted footage of an Attack/Defend match in which Blu team was pitted against a bunch of bots - normally not great news for those wanting to keep their heads on their shoulders. Yet the team decided to try a different tactic to just charging into battle, instead choosing to conga their way out of spawn and onto the control points. And surprisingly, it worked. Stay tuned for the satisfying bot slaughter at the end of the match:  
The question you&#x27;re probably asking right now is: why didn&#x27;t the bots shoot the Blu team members? The answer, it seems, is that the bots are programmed to avoid shooting players who are using taunts and emotes. If you look closely at the video, you&#x27;ll notice that players not engaged in the conga line (such as poor old atomdotdat) are instantly sniped by the bots, while the dancers remain unharmed.

                    <span>Norse god and Disney+ star Loki is now available in Fortnite, resplendent in his original Avengers movie outfit. Sign up to the game&#x27;s £10 Fortnite Crew subscription in June and you&#x27;ll get Loki for yourself, horns and all. 
But it is those horns which are causing a problem for some fans, who have said the mischievous god&#x27;s headpiece simply blocks too much of their view.
I&#x27;ve played a few games now as Loki and haven&#x27;t seen as much of an issue as the images being shared on reddit, such as the one below. I think this is probably angled to make the problem look as bad as possible, although yes, Loki&#x27;s enormous helmet is certainly quite distracting.

                    <span>Good news for anyone particularly attached to their Valheim buildings, as developer Iron Gate has tweaked the AI to make monsters slightly less keen on smashing up structures. 
Iron Gate recently made a change to enemy AI that made monsters much more aggressive towards buildings, and players started to complain the monsters had become a bit too rowdy. Enemies were seen running past players to destroy their buildings instead, while some monsters became so confused about what they should be attacking that they essentially froze in place. I checked the patch out for myself and discovered local greydwarfs had stripped our village walls of decorations, while a run-in with a troll ended in disaster when it became a bit too interested in my friend&#x27;s treehouse:
In any case, it seems Iron Gate noticed the AI change was causing a fair bit of chaos, and the AI has been tweaked once again to solve the problems.

                    <span>Sony has announced that Nixxes will join its growing family of PlayStation Studios.
The Netherlands-based Nixxes has a track record of working on the PC and console versions of multiplatform projects, and in recent years has worked with Square Enix on Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and the Tomb Raider franchise. 
PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst announced the acquisition this afternoon, just two days after the confirmation that Sony had also snapped up Returnal studio Housemarque. Exactly how much Nixxes cost is being kept confidential.

                    <span>The project, named Mass Effect: Corsair, would have been a first-person space adventure where you piloted a ship around the galaxy&#x27;s lawless regions.
Details have come to light now from former BioWare veteran Mark Darrah, as part of a MinnMax interview (thanks IGN).

                    <span>As ransomware becomes more common, I’m seeing more discussions about the ethics of paying the ransom. Here’s one more contribution to that issue: a research paper that the insurance industry is hurting more than it’s helping.
However, the most pressing challenge currently facing the industry is ransomware. Although it is a societal problem, cyber insurers have received considerable criticism for facilitating ransom payments to cybercriminals. These add fuel to the fire by incentivising cybercriminals’ engagement in ransomware operations and enabling existing operators to invest in and expand their capabilities. Growing losses from ransomware attacks have also emphasised that the current reality is not sustainable for insurers either...</span>
