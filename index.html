                    <span>I suggest that serverless computing, or “serverless” has hype that at this point has outpaced what the technology / philosophy / religion has been promising. Serverless computing arrived (debatably; please do not email me about this whatever you do, fans of Google App Engine / CGI scripts / managed SaaS offerings / pedants) with something […]

                    <span>I just don’t think it’s possible to create a hack-proof computer system, especially when the system is physically in the hands of the hackers. The Sony Playstation 5 is the latest example:
Hackers may have just made some big strides towards possibly jailbreaking the PlayStation 5 over the weekend, with the hacking group Fail0verflow claiming to have managed to obtain PS5 root keys allowing them to decrypt the console’s firmware.

The two exploits are particularly notable due to the level of access they theoretically give to the PS5’s software.

Instead, this post aims to raise awareness of the issue and to highlight important device use-cases too. This is needed as Kubernetes works on new related features such as support for user namespaces.

                    <span>As one of Bethesda&#x27;s biggest and most beloved series, it&#x27;s not much of a revelation to hear the company is already mulling over a new Fallout instalment, but studio director Todd Howard has now talked a little about a potential new series entry, confirming that while an idea exists, Fallout 5 is still a long way off.
Speaking to IGN as part of a Skyrim 10th anniversary retrospective, Howard explained that currently the studio has a &quot;one-pager&quot; for Fallout 5, outlining what it wants to do with the series. However, sci-fi adventure Starfield, due to release next year, and The Elder Scrolls 6 - which was still in its design phase as of June this year - remain the studio&#x27;s priority, meaning it could be years before work on the next Fallout begins in earnest.

The 2021 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 4 of which were up for election in 2021. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.
This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Results
Congratulations to the elected committee members whose two year terms begin immediately (listed in alphabetical order by GitHub handle):

                    <span>Developer Turtle Rock has released a fresh post-launch content roadmap for its well-received co-op zombie shooter Back 4 Blood, promising a host of new features into 2022, including a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression before this year is through.
Back 4 Blood, you might recall, came in for criticism on release when players discovered its unwavering always-online requirements, even when playing solo with AI teammates. Worse, restrictions to solo mode meant players wishing to go it alone were prevented from earning progress towards Accomplishments, earning Supply Points, and even tracking stats. Following player feedback, Turtle Rock wrote, &quot;We have heard your frustrations about progression in solo mode and are discussing ways to address the issue&quot;.

                    <span>Pokémon Smile, the augmented reality smartphone app designed to encourage children to brush their teeth, has just received its first ever content update, almost 18 months after its initial launch back in June last year.
Pokémon Smile, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tasks users with rescuing Pokémon from &quot;cavity causing bacteria&quot; - by brushing their actual teeth with an actual brush - all while wearing a special AR hat. Any Pokémon saved from calamity are popped in a Pokédex, and there&#x27;s a photo and sticker element for those really into the whole thing.

As revealed at QuakeCon back in August, Skyrim&#x27;s Anniversary Edition bundles together 2016&#x27;s Skyrim: Special Edition and all Creation Club content released at the time of the Anniversary Edition&#x27;s launch - amounting to over 500 elements, including quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and spells. Creation Club, for those unfamiliar, is the name given to Bethesda&#x27;s curated pool of officially sanctioned mods, with each item available for purchase using premium currency Credits in the Special Edition.

                    <span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has finally been given a long-awaited - and desperately needed - shot in the arm, courtesy of Nintendo&#x27;s 2.0 update which, somewhat unexpectedly, arrived earlier today. We already knew it was going to be a big one, of course, but we now have a much clearer idea of just how big it actually is, with data miners having successfully unearthed and catalogued a whopping 9,000+ new items as part of the update.
Granted, a fair few of those items - as datamined by NWPlayer123, Trundler, and VillagerDB, and shared by AnimalCrossingWorld - are colour variations, but even taking those into account, it&#x27;s still a mammoth set of additions, covering clothing items, furniture, a multitude of different light fixtures, cooking apparatus, and more.

The Jinx crossover gets underway today, and - as is now very much the norm in the ever-revolving advertising billboard that is Fortnite&#x27;s Metaversal world - will take the form of a purchasable skin in the shooter&#x27;s Item Shop.

                    <span>Almost exactly 15 months after it was revealed Spider-Man would be heading to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers as a PlayStation-exclusive playable character, developer Crystal Dynamics has announced a release date for the much-delayed hero; he&#x27;ll be swinging into action on 30th November as part of a relatively beefy update for the beleaguered live service game.
Spider-Man was originally due to arrive &quot;early&quot; 2021, but players began to wonder if something was seriously amiss when the character, having failed to materialise in that initial launch window, was conspicuously absent from a development roadmap stretching all the way into &quot;summer and beyond&quot;. Crystal Dynamics eventually moved to reassure fans that Spidey was still coming but his exact arrival date remained unclear - until now.

                    <span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has officially surpassed Mario Kart Wii in overall sales, making the Switch port obviously the best Mario Kart ever made (sorry, I don&#x27;t make the rules). 
In its latest financial report, Nintendo announced it had shifted 3.34m copies of the game over the past two quarters, meaning it has sold more than 38.74m copies to date. In contrast, Mario Kart Wii had 37.38m sales in its lifetime.

                    <span>The next major project from Mafia 3 studio Hangar 13 has been canned, despite $53m having been spent on its development since 2017.
The unannounced game, known internally as Volt, was set to be a three-player co-operative live service game to rival Destiny. The game&#x27;s name was apparently short for Voltron, and one key mechanic would have seen enemies fusing together.

                    <span>The Israeli cyberweapons arms manufacturer — and human rights violator, and probably war criminal — NSO Group has been added to the US Department of Commerce’s trade blacklist. US companies and individuals cannot sell to them. Aside from the obvious difficulties this causes, it’ll make it harder for them to buy zero-day vulnerabilities on the open market.
This is another step in the ongoing US actions against the company.</span>

EA&#x27;s newly announced offer runs alongside a similar early access event for EA Play Pro subscribers and anyone that&#x27;s pre-ordered the Gold or Ultimate editions of Battlefield 2042. However, while both those group will have access the game for an entire week ahead of its 19th November launch, early access will be capped at a total of ten hours across the week for those joining in via EA Play and Game Pass.

                    <span>Blizzard&#x27;s monthly active user count has dropped again, the embattled company admitted last night, during its latest quarterly results. 
The developer&#x27;s monthly active users (MAUs) total was down 13 percent year-on-year, to 26 million players. That&#x27;s despite the recent launch of Diablo 2: Resurrected in September. Indeed, that figure means Blizzard has overall shed a million active users since May, and three million total since the quarter before that, when it was at 29 million.

                    <span>Another day, another sign of more bits and pieces on the way to Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. This time, its a fresh pair of PlayStation trophies which point to new in-game tombs to explore.

Oneal, formerly the boss of Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy studio Vicarious Visions, was hired as Blizzard co-leader alongside Mike Ybarra following the departure of Blizzard president J. Allen Brack - who left amid the fallout from the State of California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, discrimination, and a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture at the company.

A Harvard spokesperson said that the university is working to crack down on the fake students and other scammers that have gained access to its site.

Netflix announced it was &quot;in the early stages&quot; of expanding into games back in July, explaining it would initially focus on titles for mobile devices. Two such games - Stranger Things: 1984 and Stranger Things 3 - were added to its entertainment library in August as part of an early Poland-exclusive test, and  three more - Shooting Hoops, Teeter (Up), and Card Blast - were introduced during a wider test in September.

Wizards Unite arrived with much fanfare back June 2019, presenting a more narrative-focused take on the hugely popular location-based AR action of Pokémon Go as Harry Potter seeped into the real-world. And now, nearly two and a half years on, that adventure is almost at an end.

Awesome Games Done Quick 2022 takes place from 9th-16th January next year and will span more than 170 speedruns, all raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation and covering the usual mix of triple-A titles, smaller-scale indie offerings, retro classics, and oddities.

                    <span>Earlier this year, developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone surprised fans with news that Stardew Valley was making the jump to the tabletop with an official board game adaptation. Unfortunately, the first batch went fast - but those that missed out on the initial run now have a second chance at acquiring the game, with orders re-opening this Wednesday.
Alas, online orders will once again only be available for shipping within the US. However, Barone says he&#x27;s teamed up with number of distributors in the UK, the EU, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand this time around, and that copies will be available directly from local stores in these regions. &quot;It&#x27;s not possible for us to keep track of which stores specifically,&quot; he adds, &quot;so the best way is to contact your local store and ask if they are carrying copies.

                    <span>As the calendar flips from October to November, and you pop that sexy calculator costume back in the cupboard for another year, Sony arrives with a fresh batch of PlayStation Now titles, which this month include Mafia: Definitive Edition, Celeste, and Final Fantasy 9.
Last year&#x27;s Mafia: Definitive Edition is, of course, the fancied up version of Illusion Softworks&#x27; fondly remembered open-world mobster game from 2002. This new version certainly looks the part, reimagining the 1930s city of Lost Heaven for modern hardware, but Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell didn&#x27;t feel the the tweaks to its ageing gameplay were quite so successful.

                    <span>Stars of Blood, a long-lost space pirate game once in the works at Valve, has been glimpsed in newly-surfaced concept art. 
The game&#x27;s existance was acknowledged by Valve boss Gabe Newell during an interview in 2012, although the project had already been canned by that point.

                    <span>Really interesting research demonstrating how to hide vulnerabilities in source code by manipulating how Unicode text is displayed. It’s really clever, and not the sort of attack one would normally think about.
From Ross Anderson’s blog:
We have discovered ways of manipulating the encoding of source code files so that human viewers and compilers see different logic. One particularly pernicious method uses Unicode directionality override characters to display code as an anagram of its true logic. We’ve verified that this attack works against C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python, and suspect that it will work against most other modern languages...</span>

Despite hitting an impressive all-time concurrent peak of just shy of a million players on 3rd October, Forbes spotted that the numbers on SteamCharts have taken something of a dip, with its concurrent rate falling around 135,000 players every week since launch.

A report by Kotaku states that Friday, 29th October 2021, was the last operating day for employees in Nintendo&#x27;s Redwood City location, one of three main Nintendo offices for Nintendo of America. Around 100 employees are thought to be affected by the closure in California, although it&#x27;s unclear how many staff at the Canadian office have been forced to relocate or lose their jobs.

                    <span>id Software is currently advertising a dozen job openings at its Texas studio, sparking speculation that a new Quake instalment might be on the way.
Let&#x27;s face it - a development studio advertising for developers isn&#x27;t particularly newsworthy. In this instance, however, Zenimax stated several times that the new hires will be contributing to &quot;the development of a long-running iconic action FPS&quot;, and makes mention of &quot;sci-fi and fantasy environments&quot; - and that&#x27;s the bit that&#x27;s got everyone a little excited.

Moving Out, for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, will be available to download as part of next month&#x27;s Xbox Games With Gold offerings from 1st-30th November. Developed by SMG Studio and DevM Games, it&#x27;s a raucous, physics-based moving simulator, in which friends team up for some knockabout furniture-shifting action across increasingly hazardous environs.

                    <span>Amy Hennig and Skydance Media are working on a new &quot;narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure&quot; set in the Marvel universe.
Hennig, perhaps best known for her work as head writer and creative director on Naughty Dog&#x27;s first three Uncharted games, joined Skydance back in 2019. Prior to that, she was working on a highly-anticipated Star Wars title in conjunction with Visceral Games - a long-in-development project which was ultimately cancelled by EA.

                    <span>Cyberpunk 2077 is nearing its one year anniversary, and it&#x27;s probably fair to say the last 12 months haven&#x27;t gone quite as CD Projekt was hoping. One year on, the developer is still struggling to right ship - and save face - following the game&#x27;s disastrous launch, and a newly revised roadmap for those remedial efforts has now seen all Cyberpunk 2077 updates and DLC formally pushed into 2022.
While CD Projeckt&#x27;s development roadmap for Cyberpunk 2077 has never been overly fond of specifics, the studio began 2021 by announcing its troubled RPG would receive &quot;multiple updates and improvements&quot; - including free DLC and the game&#x27;s long-awaited enhanced edition for next-gen consoles, throughout this year.

                    <span>Twitch has now launched the test of its paid boost feature, but streamers aren&#x27;t impressed.

Specifically, Kotick has said he will only accept California&#x27;s legal minimum salary of $62,500, and will not take any other bonuses or compensation. However, it&#x27;s worth remembering the CEO already earned $155m from the company via a bonus awarded earlier this year.

Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers. We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers. We began observing this latest campaign in May 2021 and have been notifying impacted partners and customers while also developing new technical assistance and guidance for the reseller community. Since May, we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers that have been targeted by Nobelium. We continue to investigate, but to date we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been compromised. Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful...</span>

                    <span>Intel unveiled its 12th-gen processors today, shedding light on what promises to be the company&#x27;s biggest step forward in on the desktop for years. These are finally 10nm parts - after seven brutal years and multiple 14nm iterations - and they also adopt a radically different hybrid design, with a combination of low-power &#x27;Efficient&#x27; cores and high-power multi-threaded &#x27;Performance&#x27; cores.
The top chip, the Core i9 12900K, includes eight of each type, for 16 cores and 24 threads in total, and promises to offer boosts of up to 30 percent depending on workload. For gaming, Intel is projecting gains of up to 20 percent, again depending on the game - and with the potential for more to come as games are optimised for the unique arrangement. These chips should also multi-task better, with the more efficient E cores taking on background tasks like streaming or virus scans while the P cores handle gaming or content creation. The new CPUs will arrive on November 4th, so we don&#x27;t have long to wait!

Tonight kicked off with a bizarre-looking TV gameshow murder-&#x27;em-up, like Squid Game meets The Prisoner. You can forge weapons, play with melee or guns. It&#x27;s called DeathVerse and it&#x27;s coming in spring 2022 to PS4 and PS5.

                    <span>Death&#x27;s Door, the celebrated action-adventure from Titan Souls&#x27; developer Acid Nerve, will be making its way to PlayStation 4, PS5, and Switch on 23rd November.
Death&#x27;s Door debuted on PC and Xbox earlier this year, immediately garnering acclaim for its richly atmospheric blend of ingenious exploratory puzzling and challenging combat - all wrapped up in a wondrous, melancholy tale of a soul-reaping crow on a quest to fix a devastating mistake in a beautifully bleak world.

                    <span>Earlier this week, reports began circulating that Warner Bros is working on a Smash-Bros-style crossover fighter - and now a leaked first image and fresh details have appeared online.
Word of the project - said to include the likes of Scooby Doo&#x27;s Shaggy, Lord of the Rings&#x27; Gandalf, Tom &amp; Jerry, Fred Flintstone, Mad Max, and Johnny Bravo as playable fighters - initially surfaced on Reddit, but was subsequently verified by GamesBeat&#x27;s Jeff Grubb.

                    <span>Superliminal, the acclaimed perspective puzzler from developer Pillow Castle, is introducing an &quot;experimental&quot; battle-royale-style multiplayer mode in a free update on Steam next week.
In its original, single-player-only guise, Superliminal took players on a brain-flexing first-person journey through the SomnaSculpt dream therapy programme, in which the environment - and objects within it - could gain hitherto unseen properties by manipulating perspective.

                    <span>Another batch of PlayStation Plus games has leaked online ahead of Sony&#x27;s official reveal - promisingly, from the same source that got it right twice before - with Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning, Knockout City, The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, and First Class Trouble all reportedly coming to the subscription service in November.
News of next month&#x27;s PlayStation Plus games comes via user Billbill-Kun on French forum Dealabs (as spotted by VGC), who accurately leaked the subscription service&#x27;s additions for September and October. As such, it seems reasonably safe to trust in the freshly leaked November line-up too.

The Operation Motherland update, due out 2nd November, revolves around the new Conquest mode, which is described as an alternative mode to Ghost Recon Breakpoint&#x27;s story mode. Here&#x27;s the setup:

                    <span>Microsoft has explained why it created a &quot;Min Spec Mode&quot; for Age of Empires 4.

                    <span>Some Pokémon Unite players have been annoyed at a little quirk in the game: you can&#x27;t see the scoreboard.
For such a competitive game, that may seem like an oversight. However, it&#x27;s been done on purpose.

Maple Lodge Campsite is Phasmophobia&#x27;s first outdoor map and packs in everything you could possibly hope for in a spooky holiday retreat, including picnic areas, tents, a log cabin, and even a haunted lake. Developer Kinetic Games says the new map features &quot;more unique objects, higher object density and more visual detail&quot;, and that players can expect other maps to receive a similar boost in detail, plus more unique objects, at a later date.

Activision Blizzard moved to pause legal proceedings following a messy tussle between California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), which had launched the original lawsuit against the publisher, and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) - which had previously announced an $18m settlement deal with Activision as part of its own investigation into the company.

                    <span>Citizen Lab is reporting that a New York Times journalist was hacked with the NSO Group’s spyware Pegasus, probably by the Saudis.
The world needs to do something about these cyberweapons arms manufacturers. This kind of thing isn’t enough; NSO Group is an Israeli company.</span>

                    <span>Activision Blizzard is letting every Battle.net user change their name for free.
The change comes in the wake of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s committment to changing its &quot;frat boy&quot; culture following California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit. Following accusations of sexual harassment against the developer the character is named after, Overwatch&#x27;s fan-favourite cowboy character Jesse McCree has been given a new name and will be known as Cole Cassidy when an update rolls out on Tuesday, 26th October. Consequently, Activision Blizzard is extending the opportunity of a name-change to its players, too.

Though barely a minute long, the new teaser shows off a decidedly less supernatural premise. &quot;You wanna know what it means to be a killer?&quot; an off-camera narrator muses, before we&#x27;re subjected to a raft of bloody images - a syringe, a beating heart, a bloody smear on a tiled wall - and what looks to be an assortment of DIY surgical experiments. Ew.

                    <span>Overwatch&#x27;s fan-favourite cowboy character Jesse McCree finally has a new name after Activision Blizzard committed to changing it in the wake of California&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture at the company. Henceforth, Jesse McCree will be known as Cole Cassidy.
McCree is just one of many characters across Blizzard&#x27;s portfolio to have taken his name from a developer at the company. However, back in August, Blizzard announced it would be renaming the cowboy after the real-life Jesse McCree, who had been named in several accounts of the studio&#x27;s toxic work culture, was confirmed to have departed the company amid the fallout from the lawsuit - although no reason for his exit was given.

Maine’s shrimp fishery has been closed for nearly a decade since the stock’s collapse in 2013. Scientists are now saying a species of squid that came into the Gulf of Maine during a historic ocean heatwave the year before may have been a “major player” in the shrimp’s downturn.

                    <span>Someone has been hacking telecommunications networks around the world:
LightBasin (aka UNC1945) is an activity cluster that has been consistently targeting the telecommunications sector at a global scale since at least 2016, leveraging custom tools and an in-depth knowledge of telecommunications network architectures.
Recent findings highlight this cluster’s extensive knowledge of telecommunications protocols, including the emulation of these protocols to facilitate command and control (C2) and utilizing scanning/packet-capture tools to retrieve highly specific information from mobile communication infrastructure, such as subscriber information and call metadata.

First up, there&#x27;s a phantom car on the loose that appears out of nowhere to kill players. Here&#x27;s a clip of a poor soul getting attacked.

                    <span>343 Industries has released a new video showing off the team&#x27;s effort to make the PC version of Halo Infinite the best it could possibly be.
The video has a roll-call of every type of PC-specific feature you could imagine while emphasising that the PC build isn&#x27;t just a port of the Xbox version of the game.

                    <span>Nvidia has announced a raft of upgrades for its GeForce Now cloud streaming service with a new premium tier offering RTX 3080 class graphics performance, allowing for 1440p120 gameplay across a range of platforms and 4K60 HDR, limited for now to Shield Android TV devices. New latency reductions techniques are also promised, with Nvidia making bold claims about input lag up against competing cloud technologies - and even local devices.
All of this is made possible via brand new class of server blade Nvidia is bringing online, dubbed the &#x27;SuperPod&#x27;. While you&#x27;re not getting to an actual RTX 3080 as such, you are getting equivalent enterprise-class hardware based on the same GA-102 silicon, backed up by an eight-core, 16 thread AMD Threadripper processor working in combination with ultra-fast PCIe Gen 4.0 solid-state storage and an impressive 28GB of 3200MHz DDR4 memory. This gives the SuperPod top-class graphics performance (only an RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3090 are faster in the Nvidia stack), though CPU performance would fall a little short of the latest Ryzen 5000 and Intel CPUs.

                    <span>Volition&#x27;s first reveal of its upcoming Saints Row reboot did not, it&#x27;s fair to say, seem to bare much in common with the series of old. A few gameplay snippets that followed helped bridge the divide, but a newly revealed look at some early missions has given the clearest indication yet of how Volition is looking to revitalise its ageing sandbox series.
As shared by GameInformer, the new nine-minute pre-alpha gameplay video offers a look at two early story missions: Making Rent and Idol Threat. The first of these takes place before the Saints are even officially formed, with The Boss and the game&#x27;s core supporting - Kevin, Neenah, and Eli, all previously members of rival gangs - orchestrating a robbery on a loan office to raise some cash.

The first time I heard of this issue was from a Midwest CEO. His organization had been hit by ransomware to the tune of $10M. Operationally, they were still recovering nearly a year later. And, embarrassingly, it was his most trusted VP who let the attackers in. It turns out that the VP had approved over 10 different push-based messages for logins that he was not involved in. When the VP was asked why he approved logins for logins he was not actually doing, his response was, “They (IT) told me that I needed to click on Approve when the message appeared!”...</span>

The freshly leaked trailer - which has surfaced online ahead of a rumoured official reveal tomorrow, 21st October - has been popping up across the internet throughout the day, with Sony&#x27;s lawyers fighting a losing battle of whack-a-mole in a bid to take it down.

Instead, I’m going to apply its consumer tax product to how I think about AWS bill savings. For readers who aren’t in the United States or familiar with the way […]

                    <span>Here’s a story of someone who, with three compatriots, rented textbooks from Amazon and then sold them instead of returning them. They used gift cards and prepaid credit cards to buy the books, so there was no available balance when Amazon tried to charge them the buyout price for non-returned books. They also used various aliases and other tricks to bypass Amazon’s fifteen-book limit. In all, they stole 14,000 textbooks worth over $1.5 million.
The article doesn’t link to the indictment, so I don’t know how they were discovered.

                    <span>Players hoping to get stuck into Techland&#x27;s impressive Switch port of Dying Light have run into a pretty significant hurdle while trying to purchase the zombies-and-parkour shooter from Nintendo&#x27;s eShop; the digital version is currently unavailable in the UK and across Europe as a result of Dying Light being banned from sale in Germany.
Switch players began flagging Dying Light: Platinum Edition&#x27;s unexpected absence from eShop in multiple territories, despite its 19th October release date, over on Reddit. The mystery was eventually solved by an official Techland spokesperson, who explained the issue stems from the fact Nintendo&#x27;s European eShop is registered in Germany - a country where Dying Light is currently unrated and thus prohibited from sale.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve found yourself tantalised by Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming extreme sports game Riders Republic, but not so much that you&#x27;re quite ready to commit, you might like to get involved in the newly announced Free Trial week, giving players up to four hours with the full game ahead of launch.
Riders Republic, a spiritual successor to 2016&#x27;s underrated Steep, expands on the open-world winter sports action of that game to usher in a fuller roster of activities. There&#x27;s skiing, snowboarding, biking, and wing suits (of the vanilla and jet-powered varieties), playable both solo and competitively, with Ubisoft&#x27;s heavily pushing the game&#x27;s large-scale competitions for upward of 50 players.

                    <span>Yesterday, Valve unveiled a new compatibility ratings system for Steam Deck, intended to give users a clear indication of how well specific Steam games will run on the upcoming portable gaming PC. And now, a new beta update for Half-Life 2 has been discovered, seemingly released to ensure the seminal FPS meets the requirements needed to earn Steam Deck&#x27;s top-tier Verified compatibility badge.
Half-Life 2&#x27;s new beta branch update, as spotted and detailed by Valve watcher Tyler McVicker on YouTube, reportedly covers a surprising amount of ground, not only making adjustments to the way the UI and resolution are handled in-game - primarily to ensure Half-Life 2 fits Steam Deck&#x27;s aspect ratio and remains legible at the machine&#x27;s relatively diminutive size - but addressing some long-standing bugs as well.

Supposedly this is a promotional trailer for next year&#x27;s much-anticipated Pokémon Legends: Arceus. But really, it feels more like Pokémon&#x27;s take on Blair Witch. Lavender Town was nothing on this.

                    <span>Sony is testing a limited-release beta for PS5 players to share screenshots and clips through the PlayStation app.

                    <span>The company that told Sony &quot;go ahead, sue us&quot; then pulled its replacement PlayStation 5 plates from sale after Sony threatened to sue them is now selling redesigned PS5 plates - and has taunted Sony once again in the process.
In February, Canadian-based device customisation company Dbrand launched its replacement PS5 plates, dubbed Darkplates, with a brazen attitude towards the prospect of a Sony takedown.

                    <span>Researchers trained a machine-learning system on videos of people typing their PINs into ATMs:
By using three tries, which is typically the maximum allowed number of attempts before the card is withheld, the researchers reconstructed the correct sequence for 5-digit PINs 30% of the time, and reached 41% for 4-digit PINs.

This works even if the person is covering the pad with their hands.

                    <span>According to a report from CISA last week, there were three ransomware attacks against water treatment plants last year.
WWS Sector cyber intrusions from 2019 to early 2021 include:
In August 2021, malicious cyber actors used Ghost variant ransomware against a California-based WWS facility. The ransomware variant had been in the system for about a month and was discovered when three supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers displayed a ransomware message.
In July 2021, cyber actors used remote access to introduce ZuCaNo ransomware onto a Maine-based WWS facility’s wastewater SCADA computer. The treatment system was run manually until the SCADA computer was restored using local control and more frequent operator rounds.

The post will show you how to create a specialized service kube-proxy
style network proxier using Kubernetes Proxy NG
kpng without interfering
with the existing kube-proxy. The kpng project aims at renewing the
the default Kubernetes Service implementation, the &quot;kube-proxy&quot;. An
important feature of kpng is that it can be used as a library to
create proxiers outside K8s. While this is useful for CNI-plugins that
replaces the kube-proxy it also opens the possibility for anyone to
create a proxier for a special purpose.
Define a service that uses a specialized proxier

                    <span>Pokémon Unite, like almost all live-service games at this spookiest time of the year, is getting in on the Halloween action with a  major new patch that will, among other things, add the (not especially spooky) squirrel-like Pokémon Greedent.
Greedent makes a brief appearance in Pokémon Unite&#x27;s new Halloween Festival reveal trailer, but specifics regarding its abilities are pretty limited right now. Instead, we&#x27;re mostly treating to the spooky stuff, which includes a Halloween-y map makeover, replete with pumpkins and other seasonal trimmings.

                    <span>As the release of Steam Deck draws ever closer, Valve continues sharing more details about its highly anticipated portable gaming PC, and the company has now announced it&#x27;ll reviewing the entire Steam catalogue to create a new compatibility ratings system.
As outlined in Valve&#x27;s latest video, all games on Steam will fall into one of four categories - Verified, Playable, Unsupported, and Unknown - giving Steam Deck users an easy, at-a-glance means of checking compatibility with their system.

                    <span>Two and a half months after the arrival of Apex Legends&#x27; season ten hero Seer, it&#x27;s time to do the official dance of welcoming once more, as developer Respawn Entertainment formally introduces the free-to-play shooter&#x27;s next new playable character, Ash.
Ash should be immediately recognisable to fans of Respawn&#x27;s previous work, given the formidable simulacrum played a prominent role in Titanfall 2 - but should also be familiar to Apex Legends players too, having been restored during Season 5&#x27;s Broken Ghost quest.

Outriders initially launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation back in April, delivering a slice of co-operative sci-fi shooter action Eurogamer reviewer Vikki Blake enjoyed, albeit with some provisos, in her review. &quot;For some,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I suspect Outriders doesn&#x27;t innovate enough to stand out from an already oversaturated shooter market, relying too much on the ideas of other, stronger titles that have come before it.&quot;

                    <span>With the Analogue Pocket set for release later this year, some new details about the device and future Analogue products has surfaced with the reveal of Analogue OS.

The library feature is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects. This database of information, accessible directly from the device, was seemingly curated with the goal of identifying any and all variants of a game. For games which have had dozens of revisions, including different regions, the library can provide all relevant information. This could even help identify pirate carts as simply inserting the game into the unit will provide information about that specific cartridge. Knowing how common pirated Game Boy cartridges have become, this could become a quick way to identify legit carts for collectors.

Two years on, the meme still lingers and Microsoft has announced you&#x27;ll be able to pre-order your very own official Xbox Series X mini fridge starting next Tuesday.
Microsoft initially embraced the Xbox fridge meme (with considerably gusto) last October, when it sent real Xbox Series X fridges - 6-foot, 400 pound, 1:1 scale replicas of the console - out to influencers and rapper Snoop Dogg. The gag was resurrected once again this March when Microsoft produced some mini fridge variants of the full-sized design to use as prizes in a promotion for Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson&#x27;s new energy drink.

                    <span>Even before Apple made its announcement, law enforcement shifted their battle for backdoors to client-side scanning. The idea is that they wouldn’t touch the cryptography, but instead eavesdrop on communications and systems before encryption or after decryption. It’s not a cryptographic backdoor, but it’s still a backdoor — and brings with it all the insecurities of a backdoor.
I’m part of a group of cryptographers that has just published a paper discussing the security risks of such a system. (It’s substantially the same group that wrote a similar paper about ...</span>

                    <span>Metroid Dread has been a critical and commercial success, surpassing all expectations for the return of Nintendo&#x27;s long-dormant franchise, but some of the people involved in its creation have begun airing their disappointment at not being credited for their work - criticism that developer MercurySteam has now addressed.
As reported by Spanish website Vandal, several former MercurySteam employees recently took to the internet to query their names being omitted from Metroid Dread&#x27;s credits, despite being involved in the production of the title. &quot;I would like to sincerely congratulate the Metroid Dread team for putting out such an outstanding game,&quot; wrote 3D artist Roberto Mejías on LinkedIn. &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised of the quality of the game though, since the amount of talent on that team was through the roof. I know this first hand because, despite not being included on the game&#x27;s credits, I was part of that team for for eight months.&quot;

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a rough ride for Paradox Entertainment&#x27;s long-in-the-works RPG sequel Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, and now the publisher has admitted it almost cancelled the project after its original developer Hardsuit Labs was ditched earlier this year.
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, a sequel to developer Troika Games&#x27; much-loved 2004 cult-classic RPG, was announced back in 2019 with a PC and console release expected the following year. Sequel-starved fans were delights at the news, particularly after it was confirmed Troika&#x27;s Brian Mitsoda would assist with writing duties - but first hints of development troubles surfaced later that year when Hardsuit announced the first of several delays.

                    <span>This weekend sees the Pokémon Go fan community finally descend upon Liverpool, for the game&#x27;s first ever UK Safari Zone. Of course, this event was supposed to happen last year, back in March 2020, but the world had other plans. 
Now rejigged as a hybrid event, where players can travel to Liverpool&#x27;s Sefton Park or play remotely, this revived gathering is another stepping stone back to &quot;normality&quot; for a game which has been forced to make huge changes over the past 18 months - but which has emerged still as popular as ever.

                    <span>Hazard Zone, the third major part of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s offering, has finally been revealed, with the mode seeing squads of four compete with each other across existing maps to extract packages. 
The mode, which seems to cobble together familiar elements from the likes of The Division&#x27;s Dark Zone and Escape From Tarkov while serving them up in Battlefield style, got its reveal via a new trailer with DICE working to fill in the gaps in a pre-briefing.

                    <span>New paper: “This Person (Probably) Exists. Identity Membership Attacks Against GAN Generated Faces.
Abstract: Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved stunning realism, fooling even human observers. Indeed, the popular tongue-in-cheek website http://thispersondoesnotexist.com, taunts users with GAN generated images that seem too real to believe. On the other hand, GANs do leak information about their training data, as evidenced by membership attacks recently demonstrated in the literature. In this work, we challenge the assumption that GAN faces really are novel creations, by constructing a successful membership attack of a new kind. Unlike previous works, our attack can accurately discern samples sharing the same identity as training samples without being the same samples. We demonstrate the interest of our attack across several popular face datasets and GAN training procedures. Notably, we show that even in the presence of significant dataset diversity, an over represented person can pose a privacy concern...</span>

However, &quot;at least two years of talks&quot; are said to have now stalled as the two parties struggle to agree on specifics, with FIFA wanting to increase the cost of its licence by &quot;more than $1 billion for each four-year World Cup cycle&quot; - perhaps eager to capitalise on the exponential growth of Ultimate Team, which made EA $1.62bn in its 2021 financial year, mostly through FIFA.

                    <span>HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us is filming now, and a fresh set photo has given us our best look yet at The Mandalorian star Pedro Pascal as Joel. 
Pascal was papped in costume this morning by Kristin Raworth (thanks, The Last of Us News) entering the downtown Edmonton set which is standing in for the game&#x27;s Boston area.

                    <span>Remember Games for Windows Live? It&#x27;s a name I&#x27;ve not heard for a long time, but something which was still plaguing Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition on PC until just this week. 
Games for Windows Live was Microsoft&#x27;s much-hated first attempt at getting Xbox Live-style features on PC, stuffed in a launcher that no one wanted to use, and initially for a $50/year subscription.

                    <span>While the future of EA Sports&#x27; licensing deal with FIFA is looking increasingly uncertain, the publisher has announced it&#x27;s renewed its contract with FIFPRO to &quot;deliver the greatest, most authentic football [video game] experience&quot;.
The renewal, described only as a &quot;long-term commitment&quot;, will enable EA to continue using the &quot;thousands of player names and likenesses&quot; supported by the FIFPRO license agreement in its football games, alongside various official leagues, including the UEFA Champions League, CONMEBOL Libertadores, Premier League, Bundesliga, and LaLiga Santander.

                    <span>It’s been three years since I turned down an attractive job offer at AWS because of the required noncompete agreement. Frankly, I still don’t have any regrets about the decision as Amazon piles on. Since this article was originally published in August 2019, a lot has happened: AWS sued Brian Hall in 2020 under the […]

                    <span>It’s a matter of going after those with deep pockets. From Wired:
Cloudflare was sued in November 2018 by Mon Cheri Bridals and Maggie Sottero Designs, two wedding dress manufacturers and sellers that alleged Cloudflare was guilty of contributory copyright infringement because it didn’t terminate services for websites that infringed on the dressmakers’ copyrighted designs….
[Judge] Chhabria noted that the dressmakers have been harmed “by the proliferation of counterfeit retailers that sell knock-off dresses using the plaintiffs’ copyrighted images” and that they have “gone after the infringers in a range of actions, but to no avail — every time a website is successfully shut down, a new one takes its place.” Chhabria continued, “In an effort to more effectively stamp out infringement, the plaintiffs now go after a service common to many of the infringers: Cloudflare. The plaintiffs claim that Cloudflare contributes to the underlying copyright infringement by providing infringers with caching, content delivery, and security services. Because a reasonable jury could not — at least on this record — conclude that Cloudflare materially contributes to the underlying copyright infringement, the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is denied and Cloudflare’s motion for summary judgment is granted.”...</span>

                    <span>Mario Party Superstars is poised to delve into the series&#x27; past to deliver some classic board-and-minigame action on Switch later this month, starting 29th October, and Nintendo has offered a closer look at both ahead of its launch.
Drawing on over two decades of releases, Mario Party Superstars features five boards taken from the series&#x27; N64 era - Yoshi&#x27;s Tropical Island, Space Land, Peach&#x27;s Birthday Cake, Woody Woods, and Horror Land - all redesigned for Switch and featuring their own unique events, while its minigames have been selected from all across previous Mario Party instalments.

The original enhanced edition - which bundles together Quake, its two official expansions, plus two additional expansions by Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games - was already an extremely solid brush-up of the quarter-century-old FPS classic, but the newly released &quot;next-gen&quot; upgrade adds a little extra oomph for Xbox Series X/S and PS5 owners.
