                              <span>A new and long-awaited feature for Grounded has been revealed by developer Obsidian. 


This feature, known as &#x27;Shared World&#x27;, allows players to create and &quot;own&quot; up to three shared worlds (hence the name) which will then be stored in the cloud. These can then be shared with friends and family to enable them to host that world &quot;while you are not online&quot;.


In turn, each player can also have up to 50 worlds shared with them at any given time. In addition to this, Obsidian states that any player&#x27;s standard worlds can be changed to a shared world if they wish. This is done through the game&#x27;s save and load menu.

Well, now we have another leak, and it appears that more unexpected characters will also be joining the brawler further down the road, with voice lines for both The Wizard of Oz&#x27;s Wicked Witch of the West and BeetleJuice being found in the game&#x27;s files.


As shared by MultiVersus Twitter user AisulMV (the same leaker who discovered hints about a potential feature which will allow players to share their battle pass progress), the lines of dialogue found appear to be setting MultiVersus up for a spooky season.

                              <span>It&#x27;s something of an industry joke that iconic 90s shooter Doom is playable on almost anything. Now it&#x27;s playable on a tractor.


There&#x27;s a more serious background to this, though. As Wired reports, a hacker known as Sick Codes presented a new jailbreak for John Deere &amp; Co. tractors at the DefCon security conference in Las Vegas.


Digital locks are imposed on vehicles by manufacturers, preventing farmers from modifying and repairing their own equipment. The right-to-repair has proven controversial in the farming industry, but Sick Codes has found a workaround.

Currently priced at $6.99 (£5.19 in the UK), the Flavour Packs will cost $12.99 from 13th September.


In a forum post (thanks TheGamer), the developer said it was &quot;altering the prices of our Flavour Packs (Northern Lords and Fate of Iberia) to reflect the overall value of this kind of content moving forward&quot;.

                              <span>Disney has announced it&#x27;s hosting a game-focused digital showcase this September, with a &quot;sneak peek&quot; at Amy Hennig&#x27;s new Marvel game promising to be a highlight.


The Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, which is running as part of this year&#x27;s D23 Expo, will be streamed on Friday, 9th September, at 9pm in the UK/1pm PT. It&#x27;s promising &quot;all-new announcements&quot; alongside additional details on previously revealed games.


There&#x27;ll be more from Disney Dreamlight Valley, for instance, alongside additional news on Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga and the recently delayed Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns. The real draw, though, unless you really love your village life sims, is a glimpse of Skydance New Media and Hennig&#x27;s &quot;Marvel ensemble&quot; game.

                              <span>This is more of a demonstration than a real-world vulnerability, but researchers can use electromagnetic interference to remotely control touchscreens.
From a news article:
It’s important to note that the attack has a few key limitations. Firstly, the hackers need to know the target’s phone passcode, or launch the attack while the phone is unlocked. Secondly, the victim needs to put the phone face down, otherwise the battery and motherboard will block the electromagnetic signal. Thirdly, the antenna array has to be no more than four centimeters (around 1.5 inches) away. For all these reasons the researchers themselves admit that the “invisible finger” technique is a proof of concept that at this point is far from being a threat outside of a university lab.  ...</span>

A subsidiary of The Pokémon Company, The Pokémon Company International is responsible for the Pokémon brand in all regions other than Asia.


As the Pokémon series has hit 25 years since its first game was released (Pokémon Red and Blue in 1996), the company has pledged to donate at least $25 million over five years to organisations across the world dedicated to &quot;improving the lives of children and supporting social equity&quot;.

EA has announced a collaboration with Marvel that reimagines some of the most famous footballers of yesteryear as superheroes.


Ex-footballers such as USA stalwart Landon Donovan, legendary Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho and all-conquering Man City midfielder Yaya Touré have unique illustrated designs that replace real-world player photos in FIFA 23&#x27;s Ultimate Team mode.

More specifically, we want to play as annoying little critters and get away with all sorts of things that real human life does not look kindly upon.


Thankfully, indie developers have been paying attention to the success seen by previous games like Goat Simulator and Untitled Goose Game.

                              <span>PlayStation has unveiled a new trailer ahead of God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s release.


This trailer, titled Myths of Midgard, offers a brief summary of 2018&#x27;s God of War epic. It stars Felicia Day, as she narrates the story of Kratos and Atreus so far. There are also little &#x27;cameos&#x27; from know-it-all Mimir throughout the retelling, which is full of some really gorgeous artwork.

So, it turns out that those &#x27;travellers&#x27; that litter Hyrule, but are in fact members of the Yiga Clan in disguise, are actually &quot;evil twins&quot; of other inhabitants found across the map.


As documented by justlookingfordragon on Reddit, the &#x27;disguises&#x27; used by the Yiga are &quot;1:1 clones of other, properly named NPCs that exist somewhere&quot; in the game&#x27;s world.

                              <span>Matt, one of the most famous faces from Nintendo Wii Sports era, is now available in Switch Sports for those that are looking to up their game.


&quot;Interested in a tougher challenge in #NintendoSwitchSports,&quot; asked Nintendo. &quot;Try entering ZR + R + A or ZL + L + → on the difficulty select screen.&quot;


This text in itself wasn&#x27;t enough to set the internet ablaze. However, the picture accompanying the news was. Why? Because it showed Matt with his new &#x27;legend&#x27; title brandishing a baton ready to take on players (thanks, IGN).

Many potential attendees were put off by the lack of safety measures, but following the policy update others are now refusing to attend due to the mask requirement.


FaZe Clan is organising its own event in San Diego at the same time, and its co-owner Nickmercs has stated masks won&#x27;t be required.

There are already several mods which reshade the game, like this one from BadRusMan that emulates a more cinematic style, or overhaul the visuals, like this noir mod by ManWithAPlan.


There&#x27;s also a mod which disables the HUD and enemy outlines, by Mixerced, if you want to remove the interface whilst you play.

This leak came from industry insider AestheticGamer, also known as Dusk Golem. 


&quot;I&#x27;m just holding onto a bunch of misc God of War Ragnarok things right now, decided to only post concept art of Odin. All I&#x27;m going to post, and yes, Odin looks a lot different than I imagined too,&quot; they wrote before sharing the image and wishing everyone a good day.

Cyberpunk 2077 is based on the Cyberpunk 2020 TTRPG from 1988, but has Silverhand played by Keanu Reeves in a central role to the plot.

As revealed by _FireMonkey on Twitter, the twosome can be seen in the game&#x27;s season one startup screen, which Warner Bros. set live a little too early. The company had originally said that upcoming fighters would be teased in MultiVersus&#x27; start up screen, but unfortunately the developer jumped the gun a bit on that one.


The duo will join the likes of current characters such as Bugs Bunny, Batman and Arya Stark. Meanwhile, Morty of Rick and Morty fame will be joining the fray on 23rd August.

                              <span>Scammers were able to convince YouTube that other peoples’ music was their own. They successfully stole $23 million before they were caught.
No one knows how common this scam is, and how much money total is being stolen in this way. Presumably this is not an uncommon fraud.
While the size of the heist and the breadth of the scheme may be very unique, it’s certainly a situation that many YouTube content creators have faced before. YouTube’s Content ID system, meant to help creators, has been weaponized by bad faith actors in order to make money off content that isn’t theirs. While some false claims are just mistakes caused by automated systems, the MediaMuv case is a perfect example of how fraudsters are also purposefully taking advantage of digital copyright rules...</span>

Hello, everyone 👋
Welcome back to the third edition of the &quot;Meet Our Contributors&quot; blog post series for APAC.
This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project.
So, without further ado, let&#x27;s get straight to the article.

Confirmation comes via Brazilian court papers wherein Microsoft is defending its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in front of the Brazilian competition authority, CADE.

As spotted by GameLuster and translated via Google Translate - so bear with me; this may not be a 100 per cent word-for-word translation - page 17/18 (paragraph 46) of Microsoft&#x27;s own published court papers state that &quot;Sony has surpassed Microsoft in terms of console sales and installed [sic] base, having sold more than twice as many Xbox [One units] in the last generation&quot;.

&quot;It has come to our attention that someone is offering beta testing for Lil Gator Game,&quot; publisher Playtonic tweeted over the weekend. &quot;We can confirm this is a SCAM and not from Playtonic or Lil Gator Game.

&quot;If we were offering this to our communities we would announce it on our Twitter and not via any other channels,&quot; the tweet added.

                              <span>Three fans have taken Better Call Saul and Gameboy&#x27;d it.

A three-minute teaser - which includes light spoilers for S1E9, S5E8, and S6E5, so be warned - lovingly recreates Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould&#x27;s Breaking Bad spin-off as a monochrome Gameboy game, complete with plenty of fan service touches, including one of the scariest things I&#x27;ve ever seen: a happy Mike.

The demake includes character options - which ranks your three playable characters Jimmy, Kim, and Mike by their Guts, Hustle, Authority, and Lawyer traits as well as unique passive skills - cut-scenes, and even a fab chip-tune version of the theme track. The slightly spoilerific gameplay we see plays on some of the scenarios Jimmy&#x27;s found himself in over the years and I really, really want to play it.

                              <span>It looks like another Avatar game - this one called Avatar The Last Airbender: Quest for Balance - is on the way.

This is a different Avatar game from Ubisoft&#x27;s recently delayed Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and also different from Avatar: Generations, which was announced earlier this week and is, confusingly, also seemingly based on the popular Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender. 

As spotted by VGC, the unannounced PS4 game has popped up on Amazon Japan with a mid-November release date, but interestingly, it&#x27;s listed as an import from North America, suggesting it&#x27;s a Western release.

                              <span>A new livestream has revealed more about Genshin Impact&#x27;s upcoming 3.0 update, The Morn a Thousand Rose Brings.

Along with a lengthy new teaser video - which you can see below - we learned that 3.0, entitled The Morn a Thousand Rose Brings, is all set to release on 24th August, 2022.

As Jessica recently summarised for us, 3.0 brings the Sumeru region to the game, the Dendro element, continues the main storyline, and will introduce lots of new characters. We now know these include four-star Electro Dori, along with upcoming additions five-star Dendro Tighnari and Collei, the latter of which - who is a four-star Dendro specialist - can be added for free via the Graven Innocence event. Zhongli is making a return, along with Ganyu and Kokomi, all of whom are five-star.

                              <span>Director Chad Stahelski has confirmed that his movie adaptation of Ghost of Tsushima will be &quot;a complete Japanese cast, in Japanese&quot;.

Speaking to Collider, Stahelski said that while it may &quot;scare the shit out of most people&quot;, Sony is &quot;on board with backing [him] on that&quot; and &quot;Western audiences in general are getting more and more used to [reading subtitles]&quot;.

&quot;Honestly, it&#x27;s probably the same things that would scare the shit out of most people. It&#x27;s a fantasy period piece,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s done with reverence to Akira Kurosawa, who&#x27;s probably in the top five biggest influences of my life as far as film goes. It&#x27;s a chance to push technology and people in a story that&#x27;s timeless. It&#x27;s your typical mythological story of good versus evil, finding a man, watching him change the world or the world changes him. It&#x27;s all the Joseph Campbell stuff that you&#x27;d love in a story. You put that in with, obviously, so I&#x27;m told I have a bit of a Samurai fetish, which is probably true from Manga and anime and stuff.

Pearl Lai, who was Konami&#x27;s first-party lead at the time, took to Twitter to talk candidly - and diplomatically - about the time the free-to-play Silent Hills teaser was controversially pulled from the Sony store eight years ago yesterday (12th August).

&quot;Fun fact: since I was the first-party lead at the time at Konami, I helped get this product set up on the storefronts, fake publisher and everything,&quot; they tweeted (thanks, VGC).

&quot;Today, 12th August, is my 50th birthday,&quot; Kobayashi&#x27;s statement begins. &quot;As such, I would like to share something very special with everyone: After serving 27 years with gratitude, I have departed from Capcom on 1st March and will be officially joining NetEase as a producer.

                              <span>Nintendo has confirmed that it has no plans to increase the price of its Nintendo Switch console.

Despite a drop in sales of around 23 per cent year-on-year - chiefly due to the tech industry&#x27;s ongoing shortage of semiconductor parts stifling manufacturing - Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told Nikkei that Nintendo wanted to &quot;avoid pricing people out&quot;.

&quot;We&#x27;re not considering [a price increase] at this point, for two reasons,&quot; Furukawa said (thanks, NME). &quot;In order to offer unique entertainment to a wide range of customers, we want to avoid pricing people out. Our competition is the variety of entertainment in the world, and we always think about pricing in terms of the value of the fun we offer.

                              <span>It looks like a lot of Phasmophobia players hope to see smaller maps in upcoming updates.

In a poll in the game&#x27;s subreddit community and spotted by PCGN, players were invited to vote on the next map they would like to see join the Phasmophobia rotation. Options include a circus/carnival, mall/movie theatre, manufacturing plant, office park/corporate building, and a small town square.

Whilst thousands of players have voted on their preference, some took to the comments to talk about the size those hypothetical maps could be, and posited that smaller maps were important, too.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal players are reporting a new bug that is &quot;reducing XP for everyone&quot;.

A thread on the game&#x27;s subreddit community - complete with examples and screenshots - is claiming that &quot;there’s a bug that reduces the XP earned on a significant portion of kills and XP globes&quot;. 

&quot;We don’t fully understand why or when it will happen,&quot; explains u/staplepies (thanks, NME), who&#x27;s one of five players &quot;looking at this on and off for the last month or so&quot;.

                              <span>Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands&#x27; fourth DLC chapter, Shattering Spectreglass, is out now, &quot;expanding the endgame experience&quot; with a new class, better character creation options, a new boss, and &quot;incredible loot&quot;.

Available for no extra cost for those who already own the season pass - and to buy separately for those who don&#x27;t - Shattering Spectreglass ushers in the all-new Blightcaller class which &quot;allows players to harness the noxious essence of swamps with potent precision, alongside new ways to customise your Fatemaker, including an all-new voice&quot;.

&quot;Shattering Spectreglass begins in Dreamveil Overlook, where players will face Vesper’s most personal Mirror of Mystery yet,&quot; 2K explains. &quot;Shattering Spectreglass offers a window into Vesper&#x27;s memories, which are plagued by visions of Redmourne the Trivern, a mighty beast that can grow multiple heads and feeds on fear, siphoning his power from lost souls. Bringing down this winged behemoth once and for all is the only way to help Vesper escape her past.&quot;

Confirming the new figures in its latest financial report, developer/publisher Krafton confirmed that net profit for the company was up 37 per cent when compared with the same quarter last year, even though both operating profit and revenue were down by 6.9 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. 

94 per cent of the battle royale&#x27;s revenue is generated outside of South Korea, where the game is made.

                              <span>The all-consuming IP hoover that is THQ Nordic has done a showcase! Mixing a nostalgia-baiting slate of 90s revivals with some intriguing newcomers, it was a surprisingly busy one too. So if you missed it and find yourself eager for updates on previously announced titles like Outcast 2, Jagged Alliance 3, and Gothic, plus some big new reveals - most notably the return of Alone in the Dark - read on.

Alone in the Dark


As rumoured, the grandaddy of survival horror is back in what THQ Nordic and developer Pieces Interactive is calling a &quot;reimagining&quot; of the 1992 original. It&#x27;s being written and directed by Mikael Hedberg, who wrote the stunning Soma at Frictional Games, and is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at a later date. We&#x27;ve got a little more on this promising project elsewhere.

                              <span>UK developer Three Fields Entertainment - the studio behind the likes of Dangerous Golf and Dangerous Driving - has unveiled Wreckreation, a new custom-content-focused open-world racer coming to PC, PlayStation, and Xbox next year.


Three Fields - a studio founded by a small group of ex-Criterion developers - describes Wreckreation as a game of high-speed racing, crashing, stunts, and exploration, all of which unfolds across a 400-square-mile map. That map is designed to represent an entire (fictitious) American state split into four areas, albeit one predominantly themed around woodland, grassland, and sandy beaches.


As to how players approach the challenges within Wreckreation&#x27;s world, the idea is that it&#x27;s entirely up to them, with Three Fields saying it wants to encourage a more freeform style of fun as players explore the world in search of races, short cuts, and challenges.

                              <span>Mirage Game Studios - the developer behind well-received factory sim Little Big Workshop - has shared a first look at its adorable galactic property magnate game Space for Sale, which is due to launch on PC at a currently undisclosed date.


Space for Sale casts players in the role of a cute astronaut that&#x27;s just bought an entire galaxy on the cheap, with the aim of turning it into a dream destination for alien homeseekers across the cosmos. To reach that goal, players must scour the galaxy&#x27;s procedural planets in search of the perfect spot to fulfil their clients&#x27; sometimes eccentric needs.


Although Space for Sale&#x27;s basic concept sounds very management sim, Mirage says the game&#x27;s sandbox-style gameplay is more of a &quot;hands-on experience&quot; than that might suggest, with players needing to explore each planet in person as they hunt down the ideal location to drop a plot, construct buildings, collect resources, scan items, and so on.

                              <span>THQ Nordic is &#x27;reimagining&#x27; survival horror classic Alone in the Dark, with Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent writer Mikael Hedberg at the helm.


Alone in the Dark, for those too young to remember, is widely considered to be the granddaddy of the survival horror genre, with the 1992 original pioneering the fixed-camera spook-house formula that would go on to influence the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.


THQ Nordic&#x27;s reimagined version of Alone in the Dark - which is being handled by Swedish developer Pieces Interactive - takes the basic premise of the 1992 original, in which private detective Edward Carnby helps Emily Hartwood investigate her uncle&#x27;s suicide at the gloomy Derceto Mansion, and shakes it up a little for modern audiences.

An epic new trailer for the patch includes plenty of gameplay (and Endwalker story spoilers) from across the update, and some cute dancing Loporrits - moon bunnies for the uninitiated.

The mod, uploaded earlier this week, replaces usual protagonist Kiryu Kazuma with Halo&#x27;s poster boy Master Chief. Specifically his incarnation in Halo 3.


Kashiiera is primarily a Halo modder as it&#x27;s their favourite franchise, but they also love Yakuza and so worked hard to project Master Chief&#x27;s model correctly onto Kiryu&#x27;s to keep him looking as natural as possible.

Blinnk and the Vacuum of Space starts off on the first day of your new job at Norp Corp. However, your new boss, a certain Mister Norp, is a hungry chap, with only one demand. You must bring him &quot;the greatest sandwich in the galaxy&quot;.


This may all sound easy enough, I mean how hard can bread and filling be? Well, it turns out it can be a lot harder than you may expect, especially when robot companion Blinnk is involved.

                              <span>Bungie has detailed some of the changes that are coming to Destiny 2. 


In its weekly blog post, or TWAB, the company explained some of the weapon balance changes players can expect, which includes buffing some of the game&#x27;s under-utilised weapon archetypes.


For example, lightweight bows will get faster draw times as well as an increased &quot;perfect draw&quot; window to make things a bit easier for players.

CACI International, for context, is an IT company which provides technology to various US federal and state government agencies. 


Marc Whitten, senior vice president at Unity and general manager of Unity Create, explained Unity&#x27;s role in the contract as &quot;defining human machine interfaces or HMI for aerospace applications and beyond&quot; in the company&#x27;s follow-up earnings call, as reported by Bloomberg.

Earlier this year, Bungie alleged copyright infringement and breach of contract against AimJunkies for its Destiny 2 &quot;hacks&quot;, but the court dismissed much of the case.



Bungie was allowed more time to reinstate its case and a few weeks later alleged that AimJunkies had reverse-engineered and copied the software code for Destiny 2.

The map, which is called Farm 18, was inspired by Modern Warefare&#x27;s Shoothouse map.


&quot;We tried to think of hidden training facilities, but it is also in an industrial cement factory,&quot; explained Geoff Smith, the director of multiplayer map design on Modern Warfare 2.

The game is being developed by Square Enix London Mobile in partnership with Navigator Games, and is described as a &quot;free-to-play, RPG adventure&quot;.


At release, the game will follow the main gang (Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Suki, Zuko, Appa and Momo) across the storyline of the series. New stories are promised too, as well as &quot;fan-favourite locations, stories, and events in an open world&quot;. Subsequent updates will feature other minor characters from The Last Airbender such as Avatar Kyoshi, as well as characters and storylines from Avatar: The Legend of Korra.

Nintendo&#x27;s Splatoon 3 Direct earlier this week detailed what&#x27;s new in the game, but a note on the official website states that save data can be transferred and players will receive in-game rewards for doing so.



Apparently &quot;five out of five Squid Research Lab scientists recommend transferring data from Splatoon 2 if you have it&quot;. So that&#x27;s that.

Welcomely, the new release date is actually really soon. In fact, it is as soon as 15th August.


This also means that Morty will soon be joining the fray. His arrival to the game will be a little after season one&#x27;s debut, with the new fighter now coming on 23rd August.

                              <span>Twitter accidentally exposed the personal information—including phone numbers and email addresses—for 5.4 million accounts. And someone was trying to sell this information.
In January 2022, we received a report through our bug bounty program of a vulnerability in Twitter’s systems. As a result of the vulnerability, if someone submitted an email address or phone number to Twitter’s systems, Twitter’s systems would tell the person what Twitter account the submitted email addresses or phone number was associated with, if any. This bug resulted from an update to our code in June 2021. When we learned about this, we immediately investigated and fixed it. At that time, we had no evidence to suggest someone had taken advantage of the vulnerability. ...</span>

                              <span>My personal definition of a brilliant idea is one that is immediately obvious once it’s explained, but no one has thought of it before. I can’t believe that no one has described this taxonomy of access control before Eyal Ittay laid it out in this paper. The paper is about cryptocurrency wallet design, but the ideas are more general. Ittay points out that a key—or an account, or anything similar—can be in one of four states:
safe Only the user has access,
loss No one has access,
leak Both the user and the adversary have access, or
theft Only the adversary has access...</span>

                              <span>WashBear Studio&#x27;s charming, thoroughly enjoyable dinosaur park management sim Parkasaurus is looking to wow guests with a whole new, decidedly more acquatic, selection of exhibits from today, with the arrival of its new Sea Monsters DLC on PC.


Building on Parkasaurus&#x27; core management action - which takes obvious inspiration from the likes of Theme Park and DinoPark Tycoon - the new Sea Monsters DLC introduces 11 aquatic reptiles and fish, as well as flooded enclosures, for players to install on their quest to create the ultimate dino-flavoured tourist attraction.


If you&#x27;re looking for specifics, those new dinos are Elasmosaurus, Plesiosaurus, Mosasaurus, Atopodentatus, Sarcosuchus, Archelon, Dunkleosteus, Liopleurodon, Ichthyosaurus, Placodus, and Megalodon. But Sea Monsters also introduces three new campaign missions, three new biomes, and 20+ exhibit items and hats - all of which will set you back £5.19/$6.99 USD.

                              <span>If plain old football doesn&#x27;t quite do it for you, but your interest is piqued when I say football but melded to a silly, sprawling action-RPG, then allow me to introduce you to Soccer Story from publisher No More Robots and Not Tonight developer PanicBarn, coming to Steam, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Game Pass &quot;soon&quot;.


Soccer Story (which, despite the name and similar premise, is unrelated to developer Sidebar Games&#x27; magnificent Golf Story) is a single-player &quot;physics-based&quot; adventure in which players must quest, puzzle, and sport their way to restoring football - and, thus, peace and harmony - in a world where it&#x27;s been banned.


Soccer Story promises an adventure packed with &quot;quirky characters, quests, rogue refs, and wack soccer-adjacent sports&quot;, where every problem - from solving puzzles to finding secrets - can be overcome with the help of your magic football.

Announced last June, Metal Slug Tactics reunites familiar faces Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma as they lead the Peregrine Falcon Squad onto a different kind of battlefield, where the series&#x27; classic side-scrolling action makes way for &quot;dynamic, strategic combat&quot; on a grid-based map.


Skill trees, perks, and a &quot;super attack-fueling&quot; adrenaline system have all been been promised upon Metal Slug Tactics&#x27; arrival, which was originally expected to occur at some point this year.

                              <span>Inflexion Games, the studio founded by former BioWare boss Aaryn Flynn, has announced a delay for its Victorian fantasy adventure Nightingale, with the game now expected to enter early access some time next year.


Nightingale, described as a &quot;shared world survival crafting game&quot;, was initially announced a few years back, but got its first proper unveiling at last year&#x27;s The Game Awards. Its reveal was accompanied by an eye-catching trailer in which well-dressed ladies and gents travelled through portals to strange new worlds, full of wonderfully unsettling eldritch creatures.


Inflexion was initially aiming to launch Nightingale into early access at some point this year, but the developer has now revised that plan, pushing the game&#x27;s early access release back into the &quot;first half of 2023&quot;.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the ongoing fallout from Microsoft and Sony&#x27;s squabbling over Activision Blizzard and it&#x27;s blockbuster franchise Call of Duty.


If you&#x27;ve been living under a rock for the last six months, this all stems from Microsoft&#x27;s intent to buy Activision for 68.7bn, which Sony isn&#x27;t too happy about. Recently we&#x27;ve heard arguments from Sony offering some of its views on the deal - that it would be bad news for PlayStation, essentially - and now Microsoft itself has hit back. 

Microsoft has reiterated that it does not want to make Call of Duty an Xbox exclusive - for now, at least - and even said it would be an unprofitable move if it did so. Even more remarkably, it has also hit out at Sony for suggesting the Microsoft-Activision deal would stifle competition - and claimed PlayStation itself pays out money to block games coming to Xbox Game Pass.

Comprised of members Shiver, Frye and Big Man, Nintendo showed off one of Deep Cut&#x27;s performances for Splatfest celebrations.

                              <span>EA has confirmed it&#x27;s sticking with loot boxes for FIFA 23&#x27;s Ultimate Team mode, after the company was effectively given the green light by the UK government&#x27;s recent decision not to legislate the controversial in-game monetisation system.


In a statement issued to Eurogamer, EA echoed many of its recent comments on Ultimate Team&#x27;s card packs, which have come under fire from children&#x27;s groups and researchers in recent years for their links to gambling, and from players for enabling pay-to-win in competitive modes.


&quot;We wholeheartedly believe that Ultimate Team and FUT Packs, which have been part of the game for more than a decade, are a part of FIFA that players love - fans love that the game reflects the real-world excitement and strategy of building and managing a squad. Giving players the choice to spend if they want to is fair,&quot; EA&#x27;s statement reads.

                              <span>Players can expect plenty of hip-hop in the Street Fighter 6 soundtrack as the game modernises the series, while honouring the past.


In an interview with Spin, producer Shuhei Matsumoto and lead composer Yoshiya Terayama discussed the musical influences on the next game.


&quot;Street Fighter 6 is very respectful of past works, such as the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2. We are taking on new challenges while honouring that foundation. Also, you can definitely expect hip hop. We put a lot of effort into how it sounds,&quot; said Matsumoto.

                              <span>Nintendo has been hit by a fresh worker complaint in the US, which a report suggests is due to the company&#x27;s response to labour activism. 


Both Nintendo of America and Aston Carter, a company Nintendo uses to recruit workers, have been referred to the National Labor Relations Board over the matter, which alleges that a worker suffered over the company&#x27;s &quot;coercive rules&quot;.


The complaint was first reported by Axios, which stated that allegations of this nature typically relate to cases where a worker claims a company has interfered with their right to unionise or discuss working conditions.

The trans Canadian streamer recounted the event in a YouTube video titled &quot;My life is in danger. I need your help&quot;, where she described being woken up by police officers pointing an assault rifle in her face at her home.


She was subsequently taken into police custody where she was accused of crimes she did not commit.

I&#x27;m sorry, I couldn&#x27;t resist. The latest Forspoken trailer was really asking for it though. 


Forspoken last made the headlines when its release date was pushed back from 11th October this year to 24th January 2023. It&#x27;s back again, though this time for a more light-hearted reason.

                              <span>Making Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox &quot;simply wouldn&#x27;t be profitable&quot;, Microsoft has said.


The claim comes as part of a fresh war of words between Xbox and PlayStation, as Microsoft seeks to finalise its eye-opening $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.


Specifically, it comes in response to Sony&#x27;s recent objections to the deal - in which it argued that Call of Duty could not be rivalled, and that the franchise was vitally important to PlayStation as it influenced players&#x27; choice of console.

To get access to the demo, you will need to have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. However, not everyone who has a Switch necessarily wants to subscribe to NSO. 
To negate this, Nintendo is offering everyone who downloads the demo a code that will give them a seven day trial of its subscription service.

                              <span>Following the introduction of government-mandated gaming restrictions, 54 percent of Chinese youth are reportedly playing games within regulated hours.


That&#x27;s according to a new 2022 China Youth Gamers report from Niko Partners (thanks GamesIndustry.biz).



The study found that 77 percent of youth are at least playing fewer hours per week, even though only 54 percent are within approved hours.

                              <span>When PowerWash Simulator came out of Early Access, it became quite a hit  amongst the team here at Eurogamer. I was curious to see whether I&#x27;d enjoy it too, so I cashed in the free month of Game Pass that came with my new PC to give it a try.


I enjoy it a lot. In the game&#x27;s career mode, there is no pressure to finish a level quickly or efficiently and that&#x27;s what I love about it. You can ignore the time and leave the hose running for as long as it takes you, and that&#x27;s all part of the appeal. Bertie expertly summed it up in his review.: &quot;This is not a game about rushing towards an end,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is a game about the sedate pleasures of repetitive work - a slower game about the satisfaction of a job well done. It&#x27;s relaxing and calming, and that&#x27;s a powerful quality.&quot; 


But this inevitably got me wondering about the other end of the gameplay spectrum in PowerWash Simulator. Speed and efficiency, rather than leisure. True, you can already play the game&#x27;s time-limited and water-limited modes, but they weren&#x27;t as extreme as what I was imagining. I&#x27;m talking speedwashing. Was there anyone out there playing like that?

                              <span>In a lengthy document submitted to the Brazilian government as part of its investigation into Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft has claimed Sony pays developers &quot;blocking rights&quot; to prevent games from appearing on Xbox Game Pass.


The accusation appears in a 27-page rebuttal of Sony&#x27;s recent objections to Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard buyout, made to Brazil&#x27;s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) as part of its investigation. Much of Sony&#x27;s argument had focused on Call of Duty - which it claimed had &quot;no rival&quot; and was &quot;so popular that it influences users&#x27; choice of console&quot; - with the PlayStation maker suggesting, among other things, that the inclusion of Call of Duty on Microsoft&#x27;s Game Pass service would hamper its ability to compete.


Microsoft&#x27;s response is as wide-ranging as Sony&#x27;s initial objections, touching on everything from the fact it has previously managed to grow Game Pass without Activision Blizzard&#x27;s titles - suggesting Call of Duty mightn&#x27;t be quite as &quot;essential&quot; as Sony claims - to a reiteration of its assurances that it won&#x27;t be making Call of Duty an Xbox console exclusive.

                              <span>Betrayal At Club Low - the latest jazz-infused odyssey from The Norwood Suite developer Cosmo D - finally has a release date, and will be swinging open its murderous doors for some woozily surreal adventure on 9th September.


Folding into the broader narrative of Cosmo D&#x27;s interconnected Off-Peak City games (so far consisting of 2015&#x27;s Off-Peak, 2017&#x27;s The Norwood Suite, and its 2020 follow-up Tales from Off-Peak City Vol. 1), Betrayal At Club Low sees players going undercover to attempt a rescue mission of sorts by infiltrating a &quot;deceptively dangerous&quot; nightclub/former coffin factory/&quot;haven for wild-limbed dancing, mind-altering music and shady characters&quot;.


While previous games in the series were largely focussed on relaxed roaming and light puzzling as players soaked up their deliciously off-kilter sensibilities, Betrayal at Club Low does things a little differently, drawing inspiration from &quot;short, punchy, independent zine RPGs&quot; in order to evoke the feel of a one-off tabletop session.

                              <span>A fan-made Half-Life 2 VR mod nearly eight years in the making will finally be getting a public release next month in the form of an open beta.


Eurogamer first reported on the Source VR Mod Team&#x27;s Half-Life 2: VR mod in 2017, but that version was actually an extension of an earlier mod released for Razer Hydra back in 2013. Some time after the new version&#x27;s announcement, the project appeared to stall - it entered &quot;its own kind of development hell and was all but abandoned&quot;, according to the team&#x27;s website - but it re-emerged in 2021 and is slowly approaching the finish line.


Half-Life 2: VR - one of several attempts to bring Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter sequel to virtual reality headsets - promises a range of features, including room scale VR, the ability to manipulate items and weapons directly with your hands, full locomotion, a weapon selection menu inspired by Valve&#x27;s Half-Life: Alyx, and tweaked vehicle rides intended to help reduce motion sickness.

                              <span>Xbox cloud streaming options advertised for Elden Ring and Grand Theft Auto 5 were a &quot;bug&quot;, Microsoft has told Eurogamer. 


Last night, fans spotted games such as Soul Hackers 2, GTA5 and Elden Ring were listed with an option to play via cloud streaming. Some speculated this was being rolled out now, in advance of a Gamescom announcement later this month.


But Microsoft has now said that the games&#x27; listings - which also flagged them as being part of Xbox Game Pass - were bugged, and that the issue has now been fixed.

                              <span>Technological constraints meant that the original Monkey Island game saw 25 percent of its dialogue text cut before it was released.


Talking to Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s Alanah Pearce, writer Tim Schafer revealed that The Secret of Monkey Island was originally too long and had to get some heavy editing. 


&quot;We were writing on Monkey Island, and we were told &#x27;you guys, we can&#x27;t go on six floppies. We have to go on five. We have too much text,&#x27;&quot; Schafer recalled before remarking how strange that sort of thing is to imagine now.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 just got a serious deep dive thanks to this afternoon&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, revealing new levels, new weapons and an all-new approach to Splatfests that will introduce three-way fights into the series for the first time. 


Three-way fights come as part of the returning Splatfests, with matches during the special timed events being split into two halves, with the first part a traditional 4v4 face-off while the second sees a 4v2v2 fight for territory. 


There&#x27;ll be a chance to sample this particular new flavour of Splatoon during a Splatfest World Premiere that&#x27;s taking place on 27th August - effectively a free demo where players can sample Splatoon 3 for a limited period, choosing to fight for rock, paper or scissors (it&#x27;s worth noting that the demo will be playable from 25th August , giving a small window for practice before the Splatfest World Premiere itself).

As a reminder, Microsoft is one of the few companies committed to Gamescom this year - and the only platform holder. Both Sony and Nintendo are sitting out the show&#x27;s big in-person return, alongside Activision Blizzard and Take-Two. 

Ubisoft, Bandai Namco and Embracer are among those also in attendance, though Assassin&#x27;s Creed fans are expecting all of Ubisoft&#x27;s big reveals to actually take place online, via a special event due in September.

                              <span>The big summer finale to Pokémon Go&#x27;s season of Go Fest events has been detailed in full. 


Due to take place on Saturday 27th August, this full-day event will cap off the game&#x27;s introduction of Ultra Beasts and (hopefully) see its hunky Professor Willow return after being left dramatically MIA.


The event has plenty for those playing free, or extras for those with a ticket. These premium bits are also included as part of the earlier Global Go Fest weekend back in June - so if you played that, you&#x27;re covered.

Gameplay details, screenshots and design documentation are all included in a post on the infamous GamingLeaksAndRumours reddit by user Purpletoaster20, who states that it is the culmination of &quot;months of research and discussion&quot; with those who knew about the mode before it was ditched.


The post also comes ahead of a 30-minute video on the mode, which the user says they intend to post online next week.

In a blog post on the event, Blizzard noted that its loot boxes have a chance to contain rare items from previous Anniversary and seasonal events, and told fans not to &quot;wait too long to snag those skins you&#x27;ve been eyeing for the past year&quot;.

Yesterday he was added to the Public Test Build of the game, giving us a first look at his arsenal of abilities.

We already knew the Seething Bazelguese and Lucent Nargacuga would be arriving as part of Sunbreak&#x27;s first post-launch update, but Capcom has now revealed two more additions in the form of the Silver Rathalos and Gold Rathian, with all four becoming available at Master Rank 10.

                              <span>Bulkhead, the Derby-based developer of old-school WW2 shooter Battalion 1944, has announced a &quot;formal end&quot; to its relationship with Square Enix. 


The Final Fantasy publisher purchased a 20 percent stake of Bulkhead back in 2018, and announced plans for a fresh project at the studio. 


Today also brings a long-awaited update on Battalion itself, which will get an &quot;overhauled, final update&quot; and name change to Battalion: Legacy on 16th August, when it will also be made available for free via Steam.

                              <span>New footage showing off a white version of the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller has made its way online. 


This footage shared by YouTuber Nicholas Lugo and spotted by Twitter user Rebs Gaming (via VGC), shows Lugo unboxing what they claim to be the &quot;only white Xbox Elite in the United States&quot;.


While the video doesn&#x27;t go into any more details, such as how Lugo happens to have this mythical controller in their possession, it does all seem to be genuine. It even has the controller&#x27;s soft shell case.

Throughout the game, and as the name suggests, there will be a variety of treasures for players to uncover. This includes smaller items, known as &quot;bric-a-brac&quot;, which will glow with a silvery aura when you come up to them. 
You will also see your monster companions getting excited, and little speech bubbles will appear above their heads when they know you are in the vicinity of some goodies.

Booth streamed a &quot;quick AMA&quot; video on Twitch (ironically, six hours long) in which a fan asked if the duo were involved in Metroid Prime&#x27;s music (thanks VGC).


Both Booth and his musical partner Rob Brown appear in the credits of the 2002 game, sparking much speculation as to their involvement.

                              <span>Two lead developers on Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition have detailed some of the factors that led to the game&#x27;s disappointing state upon release.


Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition released on 23rd June, and received a negative reaction from critics and fans alike. The controversy didn&#x27;t end there, with many also unhappy about the delisting of the fan-made ScummVM version of the original game on GOG. The ScummVM version, seen as vastly superior to Nightdive&#x27;s remaster, was subsequently reinstated a week later, and was also then packaged with the Enhanced Edition on Steam. 


Now, Nightdive Studio director of business development Larry Kuperman and lead producer on Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition Dimitris Giannakis have discussed the troubled development of the project with PCGamesN.

                              <span>Take-Two has talked bullishly of its hopes for the success of Grand Theft Auto 6, amidst a mixed picture of financial results. 


Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick blamed a &quot;softer economy&quot; for a downturn in revenue for both halves of the now-combined Take-Two and mobile giant Zynga. 


The now-completed buyout has also left a $117m hole in the company&#x27;s bottom line due to business acquisition costs.

                              <span>David Cage has responded to allegations of unhealthy studio culture and inappropriate behaviour at Quantic Dream, which he previously described as a &quot;smear campaign&quot;.



Published in this month&#x27;s Edge Magazine, Cage discusses in depth the company culture of the studio and denies a lack of humility in its response to allegations.


&quot;I don&#x27;t think we had an aggressive attitude,&quot; he said. &quot;When you&#x27;re accused of things that go against everything you believe in, everything you&#x27;ve done in your life, it hurts. It went beyond just attacking the studio culture.

To put that into perspective, that is less than one percent of users.


According to Apptopia (via CNBC), Netflix&#x27;s game offerings have only been downloaded a total of 23.3m times since the company&#x27;s foray into this market.

Sonic, Tails and Knuckles will return to a big screen near you on 20th December 2024. 


Fun fact for film fans - that&#x27;s the same day as Avatar 3, the sequel to the upcoming Avatar sequel that&#x27;s not even out yet.

                              <span>Purveyors of video game secrets have something new to get excited about following the recent fuss around Nier: Automata&#x27;s ultimately rather underwhelming church mystery; a hidden two-player mode has been uncovered in Super Punch-Out!!, 28 years after its release on the SNES.


As explained by Unlisted Cheats - a Twitter account specialising in video game &quot;secrets nobody heard about until now&quot; - the discovery was made &quot;while doing some request work&quot; on Super Punch-Out and has revealed two additional cheat codes on top of the sound test and Japanese name input cheats previously known.


The first cheat unlocks a stage select screen enabling players to take on any fighter, including Special Circuit fighters, in a free single match. This can be accessed from Super Punch-Out&#x27;s title screen by holding down Y and R on Controller 2 and then hitting A or Start on Controller 1.

                              <span>2K has announced a second delay for developer Firaxis&#x27; Marvel-themed tactical RPG Midnight Suns. The title will no longer launch this October as previously annouced and will instead now arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC at some point before the end of 2K&#x27;s current fiscal year. Other versions are now &quot;TBA&quot;.


Announced last August, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is superhero strategy game that - drawing inspiration from the Midnight Sons comic book run of the mid-90s - follows a roster of familiar faces, including the Avengers, on an adventure that blends card-battling turn-based combat and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building.


It was originally due to launch this March, but last November saw Firaxis and 2K make the decision to push its release back toward the end of 2022 in order to &quot;add more story, cinematics and overall polish&quot;. June then bought the news that the end was almost in sight, with the game receiving a launch date of 7th October.

                              <span>With Hollywood&#x27;s hunger for video game adaptations still seemingly insatiable, it&#x27;s now Bandai Namco&#x27;s turn to get in on the action, shunting Pac-Man - arguing gaming&#x27;s most iconic mascot - onto the the big screen in a live-action movie adaptation.


That&#x27;s according to the Hollywood Reporter, which says Bandai Namco is teaming up with Wayfarer Studios (the company behind Disney+ biopic Clouds) to bring Pac-Man to cinemas.


Details are limited right now, but the movie is said to be based on an original idea by Chuck Williams, who&#x27;ll produce alongside Tim Kwok on behalf of Lightbeam Entertainment.

A new Sonic/Fall Guys collaboration was, of course, officially announced during June&#x27;s Sonic Central livestream. However, all Sega was saying at the time was that the game&#x27;s previously released Sonic and Knuckles skins would be returning this August alongside a new addition - Tails - as part of the hedgehog&#x27;s 30th Anniversreay celbrations.


Since then, data miners have discovered Fall Guys developer Mediatonic and Sega might have something a little more substantial planned than mere skins, with a special Green Hill Zone inspired stage having recently been discovered squirrelled away in the files.

The co-op sci-fi shooter was revealed at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, but the release has been pushed back due to the ambitions of the team, led by former EA exec Patrick Söderlund.



&quot;We&#x27;ve made the decision to delay Arc Raiders to 2023,&quot; reads a statement on Twitter.

                              <span>FIFA 23 fuses Pro Clubs and Volta progression, EA Sports has confirmed.


Pro Clubs mode, a competitive 11v11 mode in which players control a single player as part of a club, has always been separate from Volta, a mode seen as a spiritual successor of sorts to the tricks and customisation-focused FIFA Street series.


In a presentation attended by Eurogamer, EA Sports developers insisted both Pro Clubs and Volta fit together.

                              <span>A potential feature which allows players to share their battle pass progress may come to Warner Bros.&#x27; MultiVersus in the future.


That&#x27;s according to AisulMV on Twitter, who found that a &#x27;Find a Battle Pass Partner&#x27; screen existed within the game&#x27;s files (thanks, VGC). 


AisulMV stated this feature was for &quot;battle pass linking&quot;, and may be introduced alongside season one (which, in case you missed it, has been delayed).

                              <span>At Evo 2022, Capcom introduced us all to Kimberly, the first female African American fighter to come to its Street Fighter series.


Kimberly has a moveset that makes the most of &quot;traditional ninja techniques&quot; but with an added &quot;urban twist&quot;. This includes a rather creative use of spray cans and her &quot;trusty portable cassette player&quot;. As you would expect, this girl can pack a punch!


Along with Kimberly, Juri will also make her return on Street Fighter 6&#x27;s release. Apparently she will be &quot;as wicked as ever&quot;, with a moveset that will be both new and yet still reassuringly familiar. You can see the ladies&#x27; full reveal below.

It seems these stem from an ongoing Friend and Family beta version of the game, which is labelled as a &quot;private test build&quot;. 


Images and video currently circulating show the game&#x27;s title screen, character customisation and other initial options, such as game creation and difficulty selection.

The brand new mod from Garden of Eyes adds gun parrying to the game, inspired by the same mechanic in Bloodborne.


The mod makes the Soldier&#x27;s Pistol and Tarnished Bullets available in crafting, which can be shot to counter enemy attacks. Yes, that includes bosses like Malenia.

                              <span>An Elden Ring fan has recreated one of the game&#x27;s Walking Mausoleums out of Lego.

The builder, known as HoboSapient, shared their creation on reddit, spotted by PC Gamer.

And he hasn&#x27;t come alone. Doomguy has also joined the fray, just to beat up Master Chief.


God of Console War footage was posted last week on YouTube by modder MarcosRC. Watch them go up against each other in the game&#x27;s final battle below, with Master Chief replacing Kratos and Doomguy taking over for Baldur.

                              <span>Blizzard is doing what it can to alleviate any concerns its community may have about microtransactions in Overwatch 2.

This follows on from the news that the company is ditching its predecessor&#x27;s lootboxes in favour of a seasonal battle pass and in-game store.

As shared by Twitter user Portergauge, earlier this year Blizzard asked those taking part in the Overwatch 2 beta their thoughts on paying $45 for the new, highest rarity, skin in the upcoming sequel.

The Marina Bay Grand Prix map is inspired by the Singapore F1 street circuit of the same name, but with a much darker tone of course.


The open beta will take place across two weekends, with PlayStation players able to access the first exclusively.

The scene then cuts to a close-up of a new model of Kazuya doing the same smile, before the teaser tells us all to &quot;get ready&quot;. You can see it for yourself at the end of the clip below.


This brief preview of things to come was then quickly reshared by The Game Awards Twitter account.

                              <span>The mysterious new Call of Duty Warzone will be revealed next month on 15th September, as part of a presentation which publisher Activision has bombastically described as an &quot;era-defining livestream franchise event&quot;.


The livestream, dubbed Call of Duty Next, will also fully reveal the multiplayer mode featured in the upcoming Modern Warfare 2, and additionally feature Warzone on mobile.


But its Warzone 2.0, or whatever it ends up being called, that is the most intriguing part of this year&#x27;s Call of Duty offerings. This is the refreshed version of Activision&#x27;s COD battle royale that we know won&#x27;t carry over much of your progress - and sounds like it will be an entirely separate entity.

                              <span>Quantum computing is a completely new paradigm for computers. A quantum computer uses quantum properties such as superposition, which allows a qubit (a quantum bit) to be neither 0 nor 1, but something much more complicated. In theory, such a computer can solve problems too complex for conventional computers.
Current quantum computers are still toy prototypes, and the engineering advances required to build a functionally useful quantum computer are somewhere between a few years away and impossible. Even so, we already know that that such a computer could potentially factor large numbers and compute discrete logs, and break the RSA and Diffie-Hellman public-key algorithms in all of the useful key sizes...</span>

                              <span>More than half of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s revenue came from mobile games in April - June (Q2) 2022.

According to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s most recent financial report, the developer/publisher generated £535m from its PC and console sales in Q2 2022 - £275m ($332m) on PC and £310m ($376m) consoles - while £688m ($831m) came from its &quot;mobile and ancillary&quot; business, which the company says &quot;primarily include[s] revenues from mobile devices&quot;. That&#x27;s more than 50 per cent of its entire net revenue for the period. 

Part of this, of course, is because Activision acquired mobile developer King in 2016 - and right now, it&#x27;s the most successful part of ABK&#x27;s business - but it&#x27;s likely not coincidental that Diablo Immortal released during this period, too (thanks, PC Gamer).

As first reported by Ars Technica, the &quot;interactive NFTs&quot; of the NiFTy Arcade collection were being minted and sold without the creators&#x27; permission, &quot;much less any arrangement for the creators to share in any crypto profits&quot;.

GameStop has since confirmed that the person behind NiFTy Arcade has been suspended, but Ars reports that he is still &quot;holding onto the tends of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency he made by selling those NFTs before the suspension&quot;. Furthermore, the unlicensed games are also still fully accessible from GameStop&#x27;s servers.

The annual music festival is held each summer in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, but this is the first time the classical music festival has featured a concert dedicated to game music.

The event - titled Gaming Prom – From 8-Bit to Infinity - took place earlier this week, hosted by BBC gaming reporter Steffan Powell and Louise Blain, who hosts the excellent Sound of Gaming podcast on BBC Sounds.

                              <span>PUBG developer Krafton has announced it&#x27;s making a new game based upon the Korean fantasy book, The Bird That Drinks Tears.

Krafton says it is an &quot;ambitious project&quot; that &quot;aims to bring the original fantasy universe of The Bird That Drinks Tears to life through its unique and refreshing fantasy races, beautiful, haunting landscapes, and gripping, immersive, and poignant stories&quot;.

&quot;The Bird That Drinks Tears is a novel series that was created and written by Yeong-do Lee, who is widely acknowledged as the pioneer of the Korean fantasy genre,&quot; Krafton explains. &quot;As one of the best-selling fantasy authors in Korea with millions of copies sold, Mr. Lee is an exceptionally imaginative writer who builds elaborate worlds and fills them with complex characters.&quot;

It includes a new MP9 weapon - the first fully-automatic SMG that uses 9mm - a new vehicle that will see you &quot;zipping down roads with sirens ablaze&quot; (so not for the stealthy, it seems), and the Blue Chip Detector tactical gear which uses primary weapon slots but can be used to scan for enemies within a 100m radius; you&#x27;ll see the nearest 12 enemies on the map.

We&#x27;ll also get our collective hands on the brand-new 1500hp Folding Shield and &quot;once again have the opportunity to drop onto the Haven map&quot;. The update also brings &quot;familiar foes&quot; from the recently-announced Assassin&#x27;s Creed season.

In the past, the DEEPEND crew has discovered three new species of Bathyteuthids, a type of squid that lives in depths between 700 and 2,000 meters. The findings were validated and published in 2020. Another new squid species description is currently in review at the Bulletin of Marine Science.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise, in both its Switch and PC forms, is fab - Eurogamer called it &quot;as good as video games can get&quot; - and its Sunbreak expansion is perhaps even better. More, then, is an extremely welcome proposition, and we&#x27;ll soon know exactly what&#x27;s in store for Sunbreak&#x27;s first major post-launch update when it&#x27;s newly announced livestream airs next week.


Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s incoming digital event will be hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and game director Yoshitake Suzuki, with proceedings due to begin on Twitch next Tuesday, 9th August, at 3pm BST/7am PDT.


Capcom has already teased a little of what&#x27;s to come in August&#x27;s Title Update 1, with the Seething Bazelguese and Lucent Nargacuga (from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate respectively) both confirmed as new monster additions to the line-up, while the Forlorn Arena will be added as a new locale.

                              <span>Sega has released another round of fixes for Sonic Origins - the publisher&#x27;s disappointing collection of classic Sonic platformers - this time taking aim at Sonic the Hedgehog 2&#x27;s troublesome Tails AI.


Sonic Origins was, to put it politely, a bit of a mess when it launched earlier this year, and was plagued by enough presentational and technical issues - as extensively documented by Digital Foundry&#x27;s John Linneman - that its developer publicly hit out at Sega, saying it was &quot;very unhappy&quot; at the state the game had been launched in. 


Since then, Sega has been working to fix some of Origins&#x27; more egregious problems, and its latest patch - officially known as update 1.04 - leads with an attempt to remedy a widely reported AI issue that would repeatedly cause Tails to goes off-screen in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, unable to rejoin the action.

                              <span>Valve continues to tinker behind the scenes with Steam and its latest client beta has officially introduced support for Nintendo&#x27;s Switch Joy-Con controllers.


As such, those with a preference for Nintendo&#x27;s dual-handed clutch capsules will now be able to use them across their PC games in a number of different configurations.


There&#x27;s support for individual Joy-Cons, which can be used as mini gamepad, and two controllers can also be combined into pairs - as is the case on Switch - for a more traditional controller configuration.

Background: one of my favourite video game stories of 2021 was the time when Jota had to quit a FIFA 22 tournament early to play a real-life match that afternoon - and performed a gamer celebration after scoring after just 97 seconds.


Jota celebrated by sitting down and pretending to play FIFA. (Jota continued his impressive form in front of goal by adding a second goal later in the first half. Liverpool went on to win 4-0.)

                              <span>Back in 2018, Belgium declared loot boxes in games were a form of gambling and therefore illegal, but it appears this law isn&#x27;t being enforced.


Loot box researcher Leon Y Xiao has written a report stating the country&#x27;s gambling law regulation of video game loot boxes has been ineffective, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz.


Despite the ban, paid loot boxes remained widespread in the top 100 grossing iPhone games in Belgium from 2021, with 82 percent including some form of random monetisation mechanic.

&quot;Hundreds of additional megabytes of memory are now available to Xbox Series S developers,&quot; explained the game dev team in a new video (see below) all about the GDK&#x27;s updates (thanks, The Verge). 


Microsoft says this will give developers &quot;more control over memory&quot;, and as such will allow for &quot;[improved] graphics performance in memory-constrained conditions.&quot; So, good news indeed.

Speaking to Rock, Paper, Shotgun, senior narrative designer Philip Lawrence said the decision to launch last year&#x27;s entry True Colors as a complete experience was &quot;the right decision&quot;, and one the studio wanted to stick with.


&quot;I can&#x27;t imagine we&#x27;d go back to the episodic model,&quot; Lawrence said. &quot;The reaction has been very positive.&quot;

                              <span>Ahead of its release this September, Naughty Dog has been slowly sharing little snippets from The Last of Us Part 1 for PlayStation 5 and comparing it to the PS4 Remastered edition of the game.


The latest example of this sees Joel on horseback, as the screen slides between the PS4 and PS5 versions of the same scene.


&quot;Get ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful - and dangerous - journey across America in The Last of Us Part 1,&quot; Naughty Dog proclaimed in its tweet with the footage, which you can see below.

                              <span>Yesterday Square Enix officially announced the forthcoming release of Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the PSP remake of SNES game Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together.


However, some fans are unhappy with both graphical changes and the cost of the remake.


The pixel art of the original has been smoothed out which gives a rounded effect, while the text has been sharpened with a new font.

Dataminer AndyReloads has already filmed himself strutting around like Iron Man in a new suit of armour that lets you wield a chest laser akin to Stark&#x27;s own arc reactor. 


The design of the armour, and especially the colouring, are obviously Iron Man-themed. But - thankfully - you&#x27;re not actually Iron Man, and the rest of the design bears resemblence to those warn by the series&#x27; technological Isu race.

                              <span>Square Enix has released its latest financial results, detailing a rise in MMO sales thanks to Final Fantasy 14 despite an overall decline.
However, comments have also emerged from an internal conference call concerning the financial report, courtesy of analyst David Gibson.


The sale of Square Enix&#x27;s western studios - notably Crystal Dynamics and Eidos - was &quot;driven by concerns that the titles cannibalised sales of the rest of the group&quot;, with the company aiming to improve capital efficiency.

Following on from the recent release of patch 0.9, developer Poncle has now released patch 0.10.0 for the game, or in its words, &quot;The Not One&quot; patch. You can see a teaser for it below.


This patch brings with it a host of new content, such as new characters Cosmo Pavone and Big Trousers. Players will also now be able to get two new achievements, a new Arcana and a new weapon.

Total net sales from the last financial quarter (April to June) were 74.8bn yen, a drop of almost 16 percent compared to the same period last year, while operating income was 14.4bn yen, a drop of almost 17 percent. Net income actually rose due to foreign exchange gains.


However, while net sales of HD games has declined year on year, sales of MMO games have conversely risen year on year.

Even better - for those of us who like peeking inside our Christmas presents a little early - these files line up with a previous leak which appeared to identify the specific platforms for each upcoming DLC course. 


Now, fans have put together what they think is a schedule for the remaining DLC cups, including all of the tracks from Wave 3, expected later this year.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to March and you might recall reports claiming Microsoft was working on a new family plan for Game Pass. Those reports, it now transpires, were true, and an Insider Preview test of the new scheme is available now in an extremely limited number of countries.


As detailed in a new Microsoft blog post, the Xbox Insider trial version of the scheme will enable anyone with a special Insider Preview Game Pass plan to invite up to four people to share that subscription, with each one then gaining unique access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&#x27;s full selection of games, content, and benefits.


The immediate catch right now is that the test is only available to those in Colombia and Ireland. And while the people being added to a subscription by Insiders don&#x27;t need to be an Insider themselves, they do need a Microsoft account and must be in the same country.

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s announcement that Frogwares - the developer behind the likes of Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One and The Sinking City - is remaking its 2007 Sherlock/Lovecraft crossover The Awakened, the studio has released a first cinematic trailer for the project, which is seeking Kickstarter funding right now.


The Awakened, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was the third instalment in a series of Frogwares-developed Sherlock Holmes investigatory adventures that has so far spanned nine games, pitting the Baker Street detective against Cthulhu cults and eldritch abominations across Victorian London, Switzerland, New Orleans, and the Scottish Highlands.


Frogwares&#x27; remake will see the studio reimagining the title for modern audiences, drawing on its learning from the more recent Sherlock games, and retooling its story to be a continuation of the young Sherlock arc, which started in last year&#x27;s Chapter One. And if you&#x27;re curious to know how that might look, the developer has you covered with a new cinematic trailer in which Sherlock and Watson traverse the New Orleans bayous into a strange realm  that, pleasingly, looks to share more than a few aesthetic beats with Frogwares&#x27; Lovecraftian The Sinking City.

                              <span>Crypt of the Necrodancer, the acclaimed rhythm-based dungeon-crawler from Brace Yourself Games, has - following its first update in five years last month - launched a huge new expansion, titled Synchrony, into Steam early access, bringing new characters, online multiplayer, and more. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, there&#x27;s also some sort of sequel or spin-off on the way.


Getting the latter part of the announcement out of the way first, as details are currently rather limited, the follow-up is called Rift of the Necrodancer and is described as &quot;new standalone rhythm game in the Necrodancer universe.&quot; Exactly what form it&#x27;ll take is currently unclear, but Brace Yourself says to &quot;stay tuned&quot; for more details.


Thankfully, if it&#x27;s details you want, Crypt of the Necrodancer&#x27;s newly released Synchrony DLC delivers in spades, arriving alongside an absolutely enormous set of release notes. To summarise though, it brings three new characters, new enemies, new items, online multiplayer, a new Versus mode, full mod support, plus a stack of DLC-exclusive features.

The ability to pet your pets in a rogue-like action-platformer mightn&#x27;t be at the top of your own personal list of exciting additions, but - as revealed in Evil Empire&#x27;s extremely extensive release notes - the feature is now in, giving players the ability to show their companions some love between biomes. And why wouldn&#x27;t you want to do that, you monster?


Elsewhere, the free Panchaku update introduces the new Panchaku weapon, which keen-eyed players might recognise as originating in the animated trailer for Dead Cells&#x27; Bad Seed expansion. It&#x27;s described as &quot;two frying pans tied together with a piece of string, which crits on enemies facing you and has a slick combo with hits behind and all around you&quot;. It&#x27;ll also reflect bombs and projectiles mid-combo.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we&#x27;re talking Pokémon, following the franchise&#x27;s huge announcement livestream that divulged fresh details on upcoming games Scarlet and Violet. 


The star of that show? Well, obviously it was Fidough - a freshly-baked dog  Pokémon made of bread, whose popularity has now set the internet ablaze. But, dear viewer, we have questions. If Fidough is bread... can you eat it? Should you eat it? Why wouldn&#x27;t you eat it? And how does it evolve?


Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss all of this and show off our own two-minute art challenge concepts for whatever Fidough evolves into, while pondering how it might taste.

                              <span>With Apex Legends&#x27; 14th season coming in fast and its pre-launch promotional push in full swing,developer Respawn Entertainment has shared further details on new hero Vantage - this time focusing on her abilities - ahead of her arrival next Tuesday, 9th August.


Vantage was officially unveiled as Apex Legends&#x27; 22nd hero at the end of July, in a new Stories from the Outlands video introducing her as a young hunter on the snowy planet of Págos. Adding a sport of drama to her backstory, her mother is an escaped prisoner (wrongly convicted) who was forced to turn herself in after Vantage was badly injured in an accident.


With that lore dump out the way, Respawn has now turned its attention to detailing what Vantage will bring to Apex Legends in gameplay terms, revealing her abilities to be based around two core elements: her sniper rifle and her bat-like companion Echo.

That&#x27;s right, Wii classic Coconut Mall has been fixed, so the Shy Guy-driven cars at the end of the course are no longer static.


Bizarrely, however, rather than just move back and forth as they did in the Wii original, the vehicles now pull off doughnuts. I&#x27;m not sure this was an improvement.

                              <span>A Twitch streamer has achieved the impossible by completing the $20,000 (£16,400) Halo 2 challenge.


The challenge, set earlier this year by streamer Charlie &quot;Cr1tikal&quot; White, was that someone had to complete the entirety of the Halo 2 Anniversary campaign without dying on Legendary difficulty, with all &quot;Skull&quot; modifiers on. 


The effect of the modifiers range from increasing the health of enemies to all enemies being permanently cloaked. The only modifier that must be kept off is &quot;Envy&quot; skull, which replaces Master Chief&#x27;s torch with an active camouflage system (because that would make things too easy).

                              <span>Rumours suggest EA is currently working on a new Iron Man video game.


Earlier this year, Jeff Grubb reported that a Black Panther game was in the works with EA. Now, the loose-lipped journalist has shared that another Marvel project is also underway with the company.


Chatting as part of Giant Bomb&#x27;s Game Mess Mornings stream, Grubb stated: &quot;[EA is] making that Black Panther game we spoke about... and [it&#x27;s] making another Marvel game that&#x27;s single player&quot;. This comment was said in a rather throw away manner, but, of course, it was quickly picked up by the internet.

That&#x27;s according to a new Nikkei (paywall) report, which follows up on Nintendo&#x27;s latest financial results issued earlier this week. 


During those results, Nintendo said it faced manufacturing issues due to component shortages. Speaking to Nikkei, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that sorting these was now Nintendo&#x27;s immediate goal.

It was just broken, really badly.
We present an efficient key recovery attack on the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie­-Hellman protocol (SIDH), based on a “glue-and-split” theorem due to Kani. Our attack exploits the existence of a small non-scalar endomorphism on the starting curve, and it also relies on the auxiliary torsion point information that Alice and Bob share during the protocol. Our Magma implementation breaks the instantiation SIKEp434, which aims at security level 1 of the Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process currently ran by NIST, in about one hour on a single core...</span>

As Kubernetes grows and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with improvements for the health of the project. Kubernetes v1.25 includes several major changes and one major removal.
The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed.

                              <span>With NBA 2K23&#x27;s 9th September release date rapidly approaching, publisher 2K has shared a closer look at this latest series instalment&#x27;s new features - including a new trailer - playing up the concept of &quot;authenticity&quot; across its defensive and offensive tool kit.


It&#x27;s an extensive list of new features, as detailed in a lengthy new blog post, with 2K saying this year&#x27;s gameplay changes should &quot;should translate to more wins, and more seamless actions&quot;.


On the offensive side of things, there are new gesture combos to the Pro Stick, which 2K says has allowed it to &quot;expand the dunking controls to let you dunk exactly how you want&quot;. That includes the addition of a new rim hang control which, on new gen consoles, incorporates physics-based simulated rim hangs.

This was the company&#x27;s first ever showcase, streamed live on Twitch and YouTube.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive has revealed its next game: Meet Your Maker.


It&#x27;s a first-person building and raiding game that takes place in a hellish, post-apocalyptic wasteland, with players building towering industrial outposts filled with traps to protect genetic material - and then infiltrating the outposts of others to steal the precious resource.


It certainly feels like a departure from the popular horror multiplayer game, both in its genre and its aesthetic. But there are more similarities than you might think.

Halfbrick - also the studio responsible for mobile classic Fruit Ninja - initially announced an iOS and Android sequel to Jetpack Joyride back in February 2021, with an accompanying trailer suggesting some very familiar action, albeit with a slightly slicker new HD art style.


That announcement was accompanied by a limited launch in select territories, but Halfbrick suddenly pulled the game from Google Play and the iOS App Store in March this year, saying it had &quot;entered a new closed phase of development for an indefinite period&quot;.

The Pokémon Company had already announced the Pokémon Centre pop-up store will be returning to London, but hadn&#x27;t given away any details on what new Pikachu design will be appearing. Images of the plushies have now been released, via today&#x27;s Pokémon livestream.
The previous pop-up store in 2018 had Pikachu suited up and topped off with a bowler hat, and was so popular the store ended up having to limit purchases and opening hours in order to cope with demand. This time, Pikachu has an even more iconic London look.

The only two categories that did not see a decline in the mobile gaming market were tabletop and arcade games.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard and Chinese publisher NetEase have reportedly cancelled an unannounced World of Warcraft MMO following a disagreement between the two parties.


As reported by Bloomberg, the unannounced project - internally known as Neptune and in development for three years - wasn&#x27;t a direct adaptation of the existing WoW MMO, but rather an MMORPG spin-off set in the same universe but during a different time period.


However, despite the project&#x27;s already lengthy development period, NetEase is now said to have disbanded its creative team - consisting of more than 100 developers - after a disagreement with Activision Blizzard &quot;over financial terms&quot; resulted in both parties pulling the plug.

But alas, the Stray modding community continues to give, and I am therefore compelled to continue cataloguing their work (see, that one wasn&#x27;t even noticeable! That wasn&#x27;t painful now, was it?).


First up, there&#x27;s another mod for the dog lovers among us, thanks to MrMarco1003, this time with Bolt from the titular Disney movie. The mod also changes Stray&#x27;s meows into barks, and you&#x27;ll get to see Bolt chilling out with his identically-shaped fur-iends at the beginning of the game. 


With the dog lovers placated, let&#x27;s move onto the modifications for us cat lovers.

                              <span>A dedicated Sonic fan has taken the Sega Game Gear&#x27;s Triple Trouble release and given it a 16-bit reimagining.
&quot;What if Sonic Triple Trouble had been originally released on the Sega Genesis / MegaDrive, after Sonic 3 and Knuckles,&quot; asked fan game developer Noah Copeland. Well, Copeland not only asked this question, but they also answered it.
After releasing a demo for their creation several years ago, yesterday saw Copeland&#x27;s passion project fully realised (thanks, The Deleter).

                              <span>Over the weekend, a leak with potential details of the next Tomb Raider game made its way around the internet. These details came from an audition script for a role in the game, and told of Lara Croft leading a team of younger tomb raiders as she deals with the isolation of success. 


Now, Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has issued a DMCA takedown notice to the Sacred Symbols Patreon, which leaked the audition script in question - and in doing so pretty much verified the details as accurate. 


Sacred Symbols has since released a video about this takedown, saying the company had &quot;[forced] our hand&quot; on the matter.

                              <span>Settle down into your Snorlax bean bag and pop down the hood of your Pikachu onesie. Today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents presentation - a Pokémon-focused Nintendo Direct - is due to broadcast today at 2pm UK time.
We&#x27;re expecting around 20 minutes of announcements and footage, including a deeper dive into this year&#x27;s highly-anticipated Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, due for Nintendo Switch in time for Christmas. (Stand by for more Lechonk!)
These shows typically pack in updates on other Pokémon spin-offs too, so expect a brief mention of things like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Go or Pokémon Cafe Mix. And finally, after years of waiting will we finally hear more about Pokémon Sleep?

                              <span>Nintendo Switch exclusive Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has earned the biggest UK launch yet for the series, in terms of boxed sales figures. 


But the critically-acclaimed RPG missed out on becoming the franchise&#x27;s most lucrative launch to date - largely because it launched without its more-expensive Definitive Edition, GamesIndustry.biz reported.


As you may recall, the extra contents of Xenoblade Chronicles 3&#x27;s Definitive Edition are now slated for launch later this year, due to &quot;unforeseen logistical challenges&quot;.

                              <span>Elden Ring has been heavily criticised for its performance issues, particularly its PC iteration.


That&#x27;s why one modder has taken matters into their own hands and taken drastic measures: chopping down the Erdtree.


For the unfamiliar, the Ertree is the giant golden tree that not only dominates the world with its shimmering branches, but dominates the narrative and the lives of the inhabitants in The Lands Between.

                              <span>NFL team the LA Rams may be feeling a little sheepish this morning. 


Following an event that allowed the team early access to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, several images and snippets from the game have made their way onto the internet. You could say, these leaks are ram-pant.


The first image shows off the game&#x27;s upcoming multiplayer lobby, which you can see in the tweet below. This image was originally shared by NFL player Cameron Dicker, although they clearly realised the error of their ways and swiftly removed the shot from their socials. This is the internet, however, and of course once it was out there, the Call of Duty community got wind of it and saved it for posterity.

The new version of SteamOS has plenty of new features as well as bug fixes.


Following Valve&#x27;s warning a couple of weeks ago about the Steam Deck&#x27;s performance in high temperatures,  temperature notifications have been added which warn you when the console goes outside of the safe operating range. Fashionably late to the heatwave, but handy for anyone who&#x27;s enjoying the last of the summer time.

&quot;We are investigating the attack and taking countermeasures. Additional information will be provided as the situation develops,&quot; reads the post.

                              <span>Nintendo has blamed component shortages for a further slowing of Switch hardware sales, which have impacted the company&#x27;s overall sales and profit for the past financial quarter. 


It&#x27;s not all bad news, however. Switch game sales remain brisk, with more games sold to consumers year-on-year and a solid start for Nintendo Switch Sports (which has now notched up 4.84m copies).


Nintendo highlighted several other first-party games to have sold well over the past three months: Mario Strikers Battle League shifted 1.91m copies, while Kirby and the Forgotten Land sold another 1.88m, taking it to a total of 4.53m and making it the best-selling Kirby game ever.

                              <span>EA&#x27;s CEO Andrew Wilson has stated the importance of single player games, despite multiplayer games dominating the company&#x27;s output.


During the company&#x27;s first quarter earnings call yesterday, Wilson was asked how single player games fit into its portfolio.


He described them as &quot;really, really important&quot;, although chief financial officer Chris Suh also followed up noting that live service games account for over 70 percent of the total business.

The league is home to some of the biggest football clubs in the world, such as Real Madrid and Barcelona.


The sponsorship deal, which Marca reports will cost EA €30m euros a year, will include &quot;title-naming rights for all La Liga competitions&quot; and a &quot;complete rebrand of La Liga with EA Sports including all logos, graphics, fonts and other visual elements&quot;.

                              <span>A cheap and god awful God of War rip-off has been made available to buy on the Xbox store. 


It&#x27;s called War Gods Zeus of Child, is priced £3.39, and lets you jankily control God of War hero Kratos. 


Having bought the game and played it myself, I can tell you it is a worthless, minutes-long experience where you make Kratos slash aimlessly at a never-ending stream of enemies in an arena environment, until you give up or Kratos dies.

                              <span>Yes, E3 was cancelled this year, but do not fear. Another show has appeared.


Rising from the grave of E3 is EEK3, an annual indie showcase organised by Haunted PS1.


As the name would suggest, Haunted PS1 is a community dedicated to indie games that are reviving the 90s era of gaming with weird and uncanny aesthetics. EEK3 in particular focuses on retro horror games and has a penchant for the low-fi, low-poly offerings its community brings.

                              <span>Xbox has announced the next batch of games coming to its Game Pass subscription service this August.


Available from today is Ghost Recon Wildlands on cloud, console and PC, the Tom Clancy co-op military shooter from 2017 - we called it &quot;beautiful yet callous&quot; in our review.



The remaining games coming soon are headed up by Two Point Campus, the latest sim game from the makers of Two Point Hospital. It&#x27;s out day one on 9th August across cloud, console, and PC and judging from our preview will be well worth playing.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal has stemmed the flow of falling Blizzard user numbers, and given the company a modest increase in monthly active engagement. 


However, Activision Blizzard&#x27;s latest financial results show Blizzard active users have only recovered slightly - to where they were just over a year ago - and revenue remains down slightly year-on-year. 


After falling to 22 million monthly active users for the quarter ending in March 2022, Diablo Immortal has helped Blizzard back to 27 million for the quarter ending at the beginning of July.

That&#x27;s according to Joseph Staten, head of creative at 343 Industries, speaking on the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences podcast Game Maker&#x27;s Notebook (thanks TechRadar).

                              <span>A recent update for Hitman 3 added the tropical Ambrose Island map to the game. This map has a piratical theme, and so it is only fitting that Guybrush Threepwood from the Monkey Island series makes a showing on its shores.


Please note that there will be some spoilers for Hitman 3&#x27;s Ambrose Island map below.


If you venture down from the Western Beach on Ambrose Island, you will come across a small nook in the coastline. Here, there is a gravestone set into the side of the cliff face.

Polfeldt was managing director of Ubisoft&#x27;s Massive Entertainment for 12 years. He left the company earlier this year in March, as he felt that he wasn&#x27;t &quot;the right manager for what the studio has become&quot;. 
During his tenure at Massive Entertainment, Polfeldt worked on many of its leading titles and was part of the teams in charge of the delayed Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and a mysterious open-world Star Wars project.

Monthly active user data published by Activision shows player numbers have dipped over the past 12 months - from 127 million in June 2021 to just 94 million this year. 


The details are part of a tough round of financial results for Activision Blizzard this quarter, despite the recent and highly-profitable launch of Diablo Immortal.

What&#x27;s more, Western customers will need to purchase the console through Amazon Japan&#x27;s storefront due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, reports Polygon.


The console was originally intended as a Japan-only product, but &quot;by using Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;Japan Store&#x27; system, we found that at least a small number of units could be sold via Amazon.com, so a portion was allocated to make the North American version,&quot; says a Sega representative.

And it&#x27;s not just about electric cars, but virtual ones too. On Friday night the second Accelerate esports championship took centre stage at the London E-Prix. Streamed live on Twitch and YouTube, it saw drivers going head-to-head to win a share of €100,000.


The esports arm of Formula E grew during the pandemic and a need to engage racing fans online. Now that&#x27;s shifted towards expanding the audience of the sport, enticing fans to watch the real E-Prix through a love of video games and esports.

The Markup has identified 37 companies that are part of the rapidly growing connected vehicle data industry that seeks to monetize such data in an environment with few regulations governing its sale or use.
While many of these companies stress they are using aggregated or anonymized data, the unique nature of location and movement data increases the potential for violations of user privacy.</span>

Introduction
The official documentation is the go-to source for any open source project. For Kubernetes,
it&#x27;s an ever-evolving Special Interest Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in their efforts

                              <span>This week marks the very long-awaited arrival of Sea of Thieves&#x27; captaincy update, and developer Rare has shared a detailed video breakdown of its new features - including ship owning, naming, and extended customisation - as part of its new Season 7 trailer.


Those who&#x27;ve been with Sea of Thieves for the long haul might recall that captaincy features were originally planned for the game&#x27;s very first post-release update, back in 2018. A development rethink after a wobbly launch saw those plans put on the back burner, so it was a bit of a surprise when they finally resurfaced some four years later during this year&#x27;s not-E3.


And now, with this Thursday&#x27;s slightly delayed launch almost upon us, we have a much clearer idea of how the update will work, with Rare&#x27;s new video suggesting at least one of the aims of captaincy is to answer player calls for more to spend their amassed in-game wealth on.

                              <span>Netflix is readying for the September arrival of its animated Cyberpunk 2077 series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, with the release of its first full trailer, introducing some of the story&#x27;s key players.


Edgerunners, which was announced back in June 2020, is a 10-episode collaboration between Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt and Japanese animation studio Trigger, which has previously worked on the likes of Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill. It tells the story of a street kid trying to survive in the technology and body modification obsessed Night City.


&quot;Having everything to lose,&quot; explains Netflix, &quot;he stays alive by becoming an Edgerunner - a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk.&quot;

                              <span>DICE has detailed its imminent 1.2 update for the beleaguered Battlefield 2042, which will, among other things, herald its first batch of planned map improvements based on the player feedback it requested earlier this year.


This initial round of improvements will target Battlefield 2042&#x27;s Kaleidoscope map, and will - as previously detailed - focus on adjustments to cover, intensity, line of sight, pathing, and traversal. These have been achieved by adding new flag positions, by placing new areas and assets around the map, and by raising terrain.


DICE says terrain changes will &quot;break sightlines and let infantry move more purposefully around the map&quot;, while new assets will &quot;bring more tactical destruction&quot;, giving players new options as the environment evolves throughout a game.

                              <span>Riot has announced its upcoming 2D fighter Project L, which is set in the world of Runeterra, will be free to play.


&quot;One of our goals is to remove as many barriers as possible from you enjoying Project L,&quot; explained developer Tom Cannon in a new video, which can be watched below. &quot;We want you to be able to play, no matter where you live, what your skill level is, or how much money you have to spend on a game.&quot;


Meanwhile, Cannon has said the Project L team will be &quot;respectful&quot; of its players&#x27; &quot;time and wallet&quot; when it comes to monetisation.

                              <span>Apex Legends&#x27; 14th season, officially known as Hunted, is right around the corner, and Respawn is currently in full-on hype mode ahead of its 9th August arrival. And now, following the official unveiling of new hero Vantage last week, the developer now confirmed a major overhaul for its original Kings Canyon map, alongside a level cap increase for players.


Kings Canyon has, of course, been around since Apex Legends&#x27; launch back in 2019, and Season 14&#x27;s extensive overhaul aims to improve some of the ageing map&#x27;s more troublesome issues. Before we get to the mechanical stuff though, there&#x27;s perhaps the most immediately obvious change - upgraded lighting and a new skybox, both intended to make for a &quot;more immersive, vibrant environment&quot;.


In terms of gameplay changes though, there&#x27;s the new Relic point of interest, which is designed to help create a little bit more breathing space on the map in the early to mid game so squad battles are less likely to be interrupted by third parties. This has been achieved by filling the Skull Town and Thunderdome area sunk in Season 5 with sand and building a new series of winding, interconnected buildings for fresh skirmishes, complete with a giant skull centerpiece.

In the manager career portion of Career Mode, you can use the likeness of a raft of famous managers from the Premier League, including Jürgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel.

&quot;We&#x27;ve seen feedback from players wanting to play as some of their favourite managers, and we&#x27;re happy to say FIFA 23 enables you to play as one of the 350+ authentic football managers, of which 30+ have star heads, in Career Mode,&quot; EA said in a detailed blog post.

                              <span>A Brazilian governmental filing has given us a rare glimpse into Sony&#x27;s thoughts on the impending $69bn Microsoft buyout of Activision Blizzard - and specifically, the fact that Xbox will soon own blockbuster first-person shooter franchise Call of Duty. 


In Brazil, companies within the same sphere of any such corporate transaction are asked for their thoughts on deals of this magnitude. And, intriguingly for us, Brazil also posts all of these details online (albeit in some cases with redacted passages). 


Sony&#x27;s response is largely public, and contains a number of arguments which paint the potential of Xbox owning Call of Duty in a problematic light (as spotted by ResetEra, and translated for us by Eurogamer Portugal).

Bromander guested on the podcast Visionaries to discuss Among Us&#x27; rise in popularity, the impact it had on Innersloth, and what the company&#x27;s next plans are.


Among Us first released in 2018 but didn&#x27;t see mainstream popularity until 2020. During that time, Bromander stated that he, along with fellow co-founder Forrest Willard and mutual friend Amy Liu, were working full-time on Among Us.

                              <span>A Diablo Immortal player has splashed a huge amount of cash on their character in Blizzard&#x27;s divisive new game. 


However, as a result, their matchmaking record is now &quot;so high&quot; they &quot;literally can&#x27;t get a battleground&quot;.


Content creator jtisallbusiness is now debating an attempt to get a refund for their spending - which they claim to be &quot;around $100k&quot; - from Blizzard.

The blocks, which also affect the likes of Yahoo and PayPal, come after these companies failed to comply with a requirement related to Indonesia&#x27;s content moderation laws in a timely manner.
This regulation from the Indonesian government (Penyelenggara Sistem Elektronik Swasta (PSE) or Private Electronic System Providers) aims to &quot;[establish] a system of all PSEs operating in Indonesia, [maintain] Indonesia&#x27;s digital space, [protect] public access on digital platforms, and [create] a fair system between domestic and foreign PSEs, including in terms of tax collection&quot; (thanks, nikopartners).

                              <span>Early footage of Deadrop has hit the internet, giving us a look at the project backed by controversial streamer Guy Beahm, AKA Dr Disrespect. 


However, fans of Beahm have given the footage a mixed reception - especially after the project was hyped up by the streamer and compared to Call of Duty. In June, a widely-shared comment by Beahm stated that Deadrop &quot;blows out anything from the COD engine&quot;. 


What we&#x27;re seeing today is a look at Deadrop as it stands currently, for those who paid $50 for a Founders Access Pass (yes, that&#x27;s the one which includes a procedurally-generated NFT for your character avatar).

For the unaware (most of us), Accolades could be awarded to fellow players in online games to commend their gameplay - teammates and opponents alike could be welcoming, helpful and more.


But according to an addition on the PlayStation website, the feature is being removed.

Dataminers have managed to access version 1.0 of the game - a version that was compiled on 8th October 2021, before the network test was held and before recent patches could be applied.


As detailed on YouTube by Kotn3l (spotted by PC Gamer), the game&#x27;s most infamous boss, Malenia, used to have slight differences to her moveset that made her even more aggressive.

The claim of copying comes from concept artist and Call of Duty fan Sail Lin, who has highlighted images of their own dog skin design, originally uploaded to Artstation back in December 2019.


Writing on Twitter, Lin said he was &quot;very disappointed to see my work being plagiarised by a big company like Activision in this way&quot;. Eurogamer has contacted Activision for comment.

Ring recently revealed how often the answer to that question has been yes. The Amazon company responded to an inquiry from US Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.), confirming that there have been 11 cases in 2022 where Ring complied with police “emergency” requests. In each case, Ring handed over private recordings, including video and audio, without letting users know that police had access to—and potentially downloaded—their data. This raises many concerns about increased police reliance on private surveillance, a practice that has long gone unregulated...</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming pirate game Skull and Bones is &quot;not a narrative-driven game&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to game director Ryan Barnard, who revealed to True Achievements that whilst it will have &quot;narrative pieces&quot;, focus on your player&#x27;s own story and has &quot;an underlying story&quot;, the adventure will not be &quot;narrative-driven&quot;.

&quot;Skull and Bones is not a narrative-driven game,&quot; Barnard explains. “We have narrative pieces - in the game, you&#x27;ll meet important NPCs called Kingpins which have their own stories that you&#x27;ll learn as you develop rapport with them by taking on contracts with them. There is an underlying story to the game with which we build the entire world lore, but that&#x27;s not the main focus. We want players to create their own stories and be able to choose the type of pirate they want to be.

                              <span>Firaxis has released a deep dive into Doctor Strange&#x27;s abilities, playstyle, and tactics from its upcoming strategy game, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns.

Teaming up with (wonderful) content creator Christopher Odd, Firaxis&#x27;s five-minute video lets us see how the sorcerer can be best utilised when the card-based strategy game finally drops later this year.

As spotted by NME, Doctor Strange - a support hero - has some interesting tricks up his sleeve, including the ability to heal, protect, and completely conceal himself and allies in battle.

                              <span>It looks like Dead By Daylight has more Resident Evil content on the way.

Whilst not formally confirmed by either developer Behaviour Interactive nor Resident Evil rights holder, Capcom, credible DBD leaker DBDLeaks has shared some very convincing assets, including images of the icons, outfits, charms, dialogue lines, and character biographies for Albert Wesker, Rebecca Chambers, and Ada Wong.

Wesker - called &quot;The Mastermind&quot; - will be a playable Killer, and you&#x27;ll be able to jump into the shoes of Ada and Rebecca as Survivors. While their perks are apparently yet to be finalised, DBDLeaks has shared what they say are Wesker&#x27;s perks: Superior Anatomy, Awakened Awareness, and Terminus, which collectively allow Wesker to vault faster, see the auras of other Survivors whilst carrying one, and cause Survivors to be &quot;permanently Broken when the exit gates are open&quot;.

As spotted by the eagle-eyed members of the Disco Elysium subreddit, job listings for three new artistic positions at the studio are perhaps hinting what themes and motifs may be apparent in the studio&#x27;s next game.

Interestingly, fans of the RPG don&#x27;t necessarily think this marks a big departure for the team, though, especially given &quot;how much time [the creators] have put into cultivating the setting of Disco Elysium&quot;.

&quot;Stadia is not shutting down,&quot; the company tweeted when asked outright on Twitter if closure was imminent. &quot;Rest assured we&#x27;re always working on bringing more great games to the platform and Stadia Pro. Let us know if you have other questions.&quot;

Launching as part of The National Trust&#x27;s Festival of Archeology, it&#x27;s hoped the recreation will excite young people and get them more interested in historical landmarks, such as castles. 

&quot;A thousand years of history and we&#x27;ve re-imagined it all in Minecraft&#x27;s The Wild Update,&quot; Xbox explained on Twitter. &quot;With the help of [historian Alice Loxton] and [content creator GrianMC] we restored the ruins of National Trust&#x27;s Corfe Castle back to its former glory.&quot;

Whilst not formally confirmed by developer Neon Giant - all we got was a cheeky tease on Twitter celebrating the game&#x27;s first anniversary and a ten-second video - we are told to &quot;gear up for a new contract&quot;, leading some to speculate that it may be referencing new, and currently unannounced, DLC.

&quot;It&#x27;s our 1st Year Anniversary!&quot; Neon Giant tweeted. &quot;We&#x27;re humbled by the support and love we&#x27;ve had since launch. Thank you to our awesome community for sticking with us and for playing our game! We appreciate each and every one of you!

Led by Jakub Ben and Marcin Michalski, the newly-founded studio Dark Passenger will bring the new first-person multiplayer game to Steam, Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X. As yet, no name nor release window have been confirmed.

&quot;The troubled time has come in the Land of the Cherry Blossom when nameless conquerors overthrow the ruling shogun and took over his throne,&quot; the studio explains. &quot;Everyone who dared to oppose him, not only failed but also, against their will, joined his ranks.

Check it all out in the three-minute video below, although it all comes with the usual caveats that the new area is under development and the footage below &quot;is not indicative of the final product:

                              <span>Following Valve&#x27;s pledge to more than double its Steam Deck shipments back in June, the company has announced that improvements to its supply chain mean it&#x27;ll now be able to fulfil all current reservations for the handheld gaming PC &quot;by the end of the year&quot;.


Steam Deck has, of course, been in massive demand since its unveiling last July, with wait times for reservations rapidly stretching into this year. Unfortunately, supply chain issues forced Valve to delay initial shipments from the end of 2021 into this year, with further rollouts perhaps not as rapid as Valve would have liked.


We&#x27;ve had plenty of updates since then - Valve said it would be ramping up production into &quot;the hundreds of thousands&quot; in March, while June saw it announce shipments would more than double in the coming months - and the latest brings great news for those that already have Steam Deck reservations.

                              <span>Shortly after Nintendo released the first wave of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass DLC in March, data miners uncovered what appeared to be a near-complete list of platforms each new wave would be pulling tracks from - and the recent arrival of Wave 2 appears to validate that leak, giving fans a solid foundation for the giddy speculation of classic tracks still to come.


Following Wave 1&#x27;s release, data miner Fishguy6564 shared a video of Mario Kart 8&#x27;s track selection screen with the Booster Course Pass&#x27; ten remaining cups unlocked, complete with the platform origin of each included track. The then-unreleased Wave 2&#x27;s Turnip Cup, for instance, was shown to contain four tracks taken from Mario Kart Tour, SNES, N64, and DS, while Propeller Cup listed tracks from Tour, GBA, Wii, and a final, yet to be defined course.


We now know, following Wave 2&#x27;s release this week, that those leaked platforms line up perfectly with Mario Kart 8&#x27;s newly expanded track roster. The final track listing for the Turnip Cup is New York Minute (Mario Kart Tour), Mario Cart Circuit 3 (SNES), Kalimari Desert (N64), and Waluigi Pinball (DS), while the Propeller Cup brings Sydney Sprint (Tour), Snow Land (GBA), Mushroom Gorge (Wii), and Sky-High Sundae (Tour). Notably, the latter is debuting as part of the Booster Pack but coming to Tour later, which might explain its absent tag in the leak.

                              <span>Following an extensive report into the development of Rockstar&#x27;s hugely anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 earlier this week, a few additional claims have surfaced, giving a clearer indication of just how ambitious the project was originally planned to be.


Rockstar finally confirmed development on GTA 6 was &quot;well underway&quot; earlier this year, and while official details remain extremely limited, a report by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier on Tuesday shared a number of tantalising details about the project, claiming it&#x27;ll be set in Miami and will feature the series&#x27; first female protagonist as part of a Bonny and Clyde-style duo.


Notably, though, Schreier claimed Rockstar&#x27;s initial plans were much more ambitious, featuring a map that would include &quot;large swaths of North and South America&quot;. Axios&#x27; Stephen Totilo has since added a little more detail to those claims, citing his own source as saying Rockstar had earlier planned to have four protagonists in GTA 6, with the action unfolding across three cities.

                              <span>Meta has released its quarterly financial results, giving insight into its recent decision to increase the price of its Meta Quest 2 headset.


Reality Labs, the division of Meta which works on its virtual reality and metaverse products, posted a net $2.8bn loss over the last three months. 


Revenue during this period saw a 48 percent increase to $452m, which CFO Dave Wehner attributed to sales of Meta Quest 2 during Meta&#x27;s earnings call with investors, but this was heavily outweighed by the costs and investments Meta is putting into Reality Labs.

For example, someone has taken inspiration from the truly horrifying PT demo, and remade it using the tools from Forge mode.


Spotted by PC Gamer, cosplayer Death Templar shared their PT x Halo hybrid creation on YouTube. As with PT, the player starts in a barren and gloomy room, with only one exit. The difference here, however, is that they have a gun (and I didn&#x27;t spot a cockroach on the floor).

This competition has helped the industry, Moore continued, and saw Microsoft continuing to commit to video games despite the Xbox 360&#x27;s costly &quot;Red Ring of Death&quot; debacle.


&quot;We encouraged the console wars, not to create division, but to challenge each other,&quot; Moore said, speaking on the Front Office Sports podcast (thanks, IGN). &quot;And when I say each other I mean Microsoft and Sony.

                              <span>Last night, an upgrade for What Remains of Edith Finch was officially confirmed during Annapurna&#x27;s recent showcase. This was following rumours the game would be getting Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions earlier this month. 


However, if you are one of the many who got their hands on the game when it was included as part of PlayStation Plus, there&#x27;s bad news. The new upgrade is only available to those who actually purchased the game, rather than getting it via Sony&#x27;s subscription service.

                              <span>Sony is still to see its promised accelaration in PlayStation 5 production, the company&#x27;s latest financial results show. 


During the three months ending 30th June, Sony shipped 2.4m consoles, only a slight increase on the 2.3m it managed during the same time last year. 


This contrasts with Sony&#x27;s forecast for the year, during which it expects to sell 18m consoles compared to the 11.5m it sold in 2021.

The update will add in: subtitle size, colour and background toggles; speaker name display in story mode; closed captions; and a permanent reticle.


It&#x27;s a small but notable list of options that will hopefully open the modern horror classic to a wider audience.

YouTuber BjornTheBear decided to pit the top 21 animal field bosses against one another in a battle to the death on Caelid&#x27;s battlefield, to determine which was the strongest.


This was done over a series of rounds, firstly with each creature at their usual strength and then scaled to match.

A new report from The Wrap has revealed that following its buyout by Amazon, MGM has lost the rights to the Tomb Raider films. The studio reportedly had until May of this year to move ahead with a sequel, but that ship has now sailed.


As a result, a &quot;host of Hollywood movie studios&quot; are currently making bids on the rights to the film, with insiders revealing that this has resulted in Alicia Vikander being removed from the project.

Earlier today, reddit user sadfutago - behind all the videos so far - posted a link to a Twitch stream that revealed all behind the previously unseen secret church area and its use of Nier: Replicant assets.



The stream showed various assets from the game and the secret church area, before admitting all was done through an in-game mod, which will be made available publicly. The VOD wasn&#x27;t saved but you can still watch clips of the broadcast.

                              <span>Frogwares, the developer behind last year&#x27;s investigatory open-world adventure Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, has announced it&#x27;s remaking Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, a Lovecraft-themed crossover the studio originally released back in 2007.


The Awakened was Frogwares&#x27; third Sherlock Holmes adventure, and the developer&#x27;s ongoing association with the detective has resulted in an additional six instalments in the series since then, meaning it&#x27;s got years of experience to build on as it reimagines its 2007 title for modern audiences - not to mention its further dalliances with Lovecraft in 2019&#x27;s The Sinking City.


Frogwares&#x27; &quot;full remake and substantial rewrite&quot; of The Awakened will shift the events of the original to serve as a continuation of its young Sherlock arc, started in last year&#x27;s Chapter One. As such, it&#x27;ll follow a young Sherlock Holmes, along with his new acquaintance John Watson, on his first big case in London - an adventure that&#x27;ll span Victorian London, a Swiss psychiactric ward, the New Orleans bayous, and the Scottish Highlands as the fledging detective wrestles with dark, Lovecraft-inspired horrors.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - the promising co-op shooter/melee hybrid from Vermintide developer Fatshark - has been delayed again. It&#x27;s now due for a PC release on 30th November, with the Xbox Series X/S version arriving &quot;shortly after&quot;.


This will, of course, be the second delay for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, which was announced at the tail-end of 2020 for release the following year. Unfortunately, its development - as with many recent games - was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and Fatshark ultimately made the decision to push its launch into 2022 in order to &quot;focus on the level of quality on release, as well as invest in more systems to support Darktide for years to come.&quot;


March finally brought the news fans had been waiting for, with Darktide receiving a 13th September release date on PC and Xbox Series X/S, but that&#x27;s now shifted again.

                              <span>Sony has unveiled the new Backbone One PlayStation Edition, an officially licensed iPhone controller created with PS Remote Play in mind.


Backbone One PlayStation Edition is identical to the existing Backbone One controller, with one key difference: it eschews the original&#x27;s black colour scheme in favour of pristine white hues inspired by Sony&#x27;s DualSense wireless controller. However, other familiar DualSense design elements, including parallel thumbsticks, are not replicated.


Sony is promoting the Backbone One PlayStation Edition - which is powered by the connected device - as the perfect companion to its PS Remote Play service, enabling players to stream their games from their PS4 or PS5 consoles to their iPhones using the dedicated App Store app.

                              <span>Goat Simulator 3 - which, in a fine example of a joke gone wildly out of control, is actually the direct sequel to the original Goat Simulator - has been given a release date and will be launching for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 17th November.


The original Goat Simulator, developed by Coffee Stain Studios, launched back in 2014, delivering a daft blast of physics-based nonsense in which players took control of a goat, causing chaos, inflicting damage, and accruing points across an open-world map. 


Its goat-themed mayhem struck a chord and the game went on to sell &quot;millions&quot; of copies, in turn convincing Coffee Stain that a sequel was required. Goat Simulator 3 (because sequential numbering be damned) was announced earlier this year, promising, among other things, a new sandbox world known as San Angora, full of quests, collectibles, and secrets.

Speaking as part of an official interview published by Nintendo, Xenoblade developer Genki Yokota was asked whether we would ever see more from Xenoblade Chronicles, given that he had previously called 3 &quot;the culmination of the series&quot;. 


In response, Yokota replied: &quot;Yes it will still go on.&quot; In fact, he said he wanted to keep it going for &quot;as long as possible&quot;.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing Rockstar, and how its internal improvements may also change its games and the wider games industry.

Yesterday&#x27;s eye-catching report into Rockstar discussed positive changes for employees and suggested this new company outlook could also be reflected in Grand Theft Auto 6, whenever it finally arrives. How important are these changes, and could the industry as a whole benefit? Or should we be calling some of these things out as long overdue, and simply just a bare minimum? 

Also this week, the Nier: Automata secret church/door - the apparent existence of which has been puzzling fans and the wider internet. Is it a brand new discovery? A very clever mod? Or an incredibly elaborate marketing ploy for a new Nier game by the tight-lipped Yoko Taro? Join Ed Nightingale, Ishraq Subhan, Liv Ngan and myself as we try to explain.

                              <span>Minecraft Java Edition&#x27;s new update is here, and developer Mojang has responded to players who still aren&#x27;t happy with its Player Reporting system. 

The new changes were first introduced a month ago in a pre-release of version 1.19.1  and players were already voicing their concerns online.
JewelTK, who runs their own Minecraft server, posted a video on Minecraft&#x27;s subreddit explaining why they were against the change.

The announcement was made by game director Adam Brennecke, along with news of a final early access update out today which includes a huge revision to the game&#x27;s armour and upgrade systems.

This group has been campaigning for improved working conditions since the company was hit with allegations of a toxic work environment, including numerous accounts of sexual harassment and assault concerning multiple employees at the company.


However, the group says, its demands for change have not been met despite Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot vowing he would do &quot;everything in [his] power to ensure that everyone... feels welcomed, respected, and safe&quot;.

                              <span>Life is Strange is getting its first tie-in prose novel, titled Steph&#x27;s Story. 


The book, which is set to launch on 21st March 2023, will chart the life of fan-favourite D&amp;D lover Steph while on the road with her bandmate Izzie. 


This sounds like the time period which directly precedes last year&#x27;s True Colors and its Steph-focused DLC chapter Wavelengths, which I enjoyed. That DLC included a few voice clips from Izzie in the form of memories, and hinted at a sad end to Steph&#x27;s time roadtripping while in a musical duo.

For the former, an announcement on Twitter stated the game would be pulled from 31st July, although existing owners will not be impacted.


&quot;The initial digital game was released 9 years ago, and we no longer feel the current quality and reliability are on par with what Pandemic deserves on digital platforms,&quot; reads the statement.

                              <span>Zombies have returned to Call of Duty Warzone in a limited-time mode called Rebirth of the Dead.


While we last saw zombies in the now blown-up Verdansk map, this time they will be invading Rebirth Island, which was first introduced with the release of Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War. 


The new mode, developed by support studio Beenox, has had some significant changes from the previous mode to better fit into Rebirth Island&#x27;s smaller map design.

                              <span>Many have hoped Rockstar will one day release a Bully remake or sequel, but currently these hopes seem unlikely to bear fruit.
Now, however, a fan has taken matters into their own hands, and remade a trailer for the game in Unreal Engine 5, bringing it into the modern age.

YouTube channel TeaserPlays, a &quot;Graphics Designer studio&quot;, has released its vision of Bully today (thanks, Dexerto).

The patch notes from Valve state: &quot;Added support for Nintendo Online classic controllers&quot;. That means you can use your NES, SNES, Mega Drive, or N64 wireless controllers with PC games.


If you&#x27;re looking to grab a controller, though, they&#x27;re available exclusively on Nintendo&#x27;s store for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.

The last time a pop-up was held in the UK was from 19th October to 15th November back in 2019 at Westfield Shepherd&#x27;s Bush location.


This year, the pop-up will be held alongside the Pokémon World Championships at ExCeL London from 17th to 21st August. The Pokémon World Championships is an invite-only esports event run by The Pokémon Company, but the store will be open for anyone to attend.

                              <span>The death of a sim can be an emotional time. The Grim Reaper shows up with his scythe in hand, the family gathers around to send their loved one off, and a period of mourning descends upon the house. But, if a Sim has lived a good, long life, this can also be a chance for celebration in recognition of time well spent. 


However, a new glitch was accidentally introduced in a recent update for The Sims 4, and it is fast tracking this whole process. This means that some elderly sims have been dropping dead well before their time. As well as this, children are rapidly becoming teens, teens becoming young adults and so on.


Players are reporting this all happening after a visit to create-a-sim (CAS), or during the loading screens. This is even when the game&#x27;s &quot;Long Lifespan&quot; is enabled.

That&#x27;s according to reliable app store analytics firm Sensor Tower, which compared Diablo Immortal&#x27;s start to that of Pokémon Go (which took just two weeks to rake in $100m) and Fire Emblem Heroes (10 weeks). 


Diablo Immortal revenues now seem set to accelerate, since the app arrived belatedly in China this week.

As we&#x27;ve reported, reddit user sadfutago has been posting videos of a secret church area in Nier: Automata that has been previously unseen since it was released five years ago. Even Yoko Taro chimed in.


Now they&#x27;ve posted new, extended videos to reddit with more gameplay of the church area. They show a different character - 9S - battling a &quot;black blocky guy&quot; the poster is struggling to beat, as well as new written dialogue in Japanese.

This has been a long requested feature by PS5 owners, and a feature that the Xbox Series X/S has supported since launch. 


The feature is currently only available for users signed up to the beta firmware channel, but it should be released to all users very soon.

                              <span>Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s July patch has squeaked in just before the month is up, bringing three new cars to the ever-expanding roster in the free update - and this update brings a little bit more besides. 
The cars are a fine selection, led by another Skyline but a pretty special one at that - the Group 5 Skyline Super Silhouette, a brilliantly boxy racing beast that terrorised race tracks in the 80s. If you prefer your cars with a few more curves then there&#x27;s a Maserati A6GCS/53 Spyder, an early example from the Italian manufacturer that established many of the styling cues that remain to this day. Finally there&#x27;s a Porsche 918 Spyder, a hypercar that&#x27;s been notable in its absence from recent Gran Turismo games. 
That&#x27;s all well and good, but the real star of the update is excused by the Tomica sponsorship carried on that Skyline Super Silhouette with an update to the Scapes photo mode allowing you to take your cars to toy towns and pose for snaps. It&#x27;s not quite Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels, but it&#x27;s a fun new feature nevertheless.

                              <span>Point-and-click specialist Wadjet Eye Games - the studio behind the acclaimed likes of Unavowed and the celebrated Blackwell series - is teaming up with  indie studio Cloak and Dagger Games to publish its forthcoming folk horror adventure The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow on PC, Mac, and Linux later this year.


While the name might not be familiar, Cloak and Dagger Games has been steadily making a name for itself in the point-and-click genre over the last half-decade with a series of idiosyncratic short-form adventures, primarily within the realm of horror. A few of them, including deliciously creepy early title A Date in the Park, with its expert ratcheting of unease, can be played for free. 


The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow is Cloak and Dagger&#x27;s first new title since 2019&#x27;s Lovecraft-inspired freebie The Terrible Old Man, and follows the Victorian-era adventure of antiquarian and author Thomasina Bateman as she arrives in the remote village of Bewlay after receiving a mysterious summons concerning its ancient barrows.

The mod ban accompanies the integration of Easy Anti-Cheat in an attempt to combat &quot;malicious modded clients&quot;.


The latest debacle began earlier this week, when VRChat announced the ban and the inclusion of Easy Anti-Cheat, as well as an open beta beginning immediately to test the update. On Discord, VRChat staff member Tupper revealed they expected the update to be rolled out to all players within 24 hours.

(I&#x27;m leaving out the Nintendo Switch version here because, as we know, it&#x27;s yet another &quot;Legacy Edition&quot;.)

                              <span>The Nintendo Switch Online app has a new update, which lets you send friend requests from your phone.
Adding friends on Nintendo Switch has always been slightly cumbersome, but Nintendo has made a step towards making the process a bit more streamlined on its app.
You can now send friend requests from within the app by typing in a friend code, nicely complementing the update from March we reported on that allowed users to easily copy their friend code. Alternatively, you can get your friend code as a URL or QR code, which can then be used by someone else to send you a friend request.

The report centres on changes within Rockstar since the company&#x27;s public reckoning with crunch in 2018, when founder Dan Houser said his team had worked &quot;100-hour weeks&quot; to finish Red Dead Redemption 2, and after various reports of the company&#x27;s frat-house-style operation. 


Subsequent changes to working styles and benefits are part of an attempt to &quot;reinvent&quot; the company as a more progressive workplace, the report states, which also extends to the content featured in its games.

                              <span>The peer-to-peer servers for Evolve: Stage 2 have been resurrected. 


As noticed by NME, Evolve: Stage 2 players are now able to matchmake and join peer-to-peer multiplayer games online once more.


This change has come thanks to a fan-made Discord channel for the game, which reached out to publisher 2K in a bid to find out more about its decision to close the servers down (something that happened all the way back in 2018).

                              <span>A bug is plaguing Diablo Immortal which has seen players losing out on XP rewards for gaining levels. This is even though Blizzard has supposedly released a fix.


As noted by PCGamerN, players reported earlier this month that they were not receiving XP rewards as expected for progressing through the game&#x27;s battle pass. 


&quot;I completed bounties and finished a battle pass rank,&quot; wrote one user on reddit. &quot;The XP animation played but the XP bar did not increase at all.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft is testing a new set of logos that will appear as &quot;badges&quot; over titles in your game library. 


These badges are already used to denote titles available via Xbox Game Pass, or that have Xbox Series X/S-specific features. 


New badges are being tested for other game conditions, so you can see at a glance what you have available to play. For example, a new logo will appear over games that are disc installs where that disc isn&#x27;t currently inserted - perhaps it&#x27;s around a friend&#x27;s? Or down the back of the sofa?

The developer revealed its removal yesterday, stating that this is all is due to a &quot;licensing issue&quot;. 


Instead, the company has now added a &quot;replacement default sound&quot;.

                              <span>Stephane D&#x27;Astous, founder and former boss of Deus Ex developer Eidos Montreal, has described Square Enix&#x27;s handling of its Western studios as a &quot;train wreck in slow motion&quot; in an explosive new interview. 


Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, D&#x27;Astous criticised Square Enix&#x27;s past management of its various Western studios and suggested the recent sale of Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics could have been motivated by a desire to court a buyout by PlayStation.


&quot;It was a trajectory that could be predicted,&quot; D&#x27;Astous said, discussing the decline of Square Enix&#x27;s Western studios, and Eidos Montreal in particular. &quot;I left because things were missing at head office. [Pre-Square Enix] Eidos has a great tradition of development teams, but they don&#x27;t have superior knowledge of how to sell their games. And that was quite clear.&quot;

                              <span>The mystery of the church and secret door in Nier: Automata continues.

Yesterday we reported how reddit user sadfutago posted a video entering a previously unfound door that led to an unseen church area, leaving dataminers scratching their heads. Is this truly a new secret in the game, or an elaborate modded hoax?



Even the team behind the game has shared the videos on Twitter, including the game&#x27;s creator Yoko Taro.

                              <span>Meta, formerly Facebook, has announced a major set of pricing changes to its Meta Quest 2 VR headsets, starting in August. 


Both the 128GB and 256GB versions of the headset will rise in price by $100, Meta said in a statement last night, from $300 to $400, and from $400 to $500, respectively.


These are serious price increases - for the 128GB model, it represents a rise of 33 percent! - for hardware generally considered a good entry-level VR device.

                              <span>Elden Ring players are disappointed with the game&#x27;s PvP multiplayer and its lack of balance.

                              <span>Warner Bros brawler MultiVersus has seen a strong start on Steam, following the arrival of its open beta yesterday.


At the time of writing, its player count is sitting at a comfortable 49,486, with a peak of 144,456 today.


These numbers currently put it ahead of other popular (although admittedly older) games such as Monster Hunter Rise, Destiny 2 and Fifa 22.

Bloomberg said developer Aspyr fired the game&#x27;s art director and design director this month, and told staff the hotly-anticipated remake is &quot;on pause&quot;.


The dramatic decision comes after Aspyr, which has been working on the game for three years, demoed a vertical slice to Lucasfilm and publisher Sony at the end of June. Apparently Aspyr bosses told staff this demo &quot;wasn&#x27;t where they wanted it to be&quot;.

                              <span>Good essay arguing that open-source software is a critical national-security asset and needs to be treated as such:
Open source is at least as important to the economy, public services, and national security as proprietary code, but it lacks the same standards and safeguards. It bears the qualities of a public good and is as indispensable as national highways. Given open source’s value as a public asset, an institutional structure must be built that sustains and secures it.
This is not a novel idea. Open-source code has been called the “roads and bridges”...</span>

Today&#x27;s announcement comes just days after former WWE boss Vince McMahon announced his retirement from the company, amidst multiple claims of sexual misconduct.

IO has also revealed the opening cinematic for the Ambrose Island mission, which has some familiar faces as well as new targets within. You can see it for yourself below.

                              <span>Four WWE 2K games have been quietly removed from sale on Steam, video game sports fans have noticed. 


WWE 2K17, 2K18, 2K19 and 2K20 are all now missing from the Steam store on PC, and from both the PlayStation and Microsoft stores on consoles.


The move - which Steam-tracker suggests took place just over a week ago - leaves only the franchise&#x27;s more recent WWE 2K Battlegrounds and WWE 2K22 on sale (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Last week, Minecraft maker Mojang announced a firm ban on the use of NFTs within its hit sandbox game, to a warm response from many players.


The ban was seen by many fans as reactive - as some user-made projects have already used Minecraft to shift NFTs in the past. 


Now, one of the largest of those - NFT Worlds - has issued a response via Twitter, and said it would create &quot;a new game and platform&quot; instead (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Today we got a little bit more information about PlayStation VR2, Sony&#x27;s next foray into the world of virtual reality.
A new blog from PlayStation has detailed the user experience features available upon its release. 
These include a very useful looking see-through view and a customisable play area set up, among others.

Modder KangieDanie has uploaded a splitscreen multipawer - sorry, multiplayer - mod for PC that lets you play through the campaign in local co-op.  


KangieDanie notes that the mod is in very early development so if you decide to give it a try, you&#x27;re inevitably going to run into some bugs.

To accompany this official announcement, however, we also have a new trailer from Blizzard. Here, the gates to the frozen plains of Northrend are opened once again as battle ensues all around.
You can check it out for yourself below.

For members who pay monthly, you&#x27;ll pay a pound extra (£8.99 instead of £7.99, for a total of £107.88 a year). 


The rise follows a similar price hike by streaming rival Netflix back in March - its second in just 18 months. Both companies offer games as part of their subscriptions.

The news was shared on the Valorant site, stating that Dawn &quot;Dawn&quot; Park and Vivian &quot;Risorah&quot; Dela Cruz used vulgar language and harassed a member of the Galorants community.



Dawn has been suspended from competitions for three months; Risorah has been suspended for nine months.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a big new addition to Pokémon Go today, named Daily Adventure Incense. 


This free item will refresh each day and offer you 15 minutes of Pokémon spawns - as long as you keep walking. Included in the list of possible creatures are a long list of uncommon critters, evolved species and... the surprise debut of Galar&#x27;s Legendary bird trio from Pokémon Sword and Shield!


It&#x27;s worth noting these three have only a chance to appear, and even then have a low catch and high flee rate. Still, there are already plenty of reports of players successfully acquiring at least one of them, just 12 hours in.

                              <span>Creator Ron Gilbert has released a new snippet of gameplay from his upcoming release, Return to Monkey Island. 


Here, we get our first look at the dialogue options mechanic in-game (you can also see it on the Return to Monkey Island website when you chat to Stan), and meet the formidable Judge Plank. 


The clip starts by showing hero Guybrush Threepwood making his way along a snow-ridden and far from tropical street. Those icicles look like they could do some serious damage, and I am getting goose pimples just writing about them.

Modder NorskPL is taking commissions for Stray on a name-your-own-price basis, dependent on complexity.
Already, it seems people have been calling upon NorskPL&#x27;s services, as their most recent uploads include many requested cat customeowsations.

                              <span>It looks like Dark Souls 3 PC online servers may be coming back soon.


It&#x27;s been over 183 days since the servers were shut down following the discovery of a security issue in the multiplayer functionality affecting all three Dark Souls games on PC.


However, an update to the game on the SteamDB page suggests a solution could be on the way soon.

The discovery was made by reddit user sadfutago and has dataminers scratching their heads at how it was achieved.


Some spoilers for Nier: Automata follow.

                              <span>Earlier this month, Rockstar confirmed the end of any major support for Red Dead Online, with the developer shifting its focus to Grand Theft Auto 6. This left many cowboys disappointed (to put it mildly), to the extent an in-game funeral was held to mourn this loss.


While Rockstar may be jumping ship and swimming away from its Red Dead franchise, modders are not. In fact, a mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 will let you play as a totally new character of your own creation, give you a new skill tree to fill up and allow you to take on all-new heists. 
I appreciate I said &#x27;new&#x27; quite a lot there, but it fits the bill. This is no small undertaking by the modding community.

Born in Manchester in 1941, Warner developed a prolific acting career that stretched across seven decades and  spanned film, television, stage and video games.


On the big screen, Warner starred in movies such as Titanic, The Omen and Mary Poppins Returns. In 1981, he won an Emmy for his role in historical epic Masada.

Nintendo has not given any further details of the maintenance it has planned, or why it is happening now.

Lockdown Mode offers an extreme, optional level of security for the very few users who, because of who they are or what they do, may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Turning on Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware...</span>

                              <span>If you found yourself suitably enthused for American Truck Simulator&#x27;s Montana expansion following last week&#x27;s 30 minutes of soothing cross-country trundling, there&#x27;s some great news; it turns out developer SCS Software was somewhat underselling it when it said development was &quot;slowly approaching the finish line&quot; - the Montana expansion is out next week.


Montana - which will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s tenth explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming - launches next Thursday, 4th August, giving players the chance to admire its &quot;glistening glacial lakes, snow-capped mountain peaks, blue-ribbon trout streams, and mighty Missouri, Yellowstone, and Flathead Rivers&quot;, all from behind the wheel.


Those curious for a glimpse at the routes American Truck Simulator&#x27;s Montana expansion will unlock can get a taste of the journeys ahead in SCS&#x27; newly updated map. Montana&#x27;s beautifully recreated landmarks also get an airing in the launch trailer below, but for a more genteel preview, SCS&#x27; wonderfully relaxing 30-minute sight-seeing tour is well worth your time.

                              <span>Ubisoft has responded to a recent report claiming Roller Champions will be winding down after its third season, insisting it &quot;isn&#x27;t getting cancelled&quot; and that it &quot;fully supports&quot; the project.


Word that Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play sports game was nearing the end of its life, despite only launching back in May, came via the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb during a segment on the Xbox Era podcast over the weekend.


In reponse, Ubisoft has now shared a statement on Twitter denying those claims and insisting &quot;Roller Champions isn&#x27;t getting cancelled. But while an imminent demise doesn&#x27;t currently appear to be on the cards, Ubisoft does say it will be extending Roller Champions&#x27; current season, Disco Fever, in order to &quot;focus on what our players have told us needs improvement&quot;.

                              <span>Daedalic Entertainment has delayed the launch of Lord of the Rings: Gollum once more, this time pushing its previously announced 1st September release back &quot;by a few months&quot;.


Lords of the Rings: Gollum was announced in March 2019, promising a Middle-Earth-inspired blend of &quot;subtle tactical stealth&quot;, environmental puzzling, climbing challenges, and &quot;fast-paced parkour action&quot;, all playing out across a mixture of open levels and more linear missions.


Daedelic was originally aiming to launch Gollum last year, but ultimately made the decision to delay its release into 2022, although no reason was given at the time. This latest delay, though, has been made in order to &quot;deliver the best possible experience&quot;, according to the developer.

                              <span>EA is reportedly the latest studio to get a slice of the Marvel action, with new claims suggesting it&#x27;s currently working on a new single-player, open-world game based on the Black Panther series.
That&#x27;s according to loose-lipped journalist Jeff Grubb who, speaking as part of Giant Bomb&#x27;s Game Mess Mornings stream, claimed the project will be single-player-only title, with EA&#x27;s aim being to build on the success of developer Respawn&#x27;s well-received solo adventure Jedi: Fallen Order.
While details are inevitably limited at this juncture - the title is said to be in &quot;very early development&quot; - Grubb claimed the basic premise is that players will need to complete various challenges in a bid to become the new Black Panther, following the death of an earlier incarnation at the start of the game.

                              <span>Roblox planned numerous concessions to Chinese state censorship and expected its game be hacked and cloned by Chinese companies as part of its launch in the country, an astonishing cache of leaked internal documents has revealed. 


The details, published by Vice, come from documents recently obtained by a hacker and held to ransom, before being posted online. Vice has said it has published these details to shine a light on the lengths that Western companies can be forced to go to if they decide to enter the Chinese market.


Revelations revealed in the report include instructions to Roblox employees in one internal presentation to &quot;expect that hacking has already started&quot; and that it would &quot;ramp up after a deal is signed, possibly even by [Roblox&#x27;s] partner&quot;.

                              <span>Stray may have only recently been released, but someone has already deciphered the game&#x27;s mysterious language. 
This language uses a substitution cipher to make the world in Stray more cryptic and mysterious. (A substitution cipher is a used to encrypt text by swapping each letter or symbol within said text with a different symbol, that can then be unscrambled with a key.)
And now, HalfGlassGaming&#x27;s Josh Wirtanen has cracked Stray&#x27;s cipher, and shared how we too can do the same (thanks, RockPaperShotgun). I have embedded some photos from the game within this article, so if you are yet to play or are keen to avoid spoilers, please take this as your cue to read something else on Eurogamer.

It follows the recent TwitchCon Amsterdam event that saw nearly 14,500 people attend, an increase of 65 percent compared to the previous Berlin-held event in 2019.


That popularity is in part testament to the rise of the streaming platform during the pandemic, which now encompasses audiences far outside gaming.

Players who logged into the Apex Legends client on 23rd July may have spotted the preview image uploaded by Respawn. It&#x27;s since been removed from the client, but not before it could be immortalised on the internet.

While this on its own is not all that newsworthy, what makes these upcoming releases by Hasbro more interesting is that they give us all a look at Cal Kestis&#x27; new, and therefore older, image. This includes some impressively-manicured facial furniture. 
Cal&#x27;s beard is groomed impeccably on the soon-to-be-released model, making me wonder how he got such a close shave. Perhaps he took cutthroat shaving to the extreme and used his lightsaber for the job? Who can say, but he has certainly grown up since the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

But Druckmann has now poured cold water on the claims, calling them &quot;false rumours&quot;.

I, myself, have a Lara Croft one as part of my ever-growing Tomb Raider collection of &#x27;stuff&#x27;. 
Well, soon we will be seeing these diminutive, top-heavy, figurines in a whole new light, as a new partnership between Funko and Jon Burton&#x27;s 10.10 Games studio was announced at San Diego Comic-Con. This collaboration promises us &quot;AAA video games&quot; that will eventually head our way. 
You can watch the trailer - which features a guitar-loving and crown-wearing Funko called Freddy - for it all below.

A 3.5GB update was made available for the game earlier today, Eurogamer spotted. Now, developer Futurlab has confirmed this patch is designed to alleviate the game&#x27;s Xbox crash issues. 


Last week, Futurlab offered an unusual tip to avoid multiplayer crashes - to stop looking at the sun. Apparently, issues with the game&#x27;s lens flare visuals were at fault. (It&#x27;s also just good advice in general.)

If anything, Nintendo actually wanted her Link outfit in previous games to be more revealing.

                              <span>A new update for Xbox Series X/S speeds up the consoles&#x27; cold boot time by cutting the length of the startup logo animation.


Five seconds are saved with the launch of a new, faster Xbox logo, which whooshes on and off your screen in around four seconds rather than nine.


Xbox Insiders with access to Microsoft&#x27;s most up-to-date Xbox Series X/S system update are able to see the faster boot logo in action now, The Verge noticed. The change will roll out to all users over time.

Well, that is, until you get the modding community involved. 
Yes, a new mod developed by Kirbymimi finally brings a split screen multiplayer experience to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The mod adds double the Links, double the fire power and, perhaps, double the fun.

                              <span>Stray has been out for almost a week, and inevitably the internet is modding the game&#x27;s playable cat-racter. Here&#x27;s some PC mods we&#x27;ve spotted that will give you paws for thought.


If you&#x27;re a dog person, you can play as a cute French bulldog puppy thanks to modder crubino. The Happy Puppy mod even changes most of the meows into woofs, and crubino hopes to add more to it, including customisation of the puppy&#x27;s fur. As a cat person, I think that&#x27;s barking mad...


Modder hibrietas provides a modern staple for mods, the Jason mod. Taken from the infamous mall scene in Heavy Rain, meowing is replaced with &quot;a pleading call to find your lost son, you terrible father&quot;.

These changes will come separately and (it sounds like) ahead of the game&#x27;s next big feature update, which is set to add Hide &#x27;n&#x27; Seek gameplay later in 2022. 


Before that, handy features such as the ability to change the map in the lobby settings without having to leave and restart a new game will be added.

&quot;Online matchmaking will not be available with final co-op,&quot; said an Xbox representative. &quot;We encourage you to continue to use the Halo LFG and the new Discord voice call feature on Xbox to find players to party up with as you continue playing the beta.&quot;

Codenamed Rift (though likely not its final title), this is the Baghdad-focused project which originally began life as a Valhalla expansion. It has since grown its own fully-fledged project, albeit tighter in scope than other recent, sprawling Assassin&#x27;s Creed entries.


Originally reported to arrive later this year (though still to be officially announced by Ubisoft itself), Bloomberg has now stated that Rift will arrive in either May or June 2023.

                              <span>Despite Halo Infinite being unsupported on Steam Deck due to &quot;anti-cheat&quot;, by using a new driver one owner has managed to get Master Chief&#x27;s latest outing up and running on the portable PC.
Sharing some gameplay on reddit, DanTheBloke (via exputer) explained that the latest update to Proton GE has allowed them to get online play for Halo Infinite working on their Steam Deck through the beta SteamOS.
DanTheBloke does say gameplay &quot;can be a little janky&quot; and there is &quot;some clipping audio at times&quot;. Regardless though, it is definitely still playable, as you can see for yourself below.

Creator Lucas Pope, who went on to create the equally brilliant Return of the Obra Dinn, announced the mobile version of Papers, Please over the weekend with a 5th August release date.

In Papers, Please you play as a border control agent for a fictional Eastern Bloc country, and must balance formal immigration checks with the emotional guilt-trip of turning away the starving and needy.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a fair while since developer SCS Software revealed American Truck Simulator&#x27;s next destination would be Montana, but now, following regular progress reports on its blog, the studio has given us our best look yet at the forthcoming expansion, sharing a scenic 30-minute drive across the state in a lengthy new gameplay video.


Montana, which was confirmed to be in development last November, will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s tenth explorable state, joining California and Nevada (both of which were included at launch in 2016), alongside DLC additions Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming.


Setting the scene for its new expansion on Steam, SCS explains, &quot;Montana is a gateway to Glacier and Yellowstone - two crown jewels of the national park system - and is home to glistening glacial lakes, snow-capped mountain peaks, blue-ribbon trout streams, and mighty Missouri, Yellowstone, and Flathead Rivers.&quot;

The upcoming prequel comic, titled as Gotham Knights - Gilded City, focuses on Batman as he attempts to quell the spread of a rage-inducing virus infecting Gotham City (thanks, PopVerse).  


This case is being billed as Batman&#x27;s final mission before his apparently very much permanent demise, so there&#x27;s likely some interesting backstory here relevant to the game.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known for a while that knockabout battle royale game Fall Guys would be bringing back its ludicrous Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles outfits this August, but a new leak has indicated there may be considerably more to next month&#x27;s Sonic collaboration, with leakers having uncovered a new stage inspired the hedgehog&#x27;s classic Green Hill Zone.


A bean-ised Sonic the Hedgehog costume initially appeared in Fall Guys all the way back in October 2020, and Knuckles made his in-store debut in November the following year. Fall Guys then continued on its merry Sonic-free way, but last month&#x27;s Sonic Central livestream brought news that both character cosmetics would be returning to the game this August - as a sort of duel hoorah for Fall Guys&#x27; recent free-to-play launch and Sonic&#x27;s 30th birthday - bringing with them a newcomer in the form of Tails.


That seemed to be as far developer Mediatonic and Sega planned to take their latest collaboration, but players started to suspect their might be more to come around a week ago, when a screenshot looking an awful lot like a new Green Hill Zone stage was spotted as appearing (presumably unintentionally) as part of Fall Guys&#x27; &#x27;up next&#x27; stage select screen.

                              <span>Following reports earlier this year that Ubisoft was in the early stages of developing a sequel to its enjoyable Greek-mythology-themed open-world adventure Immortals Fenyx Rising, new claims have surfaced suggesting this may in fact be a spin-off, rather than a full-blown sequel, and one given a new Hawaiian Polynesian theme.


The original Immortals Fenyx Rising, which released in 2020, followed the adventures of the titular Fenyx after being washed ashore on the colourful Golden Isle, home to a pantheon of Greek mythology inspired gods. What followed was a generally enjoyable blend of open-world exploration, platforming, combat, and puzzling - all narrated by the perpetually bickering twosome of Prometheus and Zeus - whose biggest flaw (aside from its rather exhaustingly stuff-saturated map) was its over-familiarity.


&quot;Blame Covid, blame budgets, blame Ubisoft, blame the paradoxically thrifty, endlessly repurposing way the publisher makes all its huge, expansive, generous games,&quot; Christian Donlan wrote in his review, &quot;but Immortals never really finds its own voice until the very end.&quot;

                              <span>For many, TwitchCon Amsterdam was a chance for the streaming community to meet each other, chat with brands, and watch some esports tournaments - notably Twitch Rivals.


But it was the event&#x27;s drag showcase that was really the talk of the convention. Capping off the first day, the TwitchCon Drag Showcase was the first event of its kind and saw over 60,000 people watching in the centre&#x27;s Glitch Theatre and streaming online - many of whom had never seen a drag show before.


Not only was the drag showcase the epicentre of LGBT+ representation at the convention, it was an opportunity to highlight the diversity of talent on Twitch. There&#x27;s far more to the platform than just playing video games, even if that&#x27;s done in makeup and a wig.

                              <span>A social media post believed to mock Chinese president Xi Jinping was behind the last-minute delay to Diablo Immortal in China, a report has suggested.


This contrasts with the official reasoning given by Chinese developer and publisher NetEase in June, which said it was holding back the game&#x27;s launch for &quot;content enhancement&quot;.


NetEase declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.

&quot;We&#x27;ve really tried to push the frontier of accessibility on this game,&quot; stated game director Matthew Gallant, showcasing Part 1&#x27;s new audio description setting - a first for a game on PlayStation. &quot;Every single accessibility option we offer, that&#x27;s a barrier removed for someone.&quot;

Speaking on Twitter, Sweeney re-iterated Epic&#x27;s previous stance that the company would not block games that include NFTs based on that issue alone. 


&quot;Developers should be free to decide how to build their games, and you are free to decide whether to play them,&quot; Sweeney wrote, &quot;I believe stores and operating system makers shouldn&#x27;t interfere by forcing their views onto others. We definitely won&#x27;t.&quot;

Just over 2m consoles have been sold across Europe this year (excluding major markets of the UK and Germany), which represents a 21 percent drop year-on-year, reports GamesIndustry.biz.


In particular, PS5 sales have dropped almost 44 percent for the first half of this year, although it remains the second most popular console across the region.

                              <span>Nintendo has added three more classic games to its ever-growing library accessible via Switch Online.


First up is Daiva Story 6: Imperial of Nirsartia on NES. The sixth out of seven games in the Daiva series, it was released in 1986. In the trailer for this Switch Online update, Nintendo shared that players can input the password たたかう to jetpack straight into a side-scrolling space shoot-out.


Next in the line-up is Fighter&#x27;s History, an arcade fighting game released in 1993 which was then ported to SNES the next year.

                              <span>Pre-orders are now live for the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, with a new trailer showing fresh footage of Lady Dimitrescu in action.


The Winters Expansion DLC builds on the Mercenaries mode and gives players the chance to play as both the iconic Lady D and villainous Karl Heisenberg, as well as Chris Redfield.


That means swinging a giant hammer, manipulating metal, and throwing chairs - check it out in the trailer below.

                              <span>Gotham Knights really does kill off Batman, its developer has told fans at San Diego Comic-Con. 


Some fans had suspected the game - which sees you playing as Bat sidekicks Robin, Red Hood, Nightwing and Batgirl following the apparent demise of the Dark Knight - would somehow fake Bat&#x27;s death so he could return later.

                              <span>Following today&#x27;s news that Ubisoft&#x27;s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandorahas been delayed and will no longer release along James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar sequel this December, the publisher has announced a number of other significant changes to its release roster, with Splinter Cell VR and Ghost Recon Frontline now officially cancelled alongside two previously unannounced games.


Ubisoft shared the news during its latest earnings call, only saying it had made the decision to cancel all four titles after taking into account the &quot;more uncertain economic environment&quot;.


Ghost Recon Frontline, which received a less-than-stellar reception when it was announced last October, was to be a new free-to-play instalment in Ubisoft&#x27;s long-running military shooter series. The core experience would have featured a large-scale, battle-royale-style 102-person mode where teams of three players completed objectives before calling for extraction, but other modes were also detailed.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing NFTs - and the video game industry&#x27;s continued interest in trying to sell them to us.

The past 24 hours have seen two major NFT announcements from a pair of companies taking radically different stances. On the one hand, there&#x27;s Square Enix, which has decided to celebrate the venerable Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s 25th anniversary by launching a range of NFT mechandise. This announcement, its fair to say, has gone down like cold sick. 

On the other hand, there&#x27;s Mojang - the Microsoft-owned maker of Minecraft - which has drawn a line in the sand and said it will not integrate NFTs or allow others to use Minecraft in order to sell them. Is this end for video game NFTs? Unlikely! But as the planet burns, what does the future hold? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

                              <span>Bungie has said it&#x27;ll be giving fans to &quot;witness what&#x27;s next&quot; for Destiny 2 as part of a developer showcase scheduled to air on 23rd August.


While Bungie&#x27;s official announcement didn&#x27;t share specifics about the livestream, the developer has already been extremely forthcoming regarding the next few years for Destiny 2, so it&#x27;s almost certain August will see the developer showcasing its previously announced, but still mysterious, Lightfall expansion.


Revealed back in June 2020, Lightfall - which is currently expected to launch sometime in 2023 - will be Destiny 2&#x27;s penultimate expansion, coming between this year&#x27;s The Witch Queen and the game&#x27;s finale expansion The Final Shape. Bungie previously confirmed the latter will bring Destiny&#x27;s Light and Darkness Saga to a close.

                              <span>Steam Early Access smash hit Vampire Survivors has just received its newest patch, bringing the game one step closer to its full 1.0 release.


Patch 9.0,  nicknamed &quot;The Flashy One&quot; by developer Poncle, adds one character, a bonus challenge stage called Boss Rash, four achievements, two Arcanas, and a new hidden game mechanic as well as minor tweaks and bug fixes.
Boss Rash, as the name suggests, is a boss rush stage, and new Arcanas Gemini and Twilight Requiem allow players to further experiment with their playstyle.

                              <span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft&#x27;s movie tie-in from The Division developer Massive Entertainment, has been delayed. 


The game will now launch in &quot;2023-24&quot;, Ubisoft confirmed this afternoon, as part of its first quarter of 2022 financial results. 


This seemingly means a shift back to the publisher&#x27;s next financial year, meaning we won&#x27;t see Avatar now until after 31st March 2023.

                              <span>Rockstar has announced the next major expansion for Grand Theft Auto Online, and it hits a little too close to reality. 


The Criminal Enterprises expansion, which released on 26th July, sees the Southern San Andreas economy in crisis, with petrol prices at their highest levels in decades, supply chains in turmoil and a heatwave to top it all off. 
Sounds a little too familiar to be a satire if you ask me.

                              <span>At TwitchCon Amsterdam, streaming giant Twitch announced a number of new safety features coming soon to the platform.


This includes the ability for streamers to customise who can &quot;raid&quot; them, plus the ability to share a list of banned accounts with other streamers. Both of these features are in response to the mass wave of hate raids that affected marginalised streamers last year.



The features were introduced at the opening ceremony by Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: &quot;We&#x27;re never going to be done with safety on Twitch, it&#x27;s a goal without end.

The organisation of esports professionals and gaming influencers has begun trading on the Nasdaq to become one of only a few esports companies on the market.


However, when FaZe agreed last October to merge with acquisition company B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Corp., it was valued at close to $1bn. Now that value is closer to $716m.

                              <span>An official Detroit: Become Human manga series is launching on 22nd July in Japan.
Titled as Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories, the comic will follow the story of Japan&#x27;s own android revolution.


A short synopsis and some panels have been released on Famitsu in Japanese. The story is set in 2038 and stars Reina, an android idol. It seems that Tokyo Stories takes place alongside the original story of Detroit: Become Human, contrasting the largely hostile attitudes to androids seen in the game with a society that is much more accepting of them.

The device - officially named the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector - slotted into your PC and provided internet access to the Nintendo DS.


However, continued use now risks your computer being targeted by &quot;unauthorised access&quot; or &quot;infection of the computer terminal&quot; with a virus, Nintendo has now cautioned.

Today, the internet is awash with all sorts of new information about the game, including details about its accessibility options and control layout.

The appearance of Specialists was one of the early criticisms levelled by players, who felt their clean look and rather light-hearted demeanour did not fit with the game&#x27;s harsh post-climate change apocalyptic world. 


Based on rendered images posted by the developer, the Specialists have a more gritty look, with burly beards and a more serious resting face reflecting the mental scarring of warfare.

                              <span>Minecraft has drawn a red line around the use of NFTs inside and adjacent to Microsoft&#x27;s hugely-popular survival sandbox game, effectively banning their use.


Last night, Minecraft developer Mojang posted a blog laying out a clear policy on NFTs, which it said created &quot;models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with our guidelines and the spirit of Minecraft&quot;. 


&quot;To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications, nor may Minecraft in-game content such as worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods, be utilised by blockchain technology to create a scarce digital asset,&quot; Mojang confirmed.

                              <span>Following January&#x27;s news that New Line Cinema is working on a sequel to last year&#x27;s commercially successful Mortal Kombat movie reboot, Deadline reports that project&#x27;s director, Simon McQuoid, will return to the helm for part two.


Last year&#x27;s movie followed the adventures of Cole Young, a former professional MMA fighter - and a new character to the series - who becomes ensnared in a plot by sorcerer Shang Tsung to eliminate the new generation of Earthrealm&#x27;s Mortal Kombat champions. Despite the return of plenty of familiar faces, and a strong opening fight (which you can see below), Eurogamer&#x27;s resident Mortal Kombat fan Wesley Yin-Poole wasn&#x27;t overly impressed by the end result.


Yet despite a generally lacklustre critical reception, the Mortal Kombat movie apparently did big numbers for New Line, opening at No. 1 at the US box office and ranking among the all-time top feature titles on HBO Max, where it simultaneously released. A sequel was almost inevitable then, and New Line confirmed its plans for a follow-up in January this year.

                              <span>Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley, who served as co-director on Uncharted 2, Uncharted 4, and the The Last of Us before leaving the games industry in 2017, has announced he&#x27;s returning to game development and is establishing a new studio, Wildflower Interactive, to do just that.


Straley broke the news of his return in a video shared on Twitter, explaining, &quot;In 2017, I left the industry not sure if I wanted to make games anymore, but the longer I was away, I kept thinking about this medium, and everything yet to be done and everything I wanted to do still - and this idea kept following me.&quot;


&quot;So I grabbed some friends,&quot; Straley continued, &quot;and we started prototyping and the idea started getting good, it started becoming exciting again, and I realised I need to make this game. But if I&#x27;m going to make this game, it means I have to build a team, and if I build a team, I have to build a company, and if we&#x27;re going to do that then we have to do it the right way.&quot;

                              <span>With just a few short weeks to go until Insomniac Games&#x27; superb Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump from PlayStation 5 to PC on 12th August, Sony has released new details on the game&#x27;s PC-exclusive features, plus full spec requirements so prospective purchasers can get a sense of how it&#x27;ll run on their machines.


Starting with the new features arriving as part of Spider-Man Remastered&#x27;s PC release, these&#x27;ll include (for those with compatible GPUs) ray-traced reflections at varying quality levels, plus support for Nvidia DLSS and DLAA. All players, meanwhile, can take advantage of Spider-Man&#x27;s customisable rendering systems, including SSAO, texture filtering, LoD quality, and shadows.

Additionally, there&#x27;s support for various monitor resolutions and ratios - including ultra wide, panoramic, and Nvidia Surround multi-monitor set-ups - all playable in either windowed, full-screen, or exclusive full-screen rendering modes.

                              <span>Lost Ark&#x27;s big July update has arrived, bringing with it, among other things, the new Arcanist advanced mage class, who gets things done by tossing magic cards about the place.


Alongside the Arcanist, July&#x27;s update (officially titled Spells in Spades) introduces a new ultra-tough Inferno difficulty version of the Valtan Legion raid - which requires item level 1445 to participate in - plus tougher Challenge Abyssal Dungeons. This twist on standard Abyssal Dungeons is a weekly activity that, like the updated Valtan Legion raid, will feature its own increased rewards for players able to overcome its challenges.


It&#x27;s undoubtedly the Arcanist that&#x27;s taking centre-stage though, and she joins the Bard and Sorceress as Lost Ark&#x27;s third available Mage Advanced Class. Using special cards imbued with Magick, she&#x27;s able to deploy them in multiple ways, summoning powerful attacks from within the cards or simply using them in massive numbers to slice up foes.

That means FIFA 23 on PC benefits from all the new HyperMotion 2 (yes, FIFA features have sequels now) gameplay, new animations and graphics improvements.

                              <span>FIFA 23&#x27;s big new gameplay feature is a power shot.


The power shot, which is available across generations (so, for example, PS4 and PS5), is a new skill-based, risk versus reward shooting mechanic.


EA wanted to introduce more skill to shooting, the company said during a recent presentation attended by Eurogamer, so in FIFA 23, if you carve out enough space for yourself and aim precisely, you can score impressive-looking goals that have more power and accuracy, but with the risk of a longer animation.

                              <span>FIFA 23 on Nintendo Switch is once again a &quot;Legacy Edition&quot;, EA has confirmed.


In news that is perhaps unsurprising, FIFA 23 on Switch, due out 30th September, is basically the same as FIFA 22 on Switch.


As EA puts it in its own words: &quot;Gameplay features and modes will have parity with FIFA 22 on Nintendo Switch and will feature the same gameplay from FIFA 22 Legacy Edition without any new development or significant enhancements.&quot;

Blizzard&#x27;s Diablo Hell&#x27;s Ink takeover event began in Los Angeles on Saturday and will continue until 10th September. During this time, fans can get a free Diablo tattoo, whilst also nabbing their beta access and digital copy of the game in the process. 


The campaign will hit eight cities in total, across North America, Europe and Australia, with each pop-up opening for one day only. A competition ran in June which gave fans the chance to win a custom Diablo tattoo, but anyone who missed out on one of those can still get involved.

Freighters were, of course, one of No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s very first post-launch additions, arriving all the way back in November 2016 as part of its game-changing Foundation Update.


While the Foundation Update&#x27;s other major addition, base building, has undergone several revisions in the year&#x27;s since its debut, freighters - those giant, habitable, expandable space vessels Travellers are now given early on in their adventures - have not, and their limited building blocks have remained an ongoing frustration for players like me who&#x27;ve long dreamed of constructing something a bit more lavish for their home among the stars.

                              <span>Netflix lost almost a million subscribers over the past three months, the company has revealed, although this was not as many as it had feared - having forecasted a drop of two million subscribers previously. 

In Netflix&#x27;s latest financial results, the streaming giant revealed that despite airing new seasons of front-runner Stranger Things and other popular series such as The Umbrella Academy.  


In the UK, the cost of living crisis is one of the biggest issues currently faced by households, and streaming services are feeling the impact of it. The BBC  reported that many people are choosing to cancel their subscriptions in order to compensate for increasing bills and prices. Netflix is likely one of the companies affected by this, with 300,000 of the total 970,000 subscribers lost residing in the EMEA region.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Avengers looks to be getting a selection of beachwear skins, because of course it is. 


Summer designs for Thor, Black Widow and Tony Stark have been unearthed in a new datamine of the game, from reliable leaker Miller (thanks, MP1st).


Square Enix is yet to announce the skins officially - and of course, being in the game&#x27;s files doesn&#x27;t guarantee they will be released.

                              <span>Soulsborne players will be familiar with gargoyle enemies, which recur throughout the games.


Usually they&#x27;re made of stone but in Elden Ring, they appear to be made of conjoined human flesh. Lovely!


YouTuber Zullie the Witch has made this latest grotesque discovery, zooming in on the Valiant Gargoyles bosses.

                              <span>Naughty Dog officially announced its plans to bring The Last of Us Part 1 to PlayStation 5 (and eventually PC) with a shiny new remake that will be a &quot;total overhaul of the original experience&quot; at Summer Game Fest last month.
The remake itself is not due out until September, however, we are already seeing gameplay leaks making their way out into the wild. Déjà vu anyone?
The most recent leaks, which have now been mostly removed from the internet by a very fast-moving Naughty Dog, showed off a scene from very early in the game&#x27;s narrative.

                              <span>Valve has detailed how the current heatwave will affect its Steam Deck hardware, which will shut down completely in high temperatures. 


Even before this happens, performance will be &quot;throttled&quot; when the hardware is hot, Valve has said. Honestly, after the past couple of days, I can relate. 


&quot;For our friends in the midst of a heatwave, a quick note about Steam Deck in high temperatures,&quot; Valve wrote via Twitter last night. &quot;Steam Deck performs at its best in ambient temperatures between zero and 35°C. If the temperature gets higher than this, Steam Deck may start to throttle performance to protect itself.&quot;

The group, named GWA Albany, has said it is pushing for fairer pay, improved healthcare benefits and more transparency in addressing workplace issues. 


Addressing crunch is another key demand, with staff asking for the establishment of &quot;reasonable protocols&quot; to address times when they are asked to work extended hours.

In fact, it has become the biggest PC launch ever for publisher Annapurna Interactive (which I feel should rename itself Anna-purr-na for the occassion).
At the time of writing, there are 34,139 players on Steam making their four-legged way around Stray&#x27;s environments, with an overall peak of 62,963.
Figures posted by Steam tracker Benji-Sales show a launch far higher than other recent Annapurna titles.

                              <span>The Russian hacking group Turla released an Android app that seems to aid Ukrainian hackers in their attacks against Russian networks. It’s actually malware, and provides information back to the Russians:
The hackers pretended to be a “community of free people around the world who are fighting russia’s aggression”—much like the IT Army. But the app they developed was actually malware. The hackers called it CyberAzov, in reference to the Azov Regiment or Battalion, a far-right group that has become part of Ukraine’s national guard. To add more credibility to the ruse they hosted the app on a domain “spoofing” the Azov Regiment: cyberazov[.]com...</span>

                              <span>Xbox veteran and Halo Infinite head of design Jerry Hook has unveiled his new &quot;AAA&quot; studio Jar of Sparks, a first-party developer for Chinese publisher NetEase that will focus on creating the &quot;next generation of narrative-driven action games&quot;.


Hook, who announced his departure from 343 Industries and Microsoft back in May, has a long and notable career in the games industry, having joined the Xbox Live team in 2003. He would later take on an executive producer role at Microsoft after a brief sojourn at Bungie, gaining credits on numerous 343-Industries-developed titles including Halo 4 and Halo 5: Guardians.


Hook&#x27;s new studio, Jar of Sparks, is based in Seattle and, according to NetEase&#x27;s press release announcing the formation of the company, already boasts a &quot;team of industry veterans who have worked on some of the biggest franchises in video game history&quot;.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long and eventful road for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, but despite its troubled development, which has included the removal of its original developer Hardsuit Labs, Paradox Interactive has popped up to assure fans that work continues on the project, although it won&#x27;t be shown at the publisher&#x27;s upcoming PDXCon.


Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, a sequel to developer Troika Games&#x27; much-loved 2004 cult-classic RPG, was initially announced for PC and consoles back in 2019, when it was expected to release the following year. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t take long for the project to run into trouble and, later in 2019, Hardsuit Labs announced the first of several delays.


By the end of 2020, lead narrative designer Brian Mitsoda and creative director Ka&#x27;ai Cluney had been fired from their roles, senior narrative designer Cara Ellison had quit the project, and Paradox had revised Bloodlines 2&#x27;s release date once more, pushing it into 2021. Then, things went from bad to worse; as 2021 got underway Paradox announced it had removed Hardsuit from the project, delayed the game indefinitely, and cancelled new pre-orders.

                              <span>Three weeks after the US Supreme Court overturned key legislation granting individuals the constitutional right to choose an abortion, Take-Two Interactive - which publishes the likes of Grand Theft Auto, Borderlands, BioShock, Mafia, and XCOM through its various subsidiaries - has issued a statement saying it &quot;acknowledges&quot; the decision &quot;is a significant event&quot;.


Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s overturning of Roe v Wade at the end of June, publishers and developers around the world - including Microsoft, Ubisoft, EA, Bungie, Naughty Dog, Double Fine, and Bethesda - released statements in support of reproductive rights. Take-Two was one of the few major publishers, alongside Activision Blizzard, not to respond publicly to the news.


Three weeks on, though, Take-Two has now released its own statement across a limited number of social media channels, including its own LinkedIn page and subsidiary Zynga&#x27;s Twitter feed.

Twitch Charity will allow streamers to select a charity, set a fundraising goal and collect donations from subs and Bits all from within the creator dashboard. Twitch does not take a cut of donations or receive any tax incentives.


The US-only closed beta is available now for selected streamers and for a limited number of charities, with the aim to roll it out globally across the platform soon.

                              <span>Legendary game maker John Romero - best known for his work on developer id Software&#x27;s seminal run of 90s shooters including Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake - has announced he&#x27;s working on a new FPS in collaboration with an as-yet unnamed &quot;major publisher&quot;.


Romero shared the news in a statement posted to Twitter, revealing the project is being handled by Romero Games - which most recently worked on mafia strategy title Empire of Sin for publisher Paradox Interactive - and that it would be built around an &quot;original, new&quot; IP.


Beyond that, details are thin - the official FAQ says &quot;it&#x27;s way too early to share any other information&quot; - with the remainder of the announcement only noting Romero Games is currently hiring across a range of positions for its new FPS, and that it&#x27;s particularly keen to hear from those with experience using Unreal Engine 5.

The main component of the set is the life-size replica model of the console, but that&#x27;s not all.
The 2532-piece kit will also include a joystick, three game cartridges, and a small diorama display for each of the games included.

The launch of the game on these devices will bring with it improved HD visuals and framerates, with faster loading times to &quot;keep players dishing out eye-popping ultraviolence&quot; throughout (how lovely).
To accompany this announcement, we also got a nice shiny new trailer to pour over. This is full of beam katanas, a general sense of mass destruction and Travis&#x27; cat Jeane - what&#x27;s not to love?! You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>Set photos from Amazon&#x27;s upcoming TV adaption of Fallout have begun to circulate online. 
Yesterday, Collider published photos taken by a reader from Staten Island in New York. 


The photos show the exterior set of a Super Duper Mart with some sleek, round-bodied cars ripped straight from the 1950s parked outside, rusted all over. The building itself isn&#x27;t doing much better, sporting the grime and abandoned wear you would expect to see roaming around Fallout 4&#x27;s post-apocalyptic Boston.

This free update, which will be available on 21st July, will also bring a new stadium called Desert Ruin and additional Knight gear to tackle the game&#x27;s frantic football frays (say that three times quickly after a few drinks!).

Shared by Famitsu, mixed martial artist Mikuru Asakura recently uploaded a video in which he visited Sega&#x27;s development headquarters. 
His tour of the studio is interesting enough, but what has caught most people&#x27;s attention is that within this video we also get our first look at Ichiban Kasuga (Like a Dragon&#x27;s protagonist), Koichi Adachi and Yu Nanba in Yakuza 8. You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>We don&#x27;t know when Return to Monkey Island will be landing on our shores, but we do know that it will be sometime this year. In anticipation of this release, its developers have been sharing little snippets of what we can expect, with the most recent one giving us a closer look at Melee Island&#x27;s dock, an eerie-looking ship and the outside of the Scumm Bar. 
&quot;New surveillance video for #MonkeyIslandMonday!,&quot; tweeted developer Dave Grossman. &quot;Strange man seen striding purposefully on Melee dock, ignoring the pelicans and bar as though he had somewhere to be, some devilish puzzle to solve...&quot;
That strange man is, of course, none other than series hero Guybrush Threepwood. Can you believe he passed up the opportunity to quench his thirst with a healthy pint of grog? Something must be afoot.

                              <span>BAFTA Award winner Inscryption now has a release date on PlayStation. Publisher Devolver Digital has announced that the deck-builder roguelike game will be out on 30th August on PS4 and PS5.
As we&#x27;ve previously reported, the game will have PlayStation-exclusive features, such as haptic feedback, to ensure you feel the weight of every card you play.
This marks Inscryption&#x27;s first release on consoles, so if you haven&#x27;t given it a try yet, we would highly recommend it. The game earned an Essential rating from Bertie in Eurogamer&#x27;s Inscryption review when the game first released last year on PC.

Vikander, who took on the axe wielding, bow and arrow shooting role of Lara Croft in the most recent Tomb Raider film, spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the sequel, saying that she has &quot;no clue&quot; how things will go from here. &quot;With the MGM and Amazon buyout... its kind of politics,&quot; she explained. 
That being said, Vikander is just waiting for the sequel to be given the green light once more. &quot;I think Misha [Green, who is currently attached to the project as its writer and director] and I have been ready, so it&#x27;s kind of in somebody else&#x27;s hands, to be honest,&quot; she shared.

The player, Luca Leone, regularly streamed the game using cheats on his Twitch channel miffysworld, for which Bungie repeatedly banned him. Leone created 13 separate accounts in an attempt to evade bans, with each account violating the game&#x27;s Limited Software License Agreement.


Leone sent threatening messages from his Twitter account, about his desire to &quot;burn down&quot; Bungie&#x27;s offices and declaring certain Bungie employees were &quot;not safe&quot; as he intended to move to their neighbourhood - including community manager Dylan Gafner.

                              <span>There had been rumblings amongst the gaming community that Motion Twin&#x27;s roguelike Dead Cells was coming to the end of its lifespan. Thankfully, this is not the case. Rather, the developer has released a new roadmap for the game that covers the rest of this year, and into 2023.
So, what can you expect to see heading your way? Well, for summer 2022, Dead Cells players should see the arrival of &quot;the long awaited panchaku&quot; as well as a new &quot;flame head outfit based on our beloved animated trailers&quot;. There will also be some rebalancing for various weapons and other items, but most endearingly you will soon be able to &quot;pet the pets&quot;.
Following this, autumn will see a new Boss Rush area enter the game. As with boss rush modes from other games (looking at you Metroid Dread), this area will let you test your metal against a series of Dead Cell&#x27;s bosses one after the other. As you progress, you will unlock new items to help you on your way.

Specially &#x27;oddtimised&#x27; to run on the Switch&#x27;s hardware, the game follows series protagonist Abe after the events of Oddworld: New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty. 
Although the release date hasn&#x27;t been announced yet, preorders are now open for the physical Limited and Collector&#x27;s Odditions, the latter of which includes an exclusive nine-inch figurine of Abe and a 160-page artbook. Any pre-orders from participating retailers of the Limited or Collector&#x27;s Odditions will also include the game&#x27;s OST and a digital artbook. Sounds like some tasty goodies for any Oddworld fans.
In our Oddworld: Soulstorm review, Christian Donlan felt the game&#x27;s magical moments and brutal setting were well worth the few rough edges. With the UK currently feeling the effects of climate change, perhaps this is a good time to revisit a game where you can live out your fantasy of destroying a means of capitalist production.

                              <span>If you found yourself impressed by Lego&#x27;s recently unveiled Mighty Bowser set but couldn&#x27;t quite shake the feeling something was missing - say, around 13ft - then Nintendo has you covered. As part of San Diego Comic-Con, the company has constructed an absolute behemoth Mighty Bowser, measuring over 14ft tall.


The retail version of Mighty Bowser is, of course, already pretty sizeable, weighing in at 2,807 pieces, making it the largest Lego Mario adult set yet. However, the San Diego version absolutely crushes that like a sudden Thwomp to the bonce, utilising over 663,900 bricks to create its magnificent heft.


And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the 14-ft tall version is even articulated, able to move its thumbs, shift its arms, swivel its head and eyes indepently, and waggle its eyebrows for good measure. You can see the (slightly intimidating) thing in action below.

                              <span>Just as Netflix&#x27;s live-action Resident Evil series finds itself flung unceremoniously onto the &#x27;disappointment&#x27; pile, news arrives of another video game being adapted for television - this time in the form of Obsidian&#x27;s inch-high garden adventure Grounded.


Released into early access back in July 2020, Grounded adapts the familiar gathering-and-crafting survival formula into a rollicking family friendly adventure inspired by the likes of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and A Bug&#x27;s Life. Here, players are miniaturised and sent on a conspiracy laden escapade around their now-towering backyard, forced to fend off giant insects and other creatures as they explore, scavenge, and plot their escape.


According to Deadline, Grounded&#x27;s new television adaptation will follow the same basic premise, telling the story of four friends who, the summer before high school, find their plans to elevate their social standing upended after discovering shrinking technology that makes them two inches tall. &quot;Now the four shrunken friends must learn to survive in a towering backyard that&#x27;s a jungle full of enormous predators,&quot; explains Deadline, &quot;and hiding a vast corporate conspiracy threatening their entire town.&quot;

                              <span>Fall Guys players have a phallic treat awaiting them in their inventories right now, with developer Mediatonic handing out troublingly elongated Tall Guys to one and all following its recent, widely publicised cock-up.


Fall Guys&#x27; Tall Guys disemination doesn&#x27;t, admittedly, appear to be directly related to the recent snafu - which saw players recieving snotty customer service responses after a bug in the game caused them to auto-buy cosmetics - but developer Mediatonic presumably won&#x27;t say no to the positive publicity right now.


One look at the image accompanying Mediatonic&#x27;s promise of a &quot;BIG surprise&quot; for all Fall Guys players on Twitter today makes it abundantly clear where the developer&#x27;s mind was at the time, but the good (?) news is the actual in-game Tall Guys are marginally less phallic than they appear in their promo material - as you can see below.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bit of bad news for anyone looking forward to the arrival of free-to-play arena shooter Star Wars: Hunters; developer Zynga has announced it&#x27;s delaying the game&#x27;s full release into 2023 in order to ensure it &quot;meets the high expectations we are setting&quot;.


This isn&#x27;t the first delay for Star Wars: Hunters, of course; announced back in February 2021 for Switch, iOS, and Android, the game was originally expected to launch later that year, but eventually saw its full release pushed into 2022. Zynga has, however, managed to soft launch the game in select territories in the interim, so there are at least some players who&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try it in that time.


Announcing a second delay for the game&#x27;s full release on Twitter, Zynga explained, &quot;We are working tirelessly to achieve our vision for Star Wars: Hunters. Our ambition is to create a competitive battle arena game that will entertain for years to come. To ensure we meet the high epgetation we are setting for fans globally and ourselves as developers we have made the decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters [to 2023].&quot;

                              <span>When Resident Evil Village released last year, there was one character that quite clearly (and also quite literally) stood head and shoulders above the rest - the towering and bewitching Lady Dimitrescu. She was on everything from beach towels to buses.
But while she may not have popped up in the series prior to Village, we could yet see her again elsewhere. Andrew Dabb, showrunner for Netflix&#x27;s divisive new Resident Evil series, is also a fan of Lady D, and has said he&#x27;d like to bring her to the TV adaptation in future seasons. 
Speaking to Polygon, Dabb revealed: &quot;Over the course of the series, I want to bring everything in... Left to my own devices, I want Lady D, I want the plant monster, I want it all.&quot;

The inclusion of Kerr, who plays for Chelsea and Australia&#x27;s women&#x27;s teams and is widely considered one of the best female footballers in the world, marks the first time a female FIFA cover athlete is included on an internationally-released version of EA Sports&#x27; long-running football game.


Kerr appearing on the FIFA 23 cover wearing a Chelsea kit suggests the inclusion of Chelsea FC Women and, following that, the Women&#x27;s Super League - the highest league of women&#x27;s football in England - in FIFA for the first time.

This includes upcoming maps and weapons, as well as details of Infinite&#x27;s Forge mode (thanks, LeaksInfinite/HaloDotAPI). Also, a mysterious object called the quantum translocator.


First up, here&#x27;s the fan-favourite and powerful DMR weapon, missing from Infinite until now.

                              <span>Nintendo has delayed the release of its Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Collector&#x27;s Edition for the UK and the EU until September. So, after the game&#x27;s launch which, in case you missed it, is 29th July.
The company cited &quot;unforeseen logistical challenges&quot; as the reason for this delay, before going on to apologise for any inconvenience this decision may have caused.
However, all is far from lost. If you had your heart set on this Collector&#x27;s Edition of the game, you will obvisouly still have the chance to purchase Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on its release. After that, you will be able to get your hands on this edition&#x27;s contents separately without the game itself.

Tomorrow&#x27;s new release As Dusk Falls, a stylish narrative adventure Eurogamer just recommended in its review, is also part of the list.


As Dusk Falls is the first game from new studio Interior/Night, which formed as a breakaway from the controversial Heavy Rain developer Quantic Dream. For more on all that, Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale recently visited the studio to sit down with its founder Caroline Marchal.

                              <span>We are not in short supply when it comes to video game to TV adaptations. As well as those already released, there are also numerous titles in the pipeline, from Fallout and The Last of Us to Horizon and God of War. There have even been talks of Life is Strange making its way to the live-action small screen. 
But one video game franchise that has already seen numerous adaptations is Resident Evil. We have been gifted with big budget live action films and CG miniseries over the years. 
Now there&#x27;s yet another take on the zombie-filled world of Racoon City, thanks to Netflix. This show follows Jade Wesker (daughter of series regular Albert Wesker) as she fights to survive in a world overrun by blood-thirsty infected creatrures. So, some pretty standard Resident Evil stuff. The being said though, this newest release doesn&#x27;t seem to be striking a chord with its viewers. In fact, it is one of Netflix&#x27;s lowest-rated shows ever.

It&#x27;s worth noting these trials are not available separately - you are essentially selecting to sign up to Extra/Premium via their various monthly/three-monthly/annual billing options, and just get seven days free up front.

                              <span>Ahead of its monumental acquisition by Microsoft, Activision now has an official publisher page on Steam.
In recent years, the company has favoured Battle.net for its PC games. However, this new page on Steam suggests that Activision is readying itself for the completion of the biggest deal in gaming history.
Fans of Activision&#x27;s various franchises have taken to forums such as Reddit and ResetEra to share their feelings about this move by Activision. In short, everyone is hopeful about what this might mean for the developer&#x27;s various games on PC (ahem, Tony Hawk).

                              <span>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted four unannounced factions in an official Total War: Warhammer 3 developer video released by Creative Assembly.


Skip to the 9:50 mark in the video below and you&#x27;ll hear the studio team discussing victory conditions, and see an exhaustive list of factions noted under the heading &quot;Domination Campaign Victory&quot;.


Intriguingly, this list includes four factions new to the Total War: Warhammer series and unannounced so far. These, fans reckon, are likely candidates for DLC in future.

                              <span>A new report states that Russia is looking into making its own game engine. This comes as support from other companies has been pulled following Putin&#x27;s barbaric invasion of Ukraine. 
The report by Kommersant (via PC Gamer) states that &quot;a number of major players in the Russian IT market including VK&quot; [Russia&#x27;s own Facebook alternative] are currently in talks with the Ministry of Digital Development to create a &quot;domestic game engine (a means of developing video games) and the possibility of allocating state funding for it.&quot;
Talks regarding this new engine began in May, when Russian developers allegedly voiced their concerns that they will soon have limited access to other engines such as Unreal or Unity. During these talks, the initiative was described as &quot;important and urgent&quot; for Russia&#x27;s video game developers.

                              <span>The developer of PowerWash Simulator has told players not to look at the sun, in order to avoid a game-crashing bug. 


This bug is linked to the game&#x27;s lens flare, developer FuturLab has said, and can occur on Xbox consoles when playing in multiplayer. 


Reducing the amount of time you look at the sun &quot;isn&#x27;t a great workaround&quot;, the developer admitted via a post to Twitter. But until a hotfix (sorry) is rolled out, it&#x27;s all there is. And, y&#x27;know, not looking directly at the sun is just solid advice in general.
