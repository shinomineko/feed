                              <span>We already knew that survival horror sequel Sons of the Forest was blowing up on Steam, but now we have the numbers to prove it.

That&#x27;s according to developer Endnight Games, which recently revealed that although the game is still in early access, it still managed to sell &quot;over two million copies in the first 24 hours&quot; since launch.

&quot;Thanks to those who have joined us in our Early Access journey into Sons Of The Forest,&quot; Endnight tweeted. &quot;We have sold over 2 million copies in the first 24 hours, and are very excited for what we have in store for players in the coming weeks.&quot;

                              <span>Cyanide Studios has posted a lengthy response to fans unhappy at the current state – and monetisation strategy – of Blood Bowl 3.

With just 27 per cent of players giving the game a thumbs up on Steam – that&#x27;s a 73 per cent disapproval rate amassed from almost a thousand players at this point – Cyanide outlined what &quot;players can expect [...] as we move forward&quot; as well as explore the &quot;sensitive topic&quot; of monetisation.

After thanking players for supporting the game, the team identified six main complaints: &quot;the monetisation, the Brutal Edition, the game state, the server issues, the Faction Leaks, and the Blood Bowl team&quot;.

                              <span>Blood Bowl 3 may have only just been released, but it&#x27;s already getting a kicking on Steam.

Cyanide Studio&#x27;s latest instalment comes eight years after Blood Bowl 2, but it seems as though some players don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been worth the wait. Right now, the self-proclaimed &quot;iconic death sport&quot; boasts a &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; aggregate rating on Steam – that&#x27;s a 73 per cent disapproval rate – amassed from almost 800 players.

&quot;I love Blood Bowl, but this game is a mess,&quot; said one unhappy player.

                              <span>EA wants to know if Dead Space fans would be interested in a Dead Space 2 or 3 remake.

As spotted by the folks at ResetEra, EA is currently polling selected players to ascertain exactly how interested they would be in a &quot;similar remake&quot; to Motive&#x27;s excellent reimagining of the original Dead Space game.  

Surprising? Not really, given the success of the first remake. But as some of the ResetEra commenters opine, Dead Space 3 may need &quot;some changes&quot; if it&#x27;s to reach the acclaim Dead Space Remake has achieved thus far.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play Brawlhalla has revealed it is adding real-time captioning to &quot;significantly boost accessibility in live stream gaming&quot;.

Teaming with Speechmatics, Ubisoft says Brawlhalla&#x27;s 80 million players make the game &quot;a prime title to demonstrate the value and importance of accessibility&quot;  and will be using Speechmatics&#x27; real-time speech-to-text API for all live streams, esports tournaments, and the game&#x27;s twice-weekly developer streams.

&quot;The integration of these Closed Captions follows the CEA-608 standard,&quot; Ubisoft explains in a statement. &quot;As a result, these Closed Captions are supported by a large portion of Over The Top (OTT) services, including but not limited to Twitch and Youtube.

                              <span>Medieval extraction looter, Dark and Darker, has scheduled another playtest in April.

The additional test comes ahead of the game&#x27;s Early Access launch towards the end of April or the beginning of May (as yet, Ironmace has not committed to a specific date).

After thanking the community for helping the game run its &quot;most successful playtest to date&quot;, the team said that because the &quot;recent playtest also gave [them] a lot of clues on how to proceed with development&quot;, it had &quot;decided to schedule another playtest prior to [its] Early Access launch&quot;.

In its sixth dev blog, this one entitled &quot;Back to the Beginning&quot;, senior producer Philippe Ducharme, art director Mike Yazijian, and creative director Roman Campos-Oriola reflected upon the project&#x27;s earliest days &quot;and its iconic inspiration&quot; to reveal how &quot;exactly&quot; the Dead Space remake &quot;came into being&quot;.

&quot;The Star Wars Squadrons team was starting to wrap up the game,&quot; said Ducharme, &quot;and they were looking for the next project. And Patrick [Klaus, General Manager of Motive] was brainstorming with the team leads, and one of them was Mike Yazijian, who was the art director for the Montreal portion of Dead Space 2. Mike was keen to make more Dead Space.&quot;

                              <span>Following a report in January that Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony would all be skipping this year&#x27;s efforts to revitalise a flagging E3, Nintendo has confirmed it won&#x27;t be attending the show.


In a statement provided to VentureBeat, Nintendo explained, &quot;We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year&#x27;s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.&quot;


It&#x27;s perhaps not entirely surprising news, of course, given Nintendo hasn&#x27;t held a major E3 conference for over a decade now, instead favouring its own Nintendo Direct broadcasts to convey its big news, and that the company last had a showfloor presence at E3 back in 2019.

New Zealand&#x27;s makeover marks the 12th World Update to release for Flight Simulator since its launch in 2020, and follows similar spruce-ups for - deep breath - Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.


World Update 12 brings similar additions to those seen in previous updates, meaning new high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery, plus improved digital elevation models. It also features seven new photogrammetry enhanced cities - Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton, Nelson, Queenstown, Tauranga, and Wellington - and nine new handcrafted airports.

                              <span>Last night&#x27;s Sony State of Play broadcast brought us a fresh look at the long-awaited Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and our first confirmation it will release for PlayStation 5 as well as PC. 


But what about Xbox? Had Sony splashed its cash and bought timed exclusivity? Or even full exclusivity?


Some viewers wondered if we&#x27;d hear about a version of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 for Microsoft&#x27;s consoles in due course, after Sony&#x27;s show concluded. After all, it&#x27;d be nothing new for console makers to keep mention of their rivals out of such events.

Well, however you choose to play Horizon Call of the Mountain, it turns out Aloy is a lot shorter than some players imagined. 


Players have been sharing screenshots on social media of the game and the series&#x27; protagonist does indeed look a little small. One player even gave her a little boop on the nose.

                              <span>The Day Before developer Fntastic is embroiled in a trademark dispute with a Korean calendar app of the same name, Eurogamer can confirm.


Earlier this month, Fntastic tweeted that videos of its forthcoming game had been removed from Steam and YouTube due to a trademark dispute. &quot;The so-called &#x27;owner&#x27; of the rights to the title is the creator of the calendar app, which has nothing to do with the games category,&quot; the studio said.



Now, in a response to Eurogamer, the developer of the calendar app has confirmed it holds the trademark rights to the app&#x27;s name &#x27;The Day Before&#x27; and is &quot;taking measures to protect trademark rights&quot;.

                              <span>Survival horror sequel Sons of the Forest is currently blowing up on Steam after its early access launch there yesterday.


Set on an island filled with cannibals and mutants where you must chop down trees and craft stuctures and weapons to survive, Sons of the Forest is the long-awaited sequel to the well-received The Forest.


Four years on from The Forest&#x27;s debut (and eight since it first launched via its own early access programme), this follow-up now sits comfortably on top of Steam&#x27;s list of best-selling games by revenue, above Company of Heroes 3 and Destiny 2, which is currently selling its new Lightfall expansion.

                              <span>One of the big surprises from Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play broadcast was the announcement of a virtual reality game based on Isaac Asimov&#x27;s much-loved sci-fi book series, Foundation.


Journey to Foundation, developed by Canadian studio Archiact, is due out on PSVR2, Meta Quest 2 and Pico 4 autumn 2023.


The announcement trailer, which begins with a quote from Asimov&#x27;s book, talks about the Empire falling and the galaxy plunging into 30,000 years of chaos and war. That&#x27;s very much the same setup as Asimov&#x27;s series, which revolves around a devastating prediction of humanity&#x27;s collapse by a maths genius called Hari Seldon. The Foundation itself is a group led by Seldon that attempts to limit the impact of this inevitable collapse by populating new, far-flung worlds. Suffice it to say, this plan does not go exactly to plan. Or maybe it does, if you&#x27;re Hari Seldon.

                              <span>Video game publisher Embracer has announced a new movie deal to put The Lord of the Rings back on the big screen. 


Embracer has had a mixed time of late, with its big budget Saints Row reboot failing to find an audience and its Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake from Aspyr reportedly being placed &quot;on pause&quot;.


For Embracer, this lucrative film deal with New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures is far more positive news. &quot;Multiple&quot; movies are planned, expanding on &quot;the revered works of JRR Tolkien&quot;, including elements from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

                              <span>Last night, during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play broadcast, Capcom revealed first looks at three Street Fighter 6 characters: Zangief, Lily and Cammy.


It&#x27;s fair to say Cammy&#x27;s reveal has drawn the most attention from the Street Fighter community. The popular British special forces operative has a new look for Street Fighter 6, which is going down well with fans, with more than a few nods to previous iterations of the character.


My favourite reference is to the much-loved 1994 Street Fighter 2 animated movie, which saw Cammy handstand on a goon&#x27;s shoulders, snap their neck, then drop down for a crunching leg attack (that last bit always felt like overkill to me - he&#x27;s already dead, Cammy!).

                              <span>The Legend of Dragoon fans are disappointed with the game&#x27;s bug-riddled port to current consoles.


The cult classic JRPG was added to PS Plus (and the PlayStation Store) this week, marking its digital debut in Europe.


However, fans have reported a string of bugs, and some have claimed the game is unplayable.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Call of Duty will be another Modern Warfare game, just a year after 2022&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2. 


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who detailed Activision&#x27;s upcoming entry in its annual shooter series in a report last night. 


This game was originally planned as a &quot;premium expansion&quot; for Modern Warfare 2, but is now being spun out into a full release, breaking the series&#x27; regular pattern of cycling through its various sub-brands.

Now, we have an answer. And it comes in the shape of Captain Pikachu, a new character set to star in the Pokémon franchise&#x27;s all new animated series set to debut later this year. 


Who is Captain Pikachu? This Pikachu wears what appears to be pilot&#x27;s hat, and is the partner Pokémon of another new character, a silver-haired chap named Friede.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft&#x27;s next steps to get its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout past regulators and over the finish line.

Earlier this week, Microsoft went to Brussels to argue its case with the European Commission, one of three major regulators still needing to be convinced - and Eurogamer was in attendance. It had agreements with Nintendo and Nvidia in its pocket, but only an unsigned contract with PlayStation. Was it enough? And if not, what else must Microsoft now do?
Does Microsoft still need to offer further concessions around Game Pass? Could we even see Microsoft let COD go onto PlayStation Plus to ensure full parity? Joining me to discuss all that and share our thoughts on whether we think the deal will finally get done are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Developer Motion Twin has dropped a few final teases for rogue-like action-platformer Dead Cells&#x27; paid Castlevania expansion ahead of its launch on 6th March, including the news it&#x27;ll let purchasers play as an unlockable Richter Belmont.


Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire have previously described Return to Castlevania as &quot;our very own love letter to the granddad of Dead Cells&quot;, and a newly shared gameplay trailer offers a closer look at some of many nods to Konami&#x27;s classic platform series players will encounter as they navigate the exterior and interior of Dracula&#x27;s Castle in the expansion&#x27;s two new biomes.


The big reveal, though, is that Return to Castlevania features a secret level which, once discovered, unlocks Richter Belmont as a playable character. Richter - who first appeared in 1993&#x27;s Castlevania: Rondo of Blood - comes equipped with his later Symphony of the Night moveset, and players are able to expand on that by breaking candles to unlock additional moves, such as a high jump, and new weapons.

Tonight, a launch trailer for Destiny 2: Lightfall showcased the long-awaited arrival of the Darkness at Earth, led by its gooey-headed big bad The Witness. 


Destiny&#x27;s heroes gear up to defend the planet, but it&#x27;s clear that their forces are outmatched - until the Traveller itself finally powers up and gets stuck in.

The surprise confirmation of NetherRealm&#x27;s next fighting game came without fanfare or a trailer, which you&#x27;d normally expect alongside the reveal of a big game such as a new Mortal Kombat.


There&#x27;s nothing so far on Mortal Kombat 12 from NetherRealm&#x27;s socials, or Warner Bros. Games, specifically. NetherRealm chief Ed Boon has yet to tweet about it either.

                              <span>Tokyo game studio THA, in conjunction with Tetris Effect developer Enhance, is releasing its long-in-the-works PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC crowd puzzler Humanity in May.


THA first started showcasing Humanity back in 2017, and it was re-announced, this time with ties to Enhance, two years later for an anticipated 2020 release on PlayStation 4/PSVR.


That obviously never came to pass, and now Humanity has been given a fresh airing during PlayStation&#x27;s latest State of Play livestream. It looks as dazzlingly chaotic as ever, as players - in the role of a Shiba Inu - shepherd huge crowds of purposeless people at the end of the world.

As previously leaked, the game will have a battle pass focused solely on providing further cosmetic customisation to the game&#x27;s four antiheroes:  Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and King Shark.


Rocksteady confirmed tonight that the game will also get new playable characters and missions post-launch as well. A new FAQ page confirms these will be made &quot;available at no cost&quot;.

On the monthly front, PlayStation Plus subscribers at all tiers - that is, Essential, Extra, and Premium - gain access to Battlefield 2042 (PS5/PS4), Minecraft Dungeons (PS4), and action-RPG Code Vein (PS4). All three will be available to claim between 7th March and 4th April.


Over in Sony&#x27;s rapidly expanding game catalogue - which is available to anyone that subscribes to PlayStation Plus&#x27; Extra or Premium tiers - March brings some cracking offerings.

That&#x27;s a little less than three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, and no less than 23 years after Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2.


Tonight we got a fresh glimpse at the game during Sony&#x27;s latest State of Play broadcast, which also revealed a new antagonist: a necromancer played by Whiplash and Spider-Man&#x27;s JK Simmons.

Synapse unfolds in an abstract black-and-white world that becomes streaked with violent neon hues as the action unfolds, and nDreams describes its run-and-gun gameplay as an evolution of its 2021 shooter Fracked. 


It&#x27;s all built around dual-wielding combat, enabling players to wield a gun in one hand and do an altogether different kind of damage using Synapses&#x27; &quot;1:1&quot; telekinesis system with the other.

Embark unveiled The Finals, which will be free-to-play on release, last September with an eye-catching reveal trailer showcasing its impressive central gimmick: the ability to thoroughly alter and destroy every arena in the game, including every building and item within it.


The whole thing is presented as a kind of The Running Man-style televised bloodsport, and each match will feature four teams of three players. The action isn&#x27;t limited to firearms either, and The Finals promises the likes of melee weapons, and even a foam gun with a range of practical uses.

                              <span>Forza Horizon 5 is revving up for a different kind of driving experience courtesy of its newly announced Rally Adventure expansion, coming to Xbox and PC on 29th March.


Rally Adventure, in case it wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious, is all about bringing what developer Playground Games calls the &quot;rally experience&quot; to Forza Horizon 5, and that means a trip to a rugged new map (nominally located north of the existing one) known as Sierra Nueva.


Here, racers can let loose, taking in the expansion&#x27;s new deformable terrain and kick-up effects system, as well as landmarks including new towns, a quarry (complete with overhead conveyor belts to drive on), and Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s first completely smash-able forest.

It&#x27;s been an astonishing eight years since Rocksteady released Batman: Arkham Knight. Now, we&#x27;re finally just a couple of months away from seeing what it&#x27;s been up to since. Tonight we&#x27;ll get an extended look, lasting about 15 minutes. 

Before that, Sony is treating us to a quick whizz through five VR games on the way to its newly-launched PlayStation VR2 headset. We&#x27;ll be commentating on all of that live - so do join us later to watch along together!

                              <span>This is really interesting research from a few months ago:
Abstract: Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. Delegation of learning has clear benefits, and at the same time raises serious concerns of trust. This work studies possible abuses of power by untrusted learners.We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate “backdoor key,” the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees...</span>

The news comes after a tough period for the looter shooter, which finally launched on Steam in January - four years after it came out.


In early February, Ubisoft announced it had delayed the planned 7th February launch of Season 11 due to a localisation issue.

The most recent episode of The Last of Us gave us a closer look at the mental impact Joel&#x27;s situation is having on him. On two occasions, Joel can be seen clutching his chest as the camera pulls in close and the noise around him distorts. He is having panic attacks.


In the first instance of this happening, Joel assures Ellie that it was just the cold air taking him by surprise. The second time, however, Joel is on his own, and is only &#x27;calmed&#x27; by the sight of a young woman who for a moment Joel imagines to be his daughter, Sarah.

Helpfully, you can now take your financial planning for this year one step further thanks to Steam, which has published the dates for all the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3645136358931000680

Steam sale dates are usually announced closer to when the sale begins, so this is a welcome update. The list includes dates for the four major seasonal sales, as well as Fest events dedicated to specific genres.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced a patch for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate that fixes a flickering issue in the game on PS5.
Syndicate originally came out in 2015 for PS4, Xbox One and PC, and is playable on PS5 through backwards compatibility. The visual issue has been present since the game launched on PS5, with many asking Ubisoft to provide a fix for a while.
Ubisoft released a patch today to address the problem, which will hopefully allow players to enjoy the game in comfort and worry-free of potential health issues which can arise from flickering lights.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide continues its long road to recovery - a significant new patch is now available to download.


Patch #4 - Blessings of the Omnissiah includes a long list of additions, changes and fixes for the four-player co-op action game, which currently sits on a &quot;mostly negative&quot; Steam user review rating for the last 30 days.


The hotly-anticipated Darktide launched on PC at the end of November, and while players generally agreed the core gameplay was enjoyable, it suffered from a raft of technical issues, performance problems and a lack of a meaningful crafting system.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 2 got the much-loved Gun Game mode this week - and players have discovered it uses the classic Call of Duty mini-map that&#x27;s absent from the rest of the game.


Call of Duty&#x27;s mini-map is always a talking point, but Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s iteration proved particularly divisive.


Unlike some previous Call of Duty games, Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s mini-map only shows enemy player dots when a UAV is active. This means it does not display red dots when enemy players sprint or fire their unsuppressed weapons.

                              <span>Batman Arkham developer Rocksteady has amped up the violence for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, a new 18 rating for the game has revealed. 


Suicide Squad has been rated in Singapore, where the country&#x27;s ratings board has detailed how the game contains strong scenes of violence, including &quot;a character with a blade impaled in the neck, another&#x27;s heart being ripped out, and a man being decapitated with blood spurting out of the neck stump&quot;.


Fans on reddit have noted how the rating board appears to reference specific moments of violence described in a previous plot leak for the game that included major deaths - which we won&#x27;t divulge here.

                              <span>Half-Life: Ray Traced, a new mod adding hardware accelerated ray tracing to Valve&#x27;s seminal first-person shooter, is now available to download following its reveal last summer.


Half-Life: Ray Traced is the work of modder Sultim Tsyrendashiev - who previously created similar, extremely well-received ray tracing mods for the likes of Series Sam 1, Doom, and Quake - and is based on another previous attempt at Half-Life ray tracing.


Introducing the project last year, Tsyrendashiev explained, &quot;Half-Life: Ray Traced integrates the real-time path tracing into the original Half-Life (1998). With the hardware accelerated ray tracing, it is possible to calculate global illumination, reflections, refractions, soft shadows and other visual effects with interactive framerates.&quot;

                              <span>Tohru Okada, the musician and music producer responsible for creating PlayStation&#x27;s iconic logo sound, has died aged 73.


Okada&#x27;s music career spanned decades and a wide variety of mediums including movies and anime, but he was perhaps best known in Japan as a founding member of influential rock band Moonriders, where he played alongside bandmate Keiichi Suzuki - who would go on to compose the music for Nintendo&#x27;s Mother series.


Okada&#x27;s own ties to gaming came primarily through his successful career composing for commercials. He notably wrote music for a series of very strange Crash Bandicoot adverts in the 90s (thanks Gamespot), but his most enduring - and immediately recognisable - contribution to gaming arrived through his work with PlayStation.

To date, New World&#x27;s monetisation (after an initial full-price purchase) has largely be focused around a cosmetics-based premium shop but, from March, players will have the option to purchase the new Season Pass&#x27; 100-tier paid reward track as part of a shift to a three-month seasonal release model. A free track will also be also available.


To progress through a Season Pass and unlock the likes of emotes, skins, gear, Boost Tokens, and &quot;other seasonal loot&quot;, players will need to earn Season XP by completing objectives in the new Season Journey, Challenges, and Activity Card. XP can also be accrued through Quests, Faction Missions, Town Projects, Expedition Bosses, Outpost Rush, 3v3 Arenas, and more.

Its conclusion:
Cyber defense assistance in Ukraine is working. The Ukrainian government and Ukrainian critical infrastructure organizations have better defended themselves and achieved higher levels of resiliency due to the efforts of CDAC and many others. But this is not the end of the road—the ability to provide cyber defense assistance will be important in the future. As a result, it is timely to assess how to provide organized, effective cyber defense assistance to safeguard the post-war order from potential aggressors...</span>

Xbox Game Pass Friends &amp; Family - which launched as a limited &quot;preview&quot; last September after months of speculation and rumours - gives up to five people access to all Game Pass Ultimate benefits at a significant discount compared to individual memberships.


For its initial pilot, the service was limited to Colombia and the Republic of Ireland but Microsoft confirmed more counties could be added to that meagre list in the &quot;next months&quot;. True to its word, the company has now expanded the plan&#x27;s availability into Chile, Hungary, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, and Sweden starting today.

PSVR 2 support arrives alongside a selection of new additions for all platforms in today&#x27;s Fractal update.


On the new stuff front, No Man Sky&#x27;s Fractal update will usher in a fresh limited-time Expedition, titled Utopia, shortly after release. This challenges Travellers to team up and rebuild an abandoned solar system for the mysterious Utopia Foundation.


By completing the Expedition&#x27;s various milestones, players can unlock a number of rewards, including the Fearsome Visor helmet, a new robotic drone companion, plus a new ship type known as the Utopia Speeder, capable of skimming across planet surfaces at high velocity.

This week, fans spotted a change to the description of the game&#x27;s remote raid passes - premium items introduced during the early days of the Covid pandemic to allow Pokémon Go players to take part in raid battles from afar.


That change noted players &quot;can join {0} Raids a day&quot;, with the ultimate number as yet unset. After word of the change spread, this description was then quickly removed.

What&#x27;s more, Sony has also not provided tracking information, leaving customers in the dark about when their PSVR2 will actually arrive.

On iPhone, Angry Birds will stay available - albeit under a new and instantly-forgettable name: &quot;Red&#x27;s First Flight&quot;.


Why? In a statement, Rovio suggests the original Angry Birds is simply too popular, and that players are too happy to spend the app&#x27;s one-off 79p price rather than download the brand&#x27;s many free-to-play sequels and spin-offs which contain further microtransactions.

                              <span>Valve has issued a stark warning to Dota 2 cheaters, while confirming it has permanently banned over 40,000 accounts using a &quot;honeypot&quot; tactic.


In a blog post published last night, Valve said it had banned accounts it found were using third-party software to cheat in its hugely popular MOBA over the last few weeks.


According to Valve, this software accessed information used internally by the Dota client that wasn&#x27;t visible during normal gameplay, giving cheaters an unfair advantage.

                              <span>Microsoft will not consider a version of its proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout where it cannot also get its hands on Call of Duty, company president Brad Smith has said. 


The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority regulator previously suggested Activision sell off Call of Duty first, in order to make Microsoft&#x27;s buyout more palatable amidst anti-competition concerns. 


Speaking yesterday in Brussels at a press briefing attended by Eurogamer, Smith said Microsoft didn&#x27;t &quot;see a viable path&quot; to a deal where Call of Duty was owned by someone else.

The astonishing sales success comes a year after the game&#x27;s explosive February 2022 launch.


FromSoftware&#x27;s Elden Ring was an immediate smash hit, shifting 12m copies in just over two weeks. By the end of March, sales had hit 13.4m. It was 16.6m by August.

                              <span>There&#x27;s some good news if your Forza Horizon 5 experience is starting to get a little grey around the edges; Microsoft and developer Playground Games will be announcing the open-world racer&#x27;s next expansion this Thursday, 23rd February.


This mysterious new addition will be Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s second paid expansion, following on from last year&#x27;s Hot Wheels update. That introduced what Microsoft called the series&#x27; &quot;most extreme tracks ever devised&quot; high above Mexico, as well as ten new vehicles.


There&#x27;s no real hint as to what Playground Games has in store for expansion number 2 - I gave a quick squint at the reveal announcement art and came away none the wiser - but Microsoft previously said it would add &quot;a new location, vehicles, and gameplay&quot;. Or maybe when you fire it up, it&#x27;ll just promise to give you a copy of Call of Duty for the next ten years.

Story Packs, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, are mid-sized expansions designed to expand Stellaris&#x27; narrative potential, and First Contact will be game&#x27;s fifth, following on from Leviathans, Synthetic Dawn, Distant Stars, and Ancient Relics.


This time around, the focus is on the experiences of pre-FTL civilisations, both from their point of view and the perspective of their observers. To that end, First Contact introduces a revamped Observation system bringing in elements of civilisation Awareness, Diplomacy, and Espionage, plus Insights that can be learned by observing civilisations uncorrupted by the wider galaxy.

                              <span>EA and Omega Force have released a first, much-needed patch to improve the PC performance of their hugely enjoyable monster battler Wild Hearts - but early reports from players suggest it hasn&#x27;t actually managed to fix performance very much.


Word of Wild Hearts&#x27; performance woes began to spread even before its official release last week, when EA Play early access players started reporting everything from low frame-rates and persistent stuttering to sluggish pop-in across all platforms.
In response, Omega Force pledged to address performance concerns, saying it was &quot;working continuously to improve performance and optimise the game&quot; on all platforms, and that it would be releasing a PC patch this week to fix a CPU bottleneck problem it claimed should &quot;improve performance across mid-high end CPUs&quot;.

First up is developer Free Lives&#x27; gladiatorial smash-&#x27;em-up Gorn, which launches on 16th March. Also due in March is Nock: Bow + Arrow Soccer, which, as its name suggests, blends archery and football for a spot of &quot;high-stakes&quot; sports action.


Next on the list is Arizona Sunshine studio Vertigo Games&#x27; Hellsweeper VR, an &quot;intense VR experience where earthly physics do not exist and gravity-defying movements become your new reality&quot;. This one&#x27;s coming &quot;later this year&quot;.

The announcement was made during a press conference in Brussels this evening that followed a hearing at the European Commission in which Microsoft made its case for the deal to regulators.

                              <span>Microsoft is holding a press briefing in Brussels to address the future of its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout attempt, due to begin at 5.45pm UK time. 


This evening&#x27;s briefing follows an crucial day in court for the company, as it sought to settle anti-trust concerns raised by the EU&#x27;s European Commission, one of several regulators around the world currently standing in the way of the buyout being allowed to go ahead as-is. 


Sony and other companies with an interest in the deal were also part of today&#x27;s court session - a closed hearing in which media were not allowed to attend. Join us now for live updates on how Microsoft frames the day - and what might be next for Xbox&#x27;s potentially industry-shaking deal.

                              <span>Sony has announced the first State of Play broadcast of 2023, set for this Thursday, 23rd February at 9pm UK time.


In a blog post, Sony outlined what fans can expect from the show, which features a deep dive into Rocksteady&#x27;s upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and the reveal of five upcoming PSVR2 games.


It sounds like this State of Play won&#x27;t go big on first-party PlayStation 5 games, however.

Mighty Doom is a cartoony top-down single-touch shooter featuring the new Mini Slayer character.


It&#x27;s set in the &quot;animated Doom universe&quot;, which I did not know was a universe until today.

                              <span>Blumhouse Productions - the movie company behind some of the last two decades&#x27; biggest horror movie hits - is establishing a new gaming division focused on publishing indie horror games for PC, consoles, and mobile.


Since its formation in 2000, Blumhouse Productions has been the brains behind a steady stream of successful horror movies and franchises - including Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, The Purge, and Get Out - and the company is now looking to bring its horror expertise to video games, with the creation of Blumhouse Games.


This new division will partner with independent game developers to produce and publish &quot;original, horror-themed games for console, PC and mobile audiences&quot; (thanks BloodyDisgusting), and will adopt a similar low-budget model to that of its movie wing, targeting titles with sub-$10m budgets.

Now, say what you want about AWS&#x27;s hiring practices, they certainly don&#x27;t hire people who aren&#x27;t intelligent. This intelligent person made the very reasonable determination that the best solution they had available to send me that half terabyte of data was to mail me a hard drive.

                              <span>Capcom has announced a $1m first prize for an upcoming Street Fighter 6 tournament.


The impressive cash win is part of a $2m prize pool for the next Capcom Pro Tour. It&#x27;s the biggest prize pool the series has ever seen, and probably the biggest single cash prize in fighting game history.


To put this into context, the prize pool for the 2022 Pro Tour and its final tournament, Capcom Cup 9, was just $300,000. Clearly, Capcom is throwing its weight behind Street Fighter 6, which doesn&#x27;t come out until 2nd June.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 11 fans have found a fun Easter egg nearly four years after the game launched.


This Easter egg hunt was kicked off by Aaron Davis, senior designer at NetherRealm Studios, in a tweet published in 2020.


&quot;For people who like hidden stuff in MK games, there&#x27;s something in MK11 I put in that hasn&#x27;t been found yet from what I can tell,&quot; Davis wrote.

At the time of launch for PS Plus, Sony stated the addition of trophy support for games in the Classic catalogue would be &quot;optional for developers&quot;. Since then, only some games have included trophies, although Super Stardust Portable was recently the first game to have trophies added retroactively.



Legend of Dragoon includes 47 trophies, including a coveted platinum, most of which are tied to story.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced it has finalised a 10-year agreement to launch Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms on &quot;the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity&quot;. 


The move is, of course, reliant on Microsoft&#x27;s precarious-looking $68.7bn deal to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard going through.


It&#x27;s not the first time we&#x27;ve heard of such an agreement. Indeed, Xbox boss Phil Spencer first mentioned a 10-year &quot;commitment&quot; with Nintendo for Call of Duty back in December. Microsoft has also tried to offer the same decade-long deal to PlayStation in a bid to calm its concerns over Xbox owning Activision Blizzard - but with little success.

                              <span>Developer IronOak Games has teased a little more of For the King 2 - the sequel to its wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure - with its latest trailer revealing a handful of new features including landboats and recruitable pets.


The original For The King was a bit of a treat, blending familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - into a light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure with some neat story generation through its myriad randomised narrative events.


Much of that core remains in place in For The King 2, but the sequel - which pits players against the kingdom of Fahrul&#x27;s tyrannical queen 20 years after the end of the first game - adds new biomes, expanded co-op for up to four players (now also available online), increased customisaton across classes, armour, and weapons, plus a new, more strategic lane-based combat system which is detailed more thoroughly here.

                              <span>Square Enix has pledged to finally address issues affecting its wonky Chrono Cross remaster, known as The Radical Dreamers Edition, in a new patch arriving this month - almost a year after its initial release on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.


Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition launched last April, offering players a gentle remaster of Square&#x27;s dimension-hopping 1999 PlayStation JRPG Chrono Cross, in which a teenage boy named Serge finds himself in an alternate reality where he died as a child.


While the game itself has been celebrated over the years - Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell called it an &quot;engrossing epic, mixing sadness, whimsy and a touch of cosmic dread&quot; when he reviewed The Radical Dreamers Edition last year - the remaster left a lot to be desired, with Digital Foundry coming away unimpressed by its performance on all platforms.

                              <span>Bloober Team has announced a June launch window for Layers of Fear - the Layers of Fear 1 &amp; 2 remake formally known as Layers of Fears - and shared a new trailer to coincide with the news.


Layers of Fear is being co-developed with Anshar Studios, and sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 for a spot of new-gen shininess, and reimagined as a single, generations-spanning &quot;psychedelic horror chronicle&quot;.


The first Layers of Fear game, which released back in 2016, charted the story of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece, while 2019&#x27;s Layers of Fear 2 told the tale of an actor making a movie onboard a labyrinthine ocean liner. Bloober&#x27;s remake(s) will revisit each protagonist&#x27;s respective unravellings, bringing new visuals, gameplay, and expanded plot lines said to &quot;cast a new light on the overarching narrative&quot;.

When questioned whether Ubisoft would be at E3 this year, Guillemot raised eyebrows by telling investors his company would be there &quot;if E3 happens&quot;. 


Ubisoft has now confirmed in a statement to GamesIndustry.biz that it will be in attendance with a &quot;strong line-up&quot; at E3 - which is being run for the first time this year by Eurogamer parent company Reedpop.

                              <span>The Intercept has a long article on the insecurity of photo cropping:
One of the hazards lies in the fact that, for some of the programs, downstream crop reversals are possible for viewers or readers of the document, not just the file’s creators or editors. Official instruction manuals, help pages, and promotional materials may mention that cropping is reversible, but this documentation at times fails to note that these operations are reversible by any viewers of a given image or document.
[…]
Uncropped versions of images can be preserved not just in Office apps, but also in a file’s own metadata. A photograph taken with a modern digital camera contains all types of metadata. Many image files record text-based metadata such as the camera make and model or the GPS coordinates at which the image was captured. Some photos also include binary data such as a thumbnail version of the original photo that may persist in the file’s metadata even after the photo has been edited in an image editor...</span>

                              <span>This weekend&#x27;s ticketed Pokémon Go Hoenn Tour event in Las Vegas received a poor reception - literally - due to phone network connectivity issues which left many unable to play, and which developer Niantic blamed on unexpected overcrowding.


Reports of problems at the event surfaced early on Saturday, local time, as the in-person gathering kicked off. Tickets sold out last month, with some 50,000 players signed up to attend. 


After hours of issues, Niantic stated that &quot;an additional 17,000 Trainers without tickets joined us at the park&quot;, causing the connectivity issues in the area. &quot;This led to Trainers disconnecting from raids, being unable to log in, and other issues with gameplay,&quot; the developer admitted.

                              <span>Lego has begun removing videos uploaded to YouTube which discuss a rumoured Legend of Zelda set, details of which have trickled out over the past few months. 


The rumoured set is said to feature the series&#x27; iconic Deku Tree, along with minifigures for Link and Zelda.


Images said to be of the set appeared online earlier this month, though their legitimacy could not be proven. Now, Lego has begun issuing copyright claims on YouTube videos discussing the set - a move seen to be confirmation the set is indeed real.

                              <span>Soviet city-builder PC game Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic has been struck by a DMCA copyright violation issued by an angry fan.


As a result, the game from Slovakian developer 3Division is currently unavailable to purchase on Steam and does not appear in searches, though is still playable by those who have already purchased it.


The claim has been made by a fan of the game who wanted to be included in the game&#x27;s credits, but has since gone rogue.

                              <span>The Last of Us episode six, known as &quot;Kin&quot;, reunites us with Joel and Ellie as they continue their search for Tommy and the Fireflies. 


After a definite pick up in action and episode five&#x27;s emotional finale, episode six reverts back to a slightly slower pace of storytelling with a heavier focus on character development and world building. 


The bulk of the episode once again uses Naughty Dog&#x27;s source material as a flexible framework - it remains true to the game&#x27;s core narrative, but adjusts and embellishes certain aspects of its story.

The entire book has been scanned and is now available to view online, after initially being posted on reddit. We won&#x27;t post the artwork here.


While there are no massive spoilers to be wary of, Zelda fans looking to experience Tears of the Kingdom completely blind should keep an eye out where they click from here on out.

The game has players controlling the infamous puppet - presumably shortened to P here - in a dark gothic setting that many have likened to Bloodborne.


The release announcement was made at IGN&#x27;s Fan Fest 2023, with a new trailer showing off the creation of some sort of robotic monstrosity.

That&#x27;s right. Just as we&#x27;re recovering from the grizzlies in Elden Ring, PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton is welcoming a &quot;lumbering pack of malice&quot;, too - polar bears.

&quot;Bears have moved onto Vikendi&#x27;s icy battlegrounds but they’re sheltering from the blizzard and hibernating for winter,&quot; the team teases. &quot;Players can invade their caves for valuable loot, but we all know what happens when you poke a sleeping bear.&quot;

The Anti-Theft Mode feature will make the devices invisible to Scan and Secure, the company’s in-app feature that lets you know if any nearby Tiles are following you. But to activate the new Anti-Theft Mode, the Tile owner will have to verify their real identity with a government-issued ID, submit a biometric scan that helps root out fake IDs, agree to let Tile share their information with law enforcement and agree to be subject to a $1 million penalty if convicted in a court of law of using Tile for criminal activity. So although it technically makes the device easier for stalkers to use Tiles silently, it makes the penalty of doing so high enough to (at least in theory) deter them from trying...</span>

                              <span>Octopath Traveler 2 is giving you the chance to try before you buy courtesy of a new free-to-play demo.

The demo - which lets you carry your progress over to the full game - allows you to explore &quot;corners of Solistia to your heart&#x27;s content&quot;, provided you can get all of your exploring done within three hours – yes, there&#x27;s a three-hour time limit. 

That said, there are eight protagonists to choose from, so once you hit your three-hour limit, you&#x27;ll be able to start over again for another three hours with a different character. Just make sure you don&#x27;t overwrite the progress you make with your favourite character.

&quot;We are working to reform our various personnel systems so that employees can maximise their respective potential in a comfortable working environment,&quot; Sega said (thanks, NME).

                              <span>Tencent - one of the world&#x27;s biggest game publishers - has scaled back plans to take on the metaverse with its own VR hardware.

According to a new report by Reuters, the Chinese company is set to trim back its plans and personnel by &quot;cut[ting] costs and headcount&quot; at its &quot;extended reality&quot; XR unit. It&#x27;s unclear how this will impact the 300 employees currently working in the department, which was only set up in June last year.

Whilst Tencent isn&#x27;t talking publicly about the changes beyond admitting that it was &quot;making adjustments to some business teams&quot;, sources close to the situation report that part of the issue is the lengthy process of making hardware profitable. Internal forecasting reportedly confirmed that developing and selling its own VR system is unlikely to become profitable for Tencent until 2027.

The update addresses a number of issues, including the grass draw distance on Epic Particle settings that Digital Foundry&#x27;s Alex recently reported. It also fixes the &quot;rare issue&quot; with music stopping during Biome entry, as well as problems with incorrectly detecting Ultrawide monitor setups and Windows resolutions on the first boot, too.

You should also find that the PSN sign-in time outs have also been fixed, along with Benchmark results rounding error.

                              <span>Ubisoft has peeled back the lid on Rainbow Six siege&#x27;s Year 8 Season 1, Operation Commanding Force, which introduces new features, a new Operator, and &quot;further anti-toxicity measures&quot;.

The new season also ushers in the game&#x27;s all-new Mousetrap feature, which means players jumping onto console when using a mouse and keyboard will &quot;activate a penalty that adds lag to their inputs&quot;.

&quot;The goal of this penalty is to encourage fair gameplay by removing the unfair advantage that mouse and keyboard players have on consoles,&quot; Ubisoft explains. &quot;While active, continued use of mouse and keyboard gradually increases the lag over several matches, making it harder to aim and shoot. Completing matches with a controller will gradually reduce the lag back to normal.&quot;

Diablo 4&#x27;s open beta and early access are split across two weekends, starting with early access from 17th to 19th March. This session is exclusive to players that pre-purchase Diablo 4, while the open beta - which runs from 24th to 26th March - will be available to everyone.


Blizzard says the two sessions will offers players a &quot;deep look into the early game including the Prologue and the entirety of Act 1&quot;, and a level cap of 25 will be in place. More details are set to be shared during a developer livestream scheduled for 28th February.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but acclaimed viking survival adventure Valheim finally has a release date on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass, with developer Iron Gate Studios confirming it&#x27;ll be hitting Microsoft&#x27;s console on 14th March.


Valheim, of course, took the PC gaming world by storm when it launched into Steam early access back in February 2021, selling 4m copies in just three weeks and nearly 7m by July that same year. Despite its huge success, Iron Gate has continued to take its time with Valheim, and it wasn&#x27;t until November last year that the game received the first of several promised biome expansions in the form of Mistlands.


As such, there&#x27;s a long way to go until Valheim is ready for its 1.0 release, and the studio recently confirming its next biome expansion, the volcanic Ashalnds, is still in &quot;pre-production&quot;.

                              <span>Tetris Effect: Connected - the multiplayer-enhanced version of Eurogamer&#x27;s Game of the Year 2018 - is getting four new game modes next week as part of its Winter Update.


Tetris Effect, if it&#x27;s somehow escaped you, takes the classic block-dropping action of the seminal puzzler and cranks up the hypnotic allure by turning the whole thing into a shimmering, pulsating light and sound show in which everything syncs to the gorgeous music.


Tetris Effect: Connected became the de facto version in 2021, chucking in cross-platform multiplayer support for competitive and co-op play as it made the jump to non-VR devices, and the game is set to expand a little further with the aforementioned new modes next week.

                              <span>Strategy focused developer Firaxis has confirmed it&#x27;s working on a new entry in its long-running Civilization series, with the announcement arriving alongside the news that XCOM and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns designer Jake Solomon is leaving the studio after 23 years.


The announcement comes as Firaxis promotes Heather Hazen, previously the its chief operating officer, to the position of studio head. Hazen replaces Steve Martin, who served as Firaxis&#x27; president and studio head for nearly 17 years.


In a statement accompanying the news, Hazen said, &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled to have this opportunity to carry on the studio&#x27;s storied legacy, beginning with the announcement that Firaxis is in development on the next iteration of the legendary Civilization.&quot; Details on the project are thin, but the developer has confirmed Ed Beach, who lead the design of 2016&#x27;s Civilization 6, will serve as creative director on the new game.

                              <span>Last year, it was announced Liam Hemsworth would be taking over the role of Geralt from Superman actor Henry Cavill for the fourth season of Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher adaptation.


This turn of events took many by surprise, especially given Cavill&#x27;s clear passion for the series&#x27; source material. Some still find it hard to believe that the season three finale will be the last time we see Cavill straddling Roach and riding off into the sunset (or some sort of equivalent, this is The Witcher after all).


However, thanks to a recent deepfake video, we can get a better idea of how Hemsworth will look in his new The Witcher role.

The Far Northern Attire is an in-game costume consisting of headpiece, tunic, gloves, bottoms and boots, available to purchase in the game&#x27;s online store for £11.16.


However, the Saami Council has claimed the outfit uses the cultural property of the Sámi - a group of indigenous people from parts of northern Scandinavia.

                              <span>In a time where it seems every video game under the sun is getting its own adaptation of some sort, be it live-action TV series, full feature film or an episodic anime, we now have our first look at yet another one. And, you could say, things are falling into place for this particular film.


Tetris, starring Kingsman&#x27;s Taron Egerton, is an origin story for the game. It is inspired by true events, and follows the story of Henk Rogers, the man that &quot;risked his life to outsmart the KGB and turn Tetris into a worldwide sensation&quot;. The upcoming film takes place in 1988 when Rogers first discovers Tetris and &quot;risks everything by travelling to the Soviet Union&quot;. Here, he teams up with Tetris&#x27; creator Alexey Pajitnov (played by The Thaw&#x27;s Nikita Efremov) &quot;to bring the game to the masses&quot;. 


If you had told me this was actually going to be a thing a few days ago I would have scoffed, however having seen the trailer for it I have to say, it looks kind of great (also, I am a sucker Europe&#x27;s &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, which features heavily in the trailer). You can see what you think about it for yourself via the video below.

Flights made by a private jet owned by Sony have been used to back up suggestion of a meeting between Sony executives and Microsoft in early February. 


Publicly available flight information shows a Sony jet flying from London to Seattle, where Microsoft is headquartered, around a month ago, for the first such visit in over 18 months, before travelling on to LA.

                              <span>Sherlock Holmes The Awakened, from Ukrainian studio Frogwares, has been delayed due to the ongoing war in the country.


Originally aiming for a late February or early March release date, the studio is now targeting a release of late March / early April.


While development of the game has been particularly challenging since April 2022, it&#x27;s been especially difficult during the winter. The studio released a video update in December depicting life in Ukraine during the ongoing war.

                              <span>Nintendo 3DS and Wii U owners have just over a year to transfer any remaining funds from their eShop wallets into their Nintendo Account, the company has now confirmed. 


As a reminder, the 3DS and Wii U eShops will effectively shut down from 27th March, leaving you unable to spend any remaining balance you might still  have. 


However, this balance will be transferrable to your Nintendo Account for use on Switch - up until March 2024 (as spotted by Nintendo Life).

                              <span>A new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet software update, known as version 1.2.0, will be released later this month.

As previously announced, this update is due to arrive towards the &quot;end of February&quot;, although there is no firm date as yet. It is set to add &quot;features to Pokémon Boxes&quot; and address a variety of bugs that &quot;affect game progress&quot; in both Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, among other things.


These include fixes for those rogue Poké Balls that were sometimes displayed in certain locations of the field unintentionally and an issue that meant the main character&#x27;s expressions did not change until a user&#x27;s game was closed and then reopened.

During the meeting Ybarra was asked several pre-screened questions on its supposed use of stack ranking for employee performance, the slashing of profit-share bonuses for 2022, and the announcement employees will be required to return to office working.


However, Blizzard employees soon took to social media after the meeting to express their outrage at Ybarra&#x27;s comments.

                              <span>A group of games industry veterans - consisting most prominently of former Respawn Entertainment developers with credits on the likes of Titanfall and Apex Legends - have teamed up to form new &quot;remote first&quot; studio Wildlight Entertainment.


Wildlight has been founded by Dusty Welch and Jason McCord (who&#x27;ll act as CEO and design director respectively), with Chad Grenier serving as studio head and game director. Grenier was previously game director on Respawn&#x27;s hugely popular battle royale shooter Apex Legends before leaving the studio after more than a decade at the end of last year.


Grenier is joined by another high-profile former Respawn team member, Mohammad Alavi, who&#x27;s design credits include Infinity Ward&#x27;s original Modern Warfare series and Titanfall. Prior to his departure from Respawn in 2021, Alavi was working on an unnamed &quot;single-player adventure&quot; - a reportedly now-canned project set in the Titanfall/Apex Legends universe.

                              <span>In the run-up to next week&#x27;s launch of Yakuza samurai spin-off Like a Dragon: Ishin, Sega has released a two-part combat demo for Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam.


Like a Dragon: Ishin, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, originally released for PlayStation 3 and PS4 in Japan (under the name Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!) back in 2014, transplanting the chaotic open-world Yakuza formula to the Late Edo Period for a historical slice of samurai action.


That action follows protagonist Sakamoto Ryōma as he returns to his home in Tosa where, after a run-in with a high-ranking samurai, he&#x27;s sentenced to be executed. Thankfully for both Ryōma and the game&#x27;s run-time, that particular crisis is averted, and our lead embarks on a quest through 1860s Kyo that blends story, action, and mini-games in much the same vein as Yakuza.

And ahead of that, publisher 2K has launched another free trial across all platforms, plus discounts on the base game.


Venom will be the second DLC character to join Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns&#x27; original playable superhero line-up - consisting of Blade, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Hulk, Iron Man, Magik, Nico Minoru, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, and Wolverine - following on from the addition of Deadpool last month.


Venom&#x27;s DLC release, titled Redemption, includes three new story missions continuing on from those seen in Deadpool&#x27;s DLC, new skins and outfits, plus a new Research project known as Whisper Web, said to expand the tactical options for the Intel resource. Redemption will be available to purchase separately or as part of the Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns Season Pass, included in the Legendary Edition. Two more DLC characters - Morbius and Storm - are still to come.

                              <span>Bungie&#x27;s eye-catching new Destiny 2 cinematic arrived this week to cap off the game&#x27;s current Season 19 in style. 


Perhaps more excitingly, the trailer successfully hypes up both the impending arrival of Destiny 2&#x27;s Lightfall expansion at the end of the month, as well as the fact Bungie is finally bringing its overarcing 10-year narrative to a long-awaited finale.


I&#x27;ve previously put hundreds and hundreds of hours into the original Destiny and its sequel, but in recent years just kept up with its story, unable to devote the time required to keep up with the game itself each week. Even for someone like me, this new video has plenty to get excited about.

                              <span>The Legend of Dragoon is on its way to PlayStation Plus, marking the first time the JRPG has been available digitally in Europe.


First released in Japan in 1999 for the PlayStation 1, The Legend of Dragoon was later released in North America (2000) and Europe (2001), followed by a release as a PlayStation Classic on the PlayStation Network for PS3 and PSP in Japan and America - but not Europe.


As a result, the game has taken on cult classic status and is hard to come by, with original physical copies of the game available on eBay for upwards of £150 - £200.

This should include encouragement to take regular breaks from extended play &quot;without feeling pressurised to continue playing or becoming fearful of missing out&quot;, the ICO continued. 


While the report only offers recommendations, they are being made as part of the UK&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Code, which explains how the UK&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation (the dreaded GDPR) should be applied to digital services.

The news comes from the latest financial report from the publisher, which boasts a 128 percent increase in net sales across the company.


Little is known about these five Lord of the Rings games, although the report notes that the acquisition of Middle-Earth Enterprises has &quot;generated a lot of interest among both internal and external partners for the Lord of the Rings IP, across different media formats&quot;.

You now have the chance to play the game for three hours, which will give you a little taster of what&#x27;s in store for Kratos and Atreus as they negotiate the perils of the nine mythological Norse realms.



This trial made its debut in North America earlier this week, but it is now available for those of us in Europe as well.

Apex Legends&#x27; previous peak concurrent player count on Steam was in August 2022, when just over 500,000 players were online for Season 14, Hunted.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley gets its next major update today, which adds Olaf from Frozen, Mirabel from Encanto, and also extends the game&#x27;s ongoing storyline. 


Patch notes for the update released today also reveal the addition of a premium shop, which will see &quot;rotating cosmetic items like clothing, furniture, premium house skins and more&quot;. 


You won&#x27;t find this stuff elsewhere, such as at Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s General Store, and you&#x27;ll only be able to buy these things using the Moonstone currency - previously used to unlock the premium season pass reward track.

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s new &quot;carbon aware&quot; energy saving feature - which launched for Insider testing last month - is now available to everyone as part of the console&#x27;s February update.


Essentially, Xbox&#x27;s new energy saving feature allows a console - provided it&#x27;s connected to the internet and has access to regional carbon intensity data - to schedule game, app, and OS updates at time a higher proportion of electricity is coming from lower-carbon sources on the electric grid. Microsoft says this decreases fossil fuel dependency and CO2 emissions and could potentially saves users money. 


Additionally, Microsoft once again highlights Xbox&#x27;s Shutdown (energy saving) mode in its February update blog post, claiming it cuts power use by up to 20x compared to the Sleep power option. Shutdown mode was enabled automatically during recent Insider testing, but it&#x27;s not clear whether this is the case for general release.

                              <span>Valentine&#x27;s Day has been and gone but Warframe is still in a romantic mood, charting a love affair across the Void in its new Citrine&#x27;s Last Wish update, out today on all platforms.


Among the various additions introduced in Citrine&#x27;s Last Wish are new Mirror Defence missions, described as &quot;classic defence missions with a twist&quot;. This latest challenge type, found at the new Tyana Pass node, sees Tenno battling an onslaught of tough enemies determined to harness the power of two crystal-encased lovers, lost to time and space, for themselves. 


&quot;In response to the connection between Belric and Rania,&quot; explains developer Digital Extremes, &quot;The Void has bored a hole in space to connect their preserved bodies for eternity.&quot; As such, players will need to fend off Grineer and Corpus as they defend Rania&#x27;s crystal on Mars and Belric&#x27;s crystal on Venus in order to reunite the pair.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re not a PlayStation Plus subscribers but have always been faintly curious about what life might be like for those on the other side, now&#x27;s your chance to get some answers courtesy of Sony&#x27;s imminent free PlayStation Plus online multiplayer weekend.


Sony&#x27;s promotion runs for 24 hours, starting this Saturday 18th February, and as with its previous similar events, anyone can put PlayStation 4 and 5&#x27;s online multiplayer through its paces during that time - teaming up with friends, strangers, or otherwise across all multiplayer-supporting games - without needing to cough up the usual fee.


What you will need, though, is a registered PSN account - oh, and you won&#x27;t get very far without an active internet connection and a game that supports online play.

According to internal Slack messages that were leaked to Insider, an Amazon lawyer told workers that they had “already seen instances” of text generated by ChatGPT that “closely” resembled internal company data.
This issue seems to have come to a head recently because Amazon staffers and other tech workers throughout the industry have begun using ChatGPT as a “coding assistant” of sorts to help them write or improve strings of code, the report notes.
[…]
“This is important because your inputs may be used as training data for a further iteration of ChatGPT,” the lawyer wrote in the Slack messages viewed by Insider, “and we wouldn’t want its output to include or resemble our confidential information.”...</span>

                              <span>Wild Hearts developer Omega Force has pledged to address performance issues reported by players taking advantage of EA&#x27;s 10-hour early access offer ahead of this Friday&#x27;s release.


Wild Hearts is, of course, Omega Force and publisher EA&#x27;s spin on Monster Hunter, setting players loose in the land of Azuma, a kind of fantastical feudal Japan, to bring down mighty Kemono - behemoths fused with nature. EA Play subscribers on all platforms have been able to access the game&#x27;s first ten hours since yesterday, but early reports have pointed to disappointing performance and visual concerns, especially on PC.


PC players have reported the likes of lower-than-anticipated performance even on hardware well above EA&#x27;s recommended specs, as well persistent stutter regardless of settings and resolution. I&#x27;ve been playing the Origin version with an RTX 3070 for review, and have experienced both issues first-hand.

                              <span>With the launch of Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare 2 Season 2 today, Activision has teased what&#x27;s coming next in both a mid-season update and in the next season.


First off, Season 2 Reloaded adds a brand new core 6v6 multiplayer map for Modern Warfare 2. We know nothing about it, but we do have the image below to whet our appetites:


The addition of a brand new 6v6 map to Modern Warfare 2 will be welcomed by fans who feel the game has suffered from a lack of content in comparison to Call of Duty&#x27;s extraction mode DMZ and battle royale Warzone 2.0. Indeed, Modern Warfare 2 players reacted negatively when Activision revealed Season 2 includes two &quot;new&quot; maps: Dome and Valderas Museum. Dome is a remake of Dome from Infinity Ward&#x27;s 2011 game Modern Warfare 3, and Valderas Museum was playable in the MW2 beta before failing to make the launch for some reason.

                              <span>If you are in the US and fancy going against the grain for your Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom pre-ordering, GameStop is giving away a free wooden plaque if you shop with them.


Admittedly, this in itself isn&#x27;t really all that interesting. If you, like me, live in the UK then this deal is out of reach (for now at least, I will keep an eye out for it appearing at any local retailers). However, being the Zelda fan that I am, I have been taking a closer look at the plaque to see if it gives us any more clues about Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s story. 


On further investigation, I noticed the artwork depicted on the plaque is the same that can be seen adorning the Tears of the Kingdom artbook that comes with the game&#x27;s collectors edition, and can also be found on the game&#x27;s Japanese website. So, it is clearly important.

                              <span>Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, the latest spin-off from developer Riot Games&#x27; Riot Forge label, has been officially revealed following its leak last month, with a release now pencilled in for &quot;spring&quot; 2023 on PC and unspecified consoles.


Mageseeker will be the third release in Riot Forge&#x27;s A League of Legends Story spin-off series - arriving after Airship Syndicate&#x27;s acclaimed RPG Ruined King and BIT.TRIP creator Choice Provisions&#x27; puzzler Hextech Mayhem - and it&#x27;s something entirely different again, this time moving into the realm of gritty &quot;2D hi-bit pixel action-RPG&quot;.


Set in Demacia - a mighty kingdom that seeks to curtail what it considers to be forbidden magic - Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story casts players as Sylas, an escaped mage &quot;whose quest for vengeance will shatter Demacia&#x27;s deceptive peace&quot;. It&#x27;s described as an &quot;action-packed fantasy gameplay experience&quot; framed by a story of &quot;power, identity, and justice&quot;.

The project was first announced last November as an NFT project to mark a &quot;new franchise&quot;. At the start of this year, the company once again stated its intention to release blockchain games.




Now we know what Symbiogenesis will be: an &quot;interactive Web3 digital collectible art experience&quot; on the Polygon blockchain.

The financial scheme, founded by the country&#x27;s highly-controversial ruling Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now owns 7.08 percent of Nintendo, up from 6.07 percent in January, Trading View revealed today (thanks, VGC). 


The PIF was previously known to have acquired a 5.01 percent stake in the company as of May 2021. The quick addition of more highlights the fund&#x27;s growing stake in Nintendo - and many other video game companies -  gathering pace.

Admittedly, Rhianna did come close with her recent Super Bowl staging, but the distinct lack of Nintendo IP was a little disappointing.


Well, today I learned Nintendo actually did host its own real-life Smash Bros. event, sort of. There were no cosmic powers and elaborate stages, but even so, they still got Mario to wrestle Pikachu, Donkey Kong and Yoshi.


Back in 1999, Nintendo hosted Slamfest &#x27;99 in the MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park in Las Vegas to promote the upcoming Smash Bros. release for N64. The company hired actors to dress up as key characters from Nintendo history, and let them loose in a wrestling ring. Yes, actually.

The next-gen update for The Witcher 3 accidentally included realistic genitals for female monsters, which were not part of the original game.



Since stating it is &quot;working to address&quot; the inclusion after incorporating various fan mods into the update, CD Projekt Red has identified the source of the textures.

                              <span>Microsoft has listed another set of titles due to leave Xbox Game Pass in the near future - and there are several high profile departures.


The excellent survival horror Alien Isolation and the top-rated Dragon Ball FighterZ are among the crop set to depart on 28th February. 


Square Enix role-players Final Fantasy 13: Lightning Returns and Octopath Traveler are also getting the chop.

                              <span>XDefiant, the one-time Tom Clancy branded free-to-play shooter from Ubisoft, is holding another closed Insider test later this week, this one marking the first time cross-platform play will be available on consoles and PC.


XDefiant - previously described as a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division - was initially announced as Tom Clancy&#x27;s XDefiant back in 2021. However, Ubisoft ultimately chose to drop the Tom Clancy branding after fans criticised the game - and its sassy specialists - for straying too far from the franchise&#x27;s more serious military themes and formula.


Since then, Ubisoft has quietly continued XDefiant&#x27;s development, occasionally opening the game up to registered &quot;insiders&quot; as it seeks to garner feedback from players. Its latest closed Insider session runs from Thursday 16th February to Sunday 19th February (Monday 20th in the UK), and is the first to enable cross-play between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

                              <span>Minecraft developer Mojang is gearing up for this year&#x27;s big 1.20 release, and following on from last week&#x27;s revelation it&#x27;ll finally introduce the game&#x27;s long-delayed archaeology system, the studio has now confirmed it&#x27;ll also usher in a new cherry blossom biome and sniffer mob.


The sniffer, you might recall, came out top among Minecraft players during last year&#x27;s Minecraft Live mob vote, beating out two other options: the Rascal and Tuff Golem. Once 1.20 arrives, players will want to use their new archaeology tools to explore suspicious sand in search of sniffer eggs. Hatching these will eventually produce a fully grown sniffer, able to sniff out seeds long thought lost to time, but that when planted, will grow into unique blooms.


And talk of blooms brings us nicely to Minecraft 1.20&#x27;s other freshly announced addition: the aforementioned cherry blossom biome. As detailed in Mojang&#x27;s blog, the large, fluffy trees that grow here attract the likes of pigs, sheep, and bees, causing them to spawn in the area.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re yearning for sunnier climes as the winter drags on, Ubisoft might just have the answer, offering digital tourists on PC and consoles a limited-time trip to the fictional Caribbean island of Yara as part of its Far Cry 6 free trial this weekend.


From this Thursday 16th February to Monday 20th February, players on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC can slap on the sun cream, step into the boots of Far Cry 6 protagonist Dani Rojas, and embark on an gun-toting open-world adventure to help overthrow Yara&#x27;s charismatic dictator Antón Castillo.


You&#x27;ll get access to a big old chunk of Far Cry 6 over the duration of the event - including the base game, and its crossover missions inspired by Rambo: All the Blood and Stranger Things - and Ubisoft is enabling co-op for anyone wanting to team up with pals. Additionally, players that participate in co-op will receive the in-game White Lotus Sniper Rifle.

For decades, I have been waiting for the “big enough” incident that would finally do it. In 2015, Chinese military hackers hacked the Office of Personal Management and made off with the highly personal information of about 22 million Americans who had security clearances.

In 2017, hackers—years later we learned that it was the Chinese military—hacked the credit bureau Equifax and stole the personal information of 147 million Americans. In recent years, ransomware attacks have knocked hospitals offline, and many articles have been written about Russia inside the U.S. power grid.

                              <span>The Game Boy Advance SP was forward-thinking in a lot of ways. It featured a frontlit (later changed to be backlit) screen that has since become standard, and a highly portable clamshell design that paved the way for Nintendo DS. But its marketing here in the UK now looks more than a little more dated. 


Originally released in Japan 20 years ago today, and then here in Europe on 28th March, there&#x27;s no doubting the SP was a sleekly-designed piece of kit. The original Game Boy Advance was compact enough, but could also never escape looking like a toy - something a kid might try and conjure a Digimon out of in a particularly energetic play session. 


The SP, on the other hand, was intended to appear a more grown-up device and was therefore marketed as such. Its colours were more muted - its all-silver option made its hinged design look like a small laptop. Its angular shape was more business-like (and its dinky shoulder buttons rather less ergonomic to hold down). But all of this made sense - right? Nintendo already had a successful Game Boy Advance for the younger market. This one was for a different and more narrowly-targeted demographic - something its advertising also reflected.

                              <span>PlayStation 5 console sales were up 202 percent across Europe in January 2023, compared to the same month a year ago.


The statistic, per GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s Chris Dring, lays bare how well Sony&#x27;s hardware shipments have recovered - or, depending on how you look at it, how constrained they were back in 2022. 


In real terms, all of this means that getting hold of a PlayStation 5 should now be much easier, which is good news all round. Stock of the in-demand console has been limited since its launch in late 2020, and a target for greedy scalpers.

Yesterday, GamesIndustry.biz highlighted a line from the UK Competition and Markets Authority&#x27;s provisional report on Microsoft&#x27;s attempted Activision Blizzard takeover, published last week, in which Microsoft stated that a title&#x27;s inclusion in Game Pass resulted in a subsequent decline in base game sales.


&quot;Microsoft... submitted that its internal analysis shows a [redacted] percent decline in base game sales 12 months following their addition on Game Pass,&quot; the CMA stated.

                              <span>Sony has confirmed that, as we all suspected, Cosmic Smash is being revived for PlayStation VR2.


Just for a quick bit of background, Cosmic Smash initially launched all the way back in 2001. On its release, the game tasked players with traversing a futuristic subway-style map, with each &#x27;stop&#x27; on the line challenging them to clear blocks at the end of a long room within a certain amount of time. This was all done by using a ball and racquet, offering players an experience somewhere between Breakout and squash.


Now, 22 years later, the game is being brought back and reimagined for the PSVR2. This upcoming release is known as C-Smash VRS (the VRS stands for &quot;VR&quot; and &quot;versus&quot;) and is being developed by RapidEyeMovers along with VR veterans Wolf &amp; Wood (which is known for VR games such as The Exorcist: Legion VR and Hotel R&#x27;n&#x27;R). You can see a brief trailer for C-Smash VRS below.

                              <span>Mass Effect&#x27;s Legendary Edition is a brilliant remaster of BioWare&#x27;s sci-fi original trilogy, perfect in almost every way. 


But for hardcore fans, a few niggles remain. There&#x27;s the unfortunate loss of Mass Effect 1&#x27;s Pinnacle Station DLC - sadly gone forever, as its original development code became corrupted - and also the lack of Mass Effect 2&#x27;s Cerberus Daily News. 


For the uninitiated, Cerberus Daily News snippets originally appeared on Mass Effect 2&#x27;s main menu screen as short in-universe news reports, fleshing out the game&#x27;s wider galaxy with ongoing stories and further detail.

                              <span>Dead Island 2&#x27;s release date has been quite the saga.


Today, Dambuster Studios revealed Dead Island 2 will now make its zombie-riddled debut a week earlier than  previously announced. 


Yes, make a new note in your diary, as its release date has changed again. We are now expecting the game to launch on 21st April.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red is &quot;working to address&quot; the accidental inclusion of realistic vaginas in the updated The Witcher 3.


The recently released next-gen patch for the game includes realistic genitals for female monsters, which was not part of the original game, reported Kotaku.



CD Projekt Red has since confirmed to Eurogamer the accidental inclusion stems from the use of mods from the community.

The in-universe advert for Mario and Luigi&#x27;s plumbing buisiness popped up last night during the Super Bowl, and sees the brothers saving the day from a leaky sink.


An associated website for the business has also gone live at SMBPlumbing.com, and also includes a US phone number you can ring to hear a pre-recorded voice message from Luigi himself (Charlie Day).

Former Retro Studios engineer Zoid Kirsch, who was also unhappy about changes to the door designs, said on Twitter he was &quot;let down&quot; by the lack of individual credits.



&quot;While many studios did amazing work on the remaster, I&#x27;m let down Metroid Prime&#x27;s Remaster does not include the full original game credits,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Last week, I said that episode four of The Last of Us was clearly setting the stage for something bigger, and, oh boy, was I right. 


As with previous episodes, episode five (known as Endure and Survive) is brilliantly acted by all involved. The show continues to blur the line between good and bad: if you do bad things for a good reason, does that make you a bad person? Or does it all depend on whose lens you see a story through? 


This episode sees a definite pick up in action and momentum for Joel and Ellie&#x27;s story, and as always leaves plenty of things for us to pick apart and discuss. Let&#x27;s get into it.

&quot;We knew that we needed to get Immortal Empires to you in the best possible state, and that&#x27;s where we focused all of our efforts last year,&quot; Aldridge said at the start of their five-minute statement (thanks, PC Gamer).

The baseball series has hitherto only been available in Japan, but it&#x27;s getting a &quot;global debut&quot; and is now available for the introductory price of 79p – or $0.99 – with &quot;no additional charges&quot; (although &quot;some regions may be slightly higher than this price due to digital store minimum pricing restrictions&quot;).

Officially licensed by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), the game features over 300 characters to choose from, with whom players can &quot;assemble their team of batters, catchers, and pitchers to compete in online matches against rivals from all over the world&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto, who hinted that 2D fans can &quot;look forward&quot; to new side-scrolling games alongside the franchise&#x27;s more contemporary offerings, most of which have been 3D.

Asked on Twitter if Sega would consider releasing a Sonic 4-esque game, Kishimoto responded by confirming that Sonic 4 was made by Dimps, adding that &quot;in addition to 3D Sonic games&quot;, &quot;Sonic games also have side-scrolling Sonic games, so please look forward to them!&quot;

                              <span>Amazon Games&#x27; Lost Ark recently celebrated its first anniversary, and to mark the occasion, the studio has issued an infographic detailing how Heroes of Arkesia have been spending their time over the last 12 months.

&quot;From the first Mokoko Seed found to the first Legion Raid clear to DatModz’s Brelshaza cosplay and everything in between, there have been an immeasurable number of adventures in Lost Ark and throughout the Lost Ark community,&quot; the team said. &quot;While we can’t quantify every journey that’s occurred this year, here’s a few fun ones from Lost Ark’s first year in the West!&quot;

With almost seven million hours broadcast on Twitch - and 313,296,910 hours watched on the streaming platform - it looks like players died to Guardians far more than the other way around, with 1,672,050,487 player deaths against 99,281,741 dead Guardians.

                              <span>A new behind-the-scenes video reveals how HBO pulled together The Last of Us&#x27; fifth episode, including how it brought the game&#x27;s terrifying Bloaters to life in the show.

Created by four-time Emmy-winner prosthetics designer Barrie Gower – who also created some of the most memorable creatures in shows like Stranger Things and Game of Thrones – the Bloater suit weights an astonishing 40 kilos (88 pounds) and was worn by the 6&#x27;6&quot; British stuntperson, Adam Basil.

&quot;The suit would be very soft, but very slimy and wet,&quot; Gower told Variety. &quot;We covered him in this gel-like solution, which gave him a gloss to all the fungus. We had lots of little spines and spiky hairs punched into his body, like little growths burrowing out.

                              <span>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has just broken its all-time concurrent PC user peak… 11 years after it launched on Steam.

As spotted by PC Gamer, the shooter - which has been around in one form or another for over 20 years at this point - recently surpassed its own concurrent record, hitting an all-time peak of 1.3 million players over the weekend.

Prior to this weekend, CS:GO&#x27;s concurrent user record reportedly stood at 1,308,963 players. But that record was set three years ago, and as you may remember, there was something happening at that time that unexpectedly kept us all indoors. That makes this week&#x27;s 1,320,219 record particularly impressive.

The limited-edition collection – set to launch on 16th February – will be available worldwide and includes two classic clogs, two classic elevated clogs that come with Jibbitz charms, a classic slide, and two &quot;unique sets of Minecraft-themed Jibbitz charms that will &quot;turn any pair of Crocs into a Minecraft adventure&quot;.

Both sets of clogs will be available for adults and kids, although the classic slide will only be available for grown-ups - sorry.

The documentary - which is available to stream right now, for free, on Youtube – follows the studio&#x27;s trials and tribulations as it develops Psychonauts 2, confronting &quot;overly ambitious designs, poor morale, technical challenges, and financial woes&quot;.

Across 32 episodes – and a staggering 20+ hours – the documentary continues the work of previous documentary series Double Fine Adventure, offering an &quot;even deeper insight into the passion, humour, and heartbreak of video game development&quot;.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has revealed that he would &quot;absolutely remain&quot; at the megacorp if the planned acquisition with Microsoft does not proceed.

Originally, it was thought that Kotick would stand down once the deal is finalised, but Fox Business reports that undisclosed sources &quot;close to the situation&quot; say that if Microsoft&#x27;s planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard stalls, current CEO Kotick &quot;will absolutely remain at the gaming giant to run the company&quot;.

The same sources reports that the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is &quot;the only regulatory body that really matters&quot; given &quot;it offers companies no legal recourse such as a trial&quot;, but &quot;confidence remains high&quot; that the merger will proceed as planned.

                              <span>It looks like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be the largest first-party Nintendo game ever to come to Switch.

That&#x27;s according to Redditor bob4978135, who was one of the first to clock that the Japanese version of the game weighs in at 18.2GB.

The US Nintendo eShop makes a similar size claim, whilst the UK Nintendo eShop says you&#x27;ll need a whopping 18.6GB free to download the highly-anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>Hi-Fi Rush is unquestionably fab, but developer Tango Gameworks&#x27; rhythm-action treat might just be a little bit fabber than we all initially thought if a newly made discovery turns out to be the cheeky tease for a new The Evil Within game some are interpreting it to be.


As noted by GamesRadar,  Hi-Fi Rush features one particular cinematic - situated just before Track 11: The Needle Drop - in which a news ticker can be spotted on a screen as protagonist Chai and his crew ride an elevator up to the game&#x27;s final boss.


It&#x27;s a brief, blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it moment, but as the camera cuts to a close-up of the screen, the words &quot;Sequel to popular survival horror franchise announced&quot; scroll into view.

                              <span>Nearly two years after its initial delay, Minecraft&#x27;s long-awaited archeology feature is finally on the horizon, with developer Mojang now confirming it&#x27;ll be arriving as part of the game&#x27;s 1.20 update later this year.


Archeology was originally announced during 2020&#x27;s Minecraft Live, and was planned to release as part of the game&#x27;s expansive Caves &amp; Cliffs update the following summer. However, as its launch date neared, Mojang - as it grappled with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic - announced it had made the decision to split Caves &amp; Cliffs&#x27; feature list into two, with a second release due before the end of the year. Archeology, though, had been decoupled from even that and would arrive at an unspecified future point.


Skip ahead almost two years and we&#x27;re back to today, and the announcement that archeology will finally debut with Minecraft&#x27;s next major update.

                              <span>It only feels like yesterday we were all praying to the gods of impossible things that we might one day get a sequel to cult monologue-&#x27;em-up Alan Wake, but now, not only has one been announced, developer Remedy Entertainment has confirmed the game&#x27;s reached a stage in development where it&#x27;s &quot;playable from start to finish&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to Remedy CEO Tero Virtala, who shared the news as part of the company&#x27;s latest financial results report. &quot;Alan Wake 2 is in full production,&quot; he wrote in his statement to investors. &quot;The game will soon have all content in place, and it is playable from start to finish.&quot;


That probably shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a surprise, of course, given the studio had previously confirmed a 2023 release for its long-awaited sequel, but it&#x27;s a milestone worth noting for Alan Wake fans, and Virtala adds Remedy will next &quot;move onto polishing the experience.&quot;

Yoko is best known as the creator of the Drakengard and Nier series, and it looks like he&#x27;ll be bringing some of his RPG expertise and trademark, er, style to the game.

The game&#x27;s full title is 404 Game Re:set -Error Game Reset- and is an RPG for mobiles.

                              <span>Valve has set tongues wagging in the Team Fortress 2 community by announcing what sounds like a meaningful update due out this summer.


In a post on the previously dormant Team Fortress website, Valve promised a &quot;full-on update-sized update&quot;, while calling for content from Steam Workshop creators.

&quot;The last few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates,&quot; Valve said. &quot;But this year, we&#x27;re planning on shipping a full-on update-sized update - with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints and who knows what else?! Which means we need Steam Workshop content! YOUR Steam Workshop content!&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has ruled out a Switch price cut for now despite flagging sales of the console.


In an official Q&amp;A summary posted in English, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa addressed a question about the company&#x27;s pricing strategy for the Switch, which has so far resisted a price cut since its launch in March 2017.

&quot;As we continue the Nintendo Switch business over the long term, we have tried to preserve the value and prices of both hardware and software as much as possible,&quot; reads Furukawa&#x27;s response. &quot;We do not believe that policy needs to be changed at this point.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft is having some serious issues with The Division 2 at the moment.


Last week, Ubisoft announced it had delayed the planned 7th February launch of Season 11: Reign of Fire due to a localisation issue.


Then, in a tweet published yesterday, Ubisoft admitted that in creating a fix for this problem, it caused an error that brought down the game&#x27;s build generation. This means the development team cannot update the game at all until the system is rebuilt.

                              <span>Square Enix has suspended Final Fantasy 14 housing demolition following the devastating Turkey-Syria earthquake.


More than 21,000 people are now known to have died after Monday&#x27;s earthquakes in southern Turkey and northern Syria.


In response, Square Enix announced it had temporarily suspended automatic housing demolition on the game&#x27;s European realms. This means all Chaos and Light worlds have paused demolition timers.

                              <span>Sony has accused Microsoft of &quot;obvious harassment&quot; as the battle for Activision Blizzard heated up this week.


As reported by Axios Axios, Microsoft wanted to see files on Sony executives, including performance reviews, as part of the &quot;discovery&quot; phase of this particularly bitter legal battle with the US&#x27; Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn buyout of Activision Blizzard.


In a motion filed to the court, Sony issued strong words in response: &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s demand for performance reviews for SIE&#x27;s leadership is obvious harassment.&quot;

                              <span>Volker Wertich, the designer of the original The Settlers, has unveiled new city builder Pioneers of Pagonia, which is coming to PC early access toward the end of this year.


Pioneers of Pagonia sets players loose on the titular islands of Pagonia, where their goal is to establish their presence through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover - and the alliances they forge with Pagonia&#x27;s not always friendly inhabitants - along the way.


&quot;With Pioneers of Pagonia,&quot; Wertich explained in a statement accompanying today&#x27;s announcement, &quot;we&#x27;re returning to the origins of city-building simulations, with thousands of inhabitants scurrying around and a focus on the in-depth simulation of the game world and economy that the community loves so much.&quot;

                              <span>As it likes to do on occassion, Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Blog has had a bit of a mini showcase, highlighting a number of promising indie games bound for its consoles in the future. This time around, PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, Eternights, Animal Well, and Pacific Drive got the highlight treatment and you can see what they&#x27;re offering below.


First up is PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, a wider release of developer Q-Games&#x27; previously Apple-Arcade-exclusive side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up. It sees up to four player taking to the streets of Junktown and using their robo-abilities to eliminate anyone that gets in their way. It promises 25 stages across five distinct areas, over 100 customisable truck parts, online and local co-op, competitive mini-games, and more when it launches for PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC later this year.


Next up is Animal Well, the first game from YouTuber videogamedunkey&#x27;s publishing company Bigmode. It&#x27;s a Metroidvania from solo developer Shared Memory and sees players exploring a surreal labyrinthine filled with animals and secrets. Shared Memory discusses their goals for the game on the PlayStation Blog, explaining how they&#x27;re creating a core experience that&#x27;s accessible for all, but with deeper layers of mystery for those that like to probe and explore. There&#x27;s no release date for Animal Well yet but it&#x27;s coming to PS5 and PC.

                              <span>As revealed during last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct - an announcement you might reasonably have missed if you don&#x27;t give two hoots about Nintendo - Dead Cells&#x27; Return to Castlevania DLC finally has a release date and is coming to PC and consoles on 6th March.


Return to Castlevania, if you&#x27;ve missed previous word on the deliciously fitting crossover, is a new paid expansion that developer Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire have described as &quot;our very own love letter to the granddad of Dead Cells&quot;.


It adds two new Castlevania-inspired biomes to the superb rogue-like action-platformer, taking players - who&#x27;ll get some assistance from the likes of Richter Belmont and Alucardon - on a tour of the spooky outskirts and candle-lit interior of Dracula&#x27;s Castle.

                              <span>Fans of Paradox Interactive grand strategy title Europa Universalis 4 have questioned the timing of a developer diary detailing new additions on the way for Russia, highlighting its imperial expansion into eastern Europe. 


While part of a series of updates adding to the game&#x27;s various empires, the game&#x27;s latest developer update, published this week, describes the changes to Russia in detail. Its timing raised eyebrows, coming two weeks before the anniversary of Russia&#x27;s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and amid reports suggesting the country is currently preparing a new offensive.


&quot;It&#x27;s a historical game,&quot; a fan told Eurogamer, &quot;but the fantasy missions they plan on releasing are more in line [with] the Soviet dream of conquering all Slavic nations... I find it completely distasteful they&#x27;re working on this at such a time.&quot;

                              <span>The tax code isn’t software. It doesn’t run on a computer. But it’s still code. It’s a series of algorithms that takes an input—financial information for the year—and produces an output: the amount of tax owed. It’s incredibly complex code; there are a bazillion details and exceptions and special cases. It consists of government laws, rulings from the tax authorities, judicial decisions, and legal opinions.
Like computer code, the tax code has bugs. They might be mistakes in how the tax laws were written. They might be mistakes in how the tax code is interpreted, oversights in how parts of the law were conceived, or unintended omissions of some sort or another.

                              <span>Comedy management game Two Point Campus will be available on Steam for free ahead of Valentine&#x27;s Day.


That&#x27;s beginning right now until 13th February, along with a host of new love items available permanently and even love bombs.


Yes, if your campus is suitably decorated, Cupid will visit and - if impressed - will drop some Love Bombs on students to whip them up into a romantic frenzy. I presume they&#x27;ll be heading straight to the nearest love trumpet.

                              <span>There&#x27;s one game which we missed in our roundup of everything shown in last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct.

That&#x27;s because, for some reason, it was only shown in the Japanese version of the stream, despite being a worldwide release.
The game had a short 40-second teaser in the Direct, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Hello and welcome to the Eurogamer Newscast, which this week looks ahead to everything on the horizon for Nintendo Switch - and Nintendo itself.

Of course, we recap last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and discuss what we thought about Pikmin getting a dog and whether Zelda really will be playable in Tears of the Kingdom. But with the knowledge that Nintendo itself admits Switch is now firmly on the decline, the company skipping E3 this year and rumours of new hardware in 2024, we also discuss where Switch is now headed.
For fans of Nintendo, there&#x27;s plenty still to enjoy - even if it is now slanted to nostalgia, such as with Game Boy games, Metroid ports and a Baten Kaitos remake. But where does this leave Nintendo later this year, and next? Joining me to discuss all that and more are Ed Nightingale and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Retro JRPG Sea of Stars finally has a release date of 29th August, across Switch, PC, and PlayStation.


The news was shared at last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct livestream, along with the immediate release of a demo - our first chance to go hands-on with the game.


Sea of Stars is from Sabotage Studio, who rose to prominence with the release of 2D side scroller The Messenger. Where that game was inspired by the Ninja Gaiden series, Sea of Stars is inspired by Chrono Trigger and other SNES JRPGs.

                              <span>So, that new trailer, eh? Of course Nintendo was going to leave it until the very end of last night&#x27;s Direct. 


And wow. We got small teases of the story plus a look at new enemies and powers. Plus, confirmation of the game&#x27;s retail price  and a snazzy collector&#x27;s edition.


Theories abound right now about what it all means, so let&#x27;s dive in and analyse the trailer to see what we can figure out!

                              <span>Metroid Prime Remastered was surprise released at last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, but there&#x27;s already a touch of controversy about... the doors.


The doors in the Metroid series have always been iconic, locked behind Samus&#x27;s various beam weapons, and Metroid Prime is no exception. It was the first time we got to see them from the front, so it was important to get the design right.


But in this remastered release, the design has been altered. And Zoid Kirsch, one of the original game&#x27;s developers, isn&#x27;t happy about it.

                              <span>Netflix has announced plans to begin charging you extra if you regularly share your account with users outside of your home.


Users outside your &quot;primary location&quot; will require an &quot;extra member sub account&quot;, starting now in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain, and elsewhere in the world &quot;more broadly in the coming months&quot;. 


Sub accounts will cost less than a standard subscription - though more than it currently costs to share your password with family and friends. In addition, the pricing seems to vary from country to country, at €4/month in Portugal but €6/month in Spain.

                              <span>Harmony: The Fall of Reverie was a surprise inclusion in last night&#x27;s Nintendo Direct from French developer Don&#x27;t Nod - the studio behind the original Life is Strange games, Remember Me and Tell Me Why. 


Due for launch in June for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, the title is notable for its colourful 2D visuals - something of a departure for Don&#x27;t Nod.


For fans of Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s choice-based storytelling, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie seems to offer something more familiar. Actions you take will open up new branching story paths, as the main character Polly engages in clairvoyance and interacts with a set of god-like spirits aligned with &quot;Aspirations of Humanity&quot; such as Glory, Power, Chaos and Bliss.

                              <span>Activision finally confirmed what Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 6v6 multiplayer fans can look forward to from Season 2.


The company said two &quot;new&quot; maps are set to hit the shooter as part of its second season: Dome and Valderas Museum.


However, fans have taken issue with Activision calling these maps new. Dome is a remake of a map that has featured in multiple Call of Duty games in the past, including 2021&#x27;s Vanguard. It made its debut in Call of Duty: World at War. Specifically, the version set to hit this Modern Warfare 2 is from Infinity Ward&#x27;s 2011 game Modern Warfare 3.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s hotly-anticipated February 2023 showcase is over, and we now have a much clearer idea of what&#x27;s coming to Switch during the first half of this year. Nintendo Direct crammed a huge amount into its 40-minute runtime, including some truly fantastic reveals. We got a portion of Zelda, a pinch of Pikmin 4, a bowlful of Bayonetta and more than a few surprises. Here are all the announcements, trailers and news Nintendo gave the gaming world. Strap yourself in, there&#x27;s A LOT.


Nintendo Direct kicked off with a trailer for Pikmin 4, which looks as lovely and cute as you&#x27;d hope. The big news is the release date: 21st July 2023!


Next up, a trailer for Volume 3 of the Xenoblade Chronices 3 expansion pass, which is out later this month, and a sneak peek of the new story scenario coming in Volume 4 later this year.

                              <span>Not content with giving Mario Kart 8 Deluxe players a heaving bunch of new tracks as part of its Booster Course Pass, Nintendo has announced it&#x27;ll be bringing the best video game character of all time, Birdo, back in the DLC&#x27;s upcoming Wave 4 as a playable racer.


Birdo, who&#x27;s actually quite modest in real-life and is generally content to just let that stupid plumber in the hat steal the limelight, changed the face of gaming when they were introduced in 1988&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. 2. 


Since then, Birdo has been personally responsible for developing all of Nintendo&#x27;s best games and finally found time to make their Mario Kart debut in 2003&#x27;s Double Dash!!. Birdo has been a Mario Kart staple ever since, but someone carelessly forgot to include them in Mario Kart 8 - probably Miyamoto, because he was too busy drawing pictures of Birdo - but that oversight will be remedied as of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4 DLC.

Tonight&#x27;s Nintendo Direct broadcast revealed a new 21st April arrival for the Nintendo Switch tactical strategy title.


Advance Wars was originally set to launch a year ago, but was held back from launch due to the proximity of its release and the very real Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Samba de Amigo: Party Central, as this new version will be known, takes the exuberant rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - where the aim is essentially to orientate your maraca-ing arms into position according to the game&#x27;s whims then rhythmically shake to the music like you&#x27;ve never shaken before - but slings in a bunch of new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


40 songs are promised, spanning a variety of genres, as are a bunch of cosmetics to customise your simian avatars. Additionally, Love Checker mode is back, testing your compatibility with a second player based on the accuracy of your limb-flailing, and there&#x27;s online multiplayer in World Party mode, where the goal is to keep the beat and avoid being eliminated.

                              <span>Tonight brought our first look at Pikmin 4 gameplay in a trailer shown as part of Nintendo Direct. 


The footage introduced us to the brand new Ice Pikmin variety, which can freeze enemies and surfaces, such as pools of water. The original Red, Blue and Yellow Pikmin types were also shown.


Tonight&#x27;s trailer also introduced us to an odd-looking dog creature which can be used to charge or carry Pikmin across obstacles such as water. It&#x27;s not a Pikmin but... it looks friendly.

                              <span>Forspoken director Takeshi Aramaki has confirmed a patch is currently in the works to address a wide range of issues following the game&#x27;s mixed reception.


In a statement shared on Twitter, Aramaki wrote, &quot;We&#x27;ve been listening to all your feedback and are hard at work on an upcoming patch that will include improvements to overall performance, graphics, playability, and general updates and fixes to the game content across PS5 and various PC hardware configurations&quot;.


Aramaki didn&#x27;t go into specifics, but Forspoken has been criticised both from a gameplay and technical perspective since launch, with Digital Foundry having particularly stern words for the PC release, calling it a &quot;confusing, deeply disappointing port&quot; in its tech review.

                              <span>This is a neat piece of historical research.
The team of computer scientist George Lasry, pianist Norbert Biermann and astrophysicist Satoshi Tomokiyo—all keen cryptographers—initially thought the batch of encoded documents related to Italy, because that was how they were filed at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.
However, they quickly realised the letters were in French. Many verb and adjectival forms being feminine, regular mention of captivity, and recurring names—such as Walsingham—all put them on the trail of Mary. Sir Francis Walsingham was Queen Elizabeth’s spymaster...</span>

                              <span>A Californian Nintendo fan has sparked a major security scare at their university, following a &quot;bad joke&quot; email designed to get  their classes cancelled so they could watch the latest Nintendo Direct broadcast.


California State University Police today issued a statement on the perceived threat, after a professor was told via anonymous email to call off their class due to a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime event&quot; set to occur.


The start of 2023 has seen yet another string of mass shootings across the US, with eight incidents in January alone leaving at least four people dead. The majority of those shootings occured in California, including the mass shooting at Monterey Park that left 12 dead, which gained global media attention.

Tonight&#x27;s the big one - or at least it really should be - in which the veil will be properly lifted from the next big Zelda and we finally learn more about Tears of the Kingdom. Or maybe we&#x27;re just going to get a 40 minute deep dive into Bayonetta Origins. Who knows? 


That&#x27;s part of the excitement of a Nintendo Direct, where we&#x27;re all hoping for news on Pikmin 4, the long-awaited ports of Metroid Prime and the belated release of Advance Wars and maybe even an F-Zero reboot thrown in for good measure. How much of that happens remains to be seen, so join us from 10pm GMT as we brace for disappointment.

The Battle Royale maps for Revelry are Broken Moon, Storm Point, and World&#x27;s Edge. Sadly, there&#x27;s no sign of Kings Canyon popping its head up in this mode any time soon. 
However, with new content comes sacrifice and the 3 vs 3 Arenas mode will be leaving the game as soon as the new season begins. There&#x27;s still some time left to get in a few quick battles before the launch date next week, so Arenas fans still have some time to say their farewells.

                              <span>Pokémon Go is currently gearing up for its third annual Tour event: a weekend-long spotlight on a particular region of the Pokémon world and all the species originally found within it. 


This year, after the turns of Johto and Kanto in 2021 and 2022, it&#x27;s time for Hoenn: the setting of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and the home of Mudkip, Metagross and many other favourites. 


The big difference this time around is that developer Niantic has dropped the need to buy a ticket for the majority of Tour&#x27;s gameplay. It means fans can take part in the weekend&#x27;s storyline, choose a focus on Ruby or Sapphire spawns, and catch Pokémon with a boosted chance of being in their sought-after Shiny versions without the need to pay up.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced February&#x27;s first line-up of Xbox Game Pass additions, including Cities: Skylines and Atomic Heart.


Before those, Madden NFL 23 joins Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, if you prefer your sports a little more padded out than simply watching the Six Nations.


SD Gundam Battle Alliance also arrives tomorrow, while Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord joins the subscription service on Valentine&#x27;s Day if you don&#x27;t have other plans. Last year, our Bertie dubbed it as &quot;stubborn and unruly unless you have time to break it in&quot;.

                              <span>The UK regulator investigating Microsoft&#x27;s attempted $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover attempt has raised significant concerns over the deal going ahead. 


In a provisional report published today, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that Microsoft owning Activision &quot;could harm UK gamers&quot; and potentially result in &quot;higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation&quot;.


While provisional, the findings paint a gloomy picture for Microsoft - against a similar backdrop of concerns raised by the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU&#x27;s European Commission, which have both contested the deal as it currently stands.

The zombie MMO was recently delayed from March until November, as Fntastic seemingly forgot to trademark the game name. The developer insisted the game was not a scam following the delay - its development has seen multiple delays and, until this point, a lack of real gameplay shown.




After that, a ten minute gameplay trailer was released. However, users on Twitter and reddit noticed some striking similarities between Fntastic&#x27;s game and Call of Duty.

 We&#x27;re still waiting to hear the price for Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s collector&#x27;s edition, which includes an artbook, Steelbook case, poster and pin badges. 
 
 Tonight, Nintendo also revealed a new amiibo figure of Link that grants access to materials and weapons, as well as a special fabric for Link&#x27;s paraglider. Tears of the Kingdom? Tears of my wallet, more like.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick has taken aim at post-Brexit Britain, as it looks increasingly likely the UK&#x27;s anti-competition regulator will try and block Microsoft&#x27;s ambitious $68.7bn buyout of the company. 


The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is due to weigh in imminently on the proposed deal, which has already seen objections from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and regulators in the EU.


Activision&#x27;s controversial CEO was asked by CNBC how he would react if the UK joined other regulators in opposing the deal - and Kotick did not hold back.

Resident Evil: Death Island will be a continuation of the animated saga, which has mostly followed the career of Leon Kennedy, and is distributed by Sony Pictures.


Judging by the brand new teaser trailer, there&#x27;s a zombie outbreak (shock!) on the island of Alcatraz that only Leon and Chris Redfield can deal with - check it out below.

Cities: Skylines Remastered, as the new version is known, promises a broad range of improvements over the existing console release, starting with increased graphical performance - which is as specific as publisher Paradox Interactive is being on that front right now.


Other improvements include the ability for players to build bigger cities thanks to a bump in the buildable tile limit, which rises from 9 in the current console release to 25.

                              <span>With two gothic platformers under its belt in Bloodstained: Curse Of The Moon and its sequel, you might think developer Inti Creates would have had its fill of moonlit spires, opulent interiors, and the like, but no! The studio has now unveiled Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, coming to Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 23rd February.


Grim Guardians: Demon Purge - described by Inti as a &quot;2D side-scrolling action game&quot; - certainly has the whiff of a Castlevania about it, ticking all the right aesthetic boxes as its demon-hunting sister protagonists brave a sprawling castle in an attempt to save their school.


Progress unfolds across distinct stages, with each sister having access to unique skills that players can utilise by switching between them. There are also bosses that reward new weapons on defeat - opening up new routes in later areas - plus two-player co-op for those that want to play with a friend. Additionally, Inti promises extensive difficulty options with the game&#x27;s Style System, and unique changes on repeat plays.

                              <span>Velan Studios, the developer behind Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit and the sadly soon-to-go-offline Knockout City, has unveiled Hot Wheels: Rift Rally, a new mixed reality racer that&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, PS4, and iOS on 14th March.


Like Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit before it, Hot Wheels: Rift Rally includes a bunch of physical components - in this case, a remote control car known as the Chameleon RC and four &quot;mixed reality gates&quot; used to lay out courses in the real-world - all of which are transformed into something a little more exotic when viewed on a screen.


The Chameleon RC, for instance, can take on the appearance of over 140 different vehicles, ranging from classic Hot Wheels cars (think Twin Mill, Bone Shaker, Gotta Go, and Mach Speeder) to a number of Rift Rally originals.

                              <span>Darkest Dungeon 2 - developer Red Hook Studios&#x27; deliciously bleak rogue-like RPG sequel - leaves early access on 8th May, arriving on Steam the same day.


Darkest Dungeon 2 launched into early access back in October 2021, but sidestepped a Steam release in favour of Epic Games Store exclusivity throughout its journey toward version 1.0. As Red Hook previously explained though, that exclusivity ends with Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s full release, meaning it&#x27;ll soon be creeping onto Valve&#x27;s platform.


And if you haven&#x27;t been following Darkest Dungeon 2&#x27;s last year and a half of development, you may be wondering what changes this sequel brings. Chief of these (other than its shift to full 3D) is a new structure described by Red Hook as a &quot;grim turn-based roadtrip&quot; across five regions.

                              <span>Microsoft has unveiled the Stellar Shift, the latest variant in its now three-strong series of metallic-hued Xbox wireless controllers - this one sporting a purple-blue frontage said to evoke &quot;a mesmerising feeling of deep space vibes&quot;.


Stellar Shift follows on from Microsoft&#x27;s Lunar Shift and Aqua Shift controllers (the latter being metallic blue with hints of purple, so definitely not the same thing), and features the same rubberised &quot;swirl&quot; grip and textured bumpers seen in previous editions of the device.


And, of course, it features the usual array of orifices (there&#x27;s a 3.5mm headset jack) and inputs seen across Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox controller range. Thumbsticks, D-pad, and face buttons, in case you&#x27;re wondering, all come in grey with purple label detail.

                              <span>In early 2021, IEEE Security and Privacy asked a number of board members for brief perspectives on the SolarWinds incident while it was still breaking news. This was my response.
The penetration of government and corporate networks worldwide is the result of inadequate cyberdefenses across the board. The lessons are many, but I want to focus on one important one we’ve learned: the software that’s managing our critical networks isn’t secure, and that’s because the market doesn’t reward that security.
SolarWinds is a perfect example. The company was the initial infection vector for much of the operation. Its trusted position inside so many critical networks made it a perfect target for a supply-chain attack, and its shoddy security practices made it an easy target...</span>

                              <span>The developer of a Final Fantasy 14 mod has been criticised for purposefully adding potentially harmful malware to the code that forces a computer shutdown.


All third-party tools are against the Terms of Service for the MMORPG - in fact, just last week director and producer Naoki Yoshida stated he was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; in the use of mods.



GShade, however, is a popular mod to alter the aesthetics of the game without affecting gameplay.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two is planning to settle its legal case with a group of talented fans who had reverse-engineered GTA3 and Vice City. 


Take-Two went after the fan projects in 2021, claiming copyright infringement. Twice, the publisher forced the projects to be removed via DMCA takedown, as the fans themselves protested that the projects were unprotected by copyright or permitted under fair use.


After a back and forth between Take-Two and the fans, lawyers got involved. Take-Two alleged the fans had distributed &quot;derivative GTA source code&quot; and had infringed copyright, and demanded GitHub remove the projects once and for all.

Players can look forward to dredging up some mystery on 30th March across PC, Switch, PlayStation and Xbox consoles.


A new release date trailer, below, shows the game&#x27;s sombre tone and hints at the sort of alien-like creatures players can expect to fish.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has reported healthy financial results following the launches of both Overwatch 2 and last year&#x27;s Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.


Blizzard&#x27;s monthly active users have seen a sharp uptick, up nearly 87 percent year-on-year, following a long trend downwards. Revenue for the three months ending 31st December rose by roughly the same amount, as people splashed their cash on the free-to-play sequel.


World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, the latest expansion to Blizzard&#x27;s long-running MMO, launched in late November. For the first time in 10 years, sales were down slightly on its predecessor, 2020&#x27;s Shadowlands (which shifted over 3.7m copies at launch).

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns was my favourite game from last year that never found an audience. Just today, it was listed among the list of titles recently released by publisher Take-Two that reviewed positively but - for whatever reason - failed to set tills ringing. 


Released in December, Midnight Suns offers a strong story-based single-player experience that alternates between easy-to-understand turn-based combat and an RPG-style hub where you hang out and befriend the superheroes you&#x27;ve recruited onto your team. The fights are fun and fast-paced. The story is well-written, and the interactions between Marvel characters frequently brilliant. There&#x27;s a lot to love.


I never felt the game&#x27;s marketing properly spelled all of that out - and as someone who has not played XCOM before, I was initially unsure about leaping into my first Firaxis game. Ultimately I took the plunge and came away very happily surprised.

From developer Ghost Story Games, the game was first shown at The Game Awards last December and looks to include many familiar features to BioShock fans. It&#x27;s set for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.



The release date news comes from Take-Two&#x27;s latest earnings report, which states the publisher will release 87 games between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2025 (ending March that year).

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two has confirmed a &quot;cost reduction program&quot; to cut $50m of annual spending after a string of high-profile launches failed to find an audience.


Speaking to investors, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said recent releases such as the excellent but overlooked Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, plus PGA Tour 2K23 and New Tales of the Borderlands, had all been received well but sold poorly.


&quot;We&#x27;re seeing softness in the overall market,&quot; Zelnick subsequently told GamesIndustry.biz. &quot;Our titles are performing, we&#x27;ve gotten great review scores, we&#x27;ve gotten terrific critical acclaim. And one after another, we&#x27;ve been delivering hits into the current market.

As reported by Variety, 7.5 million viewers in the US tuned in for the series&#x27; fourth episode on Sunday - that is an increase of 17 percent from the previous week, where 6.4 million viewers settled down with episode three. 
The Last of Us has consistently seen its same-day audience numbers grow every week since it made its debut in January. In fact, episode four&#x27;s numbers are up 60 percent from episode one&#x27;s same-day numbers, for which 4.7 million of us tuned in to the premiere.

                              <span>Nintendo has now shifted a staggering 122m Switch consoles, enough to finally exclipse the Game Boy (118m) and PlayStation 4 (117m). 


Six years on from launch, this total places Switch as the third-best selling game platform of all time, behind Nintendo DS (154m) and PlayStation 2 (above 155m).


Can Switch still rise further? Console sales are slowing - down 21 percent year-on-year - but it still seems possible, with sales of the Switch OLED model balancing out declining sales of the vanilla Switch and portable-only Lite.

The surge is coming from numerous malware families, including AuroraStealer, IcedID, Meta Stealer, RedLine Stealer, Vidar, Formbook, and XLoader. In the past, these families typically relied on phishing and malicious spam that attached Microsoft Word documents with booby-trapped macros. Over the past month, Google Ads has become the go-to place for criminals to spread their malicious wares that are disguised as legitimate downloads by impersonating brands such as Adobe Reader, Gimp, Microsoft Teams, OBS, Slack, Tor, and Thunderbird...</span>

Developer Bandai Namco&#x27;s confirmation Nina is part of Tekken 8&#x27;s roster comes as little surprise. She&#x27;s been a familiar face for the franchise since its origins, and has popped up in pretty much every major game since.


Nina joins other previously-announced Tekken 8 attendees such as  Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Paul Phoenix, Marshall Law, King, Jack-8, and Lars Alexandersson.

Now, she&#x27;s taking her musical Elden Ring pursuits to a whole new level by playing the game with a guitar. Is there no end to MissMikkaa&#x27;s talent?

                              <span>I was wandering around the USG Ishimura last night and found a creepy staff room, where a circle of candles were arranged in front of a TV screen showing the series&#x27; infamous red Marker. 


The room seemed ripe for a secret, so I began picking up the candles one by one with Stasis, throwing them to the floor - which also blew them out. Nothing happened. 


This morning, I&#x27;ve seen others had more luck than I did at unlocking a special secret here - and that Dead Space remake developer Motive has a wonderful Easter egg hidden away for those who take the time to puzzle it out.

                              <span>New details have emerged on the Retro Studios pitch Star Fox Armada for the Wii U, which was sadly never developed.


YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming spoke with former Retro Studios artist Eric Kozlowsky, who came up with the concept for the game.


Not only would the game have had a puppet visual style reminiscent of the series&#x27; early promotional images, it would have had a major focus on online multiplayer.

Firaxis&#x27; excellent tactical role-playing game ultimately featured 12 of the biggest Avengers and Midnight Suns faces in its final version - with plans to add four more characters post-launch. 


However, trimming down that final roster to something more manageable involved discussing several famous Marvel characters and whether they were suitable.

In an interview with VG247, Kitase - who&#x27;s producer on the Remake games - was asked about changing story elements without altering the impact of the original game.



&quot;We approached the FF7 Remake project with the aim to make it something that could be enjoyed by both fans of the original game and people who did not know it,&quot; said Kitase.

It will include both a fast travel system and rideable creatures, to ensure players can explore to the full.

                              <span>Unlike previous episodes in the series, episode four (known as &quot;Please Hold To My Hand&quot;) of The Last of Us could be cosidered part one of, I assume, two. Last week&#x27;s episode was largely its own, self contained, installment. Meanwhile, episode one and two both had a very clearly defined break in the narrative at their close. 


A lot of episode four, however, feels like it is setting us up for episode five. It is laying down the groundwork for what is next, and asks more questions than it answers. 


But even though this may be the case, there is still plenty to discuss. Let&#x27;s dive on in.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly ready to fight what it expects to be opposition from the UK&#x27;s competition regulator.

According to the New York Times (£) (thanks, VGC), the megacorp believes &quot;the antitrust authority in Britain to oppose the transaction&quot;. It follows a similar intervention from the EU, which objected to a perceived risk in Microsoft owning Call of Duty given it could reduce competition in the video games industry.

According to four people &quot;briefed on the matter who were not authorised to speak publicly&quot;, Microsoft hopes &quot;to convince both Britain and the European Union to accept its concessions and approve the deal, which could make it easier for the company to reach an agreement with the FTC before the scheduled administrative trial starts in the summer&quot;.

Whilst the links to screengrabs and the video itself have since been removed from Reddit - although they can be found elsewhere on the internet without too much effort - the original post describing the 20-minute gameplay video remains accessible. 

There may be spoilers ahead, so please don&#x27;t proceed unless you&#x27;re happy to be spoiled!

                              <span>After &quot;one last&quot; delay for Sons of the Forest late last year, developer Endnight Games has announced the horror will release in Early Access at the end of this month rather than be delayed again.

Endnight says it&#x27;s made the decision to release in early access in order to &quot;involve the community in the continued development of this project&quot; - which it says led to the &quot;massive success&quot; of predecessor The Forest - whilst also &quot;keep[ing its] 23rd February release date&quot;.

&quot;It’s been a long journey since we first started Sons of The Forest development, and it’s grown into the biggest, most complex game we have ever made,&quot; the team said in a statement posted on Steam.

The update will introduce new continent, Rowen, &quot;where players will encounter two competing factions: Preigelli and Liebertane, who are competing for Sylmael, crimson jewels that are a precious resource in Arkesia&quot;. 

Complete the Rowen world quests, and you&#x27;ll be able to choose a faction for open-world PvP, but Amazon Games teases that &quot;the battle is just beginning&quot;, and the competition &quot;will heat up further in March, when the Tulubik Battlefield releases&quot;.

                              <span>The field of machine learning (ML) security—and corresponding adversarial ML—is rapidly advancing as researchers develop sophisticated techniques to perturb, disrupt, or steal the ML model or data. It’s a heady time; because we know so little about the security of these systems, there are many opportunities for new researchers to publish in this field. In many ways, this circumstance reminds me of the cryptanalysis field in the 1990. And there is a lesson in that similarity: the complex mathematical attacks make for good academic papers, but we mustn’t lose sight of the fact that insecure software will be the likely attack vector for most ML systems...</span>

The Kubernetes project runs a community-owned image registry called registry.k8s.io to host its container images. On the 3rd of April 2023, the old registry k8s.gcr.io will be frozen and no further images for Kubernetes and related subprojects will be pushed to the old registry.
This registry registry.k8s.io replaced the old one and has been generally available for several months. We have published a blog post about its benefits to the community and the Kubernetes project. This post also announced that future versions of Kubernetes will not be available in the old registry. Now that time has come.
What does this change mean for contributors:

                              <span>A second Wo Long Fallen Dynasty demo will be available from 24th February.

The bite-sized snippet of Team Ninja&#x27;s dark Soulslike fantasy will be playable on PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X, and last-gen consoles, too, which is good news for anyone who missed out on the PS5/XSX-only demo last time.

As is usually the case, save data from your time with the demo will &quot;transfer to the final game&quot;, and if you complete it, you&#x27;ll unlock the &quot;Crouching Dragon Helmet&quot; DLC in the full game, too.

                              <span>Pedro Pascal has taken his gruff portrayal of The Last of Us&#x27; Joel and applied it to an entirely different kind of video game character: Mario.

In a spoof teaser for a completely made-up TV adaptation of Mario Kart on Saturday Night Live last night (4th February), Pascal and the SNL team showed what could happen if HBO applied the same kind of treatment to a Mario adaptation. And it&#x27;s brilliant. 

“HBO’s The Last of Us is a hit, proving that a video game can become a prestige dystopian drama. In Spring, HBO is doing it again with another iconic game,&quot; claims the profound - if overdramatic - voiceover.

                              <span>An American judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against Nintendo for its Joy-Con drift issues, saying the case cannot proceed because the owners agreed to Nintendo&#x27;s End User License Agreement (EULA) that &quot;disallows lawsuits&quot;.

Despite attempts to argue that underaged children - who used the handheld system - cannot enter into the agreement, the federal judge ultimately ruled that the agreement was with the &quot;de facto owners&quot;, the parents, and not the children who actually used the console. 

Consequently, the judge dismissed the action, stating that the parents should have entered legal arbitration rather than a lawsuit, as instructed by the EULA (thanks, NE).

                              <span>Capcom has released 12 whole minutes of new Resident Evil 4 Remake footage. 

Capcom partnered with Game Informer to share the new teaser, sharing &quot;an extended gameplay walkthrough of the game’s fifth chapter&quot;, set right after Leon meets Ashley. You can check it out below (thanks, Resetera):

As well as showing off the church and cemetery sequences - and lots of meaty combat, of course, including a battle with Luis Serra - the video also reveals a sneaky QTE (you&#x27;ll find it at 6.38 mins in) which is interesting given Resident Evil 4 Remake reportedly has &quot;barely any&quot; QTEs at all.

The 40-player battle royale mode introduces two new weapons - the long-range Grenade Launcher and the Scythe - as well as new premium character Ruby Knowby, voiced by Lucy Lawless. There&#x27;s also a new free Kandarian Facelift outfit for Pablo, too.

Alongside the free battle royale mode, players can also get hold of the Immortal Power DLC Bundle, which includes Ruby Knowby, who - as a dark one - can regenerate health, increase her possession resistance, and boost the damage of her weapons. She can also &quot;consume souls to make her aura stronger and charger her unique ability, triggering a deadly blast that damages evil units within range and heals nearby Survivors&quot;.

                              <span>Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco has revealed plans to host an &quot;event&quot; on the critically-acclaimed game&#x27;s first anniversary.

Bandai Namco invited fans to &quot;save the date&quot; of an anniversary event set to take place on 25th February in Stockholm, Sweden. Fans who can&#x27;t be there in person can join in via a livestream on Twitch.

The &quot;live show&quot; will host &quot;giveaways, contests, exclusive prizes, pub quiz, drinks, cosplay, and PvP&quot;. And whilst there&#x27;s no formal word about the eagerly-anticipated DLC, I doubt it&#x27;ll surprise you to hear that fans are desperately hoping that this may be when From Software finally drops more information. Watch this space, I guess.

Schafer - best known for games like Grim Fandango, Psychonauts, and Broken Age - will be honoured at the 26th annual DICE event later this month (not to be confused with EA&#x27;s Stockholm studio of the same name).

&quot;Tim&#x27;s creative impact on the industry cannot be understated,&quot; said Meggan Scavio, president of the AIAS. &quot;For over 30 years, he has heralded imaginative games that have inspired countless others with his humour and originality. We are thrilled for Tim to be inducted into our Hall of Fame.&quot;

                              <span>Activision Blizzard will pay $35m USD to settle charges raised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following a probe relating to workplace misconduct.


The SEC launched its investigation into Activision Blizzard in September 2021, subpoenaing CEO Bobby Kotick and other senior executives to provide their internal communications regarding the company&#x27;s response to the high-profile allegations of widespread misconduct and harassment within the company.


After concluding its investigation, the SEC charged that the publisher had failed to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that would ensure it could adequately collect and analyse employees&#x27; complaints of workplace misconduct. As a result, it said, Activision Blizzard&#x27;s management lacked sufficient information to &quot;understand the volume and substance of employee complaints about workplace misconduct&quot;, leaving it without the means to determine whether larger issues existed that needed to be disclosed to investors.

                              <span>Developer Smilegate has announced the impending closure of its year-old Xbox multiplayer shooter CrossfireX, which will shut down on 18th May - a move that&#x27;ll also affect its Remedy developed single-player campaign.


CrossfireX - the console version of Smilegate&#x27;s hugely popular PC shooter Crossfire - launched for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S last February, combining the multiplayer component of the PC original with a specially developed single-player campaign.


A little over a year on from that troubled launch, Smilegate has announced it&#x27;ll soon be ending support for the game. &quot;It is with the deepest regret that we are informing you of our decision to end support for CrossfireX on May 18, 2023,&quot; it wrote in a statement on its website. &quot;Since the launch of the game, we have worked tirelessly to bring it to a point where we can all be proud, and throughout it all we have had the honour and pleasure of supporting our players.&quot;

Innersloth&#x27;s roadmap is a little light in terms of ETAs, but it&#x27;s first order of business - user interface and user experience updates for Among Us - are said to be &quot;coming soon&quot;.


&quot;We want to make playing Among Us an easier, more intuitive experience,&quot; the developer explained in a post accompanying its new roadmap. &quot;This means big focus on adding multiple updates to the UI and UX...of the game. Cleaning up the account merging flow, updating the store to be easier to navigate, making it easier to see how you can report a toxic player... these are all things we want to work on, and more.&quot;

I have done a written interview and a  podcast interview about the book. It’s been chosen as a “February 2023 Must-Read Book” by the Next Big Idea Club. And an “Editor’s Pick”—whatever that means—on Amazon.
There have been three reviews so far. I am hoping for more. And maybe even a published excerpt or two.
Amazon and others will start shipping the book on Tuesday. If you ordered a signed copy from me, it is already in the mail.
If you can leave a review somewhere, I would appreciate it.

The Last of Us Part 1 - Naughty Dog&#x27;s new-gen spruce-up of the acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror - initially launched for PlayStation 5 last September, and the long-promised PC version was eventually confirmed to be arriving on 3rd March this year.


With a month to go until its originally planned launch date, however, Naughty Dog has confirmed a 25-day delay. &quot;Let&#x27;s get right to it,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We initially announced The Last of Us Part 1 PC release would be 3rd March, but we&#x27;ve decided to push its launch date out by just a few week; it will now be released on 28th March.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has responded to the European Union&#x27;s now-formalised antitrust warning, slapped down to contest its attempt at an Activision Blizzard acquistion. 


The EU&#x27;s intent to object to Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn deal was first reported last month. Now it has been finalised - and Microsoft has said it was &quot;confident&quot; it could address the issues raised.


As expected, the EU has intervened over a percieved risk in Microsoft owning Call of Duty, something it fears could reduce competition in the video games industry, Politico reported today.

                              <span>Legendary game designer Jeff Minter&#x27;s psychedelic reimagining of Atari&#x27;s &#x27;80s arcade prototype Akka Arrh comes to PC and consoles on 21st February.


The original Akka Arrh was created by Atari&#x27;s Mike Hally and Dave Ralston in 1982, but the unfinished prototype never went into full production and only three cabinets are still said to exist. More recently, however, the prototype did get an airing in last year&#x27;s superb Atari 50: Anniversary Celebration collection.


Minter&#x27;s reimagining of Akka Arrh will take the core of the original and build it out into &quot;a cascade of words, colour, shapes and sound [flowing] around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers&quot;.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Facial Misrecognition Systems: Simple Weight Manipulations Force DNNs to Err Only on Specific Persons“:
Abstract: In this paper we describe how to plant novel types of backdoors in any facial recognition model based on the popular architecture of deep Siamese neural networks, by mathematically changing a small fraction of its weights (i.e., without using any additional training or optimization). These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other’s existence with almost no interference...</span>

Observability requires the right data at the right time for the right consumer
(human or piece of software) to make the right decision. In the context of Kubernetes,
having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial.
SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools
that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the API server,
scheduler, kubelet and kube-controller-manager.
In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed,
SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with Elana Hashman,
and Han Kang, chairs of SIG Instrumentation,
on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute.
