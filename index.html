                              <span>It looks like Valve won&#x27;t be releasing an OLED model of its handheld Steam Deck in the near future.

Steam Deck designer Pierre-Loup Griffais commented on the feasibility of an OLED model in an interview with PC Gamer, in which he explained why it won&#x27;t be possible in the near future.

&quot;The screen&#x27;s at the core of the device,&quot; Griffais explained. Putting in an OLED screen to replace the Steam Deck&#x27;s LCD screen wouldn&#x27;t be a simple swap, he continued, as all of the components are architected around each other for a device that&#x27;s so small.

However, if you will excuse the unintentional pun, there have been some teething issues with this update, and several Simmers have noticed their adorable babies aging up into long-legged monstrosities. 


A collection of posts across Reddit and the EA answers HQ reveal that some infants are appearing with a significantly stretched body, leaving them to look like they are atop some kind of humanoid stilts.

Xevious and Side Pocket, two ports of arcade games, join the NES and SNES libraries respectively. Xevious is a scrolling shooter with similarities to Space Invaders, whilst Side Pocket is a billiards simulation.

I might boot that one up to fill the void in my life that Miniclip&#x27;s 8 Ball Pool left behind.

                              <span>A swathe of top talent from Burnout and Need for Speed developer Criterion has left the studio to form a fresh company, Fuse Games.


The news follows last year&#x27;s underwhelming launch of Need for Speed Unbound, which arrived to a warm critical response but little fanfare from publisher EA.


Fuse Games will be led by former Criterion boss Matt Webster, with four former Criterion co-founders in senior roles. Together, the team has worked together for nearly two decades on Criterion&#x27;s various projects: Burnout, Battlefield, Star Wars: Battlefront and Need for Speed.

                              <span>Baked beans and ketchup maker Heinz has built a tomato awareness campaign in Fortnite, using a map that attempts to recreate one of its own tomato farms. 


Dubbed &quot;SOS Tomatoes&quot;, the map is designed to highlight a genuine good cause: the falling levels of soil quality  worldwide due to over farming. Information on the map will detail more about the threats to soil health - and hopefully provide some proper STEM learning.


Heinz describes the experience as a &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot;, with a faster shrinking storm to... highlight the &quot;rapid rate at which soil health is declining&quot;. Now that&#x27;s quite the pickle.

                              <span>Criterion and EA have unveiled Need for Speed Unbound: Volume 2, a free content update coming to all platforms next Wednesday, 21st March.


Volume 2 - said to be the first in what will presumably be a series of post-launch updates for Criterion&#x27;s well-received racer - looks to bring a little bit more of everything, starting with the introduction of cop chases in multiplayer. &quot;Stay ahead of the chase to make Bank while your friends help knock them off your tail,&quot; is how Criterion explains the addition in its announcement, &quot;or take the Heat off you for their own rewards.


Alongside multiplayer cop skirmishes - which come complete with new banner rewards - Volume 2 ushers in Daily Challenges, with players able to complete up to three (selected from a pool of 40) each day in order to earn XP and Bank. There&#x27;s also a &quot;special luxury ride&quot; for those that complete enough challenges.

                              <span>With a year almost expired since Ghostwire: Tokyo&#x27;s launch on PC and PS5 as a timed console exclusive, Bethesda has announced the game is making the leap to Xbox Series X/S on 12th April - complete with new content for all platforms. 


Ghostwire: Tokyo, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, comes from The Evil Within and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, plunging players into a supernaturally hued open world jaunt around an absolutely gorgeously rendered Tokyo - one almost entirely purged of human life thanks to some nefarious shenanigans.


Reviews were middling at launch thanks to some rather same-y combat and some basic mechanical building blocks that are recycled just a little bit too often, but, personally, I&#x27;ve been having a blast of late bounding across Tokyo&#x27;s rooftops, sucking up souls, and getting a thorough (and often quite spooky) education in Japan&#x27;s rich folklore.

                              <span>Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games is still struggling with game maintenance after the release of its latest update.


That update makes steps towards the game&#x27;s ideal of full in-game persistence, with the addition of Persistent Entity Streaming tech now implemented in Alpha 3.18. It means objects can be dynamically tracked when moved by players.


However, the update has attracted enough players back to the game that login and server issues have become a major problem for the developer.

Burning Shores will see Forbidden West&#x27;s protagonist Aloy heading out to the &quot;untamed wilds of Los Angeles&quot; following the events of Forbidden West&#x27;s main campaign.
However, despite the base game releasing across both PlayStation 5 and PS4 consoles, Burning Shores is a PS5 exclusive.

The hugely-talented animator Cara Aleatorio has recreated Resident Evil 4&#x27;s opening in digital Lego, in a polished and surprisingly authentic homage.


From the original audio cues and camera angles taken from the game to the wear, tear and thumbprints on the digital Lego models, this is quite the treat for those who have this opening to the original Resident Evil 4 seared in their brains.

The developer has now responded to the accusations, stating the response received from Epic was &quot;not satisfactory for us&quot;.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has confirmed that, after eight years and with a sequel in sight, the end is nigh for Cities: Skylines&#x27; DLC support, with a final selection of content arriving in May.


The news comes as Cities: Skylines developer Colossal Order - which recently announced a long-awaited sequel for release this year - shares one last roadmap for its acclaimed city building game, starting with a first drop of DLC next Wednesday, 22nd March.


This&#x27;ll take the form of three new Content Creator Packs - Africa in Miniature, Sports Venues, and Shopping Malls - plus three new radio stations. JADIA Radio Station brings 16 Africa-inspired tracks from musician Wan Shey, while 80&#x27;s Movie Tunes is a fairly self-explanatory set of 15 tracks totally around 70 minutes of music. Finally, there&#x27;s Pop-Punk Radio, which promises 16 track and 75 minutes of &quot;powerful, high-beat tunes&quot;.

                              <span>The messy saga of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM - which has been embroiled in a series of legal tussles relating to the involuntary departure of key team members in 2021 - has reached a new milestone, with the company announcing several of those lawsuits have now been resolved.


It&#x27;s a story that first made headlines last October, when ZA/UM founder Martin Luiga claimed Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov had been fired following the company&#x27;s takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus (now ZA/UM CEO), and Tõnis Haavel, previously convicted of investment fraud.


Not long after confirming the news of their departure, Kurvitz and Rostov shared an open letter claiming Kompus and Haavel&#x27;s takeover of ZA/UM was fraudulent and that they were booted out of the studio while trying to discover more. Kompus and Haavel then fired back, insisting the former employees had been dismissed for &quot;belittling women and co-workers&quot;, creating a &quot;toxic environment&quot;, and &quot;intending to steal IP&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Heart Machine has shared a first gameplay trailer for Hyper Light Breaker - its fully 3D rogue-lite follow-up to 2016&#x27;s acclaimed Hyper Light Drifter - alongside the news it&#x27;ll be entering Steam early access some time this autumn.


Hyper Light Breaker, which was unveiled last March, trades its predecessor&#x27;s wonderfully explorable top-down, 2D world in favour of a &quot;vast, ever-changing&quot; 3D landscape - blending handcrafted and procedurally generated elements - known as the Overgrowth.


Here, amid open biomes and deep labyrinths, players (working solo or with up to three friends) can deploy a mix of acrobatic abilities - wall-dashing, hoverboarding, gliding - and third-person combat as they take on monsters and bosses in an attempt to overthrow the Abyss King.

                              <span>Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive has slapped a 4th April launch date on its first-person building and raiding game Meet Meet Your Maker, confirming that - alongside its PlayStation, Xbox, and PC retail release - it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation Plus on day one.


Meet Your Maker whisks players (either solo or along with a co-op friend) to a post-apocalyptic wasteland where they&#x27;re able to build their own maze-like outpost filled with devious traps and patrolling guards. Once the stage is (literally) set, that outpost is then hoovered up into the internet ether, whereupon other players can raid it in an attempt to best its challenge.


&quot;Every outpost in Meet Your Maker requires you build a clear path from its entrance to the Genmat at its core,&quot; Behaviour Interactive explains in a post on the PlayStation Blog, &quot;but nothing says this path should be easy to navigate... Twisting hallways, verticality, multiple branching corridors, and trap-filled dead ends are all great ways to confound raiders.&quot;

                              <span>Tekken veteran Marshall Law has always been a pretty on the nose copy of legendary martial arts movie star Bruce Lee, but his incarnation in the upcoming Tekken 8 ramps the familiarity up another notch.


Bandai Namco released a gameplay video showing off Marshall Law in Tekken 8, below, and it includes all the Bruce Lee mannerisms you&#x27;d expect: the &#x27;come and get some&#x27; hand signal, the high-pitched noises, the nose flick and the finger point.


In the trailer we see Law use nunchucks as Lee famously did in his iconic Hollywood hit Enter the Dragon. He also flexes his muscles as Lee did in his movies. He even copies Lee&#x27;s facial expressions.

                              <span>Meta, the owner of Facebook and maker of Meta Quest VR headsets, will cut a further 10,000 jobs this year and close around 5000 additional open roles, as part of a &quot;year of efficiency&quot;.


These cuts come on top of the previous 10,000 job losses announced back in November last year, which equated to a loss of 13 percent of all Meta employees globally. 


Announcing the changes publicly via his Facebook page, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg blamed higher US interest rates, global geopolitical instability and increased regulation, on top of last year&#x27;s slowdown in revenue which he dubbed as a &quot;humbling wake-up call&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox has today announced another 10-year agreement, this time with Ukranian cloud gaming platform Boosteroid, as Microsoft continues to try and shore up support for its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal.


Boosteroid&#x27;s four million users will soon be able to access Xbox PC games via their streaming subscription, with Activision Blizzard PC games to also become available when (or rather, if) Microsoft&#x27;s buyout takes place.


It&#x27;s a very similar deal to the one Microsoft previously announced with Nvidia to bring Xbox PC games its GeForce Now streaming service.

That date will apply to the game&#x27;s release on all major PC platforms, including Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store. 


&quot;We had hoped to bring the game to market by the end of March,&quot; publisher Plaion acknowledged, &quot;but that turned out to be just beyond our reach; we are after all merely human (unlike Shodan!)&quot;

                              <span>The Last of Us&#x27; series finale aired earlier this week, breaking another viewership record for HBO in the process. 


This episode concluded our journey to the Fireflies, and featured a particular sequence that many have dubbed Joel&#x27;s &quot;John Wick moment&quot; (I am sure there is a Naughty Dog pun in here somewhere).


Now, co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have shared a little bit more on this part of the series, calling it a &quot;God mode power up&quot;.

Now it&#x27;s actually happened, as Yaza Games announced that Andreas from Pentiment is playable in its ink-based strategy game about farting donkeys.


Andreas is playable in both the Journey mode and in Duels.

                              <span>Another week, another record breaking episode debut for The Last of Us.


The show&#x27;s season finale, which aired on Sunday evening/Monday morning depending on which side of the pond you are, saw 8.2 million viewers tuning in for the conclusion of Joel and Ellie&#x27;s journey to find the Fireflies. This number is for viewers across &quot;HBO Max and linear telecasts&quot;, and based on Nielsen and first party data.


In a press release, HBO stated the series is currently averaging 30.4 million viewers across its first six episodes. Its pilot episode, meanwhile, is now approaching 40 million viewers. These figures make The Last of Us &quot;the most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in both Europe and Latin America&quot;.

                              <span>Following reports that E3 2023 would be a no-show for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, Microsoft has confirmed it won&#x27;t have a show floor presence at this year&#x27;s event - although its recently announced online showcase will be part of an E3-branded week of digital shows.


News that the big three console manufacturers would be skipping this year&#x27;s E3 - set to be held between 13th and 16th June - was first reported by IGN in January. One month later, Nintendo confirmed its absence, saying, &quot;We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis [and] this year&#x27;s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans&quot;.


It wasn&#x27;t particularly surprising news, given Nintendo hasn&#x27;t held a major E3 conference for over a decade now and last had a showfloor presence at E3 back in 2019, but there were hopes that this year&#x27;s organiser (Eurogamer parent company Reedpop) might be able to coax the major players back in its attempts to revitalise a flagging formula - which, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, hasn&#x27;t had an in-person component since 2019.

                              <span>CD Projekt has released a new patch for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, addressing a number of issues affecting the game&#x27;s troubled next-gen upgrade.


The Witcher 3&#x27;s long-in-the-works next-gen update finally arrived late last year, but was plagued by reports of technical issues and poor performance on both PC and consoles.


CD Projekt&#x27;s first big stab at remedying these problems arrived in February&#x27;s 4.01 patch, but, despite some progress, issues persisted. As Digital Foundry noted, for example, while PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X saw some performance improvements in their 30fps ray-tracing mode, 60fps Performance Mode had somehow ended up considerably worse.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has insisted it remains &quot;committed&quot; to Call of Duty: Mobile after Microsoft recently told UK regulators the game could be &quot;phased out&quot; over time with the full launch of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile this year.


Microsoft made the claims in its latest response to the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority, which is currently investigating the company&#x27;s proposed $69BN USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In a paragraph on divestment, Microsoft noted, &quot;Call of Duty: Mobile is expected to be phased out over time (outside of China) with the launch of Warzone Mobile.&quot;


Call of Duty: Mobile - a free-to-play spin on the juggernaut franchise, developed by Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio - launched in 2019 and has been a massive success for Activision, generating $3BN in its first year alone.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Doug Bowser has addressed the company&#x27;s decision to slap the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with a $70 price tag in the US, saying it&#x27;s not &quot;necessarily&quot; a price point it&#x27;ll apply to all its titles in the future.


Nintendo confirmed Tears of the Kingdom would retail for $69.99 in the US - $10 above the price it usually adopts for its big blockbuster titles - at the start of February, leading some to wonder if this may be the new standard for the company&#x27;s games moving forward.


The move would certain align with a growing number of other publishers - including Sony, Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft, and Take-Two - who&#x27;ve recently looked to position $70 as the new normal for many of their games on consoles.

Nearly 90% of the multibillion-dollar federal lobbying apparatus in the United States serves corporate interests. In some cases, the objective of that money is obvious. Google pours millions into lobbying on bills related to antitrust regulation. Big energy companies expect action whenever there is a move to end drilling leases for federal lands, in exchange for the tens of millions they contribute to congressional reelection campaigns.
But lobbying strategies are not always so blunt, and the interests involved are not always so obvious. ...</span>

A Croatian national has been arrested for allegedly operating NetWire, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) marketed on cybercrime forums since 2012 as a stealthy way to spy on infected systems and siphon passwords. The arrest coincided with a seizure of the NetWire sales website by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). While the defendant in this case hasn’t yet been named publicly, the NetWire website has been leaking information about the likely true identity and location of its owner for the past 11 years.

                              <span>There will be &quot;a lot more infected&quot; when The Last of Us&#x27; second season airs.


That&#x27;s coming from series co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin. Ahead of the first season&#x27;s finale (which aired last night/early this morning, depending on where you are. You can read my spoiler-heavy thoughts on it here), Druckmann and Mazin took part in a virtual press conference for the show. 


Here, they addressed the first season&#x27;s somewhat reduced action compared to the game it is based on. Please note, this article contains spoilers for both the show and the game. Please read on at your own discretion.

This episode - Look for the Light - is an emotional one, and as ever leaves plenty to discuss with you all.

Having played the demo in its standard form, I headed over to Nexus mods to see what was what. And I was not disappointed. 


First up, we have the &quot;Banana gun and spoon knife&quot; mod uploaded by Stevebg23. This chap does exactly what it says on the tin - it replaces the Standard Handgun and the Survival Knife with a banana and a spoon.

                              <span>Cloud Imperium Games has launched a new update for the infamous MMO Star Citizen to make its world more persistent.


Alpha 3.18: Lasting Legacies has added Persistent Entity Streaming tech that allows objects moved by players to be dynamically tracked on specific servers, meaning players can now leave their mark on the world. 


The developer claims this makes the game &quot;one of the most immersive and &#x27;lived-in&#x27; experiences ever seen in games&quot;. Further, this technical update is a critical addition in laying the foundation for full in-game persistence.

A number of images and videos have been shared online with side-by-side comparisons of the animations used in Bleak Faith and Elden Ring, which admittedly do look identical.


However, developer Archangel Studios has stated that animations and art have been taken from the Epic Marketplace.

If players are canny, they can come across the TMP (or, &#x27;tactical machine pistol&#x27;). This weapon holds 50 rounds at once, and makes things a lot easier for those pitting themselves against the hoards of parasite-infested villagers.


To get hold of this weapon in the demo, you will need to discard everything in your inventory before getting to the village.

In a recent update, creative director Nate Simpson stated the KSP2 team is continuing to make &quot;good headway on performance improvement and bug squashing&quot;. This has meant that, in addition to the previous list of upcoming fixes, the developer has managed to &quot;sneak&quot; a few more improvements into KSP2&#x27;s first patch. 


These include &quot;a fairly high-impact resource flow optimisation&quot; and a fix for the &quot;&#x27;Kraken Drive&#x27; bug that created insane reverse thrust when an engine&#x27;s nozzle was obstructed&quot;.

The hack, claimed by a community from a Russian social network, comes ahead of the game&#x27;s release later this year. 


The studio has released a statement on Twitter in response, requesting fans refrain from sharing leaked material and spoilers.

                              <span>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has once again broken its all-time concurrent PC user peak, 11 years after it launched on Steam, and just a month after setting the last record.

The shooter - which has been around in one form or another for over 20 years at this point - recently surpassed its own concurrent record, hitting an all-time peak of 1.32 million players last month.

In a tweet on the game&#x27;s official Twitter account over the weekend, the team thanked its 1.4m Twitter followers for &quot;organising and playing CS:GO concurrently today&quot;, which was a very smooth segue into noting the shooter&#x27;s all-new concurrent record.

                              <span>Amazon Games has outlined a little more about Lost Ark&#x27;s all-new advanced class, Artist, including an explanation about why it chose to &quot;make localisation updates&quot; that modified Artists skins to make them less sexualised and &quot;better fit Western norms&quot;.

The first in an &quot;entirely new class category&quot; called Specialists, the Artist is &quot;capable of tactical versatility with illusion powers, and specialises in supporting her team&quot;.

&quot;The Artist’s Class identity is built around the Harmony Meter Identity Gauge,&quot; Amazon explains. &quot;Landing skills on enemies will fill up three Harmony Orbs which can be used to cast two Identity Skills – Moonfall and Sunrise.

                              <span>We already knew that Endnight&#x27;s early access survival horror Sons of the Forest has been a big hit – it almost instantly blew up on Steam, and managed to sell &quot;over two million copies in the first 24 hours&quot; – but now that success is tipping over into its fan-favourite predecessor, too.

As detailed on the PS Blog, predecessor The Forest has seen a spike in player count, too, proving to be a favourite for players on Sony consoles as well as PC.

Whilst the game has been, admittedly, consistently popular, since the release of Sons of the Forest, the prequel has catapulted back into PlayStation&#x27;s Top 10 chart. According to Sony, it was the eighth most-downloaded PS4 game in the US/Canada in February, and the third most-downloaded in Europe, with only Minecraft and The Last of Us Part 2 proving more popular.

&quot;It was at that moment when we basically had to make decisions about Stadia that we realized that, at Google Cloud, we are at our best when we’re helping other people build this stuff, not necessarily building it ourselves,&quot; Google Cloud’s director of game industry solutions, Jack Buser, told Axios.

&quot;We want to thank you all for your support with Lemnis Gate, joining us for many incredible rounds in the loop,&quot; the statement said - the game&#x27;s first Steam update since December 2021. &quot;We&#x27;ve truly loved seeing your passion for the game, the mind-bending strategies you created and how you embraced this innovative twist on the FPS genre.

In a new interview, the game&#x27;s original director Masato Kato and composer Yasunori Mitsuda acknowledged that whilst originally a way to commemorate the RPG&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition also sought to ensure the game would be playable in the future even without backwards compatibility.

&quot;Back when the project was launched, Chrono Cross was possibly going to become unplayable,&quot; remaster producer Koichiro Sakamoto explained in an interview, as spotted by GamesRadar+.

Whilst Spector has not indicated his next steps nor revealed who&#x27;ll be taking over his position, he did confirm his departure on his personal Twitter account, insisting that the franchise would remain &quot;in great hands&quot; with colleagues Aaron Keller and Jared Neuss.

&quot;After 6 amazing years, I’ve decided to hang up my sword and am leaving Blizzard at the end of March,&quot; Spector announced in a Twitter thread (thanks, TheGamer). &quot;Working on Overwatch has been the highlight of my career – Team 4 brings immense talent and passion to their work every day.

There&#x27;s also &quot;more dynamic gameplay&quot; - described as &quot;fewer walking&quot; and &quot;more intense and terrifying&quot; scenes - as well as new puzzles, a photo mode, bug squishing, and a new &quot;hidden game ending&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to industry leaker Dusk Golem, who took to Twitter overnight to warn that we should &quot;be careful on social media and video sharing sites&quot; if we&#x27;d like to remain spoiler-free before the game formally releases on 24th March.

&quot;Just as a heads-up, Resident Evil 4 Remake is 100% in the wild, seen some clips people notified me about in a few places. Won&#x27;t share them, but if [you] want to avoid spoilers, now&#x27;s the time to start treading carefully,&quot; Golem tweeted.

The co-operative four-player horror game – which some of you may have experienced over the spooky season back in October as part of its closed beta test - will not be getting a full release, however, but instead launch into early access on 18th May 2023.

According to the development team, last year&#x27;s closed beta test provided &quot;insightful feedback and very interesting data&quot;, which has been used to &quot;improve&quot; the game.

                              <span>With several delays now behind it, a release is finally in sight for The Lord of the Rings: Gollum - and ahead of its arrival later this year, developer Daedelic Entertainment has shared a fresh look at its stealthy action in a new gameplay trailer.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is, if you&#x27;re unaware, forging something of a unusual path through Middle-earth, taking its wide-eyed protagonist on an adventure that promises moments of both &quot;subtle tactical stealth&quot; and &quot;fast-paced parkour action&quot; across a mixture of open levels and more linear missions.


It&#x27;s a journey - one set before the events of The Lord of the Rings, chronology fans - that&#x27;ll span some familiar locales,  ranging from the the mountains of Mordor to Mirkwood Forest. And it&#x27;s all shot through with an intriguing branching narrative element that&#x27;ll affect gameplay situations, dialogue, even animations and sound, depending on whether players give prominence to Gollum or the Sméagol side of his personality.

                              <span>Three weeks after Wild Hearts&#x27; arrival, developer Omega Force has released the first free post-launch content update for its wonderful Monster-Hunter-like, this one introducing a new Kemono variant - the Hellfire Laharaback - plus a heap of balance adjustments and fixes.


Hellfire Laharaback is an extremely powerful variant of the base game&#x27;s Lavaback (it&#x27;s officially classed as a Volatile Kemono according to Omega Force, meaning it&#x27;s very much considered end-game content) and arrives as part of a new quest challenging players to &quot;quell the torrid inferno before it reduces everything to ash, and restore tranquility to the island.&quot;


Defeating the Hellfire Laharaback will reward players with the new Fire Fiend Appeaser title, and the chance to acquire the new Infernal Blow skill, which increases the likelihood of setting targets ablaze and boosts the power of attacks against burning targets.

                              <span>Publisher Dotemu&#x27;s stupendous beat-&#x27;em-up revival Streets of Rage 4 has just received a big free update on all platforms, adding the likes of new co-op moves and a custom survival mode.


For the most part, today&#x27;s update is focused on fixes, tweaks, and balance adjustments - over 300 in total, according to Dotemu - designed to finesse the already stellar core experience. These range from the addition of new destructible objects around stages to help maintain combo counters, to specific character improvements.


However, there&#x27;re also new co-op-focused moves, including the ability to sling your partner across the screen - at which point they&#x27;re able to hit a button and perform a special attack.

                              <span>In honour of international Mario Day (bafflingly still not officially a public holiday), Lego and Nintendo have announced a fresh collection of Super-Mario-themed sets, including a new take on Bowser Castle and a tease that Donkey Kong is on the way.


Lego&#x27;s Super Mario line launched back in 2020, and has so far seen the release of over 60 interactive, connectable sets - although a number of more complex sets, including Mighty Bowser, have been released outside the Lego Super Mario branding.


For its Mario Day reveal, though, Lego has returned to its Super Mario line, revealing the Dry Bowser Castle Battle set - not to be confused with the already released Bowser&#x27;s Castle Boss Battle expansion, in case you were sure you&#x27;d seen similar before.

On Monday, March 20th, the k8s.gcr.io registry will be redirected to the community owned
registry,
registry.k8s.io .
TL;DR: What you need to know about this change
On Monday, March 20th, traffic from the older k8s.gcr.io registry will be redirected to
registry.k8s.io with the eventual goal of sunsetting k8s.gcr.io.
If you run in a restricted environment, and apply strict domain name or IP address access policies
limited to k8s.gcr.io, the image pulls will not function after k8s.gcr.io starts redire…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a gameplay trailer for veteran Tekken character Paul in the upcoming Tekken 8 and while the famously hard-hitting puncher hits as hard as I&#x27;d hoped, it&#x27;s his hair that&#x27;s caught my eye.


We&#x27;ve known rough and tumble Paul had let his hair down for Tekken 8 since his redesign was unveiled last year, but seeing this new video, below, crystalises how I feel about his do - and it&#x27;s not good. Rather than pore over his moveset (yes, the Deathfist is present and correct), I found myself fussing over Paul&#x27;s fancy locks, which appear to have a life of their own.


Paul has one of the most iconic hairdos in video games. The physics-busting blonde hightop has been a key part of Paul&#x27;s look ever since Tekken exploded onto the scene in 1994.

After a long wait for a new entry in the series, New World of Steam will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series&#x27; action to America.


It&#x27;s here that Layton&#x27;s former protégé Luke has been living following the events of 2010&#x27;s The Unwound Future, and where he has since made a name for himself as a local detective. The newly-arrived Layton, meanwhile, is an unknown - and so in this game the usual rookie/pro relationship will be reversed.

                              <span>Sons of the Forest has received its first patch, and let me tell you, it is a thorough one. 


With this update, the Early Access game will now include items such as binoculars and hang gliders. There is also a new mini-boss battle for you to test your mettle against (although, just as a heads up, this patch has also halved shotgun damage, so something to bear in mind if you go in guns blazing).


In addition to the above, a range of other quality of life features have also been implemented thanks to the game&#x27;s first patch. Players will now be able to lock doors, berries have been tweaked to give slightly more fullness and there are a variety of animation improvements.

                              <span>Bill&#x27;s hometown of Lincoln from The Last of Us has been reimagined in The Sims 4.


This impressive recreation comes from Sims 4 builder Isambardy. Taking inspiration from episode three of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation, which focused on survivors Bill and Frank, Isambardy used EA&#x27;s life simulation game to build a condensed version of Lincoln. 
As both a The Last of Us and The Sims 4 fan, I have to say I absolutely love the end result.

                              <span>Forspoken publisher Square Enix has admitted the game&#x27;s sales were &quot;lacklustre&quot;, and that critical reviews of the title had been &quot;challenging&quot;. 


Its underperformance, coupled with that of &quot;many&quot; smaller games also released by Square Enix in the past year, has left the publisher unsure whether it will achieve its previous target of year-on-year financial growth. 


&quot;Reviews of Forspoken... have been challenging,&quot; Square Enix stated in a new financial results presentation. &quot;However, the game has also received positive feedback on its action features, including its parkour and combat capabilities, so it has yielded results that will lead to improvement of our development capabilities of other games in the future.

                              <span>Rapper and producer Curtis &quot;50 Cent&quot; Jackson is developing a TV series named Vice City, a new report has confirmed - but it is nothing to do with Rockstar&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto. 


Jackson set tongues wagging last week when he posted the familiar neon-pink logo for Rockstar&#x27;s Vice City on Instagram and cryptically claimed that &quot;this shit bigger than Power&quot; - a reference to his previous hit TV show. 


That post was later taken down by Jackson, and we now have official word via Deadline that the project simply shares a name with Rockstar&#x27;s much-loved GTA entry.

The game&#x27;s Island map has been radically changed via areas themed around ancient temples, as well as a huge neon city location. It&#x27;s here, in this latter area, you&#x27;ll be able to hop on grind rails to get about and shoot while on the move. It&#x27;s this season&#x27;s biggest new gameplay mechanic. 


But there&#x27;s plenty more in store - not least a floating island location which will rift into the sky mid-match.

The game&#x27;s upcoming Contagion Bundle will add 14 new ways for this to happen. Sorry Jacob!


As previously announced, The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Contagion Bundle will add a permadeath mode to the game when it releases on 14th March. It will also see the addition of the Watchtower Skin Collection.


In the meantime, if you are yet to experience all of the death animations that came with The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s launch, you can check out Zoe&#x27;s extensive video cataloguing them below. May I recommend finding a cushion to hide behind before hitting play.

Sunbreak originally released for PC and Switch last June, introducing a wealth of new content to Rise. There&#x27;s the challenging new Master Rank, the new Switch Skills Swap function - enabling players to register two attack loadouts for a quest - plus new area The Citadel.


The latter is a diverse new zone, featuring the likes of lush forests, icy mountains, foggy swampland, and a huge ruined castle as its centrepiece, and arrives alongside a new hub area in the form of bustling port town Elgado Outpost.

Known as the Chainsaw demo, it all kicks off near the beginning of Resident Evil 4, when Leon enters the game&#x27;s mysterious village. And yes, there will be a chainsaw involved. I don&#x27;t want to say I called it, but I totally called it.


In a rather bold move, Capcom has stated there will be no time limit on this demo and you can play it as many times as you like. Below is a little trailer for it all - enjoy!

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s remaster of Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective - the stunning 2011 paranormal puzzle adventure about possessing inanimate objects - finally has a release date and will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam on 30th June.


Ghost Trick, for those unfamiliar, was created by Ace Attorney designer Shu Takumi, and follows the adventures of the strikingly besuited Sissel, who is surprised to wake up as a spirit - and minus his memories - at the start of the game. 


Thankfully, though, while his memories might be missing, his newfound spirit form grants him new abilities, enabling him to possess inanimate objects around the various environments in order to influence events and progress to the next portion of the wonderfully engaging story.

                              <span>At this point, you might well feel like you&#x27;ve already watched a movie&#x27;s worth of trailer for Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming Mario film, but if your hunger remains unsated, the company has coughed up one last trailer ahead of its full release this April.


So far, we&#x27;ve been given a lovely intro to animation studio Illumination&#x27;s cheery interpretation of the Mushroom Kingdom, a giddy second trailer - complete with a roaring Rainbow Road Mario Kart ride - a full scene featuring some wonderfully reworked music, a cat fight, and finally, and perhaps most endearingly, an oddball faux plumbing commercial for the Mario Bros. 


This time around, though, for Nintendo&#x27;s last trailer before release, we get a little bit of everything and, it turns out, a LOT more Rainbow Road. There&#x27;s a caged Luigi (played by Charlie Day), a somewhat unhinged Star Sprite, Seth Rogan&#x27;s Donkey Kong getting the Fire Flower treatment, and a blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it tour of some iconic Mario locales.

As detailed on the PlayStation Blog, The Last of Us Part 1 will feature a full suite of adjustable graphics options on PC, enabling players to tinker with the likes of frame rate caps, texture quality, shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion in their quest for optimal performance.

There&#x27;s also 21:9 Ultrawide and 32:9 Super Ultrawide monitor support, and compatibility with various technologies, including AMD FSR 2.2, Nvidia DLSS Super Resolution, and 3D audio.

                              <span>Warner Bros. has reportedly delayed the launch of Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League once more, moving its release from May to sometime &quot;later this year&quot;.


Suicide Squad - a canonical follow-up to Rocksteady&#x27;s Batman Arkham Knight, playable solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - was announced in August 2021 and expected to release the following year. Last March, however, Warner Bros. made the decision to push its launch into &quot;spring&quot; 2023 to make &quot;the best game we can.&quot;


As this year got underway, Warner Bros. was finally ready to announce a 26th May release for Suicide Squad, but a new report from Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter, claims the publisher is now ditching that date in favour of a new launch &quot;later this year&quot;. Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden made similar claims, saying he was hearing Suicide Squad might be pushed back as far as &quot;Q4-ish&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting more on RoboCop: Rogue City since its announcement back in 2021, today&#x27;s your day. Publisher Nacon has released a new &quot;gameplay overview&quot; trailer and confirmed a launch delay from the previously announced June window into September.


This is Nacon&#x27;s second gameplay video for RoboCop: Rogue City, but given how little actual gameplay was included in the intial one, this latest is arguably the first time developer Teyon (which made the rather wonky Terminator: Resistance) has been able to give a real sense of how things will play out. And that appears to be a mix of first-person gunplay and detective work.


 In the video, we see RoboCop patrolling the rain-slicked streets of Old Detroit in search of a suspected drug trafficker. He&#x27;s able to profile ne&#x27;er-do-wells using his fancy gadgetry as he makes his way to the likely scene of the crime - an arcade - and once inside, there&#x27;s an opportunity to do a bit of scan-based detective work, where he uncovers evidence of drug use on the premises before bothering a potential informant at the urinal.

                              <span>Myst developer Cyan Worlds has given its steampunk VR puzzle adventure Firmament a release date, confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for PC and Mac on 18th May this year.


It&#x27;s been quite a wait for Firmament; Cyan Worlds initially announced the game - and released an evocative teaser trailer - all the way back in 2018, promising to take players on a &quot;resplendent, magical, journey&quot; across four diverse worlds, accompanied by an ever-present clockwork companion and a long-dead, ethereal mentor. 


One year later, Cyan launched a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the development of Firmament - which it calls a &quot;deeply immersive narrative adventure game that stays true to the concepts that made the adventure genre great&quot; - and now, following a number of delays (it was initially expected to arrive in 2020), a firm release date is finally here.

On Thursday, security firm Mandiant published a report that said threat actors with a suspected nexus to China were engaged in a campaign to maintain long-term persistence by running malware on unpatched SonicWall SMA appliances. The campaign was notable for the ability of the malware to remain on the devices even after its firmware received new firmware.
“The attackers put significant effort into the stability and persistence of their tooling,” Mandiant researchers Daniel Lee, Stephen Eckels, and Ben Read wrote. “This allows their access to the network to persist through firmware updates and maintain a foothold on the network through the SonicWall Device.”...</span>

In my previous article, Forensic container checkpointing in
Kubernetes, I introduced checkpointing in Kubernetes
and how it has to be setup and how it can be used. The name of the
feature is Forensic container checkpointing, but I did not go into
any details how to do the actual analysis of the checkpoint created by
Kubernetes. In this article I want to provide details how the
checkpoint can be analyzed.
Checkpointing is still an alpha feature in Kubernetes and this article
wants to provide a preview how the feature might work in the future.
Preparation
Details about how to configure Kubernetes and the underlying CRI implementation
to enable checkpointing support can be found in my Forensic container
checkpointing in Kubernetes article.

Now, as part of its ongoing campaign to win over the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Microsoft has run full-page Call of Duty ads in both the Daily Mail and the Financial Times. 


The ad (spotted by The Verge) leans into Microsoft&#x27;s recent deals with Nintendo and Nvidia, stating that should the Activision Blizzard deal go through, it will bring Call of Duty to 150 million more players.

The new species is native to Singapore, and its discovery was reported on by Singapore broadsheet The Straits Times. 
The cockroach was first observed in 2016, when it was collected in a survey at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. After dissecting some specimens and comparing them to known species of cockroaches, the cockroach has been determined to be a new species never recorded before.

Taking a cue from Theme Hospital, Galacticare is a sci-fi hospital management game set in space, with weird aliens and even weirder afflictions.


It&#x27;s due out on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and GOG later this year. Check out the trailer below, just beware there&#x27;s a lot of sick!

Finally, a release date! But later in the year than we&#x27;d hoped for!

Whilst Starfield director Todd Howard talked in front of the camera for the announcement video, what we all really wanted a peek at was the screen lead producer Tim Lamb was using to play the game in the background. Throughout the video, we got brief glimpses at other developers playing and testing Starfield, so you can bet we got our magnifying glasses out to see what details we could spot.

                              <span>Ironmace, the Korean developer behind upcoming mediaeval looter Dark and Darker, has had its office searched after allegations the studio created its game with stolen code.


These accusations were made by Nexon, another Korean developer and one which several Ironmace employees used to work for.


Reportedly, certain members of Ironmace&#x27;s team were &quot;disciplinarily fired from Nexon&quot;, with Nexon claiming they are now &quot;making games using materials and assets they worked on during their time at Nexon&quot; (via This Is Game/Google Translate).

                              <span>Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is the latest game from Square Enix.

The game made its debut announcement at last month&#x27;s Nintendo Direct  (though only in Japan), and to promote its release Square Enix has shared more details on the game&#x27;s setting and characters.

We already know the game is set in the late 20th century and was developed alongside tourist organisations for Sumida, Tokyo. The game&#x27;s four protagonists have been afflicted by curses, which we now know are related to a set of real urban legends called The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. Aha, I see what you did there, Square.

However, ahead of this showcase, several Twitch streamers have noticed an ad for the Resident Evil 4 remake&#x27;s demo, which ends with the words &quot;demo available now&quot;.

Previously, the disc and digital versions of a game were considered separate entities but this has been unified in the latest update.
Now, you can play the digital version of a game installed on your PS5 by inserting the disc, without having to install the disc version. This also works for any digital games other users sharing your PS5 have installed, which you have the disc for.

Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, as the prequel is officially known, follows the fairytale-inspired adventures of Cereza - the child version of adult Bayonetta introduced in the series&#x27; first game - and her demonic companion Cheshire.

 
The pair embark on a genteel action-adventure rendered in the style of an illustrated storybook, in which players do a spot of platforming, solve puzzles, and occasionally battle creatures across the perilous Avalon Forest - using the left stick to control Cereza and wield her magic and the right to unleash Cheshire&#x27;s might.

                              <span>Wargroove, developer Chucklefish&#x27;s Advance-Wars-inspired turn-based strategy game, is getting a sequel, and it&#x27;s coming to PC and Switch at some currently unspecified future time.


The original Wargroove released back in 2019, giving starved Advance Wars fans a solidly entertaining, gorgeously presented slab of turn-based strategy action - featuring a few new tactical twists, such as unit synergies - with a splash of Fire Emblem fantasy thrown in.


A free (and sizeable) co-op-focused expansion, Double Trouble, launched in 2020, and now, a little over three years later, Chucklefish has revealed a follow-up is on the way.

                              <span>Microsoft has told the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) it&#x27;s confident Activision Blizzard can optimise Call of Duty to run on Switch after the regulatory body raised concerns around the console&#x27;s &quot;technical limitations&quot;.


As part of its ongoing efforts to convince regulatory bodies in the UK, EU, and US to approve its $69BN USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard - which has so far been blighted by concerns it may choose to make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox, hampering PlayStation&#x27;s ability to compete - Microsoft signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo guaranteeing it would bring the FPS to Switch.


However, in its Provisional findings report published last month, the CMA said it was unable to place &quot;material weight&quot; on Microsoft&#x27;s agreement when considering the proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, as there was &quot;no certainty [the deal would] lead to CoD becoming available on Nintendo&quot;. Elaborating further, it highlighted the &quot;technical limitations&quot; that &quot;would need to be overcome for Call of Duty to become available for Nintendo Switch.&quot;

                              <span>UPDATE 6.14pm: Microsoft has responded to Sony&#x27;s suggestion it could deliberately introduces bugs and errors into Call of Duty to make it unplayable on PlayStation, reiterating it has made a &quot;guarantee of parity between Xbox and PlayStation on access to Call of Duty&quot;.


In a statement provided to Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson said, &quot;Since the CMA issued its Provisional Findings, we have offered solutions which address its concerns and increase the deal&#x27;s benefits to UK players and game developers. These include a guarantee of parity between Xbox and PlayStation on access to Call of Duty and legally binding commitments to ensure that Call of Duty is available to at least 150 million more players on other consoles and cloud streaming platforms once the deal closes.&quot;


Referencing its proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard more generally, Microsoft added, &quot;The decision now lies with the CMA on whether it will block this deal and protect Sony, the dominant market leader, or consider solutions that make more games available to more players.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has announced it&#x27;ll be holding this year&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase on 11th June.


That isn&#x27;t, of course, particularly surprising news; Microsoft has long favoured the pre-E3 Sunday slot for its big announcements showcase, and it&#x27;s one it&#x27;s clinging onto even after reports it won&#x27;t be participating in this year&#x27;s E3.


As to the specifics of its showcase, Microsoft isn&#x27;t saying much right now, only that it&#x27;ll run ahead of a special Starfield-focused Direct at some currently unspecified time.

                              <span>Another DLC for Two Point Campus is inbound, and this time the game is getting into the spooky spirit by throwing a load of ghosts our way. 


The aptly named School Spirits DLC will see Two Point Campus&#x27; students &quot;whisked off&quot; to Lifeless Estate, where &quot;the lawn may be lacklustre, and the surfaces strangely gooey, but all of the problems come back to the ghosts&quot;.   


Here, students will be able to take part in two new courses and encounter &quot;spirited new student archetypes&quot;. There will also be a spooky assortment of new items to fill your campus with. How fa-boo-lous!

Revealed at last year&#x27;s Wholesome Direct for PC, Tasmanian developer Webbysoft has today announced the game will also be released across PlayStation consoles and Nintendo Switch, with a release date of late 2023.


If you&#x27;re into adventure games with puzzles, pirates, and pups, this could well be one to look out for.

Starfield was initially due to release last November, but, in May, Bethesda announced it was delaying the game&#x27;s launch into the &quot;first half of 2023&quot; to &quot;ensure that [players] receive the best, most polished&quot; version.


Now, though, with rumours of a further delay continuing to swell around the internet, Bethesda has confirmed Starfield will now arrive in the second half of 2023, on 6th September.

On the monetisation front, Ironmace has promised there will be &quot;absolutely no&quot; pay-to-win elements included within the game, and its model will be one that &quot;players can understand&quot;.

                              <span>Metal: Hellsinger - the gleefully boisterous rhythm shooter from developer The Outsiders - is getting its first paid DLC expansion, titled Dream of the Beast, on 29th March.


Dream of the Beast adds two new original songs to Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s stellar music line-up, alongside a new weapon and three new outfits (Angel Eyes, Morning Star, and Dark Devotee), each with their own unique gameplay modifiers. 


On the song front, The Outsiders have signed up Lacuna Coil&#x27;s Cristina Scabbia and Lorna Shore&#x27;s Will Ramos to provide vocals for the new compositions which, as with Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s other tracks, have been written by Two Feathers.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher Take-Two has confirmed reports of layoffs at the company, calling the job losses &quot;necessary steps&quot; as it seeks to &quot;position the company for another extended period success.&quot;


Reports of layoffs at Take-Two first surfaced via Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who claimed the move would impact employees at Take-Two&#x27;s Private Division - the publishing label behind the likes of OlliOlli World and Kerbal Space Program - and other unspecified parts of the company.


Take-Two acknowledged it had laid off staff - but did not confirm affected divisions or the number of employees impacted - in a statement provided to PC Gamer, saying it had made &quot;targeted reductions in our US teams, primarily in corporate operations and label publishing&quot; that would have an &quot;minimal&quot; impact on its US development studios.

Officially, Microsoft is calling this latest controller release Velocity Green, which joins a line-up of other flat-colour variants including Pulse Red, Deep Pink, and Electric Volt.


Feature-wise, it&#x27;s exactly as you&#x27;d expect from an Xbox controller, with textured grip for bumpers, triggers, and rear, along with a &quot;hybrid&quot; D-pad, Share button, and 3.5mm jack.

Lince Works was founded in 2014 and released its debut title, Aragami&#x27;s first instalment, two years later. It proved successful enough that a sequel arrived in 2021, and the studio revealed it had started focusing on &quot;brand-new adventures&quot; in September last year.


Now, however, in a message shared on Twitter, Lince Works has announced it will &quot;effectively stop the development of new projects indefinitely, starting this April.&quot;

&quot;Our team has been hard at work making Peridots real,&quot; creative director David Hollin explained in a blog post announcing today&#x27;s release date news. &quot;They are immersive, amazing magical creatures that eat, sleep, play with toys, explore their environment, get bored, develop unique personalities, and are always in need of a loving adopter like you.&quot;

Catalog, which Playdate creator Panic describes as a &quot;boutique digital on-device and web based storefront&quot;, arrives today and marks something of a departure for the company, which has so far only distributed Playdate games through a seasonal release model.


With the arrival of Catalog, however, players can purchase individual titles on-demand either directly from their Playdate or via the Catalog website. 16 games and apps will be available at launch - 11 of which are brand-new - and Panic says it&#x27;ll be expanding the curated selection over time. It also assures owners it&#x27;ll remain possible to sideload and purchase Playdate games and apps from other storefronts such as Itch.io and Gumroad.

Dubbed BlackLotus, the malware is what’s known as a UEFI bootkit. These sophisticated pieces of malware target the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the low-level and complex chain of firmware responsible for booting up virtually every modern computer. As the mechanism that bridges a PC’s device firmware with its operating system, the UEFI is an OS in its own right. It’s located in an ...</span>

                              <span>Twitch has addressed the livestreaming of explicit deepfake content on its platform in a new safety blog post.



It follows an incident in January in which explicit fake content of female streamers was live streamed on Twitch. 


&quot;This moment caused immense distress to those whose images were used without their consent, and set off a wave of conversations about the dangers that AI-generated explicit imagery can pose,&quot; reads the blog post from Twitch.

That&#x27;s based on physical retail sales, per data from GfK courtesy of the Entertainment Retailer&#x27;s Association Yearbook (thanks GamesIndustry.biz). For digital downloads, the average selling price was £15.19, a rise of 7.3 percent over last year (from data firm Omdia).



Since 2017, the average selling price of games has risen by 12 percent.

However, not content with just booting the offending parties out of their games, the Escape from Tarkov team has taken things one step further and compiled a spreadsheet of all the cheaters it has booted out. It has then shared this document with the public (if you want to scroll through it for yourself, here it is).


As reported by TechCrunch (via PC Gamer), Battlestate Games said it recently banned 6700 cheaters and added all of their nicknames to this document.

                              <span>Microsoft has promised more &quot;consistency&quot; with Halo Infinite seasonal updates, as its third season launches today.


As shared on Xbox Wire, 343 Industries&#x27; head of live performance Sean Baron discussed the future of seasonal updates.



&quot;In our preview of Season 3, I said that this is the beginning of what seasonality is for Halo Infinite. But &#x27;seasonality&#x27; is restrictive. To me, seasonality is really about consistency - we need to be consistent in everything. I feel very confident with where we&#x27;ve gone with Season 3, and I have very strong confidence that we&#x27;re going to be able to keep improving that consistency, and avoid, completely, the long seasons of the past,&quot; he said.

                              <span>The Resident Evil 4 remake is set to release in just a few short weeks (24th March, to be precise). Ahead of this launch, a mysterious new ARG website has appeared online. 


An ARG is an augmented reality game, and this one in particular covers the events just before Resident Evil 4 begins. It serves as a little bite size prequel, if you will. 


Known as &quot;Baby Eagle Is Missing&quot;, this ARG tasks players with solving a handful of puzzles that will help locate the US President&#x27;s daughter, Ashley Graham (who is codenamed &quot;Baby Eagle&quot;).

                              <span>Rovio could reverse its decision to de-list Angry Birds from the Google Play store.


At the end of February, the mobile publisher removed the original Angry Birds game from the store due to its business &quot;impact&quot; on the publisher&#x27;s other games. On iOS, the game was renamed to Red&#x27;s First Flight.


Now, in a statement to Axios from a senior executive at the publisher, Rovio could reverse its decision to remove the game - or if the change is successful it could remove it from iOS too.

                              <span>There was a bit of confusion last week, when it was announced that The Super Mario Bros. Movie would be released two days earlier than previously expected in the US and &quot;60 other markets&quot;. At this point, it was unclear whether the UK fell into the &quot;other markets&quot; category.


Now, however, Universal has cleared that up, and stated The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be released on 5th April in the UK. This is the same as in the US.


If you&#x27;ve been struggling to keep track of when The Super Mario Bros. Movie is due to arrive, you are not alone. After all, Universal has shunted its release date around the calendar on numerous occasions.

                              <span>A bug in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is causing players to lose their save files, thanks to the latest patch.


It&#x27;s unclear exactly what the cause is, but many fans on reddit (thanks Kotaku) are reporting the error after connecting to the Pokémon Go app or downloading the DLC.


The reddit thread is full of players losing hundreds of hours of gameplay and shiny Pokémon, some from merely purchasing the DLC.

As reported by HBO, episode eight was watched by 8.1 million viewers on its debut across &quot;HBO Max and linear telecasts&quot;.


For those keeping track, that is a 74 percent increase from the show&#x27;s pilot episode.

The CMA has been sceptical about Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn bid to purchase Activision Blizzard, most recently stating it could harm UK gamers, resulting in &quot;higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation&quot;. It believes players would abandon PlayStation for Xbox.



However, based on a YouGov survey commissioned by Microsoft back in January and shared with Axios, just three percent of all PlayStation users would switch to Xbox if Call of Duty became exclusive.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is - can you believe it? - five years old this month, and to celebrate its half-decade anniversary, developer Rare is ushering in a new quality-of-life-focused season all about reinvigorating the piratical multiplayer adventure&#x27;s core sandbox.


Sea of Thieves&#x27; Season 9 - which launches next Thursday, 16th March, just ahead of the game&#x27;s 20th March anniversary - is somewhat unusual in that it isn&#x27;t really built around one single flagship new feature. Instead, it&#x27;s tweaking, finessing, and refreshing the game as a whole in a bid to create a more coherent, enjoyable experience after five years of disparate updates.


For starters, come the new update, all World Events - from ship battles to Ashen Lords - will dynamically scale to match different crew sizes. Additionally, emergent event - the kraken, megaladon, fog, and ship wrecks - have been adjusted to make them a more common occurrence after having all become increasingly seldom seen as updates have continued.

                              <span>As part of today&#x27;s announcement showcase, Paradox has teased Life By You, a new game from former head of Sims and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs, Rod Humble.


Little has been shared about Life By You beyond a brief teaser trailer, but it&#x27;s being developed by Paradox Tectonic, the Humble-run studio unveiled back in 2019.


At the time of Paradox Tectonic&#x27;s establishment, Humble said the studio would focus on creating &quot;open, fun, beautiful games which respect the players&#x27; intelligence and enables their creativity, freedom, emotion, and sharing&quot;, and we&#x27;ve now got our first look - albeit brief - of what the team has been working on since then.

                              <span>As part of today&#x27;s announcement bonanza, Paradox Interactive has officially unveiled its long-awaited city builder sequel Cities: Skylines 2, which is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 at some point &quot;later this year&quot;.


Cities: Skylines 2 is being developed by Colossal Order and promises a &quot;revolutionary&quot; spin on the studio&#x27;s acclaimed 2015 original, giving players the tools to &quot;build any kind of city they can imagine and follow its growth from a humble village to a bustling metropolis&quot;.


How Cities: Skylines 2 will differ from its predecessor in more specific terms, beyond a shiny new facade, is currently unclear, but Paradox says the game - which it calls the &quot;most open-ended city-building sandbox on the planet&quot; - will enable players to &quot;create and maintain cities that come to life like never before.&quot;

                              <span>Acclaimed grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is nipping outside for a bit of excitement in its next major expansion, Tours and Tournaments, which launches this spring.


As its name suggests, Tours and Tournaments has something of a focus on outdoor pursuits, and will, for intsance, let players host grand demonstrations of feats of arms around the map - an activity that&#x27;ll attract nearby nobles and wandering knights, and potentially boost social standing or military prowess along the way.


Players&#x27; best knights can also be honoured with special titles and accolades that grant bonuses to both them and the armies they lead.

As part of a recent Discord Q&amp;A, which was subsequently shared on Steam, the developer was asked if Redfall would support crossplay between Steam and its Game Pass version. 


The answer was a yes. &quot;You&#x27;ll definitely be able to play with your friends on Steam,&quot; Arkane replied.

                              <span>Harebrained Schemes, the studio behind the acclaimed likes of Shadowrun and Battletech, has announced The Lamplighters League, a pulp-inspired tactical turn-based strategy game heading to PC and Xbox Series X/S in 2023.


The Lamplighters League - or rather, The Lamplighters League and the Tower at the End of the World to give it its full name - is described as a original pulp adventure set in an alternate 1930s. It&#x27;ll pit players against a nefarious global cult, the Banished Court, out for global domination.


&quot;For millennia,&quot; Harebrained explains, &quot;all that stood between this sinister cabal and their plans was a band of heroic scholars known as the Lamplighters League. Unfortunately, the best of the best are all gone, so now it&#x27;s up to the best of the worst.&quot;

                              <span>This is a good survey on prompt injection attacks on large language models (like ChatGPT).
Abstract: We are currently witnessing dramatic advances in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). They are already being adopted in practice and integrated into many systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and search engines. The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting. Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed filtering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following. So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM...</span>

                              <span>Kerbal Space Program 2 has had a rocky launch. 


On the space-flight simulator&#x27;s release in Early Access, many found the game unplayable due to a collection of bugs and frame-rate issues. At this time, many reviewers on Steam suggested players stick to the original Kerbal Space Program game until the developer irons out some of the kinks plaguing its sequel. 


And, well, it looks like many are doing just that, with Kerbal Space Program 2&#x27;s player count already dropping below its predecessor&#x27;s numbers in recent days.

After last week&#x27;s episode further established Ellie&#x27;s motivations, episode eight - &quot;When We Are In Need&quot; - brings us back to the present day, and Joel and Ellie&#x27;s ongoing plight to find the Fireflies. 


This episode stays remarkably faithful to its source material while continuing to put a spotlight on character development, and as always leaves plenty to discuss. Without further ado, let&#x27;s crack on.

We already knew that Dredge, the sinister fishing game from Black Salt Games and publisher Team 17, is out on 30th March 2023, but Black Salt Games has also detailed what&#x27;s available in the game&#x27;s various editions, too.

There are several different versions to consider, although the pricing structure is a touch convoluted – here&#x27;s how it breaks down…

                              <span>Get set, Counter-Strike fans – it looks like a new version of CS:GO – possibly called Counter-Strike 2 – could be on the way.

As there&#x27;s been no formal word from Valve, Steam, or anyone else for that matter, all we can do right now is chalk this up to either a mistake, a hoax, or a hilarious misunderstanding. If a recent NVIDIA leak is correct, however, and executable files called &quot;cs2&quot; and &quot;csgo2&quot; have indeed been discovered, a beta could launch as soon as later this month. 

Alongside a curious tweet from noted Counter-Strike leaker @gabefollower, which unveiled the curious additions to the NVIDIA driver update, journalist Richard Lewis has also stepped up to confirm that &quot;a new version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive [is] on its way&quot; and reckons it is &quot;almost certainly set to be released under the working title of Counter-Strike 2&quot;.

                              <span>Last week the Biden Administration released a new National Cybersecurity Strategy (summary &gt;here. There is lots of good commentary out there. It’s basically a smart strategy, but the hard parts are always the implementation details. It’s one thing to say that we need to secure our cloud infrastructure, and another to detail what the means technically, who pays for it, and who verifies that it’s been done.
One of the provisions getting the most attention is a move to shift liability to software vendors, something I’ve been advocating for since at least 2003...</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has been ordered to refund Austrian FIFA players after a court ruled that FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) packs are a form of gambling.

As reported by Games Wirtschaft and spotted by VGC, a court in Hermagor ruled that the football game&#x27;s FUT packs violated the country&#x27;s gambling laws. 

According to lawyer Ulrich Salburg, the plaintiffs - which include one minor - had allegedly &quot;gambled away&quot; hundreds of euros on FUT packs when the uncertain monetary value of the packs purportedly violated the Austrian Gaming Act. Consequently, the court alleged that the controversial loot boxes could be classified as &quot;illegal gambling&quot;.

                              <span>Konami wants you to know that its reimagined PES football game, eFootball 2023, has now surpassed 600 million downloads globally across both PC, mobile, and console.

The free-to-play football game is celebrating the milestone by offering a &quot;commemorative campaign&quot;, as well as giving away Neymar Jr and some in-game currency to anyone who logs in between now and 30th March.

Log in every day, however, and you can receive up to 10 coins a day, up to a total of 280 eFootball coins. Score a goal with Neymar Jr in the next fortnight – from now until 16th March – and you&#x27;ll get more coins, Game Points, and XP, and the same applies if you score with Lionel Messi between 16th and 30th March.

According to a Reddit Q&amp;A session as spotted and transcribed by PC Gamer, the team has &quot;big plans&quot; for Kelvin, including expanding the tasks he can complete - including fortifying the base. Endnight also intends to develop Virginia&#x27;s AI so that she&#x27;ll take on intruders with &quot;more bravery&quot; if you were altruistic enough to hand over one of your firearms.

&quot;We have big plans to keep adding tasks Kelvin can complete, some ideas in progress are having are having him help construct a wall around your base, or fortify/repair the base when needed,&quot; the team said.

That&#x27;s right; if you&#x27;re looking for more branded kitchen merchandise to go alongside your neon-green Xbox Series X mini-fridge, images of a &quot;Series S Toaster&quot; have appeared on a French website.  

As spotted by GyoJvbfr and XboxSquad.fr (thanks, Windows Central), it looks as though the toaster is set to release later this year, but is currently available to pre-order for residents of France and Belgium.

                              <span>Rumour has it, a first-person mode is on the way to Fortnite.

That&#x27;s according to Fortnite dataminer Hypex, who – along with other leakers like ShiinaBR, GMatrixGames, and iFireMonkey – believes Fortnite&#x27;s first-person mode is set to arrive with the battle royale&#x27;s &quot;next season&quot;.

As many Fortnite fans will know, Hypex is neither new to, nor unknown in, the community, and has often been proved right about other similar unannounced claims in the past.

                              <span>Ubisoft is reportedly &quot;working on a strategic reorganisation of its European business subsidiaries&quot; that may include shuttering some of its European offices.

Unsubstantiated reports first surfaced on ResetEra, where a poster shared part of an email that purportedly detailed plans to &quot;close a number of subsidiaries&quot;, including the closure of Ubisoft Benelux. 

Eurogamer understands this reorganisation relates to Ubisoft&#x27;s business offices rather than game development studios. In a statement to NME, Ubisoft refused to &quot;share&quot; any more details given that the &quot;process is ongoing&quot;, but did say: &quot;Ubisoft’s publishing group is working on a strategic reorganisation of its European business subsidiaries&quot;.

                              <span>Less than a year after Meta ramped the price of its Meta Quest 2 VR headset up by $100, the company is slashing prices back down - albeit only on the 256GB model and only by $70 - starting this Sunday, 5th March. It&#x27;s also discounted its pricey Meta Quest Pro by $500.


At the time of last year&#x27;s price hike, Meta insisted the increase was necessary as &quot;the costs to make and ship our products [have] been on the rise&quot;. Now, though, it&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s dropping the price of Meta Quest 2&#x27;s 256GB model from $499.99 USD to $429.99 in order to &quot;let even more people feel the joy of fully immersive games and experiences&quot;.


The price drop goes into effect this Sunday in a select number of territories - specifically, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, and the US - and will mean there&#x27;s now only $40 price difference between the 128GB and 256GB models. Meta hasn&#x27;t shared the updated prices in local currencies as yet.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s ambitious The Duviri Paradox expansion - which was originally slated to arrive last year before getting delayed into 2023 - is finally almost upon us, with developer Digital Extremes having now confirmed it&#x27;ll be launching this April. And while you&#x27;ve got your diary out, it&#x27;s also announced a date for this year&#x27;s TennoCon so you might as well jot that down too.


The Duviri Paradox, if you&#x27;ve not been keeping up with the news, introduces Warframe&#x27;s fourth open-world area - following the Plains of Eidolon, Orb Vallis, and the Cambrian Drift - and plunges players into the fantasy-western-themed world of Duviri, most notable for the fact it exists inside the mind of the expansion&#x27;s new big bad, Dominus Thrax.


Beyond its distinctive setting, The Duviri Paradox also features a striking stark black and white aesthetic (with the world slowly blooming into full colour over time), a new rewind-on-death mechanic that sees Digital Extremes &quot;flirting with rogue-like elements&quot;, and, for good measure, a fancy skeletal horse steed.

                              <span>If you had high hopes of hunkering down for a spot of Wii U Mario Kart 8 or Splatoon multiplayer this weekend, there&#x27;s some bad news: Nintendo has pulled both games offline while it addresses a security vulnerability, with no hint as to when servers may return.


Nintendo took both games offline at 4.30am this morning in the UK, and confirmed the downtime on its server status page, explaining, &quot;This network service is currently unavailable due to urgent maintenance required to fix a vulnerability related to online play.&quot;


As noted by VGC, Nintendo dataminer OatmealDome has suggested the security issue affecting Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon is likely to be ENLBufferPwn - a vulnerability common to network code present in a number of first-party Nintendo games that makes it possible for a hacker to connect to another player&#x27;s device and remotely execute code.

                              <span>Team Ninja has released a statement addressing issues PC players are facing with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.
The hotly-anticipated action game released earlier today and had garnered plenty of interest with its demo. Alan Wen gave the game a recommended badge in his review on PlayStation 5, but performance on PC seems to be hit-and-miss.
At time of writing, Wo Long is in the top five best-sellers on Steam. The game peaked at 75,906 concurrent players on the platform earlier today (as recorded by SteamDB), making it one of Team Ninja&#x27;s most popular games on PC.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a new first-person mod for the original Dead Space, which raises the classic sci-fi survival horror&#x27;s scares to a whole new level. 


When I initially saw this mod, I questioned its value. Dead Space has one of the cleanest HUDs of any game, and its ability to view Isaac Clarke&#x27;s health and Stasis module via the back of his suit remains inspired.


That said, a first-person view - where you are unable to see enemies approach from behind and have to mentally keep track of damage - is surely even scarier.

                              <span>With the release of The Super Mario Bros. movie approaching, the film&#x27;s cast have been doing the rounds to promote it, as one would expect.


Jack Black, the voice of Bowser, may have promoted a little more than he had anticipated in a recent appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show - and ended up having his crotch blurred.


Black appeared with co-stars Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, and Keegan Michael-Key in a series of videos uploaded to YouTube by the official channel for The Kelly Clarkson Show. The others showed up in smart casual fashion, whilst Black was &quot;tricked&quot; by the others into dressing up as his Mario movie counterpart.

BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle, another fighting game from the same developer (Arc System Works), was also announced for Game Pass in September, but we still don&#x27;t know when that&#x27;ll be available on the service.

As with all GBA games, you&#x27;ll need to be a subscriber of the Nintendo Switch Online service&#x27;s pricier Expansion Pack tier to be able to play it.


Developed internally by Nintendo, Metroid Fusion is beloved for its classic side-scrolling Metroid gameplay. Upon its launch back in 2007, Eurogamer&#x27;s editor at the time Tom Bramwell described it as his &quot;favourite 2D Metroid yet&quot;.

Matsuda has served as CEO for decade, during which time the company has seen a mix of fortunes. Square Enix&#x27;s western studios have been sold off, its high-profile Marvel&#x27;s Avengers project failed to find success, and most recently its Japan-made blockbuster Forspoken flopped.


The company has lined up Takashi Kiryu, a young exec who joined Square Enix in 2020, as Matsuda&#x27;s replacement.

Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope was well-recieved by critics when it launched at the end of last year, drawing praise for a solid evolution of its wonderfully engaging 2017 predecessor, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, that melded exemplary XCOM-like strategy action with expanded puzzles and more open-ended exploration.


Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan liked Sparks of Hope enough to slap it with a Recommended badge in his review, calling it &quot;knockabout XCOM fun in a galaxy-hopping adventure&quot;.

Mojang says it&#x27;s chosen the name as it &quot;represents the journey that Minecraft takes us on, and the unique stories that each of us bring back&quot;, and because its additions are all about &quot;self expression through representation, story telling, and world building.&quot;


But while Trails &amp; Tales&#x27; name might be new, details of the features it&#x27;ll bring are not, with Mojang having already delved into the update&#x27;s various additions in some significant detail.

                              <span>Long-in-the-works open-world zombie shooter Dead Island 2 is finally - after eight years and multiple delays - almost upon us, and in anticipation of its 21st April arrival, publisher Deep Silver has just shared 14 new minutes of combat-focused gameplay.


This latest airing follows Dead Island 2&#x27;s slightly odd showcase in December - which buried a few juicy snippets of gameplay amid a heap of largely uninformative live-action sequences - but the focus this time is on gameplay from beginning to end.


Deep Silver&#x27;s latest gameplay reveal picks up in Bel Air, just a few hours into the game, as players - having selected Dani as their Slayer of choice - attempt to navigate LA&#x27;s sun-kissed (and zombie-infested) streets in search of the Halperin Hotel evacuation point.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a little something for purveyors of exquisite things at reasonable prices: Call of the Sea, developer Out of the Blue&#x27;s acclaimed Lovecraft-hued tropical island mystery adventure, is free next week on the Epic Games Store.


Call of the Sea - which originally released toward the tail-end of 2020 - whisks players back to 1934, as protagonist Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One&#x27;s Cissy Jones) investigates a beautiful South Pacific island in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a captivating, often ingenious blend of story, exploration, and puzzling that successfully that manages to hits some powerful emotional beats, even as it tips into cosmic weirdness. Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese described Call of the Sea as a &quot;dazzlingly different debut with a haunting sense of place and adventure&quot; in his Recommended review.

                              <span>Blumhouse - the horror-focused movie production company behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, and Get Out - is adapting Dead by Daylight into a film.


The project is being developed in conjunction with Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour Interactive and Atomic Monster (the production company run by prominent horror director James Wan), with the latter calling the game&#x27;s &quot;incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains...perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation&quot;.


There&#x27;s no writer or director attached to the adaptation yet - the companies are &quot;commencing their search&quot; for both - but Blumhouse says it&#x27;s &quot;imperative we find someone who appreciates and loves the world as much as we do, to help us bring the game to the big screen&quot;.

                              <span>Nicholas Weaver wrote an excellent paper on the problems of cryptocurrencies and the need to regulate the space—with all existing regulations. His conclusion:
Regulators, especially regulators in the United States, often fear accusations of stifling innovation. As such, the cryptocurrency space has grown over the past decade with very little regulatory oversight.
But fortunately for regulators, there is no actual innovation to stifle. Cryptocurrencies cannot revolutionize payments or finance, as the basic nature of all cryptocurrencies render them fundamentally unsuitable to revolutionize our financial system—which, by the way, already has decades of successful experience with digital payments and electronic money. The supposedly “decentralized” and “trustless” cryptocurrency systems, both technically and socially, fail to provide meaningful benefits to society—and indeed, necessarily also fail in their foundational claims of decentralization and trustlessness...</span>

Citing sources familiar with the deal, the report claims that Microsoft has won over the European Commission with its show of concessions last week, when it announced deals to ensure Call of Duty would be made available on Nintendo platforms and Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce Now streaming service.


The EU is set to publicly state its final judgement on the case before 25th April.

                              <span>Frontier Developments is making its F1 racing management sim - the aptly F1 Manager 2022 - free to try this weekend on Steam.


F1 Manager 2022 - the first of four games planned for release under Frontier&#x27;s F1 licensing deal - launched last August, putting players in the role of a team principal and challenging them to lead their &quot;drivers, engineers and fans to glory in the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Drivers&#x27; World Championship and FIA Formula 1 Constructors&#x27; World Championship&quot;.


While it adequately filled enough of a niche to draw a positive response at launch, players quickly began to criticise the game for its shallow, undercooked features and a significant number of bugs - but any hopes of major improvement were quickly quashed when Frontier announced it was ending support for the game less than two months after launch.

                              <span>Yuji Naka, the former boss of Sega&#x27;s Sonic Team, has reportedly admitted a charge of insider trading over the ownership of shares worth around £865k.


In December last year, Naka was accused of violating financial laws after it was reported that he had purchased a large number of shares in Japanese mobile developer ATeam while employed at Square Enix.


It was alleged that Naka had done so in the knowledge ATeam was working with Square Enix on mobile game Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier - a fact which had not been made public.

The presentation, which was shared with The Verge, contained details on Quest 3 as well as two more headsets and Meta&#x27;s AR development projects.


Speculation of a Quest 3 release sometime soon was fuelled recently by the news that Meta is ending support for its original Quest VR headset, with the company continuing to deliver security patches until 2024.

Lempel described James as a &quot;natural fit&quot; for PlayStation Playmakers, and recalled James&#x27; appearance with his son Bronny in that one God of War trailer with Ben Stiller as Kratos.

                              <span>Microsoft has successfully won access to a trove of internal Sony documentation pertinent to its Activision Blizzard deal - something the PlayStation maker was fiercely opposed to. 


Sony has emerged as the acquisition&#x27;s key opponent, and Microsoft is hoping this ruling will allow it to gain leverage with the US regulator ahead of its own judgement. 


A judge has now ruled that  Microsoft can view Sony&#x27;s communications with regulators about the Activision deal, as well as details of Sony&#x27;s own exclusivity agreements with game publishers since 2019.

Survivor will follow on from 2019&#x27;s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, continuing Cal&#x27;s adventures - now with a beard.


The sequel was discussed before the release of the first game and, should it perform well, a third game would be likely, Asmussen told IGN.

                              <span>Telltale Games has delayed The Wolf Among Us 2 out of its 2023 launch window and into 2024, in order to avoid burnout and crunch at the studio.


The Wolf Among Us 2 - the sequel to Telltale&#x27;s acclaimed 2013 narrative adventure based on Bill Willingham&#x27;s Fables comic books - has had an eventful development. It was first announced in 2017, but progress halted after the studio shut its doors the following year. It was then unexpectedly re-announced in 2019, after Telltale was resurrected under new management.


This new version - which is being co-developed by AdHoc Studio, co-founded by original Wolf Among Us co-director Nick Herman, and made up of almost 50-percent former Telltale employees - was initially expected to launch in 2023, but Telltale has now pushed the game&#x27;s release into next year, as detailed in a statement shared on Twitter.

                              <span>Developer Sloclap&#x27;s acclaimed martial arts adventure Sifu will - after a year of PlayStation and Epic Games Store exclusivity - be making its way to Xbox and Steam on 28th March.


Sifu, if you&#x27;ve not yet had the pleasure, is a third-person, single-player action game - focused on intense hand-to-hand combat - that charts a young Kung Fu student&#x27;s quest for revenge following the murder of his family. It also features a magic pendant capable of resurrecting the protagonist on defeat, but he&#x27;ll grow older with each revival, making its uses finite - but at least you get to keep any unlocked skills for another attempt.


Sifu was extremely well-received when it launched last February, but some players found its extremely tough challenge a little too much to handle. Pleasingly, though, Sloclap took feedback on board and added new difficulty options several months in - and has continued updating the experience with new modifiers, systems, and outfits since.

Once today&#x27;s update is downloaded and installed, players can pause the action as required and summon in protagonist Chai and friends ready for their close-up (or otherwise). All characters can be posed, and the photo mode also features a choice of frames, filters, and camera effects to memorialise the moment in style.


Alongside the new photo mode, today&#x27;s Hi-Fi Rush update also brings a number of fixes and tweaks, including stick and trigger dead zone adjustments, attack behaviour changes for the game&#x27;s first boss, and more, as detailed in Tango Gameworks&#x27; patch notes.

                              <span>New job listings posted by Gears of War studio The Coalition indicate the developer is in the process of ramping up production on a new title in the long-running shooter series.


That the studio specifically set up to make new Gears games might be working on a new Gears game isn&#x27;t news in itself, of course, but The Coalition has been pretty quiet since its last major release, Gears 5 in 2019. It had a hand in 2020&#x27;s Gears Tactics and The Matrix Awakens in 2021, but there&#x27;s been scant word of any major new Gears projects from the studio in that time.


First hints that Gears 6 might finally be on the way came from Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb in February, who claimed The Coalition had ditched two unannounced projects amid Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox layoffs to focus on a new entry in the flagship series - and now, new job listings posted on The Coalition&#x27;s website lend credence to that report.

                              <span>Microsoft has designed a custom set of Xbox Series X and S consoles, themed around The Mandalorian. 


Baby Yoda/Grogu features on the dinkier Xbox Series S design, while the beefier Xbox Series X features Mando himself. (No, there&#x27;s no option with Pedro Pascal&#x27;s face instead.)


The bundle will be made available via sweepstake - so yes, you get both consoles - and also includes a Yoda-green controller and a replica of little Grogu&#x27;s sweater. Entry is as simple as retweeting the official Xbox Twitter account from today until 11th May.

&quot;The company is focused on building a culture of inclusiveness,&quot; reads the statement. &quot;We have a workplace Code of Conduct policy that has been consistently shared with employees, and when that policy is clearly violated, we take appropriate disciplinary action. Using abusive, harassing, or threatening language toward colleagues is unacceptable, and we are disappointed that the CWA is advocating for this type of behaviour.&quot;

Now, Bungie has added a touching memorial to the fallen Exo, which players can visit within Destiny 2&#x27;s Tower hub. 


Interacting with Cayde&#x27;s bust prompts dialogue lines reflecting on Cayde&#x27;s life from other Destiny 2 stalwarts such as Ikora and Zavala. These memorials also include a line from The Crow - who does not remember killing Cayde in his former life as Uldren Sov.

                              <span>Story details for the upcoming Silent Hill 2 film have leaked online, suggesting this adaptation will pivot from its original source material. 


Officially announced back in October, Return to Silent Hill will tell the story of &quot;a young guy coming back to Silent Hill, where he has known a great love and what he&#x27;s going to find is a pure nightmare&quot;, according to film director Christophe Gans. 


All in all, that sounds very Silent Hill 2. But according to German film site FilmPortal (via reddit), there will also be a few changes made to the game&#x27;s main plot.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has criticised the term JRPG, sparking debate among players online.


In an interview with Skill-Up following previews of the game, Yoshida was asked about how JRPGs have advanced in comparison to action games. According to the interviewer, Yoshida was visibly uncomfortable with the phrase.


&quot;One thing [Yoshida] wants to get across is that when we create games, we don&#x27;t go into them thinking we are creating JRPGs, we are just creating RPGs. The term JRPG is used by western media rather than users and media in Japan,&quot; said localisation director Koji Fox.

                              <span>Call of Duty will no longer feature console-exclusive DLC content  if it is owned by Microsoft, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said.


Speaking to Xbox On, Spencer said future versions of Activision&#x27;s shooter franchise would simply aim to be &quot;the best version of Call of Duty&quot; on any platform, without offering extra skins or guns to Xbox players.


Of course, all of this is contingent on Microsoft completing its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout - which is by no means a done deal.

According to Kotaku, QA testers were informed they were losing their jobs, effective immediately, during a mandatory Zoom meeting held at 8am CT by their contracting agency Magnit Global. Sources told the site that EA&#x27;s whole Baton Rouge QA team has now been disbanded as a result of the call, amounting to what one former employee called &quot;essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff&quot; on Twitter.


In a statement provided to Kotaku, EA did not comment on the layoffs directly, but did confirm changes at its Baton Rouge office. &quot;As part of our ongoing global strategy,&quot; the publisher wrote, &quot;we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending testing execution that&#x27;s been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider.&quot;

                              <span>Universal Pictures is shifting the release date of The Super Mario Bros. Movie forward by two days to 5th April in the US and &quot;60 other markets&quot;.


If you&#x27;ve already lost track of when The Super Mario Bros. Movie is due to arrive, that&#x27;s entirely understandable; Universal has shunted its release date around the calender a number of times already, initially aiming for December 2022 before switching to an early March release across a large number of territories, including Australia, Europe, and the UK.


The US, meanwhile, was due to receive the movie a little later on 7th April - a date seemingly adopted as the new global release by the time The Super Mario Bros. Movie&#x27;s most recent, easter-egg-laden trailer arrived earlier this month.

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the company behind the acclaimed likes of This War of Mine and Frostpunk, has unveiled The Thaumaturge, a new &quot;story-rich&quot; isometric RPG from developer Fool&#x27;s Theory being published as part of partnership announced last year.


Fool&#x27;s Theory - a &quot;collective of AAA veterans&quot; whose work includes open-world RPG Seven: The Days Long Gone and the in-development remake of the original Witcher for CD Projekt - initially teased its new RPG under the name Project Vitriol last June, describing it as a &quot;deep, morally ambiguous, narrative-driven&quot; game and promising more details soon.


A little later than expected, Project Vitriol has now been given its proper unveiling as The Thaurmaturge, a &quot;story-driven RPG with a unique take on combat, character development features, and investigation mechanics&quot; that touches on the &quot;complex theme of inner demons&quot;.

                              <span>Hitman developer IO Interactive has confirmed it is working on a new online fantasy RPG. 


This &quot;bold&quot; release is still in the early stages of development, IO stated today, sharing a single piece of early exploration concept art (see above).


&quot;We are building a new world, a new IP - an online fantasy RPG,&quot; IO wrote in a new blog post. &quot;A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come. It feels familiar, yet at the same time IO Interactive is going on a journey unlike any we have been on before.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has commented once again on a PC version of the game, and confirmed it won&#x27;t be available six months after the PS5 release.


As shared on the Japanese PlayStation Blog (thanks, Wario64), Yoshida said he would love to release a PC version but that it simply could not be ready that soon after the PS5 version is released.




&quot;I&#x27;ve caused a bit of a stir with my remarks the other day, but I&#x27;d like to touch on the PC version,&quot; said Yoshida, referring to previous comments we reported on.

                              <span>Praise the Erdtree! An expansion for Elden Ring has finally been confirmed by FromSoftware.


It&#x27;s not much of a surprise considering there&#x27;s precedent for DLC in the Souls series - not to mention a cool 20m copies of Elden Ring sold - but fans of the game will finally get more of the Lands Between.


Or maybe it&#x27;s not the Lands Between at all? Which characters will be the focus of this expansion? And what&#x27;s happened to that tree?

A new Modern Warfare 2 skin for Hutch (known as &quot;Foxy&quot;) leaves very little to the imagination thanks to the inclusion of some skin tight tights that accentuate every curve and bulge of the operator&#x27;s physique. I mean every curve.


This particular skin comes as part of the Red Fox Tracer pack.

                              <span>Resident Evil 5 has received a new update on Steam. 


Along with some smaller bug fixes, this update has also added local split-screen co-op. Yes, after nearly 14 years, it is here.


The split-screen co-op feature was native to all console versions, but has been notably absent from the PC version.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s legendary Shigeru Miyamoto has been asked how he thinks the company will fare without him one day.


Miyamoto, now 70, originally joined Nintendo in 1977, before going on to help create Donkey Kong, Mario and The Legend of Zelda. In the decades since, Miyamoto has become synonymous with Nintendo, and his projects have continually found huge success. 


In an interview with NPR, Miyamoto was asked what Nintendo will look like without him. His response? That actually, it would be very similar.

                              <span>Kerbal Space Program 2 released in early access last week, but has left players feeling like it needed longer on the launchpad.


Current Steam reviews for the space-flight simulator are decidedly mixed, with many users lamenting the game&#x27;s buggy state. 


&quot;Barely playable, feel like they should be paying me to play it at this point in development,&quot; wrote one user, with another adding the game is &quot;broken in almost every way possible&quot;. Meanwhile, others have stated they have asked for refunds, and advise those interested in Kerbal Space Program to play the original instead.

The news follows a middling reception to Forspoken by critics and consumers, and will formally begin on 1st May. 


In a statement, Luminous Productions said it would remain &quot;entirely focused on Forspoken&quot; until that date, and continue working on the game&#x27;s previously-announced patch to address performance issues plus upcoming DLC &quot;In Tanta We Trust&quot; which is scheduled to launch this summer.

                              <span>Ubisoft Montpellier - the studio behind the extremely long-in-development Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 - is reportedly facing upheaval as it grapples with a labour investigation into &quot;unprecedented&quot; levels of employee stress and sickness, and the departure of its managing director.


As reported by Kotaku, Ubisoft Montpellier - perhaps best known for its work on the Rayman games under studio founder Michel Ancel, who departed in 2020 amid claims of toxic behaviour - is currently being investigated by Montpellier&#x27;s Inspection du Travail due to an &quot;unprecedented number of developers experiencing burnout and going on sick leave&quot;.


According to the website&#x27;s sources, who were unauthorised to speak about the issue and wished to remain anonymous, &quot;dozens&quot; of Ubisoft Montpellier developers, including &quot;many&quot; leads, have taken extended leave for stress or sickness over the last year, with some choosing not to return - a situation leading to a visit from the French labour inspection office in December.

                              <span>The Sims&#x27;s 4 new life-stage-focused Growing Together expansion is just a couple of weeks away from launch, and ahead of its 16th March arrival, EA has shared a new gameplay trailer offering a closer look at its various additions in action.


Growing Together - which arrives alongside the free Infants update - is a bit unusual in that it&#x27;s not built around one flagship feature, but rather a set of systems designed to make for richer dynamics between Sims across all life stages.


As shown in its new gameplay trailer, basic dynamics between individual household members can now be explicitly set - with choices including distant, closer, difficult, and jokesters - and these relationships can be further augmented through Milestones and Compatibility.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in the market for a bit of gaming merchandise that just might make your eyeballs inflate dangerously in your skull from sheer cuteness overload, publisher Finji is here to help with an official plushie version of the fox from Andrew Shouldice&#x27;s acclaimed action-adventure Tunic.


Ordinarily, cute fluffy plushies probably wouldn&#x27;t be top of my news list (unless we&#x27;re talking about the Monster Hunter ones, cos those&#x27;re bloody great), but the chorus of &#x27;awws&#x27; and &#x27;ahhhhs&#x27; in the Eurogamer Slack when this thing got posted suggests interest may be high. Also, it&#x27;s cute enough that even I&#x27;m tempted to get one, and I don&#x27;t even particularly love Tunic.


Tunic&#x27;s official fox plushie - which comes complete with adorably squishy detachable sword and shield - has been made in collaboration with Fangamer, meaning you&#x27;ll either have to get it via the company&#x27;s website or hope it pops up at local convention.

                              <span>CRYSTALS-Kyber is one of the public-key algorithms currently recommended by NIST as part of its post-quantum cryptography standardization process.
Researchers have just published a side-channel attack—using power consumption—against an implementation of the algorithm that was supposed to be resistant against that sort of attack.
The algorithm is not “broken” or “cracked”—despite headlines to the contrary—this is just a  side-channel attack. What makes this work really interesting is that the researchers used a machine-learning model to train the system to exploit the side channel...</span>

Essentially an extended flashback, this episode provides viewers with crucial background information about Ellie, revealing what motivates her and what shaped her to become the Ellie we know today. 


As always, episode seven leaves us with plenty to discuss, so let&#x27;s get into it.

                              <span>Pokémon Sleep, the franchise&#x27;s snooze-tracking app first announced four years ago, is finally close to launch.


Today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents livestream gave us a long-awaited update on the app, which is now set to debut for iPhone and Android devices this summer. 


As previously announced, the app will use your phone to track the length and quality of your sleep, and let you gather in-game Pokémon depending on how good a night&#x27;s rest you got.

                              <span>Happy Pokémon Day, everyone - our annual check-in on what to expect from The Pokémon Company&#x27;s many projects over the course of this year. 


We&#x27;re expecting to hear more about post launch plans for last year&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet, including its tie-in with Pokémon Go where you can grab coin goblin Gimmighoul. 


What else? Rumours are swirling we might see a new Pokémon Mystery Dungeon spin-off, there&#x27;s the brand new Pokémon TV series starring Captain Pikachu, and there&#x27;s hope - as ever - for the long-lost Pokémon Sleep app which was last mentioned four years ago.

                              <span>Ex-BioWare veteran David Gaider wants EA to remake Dragon Age: Origins. 


Gaider expressed an interest in a new version of the RPG series&#x27; initial entry on Twitter, as word spread that EA was considering further Dead Space remakes.


&quot;If we&#x27;re on a kick re-mastering games from the aughts, what about Dragon Age Origins?&quot; Gaider wrote. &quot;Its graphics were behind the curve even at the time of release... can you imagine it with brand new PS5-era bells and whistles? 🥳&quot;

                              <span>Dataminers have discovered secret bonus points are given out in Mario Kart Super Circuit for everyone except Yoshi.


At the end of each Grand Prix, players are awarded a rank from E (lowest) to three stars (highest), which is calculated using a complex formula. However, free bonus points are also awarded based on the character the player chooses.


If the player chooses Bowser, for instance, they will receive an extra 45 points for their choice. Yoshi players get nothing.

These include a project from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Rogue studio Ubisoft Sofia with story elements set in multiple time periods, including the highly-requested Aztec Empire, as well as India and the Mediterranean.


The other projects discussed by Insider Gaming sound like smaller spin-offs, such as a free-to-play four-player PVE co-op game from Ubisoft Chengdu, a multiplayer project which uses Ubisoft&#x27;s nebulous cloud computing tech from Ubisoft Annecy and Massive Entertainment, and a second Assassin&#x27;s Creed VR project.

The official Five Night at Freddy&#x27;s Cookbook - called, unsurprisingly, the Official Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s Cookbook – features 40+ recipes for just the type of tucker you&#x27;d expect at the Pizzaplex, including Fredbear&#x27;s Pepperoni X-Press, Chica&#x27;s Ultimate Thai Chicken Burger, Foxy&#x27;s Fruity Cove Cooler, and El Chip&#x27;s Fully Loaded Tortillas.

&quot;The one and only OFFICIAL Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s Cookbook, with over 40 recipes inspired by the hit games,&quot; says the blurb. &quot;Delight in over forty tasty recipes inspired by the Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s games, with gorgeous, eye-popping photography!

                              <span>Bungie is currently investigating an issue where the early preload of Destiny 2&#x27;s upcoming expansion, Lightfall, is locking players out of the game entirely.

Right now, it seems as though the issue is chiefly affecting those on PS5 and players that don&#x27;t delete and reinstall the game may find themselves locked out completely until launch day. 

&quot;We&#x27;re currently investigating an issue where the preload of Lightfall has been pushed out early in some regions,&quot; Bungie tweeted over the weekend. &quot;We recommend players pause this download until February 27, 9 AM PST (-8 UTC) to continue playing the live game.&quot;

                              <span>Congress is currently debating bills that would ban TikTok in the United States. We are here as technologists to tell you that this is a terrible idea and the side effects would be intolerable. Details matter. There are several ways Congress might ban TikTok, each with different efficacies and side effects. In the end, all the effective ones would destroy the free Internet as we know it.
There’s no doubt that TikTok and ByteDance, the company that owns it, are shady. They, like most large corporations in China, operate at the pleasure of the Chinese government. They collect extreme levels of information about users. But they’re not alone: Many apps you use do the same, including Facebook and Instagram, along with seemingly innocuous apps that have no need for the data. Your data is bought and sold by data brokers you’ve never heard of who have few scruples about where the data ends up. They have digital dossiers on most people in the United States...</span>

                              <span>Atomic Heart developer Mundfish has apologised after footage of a racist cartoon was found in its newly released shooter.

Whilst the footage wasn&#x27;t directly designed by Mundfish – apparently, the cartoon concerned is a real Soviet Tom &#x27;n&#x27; Jerry-esque animated series called Nu, Pogodli! that ran in Russia from the 60s – the studio apologised for &quot;hurt and insult&quot; caused by the offensive cartoon and said it will &quot;edit the parts in question&quot; after players discovered it in one of the game&#x27;s save rooms.

&quot;The Mundfish team thanks the PC Gamer contributor for bringing this lack of sensitivity to our attention,&quot; the developer reportedly said.

                              <span>Metroid Prime Remastered is finally here – and so, it seems, are the scalpers, with dozens of the game&#x27;s currently sold-out physical editions popping up on internet auction sites for considerably more than the original asking price. 

Whilst the issue seems to be primarily affecting our friends on the other side of the pond – the UK&#x27;s version doesn&#x27;t release until next month – many people are trying to cash in on the physical edition&#x27;s popularity by listing the game for over twice its recommended retail price (thanks, Kotaku). 

Don&#x27;t forget that although physical copies of Super Mario 3D All-Stars were sold in very limited numbers intentionally – which also artificially pushed up the price – Nintendo has not made a similar claim about Metroid Prime Remastered, so it&#x27;s possible more units will be available at a later date. That&#x27;s not stopping some giving it a go, though.

                              <span>Tales of Symphonia Remastered&#x27;s development team has apologised for any &quot;inconvenience caused&quot; by the remaster&#x27;s less-than-stellar launch and says that it is &quot;investigating a fix&quot;.

We already knew that fans were disappointed at Tales of Symphonia Remastered&#x27;s low frame rate - it runs at 30fps, when the GameCube original was 60fps, presumably because the remaster is based on the PS2 version - but fans have been hitting back since it launched earlier this week, citing numerous crashes and bugs.

&quot;Thank you for playing Tales of Symphonia Remastered for Nintendo Switch,&quot; the team said via a Twitter thread (as translated by Twitter&#x27;s built-in translation feature) (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>We already knew that survival horror sequel Sons of the Forest was blowing up on Steam, but now we have the numbers to prove it.

That&#x27;s according to developer Endnight Games, which recently revealed that although the game is still in early access, it still managed to sell &quot;over two million copies in the first 24 hours&quot; since launch.

&quot;Thanks to those who have joined us in our Early Access journey into Sons Of The Forest,&quot; Endnight tweeted. &quot;We have sold over 2 million copies in the first 24 hours, and are very excited for what we have in store for players in the coming weeks.&quot;

                              <span>Cyanide Studios has posted a lengthy response to fans unhappy at the current state – and monetisation strategy – of Blood Bowl 3.

With just 27 per cent of players giving the game a thumbs up on Steam – that&#x27;s a 73 per cent disapproval rate amassed from almost a thousand players at this point – Cyanide outlined what &quot;players can expect [...] as we move forward&quot; as well as explore the &quot;sensitive topic&quot; of monetisation.

After thanking players for supporting the game, the team identified six main complaints: &quot;the monetisation, the Brutal Edition, the game state, the server issues, the Faction Leaks, and the Blood Bowl team&quot;.

                              <span>Blood Bowl 3 may have only just been released, but it&#x27;s already getting a kicking on Steam.

Cyanide Studio&#x27;s latest instalment comes eight years after Blood Bowl 2, but it seems as though some players don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been worth the wait. Right now, the self-proclaimed &quot;iconic death sport&quot; boasts a &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; aggregate rating on Steam – that&#x27;s a 73 per cent disapproval rate – amassed from almost 800 players.

&quot;I love Blood Bowl, but this game is a mess,&quot; said one unhappy player.

                              <span>EA wants to know if Dead Space fans would be interested in a Dead Space 2 or 3 remake.

As spotted by the folks at ResetEra, EA is currently polling selected players to ascertain exactly how interested they would be in a &quot;similar remake&quot; to Motive&#x27;s excellent reimagining of the original Dead Space game.  

Surprising? Not really, given the success of the first remake. But as some of the ResetEra commenters opine, Dead Space 3 may need &quot;some changes&quot; if it&#x27;s to reach the acclaim Dead Space Remake has achieved thus far.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play Brawlhalla has revealed it is adding real-time captioning to &quot;significantly boost accessibility in live stream gaming&quot;.

Teaming with Speechmatics, Ubisoft says Brawlhalla&#x27;s 80 million players make the game &quot;a prime title to demonstrate the value and importance of accessibility&quot;  and will be using Speechmatics&#x27; real-time speech-to-text API for all live streams, esports tournaments, and the game&#x27;s twice-weekly developer streams.

&quot;The integration of these Closed Captions follows the CEA-608 standard,&quot; Ubisoft explains in a statement. &quot;As a result, these Closed Captions are supported by a large portion of Over The Top (OTT) services, including but not limited to Twitch and Youtube.

                              <span>Medieval extraction looter, Dark and Darker, has scheduled another playtest in April.

The additional test comes ahead of the game&#x27;s Early Access launch towards the end of April or the beginning of May (as yet, Ironmace has not committed to a specific date).

After thanking the community for helping the game run its &quot;most successful playtest to date&quot;, the team said that because the &quot;recent playtest also gave [them] a lot of clues on how to proceed with development&quot;, it had &quot;decided to schedule another playtest prior to [its] Early Access launch&quot;.

In its sixth dev blog, this one entitled &quot;Back to the Beginning&quot;, senior producer Philippe Ducharme, art director Mike Yazijian, and creative director Roman Campos-Oriola reflected upon the project&#x27;s earliest days &quot;and its iconic inspiration&quot; to reveal how &quot;exactly&quot; the Dead Space remake &quot;came into being&quot;.

&quot;The Star Wars Squadrons team was starting to wrap up the game,&quot; said Ducharme, &quot;and they were looking for the next project. And Patrick [Klaus, General Manager of Motive] was brainstorming with the team leads, and one of them was Mike Yazijian, who was the art director for the Montreal portion of Dead Space 2. Mike was keen to make more Dead Space.&quot;

                              <span>Following a report in January that Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony would all be skipping this year&#x27;s efforts to revitalise a flagging E3, Nintendo has confirmed it won&#x27;t be attending the show.


In a statement provided to VentureBeat, Nintendo explained, &quot;We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year&#x27;s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.&quot;


It&#x27;s perhaps not entirely surprising news, of course, given Nintendo hasn&#x27;t held a major E3 conference for over a decade now, instead favouring its own Nintendo Direct broadcasts to convey its big news, and that the company last had a showfloor presence at E3 back in 2019.

New Zealand&#x27;s makeover marks the 12th World Update to release for Flight Simulator since its launch in 2020, and follows similar spruce-ups for - deep breath - Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.


World Update 12 brings similar additions to those seen in previous updates, meaning new high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery, plus improved digital elevation models. It also features seven new photogrammetry enhanced cities - Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton, Nelson, Queenstown, Tauranga, and Wellington - and nine new handcrafted airports.

                              <span>Last night&#x27;s Sony State of Play broadcast brought us a fresh look at the long-awaited Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and our first confirmation it will release for PlayStation 5 as well as PC. 


But what about Xbox? Had Sony splashed its cash and bought timed exclusivity? Or even full exclusivity?


Some viewers wondered if we&#x27;d hear about a version of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 for Microsoft&#x27;s consoles in due course, after Sony&#x27;s show concluded. After all, it&#x27;d be nothing new for console makers to keep mention of their rivals out of such events.

Well, however you choose to play Horizon Call of the Mountain, it turns out Aloy is a lot shorter than some players imagined. 


Players have been sharing screenshots on social media of the game and the series&#x27; protagonist does indeed look a little small. One player even gave her a little boop on the nose.

                              <span>The Day Before developer Fntastic is embroiled in a trademark dispute with a Korean calendar app of the same name, Eurogamer can confirm.


Earlier this month, Fntastic tweeted that videos of its forthcoming game had been removed from Steam and YouTube due to a trademark dispute. &quot;The so-called &#x27;owner&#x27; of the rights to the title is the creator of the calendar app, which has nothing to do with the games category,&quot; the studio said.



Now, in a response to Eurogamer, the developer of the calendar app has confirmed it holds the trademark rights to the app&#x27;s name &#x27;The Day Before&#x27; and is &quot;taking measures to protect trademark rights&quot;.

                              <span>Survival horror sequel Sons of the Forest is currently blowing up on Steam after its early access launch there yesterday.


Set on an island filled with cannibals and mutants where you must chop down trees and craft stuctures and weapons to survive, Sons of the Forest is the long-awaited sequel to the well-received The Forest.


Four years on from The Forest&#x27;s debut (and eight since it first launched via its own early access programme), this follow-up now sits comfortably on top of Steam&#x27;s list of best-selling games by revenue, above Company of Heroes 3 and Destiny 2, which is currently selling its new Lightfall expansion.

                              <span>One of the big surprises from Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play broadcast was the announcement of a virtual reality game based on Isaac Asimov&#x27;s much-loved sci-fi book series, Foundation.


Journey to Foundation, developed by Canadian studio Archiact, is due out on PSVR2, Meta Quest 2 and Pico 4 autumn 2023.


The announcement trailer, which begins with a quote from Asimov&#x27;s book, talks about the Empire falling and the galaxy plunging into 30,000 years of chaos and war. That&#x27;s very much the same setup as Asimov&#x27;s series, which revolves around a devastating prediction of humanity&#x27;s collapse by a maths genius called Hari Seldon. The Foundation itself is a group led by Seldon that attempts to limit the impact of this inevitable collapse by populating new, far-flung worlds. Suffice it to say, this plan does not go exactly to plan. Or maybe it does, if you&#x27;re Hari Seldon.

                              <span>Video game publisher Embracer has announced a new movie deal to put The Lord of the Rings back on the big screen. 


Embracer has had a mixed time of late, with its big budget Saints Row reboot failing to find an audience and its Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake from Aspyr reportedly being placed &quot;on pause&quot;.


For Embracer, this lucrative film deal with New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures is far more positive news. &quot;Multiple&quot; movies are planned, expanding on &quot;the revered works of JRR Tolkien&quot;, including elements from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

                              <span>Last night, during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play broadcast, Capcom revealed first looks at three Street Fighter 6 characters: Zangief, Lily and Cammy.


It&#x27;s fair to say Cammy&#x27;s reveal has drawn the most attention from the Street Fighter community. The popular British special forces operative has a new look for Street Fighter 6, which is going down well with fans, with more than a few nods to previous iterations of the character.


My favourite reference is to the much-loved 1994 Street Fighter 2 animated movie, which saw Cammy handstand on a goon&#x27;s shoulders, snap their neck, then drop down for a crunching leg attack (that last bit always felt like overkill to me - he&#x27;s already dead, Cammy!).

                              <span>The Legend of Dragoon fans are disappointed with the game&#x27;s bug-riddled port to current consoles.


The cult classic JRPG was added to PS Plus (and the PlayStation Store) this week, marking its digital debut in Europe.


However, fans have reported a string of bugs, and some have claimed the game is unplayable.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Call of Duty will be another Modern Warfare game, just a year after 2022&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2. 


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who detailed Activision&#x27;s upcoming entry in its annual shooter series in a report last night. 


This game was originally planned as a &quot;premium expansion&quot; for Modern Warfare 2, but is now being spun out into a full release, breaking the series&#x27; regular pattern of cycling through its various sub-brands.

Now, we have an answer. And it comes in the shape of Captain Pikachu, a new character set to star in the Pokémon franchise&#x27;s all new animated series set to debut later this year. 


Who is Captain Pikachu? This Pikachu wears what appears to be pilot&#x27;s hat, and is the partner Pokémon of another new character, a silver-haired chap named Friede.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft&#x27;s next steps to get its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout past regulators and over the finish line.

Earlier this week, Microsoft went to Brussels to argue its case with the European Commission, one of three major regulators still needing to be convinced - and Eurogamer was in attendance. It had agreements with Nintendo and Nvidia in its pocket, but only an unsigned contract with PlayStation. Was it enough? And if not, what else must Microsoft now do?
Does Microsoft still need to offer further concessions around Game Pass? Could we even see Microsoft let COD go onto PlayStation Plus to ensure full parity? Joining me to discuss all that and share our thoughts on whether we think the deal will finally get done are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Developer Motion Twin has dropped a few final teases for rogue-like action-platformer Dead Cells&#x27; paid Castlevania expansion ahead of its launch on 6th March, including the news it&#x27;ll let purchasers play as an unlockable Richter Belmont.


Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire have previously described Return to Castlevania as &quot;our very own love letter to the granddad of Dead Cells&quot;, and a newly shared gameplay trailer offers a closer look at some of many nods to Konami&#x27;s classic platform series players will encounter as they navigate the exterior and interior of Dracula&#x27;s Castle in the expansion&#x27;s two new biomes.


The big reveal, though, is that Return to Castlevania features a secret level which, once discovered, unlocks Richter Belmont as a playable character. Richter - who first appeared in 1993&#x27;s Castlevania: Rondo of Blood - comes equipped with his later Symphony of the Night moveset, and players are able to expand on that by breaking candles to unlock additional moves, such as a high jump, and new weapons.

Tonight, a launch trailer for Destiny 2: Lightfall showcased the long-awaited arrival of the Darkness at Earth, led by its gooey-headed big bad The Witness. 


Destiny&#x27;s heroes gear up to defend the planet, but it&#x27;s clear that their forces are outmatched - until the Traveller itself finally powers up and gets stuck in.

                              <span>Warner Bros. just announced Mortal Kombat 12 for release in 2023 in a financial call.


The surprise confirmation of NetherRealm&#x27;s next fighting game came without fanfare or a trailer, which you&#x27;d normally expect alongside the reveal of a big game such as a new Mortal Kombat.


There&#x27;s nothing so far on Mortal Kombat 12 from NetherRealm&#x27;s socials, or Warner Bros. Games, specifically. NetherRealm chief Ed Boon has yet to tweet about it either.

                              <span>Tokyo game studio THA, in conjunction with Tetris Effect developer Enhance, is releasing its long-in-the-works PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC crowd puzzler Humanity in May.


THA first started showcasing Humanity back in 2017, and it was re-announced, this time with ties to Enhance, two years later for an anticipated 2020 release on PlayStation 4/PSVR.


That obviously never came to pass, and now Humanity has been given a fresh airing during PlayStation&#x27;s latest State of Play livestream. It looks as dazzlingly chaotic as ever, as players - in the role of a Shiba Inu - shepherd huge crowds of purposeless people at the end of the world.

As previously leaked, the game will have a battle pass focused solely on providing further cosmetic customisation to the game&#x27;s four antiheroes:  Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and King Shark.


Rocksteady confirmed tonight that the game will also get new playable characters and missions post-launch as well. A new FAQ page confirms these will be made &quot;available at no cost&quot;.

That&#x27;s a little less than three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, and no less than 23 years after Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2.


Tonight we got a fresh glimpse at the game during Sony&#x27;s latest State of Play broadcast, which also revealed a new antagonist: a necromancer played by Whiplash and Spider-Man&#x27;s JK Simmons.

Synapse unfolds in an abstract black-and-white world that becomes streaked with violent neon hues as the action unfolds, and nDreams describes its run-and-gun gameplay as an evolution of its 2021 shooter Fracked. 


It&#x27;s all built around dual-wielding combat, enabling players to wield a gun in one hand and do an altogether different kind of damage using Synapses&#x27; &quot;1:1&quot; telekinesis system with the other.

Embark unveiled The Finals, which will be free-to-play on release, last September with an eye-catching reveal trailer showcasing its impressive central gimmick: the ability to thoroughly alter and destroy every arena in the game, including every building and item within it.


The whole thing is presented as a kind of The Running Man-style televised bloodsport, and each match will feature four teams of three players. The action isn&#x27;t limited to firearms either, and The Finals promises the likes of melee weapons, and even a foam gun with a range of practical uses.

                              <span>Forza Horizon 5 is revving up for a different kind of driving experience courtesy of its newly announced Rally Adventure expansion, coming to Xbox and PC on 29th March.


Rally Adventure, in case it wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious, is all about bringing what developer Playground Games calls the &quot;rally experience&quot; to Forza Horizon 5, and that means a trip to a rugged new map (nominally located north of the existing one) known as Sierra Nueva.


Here, racers can let loose, taking in the expansion&#x27;s new deformable terrain and kick-up effects system, as well as landmarks including new towns, a quarry (complete with overhead conveyor belts to drive on), and Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s first completely smash-able forest.

It&#x27;s been an astonishing eight years since Rocksteady released Batman: Arkham Knight. Now, we&#x27;re finally just a couple of months away from seeing what it&#x27;s been up to since. Tonight we&#x27;ll get an extended look, lasting about 15 minutes. 

Before that, Sony is treating us to a quick whizz through five VR games on the way to its newly-launched PlayStation VR2 headset. We&#x27;ll be commentating on all of that live - so do join us later to watch along together!

                              <span>This is really interesting research from a few months ago:
Abstract: Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. Delegation of learning has clear benefits, and at the same time raises serious concerns of trust. This work studies possible abuses of power by untrusted learners.We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate “backdoor key,” the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees...</span>

The news comes after a tough period for the looter shooter, which finally launched on Steam in January - four years after it came out.


In early February, Ubisoft announced it had delayed the planned 7th February launch of Season 11 due to a localisation issue.

The most recent episode of The Last of Us gave us a closer look at the mental impact Joel&#x27;s situation is having on him. On two occasions, Joel can be seen clutching his chest as the camera pulls in close and the noise around him distorts. He is having panic attacks.


In the first instance of this happening, Joel assures Ellie that it was just the cold air taking him by surprise. The second time, however, Joel is on his own, and is only &#x27;calmed&#x27; by the sight of a young woman who for a moment Joel imagines to be his daughter, Sarah.

Helpfully, you can now take your financial planning for this year one step further thanks to Steam, which has published the dates for all the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3645136358931000680

Steam sale dates are usually announced closer to when the sale begins, so this is a welcome update. The list includes dates for the four major seasonal sales, as well as Fest events dedicated to specific genres.

                              <span>Ubisoft has announced a patch for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate that fixes a flickering issue in the game on PS5.
Syndicate originally came out in 2015 for PS4, Xbox One and PC, and is playable on PS5 through backwards compatibility. The visual issue has been present since the game launched on PS5, with many asking Ubisoft to provide a fix for a while.
Ubisoft released a patch today to address the problem, which will hopefully allow players to enjoy the game in comfort and worry-free of potential health issues which can arise from flickering lights.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide continues its long road to recovery - a significant new patch is now available to download.


Patch #4 - Blessings of the Omnissiah includes a long list of additions, changes and fixes for the four-player co-op action game, which currently sits on a &quot;mostly negative&quot; Steam user review rating for the last 30 days.


The hotly-anticipated Darktide launched on PC at the end of November, and while players generally agreed the core gameplay was enjoyable, it suffered from a raft of technical issues, performance problems and a lack of a meaningful crafting system.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 2 got the much-loved Gun Game mode this week - and players have discovered it uses the classic Call of Duty mini-map that&#x27;s absent from the rest of the game.


Call of Duty&#x27;s mini-map is always a talking point, but Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s iteration proved particularly divisive.


Unlike some previous Call of Duty games, Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s mini-map only shows enemy player dots when a UAV is active. This means it does not display red dots when enemy players sprint or fire their unsuppressed weapons.

                              <span>Batman Arkham developer Rocksteady has amped up the violence for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, a new 18 rating for the game has revealed. 


Suicide Squad has been rated in Singapore, where the country&#x27;s ratings board has detailed how the game contains strong scenes of violence, including &quot;a character with a blade impaled in the neck, another&#x27;s heart being ripped out, and a man being decapitated with blood spurting out of the neck stump&quot;.


Fans on reddit have noted how the rating board appears to reference specific moments of violence described in a previous plot leak for the game that included major deaths - which we won&#x27;t divulge here.

                              <span>Half-Life: Ray Traced, a new mod adding hardware accelerated ray tracing to Valve&#x27;s seminal first-person shooter, is now available to download following its reveal last summer.


Half-Life: Ray Traced is the work of modder Sultim Tsyrendashiev - who previously created similar, extremely well-received ray tracing mods for the likes of Series Sam 1, Doom, and Quake - and is based on another previous attempt at Half-Life ray tracing.


Introducing the project last year, Tsyrendashiev explained, &quot;Half-Life: Ray Traced integrates the real-time path tracing into the original Half-Life (1998). With the hardware accelerated ray tracing, it is possible to calculate global illumination, reflections, refractions, soft shadows and other visual effects with interactive framerates.&quot;

                              <span>Tohru Okada, the musician and music producer responsible for creating PlayStation&#x27;s iconic logo sound, has died aged 73.


Okada&#x27;s music career spanned decades and a wide variety of mediums including movies and anime, but he was perhaps best known in Japan as a founding member of influential rock band Moonriders, where he played alongside bandmate Keiichi Suzuki - who would go on to compose the music for Nintendo&#x27;s Mother series.


Okada&#x27;s own ties to gaming came primarily through his successful career composing for commercials. He notably wrote music for a series of very strange Crash Bandicoot adverts in the 90s (thanks Gamespot), but his most enduring - and immediately recognisable - contribution to gaming arrived through his work with PlayStation.

To date, New World&#x27;s monetisation (after an initial full-price purchase) has largely be focused around a cosmetics-based premium shop but, from March, players will have the option to purchase the new Season Pass&#x27; 100-tier paid reward track as part of a shift to a three-month seasonal release model. A free track will also be also available.


To progress through a Season Pass and unlock the likes of emotes, skins, gear, Boost Tokens, and &quot;other seasonal loot&quot;, players will need to earn Season XP by completing objectives in the new Season Journey, Challenges, and Activity Card. XP can also be accrued through Quests, Faction Missions, Town Projects, Expedition Bosses, Outpost Rush, 3v3 Arenas, and more.

Its conclusion:
Cyber defense assistance in Ukraine is working. The Ukrainian government and Ukrainian critical infrastructure organizations have better defended themselves and achieved higher levels of resiliency due to the efforts of CDAC and many others. But this is not the end of the road—the ability to provide cyber defense assistance will be important in the future. As a result, it is timely to assess how to provide organized, effective cyber defense assistance to safeguard the post-war order from potential aggressors...</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has added six more countries to its Xbox Game Pass Friends &amp; Family plan roll-out, meaning the account sharing service is now available across eight countries.


Xbox Game Pass Friends &amp; Family - which launched as a limited &quot;preview&quot; last September after months of speculation and rumours - gives up to five people access to all Game Pass Ultimate benefits at a significant discount compared to individual memberships.


For its initial pilot, the service was limited to Colombia and the Republic of Ireland but Microsoft confirmed more counties could be added to that meagre list in the &quot;next months&quot;. True to its word, the company has now expanded the plan&#x27;s availability into Chile, Hungary, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, and Sweden starting today.

PSVR 2 support arrives alongside a selection of new additions for all platforms in today&#x27;s Fractal update.


On the new stuff front, No Man Sky&#x27;s Fractal update will usher in a fresh limited-time Expedition, titled Utopia, shortly after release. This challenges Travellers to team up and rebuild an abandoned solar system for the mysterious Utopia Foundation.


By completing the Expedition&#x27;s various milestones, players can unlock a number of rewards, including the Fearsome Visor helmet, a new robotic drone companion, plus a new ship type known as the Utopia Speeder, capable of skimming across planet surfaces at high velocity.

This week, fans spotted a change to the description of the game&#x27;s remote raid passes - premium items introduced during the early days of the Covid pandemic to allow Pokémon Go players to take part in raid battles from afar.


That change noted players &quot;can join {0} Raids a day&quot;, with the ultimate number as yet unset. After word of the change spread, this description was then quickly removed.

What&#x27;s more, Sony has also not provided tracking information, leaving customers in the dark about when their PSVR2 will actually arrive.

On iPhone, Angry Birds will stay available - albeit under a new and instantly-forgettable name: &quot;Red&#x27;s First Flight&quot;.


Why? In a statement, Rovio suggests the original Angry Birds is simply too popular, and that players are too happy to spend the app&#x27;s one-off 79p price rather than download the brand&#x27;s many free-to-play sequels and spin-offs which contain further microtransactions.

                              <span>Valve has issued a stark warning to Dota 2 cheaters, while confirming it has permanently banned over 40,000 accounts using a &quot;honeypot&quot; tactic.


In a blog post published last night, Valve said it had banned accounts it found were using third-party software to cheat in its hugely popular MOBA over the last few weeks.


According to Valve, this software accessed information used internally by the Dota client that wasn&#x27;t visible during normal gameplay, giving cheaters an unfair advantage.

                              <span>Microsoft will not consider a version of its proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout where it cannot also get its hands on Call of Duty, company president Brad Smith has said. 


The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority regulator previously suggested Activision sell off Call of Duty first, in order to make Microsoft&#x27;s buyout more palatable amidst anti-competition concerns. 


Speaking yesterday in Brussels at a press briefing attended by Eurogamer, Smith said Microsoft didn&#x27;t &quot;see a viable path&quot; to a deal where Call of Duty was owned by someone else.

The astonishing sales success comes a year after the game&#x27;s explosive February 2022 launch.


FromSoftware&#x27;s Elden Ring was an immediate smash hit, shifting 12m copies in just over two weeks. By the end of March, sales had hit 13.4m. It was 16.6m by August.

                              <span>There&#x27;s some good news if your Forza Horizon 5 experience is starting to get a little grey around the edges; Microsoft and developer Playground Games will be announcing the open-world racer&#x27;s next expansion this Thursday, 23rd February.


This mysterious new addition will be Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s second paid expansion, following on from last year&#x27;s Hot Wheels update. That introduced what Microsoft called the series&#x27; &quot;most extreme tracks ever devised&quot; high above Mexico, as well as ten new vehicles.


There&#x27;s no real hint as to what Playground Games has in store for expansion number 2 - I gave a quick squint at the reveal announcement art and came away none the wiser - but Microsoft previously said it would add &quot;a new location, vehicles, and gameplay&quot;. Or maybe when you fire it up, it&#x27;ll just promise to give you a copy of Call of Duty for the next ten years.

Story Packs, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, are mid-sized expansions designed to expand Stellaris&#x27; narrative potential, and First Contact will be game&#x27;s fifth, following on from Leviathans, Synthetic Dawn, Distant Stars, and Ancient Relics.


This time around, the focus is on the experiences of pre-FTL civilisations, both from their point of view and the perspective of their observers. To that end, First Contact introduces a revamped Observation system bringing in elements of civilisation Awareness, Diplomacy, and Espionage, plus Insights that can be learned by observing civilisations uncorrupted by the wider galaxy.

                              <span>EA and Omega Force have released a first, much-needed patch to improve the PC performance of their hugely enjoyable monster battler Wild Hearts - but early reports from players suggest it hasn&#x27;t actually managed to fix performance very much.


Word of Wild Hearts&#x27; performance woes began to spread even before its official release last week, when EA Play early access players started reporting everything from low frame-rates and persistent stuttering to sluggish pop-in across all platforms.
In response, Omega Force pledged to address performance concerns, saying it was &quot;working continuously to improve performance and optimise the game&quot; on all platforms, and that it would be releasing a PC patch this week to fix a CPU bottleneck problem it claimed should &quot;improve performance across mid-high end CPUs&quot;.

First up is developer Free Lives&#x27; gladiatorial smash-&#x27;em-up Gorn, which launches on 16th March. Also due in March is Nock: Bow + Arrow Soccer, which, as its name suggests, blends archery and football for a spot of &quot;high-stakes&quot; sports action.


Next on the list is Arizona Sunshine studio Vertigo Games&#x27; Hellsweeper VR, an &quot;intense VR experience where earthly physics do not exist and gravity-defying movements become your new reality&quot;. This one&#x27;s coming &quot;later this year&quot;.

The announcement was made during a press conference in Brussels this evening that followed a hearing at the European Commission in which Microsoft made its case for the deal to regulators.

                              <span>Microsoft is holding a press briefing in Brussels to address the future of its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard buyout attempt, due to begin at 5.45pm UK time. 


This evening&#x27;s briefing follows an crucial day in court for the company, as it sought to settle anti-trust concerns raised by the EU&#x27;s European Commission, one of several regulators around the world currently standing in the way of the buyout being allowed to go ahead as-is. 


Sony and other companies with an interest in the deal were also part of today&#x27;s court session - a closed hearing in which media were not allowed to attend. Join us now for live updates on how Microsoft frames the day - and what might be next for Xbox&#x27;s potentially industry-shaking deal.

                              <span>Sony has announced the first State of Play broadcast of 2023, set for this Thursday, 23rd February at 9pm UK time.


In a blog post, Sony outlined what fans can expect from the show, which features a deep dive into Rocksteady&#x27;s upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and the reveal of five upcoming PSVR2 games.


It sounds like this State of Play won&#x27;t go big on first-party PlayStation 5 games, however.

Mighty Doom is a cartoony top-down single-touch shooter featuring the new Mini Slayer character.


It&#x27;s set in the &quot;animated Doom universe&quot;, which I did not know was a universe until today.

                              <span>Blumhouse Productions - the movie company behind some of the last two decades&#x27; biggest horror movie hits - is establishing a new gaming division focused on publishing indie horror games for PC, consoles, and mobile.


Since its formation in 2000, Blumhouse Productions has been the brains behind a steady stream of successful horror movies and franchises - including Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, The Purge, and Get Out - and the company is now looking to bring its horror expertise to video games, with the creation of Blumhouse Games.


This new division will partner with independent game developers to produce and publish &quot;original, horror-themed games for console, PC and mobile audiences&quot; (thanks BloodyDisgusting), and will adopt a similar low-budget model to that of its movie wing, targeting titles with sub-$10m budgets.

Now, say what you want about AWS&#x27;s hiring practices, they certainly don&#x27;t hire people who aren&#x27;t intelligent. This intelligent person made the very reasonable determination that the best solution they had available to send me that half terabyte of data was to mail me a hard drive.

                              <span>Capcom has announced a $1m first prize for an upcoming Street Fighter 6 tournament.


The impressive cash win is part of a $2m prize pool for the next Capcom Pro Tour. It&#x27;s the biggest prize pool the series has ever seen, and probably the biggest single cash prize in fighting game history.


To put this into context, the prize pool for the 2022 Pro Tour and its final tournament, Capcom Cup 9, was just $300,000. Clearly, Capcom is throwing its weight behind Street Fighter 6, which doesn&#x27;t come out until 2nd June.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 11 fans have found a fun Easter egg nearly four years after the game launched.


This Easter egg hunt was kicked off by Aaron Davis, senior designer at NetherRealm Studios, in a tweet published in 2020.


&quot;For people who like hidden stuff in MK games, there&#x27;s something in MK11 I put in that hasn&#x27;t been found yet from what I can tell,&quot; Davis wrote.

At the time of launch for PS Plus, Sony stated the addition of trophy support for games in the Classic catalogue would be &quot;optional for developers&quot;. Since then, only some games have included trophies, although Super Stardust Portable was recently the first game to have trophies added retroactively.



Legend of Dragoon includes 47 trophies, including a coveted platinum, most of which are tied to story.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced it has finalised a 10-year agreement to launch Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms on &quot;the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity&quot;. 


The move is, of course, reliant on Microsoft&#x27;s precarious-looking $68.7bn deal to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard going through.


It&#x27;s not the first time we&#x27;ve heard of such an agreement. Indeed, Xbox boss Phil Spencer first mentioned a 10-year &quot;commitment&quot; with Nintendo for Call of Duty back in December. Microsoft has also tried to offer the same decade-long deal to PlayStation in a bid to calm its concerns over Xbox owning Activision Blizzard - but with little success.

                              <span>Developer IronOak Games has teased a little more of For the King 2 - the sequel to its wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure - with its latest trailer revealing a handful of new features including landboats and recruitable pets.


The original For The King was a bit of a treat, blending familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - into a light-hearted, optionally co-operative rogue-like adventure with some neat story generation through its myriad randomised narrative events.


Much of that core remains in place in For The King 2, but the sequel - which pits players against the kingdom of Fahrul&#x27;s tyrannical queen 20 years after the end of the first game - adds new biomes, expanded co-op for up to four players (now also available online), increased customisaton across classes, armour, and weapons, plus a new, more strategic lane-based combat system which is detailed more thoroughly here.

                              <span>Square Enix has pledged to finally address issues affecting its wonky Chrono Cross remaster, known as The Radical Dreamers Edition, in a new patch arriving this month - almost a year after its initial release on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.


Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition launched last April, offering players a gentle remaster of Square&#x27;s dimension-hopping 1999 PlayStation JRPG Chrono Cross, in which a teenage boy named Serge finds himself in an alternate reality where he died as a child.


While the game itself has been celebrated over the years - Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell called it an &quot;engrossing epic, mixing sadness, whimsy and a touch of cosmic dread&quot; when he reviewed The Radical Dreamers Edition last year - the remaster left a lot to be desired, with Digital Foundry coming away unimpressed by its performance on all platforms.

                              <span>Bloober Team has announced a June launch window for Layers of Fear - the Layers of Fear 1 &amp; 2 remake formally known as Layers of Fears - and shared a new trailer to coincide with the news.


Layers of Fear is being co-developed with Anshar Studios, and sees the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 for a spot of new-gen shininess, and reimagined as a single, generations-spanning &quot;psychedelic horror chronicle&quot;.


The first Layers of Fear game, which released back in 2016, charted the story of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece, while 2019&#x27;s Layers of Fear 2 told the tale of an actor making a movie onboard a labyrinthine ocean liner. Bloober&#x27;s remake(s) will revisit each protagonist&#x27;s respective unravellings, bringing new visuals, gameplay, and expanded plot lines said to &quot;cast a new light on the overarching narrative&quot;.

When questioned whether Ubisoft would be at E3 this year, Guillemot raised eyebrows by telling investors his company would be there &quot;if E3 happens&quot;. 


Ubisoft has now confirmed in a statement to GamesIndustry.biz that it will be in attendance with a &quot;strong line-up&quot; at E3 - which is being run for the first time this year by Eurogamer parent company Reedpop.

                              <span>The Intercept has a long article on the insecurity of photo cropping:
One of the hazards lies in the fact that, for some of the programs, downstream crop reversals are possible for viewers or readers of the document, not just the file’s creators or editors. Official instruction manuals, help pages, and promotional materials may mention that cropping is reversible, but this documentation at times fails to note that these operations are reversible by any viewers of a given image or document.
[…]
Uncropped versions of images can be preserved not just in Office apps, but also in a file’s own metadata. A photograph taken with a modern digital camera contains all types of metadata. Many image files record text-based metadata such as the camera make and model or the GPS coordinates at which the image was captured. Some photos also include binary data such as a thumbnail version of the original photo that may persist in the file’s metadata even after the photo has been edited in an image editor...</span>

                              <span>Lego has begun removing videos uploaded to YouTube which discuss a rumoured Legend of Zelda set, details of which have trickled out over the past few months. 


The rumoured set is said to feature the series&#x27; iconic Deku Tree, along with minifigures for Link and Zelda.


Images said to be of the set appeared online earlier this month, though their legitimacy could not be proven. Now, Lego has begun issuing copyright claims on YouTube videos discussing the set - a move seen to be confirmation the set is indeed real.

                              <span>Soviet city-builder PC game Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic has been struck by a DMCA copyright violation issued by an angry fan.


As a result, the game from Slovakian developer 3Division is currently unavailable to purchase on Steam and does not appear in searches, though is still playable by those who have already purchased it.


The claim has been made by a fan of the game who wanted to be included in the game&#x27;s credits, but has since gone rogue.

                              <span>The Last of Us episode six, known as &quot;Kin&quot;, reunites us with Joel and Ellie as they continue their search for Tommy and the Fireflies. 


After a definite pick up in action and episode five&#x27;s emotional finale, episode six reverts back to a slightly slower pace of storytelling with a heavier focus on character development and world building. 


The bulk of the episode once again uses Naughty Dog&#x27;s source material as a flexible framework - it remains true to the game&#x27;s core narrative, but adjusts and embellishes certain aspects of its story.

The entire book has been scanned and is now available to view online, after initially being posted on reddit. We won&#x27;t post the artwork here.


While there are no massive spoilers to be wary of, Zelda fans looking to experience Tears of the Kingdom completely blind should keep an eye out where they click from here on out.

The game has players controlling the infamous puppet - presumably shortened to P here - in a dark gothic setting that many have likened to Bloodborne.


The release announcement was made at IGN&#x27;s Fan Fest 2023, with a new trailer showing off the creation of some sort of robotic monstrosity.

That&#x27;s right. Just as we&#x27;re recovering from the grizzlies in Elden Ring, PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton is welcoming a &quot;lumbering pack of malice&quot;, too - polar bears.

&quot;Bears have moved onto Vikendi&#x27;s icy battlegrounds but they’re sheltering from the blizzard and hibernating for winter,&quot; the team teases. &quot;Players can invade their caves for valuable loot, but we all know what happens when you poke a sleeping bear.&quot;

The Anti-Theft Mode feature will make the devices invisible to Scan and Secure, the company’s in-app feature that lets you know if any nearby Tiles are following you. But to activate the new Anti-Theft Mode, the Tile owner will have to verify their real identity with a government-issued ID, submit a biometric scan that helps root out fake IDs, agree to let Tile share their information with law enforcement and agree to be subject to a $1 million penalty if convicted in a court of law of using Tile for criminal activity. So although it technically makes the device easier for stalkers to use Tiles silently, it makes the penalty of doing so high enough to (at least in theory) deter them from trying...</span>

                              <span>Octopath Traveler 2 is giving you the chance to try before you buy courtesy of a new free-to-play demo.

The demo - which lets you carry your progress over to the full game - allows you to explore &quot;corners of Solistia to your heart&#x27;s content&quot;, provided you can get all of your exploring done within three hours – yes, there&#x27;s a three-hour time limit. 

That said, there are eight protagonists to choose from, so once you hit your three-hour limit, you&#x27;ll be able to start over again for another three hours with a different character. Just make sure you don&#x27;t overwrite the progress you make with your favourite character.

&quot;We are working to reform our various personnel systems so that employees can maximise their respective potential in a comfortable working environment,&quot; Sega said (thanks, NME).

                              <span>Tencent - one of the world&#x27;s biggest game publishers - has scaled back plans to take on the metaverse with its own VR hardware.

According to a new report by Reuters, the Chinese company is set to trim back its plans and personnel by &quot;cut[ting] costs and headcount&quot; at its &quot;extended reality&quot; XR unit. It&#x27;s unclear how this will impact the 300 employees currently working in the department, which was only set up in June last year.

Whilst Tencent isn&#x27;t talking publicly about the changes beyond admitting that it was &quot;making adjustments to some business teams&quot;, sources close to the situation report that part of the issue is the lengthy process of making hardware profitable. Internal forecasting reportedly confirmed that developing and selling its own VR system is unlikely to become profitable for Tencent until 2027.

The update addresses a number of issues, including the grass draw distance on Epic Particle settings that Digital Foundry&#x27;s Alex recently reported. It also fixes the &quot;rare issue&quot; with music stopping during Biome entry, as well as problems with incorrectly detecting Ultrawide monitor setups and Windows resolutions on the first boot, too.

You should also find that the PSN sign-in time outs have also been fixed, along with Benchmark results rounding error.

                              <span>Ubisoft has peeled back the lid on Rainbow Six siege&#x27;s Year 8 Season 1, Operation Commanding Force, which introduces new features, a new Operator, and &quot;further anti-toxicity measures&quot;.

The new season also ushers in the game&#x27;s all-new Mousetrap feature, which means players jumping onto console when using a mouse and keyboard will &quot;activate a penalty that adds lag to their inputs&quot;.

&quot;The goal of this penalty is to encourage fair gameplay by removing the unfair advantage that mouse and keyboard players have on consoles,&quot; Ubisoft explains. &quot;While active, continued use of mouse and keyboard gradually increases the lag over several matches, making it harder to aim and shoot. Completing matches with a controller will gradually reduce the lag back to normal.&quot;

Diablo 4&#x27;s open beta and early access are split across two weekends, starting with early access from 17th to 19th March. This session is exclusive to players that pre-purchase Diablo 4, while the open beta - which runs from 24th to 26th March - will be available to everyone.


Blizzard says the two sessions will offers players a &quot;deep look into the early game including the Prologue and the entirety of Act 1&quot;, and a level cap of 25 will be in place. More details are set to be shared during a developer livestream scheduled for 28th February.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but acclaimed viking survival adventure Valheim finally has a release date on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass, with developer Iron Gate Studios confirming it&#x27;ll be hitting Microsoft&#x27;s console on 14th March.


Valheim, of course, took the PC gaming world by storm when it launched into Steam early access back in February 2021, selling 4m copies in just three weeks and nearly 7m by July that same year. Despite its huge success, Iron Gate has continued to take its time with Valheim, and it wasn&#x27;t until November last year that the game received the first of several promised biome expansions in the form of Mistlands.


As such, there&#x27;s a long way to go until Valheim is ready for its 1.0 release, and the studio recently confirming its next biome expansion, the volcanic Ashalnds, is still in &quot;pre-production&quot;.

                              <span>Tetris Effect: Connected - the multiplayer-enhanced version of Eurogamer&#x27;s Game of the Year 2018 - is getting four new game modes next week as part of its Winter Update.


Tetris Effect, if it&#x27;s somehow escaped you, takes the classic block-dropping action of the seminal puzzler and cranks up the hypnotic allure by turning the whole thing into a shimmering, pulsating light and sound show in which everything syncs to the gorgeous music.


Tetris Effect: Connected became the de facto version in 2021, chucking in cross-platform multiplayer support for competitive and co-op play as it made the jump to non-VR devices, and the game is set to expand a little further with the aforementioned new modes next week.

                              <span>Strategy focused developer Firaxis has confirmed it&#x27;s working on a new entry in its long-running Civilization series, with the announcement arriving alongside the news that XCOM and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns designer Jake Solomon is leaving the studio after 23 years.


The announcement comes as Firaxis promotes Heather Hazen, previously the its chief operating officer, to the position of studio head. Hazen replaces Steve Martin, who served as Firaxis&#x27; president and studio head for nearly 17 years.


In a statement accompanying the news, Hazen said, &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled to have this opportunity to carry on the studio&#x27;s storied legacy, beginning with the announcement that Firaxis is in development on the next iteration of the legendary Civilization.&quot; Details on the project are thin, but the developer has confirmed Ed Beach, who lead the design of 2016&#x27;s Civilization 6, will serve as creative director on the new game.

                              <span>Last year, it was announced Liam Hemsworth would be taking over the role of Geralt from Superman actor Henry Cavill for the fourth season of Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher adaptation.


This turn of events took many by surprise, especially given Cavill&#x27;s clear passion for the series&#x27; source material. Some still find it hard to believe that the season three finale will be the last time we see Cavill straddling Roach and riding off into the sunset (or some sort of equivalent, this is The Witcher after all).


However, thanks to a recent deepfake video, we can get a better idea of how Hemsworth will look in his new The Witcher role.

The Far Northern Attire is an in-game costume consisting of headpiece, tunic, gloves, bottoms and boots, available to purchase in the game&#x27;s online store for £11.16.


However, the Saami Council has claimed the outfit uses the cultural property of the Sámi - a group of indigenous people from parts of northern Scandinavia.

                              <span>In a time where it seems every video game under the sun is getting its own adaptation of some sort, be it live-action TV series, full feature film or an episodic anime, we now have our first look at yet another one. And, you could say, things are falling into place for this particular film.


Tetris, starring Kingsman&#x27;s Taron Egerton, is an origin story for the game. It is inspired by true events, and follows the story of Henk Rogers, the man that &quot;risked his life to outsmart the KGB and turn Tetris into a worldwide sensation&quot;. The upcoming film takes place in 1988 when Rogers first discovers Tetris and &quot;risks everything by travelling to the Soviet Union&quot;. Here, he teams up with Tetris&#x27; creator Alexey Pajitnov (played by The Thaw&#x27;s Nikita Efremov) &quot;to bring the game to the masses&quot;. 


If you had told me this was actually going to be a thing a few days ago I would have scoffed, however having seen the trailer for it I have to say, it looks kind of great (also, I am a sucker Europe&#x27;s &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, which features heavily in the trailer). You can see what you think about it for yourself via the video below.

Flights made by a private jet owned by Sony have been used to back up suggestion of a meeting between Sony executives and Microsoft in early February. 


Publicly available flight information shows a Sony jet flying from London to Seattle, where Microsoft is headquartered, around a month ago, for the first such visit in over 18 months, before travelling on to LA.

                              <span>Sherlock Holmes The Awakened, from Ukrainian studio Frogwares, has been delayed due to the ongoing war in the country.


Originally aiming for a late February or early March release date, the studio is now targeting a release of late March / early April.


While development of the game has been particularly challenging since April 2022, it&#x27;s been especially difficult during the winter. The studio released a video update in December depicting life in Ukraine during the ongoing war.

                              <span>Nintendo 3DS and Wii U owners have just over a year to transfer any remaining funds from their eShop wallets into their Nintendo Account, the company has now confirmed. 


As a reminder, the 3DS and Wii U eShops will effectively shut down from 27th March, leaving you unable to spend any remaining balance you might still  have. 


However, this balance will be transferrable to your Nintendo Account for use on Switch - up until March 2024 (as spotted by Nintendo Life).

                              <span>A new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet software update, known as version 1.2.0, will be released later this month.

As previously announced, this update is due to arrive towards the &quot;end of February&quot;, although there is no firm date as yet. It is set to add &quot;features to Pokémon Boxes&quot; and address a variety of bugs that &quot;affect game progress&quot; in both Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, among other things.


These include fixes for those rogue Poké Balls that were sometimes displayed in certain locations of the field unintentionally and an issue that meant the main character&#x27;s expressions did not change until a user&#x27;s game was closed and then reopened.

During the meeting Ybarra was asked several pre-screened questions on its supposed use of stack ranking for employee performance, the slashing of profit-share bonuses for 2022, and the announcement employees will be required to return to office working.


However, Blizzard employees soon took to social media after the meeting to express their outrage at Ybarra&#x27;s comments.

                              <span>A group of games industry veterans - consisting most prominently of former Respawn Entertainment developers with credits on the likes of Titanfall and Apex Legends - have teamed up to form new &quot;remote first&quot; studio Wildlight Entertainment.


Wildlight has been founded by Dusty Welch and Jason McCord (who&#x27;ll act as CEO and design director respectively), with Chad Grenier serving as studio head and game director. Grenier was previously game director on Respawn&#x27;s hugely popular battle royale shooter Apex Legends before leaving the studio after more than a decade at the end of last year.


Grenier is joined by another high-profile former Respawn team member, Mohammad Alavi, who&#x27;s design credits include Infinity Ward&#x27;s original Modern Warfare series and Titanfall. Prior to his departure from Respawn in 2021, Alavi was working on an unnamed &quot;single-player adventure&quot; - a reportedly now-canned project set in the Titanfall/Apex Legends universe.

                              <span>In the run-up to next week&#x27;s launch of Yakuza samurai spin-off Like a Dragon: Ishin, Sega has released a two-part combat demo for Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam.


Like a Dragon: Ishin, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, originally released for PlayStation 3 and PS4 in Japan (under the name Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!) back in 2014, transplanting the chaotic open-world Yakuza formula to the Late Edo Period for a historical slice of samurai action.


That action follows protagonist Sakamoto Ryōma as he returns to his home in Tosa where, after a run-in with a high-ranking samurai, he&#x27;s sentenced to be executed. Thankfully for both Ryōma and the game&#x27;s run-time, that particular crisis is averted, and our lead embarks on a quest through 1860s Kyo that blends story, action, and mini-games in much the same vein as Yakuza.

And ahead of that, publisher 2K has launched another free trial across all platforms, plus discounts on the base game.


Venom will be the second DLC character to join Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns&#x27; original playable superhero line-up - consisting of Blade, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Hulk, Iron Man, Magik, Nico Minoru, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, and Wolverine - following on from the addition of Deadpool last month.


Venom&#x27;s DLC release, titled Redemption, includes three new story missions continuing on from those seen in Deadpool&#x27;s DLC, new skins and outfits, plus a new Research project known as Whisper Web, said to expand the tactical options for the Intel resource. Redemption will be available to purchase separately or as part of the Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns Season Pass, included in the Legendary Edition. Two more DLC characters - Morbius and Storm - are still to come.

                              <span>Bungie&#x27;s eye-catching new Destiny 2 cinematic arrived this week to cap off the game&#x27;s current Season 19 in style. 


Perhaps more excitingly, the trailer successfully hypes up both the impending arrival of Destiny 2&#x27;s Lightfall expansion at the end of the month, as well as the fact Bungie is finally bringing its overarcing 10-year narrative to a long-awaited finale.


I&#x27;ve previously put hundreds and hundreds of hours into the original Destiny and its sequel, but in recent years just kept up with its story, unable to devote the time required to keep up with the game itself each week. Even for someone like me, this new video has plenty to get excited about.

                              <span>The Legend of Dragoon is on its way to PlayStation Plus, marking the first time the JRPG has been available digitally in Europe.


First released in Japan in 1999 for the PlayStation 1, The Legend of Dragoon was later released in North America (2000) and Europe (2001), followed by a release as a PlayStation Classic on the PlayStation Network for PS3 and PSP in Japan and America - but not Europe.


As a result, the game has taken on cult classic status and is hard to come by, with original physical copies of the game available on eBay for upwards of £150 - £200.

This should include encouragement to take regular breaks from extended play &quot;without feeling pressurised to continue playing or becoming fearful of missing out&quot;, the ICO continued. 


While the report only offers recommendations, they are being made as part of the UK&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Code, which explains how the UK&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation (the dreaded GDPR) should be applied to digital services.

The news comes from the latest financial report from the publisher, which boasts a 128 percent increase in net sales across the company.


Little is known about these five Lord of the Rings games, although the report notes that the acquisition of Middle-Earth Enterprises has &quot;generated a lot of interest among both internal and external partners for the Lord of the Rings IP, across different media formats&quot;.

You now have the chance to play the game for three hours, which will give you a little taster of what&#x27;s in store for Kratos and Atreus as they negotiate the perils of the nine mythological Norse realms.



This trial made its debut in North America earlier this week, but it is now available for those of us in Europe as well.

Apex Legends&#x27; previous peak concurrent player count on Steam was in August 2022, when just over 500,000 players were online for Season 14, Hunted.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley gets its next major update today, which adds Olaf from Frozen, Mirabel from Encanto, and also extends the game&#x27;s ongoing storyline. 


Patch notes for the update released today also reveal the addition of a premium shop, which will see &quot;rotating cosmetic items like clothing, furniture, premium house skins and more&quot;. 


You won&#x27;t find this stuff elsewhere, such as at Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s General Store, and you&#x27;ll only be able to buy these things using the Moonstone currency - previously used to unlock the premium season pass reward track.

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s new &quot;carbon aware&quot; energy saving feature - which launched for Insider testing last month - is now available to everyone as part of the console&#x27;s February update.


Essentially, Xbox&#x27;s new energy saving feature allows a console - provided it&#x27;s connected to the internet and has access to regional carbon intensity data - to schedule game, app, and OS updates at time a higher proportion of electricity is coming from lower-carbon sources on the electric grid. Microsoft says this decreases fossil fuel dependency and CO2 emissions and could potentially saves users money. 


Additionally, Microsoft once again highlights Xbox&#x27;s Shutdown (energy saving) mode in its February update blog post, claiming it cuts power use by up to 20x compared to the Sleep power option. Shutdown mode was enabled automatically during recent Insider testing, but it&#x27;s not clear whether this is the case for general release.

                              <span>Valentine&#x27;s Day has been and gone but Warframe is still in a romantic mood, charting a love affair across the Void in its new Citrine&#x27;s Last Wish update, out today on all platforms.


Among the various additions introduced in Citrine&#x27;s Last Wish are new Mirror Defence missions, described as &quot;classic defence missions with a twist&quot;. This latest challenge type, found at the new Tyana Pass node, sees Tenno battling an onslaught of tough enemies determined to harness the power of two crystal-encased lovers, lost to time and space, for themselves. 


&quot;In response to the connection between Belric and Rania,&quot; explains developer Digital Extremes, &quot;The Void has bored a hole in space to connect their preserved bodies for eternity.&quot; As such, players will need to fend off Grineer and Corpus as they defend Rania&#x27;s crystal on Mars and Belric&#x27;s crystal on Venus in order to reunite the pair.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re not a PlayStation Plus subscribers but have always been faintly curious about what life might be like for those on the other side, now&#x27;s your chance to get some answers courtesy of Sony&#x27;s imminent free PlayStation Plus online multiplayer weekend.


Sony&#x27;s promotion runs for 24 hours, starting this Saturday 18th February, and as with its previous similar events, anyone can put PlayStation 4 and 5&#x27;s online multiplayer through its paces during that time - teaming up with friends, strangers, or otherwise across all multiplayer-supporting games - without needing to cough up the usual fee.


What you will need, though, is a registered PSN account - oh, and you won&#x27;t get very far without an active internet connection and a game that supports online play.

According to internal Slack messages that were leaked to Insider, an Amazon lawyer told workers that they had “already seen instances” of text generated by ChatGPT that “closely” resembled internal company data.
This issue seems to have come to a head recently because Amazon staffers and other tech workers throughout the industry have begun using ChatGPT as a “coding assistant” of sorts to help them write or improve strings of code, the report notes.
[…]
“This is important because your inputs may be used as training data for a further iteration of ChatGPT,” the lawyer wrote in the Slack messages viewed by Insider, “and we wouldn’t want its output to include or resemble our confidential information.”...</span>

                              <span>Wild Hearts developer Omega Force has pledged to address performance issues reported by players taking advantage of EA&#x27;s 10-hour early access offer ahead of this Friday&#x27;s release.


Wild Hearts is, of course, Omega Force and publisher EA&#x27;s spin on Monster Hunter, setting players loose in the land of Azuma, a kind of fantastical feudal Japan, to bring down mighty Kemono - behemoths fused with nature. EA Play subscribers on all platforms have been able to access the game&#x27;s first ten hours since yesterday, but early reports have pointed to disappointing performance and visual concerns, especially on PC.


PC players have reported the likes of lower-than-anticipated performance even on hardware well above EA&#x27;s recommended specs, as well persistent stutter regardless of settings and resolution. I&#x27;ve been playing the Origin version with an RTX 3070 for review, and have experienced both issues first-hand.

                              <span>With the launch of Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare 2 Season 2 today, Activision has teased what&#x27;s coming next in both a mid-season update and in the next season.


First off, Season 2 Reloaded adds a brand new core 6v6 multiplayer map for Modern Warfare 2. We know nothing about it, but we do have the image below to whet our appetites:


The addition of a brand new 6v6 map to Modern Warfare 2 will be welcomed by fans who feel the game has suffered from a lack of content in comparison to Call of Duty&#x27;s extraction mode DMZ and battle royale Warzone 2.0. Indeed, Modern Warfare 2 players reacted negatively when Activision revealed Season 2 includes two &quot;new&quot; maps: Dome and Valderas Museum. Dome is a remake of Dome from Infinity Ward&#x27;s 2011 game Modern Warfare 3, and Valderas Museum was playable in the MW2 beta before failing to make the launch for some reason.

                              <span>If you are in the US and fancy going against the grain for your Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom pre-ordering, GameStop is giving away a free wooden plaque if you shop with them.


Admittedly, this in itself isn&#x27;t really all that interesting. If you, like me, live in the UK then this deal is out of reach (for now at least, I will keep an eye out for it appearing at any local retailers). However, being the Zelda fan that I am, I have been taking a closer look at the plaque to see if it gives us any more clues about Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s story. 


On further investigation, I noticed the artwork depicted on the plaque is the same that can be seen adorning the Tears of the Kingdom artbook that comes with the game&#x27;s collectors edition, and can also be found on the game&#x27;s Japanese website. So, it is clearly important.

                              <span>Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, the latest spin-off from developer Riot Games&#x27; Riot Forge label, has been officially revealed following its leak last month, with a release now pencilled in for &quot;spring&quot; 2023 on PC and unspecified consoles.


Mageseeker will be the third release in Riot Forge&#x27;s A League of Legends Story spin-off series - arriving after Airship Syndicate&#x27;s acclaimed RPG Ruined King and BIT.TRIP creator Choice Provisions&#x27; puzzler Hextech Mayhem - and it&#x27;s something entirely different again, this time moving into the realm of gritty &quot;2D hi-bit pixel action-RPG&quot;.


Set in Demacia - a mighty kingdom that seeks to curtail what it considers to be forbidden magic - Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story casts players as Sylas, an escaped mage &quot;whose quest for vengeance will shatter Demacia&#x27;s deceptive peace&quot;. It&#x27;s described as an &quot;action-packed fantasy gameplay experience&quot; framed by a story of &quot;power, identity, and justice&quot;.

The project was first announced last November as an NFT project to mark a &quot;new franchise&quot;. At the start of this year, the company once again stated its intention to release blockchain games.




Now we know what Symbiogenesis will be: an &quot;interactive Web3 digital collectible art experience&quot; on the Polygon blockchain.

The financial scheme, founded by the country&#x27;s highly-controversial ruling Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now owns 7.08 percent of Nintendo, up from 6.07 percent in January, Trading View revealed today (thanks, VGC). 


The PIF was previously known to have acquired a 5.01 percent stake in the company as of May 2021. The quick addition of more highlights the fund&#x27;s growing stake in Nintendo - and many other video game companies -  gathering pace.

Admittedly, Rhianna did come close with her recent Super Bowl staging, but the distinct lack of Nintendo IP was a little disappointing.


Well, today I learned Nintendo actually did host its own real-life Smash Bros. event, sort of. There were no cosmic powers and elaborate stages, but even so, they still got Mario to wrestle Pikachu, Donkey Kong and Yoshi.


Back in 1999, Nintendo hosted Slamfest &#x27;99 in the MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park in Las Vegas to promote the upcoming Smash Bros. release for N64. The company hired actors to dress up as key characters from Nintendo history, and let them loose in a wrestling ring. Yes, actually.
