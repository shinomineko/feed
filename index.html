                              <span>Point-and-click specialist Wadjet Eye Games - the studio behind the acclaimed likes of Unavowed and the celebrated Blackwell series - is teaming up with  indie studio Cloak and Dagger Games to publish its forthcoming folk horror adventure The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow on PC, Mac, and Linux later this year.


While the name might not be familiar, Cloak and Dagger Games has been steadily making a name for itself in the point-and-click genre over the last half-decade with a series of idiosyncratic short-form adventures, primarily within the realm of horror. A few of them, including deliciously creepy early title A Date in the Park, with its expert ratcheting of unease, can be played for free. 


The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow is Cloak and Dagger&#x27;s first new title since 2019&#x27;s Lovecraft-inspired freebie The Terrible Old Man, and follows the Victorian-era adventure of antiquarian and author Thomasina Bateman as she arrives in the remote village of Bewlay after receiving a mysterious summons concerning its ancient barrows.

The mod ban accompanies the integration of Easy Anti-Cheat in an attempt to combat &quot;malicious modded clients&quot;.


The latest debacle began earlier this week, when VRChat announced the ban and the inclusion of Easy Anti-Cheat, as well as an open beta beginning immediately to test the update. On Discord, VRChat staff member Tupper revealed they expected the update to be rolled out to all players within 24 hours.

FIFA 23 has certain features on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, PC (finally!) and Google Stadia that are not present on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.


(I&#x27;m leaving out the Nintendo Switch version here because, as we know, it&#x27;s yet another &quot;Legacy Edition&quot;.)

                              <span>The Nintendo Switch Online app has a new update, which lets you send friend requests from your phone.
Adding friends on Nintendo Switch has always been slightly cumbersome, but Nintendo has made a step towards making the process a bit more streamlined on its app.
You can now send friend requests from within the app by typing in a friend code, nicely complementing the update from March we reported on that allowed users to easily copy their friend code. Alternatively, you can get your friend code as a URL or QR code, which can then be used by someone else to send you a friend request.

The report centres on changes within Rockstar since the company&#x27;s public reckoning with crunch in 2018, when founder Dan Houser said his team had worked &quot;100-hour weeks&quot; to finish Red Dead Redemption 2, and after various reports of the company&#x27;s frat-house-style operation. 


Subsequent changes to working styles and benefits are part of an attempt to &quot;reinvent&quot; the company as a more progressive workplace, the report states, which also extends to the content featured in its games.

As noticed by NME, Evolve: Stage 2 players are now able to matchmake and join peer-to-peer multiplayer games online once more.


This change has come thanks to a fan-made Discord channel for the game, which reached out to publisher 2K in a bid to find out more about its decision to close the servers down (something that happened all the way back in 2018).

                              <span>Microsoft is testing a new set of logos that will appear as &quot;badges&quot; over titles in your game library. 


These badges are already used to denote titles available via Xbox Game Pass, or that have Xbox Series X/S-specific features. 


New badges are being tested for other game conditions, so you can see at a glance what you have available to play. For example, a new logo will appear over games that are disc installs where that disc isn&#x27;t currently inserted - perhaps it&#x27;s around a friend&#x27;s? Or down the back of the sofa?

The developer revealed its removal yesterday, stating that this is all is due to a &quot;licensing issue&quot;. 


Instead, the company has now added a &quot;replacement default sound&quot;.

                              <span>Stephane D&#x27;Astous, founder and former boss of Deus Ex developer Eidos Montreal, has described Square Enix&#x27;s handling of its Western studios as a &quot;train wreck in slow motion&quot; in an explosive new interview. 


Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, D&#x27;Astous criticised Square Enix&#x27;s past management of its various Western studios and suggested the recent sale of Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics could have been motivated by a desire to court a buyout by PlayStation.


&quot;It was a trajectory that could be predicted,&quot; D&#x27;Astous said, discussing the decline of Square Enix&#x27;s Western studios, and Eidos Montreal in particular. &quot;I left because things were missing at head office. [Pre-Square Enix] Eidos has a great tradition of development teams, but they don&#x27;t have superior knowledge of how to sell their games. And that was quite clear.&quot;

                              <span>The mystery of the church and secret door in Nier: Automata continues.

Yesterday we reported how reddit user sadfutago posted a video entering a previously unfound door that led to an unseen church area, leaving dataminers scratching their heads. Is this truly a new secret in the game, or an elaborate modded hoax?



Even the team behind the game has shared the videos on Twitter, including the game&#x27;s creator Yoko Taro.

Both the 128GB and 256GB versions of the headset will rise in price by $100, Meta said in a statement last night, from $300 to $400, and from $400 to $500, respectively.


These are serious price increases - for the 128GB model, it represents a rise of 33 percent! - for hardware generally considered a good entry-level VR device.

These numbers currently put it ahead of other popular (although admittedly older) games such as Monster Hunter Rise, Destiny 2 and Fifa 22.

                              <span>Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake is &quot;in serious trouble&quot; and &quot;delayed indefinitely&quot;, according to a new report.

Bloomberg said developer Aspyr fired the game&#x27;s art director and design director this month, and told staff the hotly-anticipated remake is &quot;on pause&quot;.


The dramatic decision comes after Aspyr, which has been working on the game for three years, demoed a vertical slice to Lucasfilm and publisher Sony at the end of June. Apparently Aspyr bosses told staff this demo &quot;wasn&#x27;t where they wanted it to be&quot;.

                              <span>Good essay arguing that open-source software is a critical national-security asset and needs to be treated as such:
Open source is at least as important to the economy, public services, and national security as proprietary code, but it lacks the same standards and safeguards. It bears the qualities of a public good and is as indispensable as national highways. Given open source’s value as a public asset, an institutional structure must be built that sustains and secures it.
This is not a novel idea. Open-source code has been called the “roads and bridges”...</span>

The hugely-popular wrestler turned movie star will join Epic Games&#x27; battle royale as part of a WWE promotion that also emcompasses the publisher&#x27;s Rocket League and Fall Guys. 


Today&#x27;s announcement comes just days after former WWE boss Vince McMahon announced his retirement from the company, amidst multiple claims of sexual misconduct.

First up, we have a better look at Ambrose Island, Hitman 3&#x27;s new and free map. It&#x27;s a tropical romp full of sandy shores, lush vegetation... and more than just a few places to hide a body. Sounds right up 47&#x27;s street. The map will additionally bring new items for 47 to unlock, including a swashbuckling Kukri Machete, the Guerilla Wetsuit and a Molotov Cocktail to name a few.


IO has also revealed the opening cinematic for the Ambrose Island mission, which has some familiar faces as well as new targets within. You can see it for yourself below.

                              <span>Four WWE 2K games have been quietly removed from sale on Steam, video game sports fans have noticed. 


WWE 2K17, 2K18, 2K19 and 2K20 are all now missing from the Steam store on PC, and from both the PlayStation and Microsoft stores on consoles.


The move - which Steam-tracker suggests took place just over a week ago - leaves only the franchise&#x27;s more recent WWE 2K Battlegrounds and WWE 2K22 on sale (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Last week, Minecraft maker Mojang announced a firm ban on the use of NFTs within its hit sandbox game, to a warm response from many players.


The ban was seen by many fans as reactive - as some user-made projects have already used Minecraft to shift NFTs in the past. 


Now, one of the largest of those - NFT Worlds - has issued a response via Twitter, and said it would create &quot;a new game and platform&quot; instead (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Today we got a little bit more information about PlayStation VR2, Sony&#x27;s next foray into the world of virtual reality.
A new blog from PlayStation has detailed the user experience features available upon its release. 
These include a very useful looking see-through view and a customisable play area set up, among others.

                              <span>Thanks to the recent release of Stray, the internet is in no shortage of cat content. If this isn&#x27;t enough for you though (and let&#x27;s be frank, we could all do with more cats at all times), then you&#x27;re in luck.


Modder KangieDanie has uploaded a splitscreen multipawer - sorry, multiplayer - mod for PC that lets you play through the campaign in local co-op.  


KangieDanie notes that the mod is in very early development so if you decide to give it a try, you&#x27;re inevitably going to run into some bugs.

                              <span>On 26th September, World of Warcraft Classic players will be able to get their hands on the Wrath of the Lich King expansion (something that we kind of suspected already, as it was leaked ahead of time).
To accompany this official announcement, however, we also have a new trailer from Blizzard. Here, the gates to the frozen plains of Northrend are opened once again as battle ensues all around.
You can check it out for yourself below.

For members who pay monthly, you&#x27;ll pay a pound extra (£8.99 instead of £7.99, for a total of £107.88 a year). 


The rise follows a similar price hike by streaming rival Netflix back in March - its second in just 18 months. Both companies offer games as part of their subscriptions.

                              <span>Two Valorant players have been suspended from Riot-sanctioned esports competitions following an argument about in-game teabagging.


The news was shared on the Valorant site, stating that Dawn &quot;Dawn&quot; Park and Vivian &quot;Risorah&quot; Dela Cruz used vulgar language and harassed a member of the Galorants community.



Dawn has been suspended from competitions for three months; Risorah has been suspended for nine months.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a big new addition to Pokémon Go today, named Daily Adventure Incense. 


This free item will refresh each day and offer you 15 minutes of Pokémon spawns - as long as you keep walking. Included in the list of possible creatures are a long list of uncommon critters, evolved species and... the surprise debut of Galar&#x27;s Legendary bird trio from Pokémon Sword and Shield!


It&#x27;s worth noting these three have only a chance to appear, and even then have a low catch and high flee rate. Still, there are already plenty of reports of players successfully acquiring at least one of them, just 12 hours in.

Here, we get our first look at the dialogue options mechanic in-game (you can also see it on the Return to Monkey Island website when you chat to Stan), and meet the formidable Judge Plank. 


The clip starts by showing hero Guybrush Threepwood making his way along a snow-ridden and far from tropical street. Those icicles look like they could do some serious damage, and I am getting goose pimples just writing about them.

It&#x27;s been over 183 days since the servers were shut down following the discovery of a security issue in the multiplayer functionality affecting all three Dark Souls games on PC.


However, an update to the game on the SteamDB page suggests a solution could be on the way soon.

                              <span>A Nier: Automata player has stumbled upon a secret room in the game that&#x27;s remained undiscovered since its launch in 2017.


The discovery was made by reddit user sadfutago and has dataminers scratching their heads at how it was achieved.


Some spoilers for Nier: Automata follow.

                              <span>Earlier this month, Rockstar confirmed the end of any major support for Red Dead Online, with the developer shifting its focus to Grand Theft Auto 6. This left many cowboys disappointed (to put it mildly), to the extent an in-game funeral was held to mourn this loss.


While Rockstar may be jumping ship and swimming away from its Red Dead franchise, modders are not. In fact, a mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 will let you play as a totally new character of your own creation, give you a new skill tree to fill up and allow you to take on all-new heists. 
I appreciate I said &#x27;new&#x27; quite a lot there, but it fits the bill. This is no small undertaking by the modding community.

Born in Manchester in 1941, Warner developed a prolific acting career that stretched across seven decades and  spanned film, television, stage and video games.


On the big screen, Warner starred in movies such as Titanic, The Omen and Mary Poppins Returns. In 1981, he won an Emmy for his role in historical epic Masada.

It follows the disappearance of the store in several countries across mainland Europe, where a similar maintenance message popped up admitting downtime lasting &quot;a few weeks&quot; (thanks, Nintendo Life).


Nintendo has not given any further details of the maintenance it has planned, or why it is happening now.

Lockdown Mode offers an extreme, optional level of security for the very few users who, because of who they are or what they do, may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Turning on Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware...</span>

                              <span>If you found yourself suitably enthused for American Truck Simulator&#x27;s Montana expansion following last week&#x27;s 30 minutes of soothing cross-country trundling, there&#x27;s some great news; it turns out developer SCS Software was somewhat underselling it when it said development was &quot;slowly approaching the finish line&quot; - the Montana expansion is out next week.


Montana - which will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s tenth explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming - launches next Thursday, 4th August, giving players the chance to admire its &quot;glistening glacial lakes, snow-capped mountain peaks, blue-ribbon trout streams, and mighty Missouri, Yellowstone, and Flathead Rivers&quot;, all from behind the wheel.


Those curious for a glimpse at the routes American Truck Simulator&#x27;s Montana expansion will unlock can get a taste of the journeys ahead in SCS&#x27; newly updated map. Montana&#x27;s beautifully recreated landmarks also get an airing in the launch trailer below, but for a more genteel preview, SCS&#x27; wonderfully relaxing 30-minute sight-seeing tour is well worth your time.

                              <span>Ubisoft has responded to a recent report claiming Roller Champions will be winding down after its third season, insisting it &quot;isn&#x27;t getting cancelled&quot; and that it &quot;fully supports&quot; the project.


Word that Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play sports game was nearing the end of its life, despite only launching back in May, came via the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb during a segment on the Xbox Era podcast over the weekend.


In reponse, Ubisoft has now shared a statement on Twitter denying those claims and insisting &quot;Roller Champions isn&#x27;t getting cancelled. But while an imminent demise doesn&#x27;t currently appear to be on the cards, Ubisoft does say it will be extending Roller Champions&#x27; current season, Disco Fever, in order to &quot;focus on what our players have told us needs improvement&quot;.

                              <span>Daedalic Entertainment has delayed the launch of Lord of the Rings: Gollum once more, this time pushing its previously announced 1st September release back &quot;by a few months&quot;.


Lords of the Rings: Gollum was announced in March 2019, promising a Middle-Earth-inspired blend of &quot;subtle tactical stealth&quot;, environmental puzzling, climbing challenges, and &quot;fast-paced parkour action&quot;, all playing out across a mixture of open levels and more linear missions.


Daedelic was originally aiming to launch Gollum last year, but ultimately made the decision to delay its release into 2022, although no reason was given at the time. This latest delay, though, has been made in order to &quot;deliver the best possible experience&quot;, according to the developer.

                              <span>EA is reportedly the latest studio to get a slice of the Marvel action, with new claims suggesting it&#x27;s currently working on a new single-player, open-world game based on the Black Panther series.
That&#x27;s according to loose-lipped journalist Jeff Grubb who, speaking as part of Giant Bomb&#x27;s Game Mess Mornings stream, claimed the project will be single-player-only title, with EA&#x27;s aim being to build on the success of developer Respawn&#x27;s well-received solo adventure Jedi: Fallen Order.
While details are inevitably limited at this juncture - the title is said to be in &quot;very early development&quot; - Grubb claimed the basic premise is that players will need to complete various challenges in a bid to become the new Black Panther, following the death of an earlier incarnation at the start of the game.

                              <span>Roblox planned numerous concessions to Chinese state censorship and expected its game be hacked and cloned by Chinese companies as part of its launch in the country, an astonishing cache of leaked internal documents has revealed. 


The details, published by Vice, come from documents recently obtained by a hacker and held to ransom, before being posted online. Vice has said it has published these details to shine a light on the lengths that Western companies can be forced to go to if they decide to enter the Chinese market.


Revelations revealed in the report include instructions to Roblox employees in one internal presentation to &quot;expect that hacking has already started&quot; and that it would &quot;ramp up after a deal is signed, possibly even by [Roblox&#x27;s] partner&quot;.

                              <span>Stray may have only recently been released, but someone has already deciphered the game&#x27;s mysterious language. 
This language uses a substitution cipher to make the world in Stray more cryptic and mysterious. (A substitution cipher is a used to encrypt text by swapping each letter or symbol within said text with a different symbol, that can then be unscrambled with a key.)
And now, HalfGlassGaming&#x27;s Josh Wirtanen has cracked Stray&#x27;s cipher, and shared how we too can do the same (thanks, RockPaperShotgun). I have embedded some photos from the game within this article, so if you are yet to play or are keen to avoid spoilers, please take this as your cue to read something else on Eurogamer.

                              <span>Next year&#x27;s European TwitchCon event will be held in Paris.


It follows the recent TwitchCon Amsterdam event that saw nearly 14,500 people attend, an increase of 65 percent compared to the previous Berlin-held event in 2019.


That popularity is in part testament to the rise of the streaming platform during the pandemic, which now encompasses audiences far outside gaming.

The self-inflicted leak comes ahead of the newest episode of Stories from the Outlands, a series of animated shorts before each season that introduces the next Legend, which will be released at 4pm today.


Players who logged into the Apex Legends client on 23rd July may have spotted the preview image uploaded by Respawn. It&#x27;s since been removed from the client, but not before it could be immortalised on the internet.

While this on its own is not all that newsworthy, what makes these upcoming releases by Hasbro more interesting is that they give us all a look at Cal Kestis&#x27; new, and therefore older, image. This includes some impressively-manicured facial furniture. 
Cal&#x27;s beard is groomed impeccably on the soon-to-be-released model, making me wonder how he got such a close shave. Perhaps he took cutthroat shaving to the extreme and used his lightsaber for the job? Who can say, but he has certainly grown up since the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

Last week, several high-profile Fortnite leakers spread word that the game&#x27;s stars Joel and Ellie would be joining Epic&#x27;s infamous battle royale. 


But Druckmann has now poured cold water on the claims, calling them &quot;false rumours&quot;.

Funko has taken many of our beloved gaming heroes (as well as characters from other media) and given them a small-framed but massive-headed makeover. I, myself, have a Lara Croft one as part of my ever-growing Tomb Raider collection of &#x27;stuff&#x27;. 
Well, soon we will be seeing these diminutive, top-heavy, figurines in a whole new light, as a new partnership between Funko and Jon Burton&#x27;s 10.10 Games studio was announced at San Diego Comic-Con. This collaboration promises us &quot;AAA video games&quot; that will eventually head our way. 
You can watch the trailer - which features a guitar-loving and crown-wearing Funko called Freddy - for it all below.

A 3.5GB update was made available for the game earlier today, Eurogamer spotted. Now, developer Futurlab has confirmed this patch is designed to alleviate the game&#x27;s Xbox crash issues. 


Last week, Futurlab offered an unusual tip to avoid multiplayer crashes - to stop looking at the sun. Apparently, issues with the game&#x27;s lens flare visuals were at fault. (It&#x27;s also just good advice in general.)

The game&#x27;s creator Hideki Kamiya took to Twitter to dispute fan theories on the new mode that removes nudity from the game.


If anything, Nintendo actually wanted her Link outfit in previous games to be more revealing.

Yes, a new mod developed by Kirbymimi finally brings a split screen multiplayer experience to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The mod adds double the Links, double the fire power and, perhaps, double the fun.

                              <span>Stray has been out for almost a week, and inevitably the internet is modding the game&#x27;s playable cat-racter. Here&#x27;s some PC mods we&#x27;ve spotted that will give you paws for thought.


If you&#x27;re a dog person, you can play as a cute French bulldog puppy thanks to modder crubino. The Happy Puppy mod even changes most of the meows into woofs, and crubino hopes to add more to it, including customisation of the puppy&#x27;s fur. As a cat person, I think that&#x27;s barking mad...


Modder hibrietas provides a modern staple for mods, the Jason mod. Taken from the infamous mall scene in Heavy Rain, meowing is replaced with &quot;a pleading call to find your lost son, you terrible father&quot;.

                              <span>Among Us developer Innersloth has detailed some of the upcoming fixes and additions headed to its smash hit social game in the not-too-distant future. 


These changes will come separately and (it sounds like) ahead of the game&#x27;s next big feature update, which is set to add Hide &#x27;n&#x27; Seek gameplay later in 2022. 


Before that, handy features such as the ability to change the map in the lobby settings without having to leave and restart a new game will be added.

Players of the recent beta noticed matchmaking wasn&#x27;t available, but Xbox has confirmed to GamesRadar the feature won&#x27;t be in the final release.


&quot;Online matchmaking will not be available with final co-op,&quot; said an Xbox representative. &quot;We encourage you to continue to use the Halo LFG and the new Discord voice call feature on Xbox to find players to party up with as you continue playing the beta.&quot;

                              <span>Development on Ubisoft&#x27;s Roller Champions will reportedly be wound down following its third season.


The free-to-play sports game was released in May this year, but just months later will seemingly be canned.


That&#x27;s according to Giant Bomb journalist Jeff Grubb speaking on the Xbox Era podcast: &quot;Roller Champions is gonna be cancelled after Season 3,&quot; he said, reading out a message from a source.

The game&#x27;s PlayStation store page has since been updated, though, and now reads &quot;date to be determined&quot;, so watch this space.

                              <span>Ubisoft is now reportedly targeting a 2023 release window for its next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game, which is expected to be a smaller, stealth-focused edition of the series.


Codenamed Rift (though likely not its final title), this is the Baghdad-focused project which originally began life as a Valhalla expansion. It has since grown its own fully-fledged project, albeit tighter in scope than other recent, sprawling Assassin&#x27;s Creed entries.


Originally reported to arrive later this year (though still to be officially announced by Ubisoft itself), Bloomberg has now stated that Rift will arrive in either May or June 2023.

Sharing some gameplay on reddit, DanTheBloke (via exputer) explained that the latest update to Proton GE has allowed them to get online play for Halo Infinite working on their Steam Deck through the beta SteamOS.
DanTheBloke does say gameplay &quot;can be a little janky&quot; and there is &quot;some clipping audio at times&quot;. Regardless though, it is definitely still playable, as you can see for yourself below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a fair while since developer SCS Software revealed American Truck Simulator&#x27;s next destination would be Montana, but now, following regular progress reports on its blog, the studio has given us our best look yet at the forthcoming expansion, sharing a scenic 30-minute drive across the state in a lengthy new gameplay video.


Montana, which was confirmed to be in development last November, will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s tenth explorable state, joining California and Nevada (both of which were included at launch in 2016), alongside DLC additions Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming.


Setting the scene for its new expansion on Steam, SCS explains, &quot;Montana is a gateway to Glacier and Yellowstone - two crown jewels of the national park system - and is home to glistening glacial lakes, snow-capped mountain peaks, blue-ribbon trout streams, and mighty Missouri, Yellowstone, and Flathead Rivers.&quot;

                              <span>Gotham Knights, the upcoming game where you play as a bunch of Batman&#x27;s sidekicks, will get a six-issue comic book prequel starring the Dark Knight himself. 


The upcoming prequel comic, titled as Gotham Knights - Gilded City, focuses on Batman as he attempts to quell the spread of a rage-inducing virus infecting Gotham City (thanks, PopVerse).  


This case is being billed as Batman&#x27;s final mission before his apparently very much permanent demise, so there&#x27;s likely some interesting backstory here relevant to the game.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known for a while that knockabout battle royale game Fall Guys would be bringing back its ludicrous Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles outfits this August, but a new leak has indicated there may be considerably more to next month&#x27;s Sonic collaboration, with leakers having uncovered a new stage inspired the hedgehog&#x27;s classic Green Hill Zone.


A bean-ised Sonic the Hedgehog costume initially appeared in Fall Guys all the way back in October 2020, and Knuckles made his in-store debut in November the following year. Fall Guys then continued on its merry Sonic-free way, but last month&#x27;s Sonic Central livestream brought news that both character cosmetics would be returning to the game this August - as a sort of duel hoorah for Fall Guys&#x27; recent free-to-play launch and Sonic&#x27;s 30th birthday - bringing with them a newcomer in the form of Tails.


That seemed to be as far developer Mediatonic and Sega planned to take their latest collaboration, but players started to suspect their might be more to come around a week ago, when a screenshot looking an awful lot like a new Green Hill Zone stage was spotted as appearing (presumably unintentionally) as part of Fall Guys&#x27; &#x27;up next&#x27; stage select screen.

                              <span>Following reports earlier this year that Ubisoft was in the early stages of developing a sequel to its enjoyable Greek-mythology-themed open-world adventure Immortals Fenyx Rising, new claims have surfaced suggesting this may in fact be a spin-off, rather than a full-blown sequel, and one given a new Hawaiian Polynesian theme.


The original Immortals Fenyx Rising, which released in 2020, followed the adventures of the titular Fenyx after being washed ashore on the colourful Golden Isle, home to a pantheon of Greek mythology inspired gods. What followed was a generally enjoyable blend of open-world exploration, platforming, combat, and puzzling - all narrated by the perpetually bickering twosome of Prometheus and Zeus - whose biggest flaw (aside from its rather exhaustingly stuff-saturated map) was its over-familiarity.


&quot;Blame Covid, blame budgets, blame Ubisoft, blame the paradoxically thrifty, endlessly repurposing way the publisher makes all its huge, expansive, generous games,&quot; Christian Donlan wrote in his review, &quot;but Immortals never really finds its own voice until the very end.&quot;

But it was the event&#x27;s drag showcase that was really the talk of the convention. Capping off the first day, the TwitchCon Drag Showcase was the first event of its kind and saw over 60,000 people watching in the centre&#x27;s Glitch Theatre and streaming online - many of whom had never seen a drag show before.


Not only was the drag showcase the epicentre of LGBT+ representation at the convention, it was an opportunity to highlight the diversity of talent on Twitch. There&#x27;s far more to the platform than just playing video games, even if that&#x27;s done in makeup and a wig.

This contrasts with the official reasoning given by Chinese developer and publisher NetEase in June, which said it was holding back the game&#x27;s launch for &quot;content enhancement&quot;.


NetEase declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.

Speaking on Twitter, Sweeney re-iterated Epic&#x27;s previous stance that the company would not block games that include NFTs based on that issue alone. 


&quot;Developers should be free to decide how to build their games, and you are free to decide whether to play them,&quot; Sweeney wrote, &quot;I believe stores and operating system makers shouldn&#x27;t interfere by forcing their views onto others. We definitely won&#x27;t.&quot;

                              <span>Pre-orders are now live for the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, with a new trailer showing fresh footage of Lady Dimitrescu in action.


The Winters Expansion DLC builds on the Mercenaries mode and gives players the chance to play as both the iconic Lady D and villainous Karl Heisenberg, as well as Chris Redfield.


That means swinging a giant hammer, manipulating metal, and throwing chairs - check it out in the trailer below.

Some fans had suspected the game - which sees you playing as Bat sidekicks Robin, Red Hood, Nightwing and Batgirl following the apparent demise of the Dark Knight - would somehow fake Bat&#x27;s death so he could return later.

                              <span>Following today&#x27;s news that Ubisoft&#x27;s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandorahas been delayed and will no longer release along James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar sequel this December, the publisher has announced a number of other significant changes to its release roster, with Splinter Cell VR and Ghost Recon Frontline now officially cancelled alongside two previously unannounced games.


Ubisoft shared the news during its latest earnings call, only saying it had made the decision to cancel all four titles after taking into account the &quot;more uncertain economic environment&quot;.


Ghost Recon Frontline, which received a less-than-stellar reception when it was announced last October, was to be a new free-to-play instalment in Ubisoft&#x27;s long-running military shooter series. The core experience would have featured a large-scale, battle-royale-style 102-person mode where teams of three players completed objectives before calling for extraction, but other modes were also detailed.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re discussing NFTs - and the video game industry&#x27;s continued interest in trying to sell them to us.

The past 24 hours have seen two major NFT announcements from a pair of companies taking radically different stances. On the one hand, there&#x27;s Square Enix, which has decided to celebrate the venerable Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s 25th anniversary by launching a range of NFT mechandise. This announcement, its fair to say, has gone down like cold sick. 

On the other hand, there&#x27;s Mojang - the Microsoft-owned maker of Minecraft - which has drawn a line in the sand and said it will not integrate NFTs or allow others to use Minecraft in order to sell them. Is this end for video game NFTs? Unlikely! But as the planet burns, what does the future hold? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

                              <span>Bungie has said it&#x27;ll be giving fans to &quot;witness what&#x27;s next&quot; for Destiny 2 as part of a developer showcase scheduled to air on 23rd August.


While Bungie&#x27;s official announcement didn&#x27;t share specifics about the livestream, the developer has already been extremely forthcoming regarding the next few years for Destiny 2, so it&#x27;s almost certain August will see the developer showcasing its previously announced, but still mysterious, Lightfall expansion.


Revealed back in June 2020, Lightfall - which is currently expected to launch sometime in 2023 - will be Destiny 2&#x27;s penultimate expansion, coming between this year&#x27;s The Witch Queen and the game&#x27;s finale expansion The Final Shape. Bungie previously confirmed the latter will bring Destiny&#x27;s Light and Darkness Saga to a close.

                              <span>Steam Early Access smash hit Vampire Survivors has just received its newest patch, bringing the game one step closer to its full 1.0 release.


Patch 9.0,  nicknamed &quot;The Flashy One&quot; by developer Poncle, adds one character, a bonus challenge stage called Boss Rash, four achievements, two Arcanas, and a new hidden game mechanic as well as minor tweaks and bug fixes.
Boss Rash, as the name suggests, is a boss rush stage, and new Arcanas Gemini and Twilight Requiem allow players to further experiment with their playstyle.

                              <span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft&#x27;s movie tie-in from The Division developer Massive Entertainment, has been delayed. 


The game will now launch in &quot;2023-24&quot;, Ubisoft confirmed this afternoon, as part of its first quarter of 2022 financial results. 


This seemingly means a shift back to the publisher&#x27;s next financial year, meaning we won&#x27;t see Avatar now until after 31st March 2023.

                              <span>Rockstar has announced the next major expansion for Grand Theft Auto Online, and it hits a little too close to reality. 


The Criminal Enterprises expansion, which released on 26th July, sees the Southern San Andreas economy in crisis, with petrol prices at their highest levels in decades, supply chains in turmoil and a heatwave to top it all off. 
Sounds a little too familiar to be a satire if you ask me.

                              <span>At TwitchCon Amsterdam, streaming giant Twitch announced a number of new safety features coming soon to the platform.


This includes the ability for streamers to customise who can &quot;raid&quot; them, plus the ability to share a list of banned accounts with other streamers. Both of these features are in response to the mass wave of hate raids that affected marginalised streamers last year.



The features were introduced at the opening ceremony by Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: &quot;We&#x27;re never going to be done with safety on Twitch, it&#x27;s a goal without end.

The organisation of esports professionals and gaming influencers has begun trading on the Nasdaq to become one of only a few esports companies on the market.


However, when FaZe agreed last October to merge with acquisition company B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Corp., it was valued at close to $1bn. Now that value is closer to $716m.

                              <span>An official Detroit: Become Human manga series is launching on 22nd July in Japan.
Titled as Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories, the comic will follow the story of Japan&#x27;s own android revolution.


A short synopsis and some panels have been released on Famitsu in Japanese. The story is set in 2038 and stars Reina, an android idol. It seems that Tokyo Stories takes place alongside the original story of Detroit: Become Human, contrasting the largely hostile attitudes to androids seen in the game with a society that is much more accepting of them.

                              <span>Nintendo fans should immediately stop using its archaic Wi-Fi dongle, the company has said. 


The device - officially named the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector - slotted into your PC and provided internet access to the Nintendo DS.


However, continued use now risks your computer being targeted by &quot;unauthorised access&quot; or &quot;infection of the computer terminal&quot; with a virus, Nintendo has now cautioned.

Today, the internet is awash with all sorts of new information about the game, including details about its accessibility options and control layout. 
If you are keen to avoid any spoilers, there will be some included in the text below - so take this as your cue to read something else on Eurogamer if you so wish.

The appearance of Specialists was one of the early criticisms levelled by players, who felt their clean look and rather light-hearted demeanour did not fit with the game&#x27;s harsh post-climate change apocalyptic world. 


Based on rendered images posted by the developer, the Specialists have a more gritty look, with burly beards and a more serious resting face reflecting the mental scarring of warfare.

                              <span>Minecraft has drawn a red line around the use of NFTs inside and adjacent to Microsoft&#x27;s hugely-popular survival sandbox game, effectively banning their use.


Last night, Minecraft developer Mojang posted a blog laying out a clear policy on NFTs, which it said created &quot;models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with our guidelines and the spirit of Minecraft&quot;. 


&quot;To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications, nor may Minecraft in-game content such as worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods, be utilised by blockchain technology to create a scarce digital asset,&quot; Mojang confirmed.

&quot;EA Sports stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and like so many voices across the world of football, calls for peace and an end to the invasion of Ukraine,&quot; a statement issued to Eurogamer reads.

                              <span>Following January&#x27;s news that New Line Cinema is working on a sequel to last year&#x27;s commercially successful Mortal Kombat movie reboot, Deadline reports that project&#x27;s director, Simon McQuoid, will return to the helm for part two.


Last year&#x27;s movie followed the adventures of Cole Young, a former professional MMA fighter - and a new character to the series - who becomes ensnared in a plot by sorcerer Shang Tsung to eliminate the new generation of Earthrealm&#x27;s Mortal Kombat champions. Despite the return of plenty of familiar faces, and a strong opening fight (which you can see below), Eurogamer&#x27;s resident Mortal Kombat fan Wesley Yin-Poole wasn&#x27;t overly impressed by the end result.


Yet despite a generally lacklustre critical reception, the Mortal Kombat movie apparently did big numbers for New Line, opening at No. 1 at the US box office and ranking among the all-time top feature titles on HBO Max, where it simultaneously released. A sequel was almost inevitable then, and New Line confirmed its plans for a follow-up in January this year.

                              <span>Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley, who served as co-director on Uncharted 2, Uncharted 4, and the The Last of Us before leaving the games industry in 2017, has announced he&#x27;s returning to game development and is establishing a new studio, Wildflower Interactive, to do just that.


Straley broke the news of his return in a video shared on Twitter, explaining, &quot;In 2017, I left the industry not sure if I wanted to make games anymore, but the longer I was away, I kept thinking about this medium, and everything yet to be done and everything I wanted to do still - and this idea kept following me.&quot;


&quot;So I grabbed some friends,&quot; Straley continued, &quot;and we started prototyping and the idea started getting good, it started becoming exciting again, and I realised I need to make this game. But if I&#x27;m going to make this game, it means I have to build a team, and if I build a team, I have to build a company, and if we&#x27;re going to do that then we have to do it the right way.&quot;

                              <span>With just a few short weeks to go until Insomniac Games&#x27; superb Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump from PlayStation 5 to PC on 12th August, Sony has released new details on the game&#x27;s PC-exclusive features, plus full spec requirements so prospective purchasers can get a sense of how it&#x27;ll run on their machines.


Starting with the new features arriving as part of Spider-Man Remastered&#x27;s PC release, these&#x27;ll include (for those with compatible GPUs) ray-traced reflections at varying quality levels, plus support for Nvidia DLSS and DLAA. All players, meanwhile, can take advantage of Spider-Man&#x27;s customisable rendering systems, including SSAO, texture filtering, LoD quality, and shadows.

Additionally, there&#x27;s support for various monitor resolutions and ratios - including ultra wide, panoramic, and Nvidia Surround multi-monitor set-ups - all playable in either windowed, full-screen, or exclusive full-screen rendering modes.

                              <span>Lost Ark&#x27;s big July update has arrived, bringing with it, among other things, the new Arcanist advanced mage class, who gets things done by tossing magic cards about the place.


Alongside the Arcanist, July&#x27;s update (officially titled Spells in Spades) introduces a new ultra-tough Inferno difficulty version of the Valtan Legion raid - which requires item level 1445 to participate in - plus tougher Challenge Abyssal Dungeons. This twist on standard Abyssal Dungeons is a weekly activity that, like the updated Valtan Legion raid, will feature its own increased rewards for players able to overcome its challenges.


It&#x27;s undoubtedly the Arcanist that&#x27;s taking centre-stage though, and she joins the Bard and Sorceress as Lost Ark&#x27;s third available Mage Advanced Class. Using special cards imbued with Magick, she&#x27;s able to deploy them in multiple ways, summoning powerful attacks from within the cards or simply using them in massive numbers to slice up foes.

The rollcall of extras set to be bestowed on players next month, on Saturday 13th August, includes new Timed Research which will award players with a full avatar item set themed around G-Zig.


All-in-all, it&#x27;s a massive step up from this weekend&#x27;s Community Day for July, which featured boring bird Pokémon Starly.

FIFA 23 is of course EA&#x27;s final FIFA-titled football game. From next year&#x27;s game, EA will use the EA Sports FC title instead, ending a run of almost 30 years of EA-made FIFA games.


EA confirmed FIFA 23 includes World Cup Qatar 2022, which kicks off this November, and the Women&#x27;s World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023, which starts in July 2023.

That means FIFA 23 on PC benefits from all the new HyperMotion 2 (yes, FIFA features have sequels now) gameplay, new animations and graphics improvements.

                              <span>FIFA 23&#x27;s big new gameplay feature is a power shot.


The power shot, which is available across generations (so, for example, PS4 and PS5), is a new skill-based, risk versus reward shooting mechanic.


EA wanted to introduce more skill to shooting, the company said during a recent presentation attended by Eurogamer, so in FIFA 23, if you carve out enough space for yourself and aim precisely, you can score impressive-looking goals that have more power and accuracy, but with the risk of a longer animation.

                              <span>FIFA 23 on Nintendo Switch is once again a &quot;Legacy Edition&quot;, EA has confirmed.


In news that is perhaps unsurprising, FIFA 23 on Switch, due out 30th September, is basically the same as FIFA 22 on Switch.


As EA puts it in its own words: &quot;Gameplay features and modes will have parity with FIFA 22 on Nintendo Switch and will feature the same gameplay from FIFA 22 Legacy Edition without any new development or significant enhancements.&quot;

Blizzard&#x27;s Diablo Hell&#x27;s Ink takeover event began in Los Angeles on Saturday and will continue until 10th September. During this time, fans can get a free Diablo tattoo, whilst also nabbing their beta access and digital copy of the game in the process. 


The campaign will hit eight cities in total, across North America, Europe and Australia, with each pop-up opening for one day only. A competition ran in June which gave fans the chance to win a custom Diablo tattoo, but anyone who missed out on one of those can still get involved.

Freighters were, of course, one of No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s very first post-launch additions, arriving all the way back in November 2016 as part of its game-changing Foundation Update.


While the Foundation Update&#x27;s other major addition, base building, has undergone several revisions in the year&#x27;s since its debut, freighters - those giant, habitable, expandable space vessels Travellers are now given early on in their adventures - have not, and their limited building blocks have remained an ongoing frustration for players like me who&#x27;ve long dreamed of constructing something a bit more lavish for their home among the stars.

In Netflix&#x27;s latest financial results, the streaming giant revealed that despite airing new seasons of front-runner Stranger Things and other popular series such as The Umbrella Academy.  


In the UK, the cost of living crisis is one of the biggest issues currently faced by households, and streaming services are feeling the impact of it. The BBC  reported that many people are choosing to cancel their subscriptions in order to compensate for increasing bills and prices. Netflix is likely one of the companies affected by this, with 300,000 of the total 970,000 subscribers lost residing in the EMEA region.

Summer designs for Thor, Black Widow and Tony Stark have been unearthed in a new datamine of the game, from reliable leaker Miller (thanks, MP1st).


Square Enix is yet to announce the skins officially - and of course, being in the game&#x27;s files doesn&#x27;t guarantee they will be released.

                              <span>Naughty Dog officially announced its plans to bring The Last of Us Part 1 to PlayStation 5 (and eventually PC) with a shiny new remake that will be a &quot;total overhaul of the original experience&quot; at Summer Game Fest last month.
The remake itself is not due out until September, however, we are already seeing gameplay leaks making their way out into the wild. Déjà vu anyone?
The most recent leaks, which have now been mostly removed from the internet by a very fast-moving Naughty Dog, showed off a scene from very early in the game&#x27;s narrative.

                              <span>Valve has detailed how the current heatwave will affect its Steam Deck hardware, which will shut down completely in high temperatures. 


Even before this happens, performance will be &quot;throttled&quot; when the hardware is hot, Valve has said. Honestly, after the past couple of days, I can relate. 


&quot;For our friends in the midst of a heatwave, a quick note about Steam Deck in high temperatures,&quot; Valve wrote via Twitter last night. &quot;Steam Deck performs at its best in ambient temperatures between zero and 35°C. If the temperature gets higher than this, Steam Deck may start to throttle performance to protect itself.&quot;

The group, named GWA Albany, has said it is pushing for fairer pay, improved healthcare benefits and more transparency in addressing workplace issues. 


Addressing crunch is another key demand, with staff asking for the establishment of &quot;reasonable protocols&quot; to address times when they are asked to work extended hours.

In fact, it has become the biggest PC launch ever for publisher Annapurna Interactive (which I feel should rename itself Anna-purr-na for the occassion).
At the time of writing, there are 34,139 players on Steam making their four-legged way around Stray&#x27;s environments, with an overall peak of 62,963.
Figures posted by Steam tracker Benji-Sales show a launch far higher than other recent Annapurna titles.

The hackers pretended to be a “community of free people around the world who are fighting russia’s aggression”—much like the IT Army. But the app they developed was actually malware. The hackers called it CyberAzov, in reference to the Azov Regiment or Battalion, a far-right group that has become part of Ukraine’s national guard.

                              <span>Xbox veteran and Halo Infinite head of design Jerry Hook has unveiled his new &quot;AAA&quot; studio Jar of Sparks, a first-party developer for Chinese publisher NetEase that will focus on creating the &quot;next generation of narrative-driven action games&quot;.


Hook, who announced his departure from 343 Industries and Microsoft back in May, has a long and notable career in the games industry, having joined the Xbox Live team in 2003. He would later take on an executive producer role at Microsoft after a brief sojourn at Bungie, gaining credits on numerous 343-Industries-developed titles including Halo 4 and Halo 5: Guardians.


Hook&#x27;s new studio, Jar of Sparks, is based in Seattle and, according to NetEase&#x27;s press release announcing the formation of the company, already boasts a &quot;team of industry veterans who have worked on some of the biggest franchises in video game history&quot;.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long and eventful road for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, but despite its troubled development, which has included the removal of its original developer Hardsuit Labs, Paradox Interactive has popped up to assure fans that work continues on the project, although it won&#x27;t be shown at the publisher&#x27;s upcoming PDXCon.


Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, a sequel to developer Troika Games&#x27; much-loved 2004 cult-classic RPG, was initially announced for PC and consoles back in 2019, when it was expected to release the following year. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t take long for the project to run into trouble and, later in 2019, Hardsuit Labs announced the first of several delays.


By the end of 2020, lead narrative designer Brian Mitsoda and creative director Ka&#x27;ai Cluney had been fired from their roles, senior narrative designer Cara Ellison had quit the project, and Paradox had revised Bloodlines 2&#x27;s release date once more, pushing it into 2021. Then, things went from bad to worse; as 2021 got underway Paradox announced it had removed Hardsuit from the project, delayed the game indefinitely, and cancelled new pre-orders.

                              <span>Three weeks after the US Supreme Court overturned key legislation granting individuals the constitutional right to choose an abortion, Take-Two Interactive - which publishes the likes of Grand Theft Auto, Borderlands, BioShock, Mafia, and XCOM through its various subsidiaries - has issued a statement saying it &quot;acknowledges&quot; the decision &quot;is a significant event&quot;.


Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s overturning of Roe v Wade at the end of June, publishers and developers around the world - including Microsoft, Ubisoft, EA, Bungie, Naughty Dog, Double Fine, and Bethesda - released statements in support of reproductive rights. Take-Two was one of the few major publishers, alongside Activision Blizzard, not to respond publicly to the news.


Three weeks on, though, Take-Two has now released its own statement across a limited number of social media channels, including its own LinkedIn page and subsidiary Zynga&#x27;s Twitter feed.

Twitch Charity will allow streamers to select a charity, set a fundraising goal and collect donations from subs and Bits all from within the creator dashboard. Twitch does not take a cut of donations or receive any tax incentives.


The US-only closed beta is available now for selected streamers and for a limited number of charities, with the aim to roll it out globally across the platform soon.

                              <span>Legendary game maker John Romero - best known for his work on developer id Software&#x27;s seminal run of 90s shooters including Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake - has announced he&#x27;s working on a new FPS in collaboration with an as-yet unnamed &quot;major publisher&quot;.


Romero shared the news in a statement posted to Twitter, revealing the project is being handled by Romero Games - which most recently worked on mafia strategy title Empire of Sin for publisher Paradox Interactive - and that it would be built around an &quot;original, new&quot; IP.


Beyond that, details are thin - the official FAQ says &quot;it&#x27;s way too early to share any other information&quot; - with the remainder of the announcement only noting Romero Games is currently hiring across a range of positions for its new FPS, and that it&#x27;s particularly keen to hear from those with experience using Unreal Engine 5.

                              <span>No More Heroes 3 will (Travis) touchdown on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S (both supported with Smart Delivery), PlayStation 5, PS4 and PC via Steam and the Microsoft Windows Store on 11th October.
The launch of the game on these devices will bring with it improved HD visuals and framerates, with faster loading times to &quot;keep players dishing out eye-popping ultraviolence&quot; throughout (how lovely).
To accompany this announcement, we also got a nice shiny new trailer to pour over. This is full of beam katanas, a general sense of mass destruction and Travis&#x27; cat Jeane - what&#x27;s not to love?! You can check it out for yourself below.

                              <span>Set photos from Amazon&#x27;s upcoming TV adaption of Fallout have begun to circulate online. 
Yesterday, Collider published photos taken by a reader from Staten Island in New York. 


The photos show the exterior set of a Super Duper Mart with some sleek, round-bodied cars ripped straight from the 1950s parked outside, rusted all over. The building itself isn&#x27;t doing much better, sporting the grime and abandoned wear you would expect to see roaming around Fallout 4&#x27;s post-apocalyptic Boston.

This free update, which will be available on 21st July, will also bring a new stadium called Desert Ruin and additional Knight gear to tackle the game&#x27;s frantic football frays (say that three times quickly after a few drinks!).

Shared by Famitsu, mixed martial artist Mikuru Asakura recently uploaded a video in which he visited Sega&#x27;s development headquarters. 
His tour of the studio is interesting enough, but what has caught most people&#x27;s attention is that within this video we also get our first look at Ichiban Kasuga (Like a Dragon&#x27;s protagonist), Koichi Adachi and Yu Nanba in Yakuza 8. You can check it out for yourself below.

In anticipation of this release, its developers have been sharing little snippets of what we can expect, with the most recent one giving us a closer look at Melee Island&#x27;s dock, an eerie-looking ship and the outside of the Scumm Bar. 
&quot;New surveillance video for #MonkeyIslandMonday!,&quot; tweeted developer Dave Grossman. &quot;Strange man seen striding purposefully on Melee dock, ignoring the pelicans and bar as though he had somewhere to be, some devilish puzzle to solve...&quot;
That strange man is, of course, none other than series hero Guybrush Threepwood. Can you believe he passed up the opportunity to quench his thirst with a healthy pint of grog? Something must be afoot.

                              <span>BAFTA Award winner Inscryption now has a release date on PlayStation. Publisher Devolver Digital has announced that the deck-builder roguelike game will be out on 30th August on PS4 and PS5.
As we&#x27;ve previously reported, the game will have PlayStation-exclusive features, such as haptic feedback, to ensure you feel the weight of every card you play.
This marks Inscryption&#x27;s first release on consoles, so if you haven&#x27;t given it a try yet, we would highly recommend it. The game earned an Essential rating from Bertie in Eurogamer&#x27;s Inscryption review when the game first released last year on PC.

                              <span>A hacker has posted internal documents from Roblox in an extortion attempt.


The documents, seen by Motherboard, appear to include personal information on Roblox-focused creators producing some of the platform&#x27;s most popular games.



The hacker released 4GB of documents on a forum, stolen from a Roblox employee.

                              <span>Alicia Vikander has revealed the sequel to 2018&#x27;s Tomb Raider film adaptation is currently in some sort of limbo due to the &quot;politics&quot; involved with Amazon&#x27;s purchase of MGM. 
Vikander, who took on the axe wielding, bow and arrow shooting role of Lara Croft in the most recent Tomb Raider film, spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the sequel, saying that she has &quot;no clue&quot; how things will go from here. &quot;With the MGM and Amazon buyout... its kind of politics,&quot; she explained. 
That being said, Vikander is just waiting for the sequel to be given the green light once more. &quot;I think Misha [Green, who is currently attached to the project as its writer and director] and I have been ready, so it&#x27;s kind of in somebody else&#x27;s hands, to be honest,&quot; she shared.

                              <span>Bungie has filed a lawsuit against a Destiny 2 player, accusing them of cheating and harassing the game&#x27;s developers.



The player, Luca Leone, regularly streamed the game using cheats on his Twitch channel miffysworld, for which Bungie repeatedly banned him. Leone created 13 separate accounts in an attempt to evade bans, with each account violating the game&#x27;s Limited Software License Agreement.


Leone sent threatening messages from his Twitter account, about his desire to &quot;burn down&quot; Bungie&#x27;s offices and declaring certain Bungie employees were &quot;not safe&quot; as he intended to move to their neighbourhood - including community manager Dylan Gafner.

This closure extends to in-game purchases made outside of the eShop app on these platforms, such as within the 3DS&#x27; Nintendo Badge Arcade.


Nintendo confirmed the date today, and reminded 3DS and Wii U owners that the 29th August 2022 deadline for adding eShop card funds was now approaching.

                              <span>There had been rumblings amongst the gaming community that Motion Twin&#x27;s roguelike Dead Cells was coming to the end of its lifespan. Thankfully, this is not the case. Rather, the developer has released a new roadmap for the game that covers the rest of this year, and into 2023.
So, what can you expect to see heading your way? Well, for summer 2022, Dead Cells players should see the arrival of &quot;the long awaited panchaku&quot; as well as a new &quot;flame head outfit based on our beloved animated trailers&quot;. There will also be some rebalancing for various weapons and other items, but most endearingly you will soon be able to &quot;pet the pets&quot;.
Following this, autumn will see a new Boss Rush area enter the game. As with boss rush modes from other games (looking at you Metroid Dread), this area will let you test your metal against a series of Dead Cell&#x27;s bosses one after the other. As you progress, you will unlock new items to help you on your way.

                              <span>Following from its release on PlayStation, Xbox and PC last year, publisher Microids has announced that Oddworld: Soulstorm is coming to Switch. Specially &#x27;oddtimised&#x27; to run on the Switch&#x27;s hardware, the game follows series protagonist Abe after the events of Oddworld: New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty. 
Although the release date hasn&#x27;t been announced yet, preorders are now open for the physical Limited and Collector&#x27;s Odditions, the latter of which includes an exclusive nine-inch figurine of Abe and a 160-page artbook. Any pre-orders from participating retailers of the Limited or Collector&#x27;s Odditions will also include the game&#x27;s OST and a digital artbook. Sounds like some tasty goodies for any Oddworld fans.
In our Oddworld: Soulstorm review, Christian Donlan felt the game&#x27;s magical moments and brutal setting were well worth the few rough edges. With the UK currently feeling the effects of climate change, perhaps this is a good time to revisit a game where you can live out your fantasy of destroying a means of capitalist production.

                              <span>If you found yourself impressed by Lego&#x27;s recently unveiled Mighty Bowser set but couldn&#x27;t quite shake the feeling something was missing - say, around 13ft - then Nintendo has you covered. As part of San Diego Comic-Con, the company has constructed an absolute behemoth Mighty Bowser, measuring over 14ft tall.


The retail version of Mighty Bowser is, of course, already pretty sizeable, weighing in at 2,807 pieces, making it the largest Lego Mario adult set yet. However, the San Diego version absolutely crushes that like a sudden Thwomp to the bonce, utilising over 663,900 bricks to create its magnificent heft.


And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the 14-ft tall version is even articulated, able to move its thumbs, shift its arms, swivel its head and eyes indepently, and waggle its eyebrows for good measure. You can see the (slightly intimidating) thing in action below.

                              <span>Just as Netflix&#x27;s live-action Resident Evil series finds itself flung unceremoniously onto the &#x27;disappointment&#x27; pile, news arrives of another video game being adapted for television - this time in the form of Obsidian&#x27;s inch-high garden adventure Grounded.


Released into early access back in July 2020, Grounded adapts the familiar gathering-and-crafting survival formula into a rollicking family friendly adventure inspired by the likes of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and A Bug&#x27;s Life. Here, players are miniaturised and sent on a conspiracy laden escapade around their now-towering backyard, forced to fend off giant insects and other creatures as they explore, scavenge, and plot their escape.


According to Deadline, Grounded&#x27;s new television adaptation will follow the same basic premise, telling the story of four friends who, the summer before high school, find their plans to elevate their social standing upended after discovering shrinking technology that makes them two inches tall. &quot;Now the four shrunken friends must learn to survive in a towering backyard that&#x27;s a jungle full of enormous predators,&quot; explains Deadline, &quot;and hiding a vast corporate conspiracy threatening their entire town.&quot;

                              <span>Fall Guys players have a phallic treat awaiting them in their inventories right now, with developer Mediatonic handing out troublingly elongated Tall Guys to one and all following its recent, widely publicised cock-up.


Fall Guys&#x27; Tall Guys disemination doesn&#x27;t, admittedly, appear to be directly related to the recent snafu - which saw players recieving snotty customer service responses after a bug in the game caused them to auto-buy cosmetics - but developer Mediatonic presumably won&#x27;t say no to the positive publicity right now.


One look at the image accompanying Mediatonic&#x27;s promise of a &quot;BIG surprise&quot; for all Fall Guys players on Twitter today makes it abundantly clear where the developer&#x27;s mind was at the time, but the good (?) news is the actual in-game Tall Guys are marginally less phallic than they appear in their promo material - as you can see below.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bit of bad news for anyone looking forward to the arrival of free-to-play arena shooter Star Wars: Hunters; developer Zynga has announced it&#x27;s delaying the game&#x27;s full release into 2023 in order to ensure it &quot;meets the high expectations we are setting&quot;.


This isn&#x27;t the first delay for Star Wars: Hunters, of course; announced back in February 2021 for Switch, iOS, and Android, the game was originally expected to launch later that year, but eventually saw its full release pushed into 2022. Zynga has, however, managed to soft launch the game in select territories in the interim, so there are at least some players who&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try it in that time.


Announcing a second delay for the game&#x27;s full release on Twitter, Zynga explained, &quot;We are working tirelessly to achieve our vision for Star Wars: Hunters. Our ambition is to create a competitive battle arena game that will entertain for years to come. To ensure we meet the high epgetation we are setting for fans globally and ourselves as developers we have made the decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters [to 2023].&quot;

                              <span>When Resident Evil Village released last year, there was one character that quite clearly (and also quite literally) stood head and shoulders above the rest - the towering and bewitching Lady Dimitrescu. She was on everything from beach towels to buses.
But while she may not have popped up in the series prior to Village, we could yet see her again elsewhere. Andrew Dabb, showrunner for Netflix&#x27;s divisive new Resident Evil series, is also a fan of Lady D, and has said he&#x27;d like to bring her to the TV adaptation in future seasons. 
Speaking to Polygon, Dabb revealed: &quot;Over the course of the series, I want to bring everything in... Left to my own devices, I want Lady D, I want the plant monster, I want it all.&quot;

                              <span>The FIFA 23 Ultimate Edition has Chelsea&#x27;s Sam Kerr and PSG&#x27;s Kylian Mbappé on the cover, EA has revealed.


The inclusion of Kerr, who plays for Chelsea and Australia&#x27;s women&#x27;s teams and is widely considered one of the best female footballers in the world, marks the first time a female FIFA cover athlete is included on an internationally-released version of EA Sports&#x27; long-running football game.


Kerr appearing on the FIFA 23 cover wearing a Chelsea kit suggests the inclusion of Chelsea FC Women and, following that, the Women&#x27;s Super League - the highest league of women&#x27;s football in England - in FIFA for the first time.

This includes upcoming maps and weapons, as well as details of Infinite&#x27;s Forge mode (thanks, LeaksInfinite/HaloDotAPI). Also, a mysterious object called the quantum translocator.


First up, here&#x27;s the fan-favourite and powerful DMR weapon, missing from Infinite until now.

                              <span>Nintendo has delayed the release of its Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Collector&#x27;s Edition for the UK and the EU until September. So, after the game&#x27;s launch which, in case you missed it, is 29th July.
The company cited &quot;unforeseen logistical challenges&quot; as the reason for this delay, before going on to apologise for any inconvenience this decision may have caused.
However, all is far from lost. If you had your heart set on this Collector&#x27;s Edition of the game, you will obvisouly still have the chance to purchase Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on its release. After that, you will be able to get your hands on this edition&#x27;s contents separately without the game itself.

Tomorrow&#x27;s new release As Dusk Falls, a stylish narrative adventure Eurogamer just recommended in its review, is also part of the list.


As Dusk Falls is the first game from new studio Interior/Night, which formed as a breakaway from the controversial Heavy Rain developer Quantic Dream. For more on all that, Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale recently visited the studio to sit down with its founder Caroline Marchal.

                              <span>We are not in short supply when it comes to video game to TV adaptations. As well as those already released, there are also numerous titles in the pipeline, from Fallout and The Last of Us to Horizon and God of War. There have even been talks of Life is Strange making its way to the live-action small screen. 
But one video game franchise that has already seen numerous adaptations is Resident Evil. We have been gifted with big budget live action films and CG miniseries over the years. 
Now there&#x27;s yet another take on the zombie-filled world of Racoon City, thanks to Netflix. This show follows Jade Wesker (daughter of series regular Albert Wesker) as she fights to survive in a world overrun by blood-thirsty infected creatrures. So, some pretty standard Resident Evil stuff. The being said though, this newest release doesn&#x27;t seem to be striking a chord with its viewers. In fact, it is one of Netflix&#x27;s lowest-rated shows ever.

It&#x27;s worth noting these trials are not available separately - you are essentially selecting to sign up to Extra/Premium via their various monthly/three-monthly/annual billing options, and just get seven days free up front.

In recent years, the company has favoured Battle.net for its PC games. However, this new page on Steam suggests that Activision is readying itself for the completion of the biggest deal in gaming history.
Fans of Activision&#x27;s various franchises have taken to forums such as Reddit and ResetEra to share their feelings about this move by Activision. In short, everyone is hopeful about what this might mean for the developer&#x27;s various games on PC (ahem, Tony Hawk).

Skip to the 9:50 mark in the video below and you&#x27;ll hear the studio team discussing victory conditions, and see an exhaustive list of factions noted under the heading &quot;Domination Campaign Victory&quot;.


Intriguingly, this list includes four factions new to the Total War: Warhammer series and unannounced so far. These, fans reckon, are likely candidates for DLC in future.

                              <span>A new report states that Russia is looking into making its own game engine. This comes as support from other companies has been pulled following Putin&#x27;s barbaric invasion of Ukraine. 
The report by Kommersant (via PC Gamer) states that &quot;a number of major players in the Russian IT market including VK&quot; [Russia&#x27;s own Facebook alternative] are currently in talks with the Ministry of Digital Development to create a &quot;domestic game engine (a means of developing video games) and the possibility of allocating state funding for it.&quot;
Talks regarding this new engine began in May, when Russian developers allegedly voiced their concerns that they will soon have limited access to other engines such as Unreal or Unity. During these talks, the initiative was described as &quot;important and urgent&quot; for Russia&#x27;s video game developers.

                              <span>The developer of PowerWash Simulator has told players not to look at the sun, in order to avoid a game-crashing bug.

Reducing the amount of time you look at the sun &quot;isn&#x27;t a great workaround&quot;, the developer admitted via a post to Twitter. But until a hotfix (sorry) is rolled out, it&#x27;s all there is. And, y&#x27;know, not looking directly at the sun is just solid advice in general.

Mozilla introduced support for URL stripping in Firefox 102, which it launched in June 2022. Firefox removes tracking parameters from web addresses automatically, but only in private browsing mode or when the browser’s Tracking Protection feature is set to strict.

                              <span>Unity boss John Riccitiello has apologised for calling developers that don&#x27;t prioritise monetisation in the creative process &quot;fucking idiots&quot;.

Earlier this week, Riccitiello was slammed for stating that mobile developers who don&#x27;t seek to squeeze monetisation from their smartphone games represented only &quot;a very small portion of the gaming industry&quot;, calling them &quot;the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people&quot; that were also &quot;some of the biggest fucking idiots&quot;.

After insisting the interview was &quot;clickbait&quot; and &quot;out of context&quot;, Riccitiello has now apologised for his &quot;crude word choice&quot; and said if he had been &quot;smart in choosing [his] words&quot; he would have said that he is &quot;working to provide developers with tools so they can better understand what their players think, and it is up to them to act or not, based on this feedback&quot;.

In a blog post that outlines the latest update, Amazon Games says the team &quot;took a stylish approach to immersive characters and settings&quot; and whether you prefer &quot;pirates or musical themes, every aspect of this celebration radiates summer fun&quot;.

Right now you can only participate in the aforementioned summer fun via the Public Test Realm (PTR), but the event should be rolling out to all players later in July.

                              <span>The UK government has told the UK games industry that if it won&#x27;t take action on loot boxes, it will draw up legislation that will.

As noted by our colleagues at our sister site GamesIndustry.biz, the government today told game publishers that the luxury of regulating itself will cease if it does not take control of the sale of loot boxes to children and young people as those that use loot boxes are &quot;more likely to experience gambling, mental health, financial, and problem gaming-related harms&quot;.

Back in June 2020, the UK Government announced it would launch a call for evidence on loot boxes in response to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) inquiry into immersive and addictive technologies, and began inviting responses from the public in September.

                              <span>Scalpers are already trying to flog limited edition versions of God of War Ragnarök for more than twice the retail price.

Pre-orders are now open for the four different editions of God of War Ragnarök - the most expensive of which, the Jotnar Edition, is priced at £230. As Tom explained at the time, this includes lots of fancy physical items and a digital code for the game - but no disc.

Given the limited numbers, it probably comes as no surprise that already the more collectible editions have already sold out on official retail sites like GAME and the official PlayStation Store. And, perhaps even more predictably enough, it looks like too many scalpers have laid their dirty hands on the pre-orders (or pretending to, anyway) and are listing them on auction places for massively inflated prices online.

Whilst previously, the menu offered the choice of either a &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; body type, Blizzard has now removed gendered language and now simply offers the choice between &quot;Body 1&quot; and &quot;Body 2&quot;. 

&quot;The new body type labels are merely text changes within the character creation screen and barber shop,&quot; explains Wowhead (thanks, NME). &quot;Where it previously gave players the option to select Male or Female body types, it now simply refers to them as Body 1 and Body 2 respectively.&quot;

Unlike some no-hit runners that typically zip through the game quickly by avoiding bosses and entire areas, Streamer Ainrun - who&#x27;s admittedly something of an expert at completing From Software games without getting hit - completed his no-hit run and took on the Grafted Scion, the first boss battle that typically requires you to jump off a cliff and die to proceed.

&quot;I’ve been doing no-hit runs and speed runs of From Software games ever since 2020, starting with Dark Souls 1,” Ainrun told Kotaku.

                              <span>As part of this year’s TennoCon celebrations, Warframe developer Digital Extremes has given fans a nice big look at the free-to-play sci-fi shooter&#x27;s ambitious Duviri Paradox expansion, which is currently due to launch some time in &quot;winter 2022&quot;.


The Duviri Paradox will be Warframe&#x27;s latest open-world expansion, following the likes of Plains of Eidolon and Heart of Deimos, and plunges players into the extremely weird world of Duviri, featuring a sort of fantasy western aesthetic shot through with floating islands and fractals.


It&#x27;s also a world that appears to exist inside of the head of new big bad Dominus Thrax, who additionally serves as its less-than-benevolent ruler. Everyone living within Thrax&#x27;s domain is trapped inside an endless time loop, doomed to be executed over and over and over again.

                              <span>Digital Extremes - the studio behind free-to-play sci-fi shooter Warframe, has announced Soulframe, a new fantasy themed action-MMORPG set in a sister universe to Warframe.


Soulframe will be Digital Extremes&#x27; first new game in over five years, following on from 2017&#x27;s short-lived team-based FPS The Amazing Eternals, but details remain slight at this juncture.


Like its predecessor, Soulframe will adopt a free-to-play model when it eventually arrives at some unspecified future point, and Digital Extremes has shared a few additional details in an interview with The Washington Post. Here, it explains Soulframe will be built around &quot;slow and heavy&quot; melee combat, have a focus on exploration, and will feature a hub world similar to Warframe&#x27;s open-world planets. That world is said to be &quot;a little angry about what&#x27;s been done to it&quot;, causing the ground to shift throughout the day - leading to some proceduralism within the (presumably explorable) cave networks and crevasses beneath its surface.

Although the team said it would &quot;love&quot; to confirm the release date, it needed &quot;a bit more time&quot; but served up a single new screenshot - you can see it in the embedded tweet below; there&#x27;s a cult, body parts, and some strange symbols daubed around the place - to whet our collective appetites. 

It also teased that the new expansion will probably include Act 5 with some clever word play on Twitter.

                              <span>CD Projekt - the publisher behind studio CD Projekt Red, developer of The Witcher games and, of course, Cyberpunk 2077 - has seen its share value plummet by over 75 per cent.

That&#x27;s according to Business Insider Poland, which says that the disastrous launch of Cyberpunk 2077 has wiped the value of the then most-valuable games company in Europe from over 40 billion Polish złoty - that&#x27;s around £7.11bn - to less than zł10 billion - about £1.77bn.

The drop in CD Projekt&#x27;s value - whilst still remaining one of Poland&#x27;s most valuable companies - reportedly takes it back to a value last seen around 2017.

As part of the two-year anniversary celebrations, developer Sucker Punch revealed a number of stats about how we&#x27;ve played the game, including news that 9.73 million copies have been sold since it released in the summer of 2020.

Other intriguing stats include the news that since launch, players have taken 78 million photos, played 91.4 million Legends mode missions, hosted 540.8 million duels, and seen a staggering 998.5 million standoffs.

                              <span>Blizzard has made further changes to its Overwatch 2 hero roster in another beta mid-cycle patch.

Six more heroes have had their abilities tweaked in a bid to rebalance the game ahead of its formal release, including Doomfist, Junker Queen, Orisa, Sojourn, Symmetra, and Zenyatta.

Doomfist&#x27;s changes include minimum damage required to empower Rocket Punch reduced from 100 to 90 damage, and the movement speed penalty while blocking reduced from 50 to 35 per cent. They will also now deal damage to all enemies knocked back &quot;instead of only the first target impacted&quot;.

                              <span>Mediatonic has apologised for a bug that was causing players to make &quot;accidental&quot; premium purchases in Fall Guys.

The issue first popped up on the game&#x27;s subreddit, with dozens of players complaining that items had been &quot;auto-purchased&quot; when previewing them in Fall Guys&#x27; in-game store.

Other issues included Show Bucks going mysteriously missing, hidden key bindings triggering purchases, items being switched after selection, and &quot;a lot of players&quot; finding that they inexplicably have &quot;less currency now&quot;.

                              <span>Elden Ring is the best-selling game of 2022. 

Research firm NPD Group - which originally asserted Elden Ring was one of the top 10 best-selling games in history before retracting the claim due to &quot;incomplete data&quot; - reports in an updated statement that From Software&#x27;s action RPG has &quot;placed first in dollar sales in four of its first five months in market&quot;, is the best-selling game of June 2022, and remains &quot;the best-selling game of 2022 year to date&quot;.

&quot;Elden Ring repeated as the best-selling game of the month, and it remains the best-selling game of 2022 year to date,&quot; NPD said in the revised statement. &quot;Elden Ring has placed first in dollar sales in four of its first five months in market.&quot;

                              <span>Sony has confirmed its acquisition of Bungie is now complete.

Sony announced it would buy Bungie for $3.6bn back in February. At the time, Sony boss Jim Ryan stated the purchase was &quot;an important step in [Sony&#x27;s] strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience&quot;.

Despite a probe by the FTC that sought to review &quot;the latest example of how aggressive the agency is becoming in reviewing mergers&quot;, the agreement has now formally &quot;closed&quot; and Sony has posted across its social media channels to &quot;officially&quot; welcome Bungie to &quot;the PlayStation family&quot;.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; long-long-long-awaited Captaincy Update, first discussed prior to the game&#x27;s release all the way back in 2018, will miss its planned launch later this month and is now due to arrive alongside Season Seven on 4th August.
In its originally envisaged 2018 guise, the Captaincy Update was an early victim of Sea of Thieves&#x27; rocky launch, with Rare ultimately making the decision to place it &quot;on the back burner&quot; while it refocused its development plans. Most assumed it was lost to time after that, but, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, it suddenly resurfaced during Microsoft&#x27;s not-E3 showcase this June.
This new iteration of Captaincy follows the same basic premise of the originally teased update, introducing a host of new features designed around the idea of becoming the captain of your own distinctive vessel. These will include the ability to name your ship, decorate its cabin, earn unique rewards, make use of special new cash-in points across the ocean, and more.

                              <span>Up until now, The Sims 4 has presented itself as an enthusisatically flexi-sexual world, where every Sim is open to at least considering all attempts to woo and WooHoo. That&#x27;ll soon change, however, with an imminent update giving The Sims 4 players the opportunity to define their Sims&#x27; sexual orientations in a way that better reflects the real world.


Arriving as part of a free update accompanying The Sims 4&#x27;s next major expansion, High School Years, which launches on 28th July, the feature will add a new Sexual Orientation tab to the game&#x27;s Create-A-Sim screen. Here, player will have the opportunity to tinker with three settings that will impact how Sims interact with others in-game.


The first option enables players to choose whether a Sim is romantically attracted to men, women, both, or neither, meaning they&#x27;ll turn down romantic advances made by Sims that don&#x27;t fit that profile. Incidentally, while discussing the feature during its latest livestream, developer Maxis explained it&#x27;s currently using gender binary terms (despite making strides to add more inclusive pronoun options) for technical reasons relating to how The Sims 4, which is built on eight-year-old architecture, currently handles gender behind the scenes. It notes, however, that it hopes to expand the feature to encompass more gender identities over time.

                              <span>A new report has detailed a long-lost title from Totally Games, the developer best remembered for its work on the X-Wing series. Known as Knights of Decayden, it was planned as an early exclusive for the original Xbox before its cancellation and subsequent fade into obscurity.


Totally Games was, of course, a big deal back in the 1990s, having made a name for itself with LucasArts&#x27; hugely popular series of Star Wars space shooters, which included the likes of X-Wing, Tie Fighter, and X-Wing Alliance. Sadly, the studio closed in 2015, following a string of critically and commercially disappointing releases - but fans will likely get a kick out of a new Axios report detailing a fantasy flight combat game the developer was working on in partnership with Microsoft at the height of its success.


Knights of Decayden (other titles reportedly included alternative spelling Knights of Decadyn and Project Archipelago) was initially pitched to Sony under the name Knights of Utu for release on PS2, but eventually found its way under Microsoft&#x27;s wing, with the plan being to release it as an Xbox exclusive in the year following the fledgling console&#x27;s 2001 launch.

Karpyshyn served as lead writer for Mass Effect 1 and 2, though left BioWare part-way through the second game&#x27;s development. 


Discussing the trilogy in a new reddit AMA, Karpyshyn said that when he was in the Mass Effect 2 writers room, BioWare had &quot;some very ideas planned out&quot;.

Riccitiello raised eyebrows when discussing developers who don&#x27;t prioritise monetisation as part of their creative process.


&quot;It&#x27;s a very small portion of the gaming industry that works that way,&quot; Riccitiello told PocketGamer.biz, &quot;and some of these people are my favorite people in the world to fight with - they&#x27;re the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people. They&#x27;re also some of the biggest fucking idiots.&quot;

As detailed last week, Ragnarök will be available in four separate editions upon launch in November. 


Slightly less expensive, and also without a disc, the God of War Ragnarök Collector&#x27;s Edition costs £180. The Digital Deluxe edition costs £80 - as you might expect from the name, there&#x27;s no disc there either. Finally, a standard digital/disc copy of the game costs £70 on PS5, or £60 on PS4 (where there&#x27;s a £10 upgrade option).

                              <span>Developer Survios is teaming up with 20th Century Fox to create a new single-player, action-horror game based on the Alien franchise.


Details on the new venture - currently being referred to as &quot;Aliens&quot; - are pretty scarce right now, with Survios only saying it&#x27;ll feature an original storyline set somewhere between the events of Alien and Aliens, with players taking on the role of a &quot;battle hardened veteran [with] a vendetta against the Xenomorphs&quot;.


Given Survios&#x27; background as a primarily VR-focused developer - it&#x27;s worked on the likes of Creed: Rise to Glory, The Walking Dead Onslaught, and Puzzle Bobble 3D: Vacation Odyssey - it won&#x27;t be much of a surprise to hear its new Aliens project is also be getting the VR treatment.

                              <span>Fans eagerly awaited fresh news of EA&#x27;s highly-anticipated new Skate game have been given their wish, but it mighn&#x27;t be quite what they were expecting. EA and developer Full Circle have shared a new 18-minute video, announcing, among other things, that their long-awaited skateboarding revival will be a free-to-play live-service game.


Despite having variously been known as both Skate 4 and a Skate reboot since its development was announced in 2020, Full Circle now says the game &quot;isn&#x27;t a sequel, it&#x27;s not a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel.&quot; Instead, it&#x27;s described as an &quot;authentic evolution&quot; of the series - one whose last mainline entry arrived 12 years ago - that reflects &quot;where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world&quot;.


Full Circle also dropped an official name in the form of &quot;Skate.&quot; (that fullstop is here to stay it seems), and a new setting in San Vansterdam - described as a sister city to previous games&#x27; San Vanelona.

                              <span>Following its reveal last week, Ubisoft has now shown off three minutes of gameplay footage from its upcoming free-to-play mobile shooter The Division Resurgence in a new trailer.


Resurgence (not to be confused with Heartland, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play Division game for PC and consoles), will, like other entries in the series, be an open-world third-person shooter RPG set in post-crisis America - in this case, Manhattan - following a deadly virus outbreak.


It does promises a fresh story campaign, in which players once again take on the role of an agent allied to the Strategic Homeland, delivering a &quot;new perspective on key story events&quot;.

                              <span>An engineer has built a real-life working SPNKR rocket launcher from Halo. Best of all, it also plays the Halo theme. 


YouTuber Jairus of All is the person behind this engineering marvel, who in a nine-minute video explains how he got this thing to work (thanks, PC Gamer).


To add a cherry on top, Jairus handed over the launcher to &quot;Master Chief&quot; who fired it at a lake on the back of a Mongoose.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast - also available in audio form! - it&#x27;s all about Nintendo Switch, which is quietly having yet another brilliant year.

The last few days have seen confirmation of a new Kirby game and a Bayonetta 3 release date (finally!), adding to a solid year so far and a strong end to 2022 which will also see the likes of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Splatoon 3, Mario Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It&#x27;s a bumper crop - especially compared to this year&#x27;s lack of first-party launches on PlayStation and - most of all - Xbox.

At the same time, the way Nintendo is detailing these games is changing. Notably, there&#x27;s been no big E3 week Nintendo Direct this year, as the company keeps information on Zelda and Metroid under wraps. Is this leading to an even bigger 2023 - perhaps with new Switch hardware too? Eurogamer&#x27;s Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale and Ishraq Subhan discuss.

                              <span>Ubisoft has updated Rainbow Six Siege&#x27;s Year 7 content roadmap, and it&#x27;s not good news. 


Some of the main feature updates and quality of life improvements due to be released in Season 3 have been pushed back to Season 4.


This includes a new iteration of the Ranked mode, dubbed Ranked 2.0; restrictions on voice chat for players who are verbally abusive on mic; and the Reputation Score display beta.

Sound familiar? It certainly looks an awful lot like Mini Metro, the puzzle strategy game from New Zealand developer Dinosaur Polo Club. 


Mini Subway is available for £3.59 and has been developed by Red Fables, published by Cooking and Publishing.

DLC packs for Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2, plus Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 (except for that game&#x27;s multiplayer packs) are all now available without charge, EA has said in an email to fans shared via reddit.


Remaining BioWare Points can be spent on those Mass Effect 3 multiplayer packs (if you still have any points lying around), before they disappear forever on 11th October.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 doesn&#x27;t have turn-based combat, in a bid to appeal to a younger audience.


That&#x27;s according to producer Naoki Yoshida speaking to Famitsu (and translated by VGC) in an extensive new interview on the game.


&quot;I&#x27;m from a generation that grew up with command and turn-based RPGs,&quot; said Yoshida. &quot;I think I understand how interesting and immersive it can be. On the other hand, for the past decade or so, I&#x27;ve seen quite a number of opinions saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand the attraction of selecting commands in video games&#x27;.

                              <span>The global PC market has reportedly faced a sharp drop in shipments in the second quarter of 2022. 


According to preliminary data analysed by research firm Gartner, sales fell by 12.6 percent year-on-year to 72.01m units. 


Gartner puts the decline down to three main causes: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis caused by inflation and steep downturn in demand for Chromebooks.

                              <span>Rumbleverse - the free-to-play &quot;brawler royale&quot; from developer Iron Galaxy Studios - has, following a bit of a delay, been given a new release date, and is launching for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via the Epic Games Store) on 18th August.


Iron Galaxy Studios, which is perhaps best known as the developer behind the 2013 version of Killer Instinct, announced Rumbleverse during last year&#x27;s Game Awards, describing the 40-person, melee-focused battle royale game as &quot;big, hilarious playground where spectacular things are always happening&quot;.


It was initially due to launch into early access on 8th February this year, but Iron Galaxy opted to delay its release indefinitely, saying &quot;there&#x27;s more we want to do to perfect the experience.&quot;

                              <span>Sony has announced PlayStation Stars, a new customer loyalty programme which will launch later this year. 


Access is open to all PlayStation owners, with additional benefits for PlayStation Plus subscribers.

The build already has a multiplayer capability, which modders have enabled.

Yesterday, a claim the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game would be set in the Aztec era gained traction online, sourced from a Twitter user who had previously leaked details of fellow Ubisoft series Far Cry.


Now, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has debunked the Aztec claim - while also corroborating Eurogamer&#x27;s reporting earlier this year that Baghdad would be featured in the franchise&#x27;s next title.

The mini retro console was revealed to Japan last month, with a release date of 27th October. That&#x27;s now confirmed for North America too.



There&#x27;s no confirmed release date yet for Sega fans in other countries - presumably the name will be changed to Mega Drive Mini 2 as well.

                              <span>Researchers have a new way to de-anonymize browser users, by correlating their behavior on one account with their behavior on another:
The findings, which NJIT researchers will present at the Usenix Security Symposium in Boston next month, show how an attacker who tricks someone into loading a malicious website can determine whether that visitor controls a particular public identifier, like an email address or social media account, thus linking the visitor to a piece of potentially personal data.
When you visit a website, the page can capture your IP address, but this doesn’t necessarily give the site owner enough information to individually identify you. Instead, the hack analyzes subtle features of a potential target’s browser activity to determine whether they are logged into an account for an array of services, from YouTube and Dropbox to Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and more. Plus the attacks work against every major browser, including the anonymity-focused Tor Browser...</span>

                              <span>Immortality: An Interactive Movie Trilogy - the upcoming Hollywood-inspired  investigative horror game from Her Story and Telling Lies creator Sam Barlow - has been delayed until 30th August to &quot;ensure the experience is as polished as possible&quot;.


Immortality, which was initially due to launch on 26th July, tells the story of Marissa Marcel, a (fictional) actress who filmed three movies over the course of her career - Ambrosio in 1968, Minsky in 1970, and Two of Everything in 1999 - none of which were ever released.


As with Barlow&#x27;s previous titles, it&#x27;s a story presented in non-linear fashion that players must slowly piece together themselves by scouring through reams of FMV video. But while Her Story featured faux police interview footage and Telling Lies chose &quot;hacked&quot; webcam video as its medium of choice, Immortality asks players to dig through an archive of film and behind-the-scenes footage - using a machine resembling an old-fashioned Moviola editing device - to find out what happened to Marissa Marcel.

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge - the critically acclaimed, retro-inspired beat-em-up from developer Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu has shifted over 1m copies since it launched a little under a month ago in June.


Shredder&#x27;s Revenge has, of course, gone down a storm since its release on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan was just one of many to be won over by its charmingly reinvigorated classic side-scrolling brawling action (which comes with a bunch of pleasing mod-cons, including online co-op support for up to six players), calling it a &quot;wonderful thing, colourful, pacey, and filled with perfect Turtles music.&quot;


Clearly, with Shredder&#x27;s Revenge having now officially surpassed the 1m sales mark - as announced on Twitter - plenty of others have equally been in the mood for Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael&#x27;s retro return.

Then there&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on PS5, which includes the Yuffie-starring INTERmission episode (PS4 owners can access the original Remake game).

                              <span>A fan of the original Mass Effect has created an opening credits sequence for the game - in the style of League of Legends animated show Arcane, one of the best things on Netflix. 


Posted to reddit by user ZeoNyph, the video replaces the models of Arcane&#x27;s heroes with Mass Effect&#x27;s main characters. So, in place of Arcane&#x27;s sister stars Vi and Jynx, we have FemShep and Liara - a little generous to the latter perhaps, though both Liara and Jynx are associated with the colour blue.


Next up, there&#x27;s brief shots of boring Kaiden Alenko swapped into the place of Jayce, fan-favourite engineer fangirl Tali in the place of Viktor, and then space bro Garrus - who as a cop gets the spot of Caitlyn.

The third instalment in the Evil Dead franchise, the film sees its lead characters trapped in the Middle Ages to battle the undead.


Fittingly, this medieval-themed DLC adds a new map featuring the film&#x27;s iconic Castle Kandar - check it out in the trailer below.

It&#x27;s called &quot;Naive Angel Mode&quot; and will have the titular witch completely covered in all scenes, as well as extra coverage on her demonic form&#x27;s breasts.

Platinum Games&#x27; threequel was first announced nearly five years ago, and has been MIA for much of that time. Today&#x27;s lengthy trailer offers us a good look at the game, however. Here it is:
&quot;The titular Umbra Witch must face a mysterious evil using her signature guns and time-slowing Witch Time ability,&quot; Nintendo writes. &quot;This time, invading man-made bioweapons called Homunculi find themselves in Bayonetta&#x27;s crosshairs.&quot;

This includes the potential of any changes to the look of its main character, the cheerleader Juliet Starling, who spends the game slashing through hordes of zombies in a skimpy outfit. 


A new statement on the remake was posted to Twitter last night by producer Yoshimi Yasuda, in a bid to clear up fan confusion over several lines from the project&#x27;s original announcement.

                              <span>Cuphead&#x27;s Delicious Last Course expansion has sold 1m copies in just over a week.


The DLC was released across all platforms and adds a new island to the game, along with a host of new bosses to defeat.


By 2020, the original game had sold 6m copies, so this means a considerable portion of players have picked up the new DLC.

                              <span>The developer of EA&#x27;s upcoming Skate reboot has acknowledged the leaked early build of the game currently floating around the internet - and suggested you do not download it for yourself. 


In a blog post mentioning the leak, developer Full Circle revealed that it comprised a version of the game dating back to September 2021 that was &quot;never intended for external use&quot; - rather than a leaked playtest or demo.


&quot;While we understand you&#x27;re excited to get into the game, we encourage you to be careful when downloading files from unknown sources (and remind you of the potential consequences of breaking EA&#x27;s Terms of Service),&quot; Full Circle wrote.

At present, Partners and Affiliates only receive a payment from subscriptions, bits and more at a minimum of $100.


That&#x27;s now being reduced to $50, meaning streamers receiving smaller amounts will get their funds more frequently.

                              <span>It looks like some previously-delisted Metal Gear games are set to return on sale.


A tweet from the Japanese Metal Gear account celebrating the 35th anniversary of the series mentioned: &quot;We are preparing to resume sales of titles that have been temporarily suspended.&quot;


This likely refers to Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 which were removed from digital stores last year due to licensing issues with the historical footage utilised.

                              <span>This is an excellent essay outlining the post-Roe privacy threat model. (Summary: period tracking apps are largely a red herring.)
Taken together, this means the primary digital threat for people who take abortion pills is the actual evidence of intention stored on your phone, in the form of texts, emails, and search/web history. Cynthia Conti-Cook’s incredible article “Surveilling the Digital Abortion Diary details what we know now about how digital evidence has been used to prosecute women who have been pregnant. That evidence includes search engine history, as in the case of the prosecution of Latice Fisher in Mississippi. As Conti-Cook says, Ms. Fisher “conduct[ed] internet searches, including how to induce a miscarriage, ‘buy abortion pills, mifepristone online, misoprostol online,’ and ‘buy misoprostol abortion pill online,&#x27;” and then purchased misoprostol online. Those searches were the evidence that she intentionally induced a miscarriage. Text messages are also often used in prosecutions, as they were in the prosecution of Purvi Patel, also discussed in Conti-Cook’s article...</span>

We are excited to announce the v0.5.0 release of Gateway API. For the first
time, several of our most important Gateway API resources are graduating to
beta. Additional, we are starting a new initiative to explore how Gateway API
can be used for mesh and introducing new experimental concepts such as URL
rewrites. We&#x27;ll cover all of this and more below.
What is Gateway API?
Gateway API is a collection of resources centered around Gateway resources
(which represent the underlying network gateways / proxy servers) to enable
robust Kubernetes service networking through expressive, extensible and
role-oriented interfaces that are implemented by many vendors and have broad
industry support.

Come Season 4&#x27;s arrival, players on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation will be able to band together in order to quell the Xenomorph threat, which should help bolster the available pool of potential cohorts for faster matchmaking.


Crossplay will be accompanied by a new game mode - known as Restock Turrets - which does pretty much exactly what its name implies, challenging players to keep their turrets stocked in order to defend their position and fight off Xenomorph waves.

                              <span>Tomonobu Itagaki - the Japanese designer best known for creating Tecmo&#x27;s Dead or Alive series and rebooted Ninja Gaiden games - has announced his new company Apex Game Studios, which is currently &#x27;incubating&#x27; an NFT-focused MMORPG for mobile and PC names Warrior.


Itagaki shared his announcement on Twitter, explaining Apex Game Studios would specialise in creating &quot;high-quality and immersive&quot; triple-A &quot;Web3&quot; titles - Web 3.0 being the umbrella term incorporating (frequently controversial) technologies such as blockchain and NFT.


Apex Game Studios&#x27; first project, Warrior, is an MMORPG developed in Unreal Engine that&#x27;s due to launch in Q1 next year. Unfortunately, details remain pretty limited at this juncture, with the official website being primarily interested in detailing the NFT economy at Warrior&#x27;s core.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a familiar-looking game at the top of the iPhone app chart here in the UK, a battle royale platformer based on colourful obstacle courses and It&#x27;s a Knockout-style survival rounds.

As reported by MobileGamer.biz, Stumble Guys has been around for a while in soft launch, before exploding in popularity this year. Downloads have spiked over the past few months, with up to 1.5 million players now downloading the game per day.

Many players expected it to launch yesterday, 11th July, but it&#x27;s still not live. It should still arrive this week, though.


&quot;The team is still working on our upcoming Halo Infinite network co-op Insider flight build. While we always said our &#x27;target was the week of July 11&#x27;, many sites reported it simply as &#x27;starting July 11.&#x27; Still hoping for this week, but it will not start today,&quot; tweeted Jarrard yesterday.

On Thursday, a security researcher who goes by Kevin2600 published a technical report and videos on a vulnerability that he claims allows anyone armed with a simple hardware device to steal the code to unlock Honda vehicles. Kevin2600, who works for cybersecurity firm Star-V Lab, dubbed the attack RollingPWN.

In a phone call, Kevin2600 explained that the attack relies on a weakness that allows someone using a software defined radio—such as HackRF—to capture the code that the car owner uses to open the car, and then replay it so that the hacker can open the car as well. In some cases, he said, the attack can be performed from 30 meters (approximately 98 feet) away...</span>

                              <span>When was the last time you played a game on Facebook? Well, Meta is hoping to tempt you back to its platform with an interesting prospect: a daily, choice-based narrative experience taking place over the course of the next four months, titled The Walking Dead: Last Mile.


A massively interactive live event (MILE), the project is a collaboration between publisher Genvid, which specialises in these part-game, part-interactive stream, part-live show creations, with design and narrative input from The Walking Dead&#x27;s team at Skybound and funding from Facebook.


The big sell is that Last Mile is a new chapter of The Walking Dead&#x27;s lore, which will unfold across the next couple of months based upon decisions made by players, with the resulting narrative becoming franchise &quot;canon&quot; in line with the original comic books.  And for fans of Telltale&#x27;s The Walking Dead games, there&#x27;s a clear influence in art style and design language, if not gameplay.

                              <span>A new novel based in the Halo universe is coming to stores on 9th August.
This book, which is called Halo: The Rubicon Protocol, will act as a prequel to Halo Infinite and tells of the six months before Master Chief wakes up and the game&#x27;s campaign begins.
It sounds like this will offer up some useful bits of background information for those who started Halo Infinite and found themselves a touch confused by what exactly was going on. While some of this history can be picked up in-game thanks to some well-placed audio logs, it could definitely be made clearer for players from the off.

The ongoing effects of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine have left the project&#x27;s announcement in &quot;limbo&quot;, Venturebeat&#x27;s Jeff Grubb has said, writing on Twitter that &quot;GoldenEye is still in limbo because of the war&quot;. 
Eurogamer also understands this to be accurate. We have contacted Microsoft for further comment.

Along with this new mod for The Elder Scrolls 5, the Together team has also shared a little update about its purpose. Calling it a &quot;passion project&quot; by a small handful of volunteers, the developer revealed it had tested it out with &quot;30+ players&quot;, although this did not strictly make it an MMO. 
&quot;The aim of the mod is to develop a true Skyrim multiplayer experience that brings online multiplayer into this otherwise strictly single player game,&quot; the Together team explained, stating it is aimed for use by two to eight players at a time.

                              <span>Yes, there&#x27;s another weird and wonderful way to play through Elden Ring - playing the piano.


Omunchkin13 posted a video over on reddit of his Elden Ring completion using a piano as a controller.


While the piano still plays music, don&#x27;t expect a full concerto - it&#x27;s more experimental jazz - but this is still a very impressive feat.

Abe, the highly-respected former leader of Japan, died last week in a shooting that shocked Japan and prompted international outcry. A 41-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene. 


Over the weekend, internet users began to circulate an old photograph of Kojima online, identifying the image as that of the suspect.

                              <span>Low sales of the Wii U weren&#x27;t the only reason Nintendo decided to not offer dual GamePad support on its somewhat underwhelming console. The decision was also due to a general lack of suitable games to actually make its implementation worthwhile, former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has said.
Speaking to MinnMax, Fils-Aimé stated: 
&quot;What was interesting is that with the Wii U, there was a full development plan for all of the interesting interactions and all of the interesting capabilities that the system could do, and so in that case, technically could multiple gamepads communicate with a Wii U? Answer was &#x27;yes&#x27;, but the install base never got large enough that that type of implementation made sense.&quot;

                              <span>There was a massive prison break in Abuja, Nigeria:
Armed with bombs, Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPGs) and General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG), the attackers, who arrived at about 10:05 p.m. local time, gained access through the back of the prison, using dynamites to destroy the heavily fortified facility, freeing 600 out of the prison’s 994 inmates, according to the country’s defense minister, Bashir Magashi….

What’s interesting to me is how the defenders got the threat model wrong. That attack isn’t normally associated with a prison break; it sounds more like a military action in a civil war...</span>

                              <span>Professional gamer Philip &quot;ImperialHal&quot; Dosen hit the headlines this weekend after he held off from shooting an opponent in a competitive match when he realised the enemy player had been disconnected.

As spotted by Apex Legends Intel, ImperialHal was competing in the Apex Legends Global Series 2022 - a championship with a cool $2 million up for grabs - when he spied a lone player off in the distance. After monitoring them for a couple of seconds, he told his TSM teammates: &quot;Dont shoot him. Don&#x27;t shoot him, bro! He&#x27;s crashed&quot;.

In a tweet on his personal Twitter account, Robert Morrison - whose credits also include Resident Evil 7, Injustice 2, and Santa Monica Studios&#x27; 2018 God of War reboot - countered such claims by insisting it is &quot;the most meticiously built and crafted project&quot; that&#x27;s had &quot;the highest level of care and attention to detail possible&quot;.

Animator Morrison - who worked on The Last of Us Part 1 and now works at fellow Sony studio, Bend - said: &quot;Actually, it’s the most meticulously built and crafted project that I have ever seen or been a part of in my entire career.

                              <span>Surprise! Valve has pushed out another update for its beleaguered bot-ladened shooter, Team Fortress 2.

Whilst not quite as impactful as the last patch, the game&#x27;s Steam page explains how the update hopes to address &quot;exploits and stability issues&quot;.

The long bulletpointed list includes mostly quality of life (QoL) fixes, but some new game server settings will now enable server operator to &quot;limit the amount of processing time the gamer server can spend on processing packets for each client per tick&quot;. Clients that send packets causing server CPU processing time to exceed the configured number of milliseconds will be kicked.

Known only as &quot;Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title&quot;, the game is clearly in the very early stages, but already the team is looking to bring a host of new developers on to what seems to be a singleplayer shooter that will be a &quot;brand new Respawn single-player adventure&quot;.

Respawn&#x27;s careers page, first noticed by Dextero, is currently hiring for numerous projects, including Apex Legends, its Mobile equivalent, the upcoming Star Wars FPS, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Fallen Order&#x27;s recently announced sequel. But also included in the list is that Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title, too.

                              <span>Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion will reportedly run at 120fps on PC.

That&#x27;s according to producer Mariko Sato, who told IGN (via NME) that the remaster will be &quot;visually aligned and up to the standards of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake&quot;, meaning it should run at 120fps on PC, and 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X.

As for Nintendo Switch? Sato reportedly didn&#x27;t expand on that, only saying that there would be “differences” in the resolution and FPS on Nintendo&#x27;s handheld system.

                              <span>Blizzard has confirmed that it will be tweaking both Mercy and Symmetra in the Overwatch 2 beta mid-cycle patch.

In a blog on the official website, Blizzard said that the team has been hard at work &quot;compiling player feedback, [and] squashing bugs&quot;, and revealed that part of this will be revisiting Mercy&#x27;s changes in light of fan feedback.

Healer Mercy received some minor nerfs when the beta test kicked off, such as her character automatically launching into the air when reaching an ally. Now, however, Blizzard is changing it so that you can decide if and when to jump… even though it seems as though that particular ability was a complete accident in the first place.

                              <span>A new leak has given us an early peek at what games may be coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium next month.

According to ResetEra&#x27;s BlackBate - a mysterious poster who&#x27;s correctly leaked games ahead of schedule before - it looks like subscribers to Sony&#x27;s top two PS+ tiers will see the following games join the collection: Stray (which ties in with what we already knew), FFVII Remake Intergrade + FF7R EPISODE INTERmission, Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV Black Flag, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Rogue Remastered, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Freedom Cry, Assassin&#x27;s Creed The Ezio Collection, and Saints Row IV: Re-Elected.

BlackBate reckons the games will join the PS Plus library on 19th July - yes, Stray&#x27;s release date - and states that these are only &quot;some of the games&quot;, perhaps hinting there are more to come.

Megill - who was previously lead writer for the project and is who we have to &quot;thank&quot; for those nightmareish puppets in Control - made the announcement on Twitter, saying she had some &quot;exciting news to end the week&quot;.

Megill&#x27;s CV is an impressive one, featuring story-rich games such as Control - for which she was also narrative lead - Dishonored: Death of the Outsider, and Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

                              <span>Blizzard is celebrating the recent seventh anniversary of its MOBA Heroes of the Storm by trimming development in order to focus only &quot;on client sustainability and bug fixing&quot;. 

In a brief update posted yesterday on the official website, Blizzard said it would now treat the MOBA in a &quot;manner similar to our other longstanding games, StarCraft and StarCraft II&quot; by continuing seasonal rolls and hero rotations, but with no plans for new &quot;for-purchase content to be added&quot;.

As a thank you to all who&#x27;ve stuck with the game, Blizzard is offering the &quot;incredibly rare&quot; Epic Arcane Lizard mount to all players with next week’s patch.

                              <span>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt&#x27;s summer update will rollout on 14th July, bringing a host of new features, including a new 8v8 Team Deathmatch mode and a refreshed battle pass system.

This new Team Deathmatch sees four duos duking it out to take control of five arenas across the Prague map, whilst the new Summer pass - offering 100 &quot;levels of progression&quot; - will be available for &quot;only&quot; 600 tokens. 

Sharkmob also confirms that instead of the &quot;standard&quot; 12-week battle pass, Bloodhunt will now focus on monthly content drops instead.

                              <span>Bungie has marked Bungie Day with the release of a limited edition NERF gun styled after Destiny&#x27;s iconic rocket launcher, the Gjallarhorn.

At one meter/four feet long, it&#x27;s a &quot;faithful&quot; 1:1 replication that includes an illuminated scope and comes in &quot;premium showpiece packaging, covered with intricate details inspired from Destiny lore&quot;.

&quot;In addition to capturing the look of this overpowering launcher, the NERF LMTD Gjallarhorn blaster includes the first-ever NERF Mega dart shells, which each hold 3 NERF Mega darts and fire 3 darts at a time,&quot; Bungie explains. &quot;Load a shell into the breech, prime, and pull the trigger to send all 3 darts bursting from the blaster. The NERF Gjallarhorn blaster includes 3 shells and 9 darts.&quot;

Out on 13th July as part of Update 18.2 - initially just for PC, I&#x27;m afraid; the console release will follow on 21st July - Deston includes a flooded downtown, a swamp, coastlines, &quot;one of the tallest skyscrapers in the game&quot; as well as the Lodge, the &quot;biggest building ever made&quot; in the game.

                              <span>IO Ineractive has given us a first look at the new level coming to Hitman 3, known as Ambrose Island.
Agent 47 is certainly not one to stay put for long, and he is now readying himself for his next holiday (sorry, I mean mission). While many of us can only dream of having the opportunity to see the world as readily as he does, for Agent 47 this is all just part of a standard day. So, what of his next destination? 
Well, once you set yours and 47&#x27;s feet onto the tropical isles of Ambrose Island you will most definitely be stepping into dangerous territory. In fact, you will be stepping into pirate territory. So, you had better get ready for your buckles to be swashed. You can check out the new reveal trailer below.

                              <span>Rockstar has told fans not to expect any further major updates for Red Dead Online, as it continues to shift development resource towards Grand Theft Auto 6.


It&#x27;s bad news for Red Dead Online players, who have for some time complained the game had been underserved and overlooked by Rockstar in comparison to the more lucrative GTA Online. 


Now, Rockstar has laid out its plan to keep Red Dead Online on life support and acknowledged its greater focus on GTA6.

A new trailer for the upcoming release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has given us all a closer look at gameplay. Here, we see the titular Gollum scaling walls, skulking in the shrubbery, and popping off orcs with rocks. 
We also get to have a closer look at some of the other characters from Middle-earth. These include Gandalf and the elven king Thranduil, a mysterious new elf (who I suspect may be Mel from the preview I was invited to earlier this year), the Nazgûl and the eight-legged wonder Shelob. You can check it out for yourself below.

Previously-announced plans to make Facebook logins a requirement for Meta VR headsets had been hugely unpopular and plagued with problems. 


Now, we know roughly when and how an alternative plan will be put into practice: in August, and via the launch of a fresh, pared-back account system with a separate social profile named Meta Horizon.

Now videos from the playtest have popped up on reddit, giving everyone a look at the game.

                              <span>Hot off the heels of The Quarry, another horror-filled game from Supermassive is coming our way. This time, we&#x27;re heading back to its Dark Pictures series, with The Devil in Me.
A new trailer for this upcoming release has given us two things. The first is a launch window of this autumn. The second is an unnerving look at the game&#x27;s Saw-like story, which sees a group of film makers make their way to to a replica of the &#x27;Murder House&#x27; of HH Holmes, America&#x27;s first serial killer. Obviously, things are not going to go smoothly for our group of intrepid young&#x27;uns.
Unlike previous entries in its Dark Pictures series, The Devil in Me does not appear going down the paranormal or supernatural route. Rather, it looks to be rooted in a pretty grim but very believable reality akin to the aforementioned Saw and the Hostel series of films. There are traps for our unsuspecting victims to trigger, there&#x27;re torture rooms, there is tension, and there are some creepy-as mannequins. You can see for yourself below.

RoboCop: Rogue City will be a first-person shooter, and of the two new games looks to be one we&#x27;ll see launch first - in June 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Let&#x27;s take a look:

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra said his company wanted &quot;to return to a live event that enables us to celebrate the community&quot; and was &quot;committed to bringing back BlizzCon&quot; next year.

                              <span>Staff at Activision Blizzard are planning a walkout next month, in light of the &quot;recent attacks on the civil liberties of [its] employees&quot;.
&quot;We are calling for protection of several communities of marginalised workers. Employees are actively facing state legislation that is putting women, LGBTQ+ employees, and their families at risk, with other vulnerable groups on the horizon,&quot; wrote works group ABetterABK via Twitter.
&quot;Our walk-out demands focus on the protections of ABK employees from external threats like the recent overturn of Roe v Wade, and internal threats such as retaliation and harassment while in the workplace.&quot;

                              <span>Mike Ybarra, the head of Blizzard, has spoken out about the controversial microtransactions found in Diablo Immortal. 

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Ybarra implied that complaints surrounding Diablo Immortal&#x27;s in-game purchases were limited to a small minority, and indeed, that Blizzard had specifically designed its free-to-play experience so the majority of players would still enjoy the bulk of the game. 


Ybarra pointed to the game&#x27;s high rating and number of positive reviews on the App Store, and suggested these contrasted with  some of the negative headlines and complaints which have been reported.

That&#x27;s thanks to the new Data Centre Travel system that allows players to visit other worlds - it was so popular it was taken down soon after it launched but is now back up.


Balmung is known for its roleplayers, notoriously of a more erotic kind, and has seen an influx of players visiting.

&quot;We have a special treat for you this month,&quot; started 343 community writer Alex Wakeford in a very in-depth blog post yesterday.
&quot;Something that becomes part of the great journey of many Halo fans is learning about all the stuff that didn&#x27;t make it into the games over the years,&quot; he teased before revealing, &quot;I can confirm we are working on a rebuild of the original E3 Earthcity scenario that makes it playable in modern retail Halo 2.&quot;

Details on what exactly Microsoft will show remain vague, other than a promise we&#x27;ll see updates on previously-announced games set to be released over the coming 12 months.


This is a similar-sounding promise to what we saw recently at the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase, which concluded with new gameplay footage of Starfield.

The player became notorious in the Elden Ring community for assisting players with the game&#x27;s infamously tricky Malenia boss, defeating her a thousand times.



In response, Bandai Namco sent the player a boxed sword, complete with map scroll and wooden plaque, with the message: &quot;Congratulations on your great accomplishment&quot;.

                              <span>After months of downtime, the Wii Shop Channel and the DSi Shop are back available to access. 


Both digital stores were quietly made inaccessible back in March. When asked about their status at the time, Nintendo subsequently told Eurogamer the stores were &quot;undergoing maintenance&quot;, and no date was given for their return. 


Indeed, some fans had begun wondering if the stores would ever return at all.

Sharing the news on Twitter, the Falls Guys devs wrote, &quot;We&#x27;re in absolute disbelief... 50 million players in 2 weeks!!!&quot;
 The team reiterated its disbelief at such impressive numbers by following on with, &quot;U N B E L I E V A B L E THANKS EVERYONE!&quot;

                              <span>Report by Georgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technology published a comprehensive report on the surprising amount of mass surveillance conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</span>

                              <span>The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has investigated complaints regarding adverts that appeared in the free-to-play Scrabble Go app. 
According to complainants, the ads in question made light of sexual assault, even going so far as to actively encourage it. 
The first ad to be reported was for a mobile game app from OneSoft Studio named Naughty Puzzle: Tricky Test. It showed an animated woman wearing what appeared to be short shorts and a vest top struggling to free herself from a broken fence.

                              <span>It sounds a lot like Marvel&#x27;s Avengers will get She-Hulk as a playable character. 


The detail was dropped rather unexpectedly last night, as part of an official Xbox Twitch livestream for the game featuring streamer Frank &quot;Techniq&quot; Ellerbe and Marvel&#x27;s Avengers lead designer Brian Waggoner. 


In an off-the-cuff comment, Ellerbe claimed his acting coach was actually the voice of She-Hulk in the game, to the obvious surprise of Waggoner - who stated that the character had not yet been officially confirmed.

In fact, you only have a few more days, as the Unreal Engine 5 tech demo will be removed from Xbox series X/S and PlayStation 5 stores on 9th July. 
So, if you want to have a whirl in its bustling and hyper-realistic world, you had better get a wiggle on.

Naka posted the photo on Twitter for the game&#x27;s 26th anniversary, but Ohshima has been edited out of the image.


Why? It all relates to controversy where Naka was removed as director from Balan Wonderworld, a game he worked on with Ohshima.

                              <span>Rockstar Games had plans to release a remaster of both Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 4, a new report has claimed. 
However, in light of the pretty poor reception following its GTA trilogy release last year (yes, I am being generous here), the company has now apparently put these ideas to one side.
Sources with knowledge of Rockstar&#x27;s inner workings have now confirmed to Kotaku that recent rumours to this effect were indeed true, and we were meant to be getting a shiny new upgrade for both games. Last year&#x27;s release of the GTA trilogy came as a real blow to Rockstar, however, and now the company is hoping to put all of that bad press behind it.

                              <span>After a three-year hiatus due to Covid, Pokémon Go&#x27;s in-person Go Fests have properly returned. The first of three music festival-sized city gatherings took place this weekend in Berlin and went off smoothly, with the usual mix of rare creatures, boosted Shiny chances and early access to new species.


As ever, it was the feeling of playing Pokémon Go among thousands of others that made the event something special. Along the many pretty paths circling Berlin&#x27;s beautiful Britzer Garden, thousands of Pokémon players plodded along in groups, with friends or in couples, celebrating rare catches or looking on in envy. 


I wasn&#x27;t certain about Berlin as a choice for Go Fest, after the smaller German city of Dortmund hosted the game&#x27;s main European events in previous years so successfully. Not only did Dortmund have a great city park to play in, but its main centre was small enough that when Pokémon Go players turned up, they absolutely took over - fans flooding its small squares and filling restaurant terraces. It created a carnival atmosphere, and seeing the expressions of bemused locals as dozens of people passed by in Pikachu onesies never got old.

                              <span>We will no longer be getting any Xbox 360 games included with Games with Gold as of this October. 
This is due to the fact that Microsoft has now &quot;reached the limit of [its] ability&quot; for adding new Xbox 360 games to the service, Microsoft stated in an email to customers seen by Eurogamer. 
All is not lost though, as we will still be getting the usual monthly offering of Xbox One games.

&quot;Squid Research Lab here with a meaty discovery - this is rare imagery of a new multiplayer stage,&quot; the Splatoon team tweeted. 
&quot;The facility was made FROM scrap metal in order to make MORE scrap metal. Also, there was a sea here that evaporated. Surely unrelated to heavy industry [ahem]!&quot;

The sale of games, consoles and subscription services contributed to a enormous $191bn global total in 2021, which will fall slightly to $188bn this year, according to Ampere Analysis. 


This follows extraordinary growth through the early stages of the pandemic, with a leap in spending especially noticable from 2020 onwards.

Job adverts for a Destiny project were previously spotted last year by The Game Post. Required skills included a &quot;willingness to travel to China&quot; on a regular basis, and host Chinese partner teams. 

NetEase invested $100m in Bungie back in 2018, though the companies have never officially confirmed what the two are working on.

In addition to this, the company also revealed that Monster Hunter Rise itself has also passed 10m units sold since its release.
Capcom equates these figures to &quot;a variety of measures including ongoing free updates and the launch of a PC version, as well as with the release of a set that includes Sunbreak.&quot;

                              <span>A fan made video focusing on 2013&#x27;s The Last of Us highlights some of the most impressive details hidden within the game that many may have missed.


Ahead of The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s release for the PS5 (and eventually PC), content creator Speclizer has revisited the first game in Naughty Dog&#x27;s post-apocalyptic world.


They have since shared a compilation of the incredible inclusions from Naughty Dog, many of which can be easily missed on your average playthrough. I am talking about things like Joel&#x27;s buttons being embossed with the words &quot;Naughty Button&quot; or being able to spot Tess&#x27; bite before she reveals her infection.

                              <span>Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End&#x27;s Madagascan jeep chase almost featured a stunt made famous during Sean Connery&#x27;s sixth outing as James Bond (I mean, why not, Drake does look pretty sharp in a dinner jacket after all).
The stunt in question comes from the 1971 film Diamonds are Forever, where Sean Connery&#x27;s Bond tips his vehicle onto two wheels to get through a tight gap (something those in pursuit are, of course, unable to pull off). 
&quot;We actually prototyped doing that [during A Thief&#x27;s End&#x27;s jeep chase],&quot; Uncharted 4&#x27;s co-lead designer Kurt Margenau reflected during a recent chat with Couch Soup. However, as those who have played the game will know, this idea did not ultimately make the final cut.

                              <span>This weekend&#x27;s major Call of Duty leak points to a Gulf War-era setting for the next Black Ops, fans have said.


The huge cache of leaked information - apparently gleaned from the files of a Warzone Mobile alpha build - detailed elements from several upcoming games, including the next release from Black Ops studio Treyarch, due in 2024.


Details were posted to Twitter by user RealiityUK, whose account has now been suspended, though a description of what was posted remains on reddit.

The bundle is in direct response to the overturning of Roe v Wade, key US legislation that grants individuals the right to an abortion. 


The bundle contains over 750 games from over 600 creators available for a minimum donation of $10. Estimated value is over $3k.

Previously, an infamous bug when playing on a PC with a multicore processor (as most modern PCs have) would cause the audio to skip and the game to crash, making it all but unplayable.


Now, the creators of the Enhanced Edition have fixed the issue by implementing a custom streaming audio engine.

Technoblade, real name Alex, had amassed 13 million followers over years of creating Minecraft content. He was just 23.


His passing prompted an outpouring of messages from fellow streamers and esports players, as well as acknowledgement from Mojang itself. Now, the developer has gone further and updated Minecraft Java Edition&#x27;s launch screen with a nod to Technoblade&#x27;s YouTube icon - a crowned Minecraft pig.

                              <span>Political parties in the Netherlands have broadly backed a new attempt to block the sale of video game loot boxes in the country.


Six parties say they will support the motion, which would bring Dutch law largely in line with Belgium - where loot boxes were outlawed back in 2018 (thanks, Neowin).


The motion describes loot boxes as &quot;a form of gambling&quot; and states &quot;children in video games are manipulated to purchase&quot; such items via in-game microtransactions.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise numbers are soaring on Steam following the release of the Sunbreak expansion.


At the time of release on PC in January this year, the game had a concurrent player count of 134,262; now that&#x27;s close to doubling at 231,360 - and it continues to rise.


Sunbreak is a huge new expansion to the game, adding master rank hunts, a plethora of new items, and returning monsters to defeat.

                              <span>Netflix has shared the opening credit sequence for its upcoming anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.
First debuted at the Anime Expo 2022 in Los Angeles, these opening credits are accompanied by Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s &#x27;This Fffire&#x27; from 2004. (A small spot of trivia for your next pub quiz, this is not the only piece of game-inspired media to feature this song. The earlier released and self-produced &#x27;This Fire&#x27; can also be found on the soundtrack from Burnout 3: Takedown.)
Anyway, I digress. Back to Edgerunners, and its new credit sequence which you can check out for yourself below.

Like the versions on other consoles, it will be cross-platform compatible and free-to-play, and carry the &quot;New Genesis&quot; sub-title with fully localised text and character voices in English (thanks, Polygon).

Digimon Survive - which &quot;blends visual novel storytelling with tactical battle elements&quot; - has been a long time coming, having been formally delayed three times to &quot;allocate more time to development&quot; and &quot;enhance the quality of the game&quot;.

Featuring over 100 Digimon, this latest game in the Digimon series features a world map that is divided into areas and locations which you will need to scan in order to find  &quot;glitches&quot; for clues and items.

As spotted by ResetEra, Twitter user @RealiityUK - although they&#x27;ve had other accounts taken offline by DMCA strikes - shared the images over the weekend, posting a full thread of what seem to be loading screens from the shooter which they say were discovered in Warzone Mobile test files. 

If true, they show that the multiplayer upcoming maps from Modern Warfare 2 will include a Grand Prix, an oil field, and a museum, as well as others called Codename: SABA, and Hydro.

&quot;At Sega, we stand for equality and believe in the ability to make choices about one&#x27;s body is a human right,&quot; the brief statement, posted yesterday on Twitter.

Most of the games included on the list are getting on a bit, but three-year-old VR game Space Junkies is also getting pulled, and as its a &quot;multiplayer-only title&quot;, you will be &quot;unable to play the game going forward&quot;.

Whilst the singleplayer features for these games will mostly be unaffected, multiplayer modes or online features may be unavailable after 1st September, along with the ability to buy DLC.

As Victoria so perfectly summarised for us at the time, yesterday was a sad day. In less than 24 hours, we got the news that Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert was no longer going to talk about the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island following online abuse, and God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s producer had to ask everyone to remain patient while waiting for more news on the game after we learned that some members of the God of War Ragnarök team were receiving unsolicited pictures of their private parts. 

Consequently, Santa Monica Studio today issued a formal statement about the incident via its social media channels.

                              <span>Two developers that had been working on a Fallout mod have been offered jobs by Bethesda.

In a statement posted on Twitter, the lead technical adviser and project manager of Fallout: London, a &quot;DLC-sized&quot; mod for Fallout 4, have both been offered jobs; the former as an associate level designer, and the latter a chance to work on Fallout 76. 

Ryan Johnson took up the new job as an associate level designer, albeit only after ensuring his &quot;expected level design tasks&quot; for the mod were complete and succession planning was in place. Dean Carter, however, decided not to take the Fallout 76 position as they wanted to &quot;continue working [on] Fallout: London until the end&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to the website Playing for the Planet, an UN-led initiative which seeks to use games to &quot;inspire young people to learn and act in support of the environment&quot;.

For instance, for Riders Republic, Ubisoft says it will host a &quot;short and intense&quot; in-game event in Phoenix which will promote &quot;strategies to reduce wildfire frequency and size as well as have an emotional impact on players regarding the consequences of wildfires&quot;.

                              <span>The Quarry&#x27;s community has come up with a way for players to get hold of the Hard Pass accolade across platforms, something that was seemingly unobtainable due to a known issue.
Publisher 2K revealed last month that there was an issue &quot;causing the Hard Pass achievement/trophy to not be rewarded as intended&quot;. The team is looking to get this sorted in an upcoming patch, but until then, players looking to get this award can trick the game into working as it should.
General warning, there are some small spoilers for The Quarry below.

Revealed in today&#x27;s Letter from the Producer stream, the new mode will be &quot;relaxing solo content&quot; that allows players to gather resources, care for creatures, build facilities, and earn special currency to purchase items.


Patch 6.2 will be called Buried Memory and is set for release in late August 2022.

The changes were revealed in a new Twitch Patch Notes stream that detailed forthcoming features.


The tag system will soon be updated so that streamers can create custom tags. What&#x27;s more, the maximum limit will increase from five to 10.

                              <span>Yesterday was a sad day in the gaming industry. In less than 24 hours, we got the news that Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert was no longer going to talk about the upcoming release of Return to Monkey Island following online abuse, and God of War Ragnarök&#x27;s producer had to ask everyone to remain patient while waiting for more news on the game.
It has since transpired that some members of the gaming community have even been sending unsolicited pictures of their private parts to members of the God of War Ragnarök team. They somehow believed that this would suddenly make Sony Santa Monica give the world an update on the game&#x27;s release date... How they came to this conclusion is beyond me.
Since all of this has happened, prominent members from the industry have been making their voices heard and have called out the toxic behaviour of these so-called fans.

In the absence of social features in its games, Campfire will act as a companion app.

                              <span>Cult classic cel-shaded shooter XIII was famously remade, and subsequently widely panned, in 2020. However, the remake is getting a second chance, as it is now being basically remade again.
A new statement on the game’s Steam page reads: &quot;To achieve the quality standards and offer an optimal gaming experience, Microids decided to entrust the development of XIII Remake to the French studio Tower Five (Lornsword: Winter Chronicle). Hard at work for more than a year on a major update. This update will be released on September 13th.
&quot;On that date, owners of the game will receive a free update and enjoy the game as intended. The development studio reworked the entire game from the Art Direction to the AI and added numerous technical improvements&quot; (via Kotaku).

                              <span>A Nintendo fan reportedly spent 5m yen (around £30k) on Nintendo stock to ask the company about a potential F-Zero sequel in an annual shareholder meeting.


During the meeting, which took place on Tuesday, the shareholder asked Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa if the company would consider making new games or remakes of its dormant series, specifically F-Zero.


As translated by VGC, Furukawa replied: &quot;It is realistically difficult to develop new titles and remakes, including sequels, for every Nintendo game that people request, but we are very grateful and appreciate the expectations our fans have for our games.&quot;

                              <span>GOG has reinstated Blade Runner: ScummVM edition following a fan outcry.


Last month, Nightdive Studios released its critically-panned remaster of Westwood Studios&#x27; classic point-and-click adventure, delisting the popular fan-made effort in the process.


While buying the Enhanced Edition from GOG also got you the original version, fans slammed the troubled remaster in user reviews, giving it an overall rating of 1.5 stars out of five.

In a note to press, Konami said Inter Milan will feature exclusively within eFootball &quot;and no other video game&quot; from July 2024.


That means Inter Milan won&#x27;t be in that year&#x27;s EA Sports FC (EA will ditch the FIFA brand from 2023).

                              <span>Maxis continues to tick those much-requested Sims 4 features off the list as fans wait impatiently for news of the Sims 5, with the developer having now confirmed it&#x27;ll finally be giving teen Sims a proper education in its newly announced High School Years Expansion Pack, due 28th July.


High School Years, which follows the release of The Sim 4&#x27;s excellent Werewolves Game Pack earlier this month, does pretty much exactly what you&#x27;d assume it does based on its name, giving players the option to send teenage Sims off to Copperdale High for a few years of learning and post-class socialising with peers.


Its first big addition is the new location of Copperdale. Nestled on the banks of Lake LaSuli, this small town plays home to more than just the local high school; it also incorporates a library, the principal&#x27;s lavish mansion, a thrift store/boba hangout known as ThrifTea, and an amusement park, complete with haunted house, tunnel of love, ferris wheel, and photo booth.

                              <span>Earlier this week, news broke of a modder that hacked AMD&#x27;s FSR 2.0 temporal upscaling technology into Cyberpunk 2077, allowing users of non-RTX graphics cards the chance to play the game at higher frame-rates with substantially better visual quality than with FSR 1.0 upscaling. That&#x27;s massive for owners of AMD GPUs, and the mod even works beautifully on Steam Deck. 
We contacted the mod&#x27;s creator, the gloriously named PotatoOfDoom1337, to find out exactly how it works - and whether it means that FSR 2.0 will soon be available in a tonne of existing games. Here&#x27;s the interview, edited lightly for clarity. Enjoy!

What&#x27;s your background in programming and game modding? On NexusMods, it looks like you&#x27;ve only been creating mods since April last year?

It&#x27;s from Sabotage, the team behind ninja-platformer The Messenger, and features some truly stunning pixel art.


Sabotage was aiming for a 2022 release, but a new statement on Twitter reveals that&#x27;s been pushed back to 2023.

That means we could see the likes of Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Catherine following in the footsteps of Sonic the Hedgehog and his recent film success.

IGN reports that for Sega, expanding storytelling forms is a new and important part of its business strategy.

&quot;The town of Redfall is under siege by a legion of vampires who have cut the island off from the outside world,&quot; the description reads. &quot;Trapped with a handful of survivors, choose from a roster of heroes to create the perfect team of vampire slayers and take back Redfall.&quot;
Said heroes are Layla Ellison (the &quot;telekinetic threat student in debt), Devinder &quot;Dev&quot; Crousley (the &quot;verified cryptid hunter&quot;), Jacob Boyer (the &quot;deadeye with an undead eye&quot;) and Remi de la Rosa (the &quot;ingenious ingeniera&quot;).

First spotted on the XboxSeriesX subreddit, the game was listed on the &quot;Recently added&quot; selection despite no official announcement by Microsoft. 


The official store page for the game on Xbox confirms that the game is indeed on Game Pass.

                              <span>Kirby and the Forgotten Land was a colourful and welcome splash of fun on its release in March. One of its most adorable features (of which there are many) was the ever-evolving Waddle Dee Town, which has its own café. 
At this café, you can purchase a selection of eats to help Kirby on his quest to free the Waddle Dees, including the Car-Mouth Cake. This cake will cost Kirby 20 coins and will recover some health. But, let&#x27;s be honest, its reviving properties are not what we really love about it. What we really love is the fact that it is an adorable, edible Carby.
Now, the Kirby Café in Tokyo and Hakata in Japan has updated its menus to include a real Car-Mouth Cake for us to enjoy (I mean, if we are ever in the area).

Then a third banner arose from the crowd: Mae Borowski, the anthropomorphic cat from Night in the Woods.

The aim of Bill 96 is to strengthen the French-speaking province&#x27;s language laws, ensuring French is the main language spoken in everything from business to healthcare.


However, it&#x27;s feared this will drive away non-French speakers from Québec&#x27;s considerable video game industry.

                              <span>Valve has downplayed the performance impact of using slower SSDs in new shipments of the Steam Deck. 


The change was first spotted by German publication HardwareLuxx, which noticed the 256 GB and 512 GB versions of the Steam Deck now ship with either a two-lane or four-lane PCIe Gen 3 SSD. Previously, these versions all came with a faster four-lane SSD. 


Asked by PC Gamer for comment, Valve&#x27;s product designer Lawrence Yang said Valve &quot;determined  that there is no impact to performance between the two models,&quot; and there were only differences between the two drives in &quot;extremely uncommon cases.&quot;

The original Overwatch wasn&#x27;t updated to natively support the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, so there&#x27;s huge expectation that the sequel will bring the latest and greatest tech features.


Beta players have reported that the game will be able to run at 120 FPS with variable refresh rate (VRR) support. That&#x27;s a huge upgrade for console players who have been locked to 60 FPS on last-gen consoles.

&quot;If it were up to me, I would share all the information when I know about it. But it is not up to me,&quot; he tweeted (with a mellow looking Baby Yoda to accompany his message). 
&quot;So please, be patient. I promise things will be shared at the earliest possible moment they can be. We make games for you. We get to make games because of you.&quot;

Kotaku initially reported the news of the game development engine company.

In a statement to Axios’ Stephen Totilo, Blizzard explained that Overwatch 2 “will replace the current Overwatch build,” with all player-unlocked content automatically transferring across games.

The picture came from Bit Planet Games, the developer of Ultrawings and its follow up Ultrawings 2. It showed the PS VR2 on a black leather chair.
It wasn&#x27;t much, with the set not even being in use for the photo, but it was enough to quickly catch the ever-watching eyes of the internet before the developer had a chance to remove the post without anyone noticing it. You can see it for yourself below (via Reddit).

                              <span>Pokémon  Go developer Niantic has reportedly fire 85 to 90 members of its staff and cancelled four of its in-development projects - including a previously announced Transformers game and a collaboration with theatre company Punchdrunk - amid &quot;economic turmoil&quot; for the company.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which has shared portions of an email sent to Niantic staff by the company&#x27;s chief executive officer John Hanke.
In the message, Hanke is said to have blamed today&#x27;s project cancellations and redundancies - which will affect around 8% of Niantic&#x27;s workforce - on the company facing &quot;a time of economic turmoil&quot;. Hanke reportedly claimed the moves would help &quot;further streamline our operations in order to best position the company to weather any economic storms that may lie ahead.&quot;

                              <span>RimWorld, developer Ludeon Studios&#x27; widely acclaimed sci-fi colony sim, will finally be making the jump to consoles - some three and a half years after its full PC release - on 29th July.


RimWorld has, of course, made quite the mark on PC since its early access arrival all the way back in 2013 - partly for its wonderfully rich blend of management sim action and procedural storytelling, but equally for the way its complex systems can quickly tumble into outright debauchery, ranging from drug-fuelled cannibalism to non-consensual body harvesting.


Word that a console version of RimWorld was finally on the way arrived in March, although notably not through official channels. Instead, the port - being handled by Double Eleven Limited, which has previously helped port the likes of Minecraft Dungeons and Rust to consoles - hit headlines when it was listed as having been refused classification in Australia.

Tri-Ace, the studio that&#x27;s been at the helm of the Star Ocean series since its debut in 1996, is once again handling development duties on The Divine Force, which this time follows the stories of dual protagonists Raymond, the captain of the space trading ship Ydas, and Laeticia, the princess-knight of a kingdom on the underdeveloped planet of Aster IV.


Each character offers its own story perspectives and gameplay experiences, and there&#x27;s a taste of Star Ocean: The Divine Force&#x27;s ensuing action in the new trailer accompanying today&#x27;s news.

                              <span>Ubisoft has today unveiled a feast of fresh Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope gameplay footage, showcasing its intriguing new settings, characters and chaos.


This sequel to the excellent Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle takes place in a &quot;whimsical&quot; and gorgeous new galaxy, that&#x27;s a curious blend of both Mario Galaxy and Rabbids universes. Within its orbit float worlds of autumnal colour, frozen snow and sandy beaches, like a Mario Galaxy game in miniature.


The story here revolves around Cursa, a dark entity that wants to absorb this hybrid galaxy&#x27;s energy and capture the Sparks - cute creations that are a mix of Galaxy&#x27;s Lumas and the Rabbids. It&#x27;s up to Mario and his Kingdom Battle crew to save the day, now aided by Rabbid Rosalina, the punky-looking rabbid Edge, and - as we found out yesterday during the latest Nintendo Direct - Bowser himself.

The first discovery came from self-proclaimed &quot;Switch tinkerer&quot; OatmealDome. In this case, the modder managed to unearth some Half-Life 2 content tucked away in the Portal: Companion Collection&#x27;s files.
&quot;The entirety of Half-Life 2 (minus maps and music) is present in the ROM,&quot; they wrote via Twitter. &quot;Likely based on the NVIDIA Shield port, with a little Xbox 360 sprinkled in.&quot;

                              <span>I have said it before, and I will more than likely say it again, but The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild really is the gift that keeps on giving.
Despite being out for several years, the Zelda community is still finding countless weird and wonderful ways to approach the game - the most recent of which being a completion of every shrine within the game without using any of the runes on the Sheikah Slate.
Content creator Limcube took on this challenge as part of an incredible 28-hour stream and used a variety of techniques to get to their final goal of 120/120 shrines completed.

                              <span>A new trio of actors has been announced for Amazon&#x27;s upcoming Fallout TV adaptation - Kyle MacLachlan, Xelia Mendes-Jones and Aaron Moten.
However, at the time of writing, no further details have been given about what role any of the actors will play on the show&#x27;s release (via Variety). 
MacLachlan is probably best known for his role of Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks, as well as Trey MacDougal in Sex and the City and Orson Hodge in Desperate Housewives. For the fellow parents among us, he is also the voice of Riley&#x27;s father in the very good (and more than just a little bit emotional) Inside Out.

                              <span>Quantic Lab, a company which provides quality assurance (QA) support, has responded to a claim it misled Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red over its work on the game.


The allegation surfaced this week via a YouTube video from a channel named Upper Echelon Gamers. Titled &quot;What Made Cyberpunk 2077 Fail - Quantic Lab?&quot;, the 14-minute video claimed the QA studio had placed junior members of its team on the project instead of seasoned veterans, and flagged too many minor bugs. 


These issues, the video claimed, impacted Quantic Lab&#x27;s work and therefore the overall game.

&quot;Breakers, after more than four years of elemental magic and spell combinations, we&#x27;ve made the decision to end development of Spellbreak,&quot; Proletariat wrote. &quot;Thank you to the millions of players who have joined us in the Hollow Lands since 2018; it&#x27;s been an amazing journey.&quot;

This is the second time the switch has now occured, after Pac-Mom previously took Ms Pac-Man&#x27;s place in Bandai Namco&#x27;s Arcade Archives: Pac-Land earlier this year.


Again, the reason for the swap seems to be the messy legal issues surrounding ownership of Ms Pac-Man, which are the subject of a 2019 lawsuit.

                              <span>The return of the Monkey Island series with the aptly named Return to Monkey Island was a welcome surprise when it was announced earlier this year (on April Fool&#x27;s Day no less). After all, we had not seen a new game with Guybrush Threepwood at the fore since 2009. 
However, while we are getting a return, this may not be the start of a new wave of games based in the sun-soaked Caribbean islands. Rather, this appears to be the last one of its kind. 
Following its new gameplay trailer yesterday (see above) and the news it will be coming to the Nintendo Switch as a console first, the Return to Monkey Island developers unveiled a new website for the game. It is a great site, with playful interactive options for fans of the series, including the chance to &#x27;chat&#x27; with series regular Stan.

Details dug up from an Xbox store listing point to Skull and Bones having the usual array of pre-order bonuses, as well as premium items for an edition including a soundtrack and artbook.


A release date - 8th November 2022 - was also spied, thanks to regular store watcher Aggiornamenti Lumia, and subsequently verified by serial leaker Tom Henderson.

Revealed during today&#x27;s busy Nintendo Direct, Cyber Space is a mysterious digital realm that can be reached by uncovering ancient entrances around Starfall Islands - a cluster of landmasses incorporating Kronos Island, the lush area seen in Sonic Frontiers&#x27; divisive first trailers.
