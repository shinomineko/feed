&quot;Back in January we announced that four weapons from the Dreaming City and four weapons from the Moon were being reissued with new perk pools but had not brought them all back yet,&quot; the developer explained in its weekly update. &quot;In our next update, currently scheduled for [6th July], we will be reissuing the remaining Moon and Dreaming City weapons with new perks. 
&quot;All of these weapons will drop from their original sources on their respective destination.&quot;

As part of its &quot;one-year anniversary celebration&quot;, the Nintendo Switch-exclusive free-to-play &quot;Ninja-Gum&quot; action game is teaming up with the anime Demon Slater: Kimetsu no Yaiba for a limited-time event running from mid-July until the end of August.
Kicking off on 19th July, the collaboration will reportedly &quot;not only feature Tanjiro and Nezuko, but other members of the Demon Slayer Corps including Zenitsu and Rengoku, and their nemesis Muzan Kibutsuji himself&quot; (thanks, Nintendo Life).

Addressing attendees at the WSE Innovation Day, CDPR CEO Adam Kiciński said the team was &quot;constantly working&quot; on patches to improve performance and stability, adding that further improvements were also being planned.
According to translation courtesy of Google Translate, Kiciński told TVN24: &quot;We have already achieved a satisfactory level in this regard [of stability]. We have also been working on the overall efficiency, which we are also quite happy about. Of course, we also removed bugs and glitches, and we will continue to do that.&quot;

                    <span>Blizzard has confirmed that while Overwatch 2 is definitely still slated to come to Nintendo Switch, the game will have &quot;some compromises&quot; on Nintendo&#x27;s handheld system.
In an AMA on Reddit, spotted by TheGamer, the team dutifully answered a bunch of questions about the sequel, including one from a fan self-described as a &quot;solely Switch player&quot; who asked how the improved graphics and performance seen in recent reveals will translate to Nintendo&#x27;s hardware.
The reply came from technical director, John Lafleur.

                    <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla game director, Eric Baptizat, has left Ubisoft to join EA Motive.
The seasoned director - who helped reboot the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series as lead designer on Origins and director on Valhalla - had been with the French developer/publisher for 16 years, but left earlier this year to join Motive on an unannounced project. 
Axios says &quot;neither EA nor Baptizat are commenting on the move&quot; (thanks, VGC), but we&#x27;ve reached out and will confirm as/when we hear back from either party.

                    <span>A rating for the unannounced Castlevania Advance Collection has popped up again - this time in Korea.
It solidifies a leak that came to light last week, when the same title similarly popped up in Australia.
This time, H2 Interactive Co. Ltd submitted the game to the panel - in Australia, it was publisher and IP holder Konami itself - which has been awarded an ages 12 and up rating (thanks, VG24/7).

It&#x27;s not the first time players have been able to double up as their favourite Avengers - it was first introduced via time-limited mode, The Tachyon Anomaly - but the feature proved so popular amongst the community that developer Crystal Dynamics is now introducing it permanently in a big update slated to come next month. 
&quot;Due to your feedback, we&#x27;re permanently turning on the ability to play multiple of the same Hero during matchmaking and when forming Strike Teams,&quot; the development team confirmed in a blog post, (thanks, TheGamer).

According to Steam&#x27;s official stats, the multiplayer FPS hit a peak of 151,253 concurrent players on Steam on Friday night.
The previous high was 147,360 concurrent players in December. At the time of this article&#x27;s publication, Team Fortress 2 had 141,741 concurrent players on Steam.

                    <span>Modders do incredible things with the video games we love. They build expansion-sized add-ons, issue performance fixes, and come up with the weird and wonderful to extend the life of games long since left behind by their original creators.
And then there&#x27;s this, a Greggs in Far Cry 5.
Edinburgh-based artist Mojo Swoptops recreated our nation&#x27;s sandwich shop in fine detail. It&#x27;s got a Greggs-looking counter flanked not by fridges stuffed with sparsely-filled sandwiches but shelving units packed with fruit. The Greggs sign is pretty close, though.

                    <span>Mass Effect Legendary Edition has certainly done the trick: it&#x27;s rekindled a love of BioWare&#x27;s original trilogy years after the games came out. But it&#x27;s not just Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 that are being judged once again. Fans are reappraising Mass Effect Andromeda, too.
2017&#x27;s Mass Effect Andromeda endured a torrid time upon release, with clips of dialogue scenes descending into meme status. There were other areas of the game that came under fire, including its limited character creator, bugs and animation quirks.
Beyond that, though, Andromeda&#x27;s missions, storyline and characters failed to set the world on fire. Without Commander Shepard, the Normandy and the original trilogy&#x27;s cast of much-loved characters, Andromeda set out for a new galaxy, a new premise and new party members. I think it&#x27;s fair to say it didn&#x27;t stick the landing. Some thought the game was just okay, others considered it outright awful. Either way, Andromeda flopped and BioWare soon moved on, leaving it sequel-less.

                    <span>The Halo TV show will reportedly lose its showrunner after season one is over.
Variety reports lead showrunner Steven Kane will not return, should the show get picked up for a second season. Variety suggests a second season &quot;seems likely... given the high-profile nature of the underlying IP and the high level of investment on ViacomCBS&#x27; part&quot;.
Kane has been in Budapest, where production of the Halo TV show is ongoing, for the past two years and wants to return to the states for &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

                    <span>Friday the 13th: The Game was set for an Among Us-style mode before a lawsuit blocked development.
That&#x27;s according to Wes Keltner, CEO of Gun Media and one of the developers of Friday the 13th.
In a TwitLonger post, Keltner revealed a raft of content planned for the game before development was shut down in 2018 because of a messy Hollywood battle over ownership of the franchise.

                    <span>There was once a Mass Effect movie in the works. In 2010 EA sold off the film rights to Legendary Pictures, with then BioWare bosses Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk set to work as executive producers alongside former Mass Effect chief Casey Hudson. But it failed to materialise. Why?
In a recent interview with Business Insider, BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained what happened.
&quot;It felt like we were always fighting the IP,&quot; he said. &quot;What story are we going to tell in 90 to 120 minutes? Are we going to do it justice?&quot;

                    <span>Activision has defeated WWE wrestler Booker T in a Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 likeness lawsuit.
Booker T. Huffman claimed unlicensed use of his character &#x27;G.I. Bro&#x27; with the character &#x27;Prophet&#x27; from Treyarch&#x27;s Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in a lawsuit filed in February 2019.
The lawsuit revolved around a poster Booker T commissioned and used to promote his 2015 comic, G.I. Bro and the Dragon of Death. The comic stars a &quot;special operations hero called G.I. Bro&quot;. Prophet, from 2018&#x27;s Black Ops 4, is a &quot;cybernetically enhanced soldier&quot;. The image below compares the two characters:

                    <span>A fan has made a video imagining a battle royale with cartoon characters set in Apex Legends maps.
Redditor Elpinko made this video after first creating a test version using just Family Guy characters. &quot;I can say that I have spent the last three days perfecting and tweaking but honestly I got carried away,&quot; he said. 
The video was made by putting together different clips from the famous TV shows, using exclusively cartoon characters, to create a battle royale match. Elpinko took action scenes out of the shows and paired them against each other with Apex maps as the setting.

                    <span>Good news everyone, Konami&#x27;s working on a brand new game - other than New Football Game Online Performance Test - and this one certainly looks intriguing. It&#x27;s a &quot;mystery simulation game&quot; called Crimesight, where players must deduce &quot;not only the culprit, but the victim as well&quot;. What, were you expecting Silent Hill? 
The social deduction game is set in a futuristic version of London where crimes can be predicted using an &quot;analytical programme developed using data harvested online&quot;. This has led to reduced crime rates across the world, but the system predicts a crime that could &quot;plunge the world into chaos&quot;, prompting the system&#x27;s architects to create an AI called Sherlock to investigate and prevent this crime.
Sherlock must prevent the criminal mastermind AI (named Moriarty, of course) from committing simulated murder, while Moriarty will try to predict the perfect moment to murder an NPC avatar. The trailer explains that Crimesight allows for 2-4 person multiplayer, and that the game takes place on what looks like a virtual tabletop board.

                    <span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a next-gen exclusive game - it&#x27;s due out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and Stadia at some point in 2022 (assuming it doesn&#x27;t get delayed). But what does being next-gen exclusive actually mean?
In the video below, developer Massive Entertainment discusses how the team has improved its Snowdrop game engine - the one it used to build The Division - to make use of the more powerful hardware.
There&#x27;s a lot of talk about ray tracing and object detail, which is great. And Avatar does look like quite the tech powerhouse - a game that will actually push those next-gen consoles. But my ears were pricked by something Alice Rendell, lead narrative realisation designer, mentioned too: Massive has created a system where NPCs understand the state of the world. For example, they&#x27;re aware of the weather, player progression and time of day. That sounds pretty cool, and I&#x27;m already imagining NPCs complaining about the rain. It rains on Pandora, right?

                    <span>Microsoft unveiled Windows 11 last night, and in doing so mentioned new gaming-focused features.
Windows 11 automatically adds high dynamic range (HDR) enhancements to games built on DirectX 11 or higher that previously only used standard dynamic range (SDR). HDR allows a supported game to render a much wider range of brightness values and colours. It&#x27;s a tech already in the Xbox Series X and S. Microsoft mentioned over 1000 games will support auto HDR, including Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, Rocket League, DayZ, and even Doom 64.
Microsoft said Windows 11 will load new games faster via tech called DirectStorage. Again, this was a part of Xbox Series X and S tech. DirectStorage means games quickly load assets to the graphics card without bogging down the CPU. Microsoft  said to expect incredibly detailed game worlds rendered at &quot;lightning speeds&quot; and without long load times. &quot;DirectStorage Optimised&quot; Windows 11 PCs are configured with the hardware and drivers needed to enable this.

                    <span>A new Grand Theft Auto 5 mod makes Rockstar&#x27;s epic look super realistic.
Modding showcase and tutorials YouTube channel Digital Dreams has given GTA fans a potential glimpse into the official next-gen upgrade that&#x27;s coming out later this year with the video below.
The video showcases GTA 5 running in 8k on an Nvidia RTX 3090. Various mods have been applied, such as QuantV, which updates the games graphics and GTA 5 Real Life Pack.

                    <span>Insomniac Games has largely focused on single-player titles over the last few years, producing big hits Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man for the PlayStation. But it seems the studio has plans to work on a multiplayer project - although exactly what this could be is anyone&#x27;s guess. 
A job advert posted by Insomniac on Twitter mentions the developer has &quot;five new job openings for a multiplayer project&quot;. Insomniac is looking for a creative director, systems designer, story lead, art director and VFX artist. 
That doesn&#x27;t give much away, but the systems designer job description does mention having a &quot;thorough understanding of melee combat systems, enemy design and boss design&quot; would be useful experience. The designer would help develop &quot;combat, navigation, progression, and economy&quot; for a multiplayer environment. Make of that what you will.

                    <span>343 has gone into detail on Halo Infinite&#x27;s seasons, insisting they should be manageable from a player perspective.
In a post on Halo Waypoint, live team design director Ryan Paradis and lead progression designer Christopher Blohm discussed 343&#x27;s seasons and battle pass philosophy.
Infinite&#x27;s seasons will each last three months, which, according to Paradis, &quot;gives players a good amount of time to experience and explore the seasonal content, without it getting tiresome and without constantly pulling the rug from under players.&quot;

                    <span>Ubisoft has pulled GoldenEye levels a fan made in Far Cry 5 after a copyright infringement complaint.
YouTuber Krollywood spent two-and-a-half years recreating Rare&#x27;s seminal N64 first-person shooter inside the level editor provided within Far Cry 5, but this week Ubisoft removed the levels from the game&#x27;s arcade mode after a copyright infringement claim reportedly issued by MGM.
All 18 GoldenEye campaign levels were remade and made available to play by anyone in Far Cry 5&#x27;s arcade mode, even with the odd additional Easter egg. You can check out the Dam remake level in the video below:

According to the Global Times report, the system had shot down several PLA pilots during a handful of virtual exercises in recent years.

                    <span>It&#x27;s very much a case of &#x27;gotta go faster&#x27; this week on the Epic Games Store, where Sega&#x27;s masterful retro platformer reimagining Sonic Mania and the excellent old-school arcade racer Horizon Chase Turbo are both currently free.
2017&#x27;s Sonic Mania, if it somehow managed to pass you by, sees developer Christian Whitehead and team serving up a sumptuous smorgasbord of classic side-scrolling platforming, meticulously designed to evoke the breathless left-right thrills of Sonic&#x27;s 16-bit heyday. 
Brand-new stages sit alongside beloved classics taken from Sonic 1 through Sonic &amp; Knuckles - all thoroughly, expertly remixed to form playful new challenges - and the package is topped off with vibrant visuals and a flawless soundtrack, both managing to perfectly capture the spirit of Sonic&#x27;s original Mega Drive adventures.

                    <span>Following various not-so-subtle teases from the Apex Legends Twitter account, Respawn has announced that the original Kings Canyon map is returning in an upcoming Collection Event. Oh, and everyone&#x27;s favourite murder site, Skull Town, is being introduced as an Arenas map. 
The Genesis Collection Event kicks off on 29th June and lasts until 13th July, offering a bunch of new paid cosmetics (and what looks like an extremely cool Revenant scythe heirloom). As usual, you can acquire these by purchasing event packs or buying them directly with Apex Coins or Crafting Materials. You&#x27;ll need to purchase all 24 items to unlock the Revenant heirloom - paying for all of that would certainly be the death of me. 
There are some freebies, however: players will be able to earn 1600 points per day in daily challenges as part of the event&#x27;s rewards track. This includes legendary Charge Rifle and EVA-8 skins, along with a variety of charms. On top of this, there are some stretch challenges with special event badges as rewards.

                    <span>Cowering in terror used to be one of my absolute favourite strategies during my early Valheim days, but from now on it seems that will be a less viable tactic. Developer Iron Gate is introducing some enemy AI tweaks to make monsters more aggressive, which should encourage them to start barging into your base. How rude.
The latest Valheim patch notes explain that the new update will fix several AI issues, with monsters made &quot;slightly more aggressive&quot;. They will now &quot;attack your buildings etc. when they are not able to attack you&quot;, meaning you&#x27;ll probably have to be more proactive in taking out enemies before they destroy your beautiful wooden structures. &quot;It&#x27;s fun for the whole family,&quot; Iron Gate said in the patch notes. (Is it, though?)
If you&#x27;re strolling through the Black Forest, you may also want to watch your head, as the Greydwarfs have had their aim improved - meaning they now have half a chance of actually getting a shot on target. A &quot;long forgotten Blob event&quot; has also been enabled, while bosses will no longer run from you. All in all, it sounds like the world of Valheim is getting a little more dangerous.

                    <span>It&#x27;s time for the latest chapter in Valve&#x27;s ongoing battle with Team Fortress 2 bots: this week sees a new update that should, in theory, make bot behaviour slightly less annoying.
As detailed on the Team Fortress 2 updates page, TF2 was patched on Tuesday with a number of measures that should limit what bots get up to when in-game. There&#x27;s now a tool to control how many times players can change their name in a match, for instance, and for public matchmaking it seems this has been set to zero - thus preventing bots from frequently changing their names or mimicking real players. 
The update also introduces a grace period at the start of matches to prevent players immediately calling votes, which should put the brakes on bots that are trying to deliberately clog up the vote-kick system. Similarly, players joining an in-progress game will face a cooldown before they can call a vote. Kick votes will also &quot;end early and automatically pass if the vote target leaves the match during the vote&quot;.

According to The Verge, Microsoft will open up its store to any Windows app, which means apps such as Chrome will be available for the first time.

                    <span>Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy, a role-playing game released back in 2014, was recently included in a list of older games for which Ubisoft had decided to end online support. By doing so, however, Ubisoft also appeared to shut down DRM servers for Might &amp; Magic 10: Legacy - leaving some players unable to access significant portions of the game&#x27;s single-player content and its DLC. And despite these issues, the game and its DLC are still on sale.
The server shutdown began on 1st June, after which players began to report problems accessing DLC areas from the game&#x27;s The Falcon &amp; The Unicorn expansion. Players who owned the DLC also found they were unable to play past Act 1 of the main game with the expansion installed. Some who bought the deluxe version reported they could no longer access the special in-game items included with that version (via PC Gamer). 
Players have been creating their own workarounds for the problems, with some editing NPC dialogue to do so, but so far there hasn&#x27;t been an official fix. Ubisoft told Eurogamer it is &quot;aware and investigating the reported issues with our internal teams&quot;.

The challenges caused and entrenched by surveillance-based advertising include, but are not limited to:
privacy and data protection infringements
opaque business models
manipulation and discrimination at scale
fraud and other criminal activity
serious security risks
In the following chapters, we describe various aspects of these challenges and point out how today’s dominant model of online advertising is a threat to consumers, democratic societies, the media, and even to advertisers themselves. These issues are significant and serious enough that we believe that it is time to ban these detrimental practices...</span>

                    <span>Space Jam - the cult Looney-Tunes-meets-live-action basketball movie from the 90s - is getting the retro-style video game beat-&#x27;em-up treatment for Xbox, PC, and mobile to promote upcoming movie sequel, Space Jam: A New Legacy, and it&#x27;ll be accompanied by a range of new Space-Jam-themed Xbox controllers.
According to a new post on Xbox Wire, Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game, developed by Digital Eclipse, was inspired by a number of fan-submitted idea picked as part of a competition held late last year. That ultimately led to the creation of a 90s-inspired arcade beat-&#x27;em-up in which Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, and LeBron James engage in some basketball-imbued brawling to defeat a virtual army controlled by a nefarious AI.
&quot;Fortunately,&quot; explains Microsoft, &quot;our heroes have access to a variety of moves, including a special basketball, and some rather unique Space Jam cards, to help them out.&quot;

                    <span>The original Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive first launched in Japan on 23rd June 1991 - 30 years ago today.
Sonic himself is actually a couple of years older. Like the Nintendo mascot he was engineered to replicate, Sonic first popped up elsewhere - in 1991 Sega arcade racer Rad Mobile - before getting his own game.
But it&#x27;s that 1991 side-scrolling classic which defined Sonic&#x27;s appeal, as well as the series&#x27; gameplay, design and villain Doctor &quot;Eggman&quot; Robotnik.

Using GameGAN, Kinsley collaborated with developer Daniel Kukieła on this two-month project, which followed a similar idea last year that recreated Pac-Man by watching another AI play through the game.
Neither of the two collaborators came in with much knowledge of GANs, Kinsley told Eurogamer. &quot;It was a lot of trial and error and just small tweaks and seeing if and how they improved. We didn&#x27;t have much knowledge, so we had a lot of learning to do, and still do.&quot;

Now, an update on the game&#x27;s official Twitter account has stated that Blaston &quot;isn&#x27;t the best fit for this type of advertising test&quot;. The trial has now been cancelled.

Newly-filed court documents show The Pokémon Company has now reached a $300k settlement with the pair, who are described as having stolen &quot;trade secrets&quot; by snapping &quot;illicit pictures from an unreleased strategy guide&quot; (thanks, Polygon). 
One of the defendants was discovered to have been employed at LSC Communications, the company which had printed the Pokémon Sword and Shield strategy guide. The other defendant was identified as the individual who had then received photos of the guide via a group chat and posted them onto Discord, making them public.

                    <span>EA has now put a time on EA Play Live, its big upcoming summer announcements show coming a month later than E3.
You&#x27;ll be able to tune in for the pre-show at 6pm UK time (10am Pacific) on 22nd July, EA said. WWE star Austin Creed, AKA Xavier Wood, will host.
How long will the pre-show be? When will the actual show start? EA has not provided either of these details, presumably in a bid to hook you in earlier and have you watching the whole thing.

                    <span>Microsoft&#x27;s special Cyberpunk 2077 refund policy ends 6th July, it&#x27;s announced.

In a note on the Microsoft Store, Microsoft said updates to the game had caused the change.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re playing Call of Duty: Warzone, you probably have an opinion on Dead Silence.
The popular field upgrade does exactly what it says on the tin: it temporarily makes your footsteps silent. But there&#x27;s more: it also makes your movement slightly faster.

                    <span>A new Grand Theft Auto 5 mod lets players transform into Godzilla and rampage across San Andreas.
Eight years on from its release the action-adventure game developed by Rockstar Games is still extremely popular, especially because of the constant remastering of GTA 5.
JulioNIB, a notorious modder who has created many popular mods in the past is in the process of making the Ultimate Godzilla mod.

                    <span>Lego has at last detailed its full wave of upcoming Super Mario expansion sets due to go sale from 1st August, including a first look at Bee and Frog Mario power-up packs. 
The star of this wave, the Luigi Starter Course, had been officially announced already (after its creepy tease which cause Mario Starter Course figurines to begin crying out).
We&#x27;ve also had a look at the hulking Bowser&#x27;s Airship expansion already - that leaked last week - and the next wave of 10 blind bag figurines available in the Series 3 Character Packs.

                    <span>Chinese conglomerate Tencent now holds a majority stake in Yager, the Berlin-based developer behind cult favourite 2012 shooter Spec Ops: The Line.
Tencent first acquired a small stake in the company back in February 2020. At the time, Yager said it would put the funds towards its free-to-play multiplayer game The Cycle, and then unnamed future projects.
Today&#x27;s news was revealed in an interview with Yager boss Timo Ullmann by German site gameswirtschaft.de, and picked up by Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad. In it, Ullmann says the move comes ahead of a relaunch for The Cycle based on early access feedback.

If this sounds familiar, that&#x27;s because Blue Box said as much back in April. And again last week on Twitter. And now again today.

                    <span>It looks like Call of Duty: Warzone&#x27;s controversial Roze skin is finally, properly nerfed.
Developer Raven made a change to the skin for the start of Season 4, and it has brightened up what was a very dark outfit for operator Roze.
Activision&#x27;s battle royale has for months come under fire for a particular skin for Roze, which many considered &quot;pay-to-win&quot;.

                    <span>Since the start of its new season, Fortnite&#x27;s island has lain in the shadow of a giant UFO mothership. Today, you can beam aboard and explore.
Get beamed up and you&#x27;ll find yourself in a mini dungeon filled with locations from the past to hop around in low-gravity. (I am delighted to see the return of the much-missed Butter Barn, home of Fortnite&#x27;s brilliant pancake song.)
With 90 seconds on the clock, the aim of the game is to collect alien orbs which boost the amount of loot you&#x27;ll get upon leaving. You can also extend your time in the mothership by picking up timer orbs.

                    <span>A Final Fantasy 9 animated kids series is in the works.
Kidscreen reports Paris-based Cyber Group Studios has done a deal with Square Enix to adapt the 21-year-old role-playing game into an animated series aimed at eight to 13-year-olds.
It&#x27;s early days, though. Cyber Group Studios plans to pitch the project to broadcasters in the coming months, with production set to begin by the end of 2021 or beginning of 2022. Episode count and length have yet to be decided.

                    <span>After more than a year of gameplay bonuses designed to make Pokémon Go easier to play during the pandemic, developer Niantic has laid out a detailed roadmap for how it will remove, replace and adopt these changes in the future.
Some changes will be made permanent, though others - most notably the ability to interact with PokéStops and gyms at an increased distance - will be removed. 
But changes will be made on a country-by-country basis, Niantic has said, and in the short term there will be new temporary &quot;exploration bonuses&quot; for countries which lose the pandemic changes soon.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard shareholders have voted to approve boss Bobby Kotick&#x27;s $155m pay packet after a controversial delay.
GamesIndustry.biz reports the say-on-pay vote, which had been delayed to this week in what was seen by some as an effort by Activision Blizzard to avoid an embarrassing slapdown, won approval from 54 percent of shareholders - down from the 56.8 percent approval seen last year, which itself was down from the 58 percent approval of 2019.
The decision comes following significant pressure from CtW, an investment company that &quot;holds directors accountable for irresponsible and unethical corporate behaviour and excessive executive pay&quot;.

                    <span>At this year’s Apple Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple announced something called “iCloud Private Relay.” That’s basically its private version of onion routing, which is what Tor does.
Privacy Relay is built into both the forthcoming iOS and MacOS versions, but it will only work if you’re an iCloud Plus subscriber and you have it enabled from within your iCloud settings.
Once it’s enabled and you open Safari to browse, Private Relay splits up two pieces of information that — when delivered to websites together as normal — could quickly identify you. Those are your IP address (who and exactly where you are) and your DNS request (the address of the website you want, in numeric form)...</span>

Operators are proving to be an excellent solution to
running stateful distributed applications in Kubernetes. Open source tools like
the Operator SDK provide ways to build reliable and maintainable
operators, making it easier to extend Kubernetes and implement custom
scheduling.
Kubernetes operators run complex software inside your cluster. The open source
community has already built many operators for distributed
applications like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, or Argo CD. Even outside of
open source, operators can help to bring new functionality to your Kubernetes
cluster.
An operator is a set of custom resources and a
set of controllers. A controller watches for changes to specific
resources in the Kubernetes API and reacts by creating, updating, or deleting

                    <span>Kim Swift, lead designer on Portal, has joined Xbox Game Studios to work on its publishing programme. 
Xbox announced the hire today via a Twitter post which mentioned Swift&#x27;s role would be to &quot;accelerate our innovation and collaborate with independent studios to build games for the cloud&quot;. 
Swift is most famous for her stint at Valve, which began when her portal-based game demo Narbacular Drop impressed Valve bosses and she was roped on board.

                    <span>Nefarious fans selling codes for an upcoming Destiny 2 player emblem have been called out by Bungie.
The in-game emblem, themed after the beloved Spicy Ramen Coupon item, was planned as a surprise free gift in July, Bungie community manager dmg04 was forced to reveal.
The emblem was discovered by dataminers peering within Destiny 2&#x27;s API. Some fans then began to charge for early access to it.

                    <span>Tekken X Street Fighter was &quot;about 30 percent done&quot; when it was cancelled.
Speaking on his YouTube series Harada&#x27;s Bar, Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada discussed the ill-fated project, which was announced 11 years ago in July 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Tekken X Street Fighter was a much-hyped crossover fighting game in development at Bandai Namco in collaboration with Street Fighter maker Capcom. It was meant to follow 2D fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken by mashing together characters from both series, this time in the 3D Tekken style.

Redditor Rxelik discovered a plain-looking door found in a warehouse in Salt Mines instantly downs with just a touch, and uploaded the footage to r/warzone.
It&#x27;s not an issue isolated to Rxelik, either. This door has downed a few players since Season 4 went live last week.

                    <span>After being interrupted during mining in the Black Forest for the thousandth time, you could be forgiven for wanting to beat up a Greydwarf with your bare hands - and thanks to the work of Valheim&#x27;s modding community, you now can. Well, while holding VR controllers, I guess. 
VHVR is a community-made VR mod for Valheim that was first released back in April, and did a pretty good job of translating Valehim&#x27;s Viking world into VR (even if players could only move using a standard gamepad or mouse and keyboard). Here&#x27;s our own Ian Higton trying it out at the time:
Work on the mod continued post-launch, and now VHVR has been given a game-changing update that adds motion control support. Thanks to the work of modder Maddy25 (who apparently almost single-handedly implemented many of the motion control systems), you can now interact with items in Valheim more directly. There&#x27;s upper-body and finger tracking using VRIK, melee combat, bow and arrow controls, fishing, point and click building, and you can use your hands to interact with the environment. There are also custom VR controls for interacting with menus, along with switching and equipping items.

It&#x27;s the first time the game has reserved a costumed Pokémon specifically for a certain region - and a small one, at that. 
Immediately, the announcement raised eyebrows among fans wanting to catch &#x27;em all - but unable to do so due to ongoing international travel restrictions.

That&#x27;s according to a comment made by GamesBeat&#x27;s ever-chatty Jeff Grubb, which was picked up by VGC, and which tallies with information we&#x27;ve also heard.
According to Grubb, EA plans to announce the project at its upcoming EA Play event in just a few weeks&#x27; time. So, act surprised.

                    <span>The Center for Security and Emerging Technology has a new report: “Machine Learning and Cybersecurity: Hype and Reality.” Here’s the bottom line:
The report offers four conclusions:
Machine learning can help defenders more accurately detect and triage potential attacks. However, in many cases these technologies are elaborations on long-standing methods — not fundamentally new approaches — that bring new attack surfaces of their own.
A wide range of specific tasks could be fully or partially automated with the use of machine learning, including some forms of vulnerability discovery, deception, and attack disruption. But many of the most transformative of these possibilities still require significant machine learning breakthroughs.

                    <span>Square Enix says it is &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; by the success of its new IP, Outriders, stating &quot;the digital sales ratio for the title have been very high&quot; and insisting that its &quot;decision to make Outriders available with Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass as soon as the title launched also worked in [its] favour&quot;.
Xbox teased the shooter was coming to Xbox Game Pass just a couple of weeks before release, and swiftly became one of the service&#x27;s most high-profile Game Pass offerings. Now, a few months on, Square Enix says that despite the &quot;slight issues&quot; with bugs and server instability, it has &quot;gotten off to a good start as a new IP&quot;.
&quot;In regards to the response to Outriders, while there were slight issues with bugs and the like on launch, we believe it has gotten off to a good start as a new IP,&quot; Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda told investors at a financial briefing back in May, the English translation of which was published today (thanks, VGC).

                    <span>Following the release of a new video teaser showcasing what&#x27;s new in the upcoming TAEGO update for PUBG, fans think they&#x27;ve discovered new features coming the original battle royale game, including new weapons, vehicles, a new zone feature, and even self pick-up.
According to an analysis by dataminer PlayerIGN (thanks, PCGN), as well as self-pickup, TAEGO&#x27;s new 8x8 map will also feature a new Pony Coupe vehicle, 5.56 K2 Assault Rifle, 5.56 K12 DMR, a &quot;new airdrop type&quot;, a possible new Zone feature, and the return of Paramo&#x27;s Chinook helicopter.
A second teaser and screenshots released in Korea also suggest we&#x27;ll see a palace and a school on the new map, with rumours the new content will be available to play on the PC Test Server from 30th June.

In an interview with GameSpot, Bihlfroff said they could &quot;definitely confirm [Bayonetta 3] still exists&quot;.
&quot;I will even go one further and say that not only does it exist, but it&#x27;s progressing well,&quot; Trinen clarified.

According to a tweet posted by a senior producer from Double Fine over the weekend, the &quot;amazing&quot; team has created &quot;something so special&quot; and has managed to do so without crunch, the industry term given to intense and often mandatory overtime that many studios require in order to get games completed in time to meet their release dates.
&quot;Fun fact: Psychonauts 2 has had no crunch,&quot; announced Double Fine&#x27;s Kevin Johnson on Twitter (thanks, TheGamer).

Polfeldt, who was heading the Ubisoft team responsible for the upcoming Avatar game as well as leading on titles like The Division, is taking &quot;a long break&quot; before &quot;embark[ing] on a new adventure in Ubisoft&quot;. Polfeldt has worked at Massive for 17 years, and served as managing director for 12 of those.
&quot;When we signed Star Wars, and finally completed our beautiful building Eden in 2020, I felt an overwhelming sense of completion, as if I had achieved everything I once dreamt of,&quot; the director said on the Ubisoft blog (thanks, VGC).

                    <span>The team behind Among Us, Innersloth, has opened up about feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; and &quot;burnt out&quot; after the success of their cult classic multiplayer detective game during lockdown.
&quot;Among Us going viral, it was just like, &#x27;OK, this is my life,&#x27;&quot; said artist Amy Liu. &quot;The pressure to get things done quickly was really high. September to December, we&#x27;re talking to Xbox, PlayStation. They were gonna try to get Among Us on these platforms, which usually takes many months - like, half a year to a year. We were like, &#x27;Three months! We&#x27;re gonna try that.&#x27;&quot;
&quot;I definitely burnt out,&quot; Liu told Anthony Padilla (thanks, Kotaku). &quot;It was tough because during all of this, we weren&#x27;t able to see friends and family. Being so tired from working, I couldn&#x27;t even go visit my family during covid and had to spend holidays alone... that was definitely the hardest time.&quot;

The headline additions are an increased level cap from 50 to 100 and the much-requested scrap action to the loot screen, which should reduce time spent cleaning up the inventory.

                    <span>Steam hit Phasmophobia is, remarkably, developed by just one person. But the game has become such a big deal that help is finally on the way.
The co-op ghost-hunting game is created by 25-year-old UK indie developer &#x27;Dknighter&#x27;, who took to Phasmophobia&#x27;s Steam page to announce the expansion of studio Kinetic Games.
&quot;Over the past few years I have been developing Phasmophobia on my own however due to how much it has grown in both popularity and its future content plans it is now time to expand the team,&quot; Dknighter said.

                    <span>EA has increased the Battlefield 4 server capacity after a player spike following the Battlefield 2042 reveal.
In a post on EA&#x27;s website, community manager &#x27;Straatford&#x27; said the company had noticed queue times in the US West region for the 2013 DICE-developed shooter were far longer than in other regions. In response, EA increased server capacity in this region, so players should expect less waiting to get into a game.
&quot;We were absolutely blown away by your excitement and reactions to the recent Battlefield 2042 reveal,&quot; Straatford said.

                    <span>Outriders&#x27; next patch tackles one of the biggest issues with the game: the dreaded grind for legendaries.
In a post on reddit, Outriders&#x27; community manager from publisher Square Enix &#x27;thearcan&#x27; outlined a raft of changes coming to the looter shooter in a patch set for early next week.
Chief among them is a significant change to legendary drops. Legendary drop rates, across the board, will increase by 100 percent with this update.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone got a new LMG this week - and already its developer has promised a nerf.
The MG 82, added to the game as a tier 15 unlock from the Season 4 battle pass on Thursday, was soon found to shred enemies extremely quickly - at a time when developer Raven wants to increase Warzone&#x27;s &#x27;time-to-kill&#x27;.
One of the other issues with the gun is it is available out in the field as ground loot. This means players have early access to an extremely strong gun, simply from looting. Sometimes you&#x27;ll pick up the MG 82 with decent attachments, too.

                    <span>Pottering around a Viking-era version of your home in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is an enormous amount of fun - as I discovered from my adventures in Gloucestershire - but could it also encourage others to visit your country? That&#x27;s what Tourism Ireland is banking on, as the organisation has teamed up with Ubisoft to use Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla in a promotional campaign. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s first expansion, Wrath of the Druids, brings Viking protagonist Eivor across the seas to embark on new adventures in Ireland. Locations such as Dublin, Benbulben, the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and the Hill of Tara are all visitable in-game, and Tourism Ireland has collaborated with Ubisoft to create a comparison video showing the game versions and their real-life counterparts: 
The campaign doesn&#x27;t end there, however, as streamers in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Scandinavia will help showcase Irish landscapes in Wrath of the Druids as part of the collaboration. This is the first time that Tourism Ireland has worked with gaming content creators.

These Ultimate Team Preview Packs, as EA calls them, let you see all the specific items contained within them before you make a decision on whether to buy with FUT Coins or FIFA Points.
FUT Coins is a virtual currency earned through gameplay. FIFA Points is a virtual currency bought with real-world money.

It looks like both games&#x27; entry on the database is via codenames (HeronStaging for Alan Wake Remastered, and Pineapple for Final Fantasy 7 Remake), but you can see the real game names in the cloud save folder.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s big Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla update added a new mode to the game, Mastery Challenge, which offers a series of repeatable maps to stomp and stealth your way through in return for fresh rewards. 
We knew the gist of all this already - and we&#x27;ll go into more detail below - but what has come as a nice surprise is the new narrative this mode folds into the game, including a tease for something else being added to Valhalla down the line. 
The Mastery Challenge questline begins with a bang, as a meteor hits Eivor&#x27;s Ravensthorpe. The impact reveals a door, apparently concealed within the cliffside all this time, and a mysterious woman, Hildiran, who&#x27;s now investigating what&#x27;s going on.

                    <span>What if you were a tiny little semi-sentient program running through a mainframe? Well, that&#x27;s basically what&#x27;s going on in Recompile - a Metroidvania-inspired 3D platformer that&#x27;s due to release later this year. 
Recompile was originally planned for release in 2020, but as announced during Gamespot&#x27;s Play for All showcase, it&#x27;s now set to launch this August. Players take on the role of a computer virus that&#x27;s trying to escape deletion. It&#x27;s got snappy combat, generous amounts of mobility and plenty of hacking-themed puzzles - as I discovered when I tried it out at EGX Rezzed in 2019. 
Oh, also there are some pretty spectacular visual effects going on, as you can see from the latest trailer:

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone on PlayStation 4 received a surprise update this week to enable 120fps on PlayStation 5 via backwards compatibility, but it can be tricky to actually make work.
Fans soon discovered that in order to get 120fps on the battle royale, you have to turn off HDR (high-dynamic-range imaging) on the PS5.
I had a chat with Rich from Digital Foundry and he verified this is the case. Disabling HDR is the only way to get Warzone working at 120fps on PS5.

                    <span>Elden Ring finally stepped out of the shadows with a proper trailer and several chunky interviews during E3 week, but one person we hadn&#x27;t heard from on the subject was, of course, George R.R. Martin. The Game of Thrones author has been involved in some of the writing for Elden Ring, and now we&#x27;ve finally heard a little more about his contributions from the man himself. 
Martin recently visited Northwestern University&#x27;s Medill School of Journalism (where he studied in the &#x27;70s) to receive an honorary doctorate, and during the visit spoke to local news station WWTW about his career... including Elden Ring. He didn&#x27;t exactly provide any shocking revelations, but confirmed he&#x27;d mainly been involved in the early stages of development and creating the game&#x27;s fantasy world. 
&quot;The game is called the Elden Ring and it&#x27;s a sequel to a video game that came out a few years ago called Dark Souls,&quot; Martin said. &quot;My work on it was actually done years ago. These games, they&#x27;re like movies, they take a long time to develop.

                    <span>Some Nintendo Switch owners are still reporting problems when trying to download games and game updates from the eShop, more than a week after the problem first came to light. 
Nintendo customer support is aware of the problem, and there is a page of troubleshooting tips to follow if you encounter the issue&#x27;s error code: 2123-1502.
Fans I&#x27;ve spoken to say customer support is helping as best it can, but that repeating the above &quot;possible solutions&quot; per-download is meant as a temporary solution at present.

                    <span>World of Warcraft Shadowlands&#x27; Chains of Domination update comes out on 29th June, Blizzard has announced.
The update, which brings with it the next chapter in the Shadowlands story, adds a new zone called Korthia. This area, which the Jailer has pulled into the Maw, includes a number of new quests.
There&#x27;s a new mega-dungeon called Tazavesh, The Veiled Market. &quot;Explore the exotic wares, merchants, and creatures of this Broker bazaar, which culminates in a high-stakes heist involving powerful artifacts from Azeroth,&quot; Blizzard said.

Bowser&#x27;s Airship is one of the largest Super Mario sets we&#x27;ve seen so far. Clocking in at over 14 inches, this 1152-piece addition provides one of the best-looking builds of the entire range.
There&#x27;s no official launch date yet, and Amazon&#x27;s product listing page has now been deleted. Still, we&#x27;d expect it to arrive in August alongside the upcoming Super Luigi Starter Kit and the third wave of blind bag add-ons announced officially earlier this week.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 4 launched yesterday, and with it brought a new vehicle - and the return of an old exploit.
Season 4 added a new armored cargo truck to the game - itself a controversial addition due to how strong the vehicle is, particularly in solo battle royale. But it got a lot worse when it soon emerged the truck could be used to turn invisible.
To be fair to developer Raven, it moved quickly to pull the truck from the game, thus eradicating the invisibility glitch.

                    <span>Flight Simulator is primed to make its highly anticipated Xbox Series X/S debut in just over a month, but, before that, there&#x27;s another huge World Update for PC players, arriving today and giving makeovers to the sim&#x27;s rendition of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.
Developer Asobo is promising pilots the chance to explore &quot;vast fjords, riveting urban vistas, domineering peaks, and centuries-old iconic castles&quot; in its new Nordic countries update, which also brings landscape enhancements, improved regional architecture, five new airports, improved data for 100 airports, and over 78 new points of interest.
Once the World Update is downloaded (first update the sim, then grab the World Update from the in-game Marketplace) players will also have the opportunity to tackle five new bush trips - one for each of the new Nordic countries - plus five new landing challenges, focussed on Denmark&#x27;s Bornholm, Iceland&#x27;s Ísafjörður, Sweden&#x27;s Stockholm Arlanda, Norway&#x27;s Svalbard, and Finland&#x27;s Vaasa Airports.

                    <span>Xbox Design Lab was temporarily suspended last October while Microsoft worked on transitioning between console generations, but the custom controller service is back - allowing you to design your own Series X/S controller. 
The relaunch was announced during Xbox&#x27;s E3 follow-up showcase this evening, and the Xbox Design Lab website is now up and running. The customisation program allows you to pick colours for most external parts of the controller, including the &quot;body, back case, D-pad, bumpers, triggers, thumbsticks, ABXY, View, Menu and Share buttons.&quot; The Xbox Wire blog post says there are 18 colours to choose from, including the colours of existing Xbox Series X/S controllers like Shock Blue and Pulse Red.   
If you want to make it extra personal, you can also get your controller engraved with a Gamertag or custom message of up to 16 characters.

                    <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; next major free update is packing in one hell of a crossover, bringing the world of Disney&#x27;s Pirates of the Caribbean into Rare&#x27;s swashbuckling multiplayer adventure. And if the arrival of Captain Jack Sparrow wasn&#x27;t enough to be excited about, it&#x27;s also finally giving the formidable kraken a face - which makes an appearance in a brand-new trailer.
The centrepiece of Sea of Thieves&#x27; Pirates of the Caribbean crossover - officially known as A Pirate&#x27;s Life - takes the form of a brand-new cinematic story campaign. It features five new Tall Tales episodes (the first since March 2020&#x27;s Heart of Flame), charting Jack Sparrow&#x27;s arrival in the Sea of Thieves and the events that ensue.
There are tantalising snatches of those adventures in Rare&#x27;s second crossover trailer below, including the appearance of Davy Jones and his formidable vessel the Flying Dutchman, battles against gargantuan mermaid statues, and even a portable talking skull that should stir fond memories for Monkey Island aficionados.

The other six are the English, Mongols, Chinese, Delhi Sultanate, Abbasid Dynasty and the French.

Asobo&#x27;s medieval horror is getting a makeover for Xbox Series X on 6th July, with 4K resolution, 60 FPS and other visual enhancements. 
As ever, if you play on Xbox Series X you&#x27;ll just get these enhancements on that date with no extra fuss. Microsoft announced the update tonight, during its E3 Xbox Showcase: Extended event.

                    <span>Ninja Theory has released a new video for Xbox exclusive Hellblade 2, and provided an update on its development.
The video, below, does not include any gameplay or any new footage of the game save some hard to make out snippets. It begins instead with a message from Ninja Theory chief Tameem Antoniades, who discusses the work that&#x27;s being done to make Hellblade 2 at the Microsoft-owned studio&#x27;s new digs in Cambridge. The video then goes on to present a rather disturbing montage that sets the scene.
I get the impression Hellblade 2 is still a long way off. In the video, Antoniades says Ninja Theory is currently building &quot;a good chunky slice of the game before we then move into full production to build out the rest&quot;.

                    <span>If you were wondering just how popular PUBG is on mobile, the answer is: very, as 17 million people have now signed up for upcoming mobile title PUBG: New State. 
PUBG: New State was announced back in February and described as the &quot;only mobile successor to the original PC version of PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;. It&#x27;s a futuristic version of PUBG set after the events of the original game, in the year 2051. It&#x27;s supposed to have &quot;ultra-realistic graphics&quot; that will surpass &quot;what was previously possible in mobile gaming graphics&quot;, along with some new game mechanics like dodging, drone calls and support requests. 
Pre-registration was opened up following the game&#x27;s announcement, with players able to register their interest via Google Play and the App Store. And it seems to have received a lot of attention, judging by the numbers announced by PUBG Corp today.

                    <span>Well, another Cyberpunk 2077 patch has arrived, and although this one doesn&#x27;t bring any spectacular gameplay additions it does promise further bug fixes and stability improvements.
Patch 1.23 is now live on all platforms, and sorts out a number of quest-specific bugs and general performance issues. The patch itself is apparently rather chunky, with console users reporting a download size of 30GB (my Steam download was a rather more modest 3.45GB).  
Of note is the paragraph on stability and performance, which says the patch will provide &quot;numerous crash fixes in animations, UI, scene, physics and gameplay systems&quot;. The patch also promises a reduction in the number of crashes through &quot;memory optimisations and memory management improvements in various systems&quot;. There&#x27;s also a vague mention of &quot;various console CPU optimisations&quot;.

                    <span>It sounds like a dystopian nightmare, yet it&#x27;s fast becoming a reality: Facebook has announced it&#x27;s going to start testing in-headset VR adverts. 
Facebook initially started testing adverts on the Oculus mobile app last month, but it&#x27;s now taking things a step further by trialling adverts inside the Oculus Quest VR headset. The adverts are first being tested in a game called Blaston by Resolution Games, and will roll out to a couple of other apps &quot;over the coming weeks&quot;. 
Judging by a gif on the Oculus blog showing an in-headset advert, it looks like players can point at an advert to click on a link or save it for later. There&#x27;s also a drop-down menu to report and hide ads, and an option to tweak user preferences.

Cawthon confirmed his decision in a statement shared to ScottGames.com, accompanied by Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s artwork drawn by an unnamed eight-year-old fan.
There&#x27;s no mention of the controversy in his statement, save for a reference to him receiving support from the LGBTQ community - a nod to the recent criticism faced by him for supporting Republican candidates with broadly anti-LGBTQ stances.

Cross-platform multiplayer applies to ranked match, friend match and multiplayer leaderboards. There is no cross-platform progress or saves, and you can turn cross-platform play off if you wish.

                    <span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 may still be some way off - it&#x27;s now &quot;aiming&quot; for a 2022 launch - but Nintendo has given fans plenty to pick over in its E3 Direct trailer. 
Now the dust has settled, some excellent fan theories have emerged about what&#x27;s going on - especially regarding Link&#x27;s seemingly-corrupted arm. 

In a thread on Twitter about Link&#x27;s appendage, freelance writer and Eurogamer contributor 
Jordan Oloman highlighted how Link appears to lose his arm at the beginning of the trailer, before it appears to be restored with Sheikah technology.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone has become the first PlayStation 4 backwards compatible game to support 120hz on PlayStation 5.
Season 4 launched this morning, and buried within the patch notes is word Warzone now has 120hz support for PS5. This requires HDMI 2.1.
It&#x27;s a surprise but welcome addition, and hopefully heralds similar updates from other PS4 games running in back compat form on PS5.

                    <span>Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming Metroid Dread will be accompanied by a pair of amiibo figurines you can buy in a pack for $30 (here in the UK, retailers are yet to set a price).
Now, we know what these figurines will do when you first scan them into the game.
The pack&#x27;s Samus amiibo will add an extra energy tank to your health, increasing its overall capacity by 100 HP. These permanent power-ups are often hard to find in Metroid games, but you&#x27;ll get one easily here.

                    <span>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a mobile data standard that was widely used in the early 2000s. The first encryption algorithm for that standard was GEA-1, a stream cipher built on three linear-feedback shift registers and a non-linear combining function. Although the algorithm has a 64-bit key, the effective key length is only 40 bits, due to “an exceptional interaction of the deployed LFSRs and the key initialization, which is highly unlikely to occur by chance.”
GEA-1 was designed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute in 1998. ETSI was — and maybe still is — under the auspices of ...</span>

                    <span>While there was plenty to get excited about in Nintendo&#x27;s busy E3 showcase, one notable absence came in the form of No More Heroes 3 - the latest entry in developer Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s cult-classic action-adventure series - which is coming to Switch in just a few short months. However, Nintendo has now made up for that no-show, sharing 20 minutes of new gameplay in a special Nintendo Treehouse livestream.
Announced back in 2019, No More Heroes 3 - which is set nine years after the events of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle and two years after Travis Strikes Again - once again casts players as otaku and sometime-assassin Travis Touchdown. However, while previous games saw Travis murdering his way to the top of the United Assassins Association league, this third series entry ushers in a new threat, with players now charged with eliminating extraterrestrial enemies in order to reach number one in the Galactic Superhero Rankings.
As seen in Nintendo&#x27;s new &quot;early look&quot; at No More Heroes 3, the series&#x27; wonderfully satisfying hack-and-slash action - built around Travis&#x27; lightsaber-like Beam Katana - makes a return, with no obvious surprises where core mechanics are concerned. Players will again need to combine the likes of basic moves, heavy moves, kicks, blocks, and rolls to defeat enemies (motion controls are optional) with the likes of finishers and jackpot bonuses also returning.

                    <span>The long-lived Grand Theft Auto Online will finally shut down its PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 servers on 16th December 2021. 
In a blog post, Rockstar said it had made the decision to shutter the service for last-last-gen consoles as it prepares to launch GTA Online for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S (the game&#x27;s third console generation to date).
Shark Cash Cards will no longer be sold for PS3 and Xbox 360 after 15th September. Grand Theft Auto 5&#x27;s Story Mode will not be impacted.

                    <span>You&#x27;ve thought it, I&#x27;ve thought it, but the question of what London would look like in the Fallout universe has never truly been answered... until now. 
A Fallout mod team is working on a huge project called Fallout: London, which is described as a &quot;DLC-sized mod for Bethesda&#x27;s Fallout 4&quot;. Although the team has been issuing updates on progress for some time, yesterday the group released a full reveal trailer, and the work done so far looks extremely impressive. Many of London&#x27;s most iconic landmarks have been given a Fallout makeover - including Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and even the BT Tower. Oh, and there&#x27;s some extremely hammy commentary over the whole thing. 
There are some really nice touches throughout the trailer: you can spot plenty of London buses, murky tube stations and even a classic London pub. I&#x27;m also a big fan of the Beefeater who&#x27;s embraced a more Raider-inspired look. It feels like there are some nods to Britain&#x27;s involvement in WWI and WWII, with barrage balloons seen in the sky and soldiers camping out in trenches.

                    <span>The Medium launches on PlayStation 5 on 3rd September, developer Bloober Team has announced.
Its release on PS5 was expected after a rating for the game on Sony&#x27;s console was spotted on the The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) website. The new trailer is below:
Bloober Team&#x27;s well-received third-person psychological horror game The Medium launched digitally for Xbox Series X and S and PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store, as well as via Xbox Game Pass, in January.

                    <span>Microsoft has said how it plans to keep Xbox One going next year even as developers make use of more powerful hardware: cloud streaming.
In a post on Xbox Wire, Microsoft said some exclusives set for 2022 require the power of the Xbox Series X and S and so will use Xbox Cloud Gaming to run on the eight-year old Xbox One.
Microsoft confirmed it will use Xbox Cloud Gaming to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, to Xbox One.

                    <span>TorrentFreak surveyed nineteen VPN providers, asking them questions about their privacy practices: what data they keep, how they respond to court order, what country they are incorporated in, and so on.
Most interesting to me is the home countries of these companies. Express VPN is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. NordVPN is incorporated in Panama. There are VPNs from the Seychelles, Malaysia, and Bulgaria. There are VPNs from more traditional companies like the U.S., Switzerland, Canada, and Sweden. Presumably all of those companies follow the laws on their home country...</span>

                    <span>Koei Tecmo is resurrecting its celebrated picture-snapping survival horror series, Project Zero, bringing its most recent instalment - Wii U&#x27;s Maiden of Black Water - to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC later this year.
Released back in 2015, Maiden of Black Water is the fifth main entry in the Project Zero series (known as Fatal Frame in the US) and once again arms players with a magic camera - used to battle spirits by taking their picture, which is considerably more unnerving than it sounds.
Unfortunately, while Project Zero&#x27;s first three entries are brilliant (and genuinely terrifying) survival horror offerings, Maiden of Black Water - set on the fictional Mount Hikami, known for its suicides and ghostly goings-on - is a bit of a dud.

In a post on EA&#x27;s website, DICE discussed the addition of AI soldiers to the series with Battlefield 2042.
Battlefield 2042 supports 128 players on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game support 64 players. As Eurogamer reported last week, Battlefield 2042 does not have a campaign.

                    <span>If you fancy a tour through some of Mario Party&#x27;s back catalogue, well, Mario Party Superstars sounds like just the ticket - and it&#x27;s arriving this October. 
The game was announced as part of today&#x27;s Nintendo E3 Direct, and promises a whirlwind ride through some classic Mario Party games. It&#x27;s somewhere between a new Mario Party title and remake, essentially mixing elements of previous games into a new collection. This includes five classic Mario Party boards from the N64 era, with boards such as Peach&#x27;s Birthday Cake and Space Land making a reappearance. 
Mario Party Superstars also promises a bunch of minigames from the series&#x27; catalogue - 100 in total, in fact - along with the usual mix of zany board events. All the minigames support button controls.

                    <span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 will launch in 2022, Nintendo has confirmed. 
The hugely-anticipated sequel was shown off today at the very end of Nintendo&#x27;s E3 presentation in a new trailer which revealed new powers, new enemies, and new gameplay in the skies of Hyrule.
The ability to visit floating islands is reminiscent of Skyward Sword, the Wii Zelda entry which is getting a re-release this summer. This time, the islands look larger, and Link will be able to glide through the sky between them.

Title Advance Wars 1+2: Re-boot Camp, the surprise bundle features 3D remakes - &quot;reimagined and rebuilt from the ground-up&quot; - of the original Advance Wars and its sequel Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising (which originally released on Gameboy Advance in 2001 and 2003 respectively), which should make long-starved series fans very happy indeed. Although obviously not quite as happy as if it had been a brand-new game.
Advance Wars 1+2: Re-boot Camp is coming to Switch later this year on 3rd December.

                    <span>WarioWare is back, with WarioWare: Get it Together hitting Switch on the 10th of September.
The announcement was part of Nintendo&#x27;s E3 Direct. The gimmick? Get It Together sees players controlling the WarioWare characters inside the mini-games. So we see Wario squeezing toothpaste out of a giant tube and peeling off a facemask and dodging bird poo, for example. Elsewhere, other WarioWare characters have new talents - 9Volt uses a yo-yo to turn the blades of a windmill in one game - and different characters will be able to use their own specific abilities to complete each challenge.
This idea comes into its own in a new two-player mode which sees players competing or collaborating on a single screen. The micro-games shown throughout the reveal were very classical Wario type experiences, with a lovely swipe-file mix of styles and production values. I can&#x27;t wait.

                    <span>Metroid Dread, the sequel to Metroid Fusion, has a long, long history of being vapourware. But now, after almost 20 years, it is real. Really. 
Nintendo has just announced Metroid Dread will launch for Switch on 8th October. A subsequent Nintendo Treehouse presentation confirmed it was being developed by Nintendo and Metroid: Samus Returns studio MercurySteam. 
Footage revealed during today&#x27;s E3 Direct showed Samus being chased by a robot through various side-scrolling 2D environments. (Of course, both Samus and the robot, EMMI, are also being turned into new amiibo.)

                    <span>Kazuya from Tekken is the next Super Smash Bros. Ultimate DLC character, Nintendo has announced.
Revealed during the Nintendo Direct show, Kazuya in Smash has many of the moves Tekken fans are familiar with, including Spinning Demon and Stonehead. He&#x27;s even got his famous 10-hit combo.
The announcement video includes a cutscene showing Kazuya chucking existing Smash characters off a cliff - that&#x27;s a reference to the famous Tekken cutscene in which Kazuya&#x27;s dad, Heihachi, chucks Kazuya off a cliff.

                    <span>Alright, we&#x27;ve already had shows and big game announcements as part of this year&#x27;s all-online E3 week, but how about actually playing some upcoming games? If you&#x27;ve got an Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S, you&#x27;re in luck. 
ID@Xbox&#x27;s Summer Game Fest demo event kicks off today, and we now have the full list of 40 game demos available for players to try. Gorgeous sci-fi adventure Sable is in the mix (which I&#x27;d thoroughly recommend trying out based on my own hands-on time with the game). There&#x27;s also Tunic, a Zelda-like game with a fox as the main protagonist. 
Elsewhere on the list, you can also find Black Book - a dark RPG adventure based on slavic myths in which you play as a young sorceress and fight in card-based battles. Arietta of Spirits is a retro-inspired adventure telling an emotional story of a girl and her family who visit her grandmother&#x27;s cabin for the first time since she passed away. Echo Generation, meanwhile, is a turn-based adventure game with a real Stranger Things vibe to it:

                    <span>Planet Zoo continues its slow and steady march toward cramming in all the animals next week with the advent of its latest DLC, which introduces a range of new Africa-themed wildlife, including the meerkat, southern white rhinoceros, and more.
Arriving next Tuesday, 22nd June, Planet Zoo&#x27;s Africa Pack DLC features a total of five new animals. The meerkat will display &quot;authentic new digging behaviour&quot;, according to developer Frontier, and is joined by the aforementioned southern white rhinoceros, a couple of cuties in the form of the African penguin and fenec fox, plus the sacred scarab beetle - which is sure to delight visitors as its goes about its day rolling up poop.
Alongside its animal additions, the Africa Pack brings a new timed scenario, new enrichments items (such as the disco ball), plus over 180 new scenery pieces inspired by African architecture.

As part of this update, the wonderful endless role-playing game gets a save on the go feature. This lets you save and exit the game in the middle of an expedition, preserving your progress.
Loop Hero&#x27;s expeditions can go on for quite a while, so being able to save on the go is welcome.

It turns out, for $350 (about £250), it probably could.
Peripheral manufacturer Turtle Beach has announced the VelocityOne Flight system: a yoke handle and lever control set meant to work with Microsoft Flight Simulator on either Xbox or PC.

                    <span>100-player WW2 first-person shooter Hell Let Loose hits new-gen consoles this year.
Black Matter&#x27;s shooter launched on Steam as an Early Access title in June 2019 and has enjoyed a positive reception. It leaves Early Access on PC and launches proper there on 27th July. It then comes out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S late 2021.
The console announcement trailer is below:

                    <span>Well, it looks like the front of Xbox game cases are getting a very slight refresh, as box art images spotted on BestBuy appear to show a newly re-designed version of the standard Xbox Series X game case. 
As you can see from these Halo Infinite and Flight Simulator listings, more of the box is taken up with game art rather than additional Xbox logos at the top, and the console banner has become a little shorter and wider. The banner has also changed colour from black to white - as if someone&#x27;s flipped a switch to put it in light mode. 
Social media account Xbox News also managed to spot a version for Forza Horizon 5, which you can see below. It&#x27;s worth noting that the big &quot;optimised for Series X&quot; badge was removed from cases last year following negative feedback from fans.

It&#x27;s down as &quot;coming soon&quot; to PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One. The announcement trailer is below:
Elex 2 is the sequel to post-apocalyptic sci-fi open-world role-playing game Elex, which Piranha Bytes&#x27; released in 2017. &quot;Hokey, uneven and janky, Elex is nonetheless a compelling throwback to a time before open worlds became choose your own to-do lists,&quot; Richie Shoemaker wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Elex review.

That includes shipments of physical copies and downloads, the developer said in a tweet.
Strive got off to a great start on PC, and hit peak Steam concurrents of over 31,000 players, according to SteamDB.

Most recently, and perhaps most relevantly, Stuart created Vikings spin-off Vikings: Valhalla, a spin-off from the popular Norse telly drama which is also Netflix-bound. 
Further back, more years than I care to mention, Stuart also wrote the screenplay for the legendary Die Hard.

Everwild, alongside various other far-off Microsoft exclusives, was absent from this year&#x27;s Bethesda-dominated Xbox E3 showcase. That is because its development has undergone a reboot, and its launch window pushed back, according to a VGC report.
But while we won&#x27;t see Everwild for some time, there&#x27;s reason to be optimistic for the project. Rare veteran Gregg Mayles, who has served at the studio for more than 30 years, was recently brought on as its creative director.

Based on preliminary reports published by the team of experts that New Hampshire engaged to examine an election discrepancy, it appears that a buildup of dust in the read heads of optical-scan voting machines (possibly over several years of use) can cause paper-fold lines in absentee ballots to be interpreted as votes… New Hampshire (and other states) may need to maintain the accuracy of their optical-scan voting machines by paying attention to three issues:...</span>

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 4 kicks off this week, and brings with it new points of interest to the map.
Satellite crash sites will be plainly visible in Verdansk &#x27;84, with the debris and impact on the landscape &quot;significant&quot;, Activision said in a blog post. These sites offer new opportunities for cover, and the satellites themselves can also be secured.
You can interact with the Sat-Links found in these areas to work toward receiving permanent rewards in the Ground Fall event at the beginning of the season. You can also obtain items to use during the match, such as killstreaks, vehicles, and field upgrades.

                    <span>As part of its E3 2021 livestream, Capcom has offered up a sprinkling of new Monster Hunter news, including confirmation that Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s first collaboration event will arrive this Friday, and that there&#x27;s a Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin demo coming next week.
Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, the latest entry in Capcom&#x27;s RPG spin-off series, comes to Switch and PC on 9th July, but interested parties will be able to download a trial version of the game next Friday, 25th June. Capcom notes all progress made in the demo will be transferable to the main game on release.
Additionally, Capcom confirmed it&#x27;ll be supporting Monster Hunter Stories 2 after launch with free title updates, the first of which will see Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Palamute join the game as a rideable Monstie on 9th July. And if you still haven&#x27;t had your fill of Monster Hunter Stories 2 trailers, here&#x27;s another one now.

Additionally, Resident Evil RE:Verse, the delayed free multiplayer component for Village owners, will finally arrive in July. This lets you play as various Resident Evil characters from throughout the series, though its earlier beta recieved a mixed reception.

                    <span>It looks like Sega might not be quite done with its spherically ensconced simians just yet; images have surfaced for a new entry in the long-running Super Monkey Ball series, this one titled Banana Mania, supposedly heading to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Series X/S.
The images in question, shared by freelance journalist Nils Ahrensmeier on Twitter earlier today, purportedly show PlayStation 5 and Switch box art for Banana Mania, alongside four typically cheery screenshots from the game.
One of these shots teases a return for Monkey Ball&#x27;s much-loved party game Monkey Target, while the others are a little harder to pin down. However, a few well-versed Monkey Ball fans are currently doing some deductive work and speculating that the images could well be pointing to a remake of 2005&#x27;s Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, which melded the first two Monkey Ball games along with brand-new content.

                    <span>Developer Okomotive has revealed Far: Changing Tides, the follow-up to its acclaimed post-apocalyptic vehicle adventure Far: Lone Sails, which is out on PC and consoles later this year.
Changing Tides sends players on a fresh bout of genteel side-scrolling vehicular management. This time, however, instead of embarking on a tank-y trundle across a dried-out ocean, they&#x27;ll be following the horizon for some boat-based adventure above and beneath the waves.
&quot;Set sail and discover the wonders of a flooded world filled with mystery,&quot; explains Okomotive. &quot;Traverse the ruins of a once great society and use the pieces from its past to build a brighter future. Dive into unknown depths on the hunt for precious fuel and salvage, devise innovative solutions to overcome intricate obstacles, and unearth forgotten relics lost to time.&quot;

                    <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s release date reveal for Flight Simulator on Xbox Series X/S, Microsoft has shared a few additional details - including confirmation that it&#x27;ll run at 30fps on console - via the time-honoured mediums of FAQ and Twitter.
Those frame rate details come via the official Microsoft Flight Simulator Twitter feed, which, in response to queries from a number of curious punters, confirmed that Xbox Series X/S players can expect a base frame rate of 30fps. It noted, however, that frame rates above 30fps are possible on TVs supporting variable refresh rates (VRR).
Over on the official Flight Simulator&#x27;s FAQ, meanwhile, most additional details provided aim to clarify questions around how the console edition will interact with the version already released on PC, and confirm, for instance, that those who own the Windows Store version on PC won&#x27;t need to purchase the console edition again.

                    <span>At long last, we finally got a proper look at Elden Ring during Summer Games Fest last week, and all of a sudden we now have a flood of information about what to expect in the upcoming game. In an interview with IGN, legendary director Hidetaka Miyazaki gave plenty of information on the background lore, along with some discussion of abilities, multiplayer and the game&#x27;s structure.
One of the first topics discussed was Elden Ring&#x27;s setting, The Lands Between, which has been deliberately designed to give &quot;an enormous sense of scale and this broadness and openness&quot;. It&#x27;s split into six major areas, each of which is the domain of a demigod. These are lined up to suggest a specific order in which to tackle them, but the player can make their own decisions about which to do first. &quot;You won&#x27;t be able to access everything from the start, but there are a lot of different ways you can approach each area,&quot; Miyazaki explained. &quot;And there&#x27;s a lot of freedom as to which order you tackle different areas as well.&quot;
Players will be able to access a hub area a little later in the game, which you can &quot;branch out from&quot;, and also the six main areas of The Lands Between. &quot;These will be the domains or the areas of the main demigod bosses,&quot; Miyazaki explained. &quot;From here, you&#x27;re able to explore not only these mainline dungeon areas, but also a wide variety of catacombs, castles, and fortresses, which are interspersed throughout the map. These have a range of scale and scope, but the main dungeons are these six - these are the ones that you&#x27;re going to be heading to on your adventures throughout the main world. &quot;

                    <span>Tomorrow&#x27;s update for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla adds a new Mastery Challenge mode to the game. 
Update 1.2.2 will arrive for PC, PlayStation, Stadia and Xbox around 1pm UK time and also adds new skills, river raid cosmetics and other improvements. 
Mastery Challenge mode is the big addition, and can be found at &quot;numerous shrines hidden in the world&quot;, Ubisoft said in its patch notes. Each shrine will host a Trial of the Bear, testing your combat strength, a Trial of the Wolf, testing your ranged ability, and a Trial of the Raven, testing your stealth.

The video, below, includes new Halo Infinite multiplayer gameplay as well as a raft of talking heads from 343.
There&#x27;s a lot to run through, but the highlight for me was the news that Halo Infinite multiplayer lets you bring your own Personal AI onto the battlefield.

                    <span>Lego has detailed a third set of Super Mario Character Packs to be released in blind bags this summer. 
As with previous waves, there are 10 additional enemies and items to collect, and you&#x27;ll need a bit of luck to obtain the full set with no duplicates. (Or to swap with a friend. Or eBay.)
There&#x27;s no release date or price yet for Series 3, but we&#x27;d expect these to cost the same as the last two waves (£3.49/$4.99/€3.99 each) and arrive alongside the upcoming Super Luigi Starter Course on 1st August.

                    <span>Remember that brightly-coloured alien exploration game In Other Waters? Well, the developer is back with another sci-fi offering, although this time it&#x27;s all taking place on a run-down space station. 
Titled Citizen Sleeper, the game was previously teased under the name Project Sidereal, but developer Jump Over The Age revealed the new name and trailer during last night&#x27;s PC Gaming Show. It&#x27;s described as &quot;roleplaying in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism,&quot; with the player taking the role of a &quot;sleeper&quot; - in other words, a digitised human consciousness. The bad news is that you&#x27;re also owned by a huge corporation that wants you back, and your body will deteriorate as part of &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; for escapees. This what happens when billionaires start jetting themselves into space, I guess. 
&quot;Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle,&quot; the Steam description explains. &quot;Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom.&quot;

                    <span>By now, you will likely have seen Bethesda&#x27;s first in-game footage of Starfield, its long-awaited sci-fi role-playing game coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S as a console exclusive on 11th November 2022. 
But how will it play? What will you actually do? And will we ever get to finish that half-eaten space sandwich?
Bethesda has given a couple of interviews which mostly avoid answering specifics, but do touch a bit on some of the above.

                    <span>Last week, Sony announced it had signed a deal with Deviation Games to make a brand new PlayStation IP - the second such deal Sony has announced in recent months.
Deviation Games was set up in November 2019 by former Treyarch Studios developers Dave Anthony and Jason Blundell, both of whom played a key role in the success of the Call of Duty: Black Ops series.
Blundell, one of the chief creators of Call of Duty&#x27;s popular zombies mode, left Treyarch after 13 years at the developer.

                    <span>Somerville has been teased with a number of trailers over the past few years, but during yesterday&#x27;s Xbox-Bethesda showcase we got another look at the game - and now have some idea of what the main characters will look like.  
The sci-fi adventure is being made by Jumpship, an independent studio founded by animator Chris Olsen in collaboration with Playdead co-founder and former CEO Dino Patti. (Playdead created Limbo and its spiritual successor Inside, two very unsettling puzzle-platformers.) 
As you can see from the trailer, Somerville set in a sci-fi world and focuses on the struggles of a family trying to survive a major disaster. &quot;In the wake of catastrophe you must find the means to make your family whole again,&quot; says the official description. &quot;Somerville is a sci-fi adventure grounded in the intimate repercussions of large-scale conflict.

Microsoft is really going to release this dinky desk-sized refrigerator later this year. Like Halo Infinite, it has a vague &quot;holiday 2021&quot; launch date. 
If you stuck around after Microsoft&#x27;s big Xbox and Bethesda Showcase event yesterday, you&#x27;ll have seen the following trailer pop up, showing off how it&#x27;ll look:

Titled Immortality, the game follows the story of Marissa Marcel, an actress who &quot;made three movies&quot; that were never actually released. Oh, and she vanished without a trace, of course. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the teaser trailer that was shown during the Future Games showcase last night:

This dinky puzzle platformer has you controlling a miniature alien astronaut as he explores our world. He&#x27;s aided in his travels by a swarm of mini creatures, named tinykin. 
Sound familiar? While clearly inspired by Nintendo&#x27;s Pikmin, what impressed me here was how snappy and fluid the movement and exploration looks, with tinykin used to create ladders or skate around.

But perhaps it plays better? It&#x27;s impossible to say right now, as the game&#x27;s instantly-dropped PlayStation 5 demo remains broken, and unable to play.
Curious Final Fantasy fans first reported an inability to load the demo after downloading it last night. This morning, our Aoife told me it&#x27;s still not working.

                    <span>Tower defense title Orcs Must Die 3 will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation and Xbox on 23rd July. 
That&#x27;s almost exactly a year on from its original release as a timed-exclusive for Stadia, back in July 2020. The news was confirmed this evening, as part of the PC Gaming Show.
The latest game in the Orcs Must Die series features solo and co-op play, and a campaign set 25 years after that of Orcs Must Die 2. Clearly, you were not successful enough at getting rid of all those orcs last time around.

You&#x27;ll hear people&#x27;s inner thoughts, and use this to learn secrets - though what you do with this information is up to you. Powerful emotions will let Alex experience someone&#x27;s emotional state, and see a changed version of her surroundings, but also put Alex in a place where she&#x27;s experiencing that emotion too.

                    <span>Back in May, rumours began circulating that Square Enix was collaborating with Nioh developer Team Ninja on an action-focussed Final Fantasy spin-off titled Final Fantasy Origin. Well, it turns out those rumours weren&#x27;t far off at all! Square has now officially unveiled Team Ninja&#x27;s action-RPG Final Fantasy spin-off, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins.
Stranger of Paradise follows a band of adventurers who, as the trailer repeatedly reminds us, want to kill chaos. Or at least stab it in the face a few times until its head pops off. &quot;Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine,&quot; Square elaborates in its announcement, &quot;Yet doubts remain-are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?&quot;.
May&#x27;s rumours suggested the game would slot into the action sub-genre occupied by the likes of Team Ninja&#x27;s Nioh games and From Software&#x27;s Souls series, albeit with a more accessible focus, and today&#x27;s reveal appears to support that. Square is promising &quot;exhilarating, action-packed battles&quot; against iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a &quot;world of dark fantasy&quot;.

                    <span>Hitman Sniper: The Shadows is a free-to-play mobile spin-off without hero Agent 47, developed by Hitman Go developer Square Enix Montreal.
Formerly titled Project Hitman Sniper Assassins, the game will take place in a new fictional universe unrelated to the main Hitman series or Hitman Sniper.
Instead of Agent 47, who has disappeared, you&#x27;ll follow a new group of assassins - Soji, Kiya, Kolzak, Knight, and Stone - activated by the International Contract Agency (ICA) following the rise of a new criminal network.

                    <span>Platinum Games&#x27; long-awaited Square Enix title Babylon&#x27;s Fall is now coming to PS5 as well as PS4 and PC. This was announced during Square Enix&#x27;s E3 showcase this evening.
The game&#x27;s also going live-service. The publisher treated audiences to a fairly brief trailer, featuring in-game footage of a frantic 3D action game with lots of armour and magical lightning and some decent operatic music. A follow-up developer interview revealed a game in which teams of players enjoy hack-and-slash combat and explore dungeons in groups of four. These dungeons are located on different floors of a giant tower, and end with a boss.
Regular updates will allow for new moves that can be equipped as skills. There&#x27;s a focus on character customisation and crafting, and a massive emphasis on builds, due to a &quot;Gideon coffin&quot; the characters wear that allows them to equip two additional weapons alongside the weapons they hold in their hands, and, I think, swing them about independently, a la Astral Chain. The game will ship with five weapon types, and there will be a website that allows players to tweak their builds while they&#x27;re away from the game.

                    <span>The Bethesda and Xbox showcase ended with a twist this evening, with the announcement of a brand-new game from Dishonored and Prey developer Arkane Studios.  
Titled Redfall, the game is an open-world co-op shooter arriving in summer 2022. It&#x27;s being developed by Arkane Austin, and judging by the trailer, it looks like it will feature... well, a lot of vampires and shooting.
While we don&#x27;t yet know exactly what the gameplay will look like, it will feature co-op with up to four players. &quot;Redfall blends single and multiplayer options seamlessly, allowing the player to venture into the darkness alone or to squad-up with up to three friends for four-player co-op&quot;, a Bethesda press release explained. &quot;Teammates can try different hero loadouts and combine their strengths to overcome the vampire legion and their brood of maniacal followers.&quot;

Microsoft Flight Simulator received much praise when it launched on PC at the end of last year, in large part thanks to its utterly staggering rendition of the entire world - one that Asobo has continued to build on with regular free sim updates and visual overhauls for the likes of Japan, the United States, France, Benelux, the UK, and Ireland.
&quot;From light planes to wide-body jets,&quot; explains Microsoft of its flight sim, &quot;you&#x27;ll test your piloting skills against the challenges of real-time weather, including accurate worldwide cloud cover and cloud layers, wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, rain, and lightning - all in a dynamic and living world. With the power of satellite data and cloud-based AI, you&#x27;ll travel the entire planet in amazing detail with over 37,000 airports, 2 million cities, 1.5 billion buildings, real mountain ranges, roads, trees, rivers, animals, traffic, and more.&quot;

The Pitt was the second add-on for Fallout 3, Bethesda&#x27;s 2008 sci-fi role-playing game. It was an atmospheric setting that depicted post-nuclear Pittsburgh.
The Pitt arrives as an Expedition for Fallout 76. It&#x27;s a free update that will, for the first time, take players outside of Appalachia. Expeditions are story driven, repeatable missions to various locales in the Fallout universe - starting with The Pitt in 2022. The trailer is below:

As we knew already, this refreshed version of the 20-year-old classic will also include its Lord of Destruction expansion. You&#x27;ll also be able to swap back and forth between the game&#x27;s up-to-4K resolution or original 800x600 look.
There will also be a Diablo Prime Evil Collection, containing Diablo 2: Resurrected and Diablo 3 Eternal Collection. Pre-order either and you&#x27;ll get early access to the game&#x27;s August open beta test on certain platforms.

It&#x27;s set in Mexico, and looks beautiful in gameplay shown today during Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase.
Developed once again by Playground Games, it&#x27;ll be the largest game in the series with the most diverse array of environments to date, Playground said. Expect deserts, jungles, beaches, modern day cities, ancient ruins and a volcano.

                    <span>Age of Empires 4 releases 28th October, 2021 - here&#x27;s a shiny new gameplay trailer that came with the announcement during Xbox&#x27;s E3 conference.
The trailer itself showed off some naval battles, all kinds of horse, camel and elephant cavalry, and some notable historical figures, like Joan of Arc.
There was also plenty of siege and town-based action, and lots of people in armour running at each other on nice grassy hills, which is exactly what we want.

                    <span>Microsoft has offered a first look at Halo Infinite multiplayer.
The video, below, shows some gameplay from the player&#x27;s perspective, with lots of non-gameplay angles, too.
Halo Infinite, due out &quot;holiday 2021&quot; on Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via the Microsoft Store and Steam, as well as Xbox Game Pass day one, offers free-to-play multiplayer.

                    <span>The Outer Worlds is getting a sequel for PC and Xbox Series X/S. It&#x27;s called The Outer Worlds 2. 
In a humorous CGI trailer, developer Obsidian cheekily acknowledged there was not much else to show of the game as yet, and no word on a release window. Still, it&#x27;s nice to know its coming.
&quot;New solar system, new crew, same Outer Worlds,&quot; the trailer&#x27;s description reads. &quot;The Outer Worlds 2 is coming... and when that day is closer we will show you more... but until then enjoy this.&quot;

Picking up after the events of the first game, A Plague Tale: Requiem, as the sequel is known, will follow Amicia and her brother Hugo on a perilous new quest, &quot;doing whatever it takes to survive a brutal, uncaring world.&quot;
That&#x27;s pretty much all we&#x27;re getting at the moment, but expect plenty more details as A Plague Tale: Requiem readies to launch on Xbox and PC - as well as Game Pass - some time next year.

WARNING: BIG SPIDER IN THE TRAILER BELOW.
The update allows for sitting (apparently this was heavily requested), pets and a new giant spider called the Brood Mother. Not fun.

                    <span>Psychonauts 2 is arriving on 25th August, as announced during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase this evening.
The third-person platformer has seen a series of delays, with developer Double Fine previously explaining that it needed more time to bring it up to standard, and that the studio needed time to adjust to its acquisition by Microsoft. It looks like we&#x27;ll finally see the results of all this hard work soon, however, and Double Fine provided a fresh peek at Psychonauts 2 with a gameplay trailer shown during the showcase livestream:  
&quot;Psychonauts 2 is an exciting journey through the mind filled with the signature Double Fine humor and heart, and a touch of next-level platforming,&quot; says the official blog post. &quot;You play as Razputin Aquato, a trained acrobat and powerful young psychic, who has realized his lifelong dream of joining the international psychic espionage organization known as the Psychonauts. But these psychic super spies are in trouble. Raz must use his powers to bring the murderous psychic villain, Maligula, back from the dead! Check out the video above and get psyched!&quot;

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 got a new trailer in Xbox&#x27;s E3 showcase, and it&#x27;s a silly one.
It&#x27;s all in-game captured footage from an Xbox Series X, showing off the chaos of the game&#x27;s new 128-person battles and a range of new toys.
The highlights include a tank being air-dropped into battle via parachute, a grappling hook that should open up some new opportunities for the more ingenuitive campers (and anti-campers), some cross-skyscraper ziplines, a desert cyclone, and a rocket launching into the atmosphere. There&#x27;s a nice tone to it all, too - clearly DICE is aware of the more ridiculous stunts the Battlefield community has become known for pulling off.

Arriving alongside the third season of content for Rare&#x27;s multiplayer pirate game, Sea of Thieves: A Pirate&#x27;s Life, as the crossover is known, will send players on a new five-episode story campaign, playable either solo or in a crew, involving the world&#x27;s greatest Pirate Treasure, which Jack Sparrow just so happens to have stolen. 
Davy Jones, inevitably, isn&#x27;t far behind, and the adventure will see players setting sail to visit new locations from both universes - including some from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park rides that didn&#x27;t quite make it into the movies.

The game features Bake-Off talent Daisy Ridley and James McAvoy, alongside Willem Defoe, who was not on Bake-Off. But that hasn&#x27;t held him back. The game will be out on Xbox and PC, and features a couple facing a home invasion in 12 minute looping bursts.

                    <span>The &quot;emotion-filled narrative, no-filler gameplay, and fast paced combat&quot; of upcoming adventure game Arietta of Spirits will release on PC and consoles, including Nintendo Switch, later this year.
According to the developer, the game tells the story of Arietta and her family, &quot;visiting their Grandmother&#x27;s cabin for the first time after her passing away a year prior&quot;. 
&quot;However, the family trip takes an unexpected turn when Arietta meets a mysterious new friend and gains the ability to see strange spirits that inhabit the island,&quot; the description explains.

                    <span>Far Cry 6&#x27;s season pass will include a remastered copy of fan-favourite Far Cry 3 DLC, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.
Confirmation came during a reveal of Far Cry 6&#x27;s season pass details, which also showed that the DLC lets you play as Vaas, Pagan Min, and Joseph Seed - villains from previous Far Cry games. 
While, admittedly, the teaser doesn&#x27;t tell us much, the neon colours that come in 30 seconds before the end of the trailer are unmistakable. Here, take a look:

                    <span>Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s creator Scott Cawthon has said he &quot;won&#x27;t apologise for&quot; funding US Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, but acknowledged that &quot;with so many people from the LGBT community in the fanbase that I love&quot;, it was &quot;not an option&quot; to ignore fan backlash about his political beliefs.
While many of the candidates Cawthon backed are conservative and sit within America&#x27;s right-leaning Republican party, Cawthon insists that &quot;for those who took the time to look&quot;, they&#x27;d see that the candidates he supported &quot;included men, women, white people, black people, republicans, and democrats&quot;. 
Directly addressing his community on Reddit, Cawthon also took the time to discuss why he supports Republicans despite their broadly anti-LGBTQIA+ stance, stating &quot;even if there were candidates who had better things to say to the LGBT community directly, and bigger promises to make, I believed that their stances on other issues would have ended up doing much greater harm to those communities than good&quot;.

Though still a little ways off - right now, the only release window we have is &quot;2022&quot; - the trailer shows the game&#x27;s gorgeous style and soundtrack, as well as offer a glimpse of the &quot;monstrous troll&quot; that kidnaps the lead character&#x27;s older sister.

                    <span>Town of Light developer LKA has dropped a new video teaser for its upcoming psychological thriller, Martha Is Dead.
The trailer doesn&#x27;t give away much, but it does touch upon the Tale of the White Lady, &quot;the spirit of a murdered, tortured soul whose one goal is to seek a moment&#x27;s relief by dragging others into the water to suffer the same fate&quot;.
The &quot;savage story&quot; told in the video is reportedly based upon a real-life Italian legend, which is purportedly passed down through from generation to generation much as it&#x27;s done in this trailer, with the young Giulia badgering her grandmother to tell her the spooky story of &quot;a drowned maiden, murdered in a fit of jealousy by her lover who now stalks the shores of the lake where she suffered in her final moments&quot;.

The milestone was announced as part of last night&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation (you can catch up now courtesy of Martin&#x27;s excellent on-the-night liveblogging right here).
&quot;This year has been an incredibly intense one for The Crew 2 and everybody at Ivory Tower,&quot; the team explains on the official website. &quot;We managed to deliver an update every four months, as well as a new episode every two months. Our teams have successfully shipped all the content we promised a year ago.&quot;

While developer Ubisoft stopped short of outlining when the betas will launch, it does, however, invite players to register their interest in trying out the &quot;massive multiplayer outdoor sports playground&quot; via upcoming betas.
Even without details on when the beta tests will go live, players interested in trying Riders Republic ahead of its launch can register their interest now on the official website. Though there&#x27;s not much information on the website just yet, it does intimate that betas will be available on all platforms Riders Republic is coming to, including Google Stadia.

It is perhaps surprising to see the visually-impressive role-player getting ported to last-gen - not that we saw much of what that PS4 version might look like today. But this move will, obviously, open up the game to a wider audience.
Today also brought word of Fire &amp; Darkness, a new expansion for Godfall which adds in a new realm, new story, and a hoard of new loot.

There was some eye-catching stuff shown during the show, which was one big piss-take of subscriptions, games as a service and video game monetisation. The video of the entire &quot;Devolver MaxPass+ Showcase | Monetization as a Service&quot; is below, and below that are trailers for all the games.
Let&#x27;s start with Trek to Yomi, a &quot;cinematic tour-de-force&quot; inspired by classic samurai films from director Leonard Menchiari and Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind the 2013 reboot of Shadow Warrior and its 2016 sequel, Shadow Warrior 2.

                    <span>Cast your mind back to 2017, and you might recall Ubisoft announcing it was working on a new video game adaptation of James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar movie. Five years of almost complete silence around the project followed, but all that&#x27;s now changed, with Ubisoft showing the first footage of its Avatar game, now titled Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, during its E3 livestream.
&quot;In this new, standalone story,&quot; explains Ubisoft, &quot;play as a Na&#x27;vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by unique creatures and new characters, and push back the formidable RDA forces that threaten it.&quot;
Ubisoft is calling Frontiers of Pandora a first-person action-adventure and a &quot;immersive, open world experience&quot;, and its trailer - running on the latest version of Ubisoft&#x27;s Snowdrop Engine, according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot - offers a jaunt through a gorgeous rendition of the planet Pandora, complete with all the exotic flora and fauna you could possible hope for.

                    <span>Humankind, Amplitude&#x27;s upcoming, history-spanning 4X game, gets a new closed beta soon, and it&#x27;ll let you play through five of the game&#x27;s six eras. There&#x27;s also a snazzy new trailer to come with the announcement, which you can watch here:
Amplitude&#x27;s done plenty of other betas like this in the past - which the studio refers to as OpenDevs - but this is the furthest into a game of Humankind you&#x27;ll have been able to get, by some way.
You can play either 200 turns or up to the end of the Industrial Era, whichever comes first. Industrial era features include resources like coal and oil, railways, and artillery and air battles - we actually had a chance to explore some more of this ourselves during our latest preview but barely got halfway there, despite playing a good 10 to 15-odd hours, which should give you an idea of just how long you get with this beta.

                    <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla will get a second year of expansions, Ubisoft announced tonight during its E3 Forward event. 
This is the first time any game in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed series has received this level of post-launch support, but this news isn&#x27;t surprising. Firstly, Valhalla has gone down very well. Secondly, as we reported last month, datamining has pointed to the mythical realm of Muspelheim coming down the line. And, indeed, Ubisoft teased Muspelheim tonight.
Before all that, Valhalla has its previously-announced Siege of Paris expansion coming this summer. No release date for that was shared, but we got a good look at footage. Ubisoft also confirmed the fan-favourite &quot;black box&quot; missions from the series&#x27; past will return here. These are assassination target opportunities where you have a set location and multiple methods to take down a target.

                    <span>Yes, the Just Dance franchise is still going strong, and we now have a release date for the next entry in the series: and it&#x27;s 4th November. 
The news was unveiled during this evening&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream. The announcement also featured celebrity performer and choreographer Todrick Hall (who you may recognise from his appearances on RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race). He released a popular single called Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels in 2019, and this song is set to be included in the line-up for Just Dance 2022. 
The game is due to feature 40 tracks in total, and along with Todrick Hall&#x27;s music you can expect to find Level Up by Ciara and Believer by Imagine Dragons.

                    <span>The ever-popular Rainbow Six Siege will get crossplay support, Ubisoft has announced, though PlayStation and Xbox platforms will have to wait some time.
Crossplay and cross-progression between PC, Stadia and Luna will arrive on 30th June, Ubisoft said tonight during its E3 Ubisoft Forward presentation. 
PlayStation and Xbox crossplay will arrive later, in &quot;early 2022&quot;. At that point, cross-progression between all platforms will then be possible.

In SkateBird, players take on the role of a &quot;chill little skateboarding bird&quot; whose human friend is never home to play, thanks to their job. Luckily, the bird is an enterprising sort and, to help pass the time, has constructed a miniature skating paradise in the form of a homemade skatepark.
Here, players can trick and grind, completing missions and skating their best skate to unlock new bird-sized courses, attract a loyal bird following, and somehow fix their human friend&#x27;s life.

                    <span>The E3 leaks keep on coming: this time it&#x27;s Yakuza: Like a Dragon for Xbox Game Pass.
Confirmation comes from a snapshot of Yakuza: Like a Dragon&#x27;s listing on the Brazilian Microsoft Store. There was mention of &quot;included with Game Pass&quot; for accompanying content. It looks like this reference to Game Pass was swiftly removed, but not before Twitter user @pedroxbz noticed.
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s Yakuza: Like a Dragon launched in Japan for PlayStation 4 in January 2020, before coming out internationally in November that year on multiple platforms. It was a launch title for Xbox Series X and S. It came out on PlayStation 5 four months later, in March.

                    <span>A third Ubisoft E3 reveal has leaked.
As spotted by The Riff Repeater, the latest Gibson email blast fully revealed Rocksmith+, which goes into PC closed beta today.
Rocksmith is Ubisoft&#x27;s guitar teaching game. In April 2020, developer Ubisoft San Francisco announced DLC for the original Rocksmith had come to an end, with the team moving on to a new project. Perhaps Rocksmith+ is it.

                    <span>Ubisoft has suffered another leak for one of its games, this time DLC for the upcoming Far Cry 6.
A video advert was spotted by fans playing on YouTube, and although Ubisoft has issued copyright claims in a bid to scrub the leak from the internet, it&#x27;s readily available.
According to the advert, the Far Cry 6 season pass lets you play as villains from previous Far Cry games. Vaas from Far Cry 3 is shown, as is Pagan from Far Cry 4 and Joseph from Far Cry 5.

                    <span>Back 4 Blood looks set for Xbox Game Pass day one.
Redditor JohnTLH spotted the news in the YouTube description for the upcoming Back 4 Blood PvP video reveal, which is set for 10pm UK time on Sunday 13th June.
That reveal follows Microsoft&#x27;s E3 press conference, which kicks off at 6pm the same day. I suspect the announcement will be made - officially! - during Microsoft&#x27;s press conference.

Speaking in the latest Axios Gaming newsletter, Ryan was asked about a 2017 interview with Time in which he recalled seeing different versions of Gran Turismo running side-by-side on PSone, PS2, PS3 and PS4.
&quot;The PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?&quot; he said at the time.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been almost a year and a half since our coins were well and truly tossed by Netflix&#x27;s inaugural season of The Witcher, so anticipation is understandably high for news on Season Two. As part of its Geeked Week of reveals, Netflix teased a first look at things to come, and it&#x27;s delivered exactly that - albeit limiting itself to just 12 seconds of footage.
Even before the conclusion of The Witcher&#x27;s well-received first season, Netflix confirmed an eventual return for Geralt, Jennefer, Ciri, and Jaskier (as played by Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan, and Joey Batey respectively).
Since then, we&#x27;ve learned that the second season - which promises to dial back on the time-hopping antics of its predecessor - will usher in new cast members including Simon Callow as the Dorian detective Codringher, Silent Witness&#x27; Liz Carr as business partner Fenn, Bridgerton&#x27;s Adjoa Andoh as priestess Nenneke, and Brave New World&#x27;s Cassie Clare as Phillippa Eilhart, sorceress and advisor to King Vizimir.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s animated adaptation of legendary video game series Castlevania is now at the end of its acclaimed four-season run, and fans have been wondering what comes next. Today brings answer: more Castlevania, but different.
Castlevania&#x27;s future on Netflix was left in doubt when the streaming service opted to wind up the series in its current guise after showrunner Warren Ellis departed from the show following allegations of sexual misconduct. However, subsequent rumours suggested a spin-off was in the works, and Netflix has now made that official.
With Castlevania&#x27;s current run now concluded, Netflix is working on a brand-new series that will take Richter Belmont (son of original series leads Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes) and Maria Renard - both familiar characters to game fans - to 1792 France for an adventure that unfolds against the backdrop of the French Revolution.

                    <span>Netflix&#x27;s apparent mission to give every single video game in the universe the TV show treatment is continuing with three newly announced animated adaptations of Ubisoft properties: Splinter Cell, Far Cry, and unforgettable Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon.
A Splinter Cell animated adaptation was first rumoured last July, but Ubisoft and Netflix have now made the show official. It&#x27;ll follows the adventures of iconic video game series protagonist Sam Fisher after he&#x27;s recruited to work for the NSA&#x27;s mysterious Echelon Division.
Expect black ops missions, stealth, and military tactics in a series that&#x27;s being written by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad. That&#x27;s pretty much all Netflix has shared right now, other than this appropriately shadowy glimpse of Sam as he&#x27;ll appear in the show:

                    <span>Netflix has a lot of video game adaptations in the works at the moment, and we&#x27;ll be seeing the fruits of those ongoing labours later today as its Geeked Week of reveals concludes. It promises to be a busy one - debuting footage from the likes of The Witcher Season 2 and Cuphead - but first there are the opening three minutes of the streaming service&#x27;s CGI Resident Evil series ahead of its release in July. 
Known as Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, this animated adaption takes place several years after the events of Resident Evil 4, with Leon S. Kennedy once again serving as the US president&#x27;s bodyguard - which would probably seem like a walk in the park compared to his usual adventures if it wasn&#x27;t for the threat of an imminent zombie outbreak.
Claire Redfield also plays a role in Leon&#x27;s latest adventure, embarking on her own investigation as (the supposedly canon) events unfold, and if you&#x27;re curious to see how proceedings kick off, you can do that via the first three minutes of the show below.

Lost Ark is already out in Korea, Japan and Russia, and has more than eight million concurrent players, Amazon said. It&#x27;s developed by South Korean studio Smilegate RPG, whose parent company developed the phenomenally popular first-person shooter Crossfire.

Arc System Works issued the warning in a post on Strive&#x27;s Steam page just a few hours before the game went live on PC.
The fighting game does support 4K resolutions, but is currently experiencing severe slowdowns during specific situations in battle, such as when counter-hitting, Arc System Works said.

The issue shows up as error code 2123-1502, for which there are steps on Nintendo&#x27;s customer support site. But fans affected by the problem say these do not fix the bug in most cases.
A spate of reports flagging up this error code erupted this week when Nintendo released a small and otherwise unimportant system update.

In a blog post, Bethesda said the Nuclear Winter mode will come to an end in September.
Explaining the decision, Bethesda said Nuclear Winter had suffered from a lack of players, which meant it had become difficult to create full lobbies in a reasonable matchmaking time.

                    <span>Everyone&#x27;s doing a Nintendo Direct these days, and now top indie publisher Annapurna Interactive is no different. 
The first ever Annapurna Interactive Showcase will be broadcast on 29th July at 8pm UK time (midday Pacific) in all of the usual streaming places. 
Expect updates on upcoming Annapurna games (there are a lot!) such as The Artful Escape, Skin Deep, Solar Ash, Neon White and Stray. New game announcements will also feature, as Annapurna adds to its bulging top-tier indie roster.

                    <span>Last night&#x27;s flurry of Summer Game Fest announcements included a 22nd October release date for House of Ashes, the third game in Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures Anthology.
A fresh trailer also includes a blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it reveal of the game&#x27;s monster big bad (it&#x27;s right at the very end, if you want to avoid spoilers).
Last month I sat down with House of Ashes director Will Doyle to discuss the game&#x27;s Iraq War setting, horror influences and historical horror.

                    <span>We now have a fossil of a squid eating a crustacean while it is being eaten by a shark.
As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>For three years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Australian Federal Police owned and operated a commercial encrypted phone app, called AN0M, that was used by organized crime around the world. Of course, the police were able to read everything — I don’t even know if this qualifies as a backdoor. This week, the world’s police organizations announced 800 arrests based on text messages sent over the app. We’ve seen law enforcement take over encrypted apps before: for example, EncroChat.

                    <span>Last Stop, the supernatural &quot;anthology drama&quot; from  Virginia developer Variable State, finally has a release date, and will be making its way to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 22nd July.
Last Stop is described as a game about &quot;secret lives, the ties that bind, and how magic can be found in the mundane&quot;, and follows the interweaving, supernaturally tinged tales of three separate characters in modern day London.
There&#x27;s Donna, a &quot;spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life&quot;; John, an &quot;overworked middle-aged single dad&quot; who&#x27;s &quot;burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent&quot;; plus Meera, a &quot;ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work.&quot;

                    <span>Double Fine and iam8bit&#x27;s latest indie-focussed Day of the Devs showcase has been and gone, offering a closer look at a variety of new titles heading release-ward in the coming months and beyond. Most aren&#x27;t new new games in terms of reveals but there&#x27;s some cracking stuff in there, and, in case you missed it, here&#x27;s everything - from the sci-fi sequel-ing of Axiom Verge 2 to the cooking delights of Hot Pot - that put in an appearance during the show. Do note that the livestream features some extra gameplay not found in the accompanying videos below.
Axiom Verge 2
Developer Thomas Happ&#x27;s Axiom Verge 2, the sequel to his acclaimed 2005 retro-styled Metroid-a-like, returned with brand-new gameplay, highlighting some the abilities that new protagonist Indra - a melee-based character, in contrast to her gun-focussed predecessor - will wield, including new hacking abilities that&#x27;ll even let players complete avoid boss battles. Happ also dropped the news that Axiom Verge 2 will also be coming to PlayStation 4 and PS5 alongside the previously announced Switch and PC versions.

                    <span>Midway through this evening&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, CD Projekt released a statement discussing the circulation of stolen data from a ransomware attack - and the company is concerned it may contain employee and contractor data.
Earlier this year CD Projekt announced it had been hit by a ransomware attack, and last week we began to hear reports this stolen data was being actively shared online. Several developer-made bug montages emerged from this, but source code for several CD Projekt games (including The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077) is also reported to have been shared, and CD Projekt is concerned employee and contractor data is caught up in this.
&quot;... We have learned new information regarding the breach, and now have reason to believe that internal data illegally obtained during the attack is currently being circulated on the internet,&quot; the statement says. &quot;We are not able to confirm the exact contents of the data in question, though we believe it may include current/former employee and contractor details in addition to data related to our games. Furthermore, we cannot confirm whether or not the data involved may have been manipulated or tampered with following the breach.&quot;

                    <span>Next week&#x27;s Xbox Summer Game Fest demo event has been detailed. It&#x27;ll bring us more than 40 demos of upcoming, unreleased games on Xbox Series S and X, and Xbox One. The demos will be available for a week, from 15th June to 21st. After that, they&#x27;ll disappear.
Only a handful of the titles have been revealed so far. Thankfully, one of them is Sable, the gorgeous-looking desert sci-fi game which we&#x27;ll have a write-up on very soon. Another is Tunic, the adorably cute, Zelda-like adventure game. Both of these were glimpsed in the Summer Games Fest broadcast this evening.
The other games on the list are The Riftbreaker, which I&#x27;ve tried on PC (and really liked), and Echo Generation and Lake.

                    <span>Axiom Verge 2, the highly anticipated sequel to developer Thomas Happ&#x27;s acclaimed retro-styled Metroid-a-like, is coming to PS4 and PlayStation 5 alongside the previously announced Switch and Epic Games Store versions.
The original Axiom Verge, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched back in 2015, earning plenty of praise for its elegant blend of familiar nostalgia-tweaking Metroid staples and thrilling new twists.
Axiom Verge 2, which sends players on a quest to &quot;discover the origins of the Axiom Verge universe, expands on its celebrated predecessor in a multitude of ways. There&#x27;s an entirely new world, for instance, as well as new enemies, and a new protagonist.

                    <span>Former Call of Duty: Black Ops developers are making a brand new IP for PlayStation.
Deviation Games was set up by CEO Dave Anthony and director Jason Blundell, both of whom worked on Call of Duty at Treyarch.
Blundell, one of the chief creators of Call of Duty&#x27;s popular zombies mode, left Treyarch in 2020 after 13 years.

The hugely-anticipated collaboration between Souls developer FromSoftware, creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin was shown properly for the first time at the end of tonight&#x27;s Summer Games Fest event, closing the show.
The game&#x27;s website has revealed further information, including the fact you&#x27;ll be able to &quot;traverse the breathtaking world on foot or on horseback, alone or online with other players&quot;.

                    <span>Sky: Children of the Light, the acclaimed &quot;social adventure&quot; from Journey and Flower developer ThatGameCompany, will be making its way to Switch on 29th June.
Sky, which debuted on iOS in 2019 before heading to Android, unfolds across the seven realms of a beautiful kingdom of billowing clouds, which players can explore as their whims take them.
There are puzzley-platformy elements alongside delicate story vignettes, and it&#x27;s all build around a gently collaborative multiplayer aspect, where co-operation is integral to progression, designed to encourage &quot;compassion, friendship, and altruism&quot;.

                    <span>One indie game which caught my eye during tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest stream was Planet of Lana, a beautiful side-scrolling platformer coming in 2022. 
It&#x27;s the work of new outfit Wishfully, and has a Limbo-esque vibe to it. While more colourful, there&#x27;s definitely something eerie about watching Planet of Lana&#x27;s protagonist and her little friend see rockets falling from the sky.
&quot;Planet of Lana is a cinematic puzzle adventure framed by an epic sci-fi saga that stretches across centuries and galaxies,&quot; Wishfully describes.

                    <span>Stray Bombay, the studio formed by Left 4 Dead and Portal writer Chet Faliszek, and Riot Games designer Kimberley Voll, has revealed its new game The Anacrusis.
It&#x27;s - like Left 4 Dead - a co-operative shooter for four people, and it takes place on an abandoned starship on the edge of explored space. There you&#x27;ll fight seemingly endless hordes of aliens in an &quot;infinitely replayable fight&quot;, according to Summer Games Fest host Geoff Keighley, who announced the game. You&#x27;ll unlock perks and weapons and &quot;new ways to play you can share with your team&quot;, said Keighley.
Despite the theme, Anacrusis looks like a very bright and upbeat game. It&#x27;s not dissimilar to the Portal series, actually, with brightly lit, clean sci-fi scenery, and some arty splashes of turquoise and orangey-red here and there. Very pleasant.

                    <span>It seems there&#x27;s a whole lot of content on the horizon for social deduction game Among Us, as developer InnerSloth has detailed its upcoming plans for 2021 - and it&#x27;s looking like a busy schedule. 
The big news revealed during Summer Game Fest is that a new mode is on the way, called Hide and Seek. It seems seekers will be given a very small radius in which they can see other players, leaving it up to those hiding to out-manoeuvre their pursuers. 
And that&#x27;s not the only major gameplay change - after modders started doing it themselves, some new roles are officially being added to the mix, including Sheriff and Scientist roles. As of yet there&#x27;s no details on how these work (even on the roadmap explainer page), so I imagine this will be explained at a later date.

                    <span>Koch Media has announced a new publishing label called Prime Matter - and a new Painkiller game.
The Deep Silver parent company announced Prime Matter alongside a dozen games it&#x27;s set to publish, including Payday 3 from Starbreeze and a real-time strategy Crossfire game from Hardspace: Shipbreaker and Homeworld 3 developer Blackbird Interactive.
The first Painkiller game was developed by Outriders studio People Can Fly and came out in 2004. Painkiller: Hell &amp; Damnation, a partial remake of and sequel to the original, launched in 2012. We haven&#x27;t had a new Painkiller since.

                    <span>Fans of Ska Studios&#x27; stupendous 2D Souls-like Salt and Sanctuary should prepare to do a tiny cheer; the developer has announced that a follow-up, Salt and Sacrifice, is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC early next year.
Salt and Sacrifice, much like its predecessor, sports side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat. This time, however, players, in the role of a Marked Inquisitor, can choose from one of eight classes - Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage - as they battle their way through the world of Alterstone Kingdom.
&quot;Track down over 20 types of Mages in abandoned villages, dungeons, tomb-temples, and more,&quot; explains Ska in its announcement. &quot;Ransack their remains to forge new weapons and armour with Runic Arts and become even stronger for the battles ahead.&quot;

                    <span>Coming-of-age title Sable is due to arrive on September 23rd, it&#x27;s been revealed during tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest.
The game was first announced back at E3 2018, but a series of delays saw its release date pushed back to 2021. Players take on the role of Sable, and embark on a rite of passage that sees her leave her tribe to explore the world on her hoverbike. It&#x27;s got a gorgeous art style that&#x27;s inspired by French artist Mobieus, and a sci-fi open world that feels very reminiscent of some of the wrecks seen in Star Wars. Oh, and it&#x27;s set to launch on PC and Xbox. 
Sable is being developed by a small team in the UK called Shedworks, who - you guessed it - work out of a garden shed. I visited Shedworks back in 2018 to learn about Sable&#x27;s story - and also check out the shed for myself.

As in the original Jurassic World Evolution, which released back in 2018, players will be tasked with building and maintaining their own dinosaur theme park - laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and, of course, making sure the attractions don&#x27;t eat the guests. 
Moving away from Muertes Archipelago, Jurassic World Evolution 2 will let players build parks across a diverse range of new environments - including dense forests and scorched deserts - utilising &quot;deeper management tools and creative options&quot;, including new building types.

                    <span>Death Stranding is coming to the PlayStation 5 in the form of a Director&#x27;s Cut.
Creator Hideo Kojima revealed the news this evening during the Summer Game Fest, after an extended Zoom call with best buddy Geoff Keighley. 
Footage of the Director&#x27;s Cut showed a bizarre scene where protagonist Sam Bridges picked up a Metal Gear Solid-esque cardboard box, emptied it of oranges, and then climbed inside. Bizarre, but we&#x27;d have hoped for nothing less.

                    <span>Control is free on the Epic Games Store.
Remedy&#x27;s supernatural third-person action adventure is free on Epic&#x27;s store now until 4pm UK time on 17th June. Control is normally £24.99.
Donlan penned Eurogamer&#x27;s Control review, saying &quot;giddy action and astonishing art design combine in one of the great locations of modern video games&quot;. Well worth grabbing, then, if you don&#x27;t have it already.

                    <span>Earlier this year, developer Iron Gate released a pretty ambitious roadmap for Valheim that included several major updates and a host of smaller improvements: but as the months passed, it began to seem less and less likely that Iron Gate would meet all these targets. Sure enough, the Iron Gate team has confirmed that it&#x27;s had to revise its roadmap for 2021 - and that includes a trimmed-down version of its update schedule. 
&quot;As we&#x27;re sure lots of you suspected, we won&#x27;t be able to deliver four updates this year,&quot; Iron Gate explained in an update post on Steam. &quot;Instead, we&#x27;re now planning to launch Hearth and Home in Q3 2021, and we&#x27;re temporarily taking down the roadmap whilst we make some changes. We are sorry it&#x27;s taken us so long to update you.&quot;
Iron Gate went on to explain that it hadn&#x27;t been prepared for &quot;such a large influx of players&quot;, and the game&#x27;s popularity highlighted plenty of bugs that needed urgent fixes. &quot;Our priority has been to make the current experience as stable as possible and this has meant new content has taken a backseat. To put it clearly; we haven&#x27;t been able to focus all of our resources on Hearth and Home until May.

First up, Microsoft said it&#x27;s working to put Xbox in TVs.
The company is working with TV manufacturers to &quot;embed&quot; the Xbox experience directly into internet-connected televisions with no extra hardware required except a controller.

                    <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has issued a thinly-veiled dig at Sony over its PC strategy.
Speaking at part of a pre-E3, &quot;What&#x27;s Next for Gaming&quot; virtual briefing shown to press this week, Spencer took aim at Sony&#x27;s strategy of releasing its PlayStation-exclusives on PC years after they come out on console.
Here&#x27;s the quote from Spencer in full:

Liz Hamren, CVP of Gaming Experiences &amp; Platforms, said Microsoft was already working on new hardware, &quot;some of which won&#x27;t come to light for years.&quot;
&quot;Cloud is key to our hardware and Game Pass roadmaps, but no one should think we&#x27;re slowing down on our core console engineering. In fact, we&#x27;re accelerating it,&quot; Hamren said in a video briefing shown to press this week.

Made by King, Activision&#x27;s mobile arm, the hugely-lucrative On the Run launches its third season, Battle of the Dragons, today, 10th June. 
Spyro will make an appearance, but can you actually play as Spyro? It looks like you&#x27;ll get a Spyro-themed skin for Crash - so maybe that&#x27;s as close as it gets.

                    <span>PUBG&#x27;s bots have never been particularly popular with the community ever since they were introduced to public matchmaking, but a recent update transformed the bumbling bots into something far worse: horrifyingly accurate aimbots. 
Patch 12.1 brought with it some changes to bot AI, which were - in theory - supposed to improve their behaviour, but it seems PUBG Corp made them a little too good. Players took to Reddit to document these machines of terror, pointing out that they were behaving like cheaters. Those who spectated the bots or replayed death cams discovered they effectively had wall hacks and aimbot enabled, with the bots spinning around to obliterate players with unnerving speed and accuracy. 
&quot;They&#x27;re &#x27;aim bots&#x27; now and that&#x27;s no joke,&quot; said appropriately-named Reddit user Morbidly Tortured. &quot;I got taken out by a bot from 200 meters out. It auto locked on to me and hit every shot. I almost reported it until I spectated for about three minutes and noticed it was a bot with how it was running, stopping, going prone.&quot;

It also brought us details on the three different editions of Battlefield 2042 available, with different prices for its cheapest edition depending on where you&#x27;ll play. 
For this basic edition, Battlefield 2042 costs £10/$10 less on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One than you&#x27;ll pay on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. For fancier editions, it&#x27;s £10/$10 less on PC only.

                    <span>The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is out now - and its PC port has been found wanting.
The PC version of this action game collection is bare bones, with severely limited customisation and graphics options.
It does not support mouse and keyboard, forcing PC users to play with a controller. A controller is perhaps preferable for Ninja Gaiden, but to not provide the option of mouse and keyboard is shocking.

                    <span>“Markpainting” is a clever technique to watermark photos in such a way that makes it easier to detect ML-based manipulation:
An image owner can modify their image in subtle ways which are not themselves very visible, but will sabotage any attempt to inpaint it by adding visible information determined in advance by the markpainter.
One application is tamper-resistant marks. For example, a photo agency that makes stock photos available on its website with copyright watermarks can markpaint them in such a way that anyone using common editing software to remove a watermark will fail; the copyright mark will be markpainted right back. So watermarks can be made a lot more robust...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming but Overwatch is finally getting cross-play support, enabling players to compete with and against one another regardless of platform.
Game director Aaron Keller announced the feature during Blizzard&#x27;s latest developer update, working through some of the special matchmaking rules that&#x27;ll be introduced once cross-play arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
Essentially, while parties of console-only players will continue to be placed with other consoles players during matchmaking, and those on PC will continue to be placed with other PC players, mixed teams will be placed in the PC matchmaking pool. The one exception to this is Competitive Play mode, which will not permit mixed groups at all.

                    <span>Call of Duty: Warzone will get a Vanguard-themed map set in the Pacific theatre of World War 2, according to a new report.
VGC said the battle royale will get an entirely new Warzone map - &quot;the series&#x27; largest and most ambitious to date&quot; - to coincide with the November release of Sledgehammer&#x27;s World War 2-themed premium entry, Call of Duty: Vanguard.
The current 1984 version of Verdansk map launched in April - half a year after Treyarch&#x27;s Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War came out.

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted the world to think differently about remote work, with more companies allowing employees to pick between working from home or the office. With the vaccine rollout now in progress, it seems some companies are making plans for what their workplace structure will look like in the future - and that includes Ubisoft. 
Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier earlier this week tweeted that Ubisoft had emailed employees about a new &quot;hybrid&quot; work structure, and Ubisoft has now published this email on its official website.
&quot;In summary the future will be hybrid, offering the majority of Ubisoft team members the opportunity to balance home and office work,&quot; the post explains. &quot;This has been designed based on our learnings from the past year and from your feedback; this &#x27;test and learn&#x27; approach is one we will continue to adopt moving forward.&quot;

                    <span>After a string of rumours, whispers and leaks EA has finally lifted the veil of the latest Battlefield, seeing the flagship first-person shooter moving away from the historical setting of recent entries to a near-future backdrop - with this year&#x27;s model subsequently called Battlefield 2042. In a break from other recent traditions, it&#x27;ll also do away with a single-player campaign, and there are no plans for an accompanying battle royale mode.
Battlefield 2042 will instead focus on its multiplayer offering, supporting 128 players on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game support 64 players. There will also be the option of playing against AI bots, either solo or with a squad of friends. 
&quot;I think that&#x27;s just something that enables us to really lean into what we are best at,&quot; Battlefield 2042 design director Daniel Berlin told Eurogamer about the lack of a single-player campaign - something that&#x27;s been a series mainstay since Battlefield 3. &quot;If you look at the DNA of the studio, what we&#x27;ve been doing for so long, we just said you know what, we&#x27;re not going to have a traditional single-player campaign this time around, but we&#x27;re going to put all that emphasis and all those resources into building depth into the multiplayer. Because that is what we do best.&quot;

                    <span>Sony has released an update for the PlayStation 5 and the DualSense controller.
The update, which brings the PS5 up to version 21.01-03.20.00 (just rolls off the tongue!) makes a short list of changes, as detailed on the PlayStation website:
Of note is the update to the DualSense controller. Sony said it improves stability, which isn&#x27;t particularly helpful. Redditor Heymodspleasehelp noticed a controller battery indicator bug was now fixed. &quot;It was at zero percent before I updated now it&#x27;s at two bars,&quot; they said.

German player Marco Reus is also joining Epic&#x27;s beautiful game, and the two will come with the usual array of emotes and back blings. 
Harry Kane has an emote named &quot;HurriKane&quot;. That&#x27;s some top punning there.

                    <span>Fortnite&#x27;s laid back Team Rumble mode has been quietly revamped as part of the game&#x27;s new extraterrestrial season - and fans aren&#x27;t best pleased with the changes. 
Tweaks to Team Rumble&#x27;s relaxed formula had felt overdue, as things had begun to feel a little too relaxed in recent months and it had become common for matches to peter out towards the end. 
But Epic&#x27;s unexplained changes - apparently designed to speed up the mode&#x27;s pacing and match length - have gone overboard, fans say, and ruin the ability to use Team Rumble to check off in-game challenges.

                    <span>Just in time for the launch of Marvel&#x27;s new Disney+ show Loki, the Disney+ 30-day trial has returned to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving members a free month of access to the streaming service. 
As explained on Xbox Wire, the free trial can be claimed through Xbox Game Pass Perks, and can be activated any time from now until 30th September. If you claimed the previous Disney+ Perk, you should still be able to claim this one - but it can only be activated on a new Disney+ subscriber account. 
If you&#x27;re thinking of only using the trial for that 30-day period, remember that like most subscription trials you&#x27;ll need to manually cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period if you don&#x27;t want to get charged for the next month. So if you&#x27;re planning on tuning in just for Loki, you might want to wait a bit before activating your trial: the first episode releases today, but the finale airs on 14th July. Or for Clone Wars spin-off series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, you&#x27;ll want to make sure your trial period includes the finale airing on 30th July.

                    <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s The Division franchise will be absent from E3, the publisher has said. 
There were hopes we&#x27;d get more information on Heartland, the upcoming free-to-play The Division spin-off due later in 2021 or early in 2022. 
This is the first of Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming big budget free-to-play experiments with its core franchises. A few bits and pieces have leaked out from closed testing, despite Ubisoft&#x27;s wishes.

                    <span>We&#x27;re still waiting for that big Heath and Home update, but in the meantime developer Iron Gate has rolled out another small patch to fix some of Valheim&#x27;s bugs. This patch makes two previously-bugged raid events actually trigger in-game, and provides a number of other handy fixes to make your time in the 10th world slightly easier. Slightly. 
The two events fixed in this update are &quot;you are being hunted&quot; and &quot;the horde is attacking&quot;, which were previously in the game files but didn&#x27;t trigger as expected. According to the Valheim wiki, the hunt event is supposed to spawn a bunch of wolves, while the horde event should summon a goblin army of Fulings (including Berserkers and Shamans). 
The exact conditions for triggering these events are currently unknown, but the pattern established by previous events suggests the hunt event could require killing one wolf and Moder, while the horde raid should occur in-between killing Moder and the final boss. So if you&#x27;re currently in the late-game, things are about to get a bit spicier.

                    <span>Bandai Namco will hop onto E3 2021&#x27;s virtual stage next Tuesday 15th June at 10.25pm UK time, as part of the online event&#x27;s livestream.
All eyes will be on the publisher for word of Elden Ring, the much-hyped collaboration between Souls developer FromSoftware and Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin.
Reports swirled earlier this year of a proper look at Elden Ring being imminent - though for whatever reason, this never ended up coming to pass.

                    <span>When you talk about AWS billing, you’re talking about AWS architecture. Most folks don’t recognize that they’re the same thing.

                    <span>Henry Farrell and I published a paper on fixing American democracy: “Rechanneling Beliefs: How Information Flows Hinder or Help Democracy.”
It’s much easier for democratic stability to break down than most people realize, but this doesn’t mean we must despair over the future. It’s possible, though very difficult, to back away from our current situation towards one of greater democratic stability. This wouldn’t entail a restoration of a previous status quo. Instead, it would recognize that the status quo was less stable than it seemed, and a major source of the tensions that have started to unravel it. What we need is a dynamic stability, one that incorporates new forces into American democracy rather than trying to deny or quash them...</span>

                    <span>Developer RageSquid&#x27;s extreme downhill biking game Descenders is now available on Xbox Series X/S, bringing with it a free next-gen enhancements update for all Xbox One owners that introduces a 120fps mode, PC cross-play, and more.
Descenders, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, serves up an exhilarating freeriding experience as players - either solo or competitively - race, trick, and flip their way across a procedurally generated world. It was warmly received at launch, but really made its mark - and found a significant audience - once it released on Xbox Game Pass.
Following the game&#x27;s well-deserved, and continuing, success on Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service, RageSquid announced it was working on a next-gen enhancements upgrade for Xbox Series X/S - and that update is now finally here.

                    <span>Playdate, the mini monochrome handheld with a crank, will become available for pre-order in July priced $179 (UK price TBA). 
The exact date will be announced closer to the time, with a week&#x27;s warning so you can be ready. The first units are &quot;expected&quot; to ship later in 2021.
Those details are different to those first announced back in May 2019, when the price was mentioned as $149. But Playdate&#x27;s offering has now been improved, with a 4GB memory instead of 2GB, and an initial 24 game season: double the games originally planned.

                    <span>You may have already seen some mutterings about this on social media, but E3&#x27;s online portal opened up to press this week - and to nobody&#x27;s surprise, it&#x27;s a real mess. This year&#x27;s E3 is all-online thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the portal is supposed to be some sort of substitute for the physical show, featuring virtual booths for exhibitors, online events, and a variety of articles and bits of content about games.
The portal goes a little further than you might expect, however, with old-school internet forums, an avatar system and a gamified rewards system. The latter is what really caught my attention, as not only can you earn points from nosing around the portal, but you can also compete in online leaderboards  to see who is The Biggest E3 Fan. Naturally, this appealed to my competitive side and I set out to land myself a spot at the top of the virtual podium. &quot;With a limited pool of games media, this will be a cinch,&quot; I thought. But alas, my attempts to do so were foiled by an unexpected enemy: the E3 portal itself. 
Things started off pretty well. After doing some strange password reset shenanigans to actually get into my account, the E3 website presented me with an avatar creator (if you&#x27;ve ever heard of a picrew, it&#x27;s basically that). I don&#x27;t know why the avatar creator exists, but I think it might also be the best part of the E3 website. It&#x27;s surprisingly lenient with what it will allow you to do - there are colour wheels for your hair and eyes, and you can even move your facial features around. Don&#x27;t expect the sort of silliness you can get from something like Nintendo&#x27;s Mii Maker, but the E3 avatar creator isn&#x27;t afraid to get a little weird:

                    <span>Capcom has detailed exactly when you&#x27;ll be able to tune in to its E3 showcase: Monday, 14th June at 10.30pm UK time. 
Expect updates on what&#x27;s next for Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise, as well as a look ahead to July&#x27;s Monster Hunter Stories 2 and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
So, what do we expect for Resident Evil Village? Well, Capcom is yet to talk about post-launch single-player support for the game, if there is any. More likely, perhaps, we may get a glimpse of new bits and pieces coming to its PVE Mercenaries mode.

                    <span>Is your Russian feeling a little rusty? Not to worry, as an English translation for Fallout 2 mod Olympus 2207 has finally been released - so you can put the Russian dictionary down for now. 
Olympus 2207 is a huge total conversion mod for Fallout 2 that was released back in December 2014, and at long last, it now has an official English translation. The developers used Fallout 2&#x27;s engine and basic mechanics to create a new story that&#x27;s unconnected to the Fallout series: it adapts features like Fallout 2&#x27;s skills and perks system, but adds new graphics, additional gameplay mechanics, and - of course - a bunch of new stories and quests. There&#x27;s even a crafting system, a mini-game for hacking electronic panels, and a flexible structure with no main quest. &quot;Do you want to become the tyrant of Radius, or do you want to improve the lives of everyone in it?,&quot; the official mod page explains. &quot;The choice is yours!&quot;
As explained in the lore section of the mod&#x27;s website, the game takes place in the year 2207 in the Silicon Valley region of the US. The Great War of 2013 created an irradiated wasteland, and while some managed to escape into improvised shelters (or a luxurious vault called Livos), many had to &quot;adapt to the new conditions on the evolutionary, genetic level&quot;. Sounds rough. Anyway, some lucky survivors found themselves inside a skyscraper called Olympus when this all went down. The game centres on this skyscraper, which everyone in the wasteland seems desperate to enter: it promises energy with its solar panels and protection from the horrors outside. If you can get past the guards at the bottom, however.

                    <span>Fortnite has beamed down its extra-terrestrial-themed Chapter 2 Season 7, which lets your ride UFOs and play as Superman.
There&#x27;s also a revamped battle pass system which has done away with the traditional levels 1-100 grind. Instead, levelling will give you &quot;Stars&quot; to spend on specific rewards you want, laid out over pages. Some items will require you to have finished off the rest of the page first, tempting you to level up further, but this should make nabbing individual items easier.
In the story trailer, we see the Fortnite island&#x27;s inhabitants react to the arrival of an Independence Day-sized UFO, which hovers over the island and then appears to suck up its Zero Point energy source, destroying last season&#x27;s Spire and primal ruins in the process.

                    <span>“If you think any of these systems are going to work as expected in wartime, you’re fooling yourself.”
That was Bruce’s response at a conference hosted by U.S. Transportation Command in 2017, after learning that their computerized logistical systems were mostly unclassified and on the internet. That may be necessary to keep in touch with civilian companies like FedEx in peacetime or when fighting terrorists or insurgents. But in a new era facing off with China or Russia, it is dangerously complacent.
Any 21st century war will include cyber operations. Weapons and support systems will be successfully attacked. ...</span>

                    <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has been delayed twice since its initial unveiling last September, now won&#x27;t arrival until some time next year.
Originally, the Sands of Time remake - which is being developed by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai - was due to launch this January, but the publisher postponed its release to March at the end of last year. When February arrived, however, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the game once more, this time indefinitely, while it worked on delivering &quot;a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original&quot;.
All&#x27;s been quite on the news front since then, but in a new statement posted to Twitter - ostensibly confirming that the remake will be absent from this year&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream - the publisher has shared a revised release window of 2022 for the remake.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a new update for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition - and you&#x27;ll want to have it downloaded smartish if you&#x27;re looking to save your eardrums. 
Yes, those deafening mass relay jumps are now quieter - something many fans had called on BioWare to fix for years.
Mass Effect&#x27;s intergalactic jump points have always been noisy, though the otherwise excellent Legendary Edition has surprised some newer players (or those yet to experience hearing loss) when they find out how loud mass relays are.

The co-op shooter will see a gameplay reveal during the Ubisoft Forward event, which is set for 8pm UK time on 12th June.
The development team at Ubisoft announced the final name for the game in the video below:

                    <span>Royal Games, an online games portal owned by Candy Crush maker King, has come under fire from paying customers who have been unable to cash out their funds. 
The freeze on withdrawals was a consequence of King being investigated by PayPal over how Royal Games operates in specific countries. 
After a lengthy investigation by Eurogamer, the site&#x27;s withdrawal page has now become available again, though the site continues to no longer accept real-world money deposits.

Other Android TV devices will also get Stadia support on the same date - the full list of officially supported screens and devices lies below. 
Even if your telly isn&#x27;t on the list, you can &quot;opt into experimental support&quot; to play Stadia, though &quot;not every Android TV OS device will work pefectly&quot;, Google warns.

                    <span>At the start of the weekend we heard that CD Projekt&#x27;s stolen data was being shared online, and it seems the floodgates are now well and truly open. A bunch of dev-made bug compilation videos are now circulating on social media and file-sharing sites, showing some rarely-seen work-in-progress builds and rather spectacular bugs.  
As Eurogamer reported on Friday, some dev videos had already started to leak alongside the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker, and it appears many of these are now being shared on 4chan, Reddit and YouTube. Most of the videos are being shared using video hosting platform Streamable, but many are now being pulled offline (they are, after all, the result of an illegal ransomware hack). 
Some are short clips showing the player-character being ricocheted into the sky to the sound of Shooting Stars, or being knocked out only to wake up to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim opening. Others are more complex - one compilation shows several bugs with an off-tune recorder version of Spoiler (the track by DJ Hyper used in Cyberpunk&#x27;s 2018 E3 trailer). Another lengthy edit called &quot;CyberElBuggado2020&quot; shows hotdog motorbikes, NPCs T-posing to the sound of Thriller, and Johnny Silverhand saying &quot;this is going to be a disaster&quot; in Spanish.

More than $393k has been raised of a $500k funding target, with the bundle on sale for five more hours. 42,000 people have contributed so far, and you can pay more - or less - if you so choose.
All profit goes to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides food and emergency health protection to those in the region. You can read more about the UNRWA&#x27;s work here.

                    <span>In a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court just narrowed the scope of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act:
In a ruling delivered today, the court sided with Van Buren and overturned his 18-month conviction.
In a 37-page opinion written and delivered by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the court explained that the “exceeds authorized access” language was, indeed, too broad.
Justice Barrett said the clause was effectively making criminals of most US citizens who ever used a work resource to perform unauthorized actions, such as updating a dating profile, checking sports scores, or paying bills at work...</span>

                    <span>The Medium has been rated for PlayStation 5.
Gematsu spotted The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has rated The Medium for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series (presumably that means Xbox Series X and S).
Bloober Team&#x27;s well-received third-person psychological horror game The Medium launched digitally for Xbox Series X and S and PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store in January, as well as via Xbox Game Pass.

                    <span>Sonic creator Yuji Naka has confirmed his exit from Square Enix, and said he may retire.
In a tweet, Naka said he left Square Enix at the end of April. Balan Wonderworld, which Naka directed and Square Enix published on multiple platforms in March, flopped at retail. It sold less than 2100 copies in its opening week in Japan, and failed to make the top 40 in the UK physical chart.
On his departure from Square Enix, Naka said: &quot;I can&#x27;t talk about the reason now, but I hope I can talk about it when the time comes. As for future activities, I&#x27;m 55 years old, so I may retire.&quot;

                    <span>PlayStation 5 exclusive Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart weighs in at a nimble 33GB.
That&#x27;s 33.618GB, to be exact, according to Twitter account @PlaystationSize.
I expected Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart to take up more of my PS5 SSD, so it comes as a welcome surprise to see Insomniac&#x27;s adventure arrive on the smaller side.

                    <span>An artist has alleged Capcom stole her photos in the creation of Resident Evil and Devil May Cry games.
As reported by Polygon, designer Judy A. Juracek filed a lawsuit in a Connecticut court on Friday that alleges Capcom used unlicensed copyrighted photos for the creation of some of its games - and even for the Resident Evil 4 logo.
At the heart of this lawsuit is Juracek&#x27;s book, Surfaces, a visual research for artists, architects and designers that includes 1200 photographs of textures she took herself. Surfaces, which was originally published in 1996, includes a CD-ROM of the images, which require a licence for commercial use.

                    <span>Indie publisher Devolver Digital will host an E3 livestream at 9.30pm UK time on Saturday, 12th June.
It&#x27;s part of Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest.
There&#x27;s no word on what to expect from the show, although I suspect it will follow the same unhinged theme of previous Devolver Digital E3 shows.

                    <span>Shin Megami Tensei 5&#x27;s release date and gameplay details have leaked ahead of an expected appearance at Nintendo Direct during E3.
PersonaCentral.com spotted the Japanese website for the Nintendo Switch exclusive RPG briefly listed an 11th November 2021 release date, alongside story and gameplay information.
This information is expected to be revealed officially during the Nintendo Direct on 15th June, given all previous Shin Megami Tensei 5 information has been announced during Nintendo events. The Shin Megami Tensei 5 trailer released last July is below:

                    <span>Marvelous and Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s cult-hack-and-slash adventures No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle are heading to Steam next Wednesday, 9th June.
First released on Wii in 2007, No More Heroes follows the stylish, frequently ludicrous, and dependably ultra-violent adventures of Travis Touchdown, an ordinary game and anime geek who inadvertently becomes embroiled with the United Assassins Association.
What follows is a third-person hack-and-slash romp, replete with a phenomenal soundtrack, that sees Travis - lightsaber-like beam Katana in hand - murdering his way through the Association&#x27;s top-ranked assassins in order to stay alive. If you&#x27;ve never played the game before, expect geysers of blood, a winningly weird sense of humour, and (rather barren) bike-based open-world interludes in amongst the spirited and largely entertaining action.

                    <span>Following its surprise appearance during a fiscal year financial presentation last week, publisher 505 Games has confirmed that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the acclaimed 2019 Castlevania spiritual successor from Koji Igarashi and developer ArtPlay, is getting a sequel.
Word of a sequel originally surfaced after keen-eyed internet sorts spotted a bullet point inserted into 505 Games&#x27; latest fiscal year financial results, stating a &quot;second version&quot; of  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was in development.
Although the term &quot;second version&quot; left a certain ambiguity as to whether this was referring to a sequel or something else, 505 has now offered clarity in a development update on Reddit. &quot;Regarding recent reports,&quot; it wrote, &quot;[505 Games and Artplay] are in very early planning stages for a Bloodstained sequel&quot;.

                    <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick, which will once again be an online-only event due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, starts in exactly one month&#x27;s time, on 4th July, and in preparation, organisers have shared the full charity speedrun schedule.
2021 marks the second year running that Summer Games Done Quick is going online-only - traditionally, shows have been ticketed real-world events, with all speedrunning showcases being streamed online - and the precautions established last year will remain in place to &quot;ensure the continued safety of our attendees, runners, volunteers, and staff&quot;, according to organisers.
Even without the live-event element, there&#x27;s still plenty to look forward to, with this year&#x27;s show offering a full seven days of speedrunning, from Sunday, 4th July, to 11th July.

                    <span>Earlier this year, CD Projekt confirmed it had been hit by a &quot;targeted cyber attack&quot; that saw its internal systems compromised and sensitive information held to ransom. After CD Projekt said it would not comply with the group&#x27;s demands, the hackers announced that source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent and an unreleased version of The Witcher 3 would be auctioned to the highest bidder, and source code for Gwent was publicly leaked. 
At the time, the hackers claimed they had received a satisfying offer for the information, and the auction was then closed with a condition of &quot;no further distribution&quot; agreed with the buyer. But that stolen data now appears to have resurfaced, with source code, assets and software development kits for platforms including the PlayStation 5 seemingly being shared online. Eurogamer has also seen internal development videos showing work-in-progress builds of Cyberpunk 2077. 
According to security blog DataBreaches.net, earlier this week a threat actor group decided to release CD Projekt&#x27;s information in order to promote its new leaks platform. A note from the hackers was also discovered by security software provider Emsisoft back in March (via IT Pro), and an uncensored version of this was shared on 4chan yesterday (the link provided in the note no longer works, but the data is now being shared elsewhere). The note claims the release of the stolen information is part of a &quot;charity fundraising&quot; effort - although as the group is asking for payment in cryptocurrency, there&#x27;s no way to guarantee that&#x27;s actually going to a good cause.

Its parent company Koch Media plans a livestream with new announcements for Summer Games Fest, but Deep Silver&#x27;s games will not be a part of it, or any other E3 2021 event.
&quot;We&#x27;ll let you know when we have news to share,&quot; the Deep Silver Twitter account said.

                    <span>New Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players now need to pay for ranked play, Valve has announced.
Previously, new players of the free-to-play competitive first-person shooter had access to drops, ranks, skill groups, and a free path to Prime (paid) matchmaking.
Valve said that over time, these benefits had become &quot;an incentive for bad actors to hurt the experience of both new and existing players&quot;.

                    <span>The developer of Injustice 2 Mobile has apologised for a Pride event that challenged players to beat up a queer woman.
The mobile version of NetherRealm&#x27;s fighting game was accused of being &quot;tone deaf&quot; after an in-game challenge designed to celebrate Pride Month tasked players with defeating canonically bisexual character Poison Ivy hundreds of thousands of times.
Rewards for completing the community challenge included Harley Quinn tokens - a nod to Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn&#x27;s romantic relationship in DC Comics.

The leak first appeared on reddit and was subsequently verified by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier.
As you&#x27;d expect, NBA 2K22 is on the cards. According to the leak, ex-NBA pro Dirk Nowitzki is one of the cover stars.

SHB is a small, annual, invitational workshop of people studying various aspects of the human side of security, organized each year by Alessandro Acquisti, Ross Anderson, and myself. The forty or so attendees include psychologists, economists, computer security researchers, sociologists, political scientists, criminologists, neuroscientists, designers, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, business school professors, and a smattering of others.

                    <span>Sony has once again turned its attention to virtual reality of the PlayStation kind, with another of its PSVR showcases - and if you missed its various announcements, you can catch up below.
First up, Sniper Elite VR - unsurprisingly a virtual reality spin on developer Rebellion&#x27;s long-range FPS series - will be launching on 8th July. The studio is promising a &quot;powerful World War 2 story&quot; told through the eyes of an Italian Partisan, said to deliver a &quot;new perspective&quot; on the franchise&#x27;s acclaimed stealth and sniping action.
Next up is a reveal for new game Wanderer, created by M Theory and Oddboy. This one&#x27;s an immersive time travel adventure - melding narrative-driven exploration, puzzling, and mini-games - in which you&#x27;re able to embody some of history&#x27;s most famous explorers, inventors, and conquerors as you hop back and forth between ancient civilisations, war time, the hippie-hued 60s, even the far flung, post-apocalyptic future. Wanderer is due to arrive this summer.

                    <span>Rust is infamous for having a pretty hostile player base - something I learned the hard way when I first started playing - but a change arriving this month could make it easier to avoid your worst neighbours. A new &quot;contact system&quot; is being rolled out as part of Rust&#x27;s June update, and it will highlight those who have done bad things to you. 
&quot;Upon meeting a new player they&#x27;ll be logged into your contacts and the contact system will now keep a history of all interactions (good, bad, indifferent, rage-inducing etc),&quot; Facepunch explained in a press release. &quot;To help quickly identify friend from foe, players&#x27; nameplates will now display blue for friendly and red for hostile. Waving at players will reveal your name (it doesn&#x27;t always pay to be nice...) and using binoculars will reveal if a player is unknown, hostile or friendly from large distances.&quot;
On the surface, it sounds similar to the way hostile players are marked in Red Dead Online with a red dot or star depending on their recent actions. With Rust, however, it seems like it will be up to the individual to categorise other players: you can designate someone as an enemy, for instance, and make notes on each player you meet. Seems like a handy way to keep track of all those nakeds.

                    <span>Frontier has released a second major update for space sim Elite Dangerous&#x27; poorly received Odyssey expansion, bringing a raft of much-needed improvements, ranging from UI enhancements and graphics optimisations to AI tweaks and many, many bug fixes.
Odyssey, which finally gives players the much-requested ability to step outside their ships and stroll around the galaxy in first-person, was lambasted by players when it launched last month, quickly accruing a &#x27;Mostly Negative&#x27; rating on Steam as purchasers highlighted performance issues, server outages, and a heap of bugs - despite Frontier having held a month-long paid alpha prior to launch, ostensibly to fix any glaring problems ahead of release.
As the negative reviews continued, Frontier Developments boss David Braben stepped in, releasing a statement apologising &quot;to those who have been suffering from these problems&quot; and insisting that addressing Odyssey&#x27;s myriad reported issues was the studio&#x27;s &quot;priority and focus.&quot;

Creative Assembly didn&#x27;t stop there. The UK developer announced Skarbrand as a Legendary Lord for Khorne in the upcoming Total War: Warhammer 3.

The DLC, due out in July, reworks the Beastmen race &quot;to more closely match their intended playstyle and address their previous issues with horde gameplay&quot;, Creative Assembly said.
&quot;With a big focus on progression the Beastmen have a much more engaging and lasting experience.&quot;

                    <span>Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate is coming back with a new game nearly 25 years after the last one.

Frontier is publishing Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters under its Frontier Foundry games label. The game itself is developed by Canadian studio Complex Games, which has previously focused on mobile games such as The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault.

                    <span>Ubisoft has said its E3 show will feature Rainbow Six Quarantine, Far Cry 6, Riders Republic &quot;and some surprises that you won&#x27;t want to miss&quot;.
Ubisoft Forward, which is set for 8pm UK time on 12th June, will showcast the game formerly known as Rainbow Six Quarantine. 
Over an hour of gameplay from Rainbow Six Quarantine leaked from a technical test in March. (Then, the game was referred to as its codename: Rainbow Six: Parasite.) Ubisoft said the Quarantine name will change as a result of the ongoing pandemic.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been casting a curious eye at developer 11 Bit Studios&#x27; celebrated post-apocalyptic city builder Frostpunk but have yet to experience its brutal survival charms, now&#x27;s the perfect time to do so, as it&#x27;s currently free on the Epic Games Store.
Frostpunk, which launched to much acclaim in 2018, is a fascinating, if decidedly gruelling, experience. It&#x27;s a sort of narrative-rich blend of survival sim and city builder, challenging players to stay alive and, as much as is possible in Frostpunk&#x27;s desolate sub-zero world, thrive.
That&#x27;s done by establishing a settlement with a vast generator at its centre, a precariously fuel-hungry device intended to provide some degree of warmth for your population as, at your command, they set about scavenging the land for supplies needed to expand their new home.

                    <span>Crowfall, a player versus player MMO you can win and lose, finally has a release date: 6th July. And you can gain immediate access to it now by signing up for the beta.
It&#x27;s an MMO I&#x27;ve been following since it Kickstarted in 2015 (after which it raised more money via player investment and in-game property sales), and one I&#x27;ve played a bit of recently. It&#x27;s a slightly tricky one to explain.
In general, it&#x27;s an online fantasy game about fighting other players. That is the point. There&#x27;s a bit of monster fighting, but only really to serve as a tutorial while you quickly level up. There&#x27;s a level-cap of 30 which you can get quite close to in a few hours if you&#x27;re speedy.

                    <span>With just a week to go until the still-rather-nebulous E3 2021, its organiser the ESA has issued a rough guide on what to expect via its livestreams each day.
Alongside concrete press conference details already announced separately by certain companies (Microsoft, Ubisoft, Nintendo), there are mentions of various publisher presentations which will slot into E3 2021 programming.
Hopefully we&#x27;ll get a clearer timeframe for everything over the next week.

                    <span>Over the past few months, Apex Legends players have increasingly reported problems with DDoS attacks in their games: one moment they&#x27;ve been sliding their way around World&#x27;s Edge, the next, their game has frozen and they&#x27;ve been booted out. It&#x27;s become a particular issue in Ranked games, where miscreants have used DDoS attacks to artificially boost themselves up the leaderboards. Hoovering up a bunch of disconnected opponents is easier than actually playing the game, after all. 
Respawn has already indicated it&#x27;s taking the situation seriously - banning some behind high-profile cases, and mentioning that it&#x27;s even considering legal action against those carrying out the attacks. But it seems progress is being made towards a more permanent solution, with security analyst Conor &quot;Hideouts&quot; Ford explaining on Twitter that significant progress has been made on a fix. 
&quot;The DDoS situation is being addressed as we speak by our very own @ricklesauceur [lead software engineer Samy Duc],&quot; Ford said. &quot;It isn&#x27;t the easiest fix in the world but huge steps are being made to take care of this.&quot;

                    <span>Lego will hold its first ever announcement livestream, Lego Con, on 26th June at 5pm UK time.
Expect Lego set reveals for video game franchises such as Minecraft and Super Mario, as well as other top-selling ranges like Harry Potter, Technic, Star Wars and Dots. 
We already know Lego Super Luigi will launch on 1st August, so we&#x27;re likely to see what&#x27;s next for the range - and presumably the next vast wave of accompanying bits and pieces due alongside Mario&#x27;s brother. Birdo please.

Days Gone - which initially launched on PS4 before making it way to PC earlier this year - was the studio&#x27;s first crack at a new IP since its acquisition by Sony in 2000; prior to that game, the developer was largely known for adapting the likes of Uncharted and Resistance for Sony&#x27;s handheld consoles, the PSP and Vita.
Announcing its next project in a statement on Twitter,  Bend wrote, &quot;We are beyond grateful for your support with Days Gone and are truly honoured by the amount of passion our community has shared with us for our world and characters. Your enthusiasm motivates us to continue to improve and create experiences that will last a lifetime.&quot;

                    <span>God of War: Ragnarok, which was originally announced for a PlayStation 5 release in 2021, has been delayed into next year, and will now also launch on PS4 .
Confirming the news on Twitter, developer Sony Santa Monica Studio explained it had made the decision to push God of War: Ragnarok&#x27;s release back into 2022 in order to maintain the &quot;safety and wellbeing&quot; of its team.
&quot;Since the release of the next God of War teaser last year,&quot; the full statement reads, &quot;we&#x27;ve been humbled by the amount of love our community has show us. We&#x27;re incredibly grateful so see so many people excited to experience the next chapter of Kratos and Atreus&#x27; journey&quot;.

                    <span>Nintendo will hold its big E3 Nintendo Direct on 15th June at 5pm UK time. 
The showcase will run for 40 minutes and focus &quot;exclusively on Nintendo Switch software&quot;, the company said, nodding to the rampant reports of an imminent Switch hardware reveal. 
Of course, we&#x27;re expecting that Nintendo Switch hardware reveal before E3 itself, paving the way for Nintendo and other developers to focus specifically on games during E3.

                    <span>Riot has announced Valorant Mobile.
The mobile version of the currently PC-only free-to-play competitive first-person shooter, which now has more than 14 million players each month, is in the works, but Riot did not say when it will come out, or reveal any images or gameplay.
Valorant launched on PC a year ago, on 2nd June 2020. Riot said it&#x27;s working on expanding the franchise, starting with Valorant Mobile, &quot;in order to bring Valorant to more players around the world.&quot;

                    <span>Hello Games&#x27; ceaselessly evolving exploratory space sim No Man&#x27;s Sky has just received another free update on all platforms; it&#x27;s called Prisms, and brings sweeping visual enhancements to the already striking sci-fi sandbox.
Prisms, No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s 17th named update since its release back in 2016, touches up the game&#x27;s visual presentation pretty much across the board. Planets, for instance, get enhanced weather effects - Hello Games highlights rain, which now refracts the light and causes surfaces to become slick and wet - while underground caves become more detailed, with improved lighting and volumetric fog.
Planetary fauna, meanwhile, has been overhauled with proper fur effects and, as a bonus, flying creatures - which were sadly neglected in No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s taming-based Companions update - can now be adopted and ridden through the sky.

Writing on the Mass Effect reddit, former BioWare designer Richard Boisvert explained the Easter egg was his creation, and there was a specific path players had to follow in order to see it properly. 
&quot;As far as I know no one ever stumbled upon it,&quot; Boisvert wrote.

The message had sat in the code of the original Java Minecraft for over a decade, added by long-departed creator Markus &quot;Notch&quot; Persson. It was never featured in the newer Bedrock version of the game available on consoles, mobiles and Windows.

                    <span>Biomutant developer Experiment 101 has, as promised, released an update for the game that makes significant changes.
Chief among them is the ability to shut the annoying narrator up. Biomutant&#x27;s incorporeal narrator is certainly pretty chatty, commenting on pretty much everything you do and translating everything anyone says. Prior to the release of this patch, while you were able to tone the narrator down, you couldn&#x27;t shut him up completely. Now you can.
Here are the relevant patch notes:

Renovations on the building are now underway to transform the factory into a &quot;Nintendo Gallery&quot; where products from throughout the company&#x27;s history will be showcased, alongside exhibits and other experiences (thanks, Nintendo Life).
The site was formerly Nintendo&#x27;s Uji Oguru Plant, a facility originally built in 1969 to print Hanafuda cards, before it became a customer service centre for product repairs.

The cut footage was found back in 2019 via an old VHS tape, but was in poor quality. Since then, a group has worked on restoring the long-lost version, which is now available to watch in full via the Internet Archive.
As officially released, Super Mario Bros. was 104 minutes. This new version - dubbed the Morton Jankel Cut in honour of its husband and wife director team - runs 125 minutes, with most scenes extended.

In a message to fans, producer Yasuyuki Oda said the ongoing struggle with coronavirus in Japan had set development back.
&quot;The development timeline we set out to reach in the beginning has been affected by the ever-still rising cases of COVID-19 within Japan,&quot; Oda said.

A glimpse into DarkSide’s secret communications in the months leading up to the Colonial Pipeline attack reveals a criminal operation on the rise, pulling in millions of dollars in ransom payments each month.
DarkSide offers what is known as “ransomware as a service,” in which a malware developer charges a user fee to so-called affiliates like Woris, who may not have the technical skills to actually create ransomware but are still capable of breaking into a victim’s computer systems...</span>

                    <span>Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis, the standalone-expansion-style next instalment in Sega&#x27;s long-running free-to-play online action-RPG series, will - following its beta last month - be making its way to Xbox and PC next Wednesday, 9th June.
Announced last summer, New Genesis is described as the &quot;next-generation&quot; of Phantasy Star Online 2, and catapults the action forward 1,000 years after the Oracle&#x27;s battle in PSO2.
Bundled alongside the base game, it includes a new graphics engine, enhanced character models, a new multi-weapon system, and, most notably, a &quot;wide-open battlefield&quot; with changing time and weather, traversable using new abilities like the Photon Dash and Photon Glide. There&#x27;s also cross-platform play, plus fully localised text and character voices in English.

                    <span>All three episodes of Life is Strange developer Dontnod&#x27;s well-received supernatural mystery adventure Tell Me Why are currently free on PC and Xbox.
Tell Me Why, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tells the story of twins Tyler and Alyson as they reunite, after several years apart, to sell their childhood home in the picturesque Alaskan town of Delos Crossing - a task that ultimately forces them to confront their traumatic past.
What follows is a deft blend of supernatural mystery thriller and earnest, character-driven homecoming drama - there&#x27;s real beauty and warmth in the relationship between its twin protagonists - that&#x27;s arguably Dontnod&#x27;s most assured, consistently enjoyable outing yet, even if its perhaps not quite as devastatingly memorable as its Life is Strange forebears.

&quot;However, when Alba finds out about plans to build a garish hotel on the site of the island&#x27;s nature reserve,&quot; explains UsTwo, &quot;she sets out to stop it!&quot;

                    <span>Two Point Campus, a comedic university sim, is the next project from Two Point Hospital developer Two Point Studios.
That&#x27;s according to a Microsoft Store listing for the game which popped up online yesterday (thanks, VG247), and which has now been taken offline. 
Screenshots show normal university activities such as jousting and giant pizza cooking, as well as university buildings themed around Hogwarts-style castles and European city squares.

Humble launched the Heal COVID-19 Bundle a couple of weeks back to support a number of charities aiding the hardest-hit countries such as Brazil and India, as well as the global medical effort to save lives. It&#x27;s gone on to sell 54,374 bundles and raise aid for the humanitarian efforts of Direct Relief, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), International Medical Corps, and GiveIndia.
&quot;Direct Relief is tremendously grateful to Humble Bundle and its community of passionate and generous people,&quot; Direct Relief said in a statement on the official website (thanks, The Gamer). &quot;Their collective efforts will translate to critically-needed medicines, supplies, and other resources to the hardest-hit communities in India and Brazil as they continue to battle rising cases of COVID-19.

                    <span>A cancelled Fallout 2 sequel by Black Isle studios is now available to play in Fallout New Vegas courtesy of a new PC mod.
The game - which at the time had been codenamed Van Buren - takes place in 2253 and had been set in the great Midwest Commonwealth over four states. Sadly, it was cancelled in 2003, and while New Vegas inherited some aspects from the game, the Revelation Blue mod doesn&#x27;t &quot;treat [Fallout: New Vegas] as cannon [sic] in any way&quot;.
&quot;The project&#x27;s goal is to remake Van Buren for Fallout New Vegas,&quot; explains the mod creator (thanks, PC Gamer).

                    <span>PlayStation 5 exclusive Destruction AllStars will get online bots.
In an update on the Destruction AllStars subreddit, developer Lucid outlined features due out for the action driving game. Chief among them is the addition of online bots.
Lucid acknowledged that the size of Destruction AllStars&#x27; community, spread out as it is across the world, means the game has peak times and low times of player activity for online matchmaking. The peaks tend to be around 5pm to 11pm UK time during weekdays, and 3pm to 2am UK time on the weekend.

The recently-released sci-fi survival battle royale hybrid has an experimental sandbox testing platform built into the game called ScavLab, and it&#x27;s in this that the test will take place tonight, from 7pm UK time.
This first public ScavLab event will allow thousands of players to gather together in a single, shared in-game communal hub. Developer Midwinter plans competitive sports mini-games, large-scale combat, as well as a live, digital AMA with CEO and co-founder Josh Holmes.

                    <span>Benoît Sokal, creator of the Syberia series, has died aged 66.
French video game company Microids said in a blog post that Sokal passed away on 28th May after battling a long-term illness.
Belgian comic book artist Sokal is perhaps best known in the world of video games for creating the Syberia adventure games. But his first game for Microids was 1999 adventure Amerzone, which was based on Sokal&#x27;s popular 1986 Inspector Canardo comic strip L&#x27;Amerzone .

                    <span>Creative Assembly is facing a vociferous backlash over its decision to end support for Total War: Three Kingdoms.
This week the British developer announced it had wrapped up work on Total War: Three Kingdoms with the 1.7.1 patch. No more DLC or patches will be released for the game, which broke series records upon launch in May 2019.
Total War: Three Kingdoms saw seven DLC releases over the course of two years, but many fans feel Creative Assembly quit the game too early - and before the release of a promised expansion that would build out the north of the map.

                    <span>Grounded will get &quot;larger and slightly less frequent&quot; updates from now on, developer Obsidian has said.
After a period of radio silence, the developer issued an update on its survival game, which launched in early access form in July last year.
&quot;We are approaching the one-year mark from the game preview / early access launch and we still have so much that we want to do for the game,&quot; Obsidian said.

                    <span>A new Microsoft Flight Simulator patch has reduced the game&#x27;s initial full download from over 170GB to 83GB.
In the patch notes for Sim Update 4, aka patch 1.16.20.0, the development team said it had performed optimisations for the initial full download of Microsoft Flight Simulator so the base game is 83GB instead of over 170GB.
It&#x27;s good news to see the game&#x27;s download halved, although 83GB is still a chunky old effort.
