                    <span>We have discovered a squid — (Oegopsida, Magnapinnidae, Magnapinna sp.) — that lives at 6,000 meters deep.
:They’re really weird,” says Vecchione. “They drift along with their arms spread out and these really long, skinny, spaghetti-like extensions dangling down underneath them.” Microscopic suckers on those filaments enable the squid to capture their prey.
But the squid that Jamieson and Vecchione saw in the footage captured 6,212 meters below the ocean’s surface is a small one. They estimate that its mantle measured 10 centimeters long — ­about a third the size of the largest-known magnapinnid. And the characteristically long extensions observed on other magnapinnids were nowhere to be seen in the video. That could mean, says Vecchione, that this bigfin squid was a juvenile...</span>

                    <span>This development suprises no one who has been paying attention:
Researchers now believe AirTags, which are equipped with Bluetooth technology, could be revealing a more widespread problem of tech-enabled tracking. They emit a digital signal that can be detected by devices running Apple’s mobile operating system. Those devices then report where an AirTag has last been seen. Unlike similar tracking products from competitors such as Tile, Apple added features to prevent abuse, including notifications like the one Ms. Estrada received and automatic beeping.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO)
is an out-of-tree Kubernetes enhancement to make the management of
seccomp,
SELinux and
AppArmor profiles easier and more
convenient. We&#x27;re happy to announce that we recently released
v0.4.0
of the operator, which contains a ton of new features, fixes and usability
improvements.
What&#x27;s new
It has been a while since the last
v0.3.0
release of the operator. We added new features, fine-tuned existing ones and
reworked our documentation in 290 commits over the past half year.
One of the highlights is that we&#x27;re now able to record seccomp and SELinux
profiles using the operators log enricher.
This allows us to reduce the dependencies required for profile recording to have

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been enjoying your time sleuthing around the sunny, Mediterranean-inspired climes of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, you might be interested to know that developer Frogwares has just released a brand-new case to crack in the form of its Beyond a Joke DLC.
Beyond a Joke, which is out now on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5, serves up a new quest - the first of &quot;three major bonus story content additions&quot;, as Frogwares puts it - in which young Sherlock Holmes and his chiselled jawline go on the hunt for an &quot;unstoppable&quot; thief targeting the island of Cordona&#x27;s ultra-rich &quot;with brazen gusto and open mockery&quot;.

                    <span>Actor Ernie Hudson, perhaps better known as Ghostbusters&#x27; Winston Zeddemore, has claimed a new video game based on the legendary movie series is &quot;definitely happening&quot;.
This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve heard word of a new Ghostbusters game, of course; back in October, Raphael Saadiq, the co-founder of Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunter Grounds developer Illfonic, let slip that the studio was currently working on the title. Unsurprisingly though, given that the game is still yet to be officially announced, Saadiq hasn&#x27;t offered any update since, leaving movie fans uncertain of the project&#x27;s status.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot going on in the world of Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock today; not only has the studio announced it&#x27;s been acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, it&#x27;s also just released the first big post-launch content update for its well-received co-op zombie shooter. The latter brings with it a range of tweaks and additions, the most notable of which is a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression.
First the acquisition news; as of today, following Tencent&#x27;s purchase of Turtle Rock&#x27;s parent company Slamfire, the studio is now wholly owned by the Chinese conglomerate. According to the announcement, Turtle Rock will continue to operate independently at its Lake Forest, California, offices, with co-founders Phil Robb and Chris Ashton remaining at the helm.

                    <span>This seems big:
The UK government has officially included decapod crustaceans–including crabs, lobsters, and crayfish–and cephalopod mollusks–including octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish–in its Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill. This means they are now recognized as “sentient beings” in the UK.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>Author: Matthew Cary (Google)
Kubernetes v1.23 introduced a new, alpha-level policy for
StatefulSets that controls the lifetime of
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) generated from the
StatefulSet spec template for cases when they should be deleted automatically when the StatefulSet
is deleted or pods in the StatefulSet are scaled down.
What problem does this solve?
A StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the
Kubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior
before Kubernetes v1.23 was that the control plane never cleaned up the PVCs created for
StatefulSets - this was left up to the cluster administrator, or to some add-on automation that
you’d have to find, check suitability, and deploy. The commo…</span>

                    <span>Minecraft, you probably don&#x27;t need telling, is popular; it&#x27;s sold over 238M copies since its launch in 2009 making it the best-selling game of all time, it claims over 140M monthly active users, and was enticing enough for Microsoft to spend an eye-watering $2.5 billion USD acquiring its developer Mojang back in 2014. And now here&#x27;s another massive figure for the record books: it&#x27;s officially the first game to surpass one trillion views on YouTube.
To celebrate the immense milestone, YouTube has launched a new website highlighting the creators and videos that helped Minecraft reach 1,000,000,000,000 views over the last decade - a figure that would, as YouTube points out to put it into some kind of perspective, amount to over 30,000 years if each view equated to just one second of time.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting news of the next instalment in the nearly three-decade-old Settlers series, your patience will soon be awarded: publisher Ubisoft has announced it&#x27;ll be revealing more information on the long-delayed game in January next year.
Ubisoft first revealed it would be revisiting the Settlers&#x27; much-loved city-building and real-time strategy formula in a new series instalment back in 2018. At the time, it told fans to expect the title in autumn the following year but, as that window grew near, the publisher announced a delay, pushing the game&#x27;s release into 2020.

The Queen and the Sea, which follows previous paid expansions The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls, brings a touch of the nautical to Dead Cells&#x27; acclaimed action, introducing new enemies, bosses, weapons, and two brand-new biomes - Infested Shipwreck and the Lighthouse - that&#x27;ll run parallel to the existing High Peak Castle and Throne Room late-game stages.

                    <span>Red Candle Games, the developer behind critically acclaimed horror outings Detention and Devotion, has - following a bit of an animated tease earlier this year - formally announced its latest title, an action-platformer loosely inspired by From Software&#x27;s superb Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice that&#x27;s currently going by the name of Nine Sols.
Details are extremely limited right now, but Red Candle describes Nine Sols (a working title at present) as a &quot;lore rich hand-drawn 2D platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat&quot;. The developer has also shared a wonderfully evocative bit of promo art that - while a significant aesthetic departure from its previous games - does suggest, with its mangled limbs and pools of blood, that we&#x27;re not exactly in family friendly territory here.

                    <span>Tis the season of festive sales in video game land, and the Epic Games Store has now thrown open its shutters and bellowed news of its own discount offerings into the cold winter night, which includes the return of its daily &quot;mystery gift&quot; free games, starting with Shenmue 3.
Shenmue 3 is, of course, the long, long, long-awaited third instalment in developer Yu Suzuki&#x27;s classic action-adventure series, which finally arrived in 2019 following a gap of 18 years between it and its predecessor. Picking up where Shenmue 2 left off, part 3 sees protagonist Ryo Hazuki resume his quest for vengeance after the murder of his father in the original, delivering a new chapter that Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robison called both &quot;archaic and arcane&quot; and &quot;a worthy successor to what many consider an all-time great&quot; in his review.

PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) are
associated with Reclaim Policy.
The Reclaim Policy is used to determine the actions that need to be taken by the storage

As with Mullins&#x27; previous creations, Inscryption - a dizzyingly strange blend of deck-building rogue-like, escape-room puzzler, and psychological horror - loves to surprise, which inevitably means some deviation away from its opening portion, a engaging combination of sharply designed card battling and Slay-the-Spire-style map progression.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re in the market for a thoroughly delightful distraction to help occupy those cold winter nights over the festive period (and who wouldn&#x27;t be?), you might like to point your face in the direction of Ubisoft Connect, where the excellent Rayman Oranges is currently free on PC.
It&#x27;s yet another offering in Ubisoft&#x27;s 35th anniversary celebrations, which have previously seen the publisher tucking into its pockets of yore and slinging the likes of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed Chronicles trilogy, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, and Anno 1404: History Edition at PC players.

                    <span>As part of its fascinating Power On documentary series released to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Xbox, Microsoft has discussed the time it rejected Rockstar&#x27;s pitch to put Grand Theft Auto 3 on the original Xbox back in 2001 - a decision that would ultimately lead to the multi-million-selling phenomenon being snapped up by Sony as a timed exclusive.
The story, which follows similarly candid recollections from Microsoft in Power On - including the admission its closure of Fable developer Lionhead Studios was one of the company&#x27;s &quot;biggest missteps&quot; - comes in the third episode. Here, various members of the original Xbox team discuss Microsoft&#x27;s preparations for the console&#x27;s launch, which saw the group going on a &quot;barnstorming tour&quot; across America, Europe, and Japan to build excitement and convince developers its machine could be a success.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re curious about PlayStation Plus but haven&#x27;t yet become a member - or have no intention of ever becoming a member, but have a sudden urge to play some online multiplayer games all the same - Sony is giving players two days to trial the subscription service this weekend.
PlayStation Plus, should you be unfamiliar, is required to play the vast majority of PlayStation 4 and PS5 multiplayer games online (although free-to-play titles such as Fortnite are excluded), and, as an extra incentive to subscribe, offers a monthly selection of games to add to your library for the duration of a membership at no extra cost.

                    <span>If been wondering where Nightdive Studios&#x27; long-in-the-works System Shock remake has got to - given that it&#x27;s previously announced &quot;late summer&quot; 2021 release window has very much been and gone - the developer says the project is now due to arrive some time next year. It&#x27;ll be published by Koch Media&#x27;s Prime Matter division and there are a selection of new screenshots to tide people over until more solid release date news comes their way.
It has, of course, been a long and eventful road for the System Shock remake, which was originally intended to be a remaster of Looking Glass Technologies&#x27; cult-classic 1994 sci-fi horror before ballooning in scope. By the time its Kickstarter commenced in July 2016, Nightdive was calling it a &quot;reboot&quot; and, after a rocky period of development, the studio announced it was putting the project on hiatus after letting &quot;things get out of control&quot;.

                    <span>It’s serious:
The range of impacts is so broad because of the nature of the vulnerability itself. Developers use logging frameworks to keep track of what happens in a given application. To exploit Log4Shell, an attacker only needs to get the system to log a strategically crafted string of code. From there they can load arbitrary code on the targeted server and install malware or launch other attacks. Notably, hackers can introduce the snippet in seemingly benign ways, like by sending the string in an email or setting it as an account username...</span>

As reported by IGN, in the sixth part of Power On: The Story of Xbox - a six-part documentary detailing Microsoft&#x27;s highs and lows across its Xbox brand - key figures talked about the acquisition and eventual closure of one of the UK&#x27;s biggest studios in a bid to &quot;not repeat&quot; the &quot;same mistakes&quot;.

Acknowledging players may be frustrated that there&#x27;s currently no way they can go back to enjoy and replay story missions, Crocker explained that pivoting to &quot;nonlinear&quot; gameplay makes replaying the campaign &quot;incredibly challenging&quot;, but level select is &quot;being worked on&quot;.

Ubisoft announced Valhalla would be receiving a second year of updates back in June, confirming several new expansions were on the way, starting in 2022. The publisher is yet to share specifics but clues spotted in Valhalla&#x27;s Trophy list have suggested the first will be titled Dawn of Ragnarök.

Yes, that version includes both the photo mode and the Intergrade expansion that&#x27;s currently only available on PlayStation 5 (thanks, PC Gamer), but it&#x27;s the &quot;standard&quot; edition of a game - that is, a base version without a season pass, cosmetic items, or DLC etc. - and one of the first PC games to be sold at &quot;next-gen&quot; console prices.

The Kubernetes in-tree storage plugin to Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration infrastructure has already been beta since v1.17. CSI migration was introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.14.
Since then, SIG Storage and other Kubernetes special interest groups are working to ensure feature stability and compatibility in preparation for GA.
This article is intended to give a status update to the feature as well as changes between Kubernetes 1.17 and 1.23. In addition, I will also cover the future roadmap for the CSI migration feature GA for each storage plugin.
Quick recap: What is CSI Migration, and why migrate?
The Container Storage Interface (CSI) was designed to help Kubernetes replace its existing, in-tree storage driver mechanisms - especially vendor spe…</span>

                    <span>Following its blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss it debut during this year&#x27;s Game Awards, developer Rebellion has officially revealed Sniper Elite 5, which will be making its way to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC some time next year.

All that comes with a shift in location, with Sniper Elite 5&#x27;s WW2 yarn taking the series away from Italy circa 1943, as seen in the previous game, to the France of 1944.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard has emailed staff arguing that &quot;active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees&quot; is better than unionisation as ongoing strike action heads into its fifth day.
Last month, Activision Blizzard was the focus of a damning Wall Street Journal report detailing further alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - further shining an unflattering spotlight on an organisation already facing widespread condemnation following the launch of a California state lawsuit in July calling it a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.

                    <span>Frontier Developments has offered Elite Dangerous players with access to the game&#x27;s troubled Odyssey expansion a bit of an early Christmas present, finally introducing a new ground vehicle option - the two-seater Scorpion SRV - for the first time in six years.
Elite Dangerous&#x27; first SRV (that&#x27;s Surface Recon Vehicle, in case you were wondering) arrived as part of the game&#x27;s Horizons expansion back in 2015. Horizons added the ability to land on planets, and that first SRV, the single-seater Scarab - released long before the Odyssey expansion introduced on-foot traversal - was an integral part of the puzzle, giving players the ability to travel outside their ships.

                    <span>PUBG: Battlegrounds is going free-to-play on 12th January on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, publisher Krafton announced tonight at The Game Awards. 
The long-lived battle royale originally launched in 2017 and is still popular - but it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how much of a further boost this gives the game.

Slitterhead is the work of Toyama&#x27;s new studio, Bokeh, which he founded after departing SCE Japan Studio at the tail-end of last year.

                    <span>It&#x27;s an announcement fans have been eagerly anticipating for more than a decade now, but Alan Wake 2 is finally official - and will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and the Epic Games Store in 2023.
It&#x27;s certainly welcome news if not particularly surprising; after all, developer Remedy has spent the last few years doing its best to bring Alan Wake back into the public conscience - first in a fairly substantial cameo in the studio&#x27;s acclaimed supernatural shooter Control, and then in a refreshed remaster for the 2010 original earlier this year.

 Wonder Woman will apparently be a single-player open world action game &quot;powered by Nemesis system&quot;. A stylish teaser was shown focusing on Wonder Woman&#x27;s iconic costume. No gameplay yet or platforms, and no hint of a date.

It was, of course, a not-so-thinly veiled nod at the current and very much ongoing situation at Activision Blizzard, which Keighley had been called out on whether he would acknowledge.

                    <span>Capcom&#x27;s brilliant Monster Hunter Rise is, very excitingly given how good the base game is, set to get a &quot;massive&quot; paid expansion next summer in the form of Sunbreak, and we&#x27;ve now been given a fresh look at its action - and new monster Lunagaron - in a new teaser trailer.
We initially got a taste of Sunbreak&#x27;s moody new climes in September, when Capcom brought first news of the expansion. However, as part of this year&#x27;s Game Awards, the publisher has traded pre-rendered cinematics for what appears to be in-engine footage. Granted, we&#x27;re still talking cut-scenes here, but it&#x27;s nice to get a more tangible look at the game as its release drawers slowly nearer.

I don’t see a lot of surprises in the document. Lots of apps leak all sorts of metadata: iMessage and WhatsApp seem to be the worst. Signal protects the most metadata. End-to-end encrypted message content can be available if the user uploads it to an unencrypted backup server.</span>

With the release of Kubernetes v1.23, Pod Security admission has now entered beta. Pod Security is a built-in admission controller that evaluates pod specifications against a predefined set of Pod Security Standards and determines whether to admit or deny the pod from running.
Pod Security is the successor to PodSecurityPolicy which was deprecated in the v1.21 release, and will be removed in Kubernetes v1.25. In this article, we cover the key concepts of Pod Security along with how to use it. We hope that cluster administrators and developers alike will use this new mechanism to enforce secure defaults for their workloads.
Why Pod Security
The overall aim of Pod Security is to let you isolate workloads. You can run a cluster that run…</span>

                    <span>Blasphemous, developer The Game Kitchen&#x27;s superb gothic action-platformer, has reached the end of its current adventure, wrapping things up with a final free expansion, Wounds of Eventide, that&#x27;s available now on all platforms.
Blasphemous, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, released to well-deserved acclaim back in 2019, sending players on a decidedly dark quest - a punishing, but deeply rewarding blend of 2D Souls-like and Metroidvania - that told the story of The Penitent One, a pointy hatted fellow with a barbed-wire sword, forced to venture across the accursed kingdom of Cvstodia.

                    <span>Gears of War&#x27;s Marcus Fenix and Kait Diaz are the latest characters to be uprooted from their usual homes and shoved into the metaversal nightmare that is Fortnite, with both arriving in the free-to-play battle royale game later today.
It&#x27;s not entirely clear what the occasion is - although a quick Google tells me Gears of War is currently celebrating its 15 year, one month, and two day anniversary, so perhaps that&#x27;s a thing - but Fenix and Diaz will both be available as paid skins in the Fortnite store from 7pm ET this evening, which equates to 12am, 10th December in the UK.

                    <span>Thursday is here, meaning a fresh batch of free games to download and keep courtesy of the Epic Games Store, which this week look an awful lot like Prison Architect and Godfall: Challenger Edition. And if that&#x27;s somehow not enough to be getting on with, leaks are suggesting Epic will have plenty more freebies to give away over the festive period.
First up though, this week&#x27;s offerings, beginning with developer Counterplay Games&#x27; Godfall: Challenger Edition. If that name sounds familiar, it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s the same title currently being given away, somewhat controversially, as part of PlayStation Plus.

                    <span>Kickstarter plans to move its crowdfunding platform to blockchain.
In a blog post, the company detailed plans to develop a &quot;decentralised crowdfunding protocol&quot; so people can &quot;launch and fund creative projects anywhere&quot; across the web.

                    <span>CD Projekt is holding settlement talks with investors unhappy over last year&#x27;s disastrous Cyberpunk 2077 launch. 
After years of hype and flashy trailers, Cyberpunk 2077 arrived in a broken and buggy state on consoles, particularly on last-gen machines. The game was temporarily withdrawn from sale on PlayStation and, a year on, its next-gen update is still to materialise.

                    <span>DICE has released its final update this year for Battlefield 2042 (barring any critical issues), aimed at mopping up the last of the major gameplay problems which have marred the game since launch. 
The key changes include improvements to hit registration consistency, the addition of a toggle to disable cross-play for Xbox Series X/S players, and fixing a rare bug where a player would be invisible to other players (which was quite handy if you wanted to earn the melee achievement).

High-profile attorney Lisa Bloom spoke at a press conference outside Activision Blizzard headquarters representing an employee named Christine, who has said she was subjected to abuse while working there.

                    <span>Masayuki Uemura, the engineer who played a key part in Nintendo&#x27;s early forays into video games and was the lead architect on both the NES and SNES, has passed away at the age of 78. 
The Nintendo that Uemura joined in the 70s was still centred around hanafuda cards, and it was his engineering prowess that helped it make new inroads into the toy industry. Uemura worked alongside Gunpei Yokoi and Genyo Takeda on their early light gun games, before heading up Nintendo&#x27;s first foray into home consoles with the Color-TV series that started in 1977.

                    <span>343 has warned Halo Infinite players against using the Xbox&#x27;s Quick Resume feature for the campaign.
The campaign, which released yesterday, is set on a large slice of a Halo ring. Dotted around the ring are armour lockers that, once found, unlock cosmetics for use in the multiplayer.

                    <span>Google took steps to shut down the Glupteba botnet, at least for now. (The botnet uses the bitcoin blockchain as a backup command-and-control mechanism, making it hard to get rid of it permanently.) So Google is also suing the botnet’s operators.
It’s an interesting strategy. Let’s see if it’s successful.</span>

&quot;When will Kubernetes have IPv6?&quot; This question has been asked with increasing frequency ever since alpha support for IPv6 was first added in k8s v1.9. While Kubernetes has supported IPv6-only clusters since v1.18, migration from IPv4 to IPv6 was not yet possible at that point. At long last, dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 networking has reached general availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.23.
What does dual-stack networking mean for you? Let’s take a look…
Service API updates
Services were single-stack before 1.20, so using both IP families meant creating one Service per IP family. The user experience was simplified in 1.20, when Services were re-implemented to allow both IP families, meaning a single Service can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 workloads. Dual-stack load…</span>

                    <span>Following a judge&#x27;s ruling that Apple must allow developers the option of linking to external payment systems in their iOS apps as part of its lawsuit with Epic Games, an appeals court has permitted Apple to delay making the change until it&#x27;s fully able to hear the case.
Back in September - following a lengthy court battle arising from Apple&#x27;s decision to remove Fortnite from its App Store after Epic wilfully broke App Store guidelines by deliberately circumventing iOS&#x27; in-app payment mechanisms - California&#x27;s Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruled against all but one of Epic&#x27;s legal challenges.

                    <span>Kratos is making the leap from PlayStation to PC early next year as 2018&#x27;s acclaimed God of War heads to the platform - and in anticipation of its arrival, Sony has released a new trailer showing the PC version in action, alongside details of the enhancements it&#x27;ll bring.
God of War 2018, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, reunites with Kratos some time after his reckoning with the gods of Olympus. It&#x27;s all change as the game begins; not only has our protagonist gained a big bushy beard and slightly mellower demeanour in the interim (not to mention, got himself a son), he&#x27;s swapped the opulence of Ancient Greece for colder climes, living a quieter life in the snow-ravaged realm of the Norse Gods.

Ubisoft shared the warning in a post to its forum, explaining a full download would be required with update 1.4.1 as part of base game restructuring needed in order for the development team to support Valhalla&#x27;s &quot;future content and game updates&quot;.

                    <span>Sonic the Hedgehog is celebrating his 30th birthday this year, and the anniversary festivities are set to continue later this week, with a look at Sonic&#x27;s upcoming movie sequel and next game both now confirmed for the Game Awards. Oh, and a new movie poster has been revealed too.
Sega first unveiled its new Sonic game during the hedgehog&#x27;s special 30th birthday livestream back in May. The accompanying teaser trailer didn&#x27;t offer much beyond a quick snatch of the iconic gaming mascot speeding through a forest, but a later press release named the game - planned to launch on Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2022 - as Sonic Rangers. However, Sega later retracted that name, claiming its inclusion was a mistake.

A new Bloomberg report details the rough journey developer 343 Industries took, leading up to the release of Halo Infinite this week.

                    <span>Authors: Kubernetes 1.23 Release Team
We’re pleased to announce the release of Kubernetes 1.23, the last release of 2021!
This release consists of 47 enhancements: 11 enhancements have graduated to stable, 17 enhancements are moving to beta, and 19 enhancements are entering alpha. Also, 1 feature has been deprecated.
Major Themes
Deprecation of FlexVolume
FlexVolume is deprecated. The out-of-tree CSI driver is the recommended way to write volume drivers in Kubernetes. See this doc for more information. Maintainers of FlexVolume drivers should implement a CSI driver and move users of FlexVolume to CSI. Users of FlexVolume should move their workloads to the CSI driver.
Deprecation of klog specific flags
To simplify the code base, several logging flags were marked as deprecated in Kubernetes …</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but Halo&#x27;s live-action TV adaptation will soon get a proper reveal, courtesy of its first full-length trailer airing at this week&#x27;s Game Awards.

                    <span>Nick Offerman - perhaps best known for his portrayal of Park and Recreation&#x27;s staunchly libertarian department director Ron Swanson - has been cast as Bill in HBO&#x27;s upcoming live-action TV adaptation of The Last of Us.
That&#x27;s according to Variety, which reports Offerman will be taking over the role from Con O&#x27;Neill - who was forced to step away from the show as a result of a scheduling conflict - and will appear alongside Murray Bartlett as Frank.

                    <span>In case you weren&#x27;t aware just yet, Gran Turismo 7 is all about delivering more of a classical Gran Turismo experience, after the more experimental multiplayer-focussed Gran Turismo Sport. Which probably explains why our best look at the game in action to date comes via the reveal of classic circuit Deep Forest, which PlayStation just served up a full in-game onboard playthrough. 
The fictional Deep Forest circuit made its debut alongside the Gran Turismo series way back in 1997, and has been a fan favourite ever since. Its appearance in Gran Turismo 7 is, perhaps unsurprisingly, its most impressive yet, and the lap onboard a GT Lamborghini shows a track that&#x27;s at once visually outstanding while also being remarkably faithful to the PS1 original.

                    <span>From Ontario and not surprising:
Since September 2021, officers have investigated five incidents where suspects have placed small tracking devices on high-end vehicles so they can later locate and steal them. Brand name “air tags” are placed in out-of-sight areas of the target vehicles when they are parked in public places like malls or parking lots. Thieves then track the targeted vehicles to the victim’s residence, where they are stolen from the driveway.
Thieves typically use tools like screwdrivers to enter the vehicles through the driver or passenger door, while ensuring not to set off alarms. Once inside, an electronic device, typically used by mechanics to reprogram the factory setting, is connected to the onboard diagnostics port below the dashboard and programs the vehicle to accept a key the thieves have brought with them. Once the new key is programmed, the vehicle will start and the thieves drive it away...</span>

                    <span>Final Fantasy 14 producer and director, Naoki Yoshida, has promised to compensate players seven free days of game time following a weekend of disconnects and long queues.
In a blog posted earlier today, Yoshida said congested server queues have persisted since the start of Endwalker&#x27;s Early Access period, acknowledging it has been &quot;the cause of many inconveniences to our players&quot;.

                    <span>There are 14 multiplayer modes hidden in Halo Infinite for PC players.
Though the secret modes can only be seen by players accessing the playlist offline - which sounds counter-intuitive, given Halo Infinite is an online multiplayer shooter - players can save and share the playlists, which then makes them playable online.

                    <span>EA has released two new stories from the world of Dragon Age to celebrate Dragon Age Day this weekend.
Although the publisher confirmed it is &quot;still hard at work on building the next singleplayer focused experience for Dragon Age&quot; and that we have to wait until &quot;next year when [EA/BioWare] can talk more about what [they&#x27;re] working on&quot;, the new short stories - written by members of the BioWare team - should help tide us over.

It gives us a peek at an iconic Resident Evil enemy - the Cerberus hound - which looks super cute and healthy at first, until it turns its head and shows the rotting flesh on the other side of its skull before it flashes to the logo.

                    <span>Activision has laid off a third of the QA team from Raven Software.
Washington Post reports that the studio - which co-created Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War with Treyarch - is calling in its quality assurance contractors for meetings between 3rd and 8th December. It&#x27;s here staff will be told if they&#x27;ve been promoted or if they&#x27;ve been made redundant.

                    <span>A limited-edition Halo Infinite promotion that bundles a Master Chief-themed LA Lakers jersey, a matching Xbox wireless controller, and a Master Chief figurine is selling online for hundreds of dollars above its recommended retail price. 
The bundle - which was only available to those who could get to the Team LA store at Staples Center, Los Angeles, on Friday afternoon ahead of that evening&#x27;s match against the LA Clippers - was selling for a very reasonable $140 (£105) given the price of a controller alone can set you back £55.

                    <span>Fortnite has pulled off its latest live event - typically spectacular in scope, technically ambitious in scale, and hugely important to the game&#x27;s ongoing story. Tonight&#x27;s The End event closed the book on its Chapter 2 map forever - and gave players a glimpse at what&#x27;s next.
The End event began at the small fort built over the past week by Pleasant Park and, as players arrived, they were greeted by the welcome sight of the friendly Blue Cube teleporting into the location too. It was here players would make their last stand against the Cube Queen, head of the alien race which has now plagued Fortnite&#x27;s reality for several seasons. Maybe, with the Blue Cube on side, she could be defeated?
