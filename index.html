As per Blizzard&#x27;s announcement post, things gets underway next Wednesday, 10th May, at 7pm BST/11am PDT via Twitch and YouTube, with Diablo franchise general manager Rod Fergusson, associate game director Joseph Piepiora, product management director Kegan Clark, and associate director of community Adam Fletcher all confirmed to appear.


The conversation this time around will focus on Diablo 4&#x27;s heavy heap of, somewhat contentious, live-service elements, including its seasons model, optional battle pass, and cosmetics.

                              <span>Bungie has secured another legal win against a Destiny 2 cheat-seller, with a court this time ordering the defendant to pay $12m USD in damages.


Bungie filed a lawsuit against Romanian cheat-seller Mihai Claudiu-Florentin - who it claimed was behind Destiny 2 cheating software VeteranCheats - last year, alleging (thanks TheGamePost) copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), and intentional interference with contractual relations.


Bungie had been seeking $11,696,000 in damages, a figure based on the $2,000 Claudiu-Florentin would make from each sale of VeteranCheats across a total of 5,848 downloads. The Washington Western District Court has now granted Bungie&#x27;s request, deeming the studio to have sufficiently proven its claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract, but not of the CPA violation.

                              <span>Unity Software - the company behind the widely used Unity game engine - has announced its third round of layoffs in under 12 months, this time affecting 600 jobs, equating to approximately 8% of its total workforce.


Today&#x27;s job losses were confirmed in a company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with Unity only saying the move would affect &quot;specific teams&quot; as it continues to &quot;position itself for long-term and profitable growth&quot;.


According to the Wall Street Journal (paywalled), this latest round of layoffs will leave Unity with approximately 7,000 employees, and comes ahead of the San Francisco-based company&#x27;s plans to reduce its current global network of offices from 58 to fewer than 30.

                              <span>Pokémon TCG Live, the official free-to-play smartphone and desktop adaptation of the venerable trading card game, finally has a released day, and will be launching on 8th June.


The Pokémon Company announced Pokémon TCG Live all the way back in 2021, with the expectation it would get a soft launch in Canada that same year. Not long after, however, both the mobile soft launch and global open beta for desktop were formally delayed to 2022 to create a &quot;more polished experience&quot;.

                              <span>Hang onto your spiderwebs, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered will be getting a standalone PlayStation 5 release later this month.


Previously, this remastered version of Spider-Man&#x27;s PS4 outing was reserved for those who decided to splash out on Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition.


Those who already own any of the original PS4 versions of the game will be able to upgrade to the remastered PS5 version for $10. Meanwhile, If you are buying the game for the first time, it will set you back $49.99. There is no word on UK pricing for now, but Eurogamer has asked Sony for clarification. A quick PSA, those PlayStation Plus members who claimed any edition of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man via their subscription are not eligible for the PS5 upgrade.

It stars Double Dragon&#x27;s famous duo Billy and Jimmy Lee as well as new playable characters in what&#x27;s described as a &quot;modernised celebration&quot; of the beat &#x27;em-up genre.


There&#x27;s co-op (couch co-op for launch, online co-op later this year), 13 playable characters, and pixel art visuals. The trailer is below:

The early access launch provides a small sample of the first-person shooter, developer Offworld Industries (Squad, Post Scriptum, Beyond the Wire) said.

You play a Trooper as part of 16-player co-op versus Starship Troopers&#x27; famous nasty alien bugs. You need to complete objectives, gather resources, build and defend your base then escape to the extraction point in squads of four.

                              <span>Soviet fantasy Atomic Heart is set to receive its first piece of DLC this summer.


A new teaser trailer has been released, which hints at some of the undiscovered locations yet to be explored in Facility 3826.


It&#x27;s only 20 seconds long, but begins underwater (how very Bioshock!) before revealing some squiggly pathways in the sky. You can check it out below.

On 8th May - so, this Monday - the game&#x27;s Definitive Edition will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S (where it will also available on Game Pass). Along with these consoles, Weird West&#x27;s definitive edition will also be available for PC. 


While details on this upcoming edition are still rather scant, it does promise 4K resolution and 60fps.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a bumpy old ride for THQ Nordic&#x27;s Saints Row reboot, but, now, after several months focused on bug fixes and improvements, developer Volition has confirmed the game&#x27;s first bit of paid story DLC, The Heist and The Hazardous, will arrive next Tuesday, 9th May.


The Heist and The Hazardous, which was unveiled as part of Saints Row&#x27;s updated roadmap back in March, is the first of three promised content drops for the open-world crime caper&#x27;s paid Expansion Pass, bringing new story missions, events, cosmetics, and more.


THQ Nordic still hasn&#x27;t shared much in the way of specifics beyond that, but we do now know it&#x27;ll see the Saints embarking on an adventure to exact &quot;sweet revenge&quot; after obnoxious movie star Chris Hardy double-crosses the Boss on a successful assassination hit.

Convergence (or CONV/RGENCE, if you really must) is the third entry in Riot Forge&#x27;s genre-hopping, externally developed A League of Legends Story series, which takes familiar faces from Riot Games&#x27; wildly popular MOBA and deposits them in their own standalone adventures. 


So far, the series has featured a turn-based RPG from developer Airship Syndicate, titled Ruined King: A League of Legends Story, as well as Choice Provisions&#x27; puzzler Hextech Mayhem, and last month&#x27;s action-RPG The Mageseeker, created by Digital Sun. It&#x27;s all change again for Convergence, which shines a spotlight on League of Legends&#x27; dimension-hopping, time-manipualiting Ekko, and brings yet another a new genre focus.

Midnight Suns - which blends card-battling turn-based combat and Fire-Emblem-style relationship building into a superb superhero strategy whole - had a bit of a bumpy road to release, getting two delays before it finally launched for PC, Series X/S, and PS5 last December.


At the time of its second delay, 2K made the surprise announcement it was postponing Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Switch indefinitely, only saying those versions would launch at &quot;a later date&quot; - and we&#x27;ve had no further updates until today.

Creative mode functions pretty much as you&#x27;d expect, offering what looks to be an intuitive, fully featured construction toolkit available directly in-game. Mediatonic demoed the new mode in today&#x27;s reveal livestream, explaining that, at launch, players will be able to build Races levels using either Fall Guys&#x27; original or new digital themes - with additional themes, round types, obstacles, and music set to be added in future updates.


After budding builders have selected their round type and theme, Creative mode then whisks them into a new building view, where they can call up a list of available objects, grouped by category, including obstacles, decorations, and more.

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper is being adapted into a tabletop RPG named Cycles of the Eye.


Like the video game, it&#x27;s a solo game broken down into turns called cycles with your energy represented by dice. However, Cycles of the Eye is driven by a tarot deck of cards to represent challenges, resources, characters and more.


Citizen Sleeper was inspired by TTRPGs so this adaptation certainly makes sense.

                              <span>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can now refer a friend to PC Game Pass, and gift them 14 days of free subscription time. 


Invited friends must be new to Game Pass to redeem the trial, and you&#x27;re limited to doing this with five people. Also, to be clear, this is just for the PC portion of Game Pass. 


Still, two weeks&#x27; of free game time is nothing to be sniffed at, and this membership of course includes access to new first-party Xbox games - such as Redfall - and the included access to EA Play and Riot Games libraries.

                              <span>Square Enix has shown our first look at gameplay from Forspoken DLC - In Tanta We Trust.


Releasing on 26th May across PlayStation 5 and PC, it&#x27;s a prequel to the main game as protagonist Frey is launched back in time. 


While gameplay is more of the same, Frey will be joined on her adventure by Tanta Cinta lending her abilities during combat and exploration. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Sony has released the debut trailer for the Gran Turismo movie.


The video, below, gives us a good idea of what to expect from the film, which is directed by District 9&#x27;s Neill Blomkamp and stars the sad cop from Stranger Things and the elf who notices they&#x27;re taking the hobbits to Isengard in Lord of the Rings. 


The Gran Turismo movie is about a Gran Turismo fan who enters a competition to become a professional racer. It&#x27;s based on a true story about Jann Mardenborough, who did just that in real-life.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered what Zelda&#x27;s Adventure would be like on Game Boy? Well, wonder no more, as one intrepid fan has taken one of the series&#x27; least well-received games and turned it into something that actually looks pretty great. 


Admittedly, Zelda&#x27;s Adventure is not exactly canon in the series&#x27; timeline. Developed by Viridis Corporation, it was published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i back in 1996. 


Despite featuring a playable Zelda (in Zelda&#x27;s Adventure, it is Link who has been whisked away by Ganon), the game was pretty poorly received by, well, everyone. Everything from its graphics to its acting came under fire, and even some of the most die hard Zelda fans have generally avoided it.

                              <span>The people behind Skywind have released an impressive new gameplay video.


Skywind is the ambitious mod project that rebuilds Bethesda&#x27;s much-loved 2002 role-playing game The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind in the Skyrim engine.


Work on Skywind has gone on for years now, but this latest video, below, shows the project is coming along nicely. It shows 20 minutes of new footage, including new world spaces, creatures, environment assets, voice lines, item descriptions, user interface improvements and spells, and revolves around a quest from the original game called Necromancer in Mawia.

Thanks to an upcoming passive mode, those who simply want to take to the seas and bob around on the beautiful blue without having to worry about the denizens of the deep interrupting their serenity will be able to do just that. In short, when this free update goes live, &quot;monsters that usually attack fishing boats will no longer be aggressive&quot;. 


As well as this new feature, Dredge players can also expect a new photo mode (that comes with a new in-game character) and the addition of map markers in the future.

The event focuses on the Star Wars saga&#x27;s Prequel trilogy, and features numerous free and paid-for skins to let you play as Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala, Darth Maul and a battalion of Clone Troopers.


This collaboration also sees Fortnite debut a premium mini battle pass for the first time, offering access to some of the above skins as rewards for completing in-game challenges.

                              <span>EA has started releasing the first of its many promised post-launch patches for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. 


Following a fairly glitchy release - particularly on PC - and an initial day one update, EA is now in the process of fixing its game. (Digital Foundry went so far as to call Star Wars Jedi: Survivor  &quot;the worst triple-A PC port of 2023 so far&quot;.)  PC players will likely have already noticed a new patch, while those on consoles can expect to see this wave of fixes going live at some point today (2nd May).


 EA says this particular patch will fix multiple crashes, including those tied to skipping cinematics. It will also address various collision issues within the game, and enemy AI should no longer T-pose when players take a spin with Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s photo mode.

                              <span>NetherRealm has released what looks like the first tease for the upcoming Mortal Kombat 12.


At the end of a video, below, in which Mortal Kombat developers thank fans for their support over the past 30 years, is a brief clip showing what looks like grains of sand falling from an hourglass. One of these grains of sand, perhaps the last, explodes.


What does it mean? As you&#x27;d expect, Mortal Kombat fans are having their say. The consensus is the tease relates to Kronika&#x27;s Hourglass. Kronika, the antagonist of Mortal Kombat 11 and the self-styled Keeper of Time and Architect of History, used the Hourglass to alter time and space, which led to the fun interactions between young and old versions of the same character in Mortal Kombat 11.

The update is available already to Xbox owners in the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead test rings, and will filter out to everyone else in the coming days. 


I have the new version myself, and it&#x27;s a real upgrade. Not only is there more room to see your background, the number of game and app tiles immediately available has also been increased.

The list includes indie action hit My Friend Pedro and cosy tile-based city-builder Before We Leave, as well as popular high school murder adventure series Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair Anniversary Edition. Goodbye despair, indeed.


First-person photography game Umurangi Generation is also getting the chop, so enjoy its retro future while you can.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch blockbuster The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been ripped and uploaded to the internet, with pirated copies now passed around, and extensive sections of footage streamed and uploaded.


Yesterday, Twitch and Discord streams showing footage of the game were available to view, two weeks ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch date, before eventually being pulled offline.


It&#x27;s unclar where the leak originated, or how many copies have been made available. But while a small number of physical copies appearing in the wild may be a headache for Nintendo, the fact the game has been pirated to share and play on PC is much more of a nightmare.

We are going to need to migrate to quantum-resistant public-key algorithms, and the sooner we implement key agility the easier it will be to do so.

Kubernetes 1.20 introduced the ContainerResource type metric
in HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA).
In Kubernetes 1.27, this feature moves to beta and the corresponding feature gate (HPAContainerMetrics) gets enabled by default.
What is the ContainerResource type metric
The ContainerResource type metric allows us to configure the autoscaling based on resource usage of individual containers.
In the following example, the HPA controller scales the target
so that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is around 60%.
(See the algorithm details
to know how the desired replica number is calculated exactly)
type: ContainerResource
containerResource:
 name: cpu
 container: application
 target:
 type: Utilization

                              <span>Apex Legends: Arsenal, the 17th season of the ever popular battle royale, will land on Tuesday, 9th May. Alongside map changes, a new mastery system, and evac towers, we&#x27;re being treated to a brand new Legend to kick this season off with a bang.
August &quot;Ballistic&quot; Brinkman is a veteran of the Thunderdome Games, the predecessor to the Apex Games we know today.  After a tragedy, Ballistic retired and disappeared from public view. Until now, that is, with Ballistic back and ready to show the younger generation of Legends just how it&#x27;s done.
Ballistic&#x27;s abilities are well suited to both ranged and close quarters combat in any mode you choose to play. However, he truly shines at singling out a target and taking them out in a stylish manner. His passive &#x27;The Sling&#x27; allows him to carry a third weapon but only with its base statistics. This means no attachments or upgrades, if you put a purple tier weapon in, it will instantly become its base tier. His tactical &#x27;Whistler&#x27; can overheat enemy weapons, and his ultimate &#x27;Tempest&#x27; buffs not only him but his entire team with infinite ammunition for a period of time.

                              <span>Meta is gearing up for another VR-focused Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, this time promising over 40 minutes of announcements, first looks, and updates on 1st June.


The main event gets underway at 6pm in the UK/10am PT on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and, inevitably, Horizon Worlds, but Meta is also holding a pre-show starting 15 minutes earlier that, it says, will feature &quot;game updates and debut trailers&quot;.


Once the pre-amble is out the way, Oculus Studios executive producer Ruth Bram will take the stage to present Meta Quest&#x27;s big announcements, and that&#x27;ll be followed by a post-show developer roundtable, promising a &quot;deep-dive conversation around some upcoming games&quot;.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor players have encountered another irritating bug – and this one steals your XP.

Many of you may have already come across the enemy Mogu, a big space troll thing that packs a punch. Trouble is, it turns out that the troll hits so hard, in some cases it smashes your XP clean off – or into – the map so that you can&#x27;t recover it.  

In a reddit post entitled &quot;don&#x27;t die to this troll, he eats your XP&quot;, u/slaymaker1907 reports that there &quot;seems to be a bug where if you die to this very particular troll, you can&#x27;t get your XP back&quot;.

                              <span>PC Call of Duty players have set up a petition in a bid to convince Activision and Infinity Ward to &quot;resolve the issues introduced by season three&quot;.

Issues first began to pop up shortly after the update was rolled out, and despite tweets and messages from developer Infinity Ward assuring players that it was &quot;investigating&quot;, the problems still persist for some.

The issue has primarily been affecting players with AMD Vega GPUs and other Vega hardware, resulting in almost immediate crashes for PC players trying to access either Modern Warfare 2 or Warzone 2.0.

The team says that &quot;the Lumen, Ray Tracing, and Niagara effects&quot; help &quot;create visuals and effects that are beyond words and feel lifelike&quot;.

The new trailer follows an 11-minute video that dropped last month which also showed off the gameplay changes and new visuals.

                              <span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie is expected to cross $1 billion at the worldwide box office later today (Sunday, 30th April).

We already knew the Super Mario Bros. Movie was doing alright for itself, and that it&#x27;s now officially the highest grossing film of 2023 so far and the biggest video game adaptation of all time, but if it does hit that milestone later today, it will only be the 10th animated movie to do so.

That&#x27;s according to The Hollywood Reporter, which says the North American projected weekend gross for the movie is $37.5 million for a domestic tally of $487.5 million through Sunday.

If you pass a certain point early in the game – usually within the first two to three hours, although this depends upon how quickly you&#x27;re trying to get through the story, of course – and die before you save, you risk respawning into a trapped location, effectively blocking your progress.

Like the OP, it&#x27;s not possible to warn you of the issue without at least spoiling a couple of non-story things, so proceed with caution if you&#x27;re anxious to play without any spoilers whatsoever.

In a statement posted to the developer&#x27;s social media channels, Capcom said that any such access outside of sanctioned beta periods would be deemed a &quot;violation of the Capcom Pro Tour code of conduct&quot;.

&quot;It has come to our attention that some users have been accessing the Street Fighter 6 Closed Beta Test (CBT) software and playing the game outside of the designated period,&quot; the statement begins.

                              <span>US ratings board ESRB has revealed a new Tomb Raider collection is on the way to Switch.

Whilst the games included in the collection have not been named, it&#x27;s likely they are spin-offs Guardian of Light and Temple of Osiris, as the Switch port for those titles was quietly delayed at the end of last year.

&quot;This is a collection of two action-adventure games in which players help Lara Croft and her allies search for artifacts to stop ancient gods from destroying the world,&quot; the rating&#x27;s description explains, again without specifically confirming what the two games are called.

In an interview Barron&#x27;s and spotted by PC Gamer, Zampella acknowledged that whilst the studio didn&#x27;t have &quot;exact dedicated plans&quot; and was not &quot;working on anything currently&quot; connected to a new Titanfall game, &quot;it&#x27;s such a beloved franchise for the gams and also for [Respawn developers]&quot;.

&quot;I hate to say yes, then people latch onto that, and then skewer you when it doesn&#x27;t come,&quot; Zampella said. &quot;But I would love to see it happen is the real answer.

                              <span>As Star Wars Jedi: Survivor continues to rack up negative reviews on Steam for its PC performance issues, EA has released a statement to purchasers saying it&#x27;s &quot;aware [the game] isn&#x27;t performing to our standards&quot; and insisting it&#x27;s &quot;committed to fixing these issues&quot;.


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor recieved a favourable critical reception earlier this week - Eurogamer called it &quot;really fun&quot; despite a &quot;lack of focus&quot; - but reports of serious PC performance problems soon emerged following today&#x27;s launch. Currently, the game has a &quot;mostly negative&quot; rating on Steam, with users highlighting poor frame rates, crashes, and more.


Prior to launch, EA had already promised players it would be deploying patches over the next few weeks to fix bugs, improve performance, and expand on accessibility features - hardly an encouraging start for customers expected to pay up to £70 for the game - but now the publisher has addressed Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s reported PC flaws in more direct terms.

                              <span>One day after word of its US air date began to circulate, Sony&#x27;s Twisted Metal live-action television series has received its first trailer.


More accurately, today&#x27;s first look is being described as an &quot;official teaser&quot;, which probably does a better job of managing your expectations. It&#x27;s short on action - and pretty much anything at all you might think of when you hear the words &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; - but it does introduce Anthony Mackie in his starring role.


Mackie, you might recall, plays a &quot;motor-mouthed outsider&quot; who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life, as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland. We don&#x27;t get to see much of that in today&#x27;s teaser, but there is a vaguely amusing musical bait-and-switch, a bit of aerial footage, and thankfully - given the video game series&#x27; vehicular combat roots - at least one shot of a car with some guns stuck to the front.

                              <span>Lego has unveiled four Donkey Kong sets heading to its Lego Super Mario range this August.


Today&#x27;s reveal follows the tease earlier this week that Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong, and Funky Kong would all be getting the Lego treatment, with Lego now confirming three of those characters will receive their own sets.


First up is the £57.99/€64.99/$59.99 USD Donkey Kong&#x27;s Tree House Expansion Set, weighing in at 555 pieces. Alongside a Lego DK figure and his iconic homestead, this set features palm trees, a buildable TV, radio, and secret compartment, plus a Cranky Kong figure.

                              <span>A Vampire Survivors animated TV series is in the works.

Deadline reports the indie hit is set for a TV adaptation courtesy of Story Kitchen, which is working with Vampire Survivors creator Luca &quot;Poncle&quot; Galante.


In Vampire Survivors you move a pixelly character around a simple top-downish environment that steadily fills with enemies. Your character attacks automatically so you just wander around, avoiding directly connecting with enemies while putting them within damage range. Enemies drop experience orbs when they die for you to collect, and when you level up you get to spend your experience on a random choice of new attacks or perks or buffs.

                              <span>The directors of horror movie Talk to Me are reportedly set to helm the new Street Fighter film.
Australian twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou are in final negotiations to direct the live-action adaptation of the famous fighting game franchise, according to Hollywood Reporter.


We don&#x27;t know anything about the movie yet, although Hollywood Reporter speculates that if the up-and-coming Philippous are being hired off the back of Talk to Me (trailer below), &quot;tension and gore may be on the agenda.&quot; Perhaps we&#x27;ll see Ryu split Sagat&#x27;s chest open with a Dragon Punch?

                              <span>What happens if Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn buyout of Activision Blizzard falls through, as seems distinctly possible following the Competition and Markets Authority&#x27;s shock decision to block the deal?


It&#x27;s a question Xbox boss Phil Spencer reportedly answered to staff at an all-hands meeting on Thursday, according to Bloomberg (paywall).


According to Bloomberg, Spencer stressed Microsoft remains committed to getting the deal over the line while acknowledging the damaging impact of this week&#x27;s events. The company, alongside Activision Blizzard, plans to appeal.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor released today, but so far things are not looking too good for Cal Kestis&#x27; latest outing on PC. 


Over on Steam, the game currently sits with a &quot;mostly negative&quot; reception, with many lamenting its poor performance. At the time of writing, only 34 percent of Steam reviews for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor are positive. 


&quot;Runs like my ass after Taco Bell,&quot; wrote one player, and they are far from alone with this sentiment (although, so far at least, alone with that particular wording).

(A good dream? Absolutely. Though also one where you check everything&#x27;s still on before standing in front of the class.)


Needless to say, everything about this feels a huge honour and oppurtunity. After 13 years here writing puns and making sure everyone puts the accent on Pokémon, there&#x27;s little else other than Eurogamer I care about so deeply.

                              <span>Valve has released a new update for its Steam Client Beta. 


This update adds a swathe of pretty nifty features and improvements, including the ability to pin windows from the overlay, so they appear on top of the game while in-game. This means that, in Valve&#x27;s words, &quot;yes, you can watch movies while you play games if you really want to&quot; (although, I think it really meant this feature to be more for things like guides and notes). 


As for those notes, this update adds a Notes app. The app does pretty much everything you would expect it to. It lets you take down notes about your game, and comes with &quot;rich text formatting, the ability to have multiple notes per game, and can even be used in offline mode&quot;. Your notes will be saved per game, and are then synced to other PCs that you are logged into.

&quot;This is bringing the AAA racing genre to the blind community to the fullest,&quot; said Cole in the video.

Needless to say, this is an enormously impressive figure considering the game only came out two days ago, even if it is free to download.


The game has broken records by reaching the number one spot on the iOS game download chart in more countries than any game that has come before, as noted by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad.

                              <span>Sony has now sold over 38m PlayStation 5 consoles, after selling a huge 6.3m units in the past quarter.


That&#x27;s a record high for this specific quarter for sales of any console in history. The equivalent sales of the console last year were 2m units. By further comparison, the PS4&#x27;s biggest Q4 sales were 3m units.


Added to last quarter&#x27;s 7.1m units and it&#x27;s clear that PlayStation 5 sales are very much on an upward trajectory following stock shortages since launch.

                              <span>The UK government has called out Microsoft&#x27;s president Brad Smith for his comments on the now-blocked Activision Blizzard acquisition.


Earlier this week, the UK stopped Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn effort to buy Activision in its tracks, prompting a furious response from Smith, who branded the move as &quot;bad for Britain&quot;.


&quot;Those sorts of claims are not borne out by the facts,&quot; a spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said last night (via Reuters).

                              <span>In its ongoing bid to acquire Activision Blizzard - something that saw a major set back earlier this week, after UK regulators dramatically blocked the deal -  Microsoft has announced yet another 10-year commitment. 


This latest deal is with cloud gaming platform Nware. Sharing the news on Twitter, Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote: &quot;Microsoft and European cloud gaming platform Nware have signed a 10-year agreement to stream PC games built by Xbox on its platform, as well as Activision Blizzard titles after the acquisition closes. 


&quot;While it&#x27;s still early for the emerging cloud segment in gaming, this new partnership combined with our other recent commitments will make more popular games available on more cloud game streaming services than they are today.&quot;

                              <span>Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition is readying to reach even further into the series&#x27; past with the announcement of its Return of Rome DLC, a &quot;new form&quot; of the original Age of Empires&#x27; Rise of Rome expansion that&#x27;s coming to PC and consoles on 16th May.


There&#x27;s quite a lot going on in Rise of Rome - which purchasers will need to switch to from the main screen in order to access its new stuff - but the most notable addition for series fans is arguably the return of all 16 civilisations from the original Age of Empires and Rise of Rome.


That means the Assyrians, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Choson, Egyptians, Greeks, Hittites, Macedonians, Minoans, Palmyrans, Persians, Phoenicians, Romans, Shang, Sumerians, and Yamato will all be playable in Rise of Rome, with the Romans being unique in that they&#x27;ll also be available to play in Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition&#x27;s base game.

                              <span>Arkane&#x27;s co-op vampire shooter Redfall is just a week away now, and as the clock ticks down to release, Microsoft has shared a bunch of new info, including a new trailer, details on its accessibility options, and its PC system requirements - the latter being particularly intriguing in light of the recently announced 30fps limit on consoles.


Starting with Redfall&#x27;s accessibility options, these have now been shared as part of a full &quot;settings&quot; breakdown over on Arkane&#x27;s blog. Accessbility options, specifically, include the likes of text-to-speech and speech-to-text support, screen narration, subtitles and closed captioning, font scaling, a colour blindness filter, notification duration settings, and an optional &quot;accessibility reticule&quot; for anyone that would benefit from a permanent fixation point on-screen.


Arkane has also provided an extensive list of more general settings, highlighting things like toggleable head bob and camera shake, optional object highlights, and four difficulty settings - three of which are available when first starting the game. It&#x27;s well worth checking out the full article for the considerably more expanded breakdown.

                              <span>Warner Bros&#x27; co-op action-adventure Gotham Knights has just received another update, this one bringing fixes, accessibility improvements, and a surprise new 15-floor Heroic Assault raid.


Gotham Knights, of course, recieved a lukewarm reception when it launched last October, with particularly stern words being saved for its myriad technical issues. Since then, developer Warner Bros Montreal has been tinkering under the hood to improve the experience - with notable success, as Digital Foundry noted recently - making today&#x27;s update the latest in a long line of patches.


With most of the game&#x27;s glaring technical issues seemingly now resolved, its latest update - which notably features accessibility improvements such as controller remapping, improved screen-reader support, and button press toggles, as detailed in the accompanying patch notes - is less about fixes and more about new content.

                              <span>A little over two years after first details emerged, the Twisted Metal live-action TV series has a US air date, with its premiere now set for 27th July.


This 10 half-hour-long episode adaptation of the primarily PlayStation-exclusive vehicular combat series - which, slightly alarmingly, is now approaching its 30th anniversary - tells the story of a motor-mouthed outsider (played by Anthony Mackie) who&#x27;s offered a chance at a better life, as long as he can deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland.


Sony first touted turning Twisted Metal into a television show back in 2019, but it wasn&#x27;t until 2021 that the wheels officially got in motion. Since then, US subscription service Peacock has placed an order for the action comedy, while Cobra Kai&#x27;s Michael Jonathan Smith has signed up as showrunner and to pen the scripts - which are based on a concept by Zombieland and Deadpool writing duo Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.

                              <span>Point and click puzzle game The Case of the Golden Idol will receive a new expansion next month. 


On 4th May, players will be able to head into the game&#x27;s The Spider of Lanka expansion, in a bid to puzzle out just what exactly is going on across three new scenarios. This expansion will be in a completely new setting. In fact, so new, it is all taking place &quot;thousands of miles from the rainy hills of Blackfield.&quot;


The Spider of Lanka kicks off a year before The Case of the Golden Idol&#x27;s first scenario, and follows the story of Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller as they make their maiden voyage to the Kingdom of Lanka. Here, they will visit... actually, I can&#x27;t tell you that. In the true spirit of The Case of the Golden Idol, that information has been redacted. I can share this trailer with you though, so please do sit back and enjoy.

Kubernetes v1.26 introduced a new, alpha-level feature for
StatefulSets that controls
the ordinal numbering of Pod replicas. As of Kubernetes v1.27, this feature is
now beta. Ordinals can start from arbitrary
non-negative numbers. This blog post will discuss how this feature can be
used.
Background
StatefulSets ordinals provide sequential identities for pod replicas. When using
OrderedReady Pod management
Pods are created from ordinal index 0 up to N-1.
With Kubernetes today, orchestrating a StatefulSet migration across clusters is
challenging. Backup and restore solutions exist, but these require the
application to be scaled down to zero replicas prior to migration. In today&#x27;s
fully connected world, even planned application downtime may not allow you to

They&#x27;re everywhere in the Soulsborne games: loved by Miyazaki and hated by players. We even rated them all.

In its 415-page final report detailing its shock decision to block Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover, the UK regulator addressed Microsoft&#x27;s insistence it could get Call of Duty in its current form up and running on Nintendo consoles should the deal be approved.

&quot;COD is currently available on two gaming consoles - Xbox and PlayStation,&quot; reads the CMA&#x27;s report.

As Matt reported on Monday, this union - which calls itself the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega, or AEGIS-CWA for short - aims to secure higher base pay, improved benefits, and a number of other goals.


In response, Sega of America&#x27;s president and COO Ian Curran wrote a letter to all employees, addressing the formation of AEGIS.

However, one of his more recent posts has caused quite a stir from his followers. Earlier today, the Metal Gear creator shared a picture of himself standing beside Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud (there was also a Kojima Productions mascot there).


For a bit of background, Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud is president of the Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS) and the Arab eSports Federation. He is also vice president of the Global Esports Federation.

Monthly active users for Activision games - primarily its Call of Duty series - fell to 98 million as of the 31st March, down from 111 million at the end of December 2022. 


It&#x27;s a figure roughly equal to that seen at the end of September last year, before the arrival of Modern Warfare 2 and the big 2.0 relaunch of live service Warzone in November.

Along with a now customary day one patch, the team at EA has additionally stated it will be releasing several more patches for the game in the &quot;weeks ahead&quot;, begging the question - is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor actually ready for launch? 


In a brief update, EA said players can expect patches that will fix bugs, improve the game&#x27;s performance and add more accessibility features in the weeks following Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s launch.


The language used by EA and early reports from some reviewers have left some fans wondering whether the game needed longer before launch, rather than arriving with issues that need to be subsequently ironed out.

                              <span>Sony has announced a Final Fantasy 16 themed PlayStation 5 bundle, but it&#x27;s only available in Japan.


The limited edition bundle includes the console with special face plates - themed with the game&#x27;s logo of Eikons Phoenix and Ifrit in battle - as well as a specially designed controller. Of course, it comes with a code for the game too.



However, outside of Japan there&#x27;s simply a bundle with the game, minus the fancy themed hardware.

Ehreth - who also served as campaign designer on Halo 4 and 5 - will be joined by head of operations Pere Torrents, as well as &quot;colleagues with decades of combined experience in the industry&quot; and credits on Halo, Ghost of Tsushima, Red Dead Redemption 2, and The Division.  


Anchor Point, which will have offices in Barcelona and Seattle, is currently hiring &quot;up to 100 people across Europe and North America&quot; - with roles including developers, technical artists, and designers - to work either on-site, remotely, or in a hybrid capacity.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has released a fourth update for its widely lambasted PC port of The Last of Us Part 1, promising &quot;framerate optimisation&quot; and more among its various bug fixes and tweaks.


As you may recall, The Last of Us Part 1 finally launched for PC at the end of March after a 25-day delay designed to ensure it would debut &quot;in the best shape possible.&quot; Unfortunately, the reality of the release didn&#x27;t live up to that promise, and PC purchasers on Steam quickly began reporting a host of technical issues, including inconsistent frame rates, regular crashes, stuttering, long load times, and poor optimisation - earning the port a Mostly Negative rating.


Since then, Naughty Dog has released three patches aimed at addressing the PC port&#x27;s various problems, and those fixes have slowly helped nudge The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s Steam rating up to a marginally less disastrous Mixed. And today&#x27;s 1.0.4 update aims to improve matters further, bringing an extensive list of changes focused around &quot;framerate optimisation, graphical and texture fidelity, crash fixes, and more&quot;.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bunch of activity going on around developer Amplitude&#x27;s sprawling historical 4X strategy game Humankind right now, and as part of all that, its newly released Para Bellum Wonder Pack DLC is currently free to claim and keep, but only for a limited time.


The Para Bellum Wonder Pack adds a total of six new cultural wonders, one for each of the game&#x27;s successive eras. The Stables of Pi-Ramesses are available first in Era 1 and are followed by the Colosseum, the Citadel of Alamut, the Hôtel des Invalides, Whilelmshaven Werft, and, as we step into the modern era, the Pentagon.


As you might imagine, each Wonder brings various benefits to the empires that build them, ranging from increased land movement speed and reduced cavalry/land vehicle upkeep for the Stables of Pi-Ramesses through to increased district fortication and bombardment benefits via the Pentagon. A full breakdown of these bonuses can be found in Amplitude&#x27;s announcement.

                              <span>Pokémon Go will hold its first-ever Go Fest event in the UK this summer, with a three-day bonanza centred in London&#x27;s Brockwell Park.


Go Fest 2023 in London will run from Friday 4th to Sunday 6th August, with early bird tickets on sale now (for £27). As with last year&#x27;s Seattle Go Fest, each day will be split with a half-day in the park, and the rest of the day spent exploring the local area - this time, with bonuses available throughout Greater London.


A version based in Osaka, Japan will run over the same dates, while New York has been chosen to host the event&#x27;s USA leg on 18th to 20th August.

                              <span>Stanford and Georgetown have a new report on the security risks of AI—particularly adversarial machine learning—based on a workshop they held on the topic.
Jim Dempsey, one of the workshop organizers, wrote a  blog post on the report:
As a first step, our report recommends the inclusion of AI security concerns within the cybersecurity programs of developers and users. The understanding of how to secure AI systems, we concluded, lags far behind their widespread adoption. Many AI products are deployed without institutions fully understanding the security risks they pose. Organizations building or deploying AI models should incorporate AI concerns into their cybersecurity functions using a risk management framework that addresses security throughout the AI system life cycle. It will be necessary to grapple with the ways in which AI vulnerabilities are different from traditional cybersecurity bugs, but the starting point is to assume that AI security is a subset of cybersecurity and to begin applying vulnerability management practices to AI-based features.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast we discuss the fallout from today&#x27;s dramatic decision by the UK to block Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal, and whether an appeal could still turn things around. 

With the UK regulator issuing a stern warning over how it sees the deal impacting competitiveness among cloud gaming companies, it remains to be seen how much more Microsoft could do to reassure the UK without structurally changing the deal. Or does, perhaps, Microsoft say the UK should not have given up on this so easily, by saying a block on the deal was simply the most straightforward option?
So, do we think an appeal could still succeed? And what will it take? Joining me to share their thoughts are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been seven months since the last instalment of developer Jupiter&#x27;s mighty Picross puzzle series on Switch, meaning there are probably a fair few fans in need of a fresh fix right about now. Luckily, help is on the way, with Picross S9 officially launching tomorrow, 27th April.


This ninth mainline series entry on Switch introduces a grand total of 485 new puzzles, so plenty of fresh deductive, dot-plopping column action to be getting on with. 300 of those are Picross and Mega Picross puzzles, 150 are Clip Picross, 30 are Colour Picross, and the remaining five are Extra puzzles - three of which will require you to link play data from Picross S6, S7, and S8.


Additionally, the local co-op mode introduced in Picross&#x27; previous instalment makes a return in S9, meaning up to four players can work together to solve its new conundrums.

                              <span>A range of Donkey Kong characters are set to join the Lego Super Mario family in the near future, the toy company has announced. 


Continuing the push for Donkey Kong seen in Nintendo&#x27;s theme parks (and, rumours suggest, perhaps also next on the big screen) are a range of Lego Super Mario sets featuring the ape and his many pals. 


Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong and Funky Kong all pop up in a quick teaser posted by Lego to Twitter this afternoon. It remains to be seen how many extra sets you&#x27;ll need to buy to collect them all.

                              <span>Trombone Champ developer Holy Wow has added a brand new, incredibly difficult track: Flight of the Bumblebee.


The piece, for you music nerds, was composed by Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov as an interlude for his opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan (composed from 1899-1900). It&#x27;s a notoriously tricky piece full of fast, buzzing melodies.


Thankfully, this latest update to the game also adds in a Practice Mode so players can reduce the speed by up to 50 percent. Phew!

                              <span>Nintendo will attend Gamescom this year, event organisers have announced. It&#x27;ll be the first time Nintendo has shown up at the German mega-show since 2019.


Nintendo&#x27;s appearance at Gamescom suggests it will have something meaningful to show there. But what? The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4 will both have been released by the time Gamescom opens in late August. Could Nintendo have something hardware related to unveil to the world?


With the all-conquering Nintendo Switch in its sixth year of life, it certainly feels about time the Japanese company at least talked about what&#x27;s next.

                              <span>Microsoft has said it will appeal today&#x27;s shock decision by UK regulators to block its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition - but how will this work, and could it still be a success?


Appealing today&#x27;s decision will be a lengthy process for Microsoft, and hamper any chance of the deal being approved globally for months - and that&#x27;s without the separate decisions still due from the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU&#x27;s European Commission, both of which are still scrutinising the deal for themselves.


&quot;According to the Competition Appeal Tribunal site, straightforward cases are aimed to be dealt with within nine months,&quot; games industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told Eurogamer today. &quot;If the appeal is successful it is then returned to the CMA to review. This again will take some time.

In an internal email, published publicly, Kotick stated the result &quot;isn&#x27;t the news we wanted - but it is far from the final word on this deal&quot;.


He also confirmed that the decision will be contested, alongside Microsoft. &quot;We&#x27;re confident in our case because the facts are on our side: this deal is good for competition,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Indie game developer Young Horses has released four of its games for free, each of which is available on Steam right now.  


Young horses is perhaps best known for Bugsnax, a game that tasks players with finding and capturing the eponymous half-bug-half-snack creatures on a mysterious island, and Octodad, which sees players taking on the role of an octopus posing as a human man with a normal, human family (something that is easier said than done!).


You can expect more of the teams&#x27; eclectic flair in this latest offering of new and older games. Young Horses has released IndependANT, Antbassador, Snakedate and Octodad: Student Edition under its &quot;Free Range initiative&quot;. While the developer calls these releases &quot;smaller side projects&quot;, each of them looks like a lot of fun to while away some time.

Other options include fully remapping the controls, subtitle and visual options, and multiple difficulty settings.


&quot;With Jedi: Survivor, we&#x27;ve been able to build on what we learned from Fallen Order,&quot; said Jonas Lundqvist, senior director of development, in a new blog post on the topic.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal has been dramatically blocked by UK regulators, following a months-long investigation. 


The decision by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority prevents Microsoft from buying the publisher behind Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, follows earlier concerns it would lead to an unfair impact on archrival PlayStation. 

Instead, today&#x27;s decision stems from the CMA&#x27;s concerns over the deal&#x27;s proposed impact on the cloud gaming sector. In today&#x27;s final report, the CMA said Microsoft&#x27;s ownership of Activision Blizzard risked &quot;stifling competition in this growing market&quot;. In response, Microsoft has said it will now appeal.

While this may give a strong indication as to whether the merger is approved globally, the US Federal Trade Commision (FTC) still has the hearing for its complaint to stop the merger filed back in December. That&#x27;s set for 2nd August, after Microsoft&#x27;s 18th July merger deadline expires.



As such, Microsoft is planning a swift end to the FTC&#x27;s deal concerns, reports the New York Post.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s gaming revenue fell four percent and Xbox hardware revenue declined 30 percent in the latest financial quarter, the company has reported.


While Microsoft does not report console sales and did not provide an updated number for Game Pass subscribers (it had 25m as of January 2022), it&#x27;s clear the company is struggling to sell Xbox consoles. In fact Xbox console sales have struggled for some time. Xbox Series X and S sales were down during the crucial holiday quarter last year, and it looks like they were down in the quarter ending 31st March this year, too.


The only bright spot for Microsoft was a slight three percent increase in Xbox content and services revenue. The company said this was &quot;driven by better-than-expected monetisation in third-party and first-party content, and growth in Xbox Game Pass&quot;.

                              <span>It barely seems like yesterday, developer Rusty Lake was wowing us with its wonderfully inventive co-operative puzzler The Past Within, but now the studio is back to announced its next adventure, Undergound Blossom, coming later this year.


To date, Rusty Lake has released 16 games under the Rusty Lake and Cube Escape banner - some fully fledged premium offerings, others free-to-play companion pieces - blending casual point-and-click puzzling and room-escape-style conundrums into a wonderfully sinister, narratively intertwined saga charting the lives of the Vanderboom family.


As with developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s last few titles, the newly announced Underground Blossom ditches the Rusty Lake moniker but is still very much set in its sprawling universe, this time taking players on a journey via the Rusty Lake underground system through the life and memories of Laura Vanderboom - first introducd all the way back in Cube Escape: Seasons.

                              <span>There’s good reason to fear that A.I. systems like ChatGPT and GPT4 will harm democracy. Public debate may be overwhelmed by industrial quantities of autogenerated argument. People might fall down political rabbit holes, taken in by superficially convincing bullshit, or obsessed by folies à deux relationships with machine personalities that don’t really exist.
These risks may be the fallout of a world where businesses deploy poorly tested A.I. systems in a battle for market share, each hoping to establish a monopoly.
But dystopia isn’t the only possible future. A.I. could advance the public good, not private profit, and bolster democracy instead of undermining it. That would require an A.I. not under the control of a large tech monopoly, but rather developed by government and available to all citizens. This public option is within reach if we want it...</span>

                              <span>Obsidian&#x27;s pint-sized garden survival adventure Grounded is back with its big 1.2 update, this time adding the likes of wasps, a construction gnat (exactly what it sounds like), and Steam Deck verification, fixing some previously troublesome issues on Valve&#x27;s handheld.


Starting with Steam Deck verification, 1.2 remedies a range of problems, meaning initial loading and log-in should now function properly, prompts should no longer flicker between gamepad and mouse/keyboard controls, and the virtual keyboard should now correctly appear as needed. Obsidian has also optimised and tuned Grounded&#x27;s default graphics settings on Steam Deck for a more &quot;enjoyable experience&quot;.


Elsewhere, Grounded&#x27;s 1.2 update introduces new foes in the form of wasps, which can be found guarding their mini-hives around the yard or situated in more challenging Wasp Nests, where players can also encounter the new Wasp Queen boss. Defeating Grounded&#x27;s latest enemies will unlock new items to craft, including armour.

                              <span>Sega is readying itself for a summer of maraca-shaking mayhem it moves to bring its classic rhythm-action game Samba de Amigo to Switch - and ahead of its arrival, the publisher has revealed 20 of the 40 tracks it&#x27;ll be shipping with on launch day.


Samba de Amigo: Party Central, as Sega is calling this new Switch version, takes the infectious rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - which sees players following on-screen prompts to furiously shake their maracas in time with the music and in the desired position - but spices things up with a bunch of new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


Sega previously confirmed Party Central would feature 40 tracks at launch, but was a little vague about what they might be beyond a couple of Sonic the Hedgehog tunes. Now, though, it&#x27;s revealed 20 of the licensed tracks players can rhythmically flail to, with artists including Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepson, and Gloria Gaynor, plus some returning song favourites, such as Ricky Martin&#x27;s La Copa de la Vida and La Bamba.

                              <span>Netflix has released its first teaser trailer for the third season of The Witcher, the last to feature Henry Cavill as Geralt.


There&#x27;s a release date too, with the series split into two volumes: the first will arrive on 29th June, the second will follow on 27th July. That&#x27;s a frequent occurrence on Netflix these days, so viewers can binge a few episodes but not the full season in one go.


Here&#x27;s that official teaser trailer:

Star Trek: Resurgence is a Telltale-style narrative game set shortly after the Star Trek: The Next Generation&#x27;s timeline (that&#x27;s the show with Picard, Riker and Troi etc). Here&#x27;s the official blurb:

&quot;A worker uprising threatens the tenuous peace between two alien civilisations, and Starfleet is forced to intervene. Players experience the conflict and larger mystery from two key perspectives. The U.S.S. RESOLUTE&#x27;s First Officer Jara Rydek is part of the diplomatic envoy led by Ambassador Spock that&#x27;s tasked with finding a resolution – and uncovering the ultimate source of this tense situation.

                              <span>After its initial reveal on April 1st this year, Asus is finally ready to shed more light on its ROG Ally handheld gaming PC, which launches on May 11th and will be sold by Currys in the UK. The Steam Deck competitor looks to be a more premium device than Valve&#x27;s offering, with a faster AMD Ryzen Z1 series processor, seven-inch 1080p 120Hz touch screen and Windows 11 - but no price has yet been announced. 
The hardware side of the equation is perhaps the most fascinating, so let&#x27;s begin there. The Ally is powered by a &#x27;custom&#x27; Ryzen Z1 chipset that includes Zen 4 CPU cores and RDNA 3 graphics produced on a 4nm node. (By comparison, current Ryzen 7000 desktop designs use a mixture of 5nm and 6nm processes, which should give the Ally&#x27;s APU an advantage in terms of performance per watt.) We expect to see configurations of the device featuring the Z1 (6C/12T, 22MB cache, 2.8TF 4CU GPU) and Z1 Extreme (8C/16T, 24MB cache, 8.6TF 12CU GPU) processors announced by AMD earlier today, offering increasing levels of horsepower for a higher asking price. 
Speaking of which, the impressive-looking APU is backed with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM in dual-channel mode, while storage is up to a 512GB PCIe 4.0 SSD and UHS-2 Micro SD card expansion - faster than what is available on the Deck, which is limited to PCIe 3.0 storage and UHS-1 Micro SD cards. Wi-Fi 6E is also included, in comparison to WiFi 5 on Steam Deck. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether all SKUs of the Ally come with the full complement of RAM and storage, or whether this will be pared back on the cheaper options.

                              <span>The ongoing feud between Blizzard and NetEase ramped up this week after reports out of China suggested NetEase had filed a lawsuit against the World of Warcraft maker demanding £35m.

Wowhead covered a report from Sina Technology that claimed NetEase has filed a lawsuit in Shanghai against Blizzard seeking ¥300 million in refunds for discontinued games and services to the over one million players it had in the region before servers were shut down in January.


World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm and the StarCraft series became unplayable in China on 24th January, when NetEase&#x27;s licence expired (mobile game Diablo Immortal was unaffected).

                              <span>We are just a mere few weeks away from Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s launch, and in anticipation Nintendo has released a new TV spot.


For those keeping track, this trailer is the finished product from last week&#x27;s leaked footage. Titled &quot;You can do what?!&quot;, the TV spot highlights some of Link&#x27;s new abilities, such as Fuse and Ultrahand. 


We can see Link creating a hovercraft of sorts to coast over the lands of Hyrule. Then, he battles a Flame Gleeok (essentially confirming the theory that we will be facing different varieties of Gleeok enemy in Tears of the Kingdom) with a fused shield and he uses his Ascend ability to pop up through an enemy camp. You can see the trailer for yourself below:

                              <span>Diablo 4 hardcore characters who die in PvP suffer permadeath, Blizzard has signalled.


Blizzard community director Adam Fletcher confirmed the feature in a tweet. It means that if your hardcore character dies in PvP, you will have to make a new character.


Diablo veterans will be familiar with the consequences of death when playing hardcore characters. Indeed, Blizzard has in the past warned Diablo players it is in no way responsible for their hardcore characters, and will not restore them under any circumstances.

Announced at the tail-end of 2021, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is being developed by Sumo Nottingham, sounds pretty par for the course amid the current crop of asymmetrical horror games like Dead by Daylight and Evil Dead: The Game.


It pits a brand-new cast of youthful &quot;victims&quot; against a single, powerful foe - in this case, a killer family member either plucked from or inspired by Tobe Hooper&#x27;s 1974 horror classic.

                              <span>EA has called on the internet to avoid posting Star Wars Jedi: Survivor spoilers after an apparent leak of the game ahead of its release.


Copies of Respawn&#x27;s upcoming action sequel appeared to get into the hands of people four days before its 28th April release date - and of course story spoilers hit the internet soon after.

&quot;No spoilers!&quot; reads a tweet from the EA Star Wars account.

This latest unionisation effort is being organised in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America labour union - which has previously assisted employees at the likes of Activision Blizzard King and ZeniMax Studios - and represents a broad selection of departments and disciplines at Sega&#x27;s  Irvine, California headquarters.


According to Axios, the group - which calls itself the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega, or AEGIS-CWA for short - consists of 144 employees with roles across marketing, localisation, product development, and quality assurance.

                              <span>The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a 2021 ruling on Epic Games&#x27; antitrust lawsuit against Apple, which both parties had appealed.


Epic launched its lawsuit against the iPhone maker in August 2020, following the company&#x27;s decision to revoke Epic&#x27;s Fortnite developer account, blocking the battle royale game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple&#x27;s 30 percent platform fees.


The following year, California&#x27;s Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. However, Gonzalez-Rogers did side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers linking out to alternative payment methods from within apps - a practice known as &quot;anti-steering&quot; - as that would constitute &quot;anti-competitive conduct&quot; under state law.

                              <span>It might have had a bit of a tumultuous development journey - to put it mildly - but Dead Island 2 is off to a flying start, having successfully shifted over 1m copies in its first three days of release.


Dead Island 2 finally launched last Friday, almost nine years after publisher Deep Silver announced it was in development. Since then, it&#x27;s seen no less than three studios at the helm, but, despite that rocky road to release, its final form - which reached the finish line under the stewardship of Dambuster Studios - has clearly captured the public&#x27;s imagination.


In its press release announcing Dead Island 2&#x27;s blast through the 1m sales barrier in just 72 hours, Deep Silver shared a selection of other notable stats. Over the course of those three days since launch, for instance, players have racked up 11m hours of play time, and 28m deaths.

Key Findings
Based on an analysis of samples shared with us by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, we developed indicators that enabled us to identify at least five civil society victims of QuaDream’s spyware and exploits in North America, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Victims include journalists, political opposition figures, and an NGO worker. We are not naming the victims at this time.
We also identify traces of a suspected iOS 14 zero-click exploit used to deploy QuaDream’s spyware. The exploit was deployed as a zero-day against iOS versions 14.4 and 14.4.2, and possibly other versions. The suspected exploit, which we call ...</span>

Since launching the Auto-refreshing Official CVE feed as an alpha
feature in the 1.25 release, we have made significant improvements and updates. We are excited to announce the release of the

                              <span>Developer Respawn has introduced the latest member to Apex Legends&#x27; playable roster: disgraced Thunderdome Games champion Ballistic, who&#x27;ll be joining the free-to-play battle royale hit on 9th May as part of its new season.


As is now customary, Ballistic - real name August Montgomery Brinkman - gets his grand unveiling in a new episode of Respawn&#x27;s Stories from the Outlands. Here, we meet him taking a lonely stroll through his lavish mansion before settling down for a recap of his Thunderdome career, which ended tragically with the death of his teammate and brother-in-law.


Since then, Ballistic has become a recluse, neglecting his family until they chose to leave. Which is where Respawn&#x27;s cinematic switches back to the present, and when we - and Ballistic - learn his son, Nathaniel, has just qualified for the Apex Games.

                              <span>An official Call of Duty board game has been announced.


Activision and Arcane Wonders released a teaser video, below, that doesn&#x27;t tell us much of anything about &quot;Call of Duty: The Board Game&quot;, but the official blurb helps a bit.


&quot;Get ready for the ultimate Call of Duty tabletop experience! We&#x27;re excited to announce the upcoming release of Call of Duty: The Board Game, a thrilling new strategy game based on the popular video game franchise.

                              <span>It looks like Lego is set to release a Pac-Man arcade machine model this summer. 


Images of the set have been making the rounds online, and while the pictures in question are admittedly very blurry, they appear to show the upper half of a Pac-Man cabinet. Along with the cabinet half itself, there also seem to be Lego models of Pac-Man and two small ghosts. 


While nothing has been officially announced, according to Lego leaker Falconbricks, this set will be released on 1st June and sell for $269.99 (so, around £217). Meanwhile, it is said to have 2651 pieces.

In a recent management update, Guerrilla announced that its studio director and executive producer Angie Smets was set to start a new role at PlayStation Studios, as head of development strategy.


Along with the customary words of appreciation for Smets&#x27; work at the company, Guerrilla also laid out the groundwork for its new look management team.

The UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is one of three key regulators around the world still scrutinising Microsoft&#x27;s deal, alongside the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU&#x27;s European Commission. 


A final ruling by the CMA must arrive before the end of its deadline day - this Wednesday, 26th April - and Microsoft has recently had reason to hope its efforts to win over the UK authority will ultimately prove successful.

This patch addresses a number of issues, and can generally be seen as a very good thing. After all, we all want our games to look and play as smooth as possible. 

If you are one of the many trying to speedrun your way through the game, I&#x27;m afraid this may now be a little harder, as this update has &#x27;fixed&#x27; the glitch that allowed players to warp through walls when using the scope in certain areas. This means no more shortcutting your way through doors. Welp!

LawBreakers was a hero shooter developed by Boss Key Productions, the now defunct studio set up by Cliff &quot;CliffyB&quot; Bleszinski after he left Epic having famously worked on the Unreal Tournament and Gears of War franchises.


Despite a big pre-release push by publisher Nexon, LawBreakers flopped, with its Steam concurrent player count peaking at 7482 in June 2017 when it launched via open beta. Nexon later blamed LawBreakers&#x27; disastrous fortunes on battle royale PUBG, which at the time was just about the biggest game in the world.

                              <span>Ubisoft has said it is unlikely to launch native PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2, as taking &quot;full advantage&quot; of the current console generation would also mean leaving players on PS4 and Xbox One behind.

The Division 2 originally launched back in March 2019, with versions for PS4, Xbox One and PC. Streaming versions for Google Stadia and Amazon Luna launched in 2020, and it is playable now on new consoles via backwards compatibility.

Last week, The Division 2&#x27;s fifth year of content was laid out for fans of Ubisoft&#x27;s ongoing post-pandemic co-op shooter. Speaking to MP1st, the game&#x27;s creative director Yannick Banchereau also discussed whether a ground-up PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version could also release - but it seems unlikely.

                              <span>Lili is confirmed as a playable character in Tekken 8.


Bandai Namco released the gameplay video, below, that shows off Lili&#x27;s look in the upcoming fighting game.

The pampered Monégasque heiress makes the playable character cut complete with a Siamese cat named Salt. In the video, we see Lili square off against rival Asuka, who was confirmed for Tekken 8 a few weeks ago. In her new rage art, Lili counts to three while knocking lumps out of her opponent, before saying adieu with a somersault kick.

                              <span>In an open letter, seven secure messaging apps—including Signal and WhatsApp—point out that the UK’s Online Safety Bill could destroy end-to-end encryption:
As currently drafted, the Bill could break end-to-end encryption,opening the door to routine, general and indiscriminate surveillance of personal messages of friends, family members, employees, executives, journalists, human rights activists and even politicians themselves, which would fundamentally undermine everyone’s ability to communicate securely.
The Bill provides no explicit protection for encryption, and if implemented as written, could empower OFCOM to try to force the proactive scanning of private messages on end-to-end encrypted communication services – nullifying the purpose of end-to-end encryption as a result and compromising the privacy of all users...</span>

Before Kubernetes v1.8 (!), typos, mis-indentations or minor errors in
YAMLs could have catastrophic consequences (e.g. a typo like
forgetting the trailing s in replica: 1000 could cause an outage,
because the value would be ignored and missing, forcing a reset of
replicas back to 1). This was solved back then by fetching the OpenAPI
v2 in kubectl and using it to verify that fields were correct and
present before applying. Unfortunately, at that time, Custom Resource
Definitions didn’t exist, and the code was written under that
assumption. When CRDs were later introduced, the lack of flexibility
in the validation code forced some hard decisions in the way CRDs

                              <span>A Resident Evil 4 fan has made a real-life recreation of Leon Kennedy&#x27;s attache case to show how Leon&#x27;s items would &quot;scale in real life&quot;.

The recreation – which takes a screenshot of a late-game Kennedy loadout as its source – is fantastically faithful, including eggs, a &quot;fish&quot;, guns with their attachments, as well as ammo and health items, and suggests that in real life, the case that holds Leon&#x27;s inventory would be prohibtively enormous.

You can check out the fantastic photograph – which was shared on Reddit – right here (thanks, TheGamer):

                              <span>It looks like physical copies of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will require an additional digital download to play.

Whilst there&#x27;s been no formal word from EA about the additional requirement, players who&#x27;ve spotted the physical game out in the wild have reportedly noticed that the boxed copies sport a sticker on the front that says &quot;download required&quot;.

This may not come as a surprise to some given EA recently published the minimum and recommended PC specifications for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which stated that Jedi Survivor takes up 155GB on PC, and discs can only hold so much data, of course.

The initiative – which &quot;instructs loved-ones to both zombie-proof the recently deceased and toast their passing with a blowout in Los Angeles before the city becomes the Hell-A we see in the game&quot; – is an insurance policy to provide &quot;a wake to end all wakes with nearest and dearest raising a Zombie cocktail during a celebratory Californian getaway&quot;.

They include notes and annotations handwritten by Barone that intimate how he expected players to interact with the different characters and items in the game.

&quot;[I] was going through some things and found my old notebook with the original community centre concept,&quot; Barone tweeted, before sharing wonderful sketches taken from his original notebook.

As the &quot;unshielded&quot; name suggests, players forego both helmets or shields and race to become the first to clock up 50 kills and &quot;prove themselves a Champion among Legends&quot;.

&quot;There’s been so much happening in the world of Wild Hearts recently,&quot; the team explains. &quot;We deployed a PC crash hotfix and a Claw Blade &amp; Bow Rebalance patch last week. So much to share and we haven’t even gotten to what&#x27;s in today&#x27;s content update!&quot;

&quot;Deathhaze Gloombeak soars into Akikure Canyon, along with a new title and a new talisman skill for those able to reach new heights as a hunter.

                              <span>Four more Ubisoft games are slated to join Steam later this year.

Far Cry 6, Riders Republic, Rainbow Six Extraction, and Monopoly Madness are set to come to the Steam store on 11th May, 8th June, 15th June, and 22nd June, respectively, marking the first time these titles will be playable on Steam.

Since 2019, Ubisoft had skipped bringing its game to Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12 per cent revenue cut compared to Valve&#x27;s 30 per cent.

                              <span>The Mortuary Assistant is now available on Nintendo Switch.

The smash-hit indie horror hit – which offers some genuinely unsettling moments in its 10ish hour run time over numerous playthroughs – doesn&#x27;t seem to boast any Switch-specific features, but it does mark the first time the chilling creeper is available outside of Steam.

&quot;Having completed your degree in mortuary sciences, you have taken on an apprenticeship at River Fields Mortuary. Over the past several months you have logged many hours aiding the Mortician in daily tasks along with learning the ins and outs of the embalming process as well as how to properly handle and care for the deceased,&quot; teases the description on the Nintendo Shop.

                              <span>Sons of the Forest roared out the gates when it launched into Steam early access back in February, and 2m+ copies sold later, developer Endnight Games is continuing to improve the experience, this time adding ducks, a lake to put them in, a double log buff for fan-favourite companion Kelvin, and a sad end for a levitating life jacket.


All this comes via Sons of the Forest&#x27;s patch #4, which, while fairly light on radical new features, brings a host of welcome quality of life improvements - including the aforementioned Kelvin buff meaning he can now carry a whopping two logs at once - plus tweaks, and more. 


There&#x27;s some new stuff on the feature front, though, including a new Action Cam used to view Sons of the Forest&#x27;s found footage tapes - the first of which is now in-game - plus new points of interest discovery laptops, and the ability to name save games.

                              <span>Developers Massive Monster&#x27;s entertaining dungeon-crawling management sim Cult of the Lamb is getting a massive free update next Monday, 24th April, introducing a new post-game storylie, &quot;deeper&quot; combat, new building options, and more.


There&#x27;s a lot going on in Relics of the Old Faith, as the update is known, starting with the introduction of Relics and heavy attacks as part of Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s improved combat. It also adds remixed dungeons featuring revamped enemies and bosses, including new versions of the base game&#x27;s four Guardian Bishops as confirmed during Nintendo&#x27;s indie showcase.


Away from the dungeon-crawling side of things, Massive Monster says the game&#x27;s cult management portion will get new followers, plus a range of new buildings - including a kitchen with its own chef for more efficient cooking, a (non-collapsing) shared shelter capable of housing up to three followers, a crypt to keep graveyard sizes under control, plus farm plot signs which followers can plant stuff around for better crop organisation.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced Victoria 3&#x27;s first paid expansion, a new &quot;immersion pack&quot; titled Voice of the People, which launches on 22nd May.


Voice of the People&#x27;s main new feature is introduction of ideological &quot;agitators&quot; from across history, including Victor Hugo and Karl Marx. Agitators are a new kind of character in Victoria 3, capable of rallying pops to support political movements that align with their ideology.


&quot;Agitators will shake up your internal politics, acting independently of their Interest Groups,&quot; Paradox explains in a blog post accompanying its DLC announcement. &quot;Amplifying power from below, Agitators serve an opposite function to Interest Group Petitions which reflect the demands of the political elite. Depending on how your goals align with theirs, Agitators might be a painful thorn in your side or a valuable ally to your political agenda.&quot;

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s Aaron Greenberg has insisted Tango Gameworks&#x27; Hi-Fi Rush was a &quot;break out hit&quot; amid claims the critically acclaimed music adventure &quot;just didn&#x27;t make the money it needed to make&quot;.


The claim Hi-Fi Rush had failed to meet Microsoft&#x27;s financial expectations was made by Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb during his latest Game Mess Decides podcast.

&quot;Based on what I&#x27;ve heard,&quot; Grubb said during a conversation about the game&#x27;s release strategy, &quot;it just straight up didn&#x27;t make the money it needed to make. I mean it got good reviews, the buzz was good, so where do you put the blame for something like that? Is it the price? Was it the shadow drop? Could it have sold more? Or is it Game Pass?&quot;.

                              <span>Darker and Darker&#x27;s lawyer has accused Korean gaming company Nexon of &quot;anti-competitive bully tactics&quot;, in a letter to Steam owner Valve. 


Following positive reception at Steam Next Fest earlier this year, Dark and Darker has experienced a troubled production. In March, developer Ironmace had its office searched, after Nexon alleged the studio created its game with code stolen from Nexon&#x27;s own &quot;P3&quot; project (something several members of Ironmace&#x27;s team had previously worked on). 


Soon after these allegations were made, Nexon issued Ironmace with a cease and desist demand, and Dark and Darker was removed from Steam. Most recently, it came to light that the Dark and Darker developer is being sued by Nexon for &quot;copyright infringement&quot;, with the Korean game publisher demanding a jury trial in America.

&quot;You can still share your favourite moments to Twitter via the Xbox app for Android and iOS,&quot; Microsoft assured users last night while sharing this news. 


In a recent update, Microsoft additionally revealed that, starting on 25th April, its &quot;Smart Campaigns with Multi-platform will no longer support Twitter&quot;.

Earlier this week, World of Warcraft producer Adam &quot;Glaxigrav&quot; took to Twitter to voice opinions on how Blizzard is &quot;losing amazing talent because someone in power doesn&#x27;t listen to the game directors who make his products&quot;.


He added: &quot;DE&amp;I [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] also means diversity of thought, especially when it&#x27;s backed by data and financials&quot;.

                              <span>Valve has released a significant update to its MOBA Dota 2, called New Frontiers.


It expands the map and makes meaningful gameplay, matchmaking and user interface changes, among many other things.

While the core objectives of the game are the same, with lanes the same distance from each other and win objectives still in the centre of the map, there&#x27;s 40 percent more terrain, which means there&#x27;s loads of room to gather resources.

                              <span>Atari has whipped out its wallet and snapped up the intellectual property rights to over 100 retro games from the 80s and 90s, including Bubsy, Demolition Racer, and more.


Specifically, Atari&#x27;s new acquisitions span the PC and console game catalogues of publishers Micropose, Infogrames, Accolade, with Atari also now owning the Accolade trademark.


Sadly, the company hasn&#x27;t shared a full list of the retro IP it now owns after its most recent splurge, so there&#x27;ll be no time for lengthy bouts of nostalgia here - but its announcement did at least call out the aforementioned Bubsy and Demolition Racer, alongside Hardball, 1942: Pacific Air War, F-117A, and F-14 air combat series.

Firewalk was founded in 2018 as a subsidiary of ProbablyMonsters and is yet to release its first game. However, the studio announced a partnership with Sony in 2021 to create a new PlayStation-exclusive triple-A title focused on delivering &quot;memorable multiplayer moments&quot;.


In a PlayStation Blog post announcing the acquisition, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst explained it was Firewalk&#x27;s work on its still mysterious title - a project being headed by former Destiny creative director Ryan Ellis - that lead Sony to acquire the developer.

                              <span>Dazzlingly chaotic crowd puzzler Humanity, which is being developed by Tokyo game studio THA in collaboration Tetris Effect developer Enhance, will be tumbling onto PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC on 16th May, and it&#x27;ll be a day one PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue addition too.


Humanity, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, has been in development for a fair old while, with THA first showcasing the game back in 2017 before it re-emerged two years later with Enhance attached. It&#x27;s remained an intriguing proposition throughout its journey, challenging players - in the role of a Shiba Inu - to corral huge, purposeless crowds.


There&#x27;s a vague air of classic puzzler Lemmings about the whole thing as players let out a &quot;woof&quot; to control Humanity&#x27;s vast swarms, making the crowds move, change direction, jump, float, or even fight in order to navigate Trials packed with traps and obstacles, and overcome enemies known as the Others.

Originally announced in May 2021, Heartland has now been in closed testing for over a year already - but there&#x27;s evidently still more to be done before it gets a final launch date. 


Tonight, Ubisoft directed interested players and their parties to register for access (at thedivisionheartland.com) in a fresh round of testing, ahead of &quot;more news this summer&quot;.

                              <span>Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn has reportedly been heavily affected by the latest round of job cuts at Meta Quest and VR owner Meta, with one employee claiming a third of the studio has been laid off, including the studio head.


As originally reported by The Washington Post, today&#x27;s layoffs could affect as many as 4,000 employees at Meta, and are part of the company&#x27;s stated goal of cutting a further 10,000 jobs in 2023 following the 11,000 job losses announced last year.


The Washington Post claims Meta has targeted &quot;highly skilled staff&quot; - including engineers and other technical workers - in its latest round of layoffs, and, since its report, employees have said both Ready at Dawn and fellow Meta acquisition Downpour Interactive have been impacted.

Apple introduced the optional recovery key in 2020 to protect users from online hackers. Users who turn on the recovery key, a unique 28-digit code, must provide it when they want to reset their Apple ID password.
iPhone thieves with your passcode can flip on the recovery key and lock you out. And if you already have the recovery key enabled, they can easily generate a new one, which also locks you out.
Apple’s policy gives users virtually no way back into their accounts without that recovery key. For now, a stolen iPhone could mean devastating personal losses...</span>

Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature called Node log query that allows
viewing logs of services running on the node.
What problem does it solve?
Cluster administrators face issues when debugging malfunctioning services
running on the node. They usually have to SSH or RDP into the node to view the
logs of the service to debug the issue. The Node log query feature helps with
this scenario by allowing the cluster administrator to view the logs using
kubectl. This is especially useful with Windows nodes where you run into the
issue of the node going to the ready state but containers not coming up due to
CNI misconfigurations and other issues that are not easily identifiable by
looking at the Pod status.
How does it work?

                              <span>Spooky visual novel Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is steeped in Japanese history. When you&#x27;re not absorbing the sights of 1980s Tokyo or hearing ancient folk tales, Paranormasight feeds you bits of information about Japan during the wider Shōwa era and the earlier Edo period.


Whether from decades or centuries ago, elements of Japanese history are woven into the game, something which Paranormasight director and writer Takaya Ishiyama told me more about, in a discussion which revealed more about the team&#x27;s approach to using history in the game&#x27;s narrative as a way to balance realism and mystery.


One of the first things you notice when playing Paranormasight is the difference in visual style between the environments and the characters. The game&#x27;s cast were drawn by Kobayashi Gen, and his distinct style stands out from the surroundings in-game. The 360-degree panoramas you explore were all created from photographs, though this wasn&#x27;t initially what the team set out to do.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast it&#x27;s all about Zelda, and the many burning questions we still have surrounding the upcoming Tears of the Kingdom. 

Despite all the details to be found in Nintendo&#x27;s final Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer, there&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know.  How much has changed in Hyrule since Breath of the Wild, and how many new areas are there to explore? Are there proper dungeons in the game this time around? What are the Tears of the Kingdom? 
With less than a month until launch, it&#x27;s time for one final round of theorising - as the internet begins to entertain some wild theories that Ganon is actually good, or maybe just pulling a Thanos. Joining me to discuss it all - and place bets on whether Zelda really is playable - are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Activision issued an update to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Warzone 2.0 and DMZ overnight that includes an interesting gameplay change the community reckons is a response to a backlash over pay-to-win bundles.


Last week, Season 3 of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 went live alongside a bundle that includes controversial &quot;bonus effects&quot; for the extraction mode, DMZ.

For example, the Classic Ghost Pack, which costs 2400 CP, includes a free two-plate armour vest, a 15-minute insured weapon cooldown for each of the two guns included in the bundle, and adds one more active duty operator slot for DMZ.

                              <span>Cast your minds back to October last year and you may recall footage doing the rounds of a self-proclaimed &quot;body cam-style&quot; game that looked almost too realistic to actually be real - if you know what I mean.


However, fast forward six months and we now have an official trailer for the game. It&#x27;s called Unrecord, and comes from a developer known simply as Drama.


Unrecord is described as a &quot;single-player FPS that tells the story of a tactical police officer from the perspective of his body camera&quot;. You can see how it looks for yourself below - and its realism makes for slightly uncomfortable viewing.

For the first time, high quality scans of the artwork are being shared with the Pokémon community in the hopes of archiving them.

The drawings depict the first 251 Pokémon to appear in the games and were uploaded by YouTuber and Pokémon archivist LewTwo to Twitter. The scans were sent to Lewtwo by Twitter user ExcaliburZero_Z.

The old scans are believed to have originated from the Pokémon Red and Blue Player&#x27;s Guide, Lewtwo explained, where they ended up with &quot;inaccurate colors, were often misshapen, and generally very low quality&quot;.

Please note, there are spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


During the events of Burning Shores, Aloy meets Seyka, an &quot;ambitious marine of the Quen tribe who has stepped up to help her people survive&quot;. Ahead of the DLC&#x27;s release, Seyka was touted as a character that would be Aloy&#x27;s equal, with actress Ashley Birch even saying &quot;Aloy may have met her match&quot;.

Season of the Deep, out 23rd May, will include an option for players to amend the Enemy Targeted Reticle Colour that changes when aiming at an enemy, as well as new colour options for subtitles to ensure they&#x27;re easy to read.


Bungie is also adding colour presets for Commendations, meaning players with colour blindness can still clearly see rewards.

In a blog post earlier this week, Cathcart&#x27;s wife Martha made the announcement after revealing Cathcart&#x27;s tumours weren&#x27;t responding to initial chemotherapy &quot;as much as was anticipated&quot;.

                              <span>A Mario character who appears in the new Super Mario Bros. Movie will be re-named in Japan, Nintendo has confirmed. 


Mario and Luigi&#x27;s former boss Spike appears in the film as a stern foreman and rival for the brothers&#x27; new firm. The character is a deep cut from Mario canon, and originally appeared in the NES and arcade game Wrecking Crew back in the 1980s.


In Japan, Spike has always had the name &quot;Blackie&quot; - which for obvious reasons will no longer be used. Henceforth, the character will be re-named as &quot;Spike&quot; in any future appearances, and the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie will use &quot;Spike&quot; as well.

                              <span>Blizzard has teased a new Diablo 4 beta ahead of the action role-playing game&#x27;s 6th June launch.


Quote tweeting a Twitter user&#x27;s call for more Diablo 4 game time, the official Diablo Twitter account said: &quot;That can be arranged…&quot;


That&#x27;s a pretty clear tease that some surprise way to play Diablo 4 ahead of release is planned. Whether that&#x27;s a fresh open beta or early access remains to be seen. If you pre-order Diablo 4 you currently get early access from 2nd June, so this tweet suggests something even earlier.

                              <span>Epic Games has gripped another studio in a permanent money hug, this time acquiring Horizon Chase Turbo developer Aquiris to work on Fortnite.


The Brazil-based Aquiris was founded in 2007 and went on to develop the well-received Wonderbox: The Adventure Maker and Looney Tunes World of Mayhem for mobile, as well as its retro-inspired arcade racer Horizon Chase which released in 2015.


A much-expanded - and critically acclaimed - follow-up, Horizon Chase Turbo, arrived in 2018, whisking the series from mobile to PC and consoles, and Aquiris launched a third entry in the series, Horizon Chase 2, on Apple Arcade at the end of last year.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been quite some time since The Game Kitchen announced it was working on a sequel to its gorgeous, gothic action-platformer Blasphemous, but now - with a release pencilled in for &quot;late summer&quot; 2023 - we&#x27;ve been given a first trailer for Blasphemous 2.


The original Blasphemous released back in 2019 to well-deserved acclaim, delivering a rock-solid 2D Metroidvania-meets-Souls-like that married a lavishly presented world of dark religious iconography, monsters, and encroaching madness with some truly unsettling baroque imagery.


In its upcoming sequel, Blasphemous&#x27; original pointy hatted protagonist The Penitent One returns for another adventure - tying into the first game&#x27;s Wounds of Eventide update ending - set across a strange new labyrinthine land ravaged by a curse known as The Miracle.

Announced back in 2021 and initially expected to launch that same year, Oxenfree 2 is set five years after the memorable, dimension-shattering events of the original game. This time around, the story focuses on new protagonist Riley Poverly, an environmental researcher who returns to her small coastal hometown of Camena which, as you might already have guessed, is being plagued by mysterious radio signals.


Making matters worse, there&#x27;s a cult on the loose, attempting to open a portal between worlds, but Riley has some useful new tricks to help her investigations. A new walkie talkie, for instance, means communiucation can occur between characters all across Camena even when they&#x27;re not together, with conversation and dialogue choices affecting how events play out.

One interesting bit is that Apple’s Lockdown Mode (part of iOS 16) seems to have worked to prevent infection.

With the release of Kubernetes v1.27 the ReadWriteOncePod feature has graduated
to beta. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll take a closer look at this feature, what it
does, and how it has evolved in the beta release.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is a new access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.

                              <span>The Day Before developer Fntastic has re-emerged with news of a beta test for its highly-anticipated but held-up zombie MMO, ahead of a full release on 10th November. 


As a reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release in March, before its launch was delayed. In a bizarre series of events, it transpired that Fntastic had failed to trademark the game&#x27;s name, which had since been contested by the company behind a calendar app. All traces of the game were subsequently removed from Steam and since then, very little has been heard at all.


The Day Before has now reemerged, however, with word from an administrator on the game&#x27;s official Discord that a beta is now in the pipeline.

                              <span>Capcom has detailed the additions coming to Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak - including weather-manipulating elder dragon Amatsu - as part of the expansion&#x27;s free April update, and has confirmed there&#x27;ll be one final free update arriving in June.


Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Title Update 5 (also referred to as Version 15) launches tomorrow, 20th April, and its flagship new arrival is the Looming Calamity, better known as the elder dragon Amatsu. This formidable creature can control the weather, conjuring violent storms and lightning strikes once it shows its true power, and is available to hunters at MR 10 or higher.


Amatsu is accompanied by Title Update 5&#x27;s second creature addition, a powerful Risen variant Shagaru Magala, which becomes available at MR 180 or higher. As you&#x27;d expect, new equipment can be forged from the materials dropped by both creatures, including a fetching bit of Palamute outfit resembling floating armoured horse.

                              <span>A Pokémon fan has created an impressive HD-2D take on the series&#x27; original Game Boy games.


Several videos made by 3D pixel artist and designer Dott have surfaced in the past week, showing off what Pokémon Red might look like if reimagined in an HD-2D style similar to recent Square Enix titles like Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler. 


It&#x27;s a design which has sparked excitement from fans at how future Pokémon remakes could be made, after the rather lacklustre response to 2021&#x27;s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and more general gripes about the series&#x27; visuals in all-new entries.

So, here are some of the current Tears of the Kingdom theories out there. (Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.)

                              <span>Guerrilla has released a new patch for Horizon Forbidden West which adds a range of new accessibility features - including one designed for those who suffer from thalassophobia.


Thalassophobia is classed as the persistent and intense fear of deep bodies of water, including the sea, oceans and even lakes. It is different from aquaphobia, which is a fear of water itself.


According to Guerrilla, this option aims to ease a player&#x27;s thalassophobia by &quot;improving underwater ambient visibility&quot;. Additionally, Aloy will be able to breathe indefinitely when under the water &quot;regardless of story progression&quot;.

The exuberant Jack Black ballad, in character as Bowser, is a highight of the film, and the catchiest movie track since Encanto&#x27;s Bruno. I even heard it being chanted by the younger viewers around me as I left the cinema. 


It&#x27;s also now hit the US song charts as well, and has marked Black&#x27;s first solo entry in the Billboard Hot 100. On YouTube, meanwhile, the song&#x27;s music video has racked up 17m views in 11 days. Let&#x27;s watch:

                              <span>Ubisoft may extend the XDefiant closed beta over its &quot;horrible&quot; server experience.


Executive producer Mark Rubin took to Twitter to say Ubisoft will discuss the possibility of extending the closed beta, which is due to end on 23rd April.


Ubisoft has issued a raft of updates to the beta in a bid to improve the experience. My own time with the game on PlayStation 5 has been beset with technical issues that have forced me to restart in order to get a match. Ubisoft reacted to progression problems by unlocking everything for all players.

Sci-fi sidescroller Pulseman, an early project from Pokémon developer Game Freak, is also now available to try. It&#x27;s set in the &quot;far future of 2015&quot;, which I&#x27;d like to go back to.

Playdate was initially announced back in 2019, promising a unique (and dinkily adorable) spin on portable gaming that would see Panic teaming up with a host of noted indie game designers - including the likes of Zach Gage and Bennett Foddy - to produce a curated 24-game &quot;season&quot;, as well as offering itch.io sideloading support and, more recently, an on-device store.


It was a pitch that clearly captured peoples&#x27; imaginations; Panic has now revealed the initial 20,000 Playdate units it produced based on its early sales predictions sold out within 20 minutes of the device being made available to purchase via a queue system last April.

Proceedings are set to commence at 7pm BST/8pm CEST/11am PDT this Thursday via Twitch and YouTube, with Ubisoft promising news on three of its The Division games.


Up first is the still-popular The Division 2, which will share more on its upcoming rogue-like-inspired Descent mode, alongside details of its Year 5 plans. Ubisoft, you might recall, confirmed a fifth year of content would be happening last July.

                              <span>EFF has a good explainer on the problems with the new UN Cybercrime Treaty, currently being negotiated in Vienna.
The draft treaty has the potential to rewrite criminal laws around the world, possibly adding over 30 criminal offenses and new expansive police powers for both domestic and international criminal investigations.

While we don’t think the U.N. Cybercrime Treaty is necessary, we’ve been closely scrutinizing the process and providing constructive analysis. We’ve made clear that human rights must be baked into the proposed treaty so that it doesn’t become a tool to ...</span>

The problem
On Linux with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled, it&#x27;s traditionally
the container runtime that applies SELinux labels to a Pod and all its volumes.
Kubernetes only passes the SELinux label from a Pod&#x27;s securityContext fields
to the container runtime.
The container runtime then recursively changes SELinux label on all files that
are visible to the Pod&#x27;s containers. This can be time-consuming if there are
many files on the volume, especially when the volume is on a remote filesystem.
Note
subPath of a volume, only that subPath of the whole
volume is relabeled. This allows two pods that have two different SELinux labels
to use the same volume, as long as they use different subpaths of it.

If a Pod does not have any SELinux label assigned in …</span>

With spring now in full swing, green-fingered sorts will have the seasonally appropriate opporunity to fashion their own horticultural hangouts as part of The Sims 4&#x27;s new Greenhouse Haven Kit. This introduces glass pane windows and doors that can be connected to create new garden spaces, as well as a range of items to go inside - including hanging baskets, starter seedlings, a planting table, and range of pots.


Alternatively, for those who&#x27;d prefer to hide away from the sun&#x27;s rays in grungy comfort, there&#x27;s the Basement Treasures Kit, offering a selection of hand-me-down inspired furnishings. Expect the likes of worn and torn chairs and couches, crates of vinyl records, old trophies and family photos, battered chests, and  even an old cathode-ray tube TV.

Now, by run, I mean actual running. One foot in front of the other and all that. And to add that extra layer of adventure and excitement, the app &#x27;gamifies&#x27; your run by popping Marvel&#x27;s heroes in your ear as they join you via the app&#x27;s interactive stories. That said, you can also walk or jog (or perhaps even trot) your way through the storylines if you prefer.

From today, players will be able to get their hands on Minecraft Legends - &quot;The piglins are threatening to consume the Overworld. Are you the hero this gentle land needs?&quot; Microsoft asks. 


In her Minecraft Legends review, Caelyn Ellis said that while the series&#x27; iconic &quot;blocky charm is present and correct&quot;, she felt that the rest of the game was &quot;only as deep as the skins it wants to sell you&quot;. She did, however, like the piglins.

                              <span>Multiple Mario games have seen their position in the UK boxed charts climb following the success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie (which is now the biggest video game adaptation ever). Perhaps this isn&#x27;t a huge surprise - after all, when I saw the film over the weekend, several Switch game trailers played before the movie began, including one for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


Mario Kart 8: Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey and New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe all made the UK physical chart top 10 this week, with Mario Kart 8: Deluxe currently sitting at number two, only behind Fifa 23. This is a climb of two places for Nintendo&#x27;s racer, which has seen a nine percent increase in sales week-on-week (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz)


As for the other two, Super Mario Odyssey jumped from tenth to fifth position this week, while New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe climbed from 17 to ten.

Screenshots and file details suggest a major in-game event is planned ahead of Doctor Who&#x27;s upcoming 60th anniversary later this year.


Initial details shared last week by prolific Fortnite leaker iFireMonkey included word of a two-week event with free cosmetic rewards, and additional items available to buy.

                              <span>Blizzard has confirmed it has &quot;no plans&quot; for a Diablo 4 tab overlay map.


The &quot;Automap&quot; tool is a feature of the previous Diablo games. In Diablo 1 and 2 it appears as a faint overlay in the middle of the screen. Diablo 3 shifted the overlay map to the top right-hand corner of the screen, making it more of a mini-map.


Diablo 4, however, has a dedicated mini-map on the top-right corner of the screen, with the tab button used to display the full map and journal. The game will not have a tab overlay map as seen in Diablo 1 and 2, Diablo chief Rod Fergusson confirmed on Twitter.

                              <span>Those on base Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles will not be able to host a co-op session on Dead Island 2&#x27;s release. Instead, they will have to rely on players with more recent consoles (from the same console family) to be the host. 


In a recent blog, developer Dambuster Studios stated that, due to Dead Island 2&#x27;s graphic requirements, &quot;the host must play on the latest generation console (PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X S) or one of the Generation 8+ consoles (PlayStation 4 Pro/Xbox One X)&quot;. The host can then be joined by up to two more players. 


As such, those on original PS4 and Xbox One consoles will not be able to host a session on the game&#x27;s launch. The developer is working on a solution for this, with the plan being that everyone playing Dead Island 2 will eventually be able to host a session, regardless of console. Dambuster has not given a timeframe for this update as yet, merely stating it is planned to come &quot;in the future&quot;.

                              <span>Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser has been freed from prison, but will remain in debt to the company for the rest of his life.


In February 2022, Bowser was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices. He pleaded guilty and agreed to a $4.5m fine, plus an additional $10m fine to settle Nintendo&#x27;s own civil lawsuit against him.


Speaking to podcaster Nick Moses (via Kotaku), Bowser explained that Nintendo is now able to recoup 25-30 percent of his personal income for the rest of his working life.

                              <span>Bungie has tried to draw a line under the recent controversy surrounding a Destiny 2 community member accused of leaking upcoming game details.


In a fresh statement shared via Twitter, the studio stated it had &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; including &quot;video recordings, verified messages and images&quot; regarding an individual who has leaked privileged information shared over the course of &quot;multiple years&quot;. 


The issue first came to light last week, when Bungie said it had suffered a &quot;breach of trust&quot; after identifying a leaker amongst the small group of community members it sometimes invited to its studio to provide feedback on the game and share upcoming plans.

Monster Hunter Now is set to fully launch in September 2023, but will roll out in closed beta form starting 25th April - which you can sign up for at MonsterHunterNow.com.

                              <span>Having teased the introduction of difficulty modifiers to its viking survival game Valheim back in January, developer Iron Gate Studio has now offered a first look at the feature&#x27;s progress.


Word that Iron Gate was looking to introduce difficulty settings to Valheim first came as part of an very early glimpse at the game&#x27;s upcoming Ashlands biome. And now, three months on, development has reached a point where the studio is able to share more.


As detailed by Iron Gate&#x27;s Jonathan Smårs on Twitter, Valheim&#x27;s difficulty settings will take the form of both pre-set and customisable &quot;world modifiers&quot;. Some you&#x27;d expect - Easy, Hard, and Hardcore variations are all present and correct, for instance, impacting combat difficulty, the frequency of enemy raids on player bases, and items kept on death - but Iron Gate is throwing in a number of more unusual presets too.

                              <span>A French court has sided with Nintendo in an appeal launched by filehosting website operator Dstorarge, which was previously ordered to pay €935,500 (around £826k) after it refused to withdraw access to pirated Nintendo games.


Nintendo initially took legal action against Dstorarge after it ignored copyright notifications demanding it remove illegal copies of Nintendo games hosted on its 1fichier service. The Judicial Court of Paris ultimately ruled in Nintendo&#x27;s favour, saying filehosting services such as 1fichier were responsible for blocking access to pirated content and ordering Dstorage pay the Mario maker €935,500 in damages.


Dstorage, in turn, launched an appeal against the ruling, and, two years on, that appeal has now failed. The Paris Court of Appeals has once again sided with Nintendo, ordering Dstorage to pay the company €442,750 (£391k) in compensation, plus €25,000 (£22k) to cover legal fees.

                              <span>Following news of his departure from Microsoft earlier this month, former Halo Infinite creative head Joseph Staten has joined Netflix to begin work on a &quot;AAA multiplatform&quot; game.


Staten has been closely associated with the Halo series since 2000, serving in various roles across both Bungie and 343 Industries. He started out as writer and director of cinematics for Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2, and would become Halo Infinite&#x27;s head of creative in 2020.


Word of his departure from 343 Industries arrived in January, amid extensive layoffs at Xbox Studios, when it was reported he would remain at Microsoft in a creative director role. Earlier this month, however, Staten confirmed he had now left Microsoft entirely, only saying he was preparing to embark on a &quot;new adventure&quot;.

                              <span>I’m not sure there are good ways to build guardrails to prevent this sort of thing:
There is growing concern regarding the potential misuse of molecular machine learning models for harmful purposes. Specifically, the dual-use application of models for predicting cytotoxicity18 to create new poisons or employing AlphaFold2 to develop novel bioweapons has raised alarm. Central to these concerns are the possible misuse of large language models and automated experimentation for dual-use purposes or otherwise. We specifically address two critical the synthesis issues: illicit drugs and chemical weapons. To evaluate these risks, we designed a test set comprising compounds from the DEA’s Schedule I and II substances and a list of known chemical weapon agents. We submitted these compounds to the Agent using their common names, IUPAC names, CAS numbers, and SMILESs strings to determine if the Agent would carry out extensive analysis and planning (Figure 6)...</span>

                              <span>Media Molecule co-founder Mark Healey has left the studio after 17 years.


Healey co-founded Media Molecule in 2006 in Guildford alongside Kareem Ettouney, Alex Evans and David Smith, after working at Fable developer Lionhead (and creating Rag Doll Kung Fu, the first non-Valve game on Steam). Media Molecule&#x27;s first game was 2008 PlayStation 3 user-generated content platformer LittleBigPlanet, which did well enough that Sony bought the company two years later in 2010.


Healey went on to work on 2011&#x27;s LittleBigPlanet 2, 2013&#x27;s Tearaway and, most recently, PlayStation 4 game Dreams.

                              <span>Blizzard has revealed some of the changes it&#x27;s making to Diablo 4 following the recent beta playtests, and from what I can see, it&#x27;s addressing the biggest concerns I believe people had.
One of those was boredom with dungeons, particularly in having to traipse back and forth across them. &quot;One of the most common pieces of feedback we received is that players felt they were doing a lot of backtracking within certain dungeons,&quot; the company said in a blog post. &quot;We have optimised multiple dungeons across all zones to minimise the need for backtracking.&quot;
In Fractured Peaks alone - the zone in the demo - nine dungeons have had their layouts changed. And wherever a dungeon has an objective, especially one you have to carry around, there are now movement speed buffs as well as other enhancements to keep the pace up.

The wonderful Tetris Effect: Connected is one of the games leaving by the end of April. I&#x27;ve had this one on my Xbox Series S for what feels like forever. Now it&#x27;s finally time to decide whether to buy it (yes, of course I will!).


Other games leaving Game Pass are Dragon Quest Builders 2, Destroy All Humans!, Unsouled, and Bugsnax.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 is set to release this Friday (21st April), but its first 30 minutes are already viewable online, via a  streamer who managed to get hold of their copy of the game early. 

Lucas Cosmico streamed the game last night, with the first 30 minutes still up on YouTube at the time of writing. 


Without going into too much detail, the footage shows Dead Island 2&#x27;s opening sequence and cinematics. There&#x27;s some general (and to be honest, expected) blood and gore. The stream also shows off some of the game&#x27;s user interfaces and locations.

                              <span>Naughty Dog has released another update for The Last of Us Part 1 on PC, known as patch 1.0.3.


The developer has been doing its utmost to fix the game, which infamously released in an incredibly broken state earlier this year. In fact, Joel and Ellie quickly became memes on the PC game&#x27;s release, with the characters becoming inexplicably wet during cutscenes and, well, the eyebrow situation.

Since its PC launch, Naughty Dog along with Iron Galaxy has been steadily releasing patches to address things such as game crashes and various UI issues.

&quot;Capcom values diversity and inclusivity within its games and its community,&quot; the disclaimer notes. &quot;Please be aware the games in this collection may contain some cases of insensitive cultural depictions that are presented as originally created to preserve their authenticity.&quot;

                              <span>Prolific Zelda streamer and modder PointCrow has been hit by dozens of additional content claims and takedowns on his videos by Nintendo, in the run up to the release of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


PointCrow, who&#x27;s real name is Eric Morino, has seen several of his videos affected by Nintendo&#x27;s copyright claims recently, including ones pertaining to his Breath of the Wild multiplayer mod. Needless to say, he is not happy about it.  


PointCrow recently released a video about the various claims and takedowns on his channel (a video which he said was vetted by his lawyer before its release).

                              <span>Nexon is suing Ironmace, the developer behind medieval dungeon looter Dark and Darker, for &quot;copyright infringement&quot;. The Korean game publisher is now demanding a jury trial, as part of its ongoing dispute with Ironmace. 


This lawsuit was officially filed last Friday (14th April) at the US District Court for the Western District of Washington.


For a quick bit of background, the team at Ironmace was accused of creating Dark and Darker &quot;using materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at Nexon. These accusations specifically pertained to a game known as P3.

Sega Sammy Holdings is buying Finland-based Rovio for €706m (£625m). Sega expects the acquisition to close in the second quarter of the 2024 financial year, so by the end of September.

For Sega&#x27;s part, it reckons the mobile gaming market is projected to account for 56 percent of the global gaming market overall by 2026, so buying Rovio is an attempt to strenghten its position there.

iFireMonkey even thinks they know what the items will be, too; two skins, a Glider, and an Emote.

This means users are able to send messages of up to 20 minutes length to complement the existing ability to converse via voice chat. Right now, the ability to send messages is only available on the mobile version, although Discord says you can listen to your messages &quot;on any Discord platform&quot;.

For those wondering: yes, you can disable the ability to receive voice messages on your server via the Server Settings &gt; Roles menu, although there&#x27;s no specific word on how individual users can disable the facility.

Known as “Torswats” on the messaging app Telegram, the swatter has been calling in bomb and mass shooting threats against highschools and other locations across the country.

In Kubernetes v1.19, Pod topology spread constraints
went to general availability (GA).
As time passed, we - SIG Scheduling - received feedback from users,
and, as a result, we&#x27;re actively working on improving the Topology Spread feature via three KEPs.
All of these features have reached beta in Kubernetes v1.27 and are enabled by default.
This blog post introduces each feature and the use case behind each of them.
KEP-3022: min domains in Pod Topology Spread
Pod Topology Spread has the maxSkew parameter to define the degree to which Pods may be unevenly distributed.

                              <span>Capcom has quietly removed raytracing from the Steam versions of both the Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 remakes.

Right now, no-one&#x27;s entirely sure why the feature has been removed, but whilst &quot;they are still DirectX 12&quot;, raytracing has disappeared - as has Dolby Atmos for the third remake, too.

The issue came to light when u/pmc64 popped up on the PC Gaming subreddit to say that &quot;Capcom removed raytracing&quot; from both games overnight, whilst someone else brought it to everyone&#x27;s attention on the Resident Evil 3 Steam community around the same time.

In a follow-up Q&amp;A posted to his Patreon page, McGee admitted that he was &quot;feeling the same pain and anger as many of you&quot; but said it was time for he and his fans &quot;to move on&quot;.

American McGee&#x27;s confirmed last week that his attempt to develop a third instalment in his fan-favourite Alice series &quot;is at an end&quot;.

To celebrate, the studio is encouraging players to retweet the message as many times as possible to secure some in-game goodies, and one participant is in line to win &quot;about&quot; $100.

In a statement posted to the studio&#x27;s social media channels, the company said it it was &quot;taking actions to reinforce its policies&quot; but if it couldn&#x27;t trust its carefully curated attendees, it &quot;could result in its inability to hold more summits&quot;. 

&quot;Community interaction and engagement is central to Bungie and our games,&quot; Bungie explained in a tweet. &quot;For years, we&#x27;ve invited creators and other members of the community to confidential summits to provide feedback on the future of Destiny. This is a beloved part of the process, but relies heavily on trust.

Burke shared a photo of herself at work today and three simple words - &quot;recording in progress&quot; - but it&#x27;s the accompanying photo of herself that&#x27;s garnered the most attention:

Further tweets, in which Burke writes, &quot;nothing beats working with good people. Nothing. Thanks for today Mason Lieberman (director) and Yusuke Mori (engineer) and Tomomi Ura (EA)&quot;, have also set tongues wagging, as eagle-eyed fans are convinced that the accompanying photographs include a sheet of the lyrics from Snake Eater&#x27;s main theme (thanks, PlayStation Lifestyle):

Stating that Gearbox boss &quot;Randy Pitchford [has created the] new Gearbox program to educate, inspire, and create&quot;, Gearbox says that the work &quot;encompasses Gearbox’s educational and philanthropic programs, and its community partnerships and initiatives&quot;.

&quot;Gearbox has been committed to using our platform and the power of entertainment for good since our founding, and Gearbox Gives is a continuation and expansion of that work,&quot; said Randy Pitchford, founder of both Gearbox Gives and Gearbox itself (although he stepped down as president in 2021).

                              <span>Farming Simulator is 15 years old.

&quot;What once started as a niche title for agricultural enthusiasts became a multi-million selling and family-friendly franchise for all gamers,&quot; explains developer and publisher Giants Software, calling its farming sim an &quot;internationally acclaimed simulation series&quot; and revealing that since the agriculture game first launched, 2.5 billion mods have been downloaded for the &quot;modding-friendly&quot; series.

&quot;Along the way, many milestones have been achieved, as the Anniversary Trailer shows: From cooperative multiplayer with Farming Simulator 2011 and the introduction of the portable entries of the series with Farming Simulator 2012, followed by console versions in 2013, over the creation of an official eSports league with Farming Simulator 19, up to cross-platform multiplayer with Farming Simulator 22.&quot;

In the latest TWAB post, the studio said that the issue had been &quot;a matter of extended conversations both internally and in the community&quot;, and was keen &quot;to strike the right balance between Bungie’s goal of simultaneously enabling everyone to enjoy our games and protecting our community&quot;.

&quot;Our community has grown increasingly frustrated by a form of cheating that uses third-party peripherals with the intent to manipulate the game client,&quot; the team said. &quot;These devices are plugged into a computer or console, where they can - for example - execute simple scripts or trick the game into giving you extra aim assist.

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably fair to say Daedelic Entertainment&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been a little divisive since its unveiling in 2019, and it likely won&#x27;t help that the developer has now announced it&#x27;s charging extra for anyone that wants to hear its elves speak in authentic Elvish.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, for the uninitiated, forges something of a unusual path through Middle-earth, taking its wide-eyed lead - already an unusual choice for a protagonist - on a pre-Lord of the Rings adventure combining &quot;subtle tactical stealth&quot; and &quot;fast-paced parkour action&quot;.


Perhaps a little oddly, given you&#x27;d think Daedelic would want to keep The Lord of the Rings fans firmly on its side, the developer has now announced those wanting to experience the adventure with more authentic elf voice acting &quot;in the Elvish tongue of Sindarin&quot; - an addition the developer is aiming at &quot;die-hard fans who want to immerse themselves even more while exploring the world of Tolkien&quot; - will need to cough up extra for Gollum&#x27;s Precious Edition.

                              <span>We already knew the Super Mario Bros. Movie was doing alright for itself, but - having surpassed Frozen 2 as the biggest animated movie debut - it&#x27;s now officially the highest grossing film of 2023 so far and the biggest video game adaptation  of all time.


That&#x27;s according to Variety, which reports The Super Mario Bros. Movie has now surpassed $500m at the global box office, with $260m of that coming from US ticket sales and $248m of its record-breaking take earned internationally.


Previous reports had placed The Super Mario Bros. Movie as having had the biggest opening of any video game adaptation ever, but latest figures push that even further, making it the highest grossing video game adaptation of all time, surpassing the surprisingly successful Warcraft movie ($439m), Detective Pikachu ($433m), and Rampage ($428m).

                              <span>Dark and Darker studio Ironmace Games has asked players to torrent the mediaeval extraction looter&#x27;s latest build following its delisting from Steam last month amid ongoing legal woes.


Dark and Darker had a bit of a moment when its third playlest gained more than 100,000 concurrent players during Steam&#x27;s Next Fest back in February, but that initial success soon took a turn when Ironmace was accused of making its game &quot;using materials and assets they worked on during their time&quot; at developer Nexon.


Although Ironmace has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, the studio was subjected to a police raid in response to those accusations and Dark and Darker&#x27;s Steam listing was ultimately removed following a cease and and desist demand from Nexon. At the time, Ironmace said it was working with its legal team to remedy the issue.

                              <span>Interesting article on the colossal squid, which is larger than the giant squid.
The article answers a vexing question:
So why do we always hear about the giant squid and not the colossal squid?
Well, part of it has to do with the fact that the giant squid was discovered and studied long before the colossal squid.
Scientists have been studying giant squid since the 1800s, while the colossal squid wasn’t even discovered until 1925.
And its first discovery was just the head and arms found in a sperm whale’s stomach.
It wasn’t until 1981 that the first whole animal was found by a trawler near the coast of Antarctica...</span>

You want to commit suicide, but it’s a mortal sin: your soul goes straight to hell, forever. So what you do is murder someone. That will get you executed, but if you confess your sins to a priest beforehand you avoid hell. Problem solved.
This was actually a problem in the 17th and 18th centuries in Northern Europe, particularly Denmark. And it remained a problem until capital punishment was abolished for murder.
It’s a clever hack. I didn’t learn about it in time to put it in my book, A Hacker’s Mind, but I have several other good hacks of religious rules...</span>

                              <span>The long-running Pokémon anime returned to Japanese TV screens today following a brief hiatus - as previous series stars Ash Ketchum and Pikachu have now departed after more than two decades.


The revamped show features a fresh cast of characters lead by dual protagonists Liko and Roy - but it wasn&#x27;t just these new human faces who made their debut. 


Today&#x27;s episode also features our first glimpse at an all-new Pokémon species not yet available in any game - a baby turtle, which remains unnamed (thanks, Serebii).

Company of Heroes 3 marks the first time the celebrated series has made the jump to consoles, and arrives on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the PC version&#x27;s features - including its two solo campaigns and various multiplayer modes - intact, aside from a couple of omissions.


As explained in Relic&#x27;s Company of Heroes 3 FAQ, the console edition omits the PC version&#x27;s in-game store, Challenges, and mod support. However, it does feature some console-specific tweaks, including full controller support, a custom UI designed specifically for gamepads, plus a number of features enabling console players to tackle the game &quot;at their own pace&quot;.

                              <span>The suspected leaker wanted by the FBI for releasing top secret military documentation via Discord has been arrested, after being identified using information gleaned from his Steam profile.


21-year-old Jack Teixeira from Massachusetts was scooped up by federal agents last night following a furious search over the course of this week. 


Files apparently leaked by Teixeira included highly sensitive details about the war in the Ukraine, and information on US allies apparently obtained through covert means.

                              <span>Peppa Pig: World Adventures gives players the chance to explore the globe, but perhaps its most memorable moment comes from its section set in London. There, players can meet England&#x27;s late Queen, in a playful sequence which sees the monarch ride a bus around the capital before joining Peppa and friends in a spot of puddle jumping (everyone loves jumping in muddy puddles, you know). 


This particular section of the game became widely-shared online soon after Word Adventures released thanks to a viral clip showing the game&#x27;s unexpected In Memoriam tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, which pops up at the end of the London chapter. 

Following the chapter&#x27;s conclusion, the screen fades to black and the words: &quot;HM Queen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022 In Memoriam&quot; appear on screen, alongside an image of the late Queen,  mid-puddle splash with Peppa.

Mercer shared the news via Twitter last night, and called the role an &quot;an immense honour&quot; he has &quot;thrown [himself] into doing justice&quot; to. 


Alongside this announcement, Mercer also shared images of him cosplaying as Link when he was a child, and one of him more recently as Ganondorf.

                              <span>An upcoming TV ad for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has leaked, giving us a glimpse at a few more, previously unknown, details. 


Beware elements that could be considered minor spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom below. If you want to head into the game as fresh as you can, this is your cue to head elsewhere.


The video, which popped up last night on reddit, is a TV spot for Nintendo&#x27;s sequel, likely planned for the game&#x27;s launch next month. Some of the footage we have seen before, such as Link using Ultrahand to build a Hylian hovercraft, but there are some small glimpses of new things I will detail below.

The addition has not been publicly confirmed by Bethesda, but was spotted by DSOGaming. 


Fellow Bethesda-published game Redfall is also set to use Denuvo at launch, according to its Steam page.

Released under the EA Originals label, Immortals of Aveum is a flashy-looking fantasy first-person shooter where you wield magic instead of guns.


Today brings a new trailer (below) with some pretty-looking cutscenes and some chaotic looking gameplay sections that are, frankly, a blur of neon particle effects, as the player fires out spells and conjurs up a magical shield.

For those who have followed previous reports and the recent PAX East presentation, this State of Play didn&#x27;t offer any new details beyond putting the world, characters and Eikon battles into context. 


But the presentation was aimed instead at PlayStation owners and newcomers to the series. After all, this is Sony&#x27;s big PlayStation exclusive for the near future, arriving on 22nd June worldwide. Check out the presentation below.

Never Alone (also known as Kisima Ingitchuna) tells the tale of an Iñupiat girl named Nuna and her Arctic fox as they search for the source of an eternal blizzard in order to save their village from starvation - a quest presented as a narrative platformer playable both solo and in co-op.


While an enjoyable adventure in its own right, Never Alone is perhaps equally notable for its educational elements, with the game - which was made in collaboration with the Iñupiat community and narrated by a storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language - incorporating videos of the Alaska Native community sharing stories of their culture and the Arctic world.

                              <span>Following reports last month that Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice would be delayed again, Warner Bros. has made it official - and then some - pushing the Batman Arkham Knight follow-up&#x27;s release all the way back to 2nd February 2024.


This does, of course, mark the second substantial delay for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice, which was initially expected to arrive in 2022 before Warner Bros. made the decision to shift its launch to 26th May this year in order to &quot;make the best game we can&quot;.


Rumours Warner Bros. was having another change of heart first emerged at the end of March, when Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier and Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden reported Suicide Squad was now targeting a later release, after an extended PlayStation State of Play reveal in February was met with a less-than-enthusiastic reception from fans - with with many lamenting its uninspired action and live-service trappings.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s wonderfully weird new expansion The Duviri Paradox finally has a release date, and is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on Wednesday, 26th April.


The Duviri Paradox, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is quite a departure for Warframe. Not only does its new open-world area, Duviri - perhaps most notable for the fact it exists inside the mind of the expansion&#x27;s new big bad, Dominus Thrax - trade sci-fi for something closer to a fantasy western, it also propels the long-running free-to-play shooter into the realm of roguelikes.


Cast as a Drifter sentenced to death at the start of the expansion&#x27;s story (which newcomers can select as an alternative introduction to Warframe), players are soon liberated by the mysterious rewind-on-death power that forms the core of the roguelike-inspired experience. Before long, they&#x27;ll gain a fancy skeletal steed and a random assortment of perk-like Decrees, both proving invaluable as they set about restoring colour to a world shaped by the moods of its master.

                              <span>You can beat the game without a computer:
On a perfect [roulette] wheel, the ball would always fall in a random way. But over time, wheels develop flaws, which turn into patterns. A wheel that’s even marginally tilted could develop what Barnett called a ‘drop zone.’ When the tilt forces the ball to climb a slope, the ball decelerates and falls from the outer rim at the same spot on almost every spin. A similar thing can happen on equipment worn from repeated use, or if a croupier’s hand lotion has left residue, or for a dizzying number of other reasons. A drop zone is the Achilles’ heel of roulette. That morsel of predictability is enough for software to overcome the random skidding and bouncing that happens after the drop.”...</span>

Before we dive on into it, here is that trailer again: 


First off we see the game&#x27;s sky islands, along with a Construct who is whacking away a Blue ChuChu. We then see a Construct chopping at a tree, in a rather calming way.

                              <span>Microsoft is now running adverts for its $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition on the London tube network. 


Digital advertising branded with Xbox and Microsoft logos have been spotted with the following message: &quot;Call of Duty. For 150 million more players.&quot;


As spotted by Tom Warren, the advert comes a month after Microsoft previously published full-page adverts in the UK&#x27;s Financial Times and Daily Mail with the same phrasing, and a claim Microsoft&#x27;s bid to &quot;unite Activision Blizzard and Xbox&quot; would deliver &quot;more games, for more players on more platforms&quot;.

                              <span>Today brings Nintendo&#x27;s last trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, containing three minutes of footage from the highly-anticipated sequel. 


After years of wait, we&#x27;re now less than a month away from Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s arrival - and there&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about the game itself. 


What are the dungeons like? What&#x27;s going on with Ganon? Is Zelda playable? Here&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s last trailer to answer precisely none of these questions for certain.

The presenter explained their team within Microsoft decided to tackle &quot;creating a truly optimised Windows experience for the handheld PC market.&quot;
Steam Deck runs on Valve&#x27;s own Steam OS, but is capable of running Windows (though not without some caveats).

The game was released for PS5 and PSVR2 back in February, but will hit PC on 27th April (spotted by Gematsu).



Fantavision was originally a launch title for the PS2, created by Sony&#x27;s now-defunct Japan Studio back in 2000.

A new 73-page missive by the self-proclaimed gamers includes fresh details they say have been taken from redacted documents given &quot;directly to the board of directors&quot; at Microsoft, as well as information given by Sony.


In a statement to Reuters, Microsoft said this latest complaint was based on &quot;unsupported and implausible claims about the deal&#x27;s effect on competition&quot;. Microsoft said it will &quot;bring more games to more people&quot; through its proposed deal with Activision.

                              <span>An update for the Steam Deck&#x27;s open source video driver will reduce the handheld PC&#x27;s shader cache files by more than half. 


That&#x27;s according to PC Gamer, which stated this update will shrink the files by &quot;approximately&quot; 60 percent.


Just quickly for those who, like me, aren&#x27;t as technologically minded as others: Steam Decks come in set sizes in terms of the internal SSD memory. However, these aren&#x27;t particularly big - though memory can be expanded through microSD cards. So, with Valve now planning on reducing the size of its shader caches, this update will free up more space for games on the console.

                              <span>Last night, Season 3 of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Warzone 2.0 went live. Reception to the added content in Warzone 2.0 DMZ has been negative, with players taking to social media to criticise Activision for including pay-to-win elements.
The patch notes for the Season 3 update state that &quot;certain&quot; bundles have been added to the game&#x27;s store which have additional Active Duty Operator Slots included.
Players start out with 3 slots by default, and there&#x27;s no other way to obtain more other than buying the new Bomb Squad bundle, which costs about £8.40. The cosmetic bundle contains other perks which players have pointed out will give those who pay for it an advantage over those who don&#x27;t.

                              <span>A Gamestop employee who sparked speculation regarding the Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom special edition Nintendo Switch Pro console has claimed they were fired following pressure by Nintendo itself.


While the special edition Switch Pro was only officially confirmed by Nintendo during its Direct broadcast last month, fans had long expected a Zelda-themed model to arrive alongside the upcoming game. Indeed, earlier leaks online had even suggested at its design. 


So when Massachusetts GameStop employee Mike (last name kept anonymous) saw a &quot;HW TBD Switch&quot; entry pop up on his store&#x27;s system hours before the Direct&#x27;s broadcast, it didn&#x27;t seem too surprising. Mike snapped a picture of the screen and uploaded it to reddit.

                              <span>The controversial boss of Nintendo&#x27;s Russian division has reportedly set up a secondary company to import and sell Nintendo games, skirting the Super Mario maker&#x27;s official Russian sales ban. 

Nintendo officially halted product shipments to Russia in March 2022, and said its decision would remain in place for the &quot;forseeable future&quot;. Nintendo also shut down its digital eShop in the region, citing &quot;the suspension of transactions in Rubles by the payment provider&quot;. 


Now, a report by Russian outlet Kommersant has highlighted the recent sale of Metroid Prime Remastered in Russia by a company named Achivka, which has been set up by Nintendo Russia boss Yasha Haddazhi to import Nintendo games and consoles to Russian game stores.

                              <span>Yesterday Sony announced the next games joining its PlayStation Plus subscription in May, including a number of Bethesda-published games.



The PlayStation Blog also noted Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, Resident Evil, and NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 &quot;will be among some of the titles leaving the PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue in May&quot; as part of its &quot;normal content refresh&quot;.


It doesn&#x27;t list any further games, but checking the Last Chance To Play section of the PSN Store reveals there are in fact over 30 games leaving the subscription on 15th May.

                              <span>Microsoft president Brad Smith has claimed Russian intelligence agencies and private military company The Wagner Group were trying to &quot;penetrate gaming communities&quot;. 


During a chat at Semafor&#x27;s World Economy Summit, the discussion turned to leaked Pentagon documents that appear to stem from a gaming chatroom and contain sensitive information about the Ukraine war. This allegedly includes details about the deployment of British special forces, among others. 
In response to these comments, Smith stated Microsoft&#x27;s threat analysis team had &quot;been identifying efforts by the Russians&quot; to weave their way into gaming communities, with the intention to spread information from there. Smith specifically mentioned Discord and Minecraft, as an example. He said Microsoft has been &quot;advising governments&quot; on this issue, before stating: &quot;It&#x27;s the Wagner Group, it&#x27;s Russian intelligence.&quot;

                              <span>Sony appears to have stopped sending out email receipts for downloads of PlayStation Plus games.


Email receipts are sent whenever games are downloaded from the PSN store, but this includes &#x27;free&#x27; games downloaded as part of the PS Plus subscription.


This is something Sony has been doing since the PlayStation 3 days and likely caused many players confusion when downloading multiple games at once and receiving individual email receipts for each - despite them being for £0.00.

PlayStation Stars was first announced in July last year. In September, Sony showed some of the collectibles that can be obtained by completing tasks, including 3D models of Ape Escape and a PlayStation 3.
The new collectible is a 3D model of Yoshida as a bobblehead, complete with a short explanation of his role at PlayStation in working with third-party and indie developers.

                              <span>When you think of Peppa Pig, you probably don&#x27;t think of a brand that pushes boundaries. After all, Peppa comes from your typical nuclear family, and her adventures within the show are generally confined to the day to day dealings of their lives together: Peppa and her family taking a trip to the recycling centre, for example, or visiting a theme park, or doing some DIY around the house. You get the idea.


That said, the team behind the newly-released Peppa Pig: World Adventures video game wanted players to fully immerse themselves into Peppa&#x27;s world, no matter what their family dynamic, blueprint or fabric looks like. As such, developer Petoons Studio and publisher Outright Games included a character creator so players can customise their animalistic avatar, from gender and species to fur colour and accessories. Then, once their own character is designed, players can do the same for the rest of their family. 


This means if players want to make their character a brown fox with a blue rabbit for a parent, they can. If they want their character to have siblings that are different animals to them, they can. If they want their parents to be the same gender, they can.

This year&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick - which will once again feature an in-person component - runs from Sunday, 28th May to Sunday, 4th June, and is set to feature more than 130 speedruns over its seven-day run-time, with all money raised going to Doctors Without Borders.


As ever, the newly shared schedule is an eclectic one, with the likes of Elden Ring and Hi-Fi Rush rubbing shoulders with everything from Disney&#x27;s 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue and Peggle Deluxe to Michael Jackson&#x27;s Moonwalker.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s latest monthly Xbox update is readying to roll out to consoles, this one introducing a refreshed Xbox search &quot;experience&quot; alongside a new adjustable active hours power setting, letting users decide when their machine can fully shut down.


Once the new update is installed, Xbox users can head to their console&#x27;s Settings &gt; General &gt; Power options in order to determine what Microsoft calls their &quot;active hours&quot; - essentially, the times they&#x27;re most likely to be using their machines.


During active hours (which are &quot;always active&quot; by default, until changed), Xbox can be instructed to power down using the Sleep option, enabling it to quickly reboot when required. Conversely, the console will power down using the more energy efficient Shutdown option outside of active hours, reducing power consumption from 10-15 watts when active to 0.5 watts, based on Microsoft&#x27;s figures.

                              <span>Amnesia: The Bunker, SOMA developer Frictional Games &quot;unscripted&quot; WW1 horror, has been delayed again, albeit only by a week. It&#x27;s now due to release for PC on 23rd May, giving the studio a little extra time to &quot;make sure everything is perfect before launch&quot;.


The Bunker, as you might already know, is the fourth game in Frictional&#x27;s Amnesia series, following on from 2010&#x27;s acclaimed The Dark Descent, its Chinese-Room-developed successor A Machine for Pigs, and 2021&#x27;s Rebirth. It&#x27;s also a bit of a departure for the series, trading traditionally linear tales of horror for &quot;unscripted&quot; scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world.


This time around, players take on the role of Henri Clément, a French soldier who, over the course of the game, is relentlessly pursued by an &quot;adaptive&quot; otherworldly creature through the claustrophobic confines of a dimly lit underground bunker.

I wrote about this kind of thing in 2000, in Secrets and Lies (page 318):
My favorite example is a band of California art thieves that would break into people’s houses by cutting a hole in their walls with a chainsaw.  The attacker completely bypassed the threat model of the defender.  The countermeasures that the homeowner put in place were door and window alarms; they didn’t make a difference to this attack.

The article says they took half a million dollars worth of iPhones. I don’t understand iPhone device security, but don’t they have a system of denying stolen phones access to the network?...</span>

                              <span>Amplitude Studios has announced a delay for its tactical action roguelite and Dungeon of the Endless spiritual successor, Endless Dungeon, pushing its release back from next Tuesday to 19th October in order to ensure &quot;the game reaches its full potential&quot;.


Endless Dungeon, which was originally due to launch on 18th May, maroons players on a mysterious space station and tasks them with recruiting a team of heroes in an effort to transport a crystal to their crashed ship&#x27;s core, protecting it - via some frenetic top-down twin-stick shooting action - from ceaseless waves of monsters along the way.


It features a new storyline set in the Endless universe, and can be played either solo - one player controlling the entire squad - or alongside friends in multiplayer, with available heroes including Comrade (Gunsmith), Bunker (Tank), Blaze (Artificer), and Shroom (Medic).

                              <span>Having spent the first half of this year whisking players off to Croft Manor and Midgar, PowerWash Simulator is set to embark on a whole new set of adventures, with developer FuturLab having now unveiled its content roadmap for the remainder of 2023.


FuturLab has divided its new roadmap up into convenient quarters, each offering a mix of both free and paid DLC. The free stuff will reveal more of Muckingham, the not-entirely sensible setting of PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s base game, while the paid Special Packs will take players outside of the Muckingham universe - presumably in a similar fashion to those aforementioned Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy 7 crossovers.


No more details have been shared on the paid stuff as yet, but FutureLab has confirmed PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s first free update - The Muckingham Files (AKA Update 1.2) – will arrive next Tuesday, 18th April, transporting players to never-before-seen corners of Muckingham.

It&#x27;s curious timing for the Microsoft-owned Bethesda to suddenly flood the service with its back catalogue in this way. 


Could it be another push by Microsoft to show regulators it doesn&#x27;t limit access to titles from companies it previously bought, as the decision on whether Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition will succeed nears?

                              <span>For those of you so hungry for more The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom news you simply must consume it the second it appears (understandable), Nintendo has announced it&#x27;ll be airing the final pre-launch trailer for its hugely anticipated Breath of the Wild follow-up tomorrow, Thursday 13th April.


If you need a little more in the way of specifics for your diary, Nintendo says the new trailer will be livestreamed at 3pm in the UK/7am PT, and will run to around three minutes in length. There&#x27;s no word on what it&#x27;ll feature as yet, but if Tingle&#x27;s not included, I&#x27;ll bloody riot.


Our last look at Tears of the Kingdom came toward the end of March, when Nintendo shared 10 minutes of new gameplay footage, showcasing some of Link&#x27;s new abilities, new enemies, and the sky islands. It was enough to set Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan a-quiver, and he subsequently named it Game of the Week.

A 60fps &quot;Performance mode&quot; option is still planned for Redfall on consoles, but will now arrive post-launch via an update, publisher Bethesda confirmed today.

For a quick bit of background before we get into it, Dark and Darker is facing a lot of issues at the moment, with developer Ironmace currently under investigation after gaming company Nexon claimed its game (P3) was used as a prototype for Dark and Darker. 


This all led to Dark and Darker being removed from Steam, where it was once the most wishlisted game.

                              <span>After a bit of a leak earlier this year, developer FrozenByte has made it official; acclaimed physics-based co-op platformer Trine is returning for a fifth instalment - subtitled A Clockwork Conspiracy - sometime this &quot;summer&quot; on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.


First things first, Trine 5 once again adopts the series&#x27; classic 2.5D side-scrolling perspective after Trine 3&#x27;s ambitious, but ultimately poorly received, foray into full 3D back in 2015. That&#x27;s likely a reassurance for series fans, but also makes for a new instalment that perhaps doesn&#x27;t particularly distinguish itself from its predecessors at first glance.


Not that more of the same is necessarily a bad thing; Trine has carved something of a niche for itself over the years, and its platform puzzling - built around using the unique abilities of the series&#x27; wizard, knight, and thief protagonists, from heavy lifting to block conjuring and hook grappling - remains as enjoyable today as it did when the series debuted almost 15 years ago.

The software developer has partnered with spectating and analysis platform Skybox to create the Virtex Stadium, which will launch with Counter-Strike (both CS:GO and Counter-Strike 2 will be compatible).

Earlier this year, Dambuster Studios revealed Dead Island 2 will make its debut on 21st April, so a week on Friday. 


Now, the studio has revealed the PC specs players will need to get the game up and running when the time finally comes for us all to dive into the zombie-riddled shores off LA (or, Hell-A, as the team has christened it).

Details from Japanese site Livedoor, via Siliconera, suggest the suspect was previously being bullied by their boss - a matter which Konami&#x27;s HR department had been dealing with.

The organisation&#x27;s Game Credits Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to promote &quot;inclusivity and best practices for how credits are attributed, affecting career and awards prospects&quot;.


As well as full guidelines, it&#x27;s published a Crediting Quick Guide including advice such as &quot;when in doubt, give credit&quot;, not removing a name if a staff member leaves the company before launch, and including all contract and full time studio employees.

This patch, which is live now, adds two T-shirts for players to dress Ellie up in. The first of these shirts is a blue number themed on HBO&#x27;s The Wire. You can see how it looks in the header image above. 


The second, meanwhile, is a tribute to The Last of Us&#x27; recent TV adaptation. Please note, if you have not watched the show yet, there is a minor spoiler ahead.

It&#x27;s the first time you&#x27;ve been able to buy PokéCoins outside of the Pokémon Go app itself. 


This method of acquiring PokéCoins also seemingly circumvents the 33 percent cut typically taken by app store owners Apple and Google - a thorny subject which previously got Fortnite in hot water.

                              <span>Sony has announced it&#x27;s airing a new PlayStation State of Play showcase this Thursday, 13th April, this one focusing on Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming Final Fantasy 16.


Square has, of course, been rapidly ramping up the pre-release promotion of Final Fantasy 16 as its PlayStation 5 launch on 22nd June draws nearer, and this latest State of Play showcase - which airs on Thursday, 13th April, at 10pm BST/11pm CEST/2pm PT - promises over 20 minutes of new gameplay footage.


More specifically, Sony says the stream - viewable via Twitch and YouTube - will shed more light on Final Fantasy 16&#x27;s &quot;dark fantasy setting, the powerful Eikons and the Dominants who house them, and the flashy battle system teased in those early trailers.&quot;

                              <span>Rare co-founder Tim Stamper has been digging into his archive again of late, promising to reveal &quot;more secrets&quot; from the studio&#x27;s vault, and his latest helping of retro treasure comes in the form of new footage from Rare&#x27;s cancelled N64 game, Dream.


Announced back in 1995, Dream was to be Rare&#x27;s take on the role-playing genre, with a dash of LucasArts thrown in, following the fairy-tale-inspired adventures of a boy named Edson as he battled the nefarious Captain Blackeye and his band of pirates. 


Originally planned for release on the SNES, Dream was later retooled for the N64, switching from isometric visuals to more ambitious full 3D. As time went on, however, technical issues and several rethinks caused some dramatic changes in direction, with Edson eventually being dropped in favour of new protagonist Banjo and the original RPG elements making way for a more straightforward Donkey Kong Country-esque platformer.

                              <span>If your animal splicing experiments are starting to feel a bit stale, there&#x27;s some good news; park management sim Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo is getting some aquarium-themed DLC later this year, opening up the potential for even more adorable/terrifying creature hybrids in your life.


Let&#x27;s Build a Zoo, if you&#x27;ve not yet had the pleasure, melds familiar zoo tycoon gameplay - in which the aim is to build and manage an appealing (and hopefully lucrative) park, importing and breeding animals, managing staff, and so on - with a couple of unique twists.


There&#x27;s a morality system - giving players the choice between maintaining a happy, ethical zoo or turning it into something considerably more dubious - as well as a compelling DNA splicing hook, enabling fearless tinkerers to combine any animals they&#x27;ve acquired into more exotic specimens, like crocoducks, giraffephants, and chickow.

                              <span>QuakeCon returns this August with its first in-person event in three years.


QuakeCon 2023 runs from Thursday, 10th August until Sunday, 14th August and will be held at Texas&#x27; Gaylord Texan Resort &amp; Convention Center. This marks the first time QuakeCon has featured an in-person event since 2019, with the show having switched to a digital-only schedule in 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic.


There are, however, some notable changes for this year&#x27;s in-person return; Bethesda has announced it&#x27;s ditching QuakeCon&#x27;s usual General Admission entry and exhibit hall set-up in favour of a ticket-only event - requiring pre-registration - that&#x27;ll emphasise the show&#x27;s bring-your-own-computer LAN party experience.

Avoid using free charging stations in airports, hotels, or shopping centers. Bad actors have figured out ways to use public USB ports to introduce malware and monitoring software onto devices that access these ports. Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead.

How much of a risk is this, really? I am unconvinced, although I do carry a USB condom for charging stations I find suspicious...</span>

                              <span>The blockbuster success of Nintendo&#x27;s new Super Mario Bros. Movie has likely guaranteed a galaxy of spin-offs and sequels will follow - and that&#x27;s on top of the end-credits tease already sitting at the film.


There are several moments where the Super Mario Bros. Movie seems to set up characters and plot elements for future film entries - while the lack of story in this initial movie has come under criticism. 


Join us as we take a look beyond this rather safe - albeit still enjoyable - new step by Nintendo into the world of cinema, and consider where the Super Mario Bros. Movie series will most likely head next... as well as where we hope it doesn&#x27;t.

                              <span>Ten months after its initial reveal, Konami&#x27;s Super Bomberman R sequel has a release date, and is launching digitally for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 13th September.


Like its 2017 predecessor, Super Bomberman R 2 serves up a sizeable mix of single-player and multiplayer modes inspired by Konami&#x27;s classic bomb-dropping arcade series.


This time around, lone players can test their mettle in the appropriately titled Solo-Bomb mode, which takes them on a story driven jaunt through space as they explore planets, using their bombs to destroy objects and annihilate enemies.

                              <span>Ashley breaks the fourth wall in Resident Evil 4 Remake when players try to look up her skirt.


The original game included lines of dialogue if Leon attempted to look under her clothes, including calling him a pervert.


In the remake, she remains silent but will bend down and stare directly into the camera and at the player to scold them.

But even though this may be the case, this is the first time the mod has allowed the full campaign to be completed without a VR headset. 


&quot;This is our biggest update yet and we have no plans on slowing down,&quot; the NoVR team shared earlier. &quot;With thousands playing Half-Life Alyx NoVR we are happy to announce our largest update yet! As the titles state the entire game can now be played from start to finish, with the Gravity Gloves fully implemented along with combine fabricators providing weapon upgrades.&quot;

Sonic Team provided a load of alternative moves in Frontiers to expand Sonic&#x27;s combat options - presumably the Spin Dash just didn&#x27;t fit.


Now a dataminer has found references to the Spin Dash in the latest update, which has seemingly been corroborated by the game&#x27;s director Morio Kishimoto.

Sharing the news on Twitter, Xbox head Phil Spencer said Microsoft and EE were &quot;expanding [their] partnership&quot; with this 10-year agreement to bring Xbox and Activision Blizzard PC games to EE customers should the buyout go through. 


&quot;We are committed to bring more games to more people, however they choose to play,&quot; Spencer wrote, although he stopped short of sharing any details on how this partnership would be presented to customers.

                              <span>Sensitive US military documents pertaining to the war in Ukraine were leaked in a Minecraft Discord server.


The leak contained information about the types of weapons used by Ukrainian and US forces, details on Ukraine&#x27;s air defence systems and offensive capabilities, battlefield fatality statistics, and communication about US military allies.


As The Wall Street Journal reports (via Kotaku), the documents were uploaded to a small Discord server of American users, but later spread to a Minecraft Discord server in March before appearing on 4chan, Twitter, and Telegram.

In addition to this, Harada has also seemingly confirmed there will be a beta for the game. 


Harada seemed to be having a rather nice time replying to fans on the social media platform over the weekend, confirming that &quot;of course&quot; crossplay would be included on Tekken 8&#x27;s release (which is slated to be some time next year, although a firm date is yet to be announced).

The &quot;difficult decision&quot; has been made as it shifts focus to &quot;an exciting new project&quot;, according to a new blog post.


Players will still be able to play, create and share Dreams with others, but no new updates will be released, or game events like DreamsCom, All Hallows&#x27; Dreams or the Impy awards. The game will remain available for purchase after 1st September.

Season 2 of Arcane is just &quot;not ready yet&quot;, Riot Games boss Nicolo Laurent has said, when asked when the League of Legends spin-off show would be back.


The first season of Arcane debuted back in November 2021 to critical acclaim and an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program. A second season was quickly confirmed by Netflix - though we&#x27;ve been waiting for more news ever since.

The ADL published its online Holocaust Denial Report Card earlier this week. Here, the ADL lists the 10 most popular gaming and social media platforms and rates them based on the degree to which they aid the spread of Holocaust denial content.


Epic Games and Fortnite received an F grade, the lowest score reported by the ADL. The ADL noted the game does not have an explicit Holocaust denial policy. Additionally, Epic took more than 24 hours to respond whenever an incident was reported to it, and also failed to take action on reports made by average users.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. Movie is a monster success, and has broken the record for the largest-ever opening weekend of any animated movie.


The Mario brothers brought in $377m in ticket sales worldwide  since their debut last week, beating previous record holder Frozen 2&#x27;s $358m.


As you might expect, this also gives Mario the best opening for any video game adaptation ever, animated or otherwise. Indeed, Mario has already almost caught Sonic the Hedgehog 2&#x27;s $405m total gross in just a few days.

                              <span>Lily Gao, the voice actor behind Resident Evil 4 Remake&#x27;s Ada Wong, has hit back at critics in a new Instagram post.


The actor deactivated her account at the start of the month following thousands of vitriolic messages complaining about her performance and claiming she &quot;ruined the remake&quot;.



&quot;My Ada is a survivor,&quot; said Gao in the new post, which also included images of Asian women in cinema who inspired her portrayal of the character.

It’s an interesting experiment, and the results are likely to vary wildly based on the details of the experiment.
But while it’s an easy experiment to run, it misses the real risk of large language models (LLMs) writing scam emails. Today’s human-run scams aren’t limited by the number of people who respond to the initial email contact. They’re limited by the labor-intensive process of persuading those people to send the scammer money. LLMs are about to change that. A decade ago, one type of spam email had become a punchline on every late-night show: “I am the son of the late king of Nigeria in need of your assistance….” Nearly everyone had gotten one or a thousand of those emails, to the point that it seemed everyone must have known they were scams...</span>

                              <span>Behaviour Interactive is reverting Dead By Daylight&#x27;s healing system change following player feedback.

Behaviour figured that the change – which saw the time to heal slowed from 16 to 24 seconds – would be contentious, and said that it would keep &quot;an extra close eye on this change to see how it would play out&quot;. 

&quot;After reviewing player feedback, we found that many of you agreed that the speed which you heal others was already in a good spot prior to the update,&quot; the team explained in an update. &quot;This change also had knock-on effects elsewhere in the game, making effects like Mangled and Hemorrhage stronger and making ‘slugging’ (leaving Survivors in the dying state) even more effective.

                              <span>Physical copies of Castle of Shikigami 2 on Switch will release later this year in the US and Europe.

Whilst Red Art Games stopped short of revealing when, exactly, the physical editions will be ready, in a press release the studio said that the &quot;reworked&quot; scrolling shooter – the 2021 PC version of which sits on a &quot;positive&quot; score on Steam – is set to come in 2023.

&quot;Castle of Shikigami 2 is a &quot;story-driven bullet-hell shooting game that first appeared in arcades in 2003 and was later ported to home video game consoles such as the SEGA Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube,&quot; the publisher teases.

                              <span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie is off to a rip-roaring start and looks set to hit a record-breaking £296m ($368m) over the Easter weekend, making it the second-best global debut ever for an animated movie at the domestic box office. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Mario movie is projected to take £110m ($137m) over the three-day weekend, making it the US&#x27; second-best animated movie start after Incredibles 2, taking the silver from Finding Dory.

THR reports that this is Illumination&#x27;s best-ever start – besting both Minions and Despicable Me – and is currently the top movie opening of the year, and the second-biggest five-day launch ever after Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which also debuted over the Easter bank holiday.

                              <span>Destiny 2 may have seen its latest expansion, Lightfall, bring its &quot;highest concurrent players in years&quot;, but developer Bungie has publicly acknowledged that it &quot;missed the mark on some of [its] goals&quot;.

In a candid update on the official website, the studio said that whilst the expansion &quot;surpassed [Bungie&#x27;s] sale expectations&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s clear the initial experience we delivered on day one didn&#x27;t provide the full clarity we originally planned for when we set out creating Lightfall&quot;.

&quot;We’ve taken a broad look at community feedback across the game since launch and have been working to address several areas in the coming weeks, while also forging ahead on content for our upcoming seasons,&quot; said game director, Joe Blackburn. &quot;Let’s get into the things we’re building and improving in response to your input on Lightfall so far.&quot;

                              <span>Capcom has added microtransactions to Resident Evil 4 Remake two weeks after the action horror was released.

The premium content - added alongside the much-anticipated, and free, Mercenaries DLC mode - has been introduced to give players &quot;access to a weapon&#x27;s exclusive upgrade at any time&quot;. 

Although there&#x27;s been no formal word from Capcom that the microtransactions were coming, 11 £2.49 &quot;Exclusive Upgrade Tickets&quot; popped up on digital storefronts just before the weekend.

                              <span>Women in Games CEO Marie-Claire Isaaman has released a statement asking if the games industry is &quot;going backwards&quot; following reports that &quot;multiple folks&quot; were assaulted or spiked at this year&#x27;s GDC event.

In a public statement, Isaaman reflected on employment stats and revealed that whilst &quot;both male and female gamers experienced similarly high levels of toxicity, showing that toxicity is an issue across the entire gaming community&quot;, &quot;the experience that girls and women encounter are often much darker and threatening&quot;.

&quot;Sexist stereotypes and being aggressively quizzed about their gaming skills often lead to more violent verbal abuse and threats of rape,&quot; Isaaman says. &quot;Even more disturbingly, the abuse doesn’t always stop once players leave the game – some instances manifest into serious consequences outside of gaming, including stalking on other platforms and threats of this transferring into real life.

                              <span>Numskull&#x27;s next Silent Hill statue is here, and it turns out the silhouette at the end of the Bubble Head nurse statue reveal did indeed tease the arrival of Silent Hill 3&#x27;s protagonist, Heather. 

You can&#x27;t throw a stone on the internet without hitting a Silent Hill figurine, but it&#x27;s a rare thing indeed to find one that isn&#x27;t a nurse or a Pyramid Head. Enter Numskull&#x27;s second Silent Hill collectible, Heather Morris*.  

Standing at ten inches tall, the statue references several elements from Silent Hill 3, including Heather’s outfit, her flashlight and gun, as well as Silent Hill’s Lakeside Amusement Park and its mascot, Robbie the Rabbit. Like the Bubble Head Nurse, the statue has been officially sanctioned by publisher Konami.

                              <span>American McGee&#x27;s attempt to develop a third instalment in his fan-favourite Alice series &quot;is at an end&quot;.

In a public statement posted to McGee&#x27;s Patreon, the developer said he had &quot;exhausted every option for getting a new Alice game made&quot; after IP holder Electronic Arts reportedly &quot;decided to pass on the project based on an internal analysis of the IP, market conditions, and details of the production proposal&quot;.

Shortly after the completion of the Design Bible, I resumed talks with Electronic Arts regarding our efforts to get a new game made,&quot; McGee explains. &quot;They were presented with the Design Bible and a Production Plan (produced in collaboration with Virtuos Games) outlining the schedule, budget, team, and design for the new game&#x27;s production.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in need of some entertainment to accompany your eggs this weekend, there&#x27;s a generous blob of undead slaughter to be found over on the Epic Games Store, where Dying Light&#x27;s Enhanced Edition is currently free for a limited time.


Dying Light&#x27;s blend of spirited parkour and zombie-slaying action soon started turning heads after its launch back in 2015, and it proved successful enough - it&#x27;s now sold well over 20 million copies - that it enjoyed seven years of post-launch content before developer Techland was finally ready to bring things to a close.


Dying Light Enhanced Edition, which is free on the Epic Games Store for the next seven days, features the hugely popualar base game and a selection of its post-launch DLC, including its Season Pass content and The Following expansion - which attempted to spice up the core game by slinging a rideable dune buggy into the mix.

The biggies, of course, are largely being fronted by Geoff Keighley, and following confirmation Summer Games Fest returns on 8th June, Keighley has dated his next big event: Gamescom Opening Night Live, which airs on 22nd August.


Keighley confirmed the return of Opening Night Live on Twitter, but stopped short of sharing much in the way of specifics. We do know, though, that it&#x27;ll once again be held at Cologne&#x27;s Koelnmesse, kickstarting a week of Gamescom, which this year runs from 23rd-27th August.


&quot;Excited to be back in Cologne with the fans and industry,&quot; Keighley wrote in his announcement tweet, &quot;streaming video game news directly to you.&quot;

In the meantime, you should expect to see EA Sports FC branding plastered across football in the coming days, EA warned. This will include advertising in matches across the Premier League and WSL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1. 


EA&#x27;s press release today is filled with quotes designed to reinforce the support it has for its branding change, including the bosses of many of those leagues. In it, EA also describes Sports FC as a &quot;platform to create, innovate and grow new football experiences, connecting hundreds of millions of fans through console, mobile, online and esports products&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has issued a fresh response to the ongoing drama surrounding Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard acquisition, and criticised the UK regulator currently probing the deal for recently softening its stance.  Sony&#x27;s statement also highlights the recent comments made by Redfall creative director Harvey Smith as fresh evidence of how Microsoft might mistreat Call of Duty on PlayStation if it were to own the first-person shooter series itself.


Last month, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority softened its stance on a key area of its concern over the deal passing, as it concluded that Microsoft owning Call of Duty would not &quot;result in a substantial lessening of competition&quot; in the console market. Sony&#x27;s response to this decision, published publicly today, is unsurprisingly critical of this latest development, which it slams &quot;surprising, unprecedented, and irrational&quot;. 


The response also leaps upon last month&#x27;s drama which erupted from comments made by creative director Harvey Smith, who revealed that Microsoft had canned plans for a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after buying Bethesda. These comments, Sony has now said, were an indication of how Microsoft could also treat Call of Duty, if and when the deal goes through.

The adaptation of the game was first announced in 2015, and has since faced several setbacks and delays. In October 2021, Blum revealed progress on the movie was being held back FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn, who reportedly refused multiple scripts. 

Filmmaker Chris Columbus, whose directing credits include Home Alone and Mrs Doubtfire, had previously been on board as director, but his departure was from the project was also confirmed in 2021.

                              <span>Sony has registered a patent which describes the possibility of including temperature-controlled haptic feedback in a PlayStation controller. 


The feature, which could emulate the sense of either hot or cold to the user, is part of several discussed in a patent for a controller made - at least in part - of a more gel-like material than the current plastic. 


Sony&#x27;s describes an &quot;elastically deformable material&quot; which is able to better aid in haptic feedback, and which can detect when said &quot;elastic member&quot; is touched, pressed, twisted, pinched, squashed, rubbed, or even &quot;in the action of bringing a hand close to the elastic member&quot;.

The streamer completed the All Bosses run at the end of March, sharing a clip on Twitter.


A Bop-It Extreme 2 was used, allowing for just five inputs, which certainly adds to the challenge beyond the unique device.

That&#x27;s more than a decade after we first heard word of the film, and six years on from Warner Bros&#x27; original plan of May 2019.


Details on what the film may look like or actually be about remain thin on the ground, save for the continued attachment of charismatic Game of Thrones and Aquaman star Jason Momoa in an undisclosed role. (He&#x27;s Steve, surely?!)

                              <span>New research: “Achilles Heels for AGI/ASI via Decision Theoretic Adversaries“:
As progress in AI continues to advance, it is important to know how advanced systems will make choices and in what ways they may fail. Machines can already outsmart humans in some domains, and understanding how to safely build ones which may have capabilities at or above the human level is of particular concern. One might suspect that artificially generally intelligent (AGI) and artificially superintelligent (ASI) will be systems that humans cannot reliably outsmart. As a challenge to this assumption, this paper presents the Achilles Heel hypothesis which states that even a potentially superintelligent system may nonetheless have stable decision-theoretic delusions which cause them to make irrational decisions in adversarial settings. In a survey of key dilemmas and paradoxes from the decision theory literature, a number of these potential Achilles Heels are discussed in context of this hypothesis. Several novel contributions are made toward understanding the ways in which these weaknesses might be implanted into a system...</span>

The problem
Since v1.19 (released in 2020), the Kubernetes project provides 12-14 months of patch releases for each minor version.
This enables users to qualify and adopt Kubernetes versions in an annual upgrade cycle and receive security fixes for a year.
The Go project releases new minor versions twice a year,
and provides security fixes for the last two minor versions, resulting in about a year of support for each Go version.
Even though each new Kubernetes minor version is built with a supported Go version when it is first released,
that Go version falls out of support before the Kubernetes minor version does,
and the lengthened Kubernetes patch support since v1.19 only widened that gap.
At the time this was written, just over half of all Go patch releas…</span>

                              <span>Veteran Mario voice actor Charles Martinet was previously confirmed to voicing a couple of characters in the Super Mario Bros. Movie - and now the film has been released, fans think they&#x27;ve worked out who those characters are.


Having watched the film myself, it&#x27;s fair to say Martinet&#x27;s voice is indeed recognisable - though the movie&#x27;s credits don&#x27;t offer any concrete confirmation. Instead, Martinet&#x27;s name is grouped alongside other secondary voice actors, without going into specifics on the exact characters he plays. 


If you&#x27;d prefer not to know more ahead of watching the film, take this as your spoiler warning - and feel free to head over and read our spoiler-free Super Mario Bros. Movie review.

                              <span>Phil Harrison has departed Google, where he served as vice president and general manager of Stadia, following the beleaguered cloud gaming service&#x27;s demise earlier this year.


Harrison joined Google in 2018 and shepherded Stadia through its high-profile - if increasingly problematic - launch in 2019, remaining onboard during the service&#x27;s slow, steady decline. It was Harrison who announced the closure of Stadia&#x27;s internal game development studios in 2021, and, ultimately, shared word of the cloud gaming service&#x27;s impending demise last September, admitting it hadn&#x27;t &quot;gained the traction with users that we expected&quot;.


Ahead of Stadia&#x27;s closure this January, Harrison said the underlying streaming tech would live on at Google, and would be made available &quot;industry partners&quot; - but Google later clarified its white label streaming offering had also been axed alongside the consumer-facing side.

                              <span>Just over 100 people have lost their jobs at Amazon&#x27;s video games division as part of the massive job culls announced a couple of weeks ago.

Over 400 Twitch employees lost their jobs in late March, with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy blaming the &quot;current macroeconomic environment&quot; for the layoffs. 


The further 100 employees who are being laid off are a part of Game Growth, Amazon Game&#x27;s San Diego studio, and Prime Gaming, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC. The memo was written by vice president of Amazon Games Christoph Hartmann.

Having seen the movie for ourselves, Eurogamer can now go into detail on what these scenes are - so, take this as your spoiler warning if you are going to see the film and don&#x27;t want to know what to expect. 


There are actually two scenes to stay put for throughout the movie&#x27;s credits - one after the first set of credits (which end with a pleasing nod to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata) and then the other at the very end.

The pop-up shop was last here in August for the 2022 Pokémon World Championships. Similar to last time, the store will be open for anyone to attend. 

Timeslot reservations are now open for anyone interested in visiting. It&#x27;s a good idea to book one if you&#x27;re planning to go, as the Pokémon Center always proves to be extremely popular when it&#x27;s around.

                              <span>After a bit of a VR-focused update back in February, Hello Games has once again turned its content nozzle on No Man&#x27;s Sky, blasting out pilotable Sentinel ships, corrupted worlds, and more in the exploratory space sim&#x27;s new Interceptor update.


Interceptor picks up where February&#x27;s Fractal update left off, making the new Interceptor ship class (previously an expedition-exclusive reward) available to everyone. However, given these vessels&#x27; unique Sentinel-tech, players will need some special resources to make them tick.


As it happens, Sentinels factor heavily in No Man&#x27;s Sky latest update, with players also able to acquire Sentinel Multi-Tools and Sentinel jetpacks. Additionally, it&#x27;s now possible for well-armed Travellers to take on powerful Sentinel Capital ships, with victory against the new threats clearing a player&#x27;s &quot;wanted&quot; status and earning new high-value rewards.

Creative 2.0, which launched last month, allows players to add custom assets and programming to their creations on PC. Shortly after it became available, Epic updated their terms and conditions to allow players to create and publish remakes of old Fortnite maps from Chapter 1.
Epic also reiterated that players are not allowed to use Creative 2.0 to &quot;create, publish, or monetise content based on others&#x27; copyrighted IP&quot;, though that did not stop players.

The DK Rap, created by Kirkhope for 1999&#x27;s Donkey Kong 64, is quite the legendary number, if you&#x27;ve never heard it before.


And last week, Seth Rogen, who voices leader of the bunch Donkey Kong in the Mario movie, revealed the DK Rap would feature in the film. Kirkhope initially responded with excitement, which has now turned into frustration.

                              <span>Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of the Super Mario series, has revealed the difficulty faced when creating Mario games for mobile.


Mario has had a few mobile outings over the last seven years - starting with Super Mario Run in 2016, and then Mario Kart Tour and Dr. Mario World in 2019.


Nintendo has since moved away from Mario on mobile, after it shut down Dr. Mario World for good just two years after it launched.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s acclaimed grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is ready to hit the road, with its Tours and Tournaments expansion now confirmed to be launching on 11th May.


Tours and Tournaments - Crusader Kings 3&#x27;s second major expansion, following last year&#x27;s Royal Court - has something of an outdoor theme. Those &quot;tours&quot;, for instance, arrive as part of a new travel system, giving players the tools to plot either a modest trip - perhaps navigating their realm, gifting or extorting their vassals along the way - or a far more elaborate globe-trotting jaunt, whether that be through dangerous or civilised lands, alone or with an entourage.


Tournaments, meanwhile, can be hosted around the map, their demonstrations of combat drawing nearby nobles and wandering knights, and potentially boosting players&#x27; social standing or military prowess. Additionally, players&#x27; best knights can be honoured with special titles and accolades granting bonuses to both them and the armies they lead.

                              <span>Call of the Sea VR, the virtual reality adaptation of developer Out of the Blue&#x27;s acclaimed 2020 tropical island mystery adventure, launches for Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro on 13th April.


Call of the Sea, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, tells the story of Norah Everhart (voiced by Firewatch and The Walking Dead: Season One&#x27;s Cissy Jones), as she embarks on an adventure, circa 1934, across a beautiful but strange South Pacific island in search of her missing husband.


What follows is a bit of a delight - Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchese called the original a &quot;dazzlingly different debut&quot; in his review - melding story, exploration, and some surprisingly challenging puzzles into a thrilling, affecting yarn with a touch of cosmic weirdness about it.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s perpetually expanding line-up of wireless Xbox controllers continues to flourish with a new &#x27;sustainable&#x27; variant released to coincide with this year&#x27;s impending Earth Day.


The new Xbox Wireless Controller – Remix Special Edition, as it&#x27;s known, takes some design inspiration from nature, sporting a two-tone green facade - apparently drawing on lichen found in the Pacific Northwest Forest - as well as earthy grips finished with a topographic pattern. It also incorporates a blue underside, presumably representing the sky, or the sea, or a blueberry.


As for the sustainability bit, one third of the controller is made from a mix of reclaimed materials (including plastic jugs and CDs) and regrind - regrind, in this instance, being a process that mechanically recycles leftover Xbox One controller parts into a raw material that can be used to partially create new controllers, Microsoft explains.

                              <span>Energy drink maker Monster has another video game trademark victim in its sights - this time, indie game Dark Deception: Monsters &amp; Mortals. 


According to the game&#x27;s developer Glowstick Entertainment, Monster has lodged a legal complaint that takes exception to Dark Deception: Monsters &amp; Mortals including the word &quot;Monsters&quot; in its title. 


Glowstick founder Vincent Livings has chosen to make the situation public via a thread on Twitter (as spotted by TheGamer), and pledged to fight Monster&#x27;s claim in court.

                              <span>With another patch expected today for The Last of Us Part 1 on PC, Naughty Dog has said it is focusing on improving the performance of the game before considering submitting it for Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck Compatibility Review.


Today&#x27;s patch will address camera movement and game crashes amongst other fixes. Another patch has been confirmed for Friday by Naughty Dog, which will share details of what the patch contains before it&#x27;s rolled out. 


The Last of Us Part 1&#x27;s PC port has not been well-received, with the game gaining largely negative reviews on Steam at launch.  Naughty Dog responded to the criticism by promising to address issues in patches.

Arriving today, we have Loop Hero, which is available across console and PC. Our Christian Donlan was rather taken with Loop Hero on its release, awarding it a Recommended badge. You can see a little trailer for it below.


Following this, we then have Iron Brigade arriving on 6th April across cloud and console. Then, on 12th April, Ghostwire: Tokyo will join the service via cloud, console and PC.

                              <span>News:
Researchers at Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky today revealed that they identified a small number of cryptocurrency-focused firms as at least some of the victims of the 3CX software supply-chain attack that’s unfolded over the past week. Kaspersky declined to name any of those victim companies, but it notes that they’re based in “western Asia.”
Security firms CrowdStrike and SentinelOne last week pinned the operation on North Korean hackers, who compromised 3CX installer software that’s used by 600,000 organizations worldwide, according to the vendor. Despite the potentially massive breadth of that attack, which SentinelOne dubbed “Smooth Operator,” Kaspersky has now found that the hackers combed through the victims infected with its corrupted software to ultimately target fewer than 10 machines­—at least as far as Kaspersky could observe so far—­and that they seemed to be focusing on cryptocurrency firms with “surgical precision.”...</span>
