                              <span>We&#x27;re going to get a look at some of Microsoft&#x27;s big new Xbox games tonight, in a brand new Xbox Developer Direct. We&#x27;ve been promised a look at the new Indiana Jones game, Obsidian&#x27;s new RPG Avowed, and Ninja Theory&#x27;s Hellblade 2.
We&#x27;ll be watching and covering it all live, from the moment it begins at 8pm UK time (GMT), to the moment it ends an hour later. And it&#x27;ll be much more fun with your comments and reactions, so please join us in the comments below.
So, what exactly can we expect? Well, Indiana Jones developer MachineGames - the team behind the brilliant Wolfenstein games - will apparently show more than 10 minutes of the game, detailing how it&#x27;s played, the story, the setting, and premiering a first trailer.

According to our sister site GamesIndustry.biz, these layoffs will affect employees from across the company, including Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks, Sniper Ghost Warrior studio Underdog and the &quot;majority&quot; of CI Games&#x27; marketing team.

                              <span>An unannounced Far Cry spin-off game known as Captain Laserhawk Niji Warrior has been rated by European classification board PEGI. While nothing official has been announced, this listing suggests a proper unveiling may be on the way soon


Spotted by Game Rant, PEGI&#x27;s listing states the yet-to-be-revealed title will see players pitted against each other in some kind of &quot;laser deathmatch&quot;, with the person clocking up the most kills declared the winner. 


Captain Laserhawk Niji Warrior has been rated 12 by PEGI, with mention of &quot;moderate violence to human-like characters&quot;. It will also include purchasable in-game items, such as cosmetics. The PEGI rating here is for PC.

The move follows Harmonix&#x27;s launch of Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like mode playable within Fortnite, at the end of last year - and the beginning of weekly track releases for that.


Rock Band 4 now features a library of nearly 3000 songs - and access to these isn&#x27;t going anywhere to anyone who has bought them. But no more will launch after the end of this month.

                              <span>Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker, the duo that co-founded  acclaimed Batman Arkham studio Rocksteady before departing to &quot;start a new adventure together in games&quot; in 2022, have set up a new AAA London development studio, Hundred Star Games.


Hundred Star Games&#x27; existence certainly isn&#x27;t a secret - it already has a website and a detailed Great Place to Work listing - but its connection to Hill and Walker has only just started to become more widely known thanks to a new report by Polygon, which spotted the duo were named as Hundred Star&#x27;s directors on corporate data website Endole.


Hundred Star hasn&#x27;t yet announced itself to press, and only a limited amount of information is currently available. On Great Place to Work, the East London studio says its ethos is to create a &quot;small team of only 100 industry veterans and emerging talents, who are committed to crafting cutting-edge gaming experiences that inspire and captivate players worldwide.&quot;

                              <span>Minecraft&#x27;s long-in-the-works movie adaptation continues to pick up steam, with the news White Lotus star Jennifer Coolidge has now joined its cast.


Word of Coolidge&#x27;s arrival on the project comes via Deadline, but the publication offers no word on the role she&#x27;ll be playing. That&#x27;s to be expected, given story details are being kept under wraps - although a report last year suggested it would focus on a &quot;malevolent Ender Dragon who sets out on a path of destruction&quot;.


Coolidge - who strode back into the spotlight with her widely acclaimed two-season portrayal of Tanya McQuoid in HBO&#x27;s stellar 2021 series White Lotus following an already impressive decades-long acting career - joins a cast including Game of Thrones&#x27; Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jack Black.

                              <span>Developer Supermassive&#x27;s acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn is being turned into a movie by the writer and director of 2017 horror hit Annabelle: Creation.


Until Dawn, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, released for PS4 back in 2015, delivering an interactive spin on the teen slasher genre - with a cast including Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere - where players could influence who lived and who died through the choices they made along its branching narrative. It was a cheesy, atmospheric, and hugely enjoyable romp, establishing the template Supermassive would later revisit in its recent Dark Pictures Anthology series.


Given that much of Until Dawn&#x27;s appeal came from the novelty of navigating through a whole bunch of knowingly trope-y slasher conventions (who hasn&#x27;t pondered if they&#x27;d have what it takes to survive a horror movie and become Final Girl), it&#x27;s perhaps an unexpected choice for a big screen adaptation - but the film&#x27;s being described as a &quot;R-rated love letter to the horror genre&quot;, suggesting it&#x27;ll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.

                              <span>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has vowed more legal action against Apple, just days after the US Supreme Court dismissed both parties&#x27; further attempts to appeal a 2021 California court ruling on the Epic vs. Apple antitrust lawsuit.


Epic initially launched court proceedings against Apple back in August 2020, after the company revoked Epic&#x27;s Fortnite developer account, preventing the game from being distributed on its devices. Apple made the move after Epic deliberately circumvented contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app, which would have allowed it to avoid Apple&#x27;s 30 percent platform fees.


A decision on Epic&#x27;s lawsuit came in September 2021, when Judge Gonzalez-Rogers ruled against Epic in nine of its 10 claims, determining the company had failed to prove Apple held a monopoly as defined by antitrust laws. Gonzalez-Rogers did, however, side with Epic in one matter, ruling Apple could not block developers from linking out to alternative payment methods from within their apps - a practice known as &quot;anti-steering&quot; - as that would constitute &quot;anti-competitive conduct&quot; under state law.

                              <span>Swedish video game holding company Thunderful Group is to implement a &quot;restructuring programme&quot;, which will see around a fifth of its workforce laid off.


Thunderful, which owns multiple development studios and publishers including Coatsink and  Somerville developer Jumpship, said this programme aims to &quot;strengthen the Group&#x27;s long-term competitive position&quot; by lowering costs and &quot;increasing focus on areas with the best future growth and profitability prospects&quot;. 


This will include staff reductions of approximately 20 percent, as well as the &quot;divestment of non-strategic assets&quot;.

                              <span>No, sorry, there won&#x27;t be a Bill and Frank TV spin-off for The Last of Us after all. Series co-creator Craig Mazin has said the crew is happy with what it accomplished with those characters in the first season, and as such &quot;there won&#x27;t be more Bill and Frank&quot;.
Mazin&#x27;s comments come after Bill actor Nick Offerman said a The Last of Us spin-off following the two survivors had been pitched to HBO. &quot;I think we pitched a whole mini-series of a prequel of their lives before they met each other,&quot; Offerman said, before joking: &quot;It could be a musical. We&#x27;re not short on ideas. We&#x27;ll just, we&#x27;ll see what Craig [Mazin] and Neil [Druckmann] come up with.&quot;
Speaking with Deadline, Mazin reiterated that Offerman was joking with his previous comments, which were made following the actor&#x27;s Emmy win. &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of the episode we did with Bill and Frank,&quot; Mazin said, later adding: &quot;We are very happy with what we achieved.&quot;

                              <span>Yes, Paradox Interactive has increased the price of its expansion subscription to Europa Universalis 4 in multiple regions, but not to the extent some players were worried about. 
Yesterday, several Canadian players shared emails they received from Steam which said the monthly price for their subscription had gone up to $122, a 21-fold increase on its initial price of $5.70. 
The price in Canada was quickly updated to $10.99, a much more sensible figure.

                              <span>Naughty Dog&#x27;s Matthew Gallant has said he doesn&#x27;t &quot;understand some of the consternation&quot; surrounding The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&#x27;s release.


The director was asked by VGC his thoughts on the backlash remakes and remasters - such as Naughty Dog&#x27;s upcoming native PS5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 - are often met with. After all, the original game came out less than four years ago. 


&quot;I don&#x27;t understand some of the consternation about what The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered offers,&quot; Gallant replied, adding he believes this release is &quot;the best way to play The Last of Us Part 2, if you&#x27;re a new PlayStation owner and new to the franchise&quot;.

                              <span>Yesterday, Shiba Inu Peanut Butter became the first dog to speedrun a game during Awesome Games Done Quick.
The fundraising event is currently underway, having begun on Sunday. As previously reported, streamer JSR_&#x27;s pet dog Peanut Butter was scheduled to be the first pet, and the first dog, to complete a speedrun for AGDQ.
Peanut Butter speedran Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES, in 26 minutes and 24 seconds, which is around a minute slower than his own world record, but well within the 30 minute slot he&#x27;d been allocated. Frankly, every Peanut Butter run is a PB record.

                              <span>Voice artist Cody Christian, who plays Cloud in the forthcoming Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, thinks &quot;shippers&quot; who &quot;overtly sexualise every relationship can ruin great story development&quot;.

Christian made the comments on X, formerly Twitter, following the latest trailer for Rebirth shared by Square Enix. Longtime fans of the original Final Fantasy 7 game (as well as Remake) have plenty of opinions on who Cloud&#x27;s love interest should be in the Tifa/Aerith love triangle, which has caused plenty of heated online debates.



&quot;&#x27;Shippers&#x27; crumble under the idea that a character is allowed to have significant relationships with MULTIPLE characters. This provides overarching depth,&quot; said Christian (thanks Games Radar). &quot;The need to overtly sexualize every relationship can ruin great story development.&quot;

TopSpin 2K25 was announced yesterday, in conjunction with the opening day of the main draw at the Australian Open. Check out the first trailer below.

                              <span>You won&#x27;t find any Larian Studios games on a subscription service, said its CEO Swen Vincke.


In a thread on X, formerly Twitter, Vincke shared his views on subscription models in response to yesterday&#x27;s news that Ubisoft is evolving its service. Ubisoft&#x27;s director of subscription Philippe Tremblay said players need to be &quot;comfortable&quot; not owning games when discussing the range of consumer behaviour.


&quot;Whatever the future of games looks like, content will always be king,&quot; said Vincke. &quot;But it&#x27;s going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not. Direct from developer to players is the way.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Embark Studios has today released its shiny 1.5.0 update for The Finals, adding a new limited-time Solo Bank It mode, as well as a variety of bug fixes and further anti-cheat measures.


First off, that new mode. Embark calls Solo Bank It both &quot;experimental&quot; and a &quot;fast-paced all-in-action&quot; experience, so you are sure to be kept on your toes. It pits 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. Those taking on Solo Bank It need to scoop up a total of 40,000 Cash to claim victory. 


The developer notes strategy is a key factor in this mode, as you won&#x27;t have a squad backing you up for you to rely on. You can see a little tease of what&#x27;s in store via the video below.

                              <span>Wakerunners is the next game from Mintrocket, the studio behind Dave the Diver.


The game is described as a team battle game with a top-down perspective set in a dystopian sci-fi future. So, quite the change from catching fish under the sea.


If you&#x27;re keen to check it out, a demo will be available during Steam Next Fest from 5th February.

                              <span>It looks like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s save bug woes on Xbox Series X/S might finally - fingers crossed - be at an end. The long-awaited fix that developer Larian Studios recently promised would arrive this week is now available to download.


Xbox players have suffered save game woes ever since Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 made its delayed debut on the console at the end of last year, with reports soon emerging that hard-earned progress was being wiped after crashing. Unfortunately, the issue has persisted as the weeks have gone by, and Larian recently confirmed a permanent fix would require a console update from Microsoft, which was still in the works at the time.


Finally though, after an agonising five-and-a-half-week wait, Microsoft&#x27;s long-promised fix is now here. Its arrival was confirmed by the official Xbox Support account on social media, which tweeted, &quot;An Xbox System Update will be rolling out from today to address the Save Game issue on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.&quot; All Xbox Series X/S players should automatically receive the update within the next week, it noted, but those wanting it sooner can manually force the update immediately via their console&#x27;s Settings menu.

                              <span>With Diablo 4&#x27;s third season of post-launch content - now officially titled Season of the Construct - rapidly approaching, Blizzard has finally deemed it time to share some details about what it&#x27;ll bring when it arrives on 23rd January next week.


&quot;Ancient forces threaten Sanctuary,&quot; the studio writes in a bout of scene-setting over on its blog. &quot;Aided by your Seneschal Companion, hazard the many traps and devastating Constructs beneath the deserts of Kehjistan.&quot; Here, it continues, &quot;elemental forces are amassing for malicious whims of the demon Malphas. Only by descending far below the surface will you be able to cull this cursed threat from its root.&quot;


Breaking that down into more specific terms, Season of the Construct introduces the seasonal robotic Seneschal Companion - available during the Seasonal Questline - a new dungeon type Blizzard is calling Vaults, weekly leaderboards in The Gauntlet, and a number of &quot;key&quot; new quality of life features, including WASD movement support on PC.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve not heard much about Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered since its unveiling back in September last year, but now developer Aspyr has emerged to share further details about what players can expect - including control toggles and a photo mode - when Lara Croft&#x27;s spruced-up early adventures come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC, on 14th February.


Writing in a new post on the PlayStation Blog, Aspyr explains it wanted to focus on &quot;additions instead of revisions&quot; when developing Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, saying it believes the &quot;gameplay of [the originals] is timeless.&quot;


To that end, it&#x27;s adding the option to toggle between the three games&#x27; &quot;classic&quot; tank-like controls and a more modern alternative, which takes inspiration from Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld; here, full camera control is mapped to the right stick, while Lara moves directionally based on the camera position.

                              <span>It looks like the wait for Final Fantasy 14 Online on Xbox Series X/S could be ending very soon; Microsoft today announced that an open beta for the acclaimed MMORPG was now &quot;officially available&quot; before yanking the post and tweeting to say it had &quot;incorrectly&quot; shared the news.


Final Fantasy 14 has been a long time coming to Xbox; it launched for PC and PlayStation back in 2013, but it wasn&#x27;t until last summer that Microsoft and developer Square Enix confirmed it&#x27;d finally be making the leap to Xbox - specifically Xbox Series X/S consoles - in &quot;spring 2024&quot;.


At the time, Microsoft said Final Fantasy 14 Online&#x27;s full Xbox arrival would be preceded by an open beta, planned to coincide with the game&#x27;s patch 6.5X. And with Patch 6.55 out today, 16th January, signs suggest Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Xbox open beta is imminent.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves&#x27; 11th season is right around the corner, and it looks like its arrival next Tuesday, 23rd January, could very well bring the most radical overhaul for the multiplayer pirate adventure since its launch back in 2018. Behold the advent of fast-travel.


As per Rare&#x27;s latest video update, Sea of Thieves&#x27; Season 11 makes sweeping changes to the way voyages are accessed and activated. Previously, voyages - essentially self-contained quests directing players to specific themed activities, if you&#x27;re familiar - could only be purchased from trading company representatives at one of the game&#x27;s starting outposts. That meant a whole lot of time spent engaged in often wholly uneventful sailing as you traversed back and forth across the map to pick up new voyages, drop off loot, and on.


From Season 11 onward, however, all voyages will be immediately accessible at any time from the updated Quest Table on your ship. Here, you&#x27;ll get on-demand access to trading company voyages (ranked by length), Tall Tales, and more, meaning you can dive straight into any voyage type you fancy without first needing to take a lengthy trip back to an outpost to buy it.

                              <span>Popular jail simulator Prison Architect will get a 3D successor, and it&#x27;ll release on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th March.


British developer Double Eleven and publisher Paradox Interactive made the announcement today, and confirmed a £35 pricetag ($40/€40). 


As you can see from the reveal trailer below, Prison Architect 2 (as it&#x27;s unsurprisingly titled) has been rebuilt from the ground up as a 3D experience, unlocking the ability to build across multiple floors in a sandboxy environment with ease.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?“:
Abstract: We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI’s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants’ language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</span>

Speaking with VGC, Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani said the team had &quot;dabbled&quot; with AI program Midjourney - a known AI tool that converts text into art - but the majority of the game has been crafted by hand.


&quot;All of the core elements in Foamstars - the core gameplay, and the things that make the game enjoyable - those are all made by hand,&quot; Okatani said.

                              <span>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has revealed a release date for the survival horror sequel of 5th September, 2024.
This marks a further delay to the game, which was intially meant to release in April 2022. Since then, the game has been delayed several times for polishing and due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Most recently, Stalker 2 was rumoured to be releasing in December 2023 before GSC Game World pencilled in a launch window of Q1 2024.
&quot;While there is absolutely no way to make another delay sound less dim,&quot; GSC Game World said in a press statement, &quot;we decided to be clear about our reasons to postpone the game for the sake of yet another wave of polishing.&quot; GSC stated the game contained &quot;certain technical imperfections&quot; at the beginning of the year, making it clear the game &quot;needed more time in the oven&quot;.

Titled High Tide, the update will add two new factions from the Sea Peoples culture, Sherden and Peleset, who are more than willing to drive the Bronze Age Collapse. Alongside the factions are 37 new units to use in battle.
Sea Peoples factions have access to new mechanics including War Spoils, in which you can raze settlements to raise resources, and will benefit from the Crisis and Collapse world states which put other factions at a disadvantage.

                              <span>Microsoft has revealed its next batch of Game Pass titles for January and into the start of February.


Notable additions with this wave include Persona 3 Reload and Palworld (aka Pokémon with guns, see picture above). Persona 3 Reload (Cloud, Console, and PC) will arrive early next month, on 2nd February. 


&quot;I can say that Persona 3 Reload&#x27;s promise is undeniable,&quot; wrote Henry Stockdale in Eurogamer&#x27;s preview of the game. &quot;Remaking an RPG with such a vast legacy would prove daunting for many, yet even with the omissions, Atlus is building on the original game&#x27;s foundations well. After many years of waiting, I&#x27;m excited to dive in properly next month.&quot;

                              <span>Take Two Interactive has entered a trademark dispute with Remedy Entertainment, and says the latter&#x27;s logo resembles the R* of Rockstar Games.


Remedy revealed this logo in a blog post back in April last year. &quot;The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old,&quot; it wrote at the time. &quot;It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today&#x27;s Remedy.&quot;


The new logo is a stylised R, but as reported by RespawnFirst, this has been opposed by Take-Two as &quot;there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public&quot;.

In a statement on the latest holdup, publisher Soma Games said the decision was a &quot;tactical move&quot; to aim for a different release window. 


The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology was previously set to arrive on 30th January for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. It&#x27;s a linear, story-based action adventure set in the world of Brian Jacques&#x27; brilliant children&#x27;s fantasy books, collecting three acts previously sold separately.

Ubisoft+ will now feature two revised tiers. Ubisoft+ Premium (£14.99/$17.99 per month) will include all new releases and - in some cases - early access to games alongside premium editions, monthly rewards and more. Ubisoft+ Classics on PC, meanwhile, is a brand new curated selection of popular back-catalogue and live games (£6.99/$7.99 per month).


Director of subscription Philippe Tremblay told GamesIndustry.biz there is &quot;tremendous opportunity for growth&quot; for subscription models, but the mindset of consumers needs to change.

As a reminder, &#x27;Ugly Sonic&#x27; was the original design for Sonic from the 2020 film, starring Jim Carrey and James Marsden. On Sonic&#x27;s initial full reveal in the first trailer, many were left unimpressed (to put it mildly) by the direction the designers had gone. But even before that there was concern, when posters teasing Sonic&#x27;s cinematic release showed the hedgehog&#x27;s oddly lithe silhouette and his nightmarish legs.


In fact, the criticism surrounding Sonic&#x27;s seemingly final look was so loud, the team went back to the drawing board and redesigned the titular blue hedgehog to a less controversial model. If you need a reminder, you can see the Sonic designs in the video below.

                              <span>Raven Software was at one time working on a standalone live-service version of Call of Duty&#x27;s popular Zombies mode, ex-Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt has revealed, but it was cancelled after its IP originator - presumably Treyarch - &quot;wanted it back&quot;.


That small revelation comes via Gummelt&#x27;s LinkedIn page (as spotted by MP1ST), which explains he was lead designer on an &quot;ambitious new Call of Duty: Zombies live service project&quot; between 2011 and 2012, but that the whole thing was canceled &quot;when the [Activision] studio that &#x27;owned&#x27; that part of the Call of Duty IP wanted it back.&quot;


Gummelt doesn&#x27;t explicitly state the name of the studio, but it seems reasonable to assume he&#x27;s referring to developer Treyarch, who created the mode for 2008&#x27;s Call of Duty: World at War.

                              <span>Last week, Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller caused controversy among players by revealing major gameply changes that&#x27;ll see tank and damage heroes receive a &quot;modified, tuned-down version of the Support self-healing passive&quot; in Season 9 - and Keller has now admitted it was a &quot;mistake&quot; to make the announcement &quot;out of context&quot;.


In his original announcement on the Overwatch blog, Keller explained the changes - part of a wider gameplay overhaul intended to reduce &#x27;frustration&#x27; when teams aren&#x27;t working together - should &quot;give non-Support players more options in terms of sustaining themselves&quot; and &quot;take some of the pressure off Support players to keep everyone alive since individual players now have more control of their own health pool.&quot; The idea, he explained, was to shift the balance &quot;between the power of a team and the power of an individual hero or player.&quot;


Since that announcement, there&#x27;ve been concerns among the Overwatch community that the changes might fundamental undermine the team-based spirit of Overwatch, while others have worried the shift may risk making Support characters redundant.

                              <span>Studio Wildcard has announced revised release dates for Ark: Survival Ascended&#x27;s The Center and Scorched Earth expansion map remasters following a delay for the latter last year, confirming they&#x27;ll arrival in February and April respectively.


A spruced-up version of Scorched Earth was originally due to launch alongside Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price remaster of Wildcard&#x27;s 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved - last year. However, in July, the studio announced that not only was it pushing the launch of the base game back to October, its expansions would be delayed too.


As per its revised plans, Scorched Earth was now targeting a December launch, with Ascended&#x27;s remastered Ragnarok and Aberration maps due in &quot;Q1 2024&quot;. Unfortunately, it became apparent Wildcard&#x27;s propensity for delays had struck again when a updated roadmap released in December showed Scorched Earth was now due in March 2024, with Aberration aiming for July 2024 and Raganarok not unexpected until September.

                              <span>Rebel Wolves - the studio formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - has confirmed its first project will be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker, after the title was reported online toward the end of last year.


When Rebel Wolves announced its existence in 2022, the studio said its mission was to &quot;evolve the cRPG genre by creating unforgettable stories and stirring deep emotions&quot;, confirming its first project would be a then-unnamed &quot;AAA dark fantasy built inside the Unreal 5 engine&quot;.


Since then, official word on Rebel Wolves&#x27; debut game has been limited, although CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as a secondary director on Cyberpunk 2077 while at CD Projekt - did tease it wouldn&#x27;t &quot;be as gigantic as The Witcher&quot; but could well have a &quot;greater&quot; number of quests. In the same interview, he also suggested the project would be around the same size as the Witcher 3&#x27;s Blood and Wine expansion.

                              <span>GAME, the UK&#x27;s biggest high street video game retailer, will no longer allow customers to trade in physical video games from next month, staff have told Eurogamer. 


The chain is expected to end its long-running video game trade-in facility on 16th February, with remaining pre-owned stock continuing to be sold until it has run out.


GAME staff have been told of the change, and Eurogamer has corroborated this with multiple branches of the retailer nationwide. We&#x27;ve contacted GAME itself for more.

                              <span>Elden Ring has received a new DLC listing as part of an update on Steam. While nothing official has been announced by developer FromSoftware as yet, there is a high chance this update relates to the game&#x27;s upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.


The update was shared by Ziostorm on X, after the user noticed Elden Ring&#x27;s DLC category had been amended on SteamDB. The update in question doesn&#x27;t have a name, and is merely listed as &quot;SteamDB Unknown App 2778580&quot; for now. However, many have speculated the developer will be making an announcement regarding the expansion&#x27;s release date in the near future. We will keep you posted. 


Other DLC listed in this section of Elden Ring&#x27;s Steam page includes the game&#x27;s digital artbook and soundtrack, as well as its Adventure Guide.

                              <span>Ahead of its release in just over a month, Square Enix has shared a new preview and trailer of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth now it&#x27;s available to pre-order.


The new blog post shares information on some of the locations and characters in the game, including an explanation of how Cait Sith will fight in battle.


Fans of the original game will be aware that Cait Sith usually fights atop his moogle companion, but in Rebirth he can fight solo too.

The actor reshared a post from web3 company WAME, which offered GTA fans the chance to have a &quot;realistic voice conversation&quot; with Michael. &quot;This is fucking bullshit,&quot; Luke wrote in response, tagging WAME.


&quot;Absolutely nothing cool about ripping people off with some lame computer estimation of my voice. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GARBAGE...&quot;

Eddy has been in every main Tekken game since Tekken 3, and though he&#x27;s missing from the base roster in Tekken 8, he&#x27;ll be playable as part of the first season pass.
There&#x27;s no word on when the season pass will begin, but Bandai Namco has it down for spring 2024. Take a look at Eddy&#x27;s reveal in the video below (which Bandai Namco snuck in at the end).

As reported by Aftermath, the developer employed over 400 people but many have taken to LinkedIn to share news of layoffs hitting the studio.


These layoffs are the latest in the restructuring programme of Embracer, the umbrella company which owns Borderlands developer Gearbox (which in turn owns Lost Boys Interactive).

                              <span>I recently began a new playthrough of Elden Ring and I&#x27;m determined to complete it this time round, but my goal pales in comparison to a streamer who is beating the game with a violin.
TiavioliGaming on Twitch has already completed all three Dark Souls games using a violin, and is now taking on Elden Ring as his next challenge.

TiavioliGaming caught the eye of the Elden Ring subreddit recently, thanks to a TikTok clip of him defeating Godfrey with his violin - all at a rather calm heart rate of 80bpm.

                              <span>Several upcoming additions to The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered have leaked. 


As is becoming the norm these days, this is your heads up to mute keywords and such on social media, if you want to keep as much of this spruced-up native PS5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 a surprise as possible. 

While the story of The Last of Us Part 2 is already widely known, given it initally released in 2020, several videos making their way around the internet currently include content not in the original, such as the Lost Levels (with potential spoilers), new skins and No Return gameplay.

                              <span>US Pokémon fans will now need to wait until 7th March to watch the rebooted Pokémon Horizons: The Series on Netflix. 


The delay was announced by the official Pokémon account on X, though no reason for the extra hold-up was mentioned. The series had previously been set to launch in the US next month. 


Pokémon Horizons is the new Pokémon anime series with fresh protagonists (including Captain Pikachu) and a new story, following the conclusion of Ash Ketchum&#x27;s long journey to become a Pokémon Master.

                              <span>The mysterious, long-rumoured Halo battle royale project from series co-developer Certain Affinity is no longer in development, a new report has claimed.


Speaking on the XboxEra podcast, reliable insider Shpeshal_Nick said the game, codenamed Project Tatanka, had seemingly been cancelled.


While officially unannounced by Microsoft itself, Certain Affinity had discussed the project publicly in broad terms several times, and said in late 2022 that it had been in the works for more than two years, with nearly 100 people then working on it.

The Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter, known for his penchant for auto-tune and singing about apple-bottom jeans and those boots with the fur along with Flo Rida, confirmed the news during a livestream.


However, this news arrived not because T-Pain was announcing his collaboration with Rockstar specifically, but because he was lamenting on an unexpected consequence of his new gig: the fact he can no longer roleplay on NoPixel, a GTA roleplay server.

Last week, James Lambert announced he had taken down the playable build of Portal 64 at Valve&#x27;s request due to its dependence on &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s proprietary libraries&quot;. 
In an update video uploaded over the weekend, Lambert said he expected Valve would ask him to take Portal 64 down &quot;because it&#x27;s their IP on a Nintendo console&quot;. &quot;Somebody from Valve reached out to me and I was put in contact with their legal team,&quot; he revealed.

                              <span>We&#x27;re just a week away from the launch of Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for PlayStation 5, and the studio has now announced it&#x27;ll be marking its arrival with Grounded 2 - an official making-of documentary that&#x27;ll be free to watch on YouTube.


Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, to give it its full name, is the sequel to Naughty Dog&#x27;s 85-minute making-of documentary for the original Last of Us, which launched back in 2015 and charted the &quot;dogged development and unique philosophy&quot; of the first game.


Filming of the newly announced follow-up - as per the spoiler-y trailer below - started in 2016 but was abandoned when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020. However, the existing footage has now been revisited and assembled into a making-of documentary that doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll entirely shy away from the more negative aspects of development at Naughty Dog, including crunch - a practice said to be particularly brutal at the studio in a report back in 2020.

                              <span>With Bethesda looking to ramp up the frequency of its Starfield updates in 2024 - it recently committed to a &quot;roughly every six weeks&quot; schedule starting in February - the studio is kicking off the new year by putting its latest patch into Steam beta next Wednesday, 17th January, with the promise of &quot;over 100 fixes and improvements&quot;.


Bethesda says it&#x27;ll share the full update notes when the Steam beta goes live on Wednesday but, ahead of launch, it&#x27;s teased a number of included improvements in a series of posts on social media. Next week&#x27;s update will, for instance, introduce improved textures, lighting, and shadows - the accompanying screenshots point to far more natural illumination on character&#x27;s faces, for instance - as well as additional widescreen support and stability improvements. 


Bethesda is also promising a &quot;multitude of fixes&quot; to quests, remedying the likes of docking and data transfer problems in Eye of the Storm, as well as preventing exploration blockers caused by missing temples in Into the Unknown.

                              <span>American Truck Simulator&#x27;s list of confirmed future stops is beginning to stack up; not only has developer SCS Software revealed trips to Nebraska and Arkansas are on the way, it&#x27;s announced it&#x27;ll be pulling into Missouri when those two expansions are done.


News that development on Missouri is now underway brings the total list of explorable states released or announced for American Truck Simulator since its launch in 2016 all the way up to 16. So far, players can trundle their way across California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma, with Nebraska, Arkansas and Missouri still to come (presumably in that order).


Announcing the Missouri expansion on Steam - which actually happened just before Christmas but I was off and likely in an extended brandy butter stupor at the time, so sorry for the delay - SCS wrote, &quot;Nestled in the heart of the American Midwest, Missouri beckons with a blend of historical significance, natural beauty, and vibrant urban landscapes. Known as the Show-Me State, Missouri invites visitors to explore its diverse offerings.&quot;

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s Naoki Yoshida thinks Final Fantasy 17 should be directed by someone new to make a game &quot;with challenges that suit today&#x27;s world&quot;.


Yoshida was interviewed by Sony&#x27;s Shuhei Yoshida on the Game Maker&#x27;s Notebook podcast (Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences) and candidly discussed development of Final Fantasy 14 and 16, as well as the future of the series.


When jokingly asked if he&#x27;s directing Final Fantasy 17, Yoshida replied that nothing has been decided yet. &quot;I&#x27;ve had the chance to work on two of these, 14 and 16, so maybe it&#x27;s time for someone new, instead of having the same old guys handle the next one,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, the well-received Three Kingdoms-era Soulslike from developer Team Ninja, is bundling its base game and all DLC into a single Complete Edition, launching for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC on 7th February.


Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which originally launched last March, serves up a challenging - but surprisingly approachable - action-RPG adventure build around a faster, more aggressive style of combat compared to Team Ninja&#x27;s previous Nioh games.


&quot;A new setting may suggest a new chapter,&quot; Eurogamer contributor Alan Wen wrote in his Recommended review, &quot;but I&#x27;d almost prefer to call Wo Long a Nioh-like, or rather the sequel that Nioh 2 should have been, further refining its systems and customisation, cutting back some if not all bloat, and adding an exciting evolution of its foundations that makes its masocore challenge more approachable on its own terms.&quot;

Both Portal 64, a demake to port the original Portal to the N64, and Team Fortress: Source 2, an effort to &quot;recreate a new [Team Fortress] experience&quot; in the Source 2 engine, were targeted by Valve.
On 10th January, the creators of each project released statements confirming the end of development and that each will no longer be available to download.

There are 11 characters to choose from in quest mode, and there&#x27;s a tutorial mode which introduces players to the basic controls.

Sand Land, for those unaware, is set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply for everyone. Yes, demons and humans. Obviously, something needs to be done about that, and so a rag-tag team sets off in search of the Legendary Spring to bring an end to this thirst.


Sand Land was first announced last year at Summer Games Fest, where we got a look at its arid setting and gorgeous art style. You can see it again now thanks to its new release date trailer, below.

The upcoming Felix the Cat release will include the feline&#x27;s NES title and Game Boy title. Both games will come with a range of new features and &quot;quality of life fixes&quot; for today&#x27;s gaming enjoyment. 


This release will be available physically for those with either a PlayStation console (it is coming to both 4 and 5) or a Nintendo Switch. Konami is handling the digital side of things, and is yet to announce a release date.

                              <span>Capcom has rolled back a recent update to 11-year-old game Resident Evil Revelations which added a DRM called Enigma Protector.
The DRM was noticed after Steam players began reporting errors when launching Revelations last week, including a reduced and unstable framerate, as well as broken mods.
Steam users review bombed Revelations with complaints about Enigma, which prompted Capcom to roll back the game on 9th January (which can be seen on its history via SteamDB).

                              <span>Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has admitted the Amazon-owned streaming platform isn&#x27;t profitable.


Clancy led a Q&amp;A stream on Twitch following the news earlier this week the company is laying off over 500 members of staff, equating to around 35 percent of its workforce.


&quot;We&#x27;ve implied this before where we say we need to run it sustainably,&quot; said Clancy, &quot;but I&#x27;ll be blunt: we aren&#x27;t profitable at this point.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft will fix a small amount of text-to-speech generated dialogue in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown as part of a future update. 


The upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game features the regular human-voiced cast you&#x27;d expect, bar one character: a tree spirit named Kalux. Kalux only has a small handful of lines throughout the game, but these have been left with work-in-progress generated dialogue.


Ubisoft has said it plans to add human-recorded dialogue at a later date.

                              <span>In a move that feels a little like being catapulted back in time several decades, Ubisoft has released a free playable Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown demo - for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC - ahead of the game&#x27;s full launch next week.


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown revives Ubisoft&#x27;s shamefully long-dormant action-platforming series for a new generation - a new generation that wouldn&#x27;t even have been born when the last game came out in 2008, thanks to Ubisoft&#x27;s dallying - this time sending the prince&#x27;s protector Sargon on a Metroidvania-style quest packed with side-scrolling combat and platform action.


Early word on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - which has been developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the wonderful Rayman Legends and Origins - is reassuringly positive, with Digital Foundry&#x27;s John Linneman calling it a &quot;supremely polished, ultra smooth game that perfectly leverages every platform it has shipped on.&quot;

                              <span>Well here&#x27;s one way of getting yourself some free publicity: casually announce your product will be releasing alongside Switch 2 this &quot;September&quot; so everyone excitedly thinks you might have just accidentally splurged Nintendo&#x27;s big secret, then, when you&#x27;re confronted about it, give a little shrug and admit you were just &quot;guessing&quot;.


That&#x27;s pretty much what happened today when audio company Altec Lansing shared a press release unveiling a partnership with GameShark (now AI Shark) that&#x27;ll see it release a new AI-powered GameShark successor - an announcement casually tossing in the sentence, &quot;The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024.&quot;


Unsurprisingly, Nintendo fans desperate for Switch 2 news following persistent reports the console is launching this year (hello, I am one of these people) immediately began to wonder if Altec Lansing - not a small company by any stretch of the imagination - might have just inadvertently shared some highly confidential information they shouldn&#x27;t have.

As reported by The Verge, employees at Discord were informed of the job cuts today by CEO Jason Citron in an all-hands meeting and accompanying internal email.


&quot;Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord&#x27;s workforce by 17%,&quot; Citron wrote in the email shared by The Verge. &quot;This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission over the long term.&quot;

However, creator Poncle isn&#x27;t done yet, and it&#x27;s now share a revised development roadmap (of sorts) for its perennially vampire-free minimalist survival RPG, which includes an update on cross-saves and a potential online co-op mode.


All this comes in a new goodbye 2023/hello 2024 post shared over on Steam, which begins with a recap of the year just gone and a thanks to players before moving onto matters in Vampires Survivors&#x27; near and not-so-near future.


That includes a word on the progress of online co-op support for the game, which Poncle confirmed it was &quot;investigating&quot; back in September last year. A little over three months on and the studio says it&#x27;s &quot;still investigating&quot; the feature, explaining that to &quot;retro-fit online multiplayer in a game as simple as this, but with so much content, is still a huge challenge.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;re big of years but small of shelf space, you might be interested in the newly announced 400 Mini, an officially licensed scaled-down version of Atari&#x27;s four-and-a-half decade old home computer, the Atari 400, which launches on 28th March this year.


Created by Retro Games Ltd - the company previously responsible for the C64 Mini and Amiga 500 Mini - the 400 Mini sports a similar design to Atari&#x27;s 1979 8-bit computer (albeit approximately half the size) but can do a little more beyond its inspiration.


As per Retro Games&#x27; announcement, the 400 Mini (styled THE400 Mini) doesn&#x27;t just emulate the Atari 400 hardware, it&#x27;s also emulates the entire 8-bit Atari range, including the 400&#x27;s pricier sibling the Atari 800, plus the XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

&quot;Dina is warm, brilliant, wild, funny, moral, dangerous and instantly lovable,&quot; said series co-creators and executive producers Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann in a statement following news of Merced&#x27;s casting.

                              <span>Paramount has released a new trailer for its Halo TV adaptation, as we approach the start date for season two.
The story picks up where the first season left off. Here&#x27;s the official blurb for season two: &quot;Master Chief John-117 leads his team of elite Spartans against the alien threat known as the Covenant. As humanity&#x27;s best hope for winning the war, John-117 discovers his deep connection to a mysterious alien structure that holds the key to humankind&#x27;s salvation, or its destruction - the Halo.&quot;
Take a look at the trailer embedded below.

                              <span>Remember last year, when The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla first suggested a new version of Part 2 was on the horizon? He said players would be able to make his in-game character &quot;play certain themes&quot; during the then-unannounced remastered&#x27;s release. 


Now, we have a closer look at just what Santaolalla was talking about, thanks to a new marketing beat for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.


Santaolalla&#x27;s cameo will actually be part of the game&#x27;s Guitar Free Play mode. Although, rather than playing the guitar as we have seen Joel doing in promo shots for the upcoming release, he will play the banjo.

                              <span>Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal will launch on Nintendo Switch in two weeks time, on 25th January. 


This release will be a souped up version of IOI&#x27;s 2006 title Hitman: Blood Money. It promises a host of improvements across 12 &quot;highly-replayable&quot; missions, including new features such as Instinct Mode, an ever-present minimap, and an array of gameplay improvements inspired by later games in IOI&#x27;s Hitman series. Of course, outfit changes and using as many different weapons and/or methods as you can is fully encouraged.


Here is a little trailer for it all, showing off some shenanigans across the globe. While I have no interest in becoming an assassin myself, I am rather jealous of Agent 47&#x27;s travel opportunities.

                              <span>Developer Core Engage and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have shared a gameplay overview of upcoming city builder New Cycle ahead of its release into early access next week.
New Cycle is described as dieselpunk by Core Engage, as the player is tasked with rebuilding society following a &quot;global catastrophe&quot; caused by solar flares. Settlements begin as very basic and players must progress into industrialisation, then capitalism, all whilst tackling the challenges thrown at them by the environment.
The gameplay overview takes us through each of these stages briefly, showing the transformation from a small hunter-gatherer settlement, to a larger industrial town with electricity and factories, before expanding and building a railway to enable trade and tourism.

Pokémon Go Tour: Sinnoh will debut Origin Forme Dialga and Palkia from 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Legends Arceus - ancient versions of the Legendary creatures from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (the appearance of which is not a surprise, as they were first revealed a little earlier than planned last year). 


Befitting their powerful status and space-time warping properties, the pair will debut a new feature for Pokémon Go named Adventure Effects. These are gameplay-changing abilities unlocked by interacting with the creature itself that can also be boosted further using in-game resources.

                              <span>Nintendo has shed light on the new features available in its Mario vs. Donkey remake for Switch.
The game was announced in September as an &#x27;updated&#x27; version of the original Game Boy Advance title. At the time, Nintendo didn&#x27;t say much else about the re-release, but did say multiplayer will be added.
The new trailer reveals multiplayer will come in the form of local co-op, and it looks like a second player will get to control Toad. Take a look at what&#x27;s in store for Mario in the trailer below.

                              <span>Diablo 4&#x27;s next season is now confirmed to go live later this month, despite Blizzard so far providing us all with very little detail on what it will actually contain.


Season of Blood - the game&#x27;s current season - is set to come to a close soon, with the next season then starting up on 23rd January. So, in just under two weeks.


While Blizzard itself has not &#x27;announced&#x27; this date at the time of writing, a message has been spotted in Diablo 4 itself proclaiming it to be so. As you can see in the image below, when players boot up the game, they are met with a notice on the character selection screen that reads: &quot;Season 3. Next season begins January 23, 2024&quot;.

                              <span>An unsettling AI-powered hologram of Nintendo mascot Mario at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 event in Las Vegas was unlicensed and unofficial, the company behind the technology has now admitted. 


The odd-looking and robotic-sounding Mario was the work of Proto Hologram, a company that creates holograms held within large box-like structures that you can talk to and interact with. 


More bizarre still, the Mario hologram was supposed to be a collaboration with the AARP, an American advocacy group for people over the age of 50 - apparently to demonstrate how AI holograms could combat loneliness in the elderly. But with Mario? And more to the point - with a poorly-voiced, dead-eyed broken 3D model of Mario?

There are some great Indiana Jones titles out there. There is also Dial of Destiny, but this is not the time or place to discuss that particular release. 


Now, the internet thinks it has worked out the title of MachineGames&#x27; upcoming Indiana Jones game. And it is... Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.


This assumption comes from social media user @Kurakasis, who shared their discovery on X last night. The user revealed that Lucasfilm has been registering a number of domain names that are variations on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle over recent days.

                              <span>A new model of the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller with improved battery life has been spotted on a retailer website.
The V2 version of the controller is currently listed on Best Buy Canada at $89.99 and while its features are almost identical to that of the regular DualSense, there are a couple of notable differences. 
The V2 DualSense will have an &quot;exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge&quot; according to the Best Buy listing, and also includes the DualSense charging station (which usually must be bought separately).

That&#x27;s according to Nikkei Asia (thanks VGC), which reports shares of Nintendo temporarily hit a record 7,902 today on Japan&#x27;s Nikkei stock index - up 5% from yesterday - pushing its market capitalisation over 10 trillion yen ($69bn) for the first time since November 2007.


The publication notes the reason behind the recent surge in Nintendo&#x27;s share price is two-fold. Firstly, growth expectations for the company are high in general, thanks to the success of its intellectual property related business, which recently announced a live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, alongside the expected launch of Switch 2.

Well, Medieval Castle (wrongly) won the vote, and some eight months later it looks like the DLC is ready for an imminent release.


That&#x27;s according to a presumably premature reveal on the EA App (thanks SimsCommunity), which provides full details and screenshots of the The Sims 4 Castle Estate Kit, as the new DLC is officially known. It also offers up a release date of 15th October, 2099 - which is almost definitely a placeholder, unless EA really is in it for the long haul where The Sims 4 is concerned.


Weird date aside, everything else in the listing looks accurate. Alongside two screenshots featuring the new DLC pack&#x27;s various building bits in action, we get some blurb explaining the Castle Estate Kit will enable The Sims 4 players to &quot;capture the classic grandeur of a castle&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to a presumably premature reveal on the EA App (thanks SimsCommunity), which provides full details and screenshots of the The Sims 4 Castle Estate Kit, as the new DLC is officially known. It also offers up a release date of 15th October, 2099 - which is almost definitely a placeholder, unless EA really is in it for the long haul where The Sims 4 is concerned.


Weird date aside, everything else in the listing looks accurate. Alongside two screenshots featuring the new DLC pack&#x27;s various building bits in action, we get some blurb explaining the Castle Estate Kit will enable The Sims 4 players to &quot;capture the classic grandeur of a castle&quot;.

Still, Mojang and Blackbird Interactive have continued to support Minecraft Legends with a series of post-launch content updates since its arrival, but Mojang has now confirmed today&#x27;s Snow vs. Snouts update - initially announced during last year&#x27;s Minecraft Live event and originally planned to launch in December - will be its last.

                              <span>Another month means a fresh heap of additions to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue for subscribers of its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers, with January 2024&#x27;s headliners including the Resident Evil 2 remake and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands.


From 16th January, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands will be available for both PS4 and PS5 (the PS4 version is also streamable), giving PlayStation Plus subscribers the chance to sample Gearbox&#x27;s well-received tabletop RPG spin on its raucous shooter series. As for Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil 2 remake, also available for both PS4 and PS5, it gives the 1998 classic a thorough modernising with splashy new presentation and ample mechanical tweaks, and the results are sublime.


Elsewhere, there&#x27;s an opportunity to revisit the PS4 version of the utterly wonderful LEGO City Undercover, developer TT Fusion&#x27;s wildy imaginative and genuinely hilarious open-world take on the familiar Lego game formula, which plays out very much like a family friendly GTA.

                              <span>Another month means a fresh heap of additions to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue for subscribers of its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers, with January 2024&#x27;s headliners including the Resident Evil 2 remake and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands.


Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands is available for both PS4 and PS5 (the PS4 version is also streamable), giving PlayStation Plus subscribers the chance to sample Gearbox&#x27;s well-received tabletop RPG spin on its raucous shooter series. As for Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil 2 remake, also available for both PS4 and PS5, it gives the 1998 classic a thorough modernising with splashy new presentation and ample mechanical tweaks, and the results are sublime.


Elsewhere, there&#x27;s an opportunity to revisit the PS4 version of the utterly wonderful LEGO City Undercover, developer TT Fusion&#x27;s wildy imaginative and genuinely hilarious open-world take on the familiar Lego game formula, which plays out very much like a family friendly GTA.

                              <span>Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada has asked Native American fans of the series for their thoughts on the designs of fighters Michelle and Julia, and what advice they&#x27;d give to him if he created a new Native American character for the series.
Michelle, a woman of Chinese and Native American descent, appeared in the first Tekken game. Michelle was included in the next games until Tekken 3, which introduced her adoptive daughter Julia. Since then, Julia has appeared in the main series instead, with both making appearances in various Tekken spin-offs. 
Since their first appearances, Michelle and Julia have frequently been brought up in discussions of Indigenous representation in video games. Harada took to X (née Twitter) last week to acknowledge the characters&#x27; importance within the topic, explain the history of their designs, and ask for the opinions of Native American Tekken fans.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 to get us up to speed on what has happened in the series so far. It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom respectively. But what Insomniac and Nintendo didn&#x27;t have (or who they didn&#x27;t have) was Succession&#x27;s Brian Cox to talk us through the story so far. 


Yes, the man that brought Logan Roy to life is here to tell us all about the Devil gene and more. &quot;Every single fight, no matter how big or small, has a story behind it,&quot; the Scottish actor states as dramatic music starts to pound in the background. &quot;There&#x27;s one hell of a story to tell.&quot;


We then get told more about that aforementioned Devil gene, some cliff chucking exploits and the Tekken series&#x27; patricidal puzzle. You can have a watch for yourself below. I don&#x27;t think it is meant to be funny, but it has made me chuckle.

A press release from the union states the agreement has been approved by affected members. It establishes minimum terms and conditions, ensures performer consent and negotiation for AI usage, and requires performers have the opportunity to opt out of AI use in new works.

The faceplates, shown in the header image above and below (thanks, The Verge), are from the Deep Earth Collection and consist of Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue and Sterling Silver. This collection, you may recall, was also announced for the original PS5 model back in September last year. 

&quot;While crafting this new collection of DualSense controller and PS5 console cover colours, we drew inspiration from the beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth. We elevated the colours by adding a metallic finish for a touch of sophistication,&quot; designer Satoshi Aoyagi said at the time.

                              <span>UPDATE 10/01/24: Twitch has now confirmed it&#x27;s reducing its workforce.
The news was shared in a new blog post from CEO Dan Clancy, including a copy of the internal email sent to staff. &quot;We greatly value the employees we&#x27;re saying goodbye to today as people and professionals and are grateful for all their efforts to support all of you,&quot; he wrote in the post. &quot;Please know that Twitch remains focused on serving our streamers and ensuring that this is the best place to livestream for many years to come.&quot;
The included email confirms just over 500 people will lose their jobs. &quot;This will be a very hard day. Our service exists to empower communities to create, together, and every single one of you has played a vital role in fostering our community and furthering that mission,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Just a day after Unity announced it would be laying off 1,800 employees as part of an ongoing &quot;company reset&quot;, it&#x27;s being reported that live-streaming site Twitch is now poised to cut 35 percent of its workforce - equalling around 500 jobs - later this week.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Cecilia D&#x27;Anastasio, who, citing &quot;people familiar with the plans&quot;, reports the cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday.


While Twitch declined to comment on the story when approached by Bloomberg, the publication claims the job cuts come amid continuing struggles for the live-streaming site. According to Bloomberg&#x27;s sources, Twitch still remains unprofitable nine years after Amazon acquired the company for $970m.

                              <span>Palworld, the open-world survival and crafting adventure from developer Pocketpair that looks a lot like Pokémon with guns, is launching into early access on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass next Friday, 19th January.


Pocketpair describes Palworld as a &quot;monster-catching, survival and crafting game&quot; over on its Steam page, but notes it also features &quot;a variety of mechanics from other genres in order to provide a completely new experience for everyone.&quot; And while harmonious living alongside the Pals you catch (initially totalling over 100) is certainly possible - with the likes of idyllic farming, land and sea exploration, dungeon crawling, battling, building, and breeding all featured - it also looks to have a darker side too, and not just because of those guns.


Players that choose to take on the game&#x27;s ruthless poaching syndicate might, for example, find themselves traversing perilous climes where limited resources could mean they&#x27;re forced to eat their Pals. Meanwhile, Pals can be put to work making fire, generating electricity, or mining ore, or sent to a factory line where they can be made to automate different tasks - until they drop dead, that is. Then, there&#x27;s poaching, with players able to do crime, sneaking into wildlife sanctuaries to capture rare Pals that can be sold for cash.

                              <span>Palworld, the open-world survival and crafting adventure from developer Pocketpair that looks a lot like Pokémon with guns, is launching into early access on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass next Friday, 19th January.


Pocketpair describes Palworld as a &quot;monster-catching, survival and crafting game&quot; over on its Steam page, but notes it also features &quot;a variety of mechanics from other genres in order to provide a completely new experience for everyone.&quot; And while harmonious living alongside the Pals you catch (initially totalling over 100) is certainly possible - with the likes of idyllic farming, land and sea exploration, dungeon crawling, battling, building, and breeding all featured - it also looks to have a darker side too, and not just because of those guns.


Players that choose to take on the game&#x27;s ruthless poaching syndicate might, for example, find themselves traversing perilous climes where limited resources could mean they&#x27;re forced to eat their Pals. Meanwhile, Pals can be put to work making fire, generating electricity, or mining ore, or sent to a factory line where they can be made to automate different tasks - until they drop dead, that is. Then, there&#x27;s poaching, with players able to do crime, sneaking into wildlife sanctuaries to capture rare Pals that can be sold for cash.

                              <span>Arrowhead Game Studios has shared more information on the PC version of its satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 ahead of its PlayStation 5 and PC launch on 8th February, alongside confirmation of crossplay support between platforms.


Helldivers 2 follows the same basic template as its well-received predecessor (which earned a Eurogamer Recommended badge back in 2015), sending players - either working solo or in teams of up to four - on procedurally generated missions across hostile alien worlds to complete objectives, subjugate the locals, and orchestrate their escape. The likes of customisable loadouts and stratagems return in the sequel, but the major difference is a shift from a top-down perspective to third-person one this time around.


And now, Arrowhead has confirmed players across PlayStation 5 and PC will be able to experience all the above together, courtesy of Helldivers 2&#x27;s crossplay support. &quot;Community and teamwork are the most important pillars of Helldivers 2,&quot; it explained, &quot;and so it is essential to ensure players can work together regardless of the system they choose to use. Together we can celebrate victories, mourn losses, and liberate the galaxy without platform boundaries.&quot;

Xbox fans rejoiced when Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 surprised-launched at the end of last year following an extended delay related to split-screen co-op, but things got off to a bumpy start, with some players soon reporting their saves were being lost after crashing - a frankly horrifying prospect for a title as lengthy and involved as Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.


Unfortunately, the issue has continued to persist in the weeks since; Larian recently offered a workaround to help players avoid the save issue, but noted that a permanent fix would require a firmware update from Microsoft, which was still in the works.

                              <span>HBO has cast the role of Abby for its second season of The Last of Us. 


As previously suspected, Kaitlyn Dever has secured the part. Dever was originally considered for the role of Ellie before the adaptation became a TV show, and the actress had aged out of consideration. 


The Booksmart and Dopesick actress will join Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie when filming begins next month. The show&#x27;s Abby is described as &quot;a skilled soldier whose black-and-white view of the world is challenged as she seeks vengeance for those she loved.&quot;

The Cult of the Lamb team also boasts about the arrival of &quot;shiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings,&quot; so plenty to keep an eye out for.

                              <span>Microsoft will show off a first look at its Indiana Jones game during a new Xbox Developer Direct broadcast later this month.


The showcase will be broadcast on 18th January at 8pm UK time - that&#x27;s 3pm Eastern or midday Pacific - and also feature Avowed, Hellblade 2 and Ara: History Untold.


Wolfenstein developer MachineGames will showcase more than &quot;more than 10 minutes of game and developer insights&quot; including the first gameplay trailer. Expect to hear details about when the game will be set, what its story will be about, and &quot;how fans will actually play as Indy&quot;. (Using a video game controller? An actual whip?! The mind boggles.)

                              <span>Microsoft will show off a first look at its Indiana Jones game during a new Xbox Developer Direct broadcast later this month.


The showcase will be broadcast on 18th January at 8pm UK time - that&#x27;s 3pm Eastern or midday Pacific - and also feature Avowed, Hellblade 2 and Ara: History Untold.


Wolfenstein developer MachineGames will showcase more than &quot;more than 10 minutes of game and developer insights&quot; including the first gameplay trailer. Expect to hear details about when the game will be set, what its story will be about, and &quot;how fans will actually play as Indy&quot;. (Using a video game controller? An actual whip?! The mind boggles.)

The Mega 95 is equipped with a five-inch display, which users can toggle to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 modes. As for its battery life - an ever important question for any handheld device - according to Hyperkin, it should last for 10 hours per charge.

Indeed, the game includes a plaque in the Justice League base &quot;in loving memory&quot; of Conroy, along with a similar plaque for Arleen Sorkin who was the inspiration behind Harley Quinn.

                              <span>UPDATE 10/01/24: The Apex Legends crossover event with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is live, meaning the cost of event packs is now confirmed.
As per the official Instagram video shared previously, the cost of event packs is 100 coins - reduced from the standard 1000 coins. 
However, the cost of packs actually increases depending on the number of items owned, as per the screenshot below. If players own 16 to 35 items, the cost of packs increases back to 1000 coins. It means if players want to own all 36 items (including the death box), it won&#x27;t cost the full £360 but they&#x27;ll still need to shell out a considerable amount.

                              <span>Fans of Apex Legends are outraged at the cost of cosmetic items in the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth crossover event, that they fear will total over £300.


The event begins later today in celebration of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving next month, and includes a number of themed items, skins, and events. 


This is the first in-game crossover of its kind in Apex Legends and the potential cost of items is eye-watering for fans. On social media, the high cost has sparked fury in the game&#x27;s community, although this is based on the current cost of packs that could be reduced once the event launches.

                              <span>Akka Arrh is making the jump from the flat screen to virtual reality, via its upcoming arrival on PS VR2. 


Akka V-Arrh, as I am now dubbing it (it is still officially just called Akka Arrh), will be heading to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation set in March. A more specific date is yet to be announced. However, when it does arrive, Jeff Minter&#x27;s psychedelic head-banger promises to &quot;transcend&quot; its former contrastrains, and give us all an &quot;unparalleled sensory odyssey&quot; on its VR release.

                              <span>Akka Arrh is making the jump from the flat screen to virtual reality, via its upcoming arrival on PS VR2. 


Akka V-Arrh, as I am now dubbing it (it is still officially just called Akka Arrh), will be heading to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation set in March. A more specific date is yet to be announced. However, when it does arrive, Jeff Minter&#x27;s psychedelic head-banger promises to &quot;transcend&quot; its former contrastrains, and give us all an &quot;unparalleled sensory odyssey&quot; on its VR release.


&quot;Here, players don&#x27;t just witness the chaos; they step inside it,&quot; the PR proclaims. &quot;In this surreal VR world of cascading shapes, colours, and sounds, every element of Minter&#x27;s vision comes to life with an intensity and clarity that was once unimaginable.&quot;

For years, Pokéfans have been able to follow the saga of Ash Ketchum - and beyond - without needing to subscribe to a streaming service. But now Pokémon TV is no longer able to be downloaded, and the service itself will go dark for good on 28th March. 


The situation highlights the fact that if you do want to go watch the Pokémon series in order, you&#x27;ll need access to multiple streaming services and a couple of paid subscriptions.

Jones said the behaviour was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and amounted to stalking.

During a segment hosted by Honda&#x27;s president Toshihiro Mibe talking about the car manufacturer&#x27;s work with Sony, the exec spoke about &quot;the joy of expanding life&#x27;s potential&quot;. 
Its vision expands beyond just your regular cars and motorcycles, with talk of the sky, ocean and outer space being shared. Sony&#x27;s technologies will help Honda expand its &quot;field of mobility&quot;, the company president explained.

                              <span>Sony has provided a very brief first look at its Gravity Rush film project, courtesy of a quick clip shown during the company&#x27;s CES 2024 press conference.


Around five seconds of footage, including a behind-the-scenes motion capture shot, can be glimpsed in the video below - it shows a blonde-haired character leaping from a rooftop, then soaring down through the buildings of a floating city.


At the end of the clip, the character then flies towards what looks like a red, dragon-like beastie. All of this takes place in rather realistic-like surroundings - a far cry from the anime-inspired visuals of the original games. Intriguing!

The news comes from Nick Offerman, who recently won an Emmy for his portrayal of Bill in HBO&#x27;s series.


Speaking backstage after the awards, the actor was asked about whether viewers could see more from Bill and Frank in the future. &quot;Oh, great question but I would have to ask somebody with a higher pay grade than myself,&quot; he replied (thanks, Deadline).

                              <span>Unity has announced a further round of layoffs, less than two months after its previous job cuts, that&#x27;ll see it eliminate roughly 25 percent of its total workforce - around 1,800 employees - as part of the &quot;company reset&quot; it unveiled at the end of last year.


Unity confirmed additional layoffs at the company were &quot;likely&quot; back in November, when it revealed it was assessing its portfolio &quot;to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers&quot;. Shortly after, it announced it was ending its agreement with Weta FX, resulting in the loss of 265 jobs - the company&#x27;s fourth round of layoffs since the start of 2022.


A fresh round of layoffs at Unity - the largest ever at the company - has now been confirmed in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, around 1,800 employees will be affected, with the company saying the cuts come as it &quot;restructures and refocuses on its core business&quot; and seeks to &quot;position itself for long-term and profitable growth.&quot;

Word Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 players were receiving bans for using an Xbox-approved feature with an Xbox-approved game (albeit in a way potentially violating Microsoft policy) surfaced last week, and developer Larian quickly moved to assure fans it was working with Microsoft to sort out the &quot;annoying and uncool&quot; suspensions. Shortly after it said affected parties should start seeing their bans lifted, and that &quot;Work is ongoing, and the Microsoft team is aware of the issue!&quot;.


A week on and Microsoft itself has now acknowledged the situation in a statement on social media. &quot;To provide clarity on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 mature content enforcement actions,&quot; it wrote, &quot;Xbox account suspensions are not automatic. Each clip is reviewed by a moderator and, if found in violation of our safety and content policies, actioned accordingly.&quot;

A week on and Microsoft itself has now acknowledged the situation in a statement on social media. &quot;To provide clarity on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 mature content enforcement actions,&quot; it wrote, &quot;Xbox account suspensions are not automatic. Each clip is reviewed by a moderator and, if found in violation of our safety and content policies, actioned accordingly.&quot;

                              <span>Following speculation Microsoft may be considering bringing its acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush to Switch, new reports have claimed the company has also been looking into a PlayStation and Switch release for developer Rare&#x27;s acclaimed multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves.


Journalist and prolific leaker Jeff Grubb initially claimed Microsoft had been eyeing up a potential PlayStation and Switch release for Sea of Thieves on his Game Mess podcast earlier today. That was followed by a similar story from former Axios journalist Stephen Totilo, writing on his newly launched Game File website.


Totilo offered a slightly different spin on Grubb&#x27;s report, saying he&#x27;d heard Microsoft had considered releasing Sea of Thieves on PlayStation, but that his &quot;source familiar with plans for the port&quot; had made no mention of Switch.

                              <span>This is an old piece of malware—the Chameleon Android banking Trojan—that now disables biometric authentication in order to steal the PIN:
The second notable new feature is the ability to interrupt biometric operations on the device, like fingerprint and face unlock, by using the Accessibility service to force a fallback to PIN or password authentication.
The malware captures any PINs and passwords the victim enters to unlock their device and can later use them to unlock the device at will to perform malicious activities hidden from view.

                              <span>Last month, I convened the Second Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy (IWORD 2023) at the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center. As with IWORD 2022, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first century.
My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies, it would look very different. Representation would look different. Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation would look different. Everything would look different, because we would have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to worry about...</span>

                              <span>UPDATE 9/1/24: Magic: The Gathering maker Wizards of the Coast has issued a statement saying it will work with external vendors to ensure AI-generated artwork is kept out of promotional material for the game. 
The statement follows the recent departure of an artist at the company, who said he had quit in protest at the promotional material.
&quot;Thanks to our diligent community who pointed out a series of recent marketing images may have included elements of generative AI, we are rethinking our process of how we work with vendors for our marketing creative,&quot; Wizards of the Coast wrote in a new statement.

                              <span>Artist Dave Rapoza has quit working for Wizards of the Coast following claims recent promotional material used for Magic: The Gathering was generated using AI tools.
Although Wizards of the Coast refuted accusations that a recent image was generated via AI, fans and artists alike were quick to point out inconsistencies with the image.
The charge is particularly emotive given Wizards of the Coast confirmed last month that it &quot;require[s] artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final Magic products&quot;.

                              <span>A remake of the original Metal Gear Solid game is reportedly still in development at Konami.
According to the Spanish website Areajugones – which previously, and correctly, leaked God of War Regnarök&#x27;s DLC existence ahead of a formal announcement – &quot;Konami is still working on a remake of the first installment, although right now Metal Gear Solid Delta is a priority in the studio&quot;.
The website reports that the claim comes from &quot;multiple sources&quot; and suggests that it will only be playable on PS5, not PS4. Similarly, there&#x27;s been no mention of a PC or Xbox release, either. Given Metal Gear Solid Delta is coming to multiple platforms, though, it stands to reason that the Metal Gear Solid Remake will, too. But all we can do is wait for official confirmation.

                              <span>A new tweet from the official Spyro the Dragon Twitter/X account has sparked hopes that a new instalment could be on the way.
The account merely tweeted a screenshot of the fan-favourite dragon and the words &quot;You gotta believe&quot;, but it&#x27;s the text that accompanied it – &quot;2024 motto&quot; – that has sparked excitement that a new game could be coming later this year.

                              <span>A new tweet from the official Spyro the Dragon Twitter/X account has sparked hopes that a new instalment could be on the way.
The account merely tweeted a screenshot of the fan-favourite dragon and the words &quot;You gotta believe&quot;, but it&#x27;s the text that accompanied it – &quot;2024 motto&quot; – that has sparked excitement that a new game could be coming later this year.

                              <span>A former Activision Blizzard executive has filed a discrimination claim with the company, alleging it of discriminating against &quot;old white guys&quot;.
As reported by Law360 and spotted by our sister site, GamesIndustry.biz, the complaint includes allegations against former CEO Bobby Kotick for remarks he made at an unspecified leadership conference in which he reportedly said that the &quot;problem&quot; at ABK was that &quot;there are too many old white guys&quot;.
The filing – lodged by a 57-year-old white man who worked at the company from 2014 until he was laid off as part of the company&#x27;s restructure in late 2023 – says that shortly after hearing these comments, a pair of white executives left &quot;based, at least in part, on Kotick&#x27;s ageist remarks&quot;, adding that &quot;Activision placed profits over people by terminating the older, higher-paid executives&quot;.

                              <span>Wizards of the Coast has hit back at claims one of its latest promotional images were made using AI generative tools.
After presenting an image of a new range of cards with the caption, &quot;it&#x27;s positively shocking how good these lands look in retro frame&quot;, Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s social media channel filled up with accusations that the image was generated via AI.
The charge is particularly emotive given Wizards of the Coast confirmed last month that it &quot;require[s] artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final Magic products&quot;.

                              <span>Wizards of the Coast has hit back at claims one of its latest promotional images were made using AI generative tools.
After presenting an image of a new range of cards with the caption, &quot;it&#x27;s positively shocking how good these lands look in retro frame&quot;, Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s social media channel filled up with accusations that the image was generated via AI.

It appears Netflix would only serve advertisements to ad-supported subscribers, but is also considering offering &quot;sophisticated&quot; games for additional cost on top of the subscription fee.

To fully appreciate this tribute, we need to go back a few years. When Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 was still in early access, forum user Solfalia messaged Larian to thank the studio for releasing Act I, despite the game not being complete. This release allowed Solfalia to play the game - as it was at the time - with their father, who had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Their father had played other Larian games in the past and was a fan, so this opportunity meant a lot to them both.


&quot;This Early Access means that this Xmas I&#x27;ll be able to go on an adventure with him one last time, and I know he&#x27;ll enjoy it,&quot; Solfalia wrote in their original post from 2020.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has been developed to be &quot;accessible by design&quot;, with a host of features that aim to make it an approachable release for all.


In a new video from the developer focused specifically on accessibility, the team shared how they have approached this release, with senior gameplay programmer Christophe De Labrouhe stating &quot;Metroidvania games can be quite hard, and this one can be quite hard too&quot;. 


But while The Lost Crown can be challenging, the team doesn&#x27;t want this to put players off, and so has included a variety of accessibility options as standard. This includes larger text by default, no quick time events and &quot;no colour-based feedback&quot;. In addition, there will be options that will allow players to customise the gameplay difficulty to a style that&#x27;s best for them.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has been developed to be &quot;accessible by design&quot;, with a host of features that aim to make it an approachable release for all.


In a new video from the developer focused specifically on accessibility, the team shared how they have approached this release, with senior gameplay programmer Christophe De Labrouhe stating &quot;Metroidvania games can be quite hard, and this one can be quite hard too&quot;. 


But while The Lost Crown can be challenging, the team doesn&#x27;t want this to put players off, and so has included a variety of accessibility options as standard. This includes larger text by default, no quick time events and &quot;no colour-based feedback&quot;. In addition, there will be options that will allow players to customise the gameplay difficulty to a style that&#x27;s best for them.

                              <span>UPDATE 8/1/2024: Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 Xbox players whose capture clips have been flagged by Microsoft should start to see their bans lifted. 
Developer Larian shared an update on X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend, to state work is ongoing to sort these bans. The bans in question saw players being penalised for capturing in-game footage containing nudity, which was then uploaded to Xbox servers.
&quot;Microsoft team is aware of the issue,&quot; the developer said. &quot;If you&#x27;re wanting to upload any clips in the meantime, make sure to turn off mature content.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Larian is working alongside Microsoft to sort out &quot;annoying and uncool&quot; account bans, which can happen when Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 footage containing nudity gets uploaded to Xbox servers. 


This all stems back to the weekend, when Reddit user Daddy-Vegas warned other Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 players about capturing certain footage in Larian&#x27;s award-winning RPG. The Redditor recorded &quot;some naked camp time fun&quot;, which they planned to share with their brother. Xbox then automatically uploaded the footage to its servers. 


However, if Xbox discovers imagery it deems offensive, the content is removed and the player&#x27;s profile will be &quot;temporarily prohibited from sharing additional imagery (typically for 24 hours)&quot;. And, as Daddy-Vegas&#x27; clips included that aforementioned nudity, they were met with a ban for each clip, which resulted in their account being suspended for a year. They have since appealed their ban, with the Redditor revealing earlier this week their efforts were successful.

                              <span>It looks like both Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 Remake could be released this year. 


In a new PlayStation blog and video (below) detailing the various games coming to the platform throughout 2024, Sony has listed both the upcoming remakes. Until now, neither game had an official release window.


Konami&#x27;s Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 Remake both sit nestled among the likes of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

                              <span>It looks like both Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 Remake could be released this year. 


In a new PlayStation blog and video (below) detailing the various games coming to the platform throughout 2024, Sony has listed both the upcoming remakes. Until now, neither game had an official release window.


Konami&#x27;s Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Bloober Team&#x27;s Silent Hill 2 Remake both sit nestled among the likes of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

                              <span>We don’t have a useful quantum computer yet, but we do have quantum algorithms. Shor’s algorithm has the potential to factor large numbers faster than otherwise possible, which—if the run times are actually feasible—could break both the RSA and Diffie-Hellman public-key algorithms.
Now, computer scientist Oded Regev has a significant speed-up to Shor’s algorithm, at the cost of more storage.
Details are in this article. Here’s the result:
The improvement was profound. The number of elementary logical steps in the quantum part of Regev’s algorithm is proportional to ...</span>

                              <span>Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser has denied being involved in a new flash cart project claimed to allow Switch users to play back-ups of their owned games.
The MIG-Switch flash cart, officially, is a &quot;third party back-up and development device for the Nintendo Switch&quot; according to the device website, that&#x27;s not endorsed nor licenced by Nintendo of Japan. While the idea behind the device is players can back up games they own legally, it also opens the door for piracy and for people to potentially play roms of games they do not own.
However, Bowser - who was sentenced to 40 months in prison for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices back in 2022 - said he was &quot;not involved&quot; in any aspect of the MIG-Switch. Rather, the hacker reportedly said he had been the &quot;subject of DNS poisoning attack on [his] nameservers&quot; (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>A collection of Monty Mole games from the 1980s will be making their Nintendo Switch debut on Monday, 8th January (well, here in the UK, at least - they are already available in the US). 


The Monty Mole Collection comprises five games, covering the original Monty Mole saga. This includes the main trilogy of games: Wanted! Monty Mole, Monty on the Run, and Auf Wiedersehen Monty. 


In addition, there are two bonus games to enjoy: Moley Christmas (which was originally given away with a magazine. As the name suggests, it will provide players with a &quot;seasonal adventure&quot;) and Sam Stoat: Safebreaker. This is the &quot;solo adventure of Sam Stoat, a supporting character from the main Monty Mole games&quot;.

Every month, the team at Humble selects a collection of PC games for its members to keep forever. In addition, members get 20 percent off the vast collection of games in the Humble Store, plus there&#x27;s a charity donation. It&#x27;s a nice little deal all round, really.


This month, the bundle building team has grouped together another eight games for its subscribers to enjoy. These are: Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, Two Point Campus, Aragami 2, OTXO, The Red Lantern, Roguebook, Hell Pie and Twin Mirror.

In a world first, 13-year-old Willis &quot;Blue Scuti&quot; Gibson - who is a competitive Tetris player - has managed to get the decades old falling block game to reveal its &quot;kill screen&quot;.

The delight shown by the young player, who was born over two decades after the game actually released, as the screen freezes is palpable. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; Gibson repeats. &quot;I&#x27;m going to pass out, I can&#x27;t feel my fingers.&quot;

                              <span>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is shutting down in April, after nearly 10 years of A-list fabulousness. 


The mobile sensation, which was released back in June 2014 by Kardashian and Glu Mobile, will no longer offer users any in-app purchases. It will be removed from the various app stores as well.


Those who already have Kim Kardashian: Hollywood installed can continue to play the game and use up their K-Stars (its in-game virtual currency) up until 8th April. After then, the &quot;game will become inaccessible for all players&quot;.

                              <span>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is shutting down in April, after nearly 10 years of A-list fabulousness. 


The mobile sensation, which was released back in June 2014 by Kardashian and Glu Mobile, will no longer offer users any in-app purchases. It will be removed from the various app stores as well.


Those who already have Kim Kardashian: Hollywood installed can continue to play the game and use up their K-Stars (its in-game virtual currency) up until 8th April. After then, the &quot;game will become inaccessible for all players&quot;.

Speaking with Polish outlet Parkiet (and shared by IGN), chief strategy officer of parent company CD Projekt S.A. Adam Kiciński said the company is fine as it is, and hopes it will continue to grow independently.


&quot;We are not interested in integrating ourselves into any larger entity,&quot; Kiciński told the publication. &quot;Throughout our entire lives we have worked towards the position we currently hold. We believe that in a few years, we will be even bigger and stronger.&quot; The exec said the company has &quot;ambitious plans&quot; for the future, but it values its independence. &quot;Independence is really appealing, it&#x27;s a kind of freedom,&quot; he said.

The update is in response to a recent wave of streamers using black censor bars or items to block their bodies, implying full or partial nudity.


Twitch notes, in a new blog post on the change, &quot;while most streamers have labelled this content appropriately with the Sexual Themes label and are wearing clothing behind the object or outside the camera frame, for many users, the thumbnails of this content can be disruptive to their experience on Twitch.&quot;

The most intriguing new detail is the targeting of the heretofore-unknown hardware feature, which proved to be pivotal to the Operation Triangulation campaign.

                              <span>Microsoft has revealed its first batch of Game Pass titles for January. 


Headlining this collection is Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla (Cloud, Console, and PC), which will be available from 9th January. In this instalment of Ubisoft&#x27;s assassin series, players take on the role of Viking raider Eivor Varinsdottir. 


Another highlight from this wave is Capcom&#x27;s remake of Resident Evil 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC), which arrives on 16th January. Nothing says new year&#x27;s cheer like fighting off waves of flesh-eating zombies.

                              <span>Nightmare Forge Games has changed the name of horror game Infestation 88 after speculation that the number in its title was a Neo-Nazi symbol.


Originally titled Infestation 88 and later stylised as &#x27;88, the studio has now removed the number entirely from its name. The game, which had its debut trailer earlier this week after the original Steamboat Willie Disney cartoon entered the public domain, is now known as Infestation: Origins.


The studio has since stated the number 88 was originally chosen for its &quot;symmetrical design&quot; and insisted any connection with Neo-Nazi connotations was unintentional.

                              <span>Ukrainian studio Frogwares is now the sole publisher of Lovecraft-inspired detective adventure The Sinking City. This follows the conclusion of a legal dispute with publisher Nacon, in which Frogwares accused the company of claiming copyright of The Sinking City after its release, withholding milestone payments, and owing the developer unpaid royalties.


The dispute between the two companies saw Frogwares attempting to remove The Sinking City from PC storefront Steam in a bid to sever its ties to Nacon. In February 2021, Frogwares then told people not to buy its game from Steam and the following month it issued The Sinking City with a DMCA takedown. At this time, it claimed Nacon had &quot;illegally&quot; uploaded a hacked version to Valve&#x27;s platform.


Now, Frogwares is the sole publisher of The Sinking City across all platforms. In a post appropriately shared on Steam, the studio said it was &quot;happy to put this whole thing behind&quot; it, and is now looking forward to &quot;sharing more news about the future of the franchise down the line&quot;.

                              <span>UPDATE 4/1/24: Disney Parks has updated its original promotional post, and now lists Star Wars Outlaws as arriving in 2024. It no longer gives a more specific timeframe.
As we reported yesterday, this post initially said Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming open world Star Wars game would arrive &quot;late this year&quot;.
The original story continues below.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming open world Star Wars game Outlaws looks to be set for a &quot;late&quot; 2024 release. 


Until today, the Ubisoft game held a much wider ranging 2024 release window. However, a Disney Parks blog post promoting a variety of events and such for the next 12 months has Star Wars Outlaws listed as arriving towards the tail end of the year. 


&quot;Star Wars Outlaws, the open world Star Wars game, is set to release late this year,&quot; the post reads (thanks, IGN). &quot;The game lets you explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. You can risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. If you&#x27;re willing to take the risk, the galaxy is full of opportunity.&quot;

                              <span>Rebellion co-founders Chris and Jason Kingsley have been recognised for their services to the economy as part of the King&#x27;s New Year Honours list. This recognition has seen the brothers each being awarded a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire).


The Kingsley siblings co-founded Rebellion, which is best known for the Sniper Elite series, in Oxford all the way back in 1992. Since its conception in the early 90s, the company has since expanded to include comic, book, board game, film and TV work under its umbrella. 


Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley called it an &quot;incredible honour&quot; to be awarded a CBE. &quot;It, in part, reflects the growth and success of Rebellion but also the wider UK games industry. Games are now the leading form of entertainment media,&quot; he wrote.

Called Infestation 88, this upcoming release is following in similar footsteps of slasher film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey and the horrifying Winnie&#x27;s Hole, and the more directly Steamboat Willie-inspired first-person shooter, Mouse, announced last year. This time, developer Nightmare Forge Games has taken an innocent and beloved children&#x27;s character and given it a sinister makeover. 


You can see a short teaser for it below.

Smith continued: &quot;I think the CMA vindicated its position but still created a pragmatic path forward for innovation and investment. I think that is good for everyone.&quot;

The award-winning RPG released on Microsoft&#x27;s consoles last month, however many have experienced issues getting their games to save. Both Microsoft and developer Larian acknowledged this following the game&#x27;s Xbox launch, but issues are still persisting weeks later. 


In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), Larian assured players Microsoft is working on an official fix for the game&#x27;s save issues, which it said are being caused by a firmware issue. However, due to the festive period, there is a reduced workforce, so things are taking longer than normal to smooth out.

First Contact Entertainment shared the news just before Christmas, via a statement on Facebook. &quot;After almost 8 years of working with the most amazing team I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of being part of, I&#x27;m sad to announce that we will be closing our company First Contact Entertainment by the end of the year,&quot; reads the statement.

After videos and screenshots showcasing the fighting game&#x27;s accessibility modes went viral over the festive period, colourblind players and accessibility advisers reached out to the Tekken team on social media alleging they fell ill with vertigo and migraines after testing the alternative modes.

                              <span>The ESRB has rated Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake.

As spotted by the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit community, the RPG has secured an E for Everyone rating from the North American rating board for its mild fantasy violence and mild suggestive themes, and there are &quot;no interactive elements&quot;.

&quot;This is an adventure role-playing game in which players help Mario rescue Princess Peach from an alien group,&quot; the website says. &quot;As players traverse whimsical worlds, they interact with characters and engage in turn-/puzzle-based combat against paper creatures. Players use various attacks (e.g., boot stomp, hammer strike, fire balls) against cartoony enemies that disappear into stars and coins.

Video game researcher Kurakasis took to Twitter/X earlier today to detail &quot;everything&quot; they know to date about the upcoming game, including a rumour that it will be an &quot;MMORPG to be precise&quot;. They also shared details of job listings that seem to confirm the game in development may be called &quot;Land of Salvation&quot;.

&quot;The game is now essentially confirmed to be in development, as an NCSoft employee posted a job listing on LinkedIn with a codename logo stylised similarly to the logo of Horizon games,&quot; Kurakasis said. &quot;It&#x27;s developed under the codename Project Skyline, with the initial codename being Project H.&quot;

&quot;I worked on [Call of Duty] for two years as a programmer at Demonware. Bobby&#x27;s decisions made our games worse,&quot; said Christina Pollock. &quot;In my first month, it came out he threatened to have an employee killed. In the all-hands [all staff meeting] that followed, no one wanted to speak first. So I demanded his firing in front of everyone.&quot;

In a candid thread on Twitter/X, Pollock said: &quot;I get that I am very loud and very annoying and that with my seniority and ease of other opportunities, that affords me certain protections and safety to do such things.

                              <span>&quot;Bobby [Kotick]&#x27;s decisions made our games worse,&quot; a former Call of Duty programmer said on social media the same day Kotick completed his final day as CEO at Activision Blizzard.

&quot;I worked on [Call of Duty] for two years as a programmer at Demonware. Bobby&#x27;s decisions made our games worse,&quot; said Christina Pollock. &quot;In my first month, it came out he threatened to have an employee killed. In the all-hands [all staff meeting] that followed, no one wanted to speak first. So I demanded his firing in front of everyone.&quot;

In a candid thread on Twitter/X, Pollock said: &quot;I get that I am very loud and very annoying and that with my seniority and ease of other opportunities, that affords me certain protections and safety to do such things.

                              <span>A slide allegedly taken from a Sony presentation has revealed how many units some of the company&#x27;s biggest first-party games have sold. 

The slide – which notably excludes other Sony first-party titles, including Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us series and Horizon Zero Dawn&#x27;s sequel, Horizon Forbidden West – reveals the sale figures for several games released since 2017, including Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man (2018), God of War (2018), and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020), which have sold 18.9 million, 15.9 million, and 12.6 million copies in their first two years, respectively. 

The same table, if true, also reveals that Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) sold 11 million copies, Gran Turismo Sport (2017) 7.8 million, Days Gone (2019) 7 million, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart (2021) 3.9 million, and &quot;Ghost Dir Cut&quot; – Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut (2021) – 3.3 million copies.

A now annual tradition, the news quiz sees us look back at some of the year&#x27;s more oddball news headlines and argue over who deserves the most points for remembering them. From 50 Cent to Heinz ketchup to a video game breaking the Geneva Convention - 2023 has had it all. But do you remember why?


Play along at home as we set Eurogamer&#x27;s news elves - Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan - 23 questions looking back over 2023. Good luck to you all - and a very happy new year!

That didn’t seem to matter much.
It guessed a campsite in Yellowstone to within around 35 miles of the actual location. The program placed another photo, taken on a street in San Francisco, to within a few city blocks.
Not every photo was an easy match: The program mistakenly linked one photo taken on the front range of Wyoming to a spot along the front range of Colorado, more than a hundred miles away. And it guessed that a picture of the Snake River Canyon in Idaho was of the Kawarau Gorge in New Zealand (in fairness, the two landscapes look remarkably similar)...</span>

Sqids (pronounced “squids”) is an open-source library that lets you generate YouTube-looking IDs from numbers. These IDs are short, can be generated from a custom alphabet and are guaranteed to be collision-free.

I haven’t dug into the details enough to know how they can be guaranteed to be collision-free.
As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                              <span>Apple is rolling out a new “Stolen Device Protection” feature that seems well thought out:
When Stolen Device Protection is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is required for additional actions, including viewing passwords or passkeys stored in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, turning off Lost Mode, erasing all content and settings, using payment methods saved in Safari, and more. No passcode fallback is available in the event that the user is unable to complete Face ID or Touch ID authentication.
For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple said there will be no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work...</span>

Headlined by tenth playable hero Rosa the High Court Chariot, the expansion also introduces a &quot;host of challenges, quality-of-life improvements, limited-time festive events, and much more&quot;.

Rosa can be unlocked by those willing to shell out for the Twinightmare Season Pass and is described as a &quot;formidable Hunter with high defensive capabilities, allowing her to survive even the toughest onslaught&quot;. Her Holy Domain Skill sees her transform into &quot;an unstoppable chariot, blazing a path through enemy hordes and afflicting them with a powerful curse&quot;.

Players can now battle alongside similarly ranked players in 1v1 and 3v3 matches and climb the ladder from Unranked status all the way to S rank, with 1v1 and 3v3 player battles boasting separate ranking systems.

&quot;FrostyFest update!&quot; exclaims Nintendo. &quot;Whether you spend your holidays having fun with friends, getting in family time, or kicking back by yourself, get ready to cast your vote in Splatoon 3 from 05/01 and splat it out from 13/01.&quot;

                              <span>A &quot;FrostyFest Update&quot; is coming to Splatoon 3 in the new year.

The next Splatfest will launch on 13th January, with the vote – which wants to know who you&#x27;ll be spending the holidays with; family, friends, or &quot;solo&quot;, which just seems like a nicer way of saying alone – running from 5th January until 13th.

&quot;FrostyFest update!&quot; exclaims Nintendo. &quot;Whether you spend your holidays having fun with friends, getting in family time, or kicking back by yourself, get ready to cast your vote in Splatoon 3 from 05/01 and splat it out from 13/01.&quot;

                              <span>Sega has detailed more of its plans to revive a swathe of classic game franchises, including Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Shinobi and Steets of Rage.


The announcement that Sega was working on new entries in the above series came as something of a suprise this month, and with few other details. 


Now, we know just a little more about each of the projects, and have a first glimpse at how they&#x27;ll presumably look.

On the spread of stolen material relating to Marvel&#x27;s Wolverine and other, upcoming game projects, Insomniac said it would share information &quot;when the time was right&quot;.

As a reminder, The Day Before only launched in early access on 7th December. This means its servers will only have been active for 48 days total - even shorter than Liz Truss&#x27; tenure as PM.

                              <span>China has announced new rules to limit the encouragement of spending in online video games, spooking investors in two of the world&#x27;s biggest publishers.


News of the limits wiped a combined ~$80bn from the value of Tencent and NetEase, China&#x27;s two main games publishers that now support or part-own many of the world&#x27;s biggest games companies.


Chinese online video games will now no longer be able to offer an extra incentive to spend in a game for the first time, or for spending repeatedly, Reuters reported.

Arion Kurtaj, now 18, was part of the Lapsus$ hacking group behind similar attacks on Nvidia, Uber and BT, among others.


Kurtaj hacked Rockstar in September 2022, while already on bail for hacking charges and staying under police protection at a Travelodge, BBC News reported.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Wolverine is still years from release, but people are currently playing - and uploading footage - of an incomplete early development build found within the files stolen from Insomniac Games by ransomware hackers earlier this month. 


It&#x27;s remarkable to see an in-development game being played in this way - and I can&#x27;t think of a similar situation, at least in recent memory. The GTA 6 hack contained a mountain of development assets, yes, but nothing playable in this manner. 


Here, people have been able to access a test build of Wolverine akin to an internal demo meant for Insomniac and Sony, that features multiple sections of the game available to play and explore. Naturally, these sections are still incomplete and unpolished, but key gameplay mechanics and story moments are included.

Originally set to arrive on an unspecified date this year, publisher 505 Games said that it and Kojima Productions had now decided to move the release into 2024.


&quot;We just need a little more time,&quot; 505 wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, earlier today.

                              <span>If you find yourself thinking, &quot;you know what, I feel more like grazing a big Smörgåsbord of culinary delights rather than taking on a herd of Grazers with Aloy right now&quot;, then I have good news. There is an official Horizon cookery book in the works. 


Known as Tastes of the Seven Tribes, this book will allow you to whip up a batch of spicy Fireclaw stew or even some Bitterbrew Boar (which is described as &quot;mouth-watering&quot;). 


It&#x27;s coming from Insight Editions, Rick Barba and prolific recipe writer Victoria Rosenthal, whose name you may recognise from a myriad of other video game related cookery books such as God of War&#x27;s Official Cookbook of the Nine Realms and the Donlan-approved Destiny cookbook.

                              <span>Epic Games Store has relaxed its content guidelines for publishers to allow games which have been rated Adults Only by the ESRB, so long as the rating has only been applied due to the presence of blockchain technology.
The subtle changes were noticed two days ago on 19th December, when Epic announced two games, Gods Unchained and Striker Manager 3, have been relisted on its storefront. Both games were removed from the store after they received an Adults Only rating from the ESRB in the USA.
Previously, Epic banned all games with an Adults Only rating from its store but has openly welcomed blockchain games. In order to allow Gods Unchained and Striker Manager 3 back onto its store, Epic has tweaked its policies on prohibited content.

The epilogue will be available to players once they complete the main quests of the DLC&#x27;s two adventures, The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk, and a &quot;certain&quot; postgame event in the base game.
Fans are speculating what the epilogue might contain and are hoping to see Nemona, Penny, and Arven from the base game added to the DLC. However, for fans who are too impatient to wait, the epilogue has already been datamined and shared online.

This is not a rare occurence, as War Thunder players have become known for uploading military documents to win arguments against other players or to argue developer Gaijin Entertainment over the realism of the vehicles. It&#x27;s happened again, not once but twice last week.
On 11th December, one user posted training material for the Norinco VT-4 tank (as reported by Cyber Daily). On 12th December, a user posted a manual for the M2A2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle (as reported by Task and Purpose).

The character - now just named Ivy - returns in Suicide Squad with a radically changed appearance following her apparent demise in 2015&#x27;s Arkham Knight. (As a reminder, Suicide Squad is a canonical follow-up to the Arkham series, also developed by Rocksteady).


Rocksteady debuted Ivy&#x27;s new appearance via an extended look at the character in a fresh developer diary, which you can watch below.

While many of us will likely be setting our sights on a bottle of Baileys and novelty Christmas pudding shaped confectionery, Bethesda is still all business, and has laid out its Starfield plans for 2024. 


In a new blog post, Bethesda promised to provide &quot;updates roughly every six weeks starting in February&quot;.

                              <span>Controversial Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick will depart the company on 29th December, it&#x27;s been announced. 


Kotick&#x27;s reign lasted 32 years, during which time the company became one of the biggest and most influential video games publishers on the planet. 


His departure this month is not unexpected - Activision Blizzard had previously confirmed Kotick&#x27;s presence only until the end of this year to &quot;ensure a smooth and seamless integration&quot; following  Microsoft&#x27;s long-winded but ultimately successful $68.7bn acquisition. Now, we know exactly when Kotick leaves and how the company will be shaped without him.

On behalf of the Structured Logging Working Group
and SIG Instrumentation,
we are pleased to announce that the contextual logging feature
introduced in Kubernetes v1.24 has now been successfully migrated to
two components (kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager)
as well as some directories. This feature aims to provide more useful logs
for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes.
What is contextual logging?
Contextual logging
is based on the go-logr API.
The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller
and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger.
The binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries.
The go-logr API is designed arou…</span>

The game is currently codenamed R and is planned for an official reveal in 2025, according to Bloober&#x27;s press release about the partnership (in Polish).
The press release does not state which of Skybound&#x27;s franchises Bloober will create a game for. Skybound is most known for the comic series The Walking Dead, which was created by Skybound co-founder Robert Kirkman in 2010. Skybound established its subsidiary Skybound Games in 2018 to publish and license video games.

Sony announced the milestone today, and said PS5 had passed the 50m mark earlier this month, on 9th December. 


That means PS5 took 160 weeks and 2 days to reach the 50m milestone - just one week longer than PS4, despite severe sales constraints for much of its early lifecycle.

This page has raised some eyebrows, however, as the game is listed there as &quot;The Suika Game&quot; and not &quot;Suika Game&quot;. The game&#x27;s original developer is also not mentioned.


The original Suika Game was developed by Aladdin X and, so far, it has only been released on the Nintendo eShop, though many browser versions and clones on other platforms have since popped up.

In an interview with MinnMax, Walters detailed the various factors involved in his departure, from the desire to work on something brand new and not feeling able to within BioWare or EA, to the positive experience of working on the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition trilogy remaster with a small and &quot;scrappy&quot; team acting as a reminder of his early days at the studio and serving as a positive moment to make his exit.


Discussing the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition project, Walters described its approval by EA as something relatively &quot;unplanned&quot;, compared to the careful assignment of teams long in advance to work on the studio&#x27;s typical fare: mammoth big budget RPGs. This led to a different way of working which brought back fond memories, he said.

The veteran MMO will receive three content updates between January and the launch of The War Within, which looks set to arrive around late summer/early autumn next year. 


These updates will tie up loose story threads from the game&#x27;s previous expansion Dragonflight, and tease what comes next.
