Nexus says that whilst the mod&#x27;s removal was &quot;not a political statement or an alignment to one side or the other in the culture war&quot;, it reserved the right &quot;not to host&quot; the mod on its platform.

&quot;Hosting this mod was not for us and it is certainly within our rights not to host content on our platform,&quot; NexusMods told 404 Media.

                              <span>NetherRealm has deployed a day-one patch for Mortal Kombat 1 on consoles and Switch.

The patch notes reveal that for both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, improvements include &quot;fleshed out&quot; accessibility options – see below – as well as character &quot;polish and tuning&quot;, &quot;improved and refined&quot; UI, and the addition of &quot;numerous finishing moves&quot;.

There are also some tweaks to the online system, including improvements to the matchmaking and &quot;online mode bugs&quot;, with the story campaign getting a little TLC, too, including movie player improvements, 4K resolution, the tuning of &quot;story finale and final boss&quot;, plus a liberal application of &quot;visual polish&quot; to a number of cinematic sequences.

                              <span>Women in Games has set the theme for its upcoming annual conference: Disruption.

&quot;Asking direct questions to look forward and build a better, progressive future for women in games and esports around the world&quot;, the online conference will take place on 10th October, 2023. Tickets cost £30.

&quot;From questions based on original research about representation such as &#x27;What&#x27;s going wrong with women&#x27;s dialogue in video games?&#x27;, to questions from returning innovators about pay such as &#x27;Salary Transparency: Breaking the Game or Path to Success?&#x27;, the Women in Games Annual Global Conference will offer abundant challenges to the prevailing lack of fairness, whether that be in work or play environments,&quot; a press release says.

                              <span>Warhammer has dropped an all-new Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin teaser that details how it plans to &quot;deliver a truly comprehensive RTS game at launch&quot;.

Not only do we get to see Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin&#x27;s map editor in action, where you can use developer-like tools to craft your own multiplayer maps, but also the Army Livery, which lets you customise the colour palettes for each of your four factions with paints from Games Workshop&#x27;s Citadel collection and &quot;underlines Frontier’s efforts to create the most authentic game possible&quot;.

But why just read about it when you can see it for yourself? Check out the four-minute overview video below:

                              <span>Payday 3 developer Starbreeze has confirmed the upcoming heist shooter will not have the controversial DRM system Denuvo. 

In a concise update posted to Steam, Starbreeze simply said hello to its heisters and revealed in no-nonsense terms that &quot;Denuvo is no longer in Payday 3&quot;.

The update comes a few weeks after fans shared screenshots within the Payday subreddit that intimated Payday 3 would feature the controversial anti-piracy software. Two months later, however, the Steam storefront has been updated, and Denuvo is no longer listed (thanks, PC Gamer).

                              <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn has banned over 2000 accounts for cheating as it gets set for next week&#x27;s Harbingers Collection Event.

In a note posted to X/Twitter, the studio said it had identified and removed &quot;2000+&quot; cheaters and reminded players to &quot;report any suspicious player activity through [its] in-game tools&quot;.

The Harbingers Collection Event – which sees our Legends &quot;gear up to fight the end of the world&quot; – launches on all platforms on 19th September and includes Living Shell Trios, World’s Edge After Dark, and the usual cosmetics.

                              <span>Tired of that giant white slab of a PlayStation 5 in your living room and looking to add a bit of pizzazz to your surroundings? Well then Sony might just, depending on your idea of tasteful, have what you&#x27;re looking for: three new metallic console covers (and matching controllers) that are almost certainly not going to match your existing decor!


Sony&#x27;s newly announced Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, and Sterling Silver cover/controller combos are, according to a post on the PlayStation Blog, inspired by the &quot;beautiful and powerful hues found in the depths of planet Earth&quot; - all of which have then bee &quot;elevated&quot; with a metallic finish for a &quot;touch of sophistication.&quot;


Those interested in giving their PS5 a &quot;Deep Earth&quot; makeover can, when the appropriate time comes, pick up each of the three shiny new covers for £49.99/€59.99/$59.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers (sold separately) will each cost £64.99/€74.99/$74.99 USD.

                              <span>Frictional Games fans could be forgiven for thinking the horror-focused studio has been getting a little soft in recent years, having introduced death-free and monster-free modes in post-launch updates for its acclaimed SOMA and Amnesia: Rebirth. This year, though, it&#x27;s going in completely the opposite direction, and its recently launched WW1 horror Amnesia: The Bunker will be getting even more nerve-frayingly horrifying, just in time for Halloween.


As spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun, Frictional&#x27;s creative lead Fredrik Olsson has recently been using social media to detail some of the delightfully sadistic new features coming to Amnesia: The Bunker soon in what will known as Shell Shocked mode.


For starters, players who&#x27;ve been relying on the comparative tranquility of The Bunker&#x27;s Admin Office safe room to emotionally, physically, and mentally regroup will, in Shell Shocked mode, be a little bit screwed. Now, its reassuringly sturdy steel doors will be replaced wood, which, you know, isn&#x27;t all that resistant to scrambling, pounding, shredding monster claws.

                              <span>Ubisoft Montreal - the studio behind the likes of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Far Cry 5 - has been accused of leaving staff in &quot;turmoil&quot; after it reportedly reneged on promises that &quot;100% remote work would be possible&quot;, forcing all 4,000 of its workers back to the office for a &quot;minimum&quot; of two days a week, as of 11th September.


Back in June 2021, Ubisoft announced it would be adopting a &quot;hybrid and tailored approach to work arrangements&quot; where staff would be able &quot;to balance in-office work with work from home&quot;. However, according to a new report by IGN, Ubisoft Montreal staff were repeatedly told they could remain 100% remote long-term, leading many to make significant life decision or accept jobs at the company based around these assurances.


&quot;100% remote work will be possible depending on various criteria,&quot; reads an internal Ubisoft document seen by IGN and detailed in its report, &quot;such as productivity and impact on the team, as well as the nature of the work being done.&quot;

                              <span>American Truck Simulator trundles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has now confirmed its next stop (after the already announced but not-yet-released stops of Kansas and Nebraska, that is) will be the state of Arkansas.


This marks something of an interesting (I realise your mileage may vary on this point) deviation for SCS, which has so far been making its way across the US map in a bottom-to-top, left-to-right fashion, starting with California. This latest news means once Kansas and Nebraska are released, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Louisiana will be missing from the expected progression.


Arkansas, the so-called Natural State (mine is &quot;asleep&quot;), will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 16th state when it arrives at some currently undisclosed future point, and SCS Software&#x27;s rendition promises everything from &quot;stunning mountain vistas to towering forests&quot;.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 7 bad boy Sephiroth will be fully playable in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.


A new release date trailer for the game was shown at last night&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, which included a shot of Cloud and Sephiroth together in battle. In a follow-up interview on the PlayStation Blog, creative director Tetsuya Nomura confirmed Sephiroth will be playable.


&quot;If you played the original Final Fantasy 7, I&#x27;m sure you can guess which scene I&#x27;m talking about,&quot; he said. &quot;You will be able to control Sephiroth in the same scene in this title as you did in the original.&quot;

                              <span>As revealed in PlayStation&#x27;s recent State of Play, Honaki: Star Rail is coming to PS5 on 11th October, 2023.


Developed by HoYoverse, the company behind Genshin Impact, Star Rail is an anime-styled turn-based RPG with a gacha system, and has already been in the hands of PC and mobile players for five months.


While Star Rail is a free download, you can purchase its PS5 &quot;pre-order&quot; bundle for £9.49 to get some in-game items when it releases, and the ability to pre-download the game on PS5. But these in-game items are fairly unhelpful in the grand scheme of getting and building characters, especially when compared to its battle pass, the &quot;Nameless Honor&quot;, which upgrades its free track to premium for £9.99 and offers far more helpful materials and weapons.

                              <span>Ascendant Studios, the developer behind the EA published Immortals of Aveum, has laid off almost half of its staff.


Ascendant CEO Bret Robbins shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating 45 percent of the team have been let go - a &quot;painfully difficult, but necessary decision that was not made lightly&quot;.


According to a report from Polygon, around 40 people were laid off, with one former employee claiming poor sales of Immortals of Aveum was a key reason.

                              <span>The wait is almost over (sort of)! Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth - the second instalment in Square Enix&#x27;s three-part Final Fantasy 7 remake - will be coming to PlayStation 5 on 29th February next year.


We&#x27;ve had a couple of glimpses of Rebirth since its announcement back in June 2022, and we know it&#x27;ll unsurprisingly be picking up the story from 2020&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 Remake and later InterMISSION DLC - although &quot;preparations&quot; are being made to help you catch up if you can&#x27;t be bothered to play through either of those beforehand.


&quot;After escaping from the dystopian city of Midgar,&quot; developer Square Enix explains, &quot;Cloud and his friends set out on a journey across the planet. New adventures await in a vibrant and vast world – sprint across grassy plains on a Chocobo and explore expansive environments.&quot;

                              <span>During this evening&#x27;s Sony State of Play, Insomniac Games revealed some more information about next month&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 ahead of its release on 20th October.

The game&#x27;s map has almost doubled in size, with the addition of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City. To help Peter and Miles swing across the larger map, they can now use web wings to traverse faster. The game uses a new fast travel system which is unlocked through the district progress systesm, and Insomniac says players will experience &quot;very little downtime&quot; when using fast travel.
The HUD for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 looks more organic, as markers for activities and quests players have already discovered will appear across New York City. This is explained in-game as AR technology in the lenses of the Spider-Masks which, given the technology already used by characters in the Spider-Man universe, Peter and Miles probably sorely need.

Separate Ways, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, was introduced to Resident Evil 4 when the game made the jump from GameCube to PlayStation 2 in 2005. It focuses on enigmatic spy Ada Wong, who briefly pops up in the Leon S. Kennedy-starring main campaign - filling in the blanks of her whereabouts over the course of the story.


A Resident Evil 4 Remake version of Separate Ways was first spotted by dataminer Gosetsu back in March, and Capcom has now made it official, confirming it&#x27;ll release for $9.99 USD - alongside a free update to Resident Evil 4&#x27;s wave-based Mercenaries mode introducing Ada Wong and Albert Wesker - on 21st September.

                              <span>Big times are coming for Cyberpunk 2077, with its paid expansion and a significant 2.0 base game overhaul both right around the corner; we already knew the expansion, Phantom Liberty, was coming on 26th September, but developer CD Projekt has now confirmed its free 2.0 update will arrive five days earlier, on 21st September.


Cyberpunk 2.0 aims to address some of the criticism levied at the game since its controversial launch at the tail-end of 2020, promising completely redesigned skill trees and perks, revamped cyberware, a new capacity system, vehicle combat and car chases, combat AI improvements, and a new police system. It also brings changes to loot, items, and crafting, as well as UI and UX improvements, and a new selection of radio stations.


In other words, Cyberpunk&#x27;s 2.0 update touches on a broad range of core systems in a significant fashion - and CD Projekt has been attempting to explain how these changes will impact the experience across a recent series of developer streams.

                              <span>Ready for more announcements? State of Play, Sony&#x27;s own version of the Nintendo Direct, returns tonight at 10pm UK time. If you&#x27;re over the pond that&#x27;s 5pm Eastern, or 2pm Pacific. 


Today&#x27;s State of Play is focused on &quot;previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles&quot;, including PlayStation VR2, Sony said yesterday - so don&#x27;t expect any big new reveals. Specifically, these will be for third-party games - so don&#x27;t plan for any of Sony&#x27;s own internal studios to pop up either. 


There&#x27;s still plenty that could feature, though - including Square Enix games such as Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth and also Foamstars. What are you hoping to see?

                              <span>In the wake of its hugely controversial engine pricing changes, Unity has closed a number of its offices over what it has called a &quot;potential threat&quot;.


News of the temporary closures first began circulating earlier today as Unity employees shared the news on social media. &quot;Hey y&#x27;all, just a reminder to think before you target Unity employees,&quot; senior XR product designer Javier Busto wrote. &quot;This morning we learned that law enforcement notified several Unity offices of credible threats.&quot;


Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier later elaborated on those initial reports, writing that a &quot;credible death threat&quot; had resulted in the closer of two Unity offices - in San Francisco and Austin, Texas - as well as the cancellation of a town hall meeting that would have seen Unity CEO John Riccitiello addressing staff following Tuesday&#x27;s widely lambasted pricing changes.

With technology like that on Mr. Leyvand’s head, Facebook could prevent users from ever forgetting a colleague’s name, give a reminder at a cocktail party that an acquaintance had kids to ask about or help find someone at a crowded conference. However, six years later, the company now known as Meta has not released a version of that product and Mr. Leyvand has departed for Apple to work on its Vision Pro augmented reality glasses.

The technology is here. Maybe the implementation is still dorky, but that will change. The social implications will be enormous...</span>

                              <span>A fresh report into Unity&#x27;s hugely-controversial decision to start charging developers when their games are downloaded has thrown fresh light on the situation.

MobileGamer sources say Unity has already offered some studios a 100% fee waiver - if they switch over to Unity&#x27;s own LevelPlay ad platform. 


The report quotes industry consultants that say this move is an &quot;attempt to destroy&quot; Unity&#x27;s main competitior in this field: AppLovin.

The Direct&#x27;s line-up, including an F-Zero 99 announcement,  and big finale, a port of the beloved Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, were fan-pleasing additions to the Switch&#x27;s bulging catalogue.


And they are perhaps the kind of smaller announcements we&#x27;d expect at this point, for a platform widely-expected to be replaced next year. Still, as we saw, there&#x27;s plenty of life left for the next six months at least - and beyond?

A enhanced version of Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 (originally titled Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon when it launched for 3DS back in 2013) was initially unveiled in June, but today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct offered a substantially longer look at its spooky ghost-hoovering action.


The twist in Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the original, is that it plays out across not just one ghost-infested haunted dwelling, but five - starting with the kind of classic spook house seen in its GameCube predecessor, and continuing through the likes of a former research lab, run-down clock factory, snowy mine, and more.

Announced at today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct as the final reveal, this will be a spruced up version of the GameCube classic - and best game in the Paper Mario series.


Originally released in 2004, it continues the paper origami style of the first N64 game but with new abilities and an expansive story.

                              <span>Nintendo and developer Cing&#x27;s wonderful (if upsettingly short-lived) Another Code series is making a return, arriving on Switch as two-game bundle in January next year.


Another Code Recollection, as this new version is officially known, features a shiny new remake of Another Code: Two Memories (known as Trace Memory in the US), which launched for Nintendo DS back in 2005.


Here, players take on the role of 13-year old Ashley Mizuki Robbins as she searches for her father on the fictional Blood Edward Island - all with a little bit of help from her ghostly friend D.

Based on its Nintendo Direct reveal, Mario vs. Donkey appears to be a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance original (Nintendo referred to this Switch release as an &#x27;updated&#x27; version), and will once again see Mario puzzling his way across various puzzle-based platform stages to rescue the mini-Marios.


The goal each level is to retrieve a key and get it to the exit, requiring both observation and brain work to navigate the obstacles using levers, platforms, and other wrinkles to grab the mini-Marios and progress to the next area.

We got our first look at Broken Roads a couple of years ago, when it was aiming for a 2022 release. The game&#x27;s launch was pushed back a year, during which Drop Bear Bytes partnered with publisher Versus Evil.

Inspired by classic single-player CRPGs, Broken Roads follows a group of companions as they make their way across a post-apocalyptic imagining of Australia.

&quot;Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into the development on our new title,&quot; Mega Crit wrote on X, formerly Twitter, &quot;we will be migrating to a new engine unless the changes are completely reverted and TOS [Terms of Service] protections are put in place.

                              <span>Stig Asmussen, the director behind the acclaimed Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, is leaving Respawn Entertainment and EA to &quot;pursue other adventures&quot;.


Asmussen, whose career in the games industry spans close to 25 years, worked on all three original God of War titles at Santa Monica Studio prior to his move to Respawn - serving as lead environment artist, then art director, and, finally, creative director on God of War 3. 


He joined Respawn Entertainment as a game director in 2014, and his first released project at the studio was 2019&#x27;s well-received Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. A follow-up, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, also helmed by Asmussen, released earlier this year, proving to be a commercial hit.

                              <span>State of Play, Sony&#x27;s irregular series of PlayStation showcases, is returning tomorrow, 14th September, with a focus on previously announced indie and third-party games.


Sony hasn&#x27;t yet indicated how long this latest broadcast is likely to last, but things kick off at 10pm tomorrow in the UK/11pm CEST/2pm PT/5pm ET.


Anyone hoping for some juicy first-party news - or even another quick look at Spider-Man 2: Spider-Mens - should temper their expectations. &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s broadcast will focus on updates to previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles,&quot; says the PlayStation Blog.

                              <span>Mojang&#x27;s annual livestream celebration of Minecraft, the appropriately titled Minecraft Live, is returning on Sunday, 15th October, with the promise of news, future teases, and - as is now customary - another vote to decide on a new mob for the game.


Proceedings get underway at 6pm in the UK/1pm EDT, and viewers can expect around an hour of chat - which will include &quot;on-the-horizon news and updates&quot; - covering both Minecraft and this year&#x27;s action-strategy spin-off, Minecraft: Legends.


As for this year&#x27;s community mob vote (mobs, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Minecraft parlance, are basically enemies), it&#x27;ll offer a choice between three new mobs - which Mojang will reveal at the &quot;beginning of October&quot; - and take place via the Minecraft Launcher, Minecraft.net, or the special event server on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

An app with the name Signal Plus Messenger was available on Play for nine months and had been downloaded from Play roughly 100 times before Google took it down last April after being tipped off by security firm ESET. It was also available in the Samsung app store and on signalplus[.]org, a dedicated website mimicking the official Signal.org. An app calling itself FlyGram, meanwhile, was created by the same threat actor and was available through the same three channels. Google removed it from Play in 2021. Both apps remain available in the Samsung store...</span>

                              <span>With last week&#x27;s Starfield launch slowly simmering down, Bethesda has started to cast its gaze forward, confirming a number of &quot;community requested&quot; features are on the way, including Nvidia DLSS support on PC, an FOV slider, and more.


As detailed on Bethesda&#x27;s website, the studio is initially targeting a &quot;few top issues&quot; in a small hotfix out today, after which it&#x27;ll be turning its attention to various community requested features, which will arrive in updates at a &quot;regular interval&quot;.


Specifically, it&#x27;s confirmed Nvidia DLSS Support on PC following its controversial partnership with AMD, as well as 32:9 ultrawide monitor support on the platform. Additionally, players can expect a range of quality of life improvements, including a field-of-view slider, an HDR calibration menu, plus brightness and contrast controls. Oh, and also, more convenient, efficient consumption through the power of a new &quot;Eat&quot; button for food.

This is an accessibility feature to allow two controllers to be used at once, meaning players can help others by playing games collaboratively.


This is just one of a suite of features as part of this new update, which is available to download today globally. Another is the addition of support for larger-capacity SSDs  - now up to 8TB.

The company has subsequently softened its stance slightly on a couple of aspects - but fury across the industry remains.

Behind the scenes, CEO John Riccitiello shifted 2000 shares last week on 6th September, as noted by Yahoo Finance, which noted this move was part of a trend over the past year where the exec has sold more than 50,000 shares in total and bought none.

                              <span>Recent Square Enix games have misfired due to the approach of each game being &quot;a single producer&#x27;s fiefdom&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to a new report from Bloomberg, detailing a recent drop in stock value of the company compared to its closest rival Capcom, though stock over the past couple of years has fluctuated but appears relatively stable. It&#x27;s claimed this recent drop is due to underwhelming sales of Final Fantasy 16, though it also follows the disappointing Forspoken and a number of smaller games released at the tail-end of last year that failed to make much of an impression.


Bloomberg sources include current and former Square Enix employees who remain anonymous, but stated the company&#x27;s approach is to give each project a single producer.

                              <span>Following yesterday&#x27;s news that Unity will begin charging per game install, indie developers have taken to social media to make their fury heard.


Unity shared a blog post detailing plans of a new business model where a monthly fee per new game install will be set from 1st January next year. In a statement following the blog post, the game engine creator insisted the change will &quot;only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users&quot;.


However, a huge number of games are built using Unity tools, so the reaction to this change has been met with widespread criticism.

                              <span>Game development engine Unity has U-turned on some parts of its hugely controversial plan to enforce fees on game creators every time someone downloads their work, following widespread backlash. 


Unity told Axios last night it had &quot;regrouped&quot; to further discuss some of the issues raised by game developers, and made some concessions.


Initially, Unity planned to charge game developers a small fee every time a user installed a Unity game (beginning at the start of 2024, subject to the project meeting certain thresholds). Now, Unity said, this charge would only come after a user first installed a game.

                              <span>Over a year after Beauty and the Beast&#x27;s Belle first starting popping up in promotional images for developer Gameloft&#x27;s Disney Dreamlight Valley, the avid book-reader, Gaston-snubber, and dinner-enjoyer will be joining the village sim today, 13th September.


Belle will be accompanied by her furry boyfriend Beast, and both will be introduced though a new Realm adventure set in the Beast&#x27;s castle, with new Friendship Quests and items becoming available once the pair move village-ward.


Additionally, players who&#x27;ve been progressing through Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s overarching story will be able to settle The Forgotten into the Valley over a series of quests, and - good news for the completionists out their (hello, it&#x27;s me) - the spooky candy event is back from 24th October to 1st November, meaning you can tidy up any seasonal Dreamlight Duties you missed last year.

                              <span>EA has launched another of its Behind the Sims showcases at the internet, this one bringing confirmation that The Sims 5 - or codename Project Rene as it&#x27;s officially known at present - will indeed be a free-to-play game, as previously leaked, and will coexist alongside The Sims 4. Oh, and there was also some news on The Sims 4&#x27;s first Stuff Pack in over two-and-a-half years.


First, though, Project Rene and the news it&#x27;ll definitely be free-to-play - or as EA is more insistently phrasing it, &quot;free-to-download&quot;. Either way, the important thing here is that no core game purchase will be required, and EA is also keen to add there&#x27;ll be no subscription and no &quot;energy mechanics&quot; - so that&#x27;s at least one predatory mobile monetisation tactic off the table.


As to what a new mainline Sims game designed from the ground-up to be free-to-play might look like, a Project Rene job listing hastily removed from EA&#x27;s website earlier this year pointed to an in-game marketplace featuring official and user-generated content (both free and paid) - something else EA has now more or less confirmed.

                              <span>Apple has revealed its new iPhone 15 line-up, bringing the news that its ray-tracing-enabled iPhone 15 Pro will be getting native versions of some AAA titles - including Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil 4 Remake and Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage - over the next 12 months.


The newly unveiled iPhone 15 starts at £799 with 128GB storage, and features a 6.1&quot; Super Retina XDR display (bumped up to 6.7&quot; if you opt for the £899 &quot;Plus&quot; model), an aluminium body, the A16 Bionic Chip with 5-core GPU, and a 4x optical dual camera system capable of taking photos at up to 48MP. It&#x27;ll also ditch Apple&#x27;s proprietary Lighting port in favour of USB-C to comply with upcoming EU regulations. 


The pricier iPhone 15 Pro model (starting at £999 with 128GB storage) is where things get a little more interesting for gaming. Its specs are broadly similar to the standard model (the £1,199 Pro Max even has the 6.7&quot; screen), but it switches in a 10x optical &quot;telephoto&quot; camera zoom, titanium body, and the A17 Pro chip with 6-core GPU.

                              <span>Unity has announced dramatic changes to its Unity Engine business model which will see it introduce a monthly fee per new game install beginning on 1st January next year - a move that has drawn considerable criticism from the development community.


Unity - the engine behind countless acclaimed games including Tunic, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Citizen Sleeper, RimWorld, Outer Wilds, Fall Guys, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Cities: Skylines - was previously licenced to developers using a royalty free model built around subscription tiers. Anyone whose revenue or funding was less than $100k over the course of the year (and who didn&#x27;t want access to features such as the ability to remove the Unity splash screen) could stick to the free Unity Personal licence, while a Unity Plus subscription was required up to $200k in revenue, and a Unity Pro or above subscription was needed for more.


As of 1st January, 2024, however, developers will be expected to pay an additional monthly Unity Runtime Fee per new game install - seemingly including re-installs and installs across multiple devices - on top of their existing licence subscription, with those fees kicking in for titles that have made $200k or more in the last 12 months and have at least 200k lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers, meanwhile, will see the fees applied after passing the $1m revenue and 1m lifetime installs threshold.

Citizen Lab says two zero-days fixed by Apple today in emergency security updates were actively abused as part of a zero-click exploit chain (dubbed BLASTPASS) to deploy NSO Group’s Pegasus commercial spyware onto fully patched iPhones.
The two bugs, tracked as CVE-2023-41064 and CVE-2023-41061, allowed the attackers to infect a fully-patched iPhone running iOS 16.6 and belonging to a Washington DC-based civil society organization via PassKit attachments containing malicious images.
“We refer to the exploit chain as BLASTPASS. The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim,” Citizen Lab ...</span>

Kubernetes v1.25 introduced support for user namespaces for only stateless
pods. Kubernetes 1.28 lifted that restriction, after some design changes were
done in 1.27.
The beauty of this feature is that:
it is trivial to adopt (you just need to set a bool in the pod spec)
doesn&#x27;t need any changes for most applications
improves security by drastically enhancing the isolation of containers and
mitigating CVEs rated HIGH and CRITICAL.
This post explains the basics of user namespaces and also shows:
the changes that arrived in the recent Kubernetes v1.28 release

Whilst the front shell is a deep purple, the back is white (similar to the design of Velocity Green which was released earlier this year). 
This is your standard Xbox controller, and has all the features you&#x27;d expect including textured bumpers and triggers, a dedicated Share button, and 3.5mm jack.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has announced a new collaboration running at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam from 28th September.
More information on what fans can expect is &quot;coming soon&quot;, as stated in the announcements from The Pokémon Company, though the teaser video for the event has some glimpses of what we might see. 
Pikachu and Eevee are shown running through a field of sunflowers, against a backdrop of countryside and windmills, before the animation transforms into the art style of an oil painting with Vincent Van Gogh&#x27;s signature brush strokes. Pikachu and Eevee turn to see the sunflowers have all turned into beaming Sunflora, and then we get a quick look at Van Gogh&#x27;s famous Sunflowers painting but with Sunflora taking centre stage.

A limited run physical edition will then launch in Europe just over a week later, on 23rd October, with some extra cosmetic packs and a physical map included. I do like physical maps!


Anyone who pre-orders gets an early access weekend from Friday 29th September to Monday 2nd October and yet more extra cosmetic bits and bobs.

                              <span>Since its release, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has gained praise for its execution of D&amp;D systems and the freedom allowed to players in roleplaying. And, like a reluctant DM, the game will warn you if you&#x27;re about to do something very silly, before watching you do the very silly thing and then say &quot;I warned you&quot;.
In Act 3, there are some important items required for the main storyline. You&#x27;re not supposed to get rid of these and there are some restrictions in place to prevent players from losing one of them, but as BOB_BestOfBugs on YouTube has discovered, that won&#x27;t stop a resourceful D&amp;D player. 
Warning: This article contains story spoilers for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, so turn back now to avoid those. Perhaps you&#x27;d prefer to read our combat tips guide or check out Digital Foundry&#x27;s impressions of the game on PS5 instead!

A new article from the New York Times explores the game&#x27;s recreation of the city and includes some brand new screenshots.


In particular, a screenshot of Times Square features sharper lighting and increased traffic density.

Luckily, one of the game&#x27;s more frustrating bugs - suddenly being unable to fire weapons - has a rather simple fix. All you need do is enter the game&#x27;s character customisation screen.
Players have been reporting this &quot;can&#x27;t shoot&quot; issue on reddit and Steam since Starfield was available in early access.

                              <span>XDefiant, the Tom-Clancy-adjacent free-to-play shooter from Ubisoft, has been delayed out of its previously planned summer window, with the publisher blaming certification issues on Xbox and PlayStation for the game&#x27;s slip into what&#x27;s now &quot;likely&quot; to be an October release.


XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division initially announced as Tom Clancy&#x27;s XDefiant back in 2021 before dropping its prefix - has had a number of closed Insider tests and open sessions throughout its development and was expected to get its full launch for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC some time this summer.


However, writing in a post on Ubisoft&#x27;s website, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin explained the game&#x27;s continuing lack of a release date can largely be blamed on complication arising during Microsoft and Sony&#x27;s certification processes for their respective consoles.

                              <span>Last time you got up from playing Xbox in your Xbox-branded onesie to grab yourself some food made with your Xbox-branded cookbook from your Xbox-branded mini-fridge, did you by any chance say to yourself, &quot;Gee, I really wish I&#x27;d been able to buy all this Xbox tat with an Xbox-branded credit card&quot;? Well, guess what? Anything is possible in this darkest of timelines.


The official Xbox credit card will soon be a thing, albeit only in the US for the time being, having been conjured into existence through a partnership between Microsoft and Mastercard. It&#x27;ll initially be available exclusively to Xbox Insiders (it&#x27;s expected to expand to all US-based Xbox players starting next year) and offers one of those reward-based scheme things, which - and I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a nicer way of putting this - essentially incentivises people to increase their debt, so, you know, please use responsibly and all that.


Basically, everyday purchases made on the card will steadily accrue points that can be spent on games and add-ons via Xbox.com, but an initial purchase using the card will also reward cardholders with 5,000 points (equating to $50 USD), plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Only new members are eligible for that three-month deal, incidentally, but it can be gifted to other people if you&#x27;re already a Game Pass subscriber yourself.

The Kubernetes development cycle is an evolving landscape with a myriad of tools seeking to streamline the process. Each tool has its unique approach, and the choice often comes down to individual project requirements, the team&#x27;s expertise, and the preferred workflow.
Among the various solutions, a category we dubbed “Local K8S Development tools” has emerged, which seeks to enhance the Kubernetes development experience by connecting locally running components to the Kubernetes cluster. This facilitates rapid testing of new code in cloud conditions, circumventing the traditional cycle of Dockerization, CI, and deployment.
In this post, we compare three solutions in this category: Telepresence, Gefyra, and our own contender, mirrord.

&quot;The base case is that Gearbox remains a part of Embracer,&quot; Gearbox chief communications officer Dan Hewitt told staff in an email seen by Bloomberg. &quot;However, there are many options under consideration, including Gearbox&#x27;s transfer, taking Gearbox independent, and others. Ultimately, we&#x27;ll move ahead with whichever path is best for both Gearbox and Embracer.&quot;


&quot;Nothing has been decided yet,&quot; Hewitt added, &quot;but there will be a lot of speculation in the coming weeks.&quot;

Sony announced a limited edition bundle for the upcoming Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, which includes a custom PS5 cover. The cover features black tendrils on a red background to represent the battle between Venom and Spider-Man, complete with a white spidey logo in the corner.

Dbrand&#x27;s version is aptly called Arachnoplates and is a close copy of Sony&#x27;s design, albeit with more intricate webbing in the design and no spiders in sight.

                              <span>FromSoftware has released an update for Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon that appears to be making its early game a little easier.


Patch 1.02 is now available to download across PC and consoles and makes some balance adjustments and bug fixes, typical of these sorts of updates. 


What&#x27;s more interesting, though, are adjustments to certain attacks by three bosses: Balteus, Sea Spider, and CEL240.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Black Flag - AKA the one where you get to be a pirate - is currently unavailable on Steam. But don&#x27;t get excited - it&#x27;s not because there&#x27;s a new version on the cards.


Black Flag&#x27;s disappearance from the Steam store prompted speculation from fans - fuelled by previous whispers - that Ubisoft had pulled the original version of the game ahead of the launch of its rumoured remake.


In response to those whispers, Ubisoft has now issued a statement saying the game was simply unavailable to buy right now due to a &quot;technical issue&quot;.

                              <span>Upcoming point-and-click adventure Foolish Mortals will now release in 2024.


Foolish Mortals is a &quot;merry and macabre&quot; Monkey Island-inspired adventure that takes place on the exotic locale of Devil&#x27;s Rock. Players take on the role of Murphy McCallan, as he seeks the treasure of Bellemore Manor. Of course, it won&#x27;t be easy, and McCallan will come across ghosts, voodoo and more during his adventures. 


Originally slated to release this year, creator David Younger of Inklingwood Studios shared news of the delay as part of a recent blog update. Here, Younger also teased some improvements coming to the game&#x27;s final release.

Over the weekend, following the game&#x27;s full release, it hit a peak of 330,723 concurrent players.


That&#x27;s bigger than Skyrim&#x27;s 287,411 concurrent player record, though still a way behind Fallout 4, which has a concurrent Steam player count of 472,962.

Mario Kart Tour originally launched for iPhone and Android devices four years ago, back in September 2019, and soon became one of Nintendo&#x27;s most lucrative mobile launches.

                              <span>The robot revolution began long ago, and so did the killing. One day in 1979, a robot at a Ford Motor Company casting plant malfunctioned—human workers determined that it was not going fast enough. And so twenty-five-year-old Robert Williams was asked to climb into a storage rack to help move things along. The one-ton robot continued to work silently, smashing into Williams’s head and instantly killing him. This was reportedly the first incident in which a robot killed a human; many more would follow.

The news comes via Window Central&#x27;s Jez Corden, who&#x27;s heard rumours that BioWare plans to &quot;ditch open world and go back to [the franchise&#x27;s] classic format&quot;.

Corden made the claim in the latest edition of his podcast, The Xbox Two Podcast, in a broader conversation about the pros of established studios sticking to the development blueprint that made their games so special versus the cons of taking risks and innovating, only for it to instantly crash and burn.

                              <span>Thinking about jumping into Starfield but worried about the levelling up grind? This player has a top tip for you.

YouTuber Maka91Productions has released a full guide about their clever way to maximise your XP. Admittedly, you won&#x27;t be able to get to it immediately – you&#x27;ll need some skill points and the Outpost Engineering skill to set it up, as well as be pretty comfortable with the game&#x27;s mechanics – but once you&#x27;ve a few hours under your belt, make sure you research power generation and resource extractors at a Research Laboratory.

How you configure your ship is just as important, too. As The Loadout notes, you should ensure your ship can carry 2000-3000 cargo space, and then make a beeline for these resources: Adaptive Frames (18), Aluminum (124), 2Beryllium (24), Copper (30), Fiber (2), Iron (99), and Tungsten (24) from Jemison Mercantile and the store on ship.

                              <span>Surprise! It looks like Gotham Knights is coming to Nintendo Switch.

Until now, the game has only been playable on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, but according to an update to the North American ratings board the ESRB, it looks like the action-RPG will shortly be making an appearance on Nintendo Switch, too.

As spotted by the eagle-eyed folks on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, nothing else about the rating listing has changed beyond the sneaky addition of &quot;Nintendo Switch&quot; to the platform list.

As reported by Vortex (thanks, @HazzadorGamin), the fire broke out at the team&#x27;s Prague office on Thursday and while, thankfully, no one was injured, the fire has devastated one of the three floors the studio uses, and now requires &quot;complete reconstruction&quot;.

When questioned by fans on Discord, GSC&#x27;s Mol1t confirmed the news.

&quot;Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition&quot; popped up on the IMDA&#x27;s website, having been approved for a &quot;M18&quot; – that&#x27;s a mature 18 – given its &quot;sexual references&quot;. The bundle includes both the base game and its expansion, Burning Shores.

&quot;Set on post-apocalyptic Earth, the protagonist, Aloy, travels to the west to discover the source of a mysterious signal and to find a way to restore Earth,&quot; the extended classification information explains (thanks, TryHard).

Developer Ironmace took to social media earlier this week to report that it was &quot;deploying servers with extra DDoS protection&quot;, taking the game offline for several hours to undertake emergency maintenance. 

But even after bringing the servers back up, players continued to report issues logging in, and Ironmace was still battling the denial of service attacks the following day.

Whilst Vincke has been incredibly taciturn about the possibility of additional Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 content - not least because Larian is currently occupied developing another title as well as managing Baldur Gate&#x27;s 3 post-launch activities and console ports – he did acknowledge that he&#x27;d been thinking about how DLC could complement Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, going so far as to hint that it didn&#x27;t even have to be constrained to an &quot;end-game&quot; event. 

In an interview with Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#x27; Todd Kenreck (embedded below), Vincke said that the idea of appending DLC could be &quot;very hard&quot; for the team, but conceded that it was &quot;not undoable&quot;.

                              <span>Donald Mustard, Fortnite boss and chief creative officer at Epic Games, has announced his retirement after 25 years in the games industry.


Mustard rose to prominence at Shadow Complex and Infinity Blade developer Chair Entertainment, a studio he co-founded in 2005. Chair was acquired by Epic Games in 2008 and Mustard would eventually become the company&#x27;s chief creative officer in 2016 - where he would oversee the meteoric rise of global video game phenomenon Fortnite.


Now, though, Mustard has announced his decision to move on from the company in a statement shared on social media, writing &quot;After an incredible adventure, I will be retiring from my role as chief creative officer at Epic this month.&quot;

                              <span>Saturnalia, the acclaimed survival horror from MirrorMoon EP developer Santa Ragione, is shaking off the shackles of Epic Games Store exclusivity and coming to Steam this October - and ahead of its launch, a 40-minute demo is now available on Valve&#x27;s platform.


Saturnalia - which Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin called a &quot;horrible nightmare in all the right ways&quot; in his Recommended review last year - whisks players away to the ancient, ever-shifting village of Gravoi, for an adventure heavily inspired by Sardinia folklore.


The goal here is to solve the mystery of the village and escape its confines, exploring and avoiding its horrors along the way. To aid in that atttempt, players can switch between four different characters at will, but should all of them die, the town will reassert itself, reconfiguring its labyrinthine layout for another attempt - albeit with narrative and puzzle progress retained.

                              <span>Game creation platform Roblox will belatedly launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5 in October. 


The hugely-popular title arrived for Xbox in 2015, following earlier releases on PC, iPhone and Android. A PlayStation launch has taken far longer to materialise, however, reportedly due to concerns from Sony&#x27;s Jim Ryan around the game&#x27;s popularity with children.


Comments made by Ryan in 2022 - surfaced this year as part of the FTC vs Microsoft trial - stated that PlayStation had historically been cautious around Roblox due to its millions of young users and &quot;anything that could potentially exploit them&quot;.

                              <span>Underground Blossom, the latest instalment in developer Rusty Lake&#x27;s surreal puzzle saga, has a release date: it&#x27;ll be careening through the tunnels of time and rolling into a distinctly Steam-shaped station on Wednesday, 27th September.


The Rusty Lake games, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, meld casual point-and-click puzzling with room-escape-style conundrums to tell a deliciously weird, loosely interconnected tale orbiting (to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the title) the lives of the Vanderboom family. The series generally falls into two camps; shorter, free-to-play offerings under the Cube Escape banner, and longer premium offerings that tend to be more substantial and more creatively ambitious.


Underground Blossom - which follows last year&#x27;s wonderfully inventive co-operative puzzler The Past Within - falls into the latter camp, this time taking players on a journey, via the Rusty Lake underground system, through the life and memories of Laura Vanderboom, who was introduced all the way back in the series&#x27; first outing, Cube Escape: Seasons.

                              <span>RuneScape developer Jagex is removing controversial pay-to-win aspects of its recently launched Hero Pass following an outcry from the game&#x27;s community.


At the start of the week, the Hero Pass was added to the MMORPG, which Jagex previously described as an &quot;always-on reward system&quot;. However, the reaction from players was overwhelmingly negative, in particular for pay-to-win options like purchasing Underworld Emblems or levels in the Hero Pass. This is in addition to other changes around content buffs and the Daily Challenge system.



Jagex yesterday released an update promising change. However the severity of player feedback meant the developer has now swiftly released another update, admitting: &quot;We messed up&quot;.

                              <span>Starfield officially launched out of early access on Wednesday, and so far, it seems to be the most bug-free game Bethesda has released. 


That being said, some little glitches have managed to slip through the cracks, and while there have been a few reports of crashes, most of these slips are actually really rather funny. 


So, as it is Friday, here is a little collection of amusing ways Starfield has star-failed, to put a smile on your face ahead of the weekend.

                              <span>Bethesda has discussed its decision not to include ground vehicles in Starfield - at least, not at the game&#x27;s launch.


Touch down on one of Starfield&#x27;s many planets and there are miles of planet to explore in each direction. But you&#x27;ll be doing this on foot, aided by your trusty jetpack. You can&#x27;t slide into a waiting dune buggy or landspeeder and jet across the Jundland Wastes, Luke Skywalker style.


This is by design, Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard has said, as it makes for a more authored experience.

                              <span>Starfield players are already having a lot of fun designing ships, but one player has managed to create the ultimate ship. It&#x27;s just ugly as hell.


As redditor Morfalath discovered, the AI in the game always aims for the middle of the player ship. The solution? Miss out the middle.


That&#x27;s why Morfalath created a ship that&#x27;s all corners and &quot;unbeatable&quot;.

That makes Starfield the &quot;biggest Bethesda game launch of all time&quot;, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter.


The suggestion is that a Bethesda game has never hit six million players in so quick a timeframe. On the one hand, it has done so with the help of Xbox Game Pass. On the other, it has done so without the PlayStation audience.

                              <span>Do you remember 1995&#x27;s 16-bit Disney platformer Gargoyles? Because I certainly don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m nearly as old as an actual gargoyle. But for those that do, and that hold the game (and indeed the cartoon it was based on) in high regard, Disney has confirmed its previously announced remaster will be coming to PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on 19th October.


Of course, if you&#x27;re not someone with fond memories for Gargoyles, that might be because it only ever officially released in North America, slapping onto the Sega Genesis (AKA the Mega Drive everywhere else) around the middle of the cartoon&#x27;s run. Wikipedia also tells me the well-received game was originally planned to release on Super Nintendo, before getting the chop.


Anyway, 28 years later, Gargoyles the game is returning in the form of Gargoyles Remastered, by Empty Clip Studios, featuring the ability to toggle between the original&#x27;s wonderfully characterful 16-bit visuals and a new art style said to be inspired by the cartoon, but which, to my eyes at least, doesn&#x27;t look to have anywhere near the same kind of charm.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 is gearing up to be a bit of a celebrity fest - what with the likes of JK Simmons, John Cena, and Megan Fox all putting in an appearance - but perhaps its most perfect addition is 80s action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, cameoing as Johnny Cage, whose in-game likeness has now debuted online courtesy of series co-creator Ed Boon and a bunch of chicken wings.


Boon, in an interesting marketing nuzzle-up, has appeared in the latest episode of First We Feast&#x27;s Hot Ones, in which famous folk attempt to gorge themselves on chicken wings dipped in an increasingly fiery selection of hot sauces without the tops of their heads flying off.


Boon&#x27;s 14-minute appearance includes (alongside some sweating and surprised mouth sounds) some breezy chatter about Mortal Kombat 1 and the history of the series, interspersed with bits of gameplay footage. Some of that takes the form of a brief - and by brief I mean barely five-seconds-long - in-game look at Van Damme, who appears around the 5:52 mark. To summarise, he pumps the air, flips the bird, and looks reasonably like a young Jean-Claude Van Damme.

                              <span>Back in June, reports began circlating that Google, fresh off its Stadia streaming flop, was looking to incorporate playable online games into YouTube. Well, we can now sling those reports onto the &#x27;correct&#x27; pile; testing for the tech giant new feature is officially underway.


The gist of Google&#x27;s new initiative, known as Playables, is that it&#x27;ll enable users to instantly play online games via YouTube&#x27;s website or iOS and Android apps - and now, as confirmed on its YouTube test features and experiments list (thanks 9to5google) testing is now live.


&quot;Playables are games that can be played directly on YouTube on both desktop and mobile devices,&quot; the company explains. &quot;If you&#x27;re part of this experiment, you&#x27;ll see a section on YouTube called &#x27;Playables&#x27; that will appear alongside other content on the home feed.&quot;

                              <span>Last March, just two weeks after GPT-4 was released, researchers at Microsoft quietly announced a plan to compile millions of APIs—tools that can do everything from ordering a pizza to solving physics equations to controlling the TV in your living room—into a compendium that would be made accessible to large language models (LLMs). This was just one milestone in the race across industry and academia to find the best ways to teach LLMs how to manipulate tools, which would supercharge the potential of AI more than any of the impressive advancements we’ve seen to date...</span>

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss today&#x27;s report by Eurogamer that Nintendo is showing Switch 2 tech demos to developers, including at Gamescom last month. The new hardware from the Big N now feels closer than ever - but when exactly will it arrive?

More importantly, perhaps - for any Nintendo console - is what Nintendo game will it launch alongside? Will Switch 2&#x27;s beefier specs be a smart time to finally launch Metroid Prime 4? Or does Nintendo go with the more mass market approach, and tap up its 3D Mario team? 
Finally, since it&#x27;s out and it&#x27;s probably going to be the biggest game of the year, we discuss the opening moments of Starfield - beyond the hour we all spend in the character creator. Joining me this week to share their thoughts on all that are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s Shigeru Miyamoto has shed more light on Charles Martinet&#x27;s new role as a Mario Ambassador. 


Last month, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, will no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo&#x27;s most recognisable mascot, after almost 30 years in the job. Instead, new voice talent will take over this role, starting with the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder later this year. Martinet, meanwhile, was announced to be starting a new position as a Mario Ambassador. 


Now, in a new video message, both Miyamoto and Martinet have shared more on this new role.

Reedpop, the owner of events such as PAX, EGX and websites such as Eurogamer.net, has now said it will not work on future iterations of E3, after previously partnering with the ESA to relaunch the show this year.

The ESA has also informed the Los Angeles Convention Centre, E3&#x27;s long-held home, it will not turn up there in 2024 - following an earlier report which stated the LA City Tourism Department did not expect the show to run there for the forseeable future.

The move comes after the Manchester United player&#x27;s recent loan to Spanish side Getafe, where he will play this season.


Greenwood was removed from Football Manager, EA Sports&#x27; FIFA and Konami&#x27;s eFootball after his arrest by police in January 2022 on suspicion of rape and assault. He was subsequently charged in October 2022 with attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour.

                              <span>Megan Fox is lending her voice and likeness to vampire Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. 


Last night, NetherRealm announced Nitara will return to the series as a playable character for the first time in almost 20 years. In a new video showcasing the blood-thirsty fighter, Fox said the character resonated with her, perhaps acknowledging her own penchant for a few drops of the red stuff. 


Nitara is &quot;evil but also good,&quot; Fox explained in the video, adding that she is &quot;trying to save her people&quot;. Fox said she had a lot of fun bringing her talents to Mortal Kombat 1, calling the series a &quot;staple&quot; on the gaming landscape. &quot;We did all grow up playing the game... it is one of the greatest video games of all time&quot;.

                              <span>In Cologne last month, Nintendo&#x27;s public Gamescom showfloor booth let you play Pikmin 4 and Super Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. But behind the scenes, the company had more up its sleeves. 


Developer presentations for Switch 2 took place behind closed doors, Eurogamer understands, with partners shown tech demos of how well the system is designed to run. 

One Switch 2 demo is a souped up version of Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, designed to hit the Switch 2&#x27;s beefier target specs. (To be clear, though - this is just a tech demo. There&#x27;s no suggestion the game will be re-released.)

Xbox boss Phil Spencer shared the news on X (formerly Twitter), adding: &quot;Thanks to all the players who helped us reach this great milestone and congrats to Bethesda Studios.&quot;


The game had already got off to an impressive start last week when it was released into early access for purchasers of the premium edition.

                              <span>Pikmin 4 is far from a difficult game. There&#x27;s no time limit you need to worry about, most resources can be perpetually collected, and the game is extremely forgiving about your ever-growing Pikmin death toll.


It&#x27;s easy enough to see Pikmin 4&#x27;s story properly to the end, with the toughest challenges being its platinum badges for Dandori side-missions. (It can be particularly tough with some of the Dandori battles against the AI, and especially tricky in that one, very long cave.


Tom is going through and collecting all of the platinum badges, to which I say godspeed, but ever since I finished Pikmin 4 I&#x27;ve been thinking about other ways I could challenge myself in the game. At time of writing, the speedrunning record for getting Pikmin 4&#x27;s true ending is just under two and a half hours, but it doesn&#x27;t take advantage of any area skips - it&#x27;s an exercise in Dandori mastery because there aren&#x27;t really any major glitches to take advantage of to begin with.

                              <span>Valve&#x27;s never-ending tinkering with Steam will soon see support for PlayStation&#x27;s DualSense and DualShock controllers bought to the fore, their compatibility set to be clearly listed on store and library pages starting this October.


That&#x27;s according to a developer-focused blog post revealing, among other things, that of the 87m Steam users who&#x27;ve played a game using a controller at least once, around 27 percent of those - up from 11 percent in 2018 - 
utilise either PS4&#x27;s DualShock or PS5&#x27;s DualSense.


To cater for these users, developers are now being asked to complete a questionnaire that&#x27;ll automatically rate a game&#x27;s DualShock/Sense compatibility based on the answers given.  Players can expect the results of these questions to clearly manifest as store-page guidance.

                              <span>All eyes might currently be on BigOl&#x27;Spacegame, but there&#x27;s plenty more happening behind-the-scenes at Bethesda, one of those things obviously being MachineGames&#x27; Indiana Jones project - which, depending how you choose to interpret four words from Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard, might just be gearing up for a proper reveal next year.


Bethesda announced it had an Indiana Jones game in the works - with Wolfenstein studio MachineGames at the helm - all the way back in January 2021, warning, &quot;It&#x27;ll be some time before we have more to reveal.&quot; And, true to its word, the project has remained shrouded in secrecy since - although we do at least now have confirmation, thanks to an FTC hearing testimony from Bethesda&#x27;s Pete Hines, that it&#x27;ll be releasing exclusively on Xbox and PC.


So with Bethesda&#x27;s Indy announcement steadily approaching its third anniversary, a persistent question has been, &quot;When will we see more?&quot;, and Todd Howard has now maybe teased - in an interview with Esquire - that the project will be getting a proper reveal sometime next year.

                              <span>Developer Gunfire Games has confirmed it&#x27;s readying a new update for its celebrated (and million-selling) Souls-like shooter sequel Remnant 2, promising that more quality of life updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, and a &quot;potato mode&quot; will be with players &quot;soon&quot;.


That news comes via Remnant 2 principal designer Ben Cureton, who shared a list of the upcoming patch&#x27;s headline features on social media. The aforementioned &quot;potato mode&quot; is, alas, unlikely to fulfil all your wildest, possibily erotic potato-slaying fantasies, more likely being some under-the-hood changes Gunfire has made to push Remnant 2&#x27;s settings below those previously allowed - hopefully meaning improved performance on lower-spec PCs.


Performance improvements have, of course, been a focus for Gunfire following Remnant 2&#x27;s slightly wobbly launch, and Cureton&#x27;s post makes it explicitly clear the incoming patch will include more. That comes alongside the introduction of toggle aim and hold sprint, &quot;dozens&quot; of enemy updates, material refund changes for weapon deconstruction, PlayStation icon selection, and proper EXP rewards for instances where Summons make the kills.

This is the result of a secret weapon criminals are selling access to online that appears to tap into an especially powerful set of data: the target’s credit header. This is personal information that the credit bureaus Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion have on most adults in America via their credit cards. Through a complex web of agreements and purchases, that data trickles down from the credit bureaus to other companies who offer it to debt collectors, insurance companies, and law enforcement...</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy 14 won&#x27;t be going free-to-play anytime soon.


Each new expansion of Square Enix&#x27;s MMORPG has extended its meme-worthy free trial to include more and more of the game. As announced recently at the Las Vegas Fan Fest, that free trial will be expanded to include Stormblood up to level 70 when next expansion Dawntrail is released next year.



But will the company ever reach a point where that free trial is extended to the full game? Director Naoki Yoshida told Eurogamer it won&#x27;t, though the free trial will likely be expanded further.

                              <span>With summer teetering on the precipice, threatening to tumble into a rainy, windswept autumn any day now, EA is wisely hedging its bets with its two newly announced The Sims 4 Kit packs - both arriving Thursday, 7th September - giving us sun, fun, and swimwear on one side, and resolutely indoor luxury living on the other.


The Sims 4&#x27;s Poolside Splash Kit, obviously enough, is all about appropriate attire for those lazy afternoons spent lounging with a margarita in one hand and a 700-page tome about the history of biscuits in the other (or, you know, whatever). That means the likes of shorts, trunks, vests, sandals, and bathing suits, sporting, as EA puts it, a &quot;plethora of patterns, colors and trendy cuts&quot; designed to compliment a variety of skin tones and body shapes.


Finishing touches come in the form of various aquatic accessories, including sunglasses, sandals, rainbow nails, floaties (including at least one rubber ring), and more.

                              <span>Jeff Gardiner, veteran RPG developer, said he&#x27;s &quot;thrilled, not threatened&quot; by the success of other RPGs like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.


Eurogamer spoke to the ex-Bethesda producer at Gamescom and discussed the current state of RPGs: why they&#x27;re so popular and how the success of Larian&#x27;s latest game was raising expectations of the genre.


&quot;I am thrilled, not threatened by great RPGs,&quot; said Gardiner, when asked about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. &quot;I love playing them. I would never be upset by this. I think it brings more people into the fanbase of RPGs. As an RPG creator and player I really believe in RPGs - I always have since I started playing them when I was a kid until now... I will celebrate their success, I&#x27;ll be their biggest fans forever. I am absolutely thrilled by it.&quot;

Every month, the bundle-loving team at Humble selects a collection of PC games for its members to keep. In addition, it provides access to the Humble Games Collection and Vault, and members get 20 percent off the vast collection of games in the Humble Store.


This month, the bundle building team has grouped another eight games together for its subscribers. These are: Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands Chaotic Great Edition, Deceive Inc, The Forgotten City, Aces &amp; Adventures, Foretales, Patch Quest, Autonauts vs PirateBots and Who Pressed Mute on Uncle Marcus.

Admittedly, Kirby&#x27;s Star Stacker is the only game I&#x27;d previously heard of on this list, but Quest for Camelot has piqued my interest (for non-gaming related reasons).

                              <span>Having sex in Starfield will give you an XP boost.


For those looking to increase their XP, it looks like it would be worth setting yourself up for a romantic experience. 


As highlighted on the Starfield reddit (via VG247), players will get a 15 percent XP boost when they sleep with a companion. This little buff is called &quot;Emotional Security&quot;, and lasts for 24 minutes. It is similar but better than the 10 percent well-rested condition, which you can get by sleeping without a companion by your side.

Diablo boss Rod Fergusson confirmed Blizzard&#x27;s plan to launch &quot;quarterly seasons&quot; and &quot;annual expansions&quot; as part of Diablo 4&#x27;s ongoing live service.


Exactly how these expansions will be released, sold and priced is still unclear, however.

                              <span>Stardew Valley creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone has teased fans with a new screenshot for forthcoming game Haunted Chocolatier.


The image, shared on X (formerly Twitter), shows what looks to be the game&#x27;s player character speaking to an old man with a long white beard who is resting in bed.


Sound familiar?

                              <span>James Bond will bring his espionage hijinks to Apple Arcade later this month. 


On 29th September, players will take on the role of a brand-new Bond in Cypher 007. This top-down mobile title comes from Tilting Point, and promises a return to some classic Bond locations, as well as the chance to relive some of the series&#x27; &quot;iconic moments&quot; from the past 60 years. 


This will, of course, mean Her Majesty&#x27;s best agent will also come face to face with several of his known-nemesis, such as Blofeld - along with Spectre - and Jaws. And, as every Bond fan knows, this means gadgets galore, including Little Nellie, Bond&#x27;s gyrocopter from You Only Live Twice.

                              <span>Cross-play is apparently already on the development roadmap for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. This means players on PlayStation 5 and PC - and at some point, Xbox - will all theoretically be able to play together online in the future.
Confirmation comes from Larian&#x27;s director of publishing, Michael Douse, who told me the studio always intended to do cross-play but it was one thing too many to get working for launch. The PS5 version comes out today, remember; the PC version came out at the beginning of August; and the Xbox versions will arrive at some point this year.
&quot;It was always in the planning,&quot; Douse told me, &quot;but we knew it wouldn&#x27;t be for launch. It&#x27;s in the roadmap, and though we have an idea of when we&#x27;d like to get it ready for, we don&#x27;t want to put a date on it until we&#x27;re sure.&quot;

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will not receive any additional content, Nintendo has said.


Nintendo&#x27;s legendary Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma confirmed the decision in an interview with Famitsu, where he said he&#x27;d simply &quot;done everything&quot; he could in Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s world.


Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi agreed, and said that while he was already thinking about what the &quot;next fun experience&quot; for the Zelda series should be, he did not know yet what form this may take.

                              <span>More Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 fixes have spilled forth from the depths of developer Larian Studios&#x27; ceaseless patch factory, this latest update - officially known as Hotfix #5 - remedying some previously acknowledged Minthara progression issues, as well as bringing a number of improvements specifically targeting the newly released PlayStation 5 version.


Starting with Minthara, Hotfix #5 aims to address some behind-the-scenes weirdness that was blocking certain lines of her dialogue, as well preventing player romances with the character from progressing in Act 3. There&#x27;d been some concern in the community, you might recall, that Minthara had been a victim of last-minute content cuts to meet Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s shifted deadline - but Larian had instead blamed her silence on a bug, promising an imminent fix, which, now here, should hopefully reinstate all missing Minthara content.


&quot;This hotfix takes care of a bug that blocked access to some of Minthara’s lines of dialogue, including some hot takes from your companions about your decision to date the ruthless Oath of Vengeance Paladin,&quot; Larian explains in today&#x27;s release notes. &quot;If approval is high enough, your romance with Minthara will progress in Act 3. This unlocks several new dialogues allowing you to explore and deepen the relationship, and discover more details of Minthara&#x27;s backstory. Alongside many lines of interactive dialogue, many more non-interactive voiced lines are available with Minthara as a romantic partner.&quot;

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s September Update will begin rolling out this week, Microsoft has confirmed, giving all users access to a number of features previously only available to Xbox Insiders - including Xbox voice reporting and the ability to stream Xbox One and Series X/S gameplay directly to Discord.


Those interested in gameplay streaming will first need to link their Discord account to their console, after which they can select the &#x27;Discord&#x27; option from &#x27;Parties &amp; chats&#x27; via the guide, pick a server, then directly share gameplay after jumping into a voice channel with friends.


Xbox voice reporting, meanwhile - another feature that made headlines on its Xbox Insiders debut - enables players to easily capture a 60-second video clip of an in-game voice incident they believe violates Xbox Community Standards then submit it as evidence for review.

                              <span>Stray, the much-loved cat adventure from developer BlueTwelve Studio and publisher Annapurna Interactive is being turned into an animated movie by Annapurna&#x27;s own in-house animation studio - the team behind this year&#x27;s Nimona.


Stray, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched last summer for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, depositing players in a dystopian sci-fi metropolis for some exploration, adventure, and a touch of mystery, as its four-legged protagonist searches for a way home.


News of Stray&#x27;s animated adaptation comes via Entertainment Weekly, and while specifics are limited at this seemingly early juncture, there&#x27;s a least a of hint at what Annapurna Animation will be trying to achieve in its own &quot;respectful&quot; adaptation.

                              <span>Following Payday 3&#x27;s  closed beta in August, developer Starbreeze has announced a three-day &quot;technical open beta&quot; for its co-op heist shooter  - running from this Friday, 8th September to Monday&#x27;s 11th September - ahead of this month&#x27;s full launch.


The goal, once again, is to stress test Payday 3&#x27;s servers ready for its 21st September arrival on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, only this time Starbreeze is throwing open the doors to anyone that fancies getting stuck in - as long as they&#x27;re on Xbox Series X/S or Steam.


As for what&#x27;ll be available this time around, it&#x27;s very much the same story as before; the Payday series&#x27; clown-masked original quartet - Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf - will all be playable, as will be the No Rest for the Wicked bank heist, which can be tackled either stealthily or guns a-blazing, depending on your own particular whims.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered why, when you&#x27;re having a lovely stroll around the world of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, there are so many bodies without heads lying around? No it&#x27;s not because the inhabitants of the world have faulty necks - it&#x27;s because developer Larian is doing something sneaky.
You see, offering people the ability to speak with any corpse via the spell Speak with Dead created a lot of work. It meant writers not only had to write lines for all the living people, but for the dead ones too. And okay, there&#x27;s a limiting factor in how Speak with Dead only allows you to ask five questions, but that&#x27;s still an array of questions to write answers for. And in a war-torn world filled with dead people... That&#x27;s a lot of answers to write.
What to do? Simple, albeit gruesome: cut their heads off. &quot;The trick that we use is [you can speak to] &#x27;any dead that still has their head&#x27;,&quot; Vincke told Wizards of the Coast interviewer Todd Kenreck, in a really lovely interview actually. &quot;So you will see a lot of decapitated people in the game - that&#x27;s literally how we solved that.&quot;

                              <span>There are now more Pokémon to collect in Pokémon Go than in any of the franchise&#x27;s main series games.


Today&#x27;s new Pokémon Go in-game event adds a menagerie of creatures from the franchise&#x27;s fictional Paldea region, featured in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, bringing the total number of species available in Pokémon Go up to a whopping 814.


That&#x27;s more than the record number of Pokémon available to use in any main series game, with the most being 809 in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.

                              <span>It turns out you can pinch one of Starfield&#x27;s better suits without picking locks. Not only that, you can actually get it quite near the start of the game.


There are a variety of suits in Starfield, obtained in various ways. Some you can buy from vendors, others can be found by exploration and looting. Your usual video game fare. However, if you are canny and take the time to place your cursor in just the right place, you can nab one of Starfield&#x27;s better suits as early as the second mission. 


The suit in question is the Mark 1 Spacesuit, which comes with the accompanying Helmet and Pack. It is all kept in a glass cabinet, under lock and key, in the basement of The Lodge. You can try to unlock this case in the traditional way, but unless you are a Master lock picker, you will be informed it is too difficult to do this right now.

Patch notes state players should now see a smoother performance when in this mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, over on PC, this Jedi: Survivor patch has introduced support for Nvidia DLSS, which the team said can &quot;massively improve performance&quot; for some users.


The patch also includes the usual bug fixes, such as fixing an issue where players could not retrieve XP if they died under a specific set of circumstances.

Solar Ash is the follow up to Hyper Light Drifter from developer Heart Machine, and turns the surreal dreamscape of that world into a 3D roguelike. It will be available on console, PC and cloud on 14th September.


That&#x27;s just after Starfield, Microsoft and Bethesda&#x27;s big space exclusive. It&#x27;s already available in early access for those who bought the premium edition; for everyone else it will hit Xbox Series X/S, PC and cloud on 6th September.

                              <span>The prominent (and at times controversial) developer Peter Molyneux has shed more light on his past interview appearances, saying he regrets the way he spoke back then.

Molyneux has become known for describing his games in interviews only for the end product to not live up to those words, something which he has repeatedly apologised for in the past, describing his behaviour as over-excitement and lies to stop bored journalists falling asleep. 

In the latest episode of the podcast My Perfect Console with Simon Parkin, Molyenux said the games he described in interviews were the product of a &quot;half-insane, creative mind&quot; designing games on the fly whilst trying to show passion for his work.

Developer Pieces Interactive said it is &quot;gracefully&quot; stepping away from the &quot;chaotic&quot; October release window, to &quot;avoid competing with the wake of Alan&#x27;s epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man&quot;.

The developer continued: &quot;Horror games thrive on the delicate balance of tension, exploiting our vulnerability and the eerie embrace of solitude. Envision yourself traversing a dimly lit house in the dead of night, where faint whispers and unidentifiable noises send shivers down your spine.

                              <span>As Hollow Knight fans still (im)patiently wait for news on sequel Silksong, one talented community member has taken matters into their own hands.


On the game&#x27;s subreddit, Poly Knight shared a video of the Mantis Lords boss fight recreated in full 3D (thanks TheGamer).


It&#x27;s a faithful recreation that proves what the 2D Metroidvania might look like as a 3D adventure.

                              <span>A new version of Minecraft for Xbox Series X/S consoles is on the way.


The currently-unannounced edition has now cropped up via a pair of ratings board listings - first in August via the German USK ratings board, and now in the US via the ESRB.


Neither listing details any new feature headed to these fresh versions of Minecraft, but fans have high hopes that an Xbox Series X/S edition will finally include the game&#x27;s long-awaited ray-tracing option.

FromSoftware&#x27;s latest mech battler is a notoriously tricky game to get to grips with, especially its bosses.


Yet thanks to modder Vawser and their EZ-Core mod on NexusMods, the game is a breeze (spotted by TheGamer).

Last month, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, will no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo&#x27;s most recognisable mascot, after almost 30 years in the job.


Instead, it was announced, Martinet will now take on the role of a Mario Ambassador for the company. Nintendo said this new position will see the actor continuing to &quot;travel the world sharing the joy of Mario and interacting with you all!&quot; Other than that, it did not go into specifics on the job&#x27;s actual requirements.

                              <span>It looks like Sabotage Studio is working on DLC for its retro RPG Sea of Stars.


The company&#x27;s CEO Thierry Boulanger was recently interviewed on Canada Radio, where he explained the company is working on another game with the same development process it adopted for previous game The Messenger (thanks Kakuchopurei, GamesRadar).


Essentially that means the main development team will start work on the next game, while a smaller team will remain to work on DLC for Sea of Stars, just as it did with its ninja platformer.

                              <span>Ratatan, the spiritual successor to Sony Japan Studio&#x27;s beloved PlayStation Portable rhythm adventure Patapon, has wrapped up its Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, successfully amassing well over £1m - substantially above its £100,000 target - along the way.


Ratatan, if you&#x27;re unaware, is a collaboration between Ratata Arts, Tokyo Virtual Theory, and pH Studio, with Patapon creator Hiroyuki Kotani at the helm and original Patapon musician Kemmei Adach also returning. It&#x27;s described as roguelike blend of rhythm and side-scroller action in which players, either battling alone or with friends, build an army of 100 Cobun to take on foes as their march across the world of Redo continues.


Its crowdfunding campaign launched onto Kickstarter on 31st July, with the goal of raising ¥20,000,000 (approximately £109,000), but a little over a month later, it&#x27;s now wrapped up with ¥219,314,335 (around £1.2m) in the bank after contributions from 14,598 backers - apparently making it the  36th most funded video game Kickstarter of all time.

Shedding Light on CVSS Scoring Inconsistencies: A User-Centric Study on Evaluating Widespread Security Vulnerabilities
Abstract: The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a popular method for evaluating the severity of vulnerabilities in vulnerability management. In the evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts, their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the ”2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses” list. In a follow-up survey with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring...</span>

                              <span>The brilliant Arcane looks set to return for its second season on Netflix in winter 2024.


That launch window was revealed on-stage over the weekend at the Video V Vision Conference, held by League of Legends developer Riot Games&#x27; parent company Tencent (thanks, League of Geeks / Kotaku).


Q4 2024 means we&#x27;ll see season two debut sometime between October and December next year. As a reminder, the initial season dropped in November 2021 - making for a three-year gap between episodes.

                              <span>Nintendo has launched Pikmin Finder, a charming but simple mobile browser-based AR game.


Its concept is as you would expect, given the name of the game. You can move around your home, or surrounding area, and find Nintendo&#x27;s unassuming but rather lovely plant-animal hybrid creatures hiding away. 


Once found and plucked with a simple swipe up of the finger, these flower-topped friendlies then proceed to find treasure you never knew you had hidden in your house. It is all rather delightful.

Along with the game&#x27;s thorough character creator, which has already birthed the likes of Walter White from Breaking Bad and Tony Soprano, people have also been flexing their creative muscles on the ship front. 


Starting with perhaps one of the most famous sci-fi properties, here we have a selection of Star Wars-inspired ships. Of course, Han Solo&#x27;s Millennium Falcon has popped up several times since Starfield&#x27;s early access release.

As with most Bethesda games, your journey into the stars begins with creating a custom character.


Many players have had fun creating some familiar faces from TV and film... and also Starfield creator Todd Howard.

                              <span>According to Bethesda, a lot is going to happen between now and 2330, when Starfield is set. Most obviously, if we follow the timeline setout by the developer, humans will be able to gallivant around in space and planet hop as casually as popping across The Channel for a quick visit to France. In fact, possibly even more casually than that. 


But, one thing that also apparently changes between now and 2330, is that dogs seem to go extinct. Or at least, labrador retrievers certainly do.


As shared by the prolific Can You Pet The Dog? social media account, it appears that man&#x27;s best friend is a thing of the past for those members of Constellation.

                              <span>Super Mario Bros. Wonder includes chatty flowers which share jokes and useful hints as you pass by - though Nintendo has now confirmed you can put them on mute if you&#x27;d prefer. 


However, even if you&#x27;d prefer to work the game&#x27;s secrets entirely for yourself, you can&#x27;t get rid of these flowers&#x27; hints completely.


Last week, fans spotted a note on Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese website which stated that you could pick between different options for the flowers&#x27; voice and speech bubbles, raising the possibility you could ignore them completely.

Relationships are a big part of the game&#x27;s appeal, but there&#x27;s no denying that companions come on a little too strong right from the off.


Speaking to TheGamer, game director Swen Vincke admitted that romances were bugged at the game&#x27;s launch and have since been tweaked.

According to Centro Leaks, &quot;the biggest source of Pokémon leaks, rumours, and news&quot;, the two new arrivals will join Munkidori, Okidogi, Fezandipiti, Ogerpon, Dipplin, and Poltchageist when the DLC launches on 13th September.

The Sinistcha &quot;pretends to be tea, trying to fool people into drinking it so it can drain their life-force&quot; – although the ruse is &quot;generally unsuccessful&quot; – and is thought to be from the same line as Poltchageist, as it looks like a Poltchageist, albeit with a different container.

                              <span>Valve has banned 90,000 Dota 2 smurf accounts, and will wipe out their associated main accounts, too, if they continue to spawn smurfs to bypass Valve&#x27;s matchmaking system.

In a candid post, Valve said that any main account found to be associated with a smurf – that is, an alternative account created by an experienced player just to farm XP and/or destroy lower-levelled players – could face &quot;a wide range of publishments&quot;, including permanent bans.

&quot;Today, we permanently banned 90,000 smurf accounts that have been active over the last few months,&quot; the team explained (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;Smurf accounts are alternate accounts used by players to avoid playing at the correct MMR, to abandon games, to cheat, to grief, or to otherwise be toxic without consequence.

u/Tidyckilla took to Starfield&#x27;s subreddit over the weekend to report their amazing escape, saying that if they hadn&#x27;t been awake &quot;bingeing&quot; the game when the fire broke out, the player and their wife would likely have &quot;died to smoke inhalation&quot;.

&quot;Starfield literally saved mine and my family’s life on 1st September,&quot; the player explained, appending a photograph of an apartment fire to his post.

Interestingly, the listing also reveals a little more about Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s microtransactions, too.

&quot;We are aware that many of you have been asking for a PC version&quot;, Yoshida said in a televised statement. &quot;So allow me to take this opportunity to officially announce that development on a PC version is currently underway.

Talking to Entertainment Weekly, Druckmann talked about how his &quot;job is really strange&quot; – &quot;I&#x27;m given feedback on this theme park thing, I&#x27;m working on the TV show, and I&#x27;m working on another game, so I&#x27;m just kind of jumping around on different projects&quot; – and, after confirming that the second season of HBO&#x27;s blockbuster The Last of Us series is &quot;outlined and ready to go as soon as the strike ends&quot;, was then asked about the highly-anticipated third The Last of Us game.

&quot;As far as the next game at Naughty Dog, I can&#x27;t say anything,&quot; he said. &quot;My comms director over there will slaughter me.&quot;

                              <span>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 will release in late 2024 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.

The game – which tells &quot;a vampire story set in modern Seattle reimagined for World of Darkness&quot; – is in development with celebrated indie studio, The Chinese Room.

As it&#x27;s still early days, we don&#x27;t yet have a gameplay trailer – although the teaser above gives us a flavour of what&#x27;s to come – but The Chinese Room says it&#x27;ll have gameplay to reveal in January 2024, and the game is expected to release in the fall/autumn that same year (that&#x27;s Q3 for our friends in the southern hemisphere).

The news came from Elianora themselves, who confirmed that they feigned surprise at each new teaser and press release because they&#x27;re secretly been working on the game at Bethesda all this time.

&quot;I have been deceiving you. I have been lying. I have been faking. I&#x27;ve kept secrets and pretended, &quot;Elianora teased in a recent Facebook update.

                              <span>Good news, Diablo fans – Diablo 4 is running a bonus XP/Gold event, Mother&#x27;s Blessing, to celebrate the (US - not for us in the UK, sadly) holiday weekend.

As Diablo&#x27;s official Xitter account puts it, &quot;only a fool refuses her bounty&quot;, which is a not-so-subtle hint to get stuck in and earn 25 per cent more XP and gold from now until 5th September. 

&quot;Rise, wanderer, and stand triumphant before your hoard of spoils,&quot; Blizzard says. &quot;An alluring glow descends across the land, increasing the clarity and temperament of all stalwart warriors. Scholars have unlocked new secrets in their ancient tomes, while coffers threaten to burst with gold unearthed from long-forgotten crypts.

                              <span>Horror master Supermassive Games has revealed that the reason Little Nightmares 3 only features online co-op is to ensure playing with a friend doesn&#x27;t detract from the horror game&#x27;s signature &quot;atmosphere and immersion&quot;.  

Whilst co-op was &quot;the most requested feature from fans&quot; and something the team was keen to implement, Supermassive said that it needed to balance the fun of sharing the spooky happenings with ensuring playing with a pal didn&#x27;t ameliorate the tension.

&quot;Co-op was the most requested feature from our fans, so it was really important for us to give them that,&quot; Bandai Namco producer Coralie Feniello told GamesRadar. &quot;I do think that it will add a layer to the game as well, by letting you experience it with a friend.

                              <span>The media artists union SAG-AFTRA has voted to expand its ongoing Hollywood strike to encompass the games industry.

In a statement posted to its official website, the union confirmed its board had &quot;voted unanimously&quot; to &quot;send a strike authorisation vote to SAG-AFTRA members&quot; in interactive media ahead of its &quot;forthcoming bargaining dates with video game companies&quot;. 

Key issues up for negotiation include pay and conditions, but also &quot;protections against unrestrained use of artificial intelligence&quot;, specifically the impact upon performance capture artists.

Six months ago, Alex Hay posted on the Starfield subreddit to share his dismay that despite &quot;following this project for years&quot;, he probably wouldn&#x27;t live long enough to play Starfield following a lung cancer diagnosis at just 36 years of age. 

Just a few weeks later, the thread was updated to confirm that Alex - who himself was an app developer - had indeed sadly died, but revealed that Hay had been a huge Bethesda fan and took great comfort playing games whilst under palliative care, calling his Xbox &quot;a great form of escapism&quot;.

In a tweet posted to the studio&#x27;s Japanese language player support X/Twitter account, the team confirmed the issue was affecting players who put their PCs to sleep whilst the game was still running. Consequently, it&#x27;s now urging players to save and properly shut down Armored Core 6 before their PCs slip into sleep mode.

&quot;In the PC version of &#x27;Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon&#x27;, there is a problem that save data is not saved properly under certain circumstances,&quot; the developer explained, as translated by Google Translate.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s medieval grand strategy game Crusader Kings 3 is celebrating its three-year anniversary by trumpeting 3m copies sold since launch and by releasing a bunch of statistics gleaned in that time, suggesting players&#x27; conflict resolution skills may need some work - or at least, a little less of a preoccupation with murder.


According to Paradox, a grand total of 50,159,539 murder schemes have been successfully carried out since Crusader Kings 3&#x27;s arrival back in 2020. That&#x27;s nearly 16m more murder plots than wedding celebrations, which currently sit at 34,480,042. And, of course, more than a few chaotic sorts have thoroughly muddied the waters between the two, with Paradox reporting a total of 7,790 bloody weddings have been msaterminded by players who cleary weren&#x27;t going to let a bit of murder get in the way of anyone&#x27;s big day - or possiby vice versa.


Paradox&#x27;s other shared stats don&#x27;t open up quite such a fascinating window on player behaviour, but we do know 1,325,198 grand tournaments have been bravely fought since launch, and 1,037,787 grand weddings have also been held. In total, player have amassed more than 317m hours in-game, with nearly 1.4m players having joined this year alone.

Doinksoft&#x27;s &quot;gritty noir-punk action-adventure&quot; follows the adventures of a gruff woodsman armed with the high-calibre brolly of the title as he embarks on a request for revenge. Soon, because this is very much one of those games, players become embroiled in a conspiracy involving ghouls, gangsters, cops, cultists, and, of course, a corporation run amok.


In more practical terms, that manifests as a side-scrolling action-platformer in which players take on the might of their foes using a brolly that&#x27;s simultaneously a gun - enhanceable with munitions and upgrades fashioned from gathered scrap - plus a handy all-in-one shield.

                              <span>Following the release of last week&#x27;s splendid Echoes update, No Man&#x27;s Sky has now launched its latest limited-time expedition, Voyagers, giving players approximately six weeks to complete its objectives and secure some very nifty rewards - including an adorable HoverDroid companion, looking very much like a flying Roomba with eyes.


Voyagers - which, like all previous expeditions, starts players afresh on a completely new save - begins aboard a freighter in No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Oishida system, where Travelers will embark on a journey to complete exploration-focused objectives, discovering new creatures, braving extreme planets, digging up ancient treasures, and more along the way.


If you&#x27;re new to all this, expeditions are something like No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s stab at live-service-style seasonal content, serving up limited-time, curated experiences that condense and reshuffle the exploratory space sim&#x27;s various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges. Completing all objectives within a tier unlocks a new reward exclusive to the expedition and completing all tiers awards one final prize.

                              <span>You know when you want to do a spot of time travelling, but you get to your DeLorean and it is just caked top to bottom in all sorts of gunk and grime? No, you don&#x27;t? Well, PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab certainly does.


Today, the jet-loving team announced the Back to the Future collaboration for its beloved clean-it-up game (which is a bit of a Eurogamer favourite). FuturLab has said this DLC pack, which will retail at £6.49/$7.99/€7.99, will be a faithful homage to Marty and Doc&#x27;s time travelling escapades. 


So, what can you expect to clean on this DLC&#x27;s release? Well, of course, you will have to get your watery-jets into every nook and cranny of the series&#x27; Time Machine. It really wouldn&#x27;t be a Back to the Future collaboration without it. Additionally, Doc&#x27;s van, Hill Valley Clock Tower, the Holomax Theatre and Doc&#x27;s Time Train will all need to be sprayed to perfection.

                              <span>They say that visiting Ikea and building flatpack furniture is one of the greatest tests of any relationship.


Now that experience has been adapted into video game form.


The aptly named KallaX, developed by French indie studio Unexpected, is a new co-op game that sees 2 - 6 players building furniture together - in space, no less.

Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland is a classic mascot platformer based on the 90s Nickelodeon TV series coming to PC, consoles, and the NES.


The game is presented in retro 8-bit graphics, though modern versions will also include a HD graphics option to toggle on a smooth hand-drawn look.

While Bethesda may yet provide an official option in future, there&#x27;s no way currently to alter Starfield&#x27;s FOV for yourself within the game. 


But, already, there are a number of downloads available on NexusMods for players to tinker with the FOV, via a new text file added to the game&#x27;s folder on your PC.

The game released overnight for those who purchase its pricey £85.99 premium edition, which allows access ahead of the release on 6th September.


Already, Starfield has reached a peak of 234,502 concurrent players, according to SteamDB. At the time of writing it&#x27;s the sixth most played game on the platform, behind only heavy hitters like CS:GO, Dota 2, and Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.

                              <span>Last year, Bethesda described Starfield as having a &quot;NASA-Punk&quot; aesthetic. This term was coined by the development team to describe &quot;a sci-fi universe that&#x27;s a little more grounded and relatable&quot;. Essentially, Bethesda wants its game to have a sense of realism meets grit, and it is doing this by combining the practicality of real-life space technology with the aesthetics of Punk culture. 


Now, this design decision has got the European Space Agency&#x27;s approval, with its head of branding and partnerships Emmet Fletcher telling me he believes Starfield&#x27;s NASA-Punk aesthetic &quot;humanises&quot; the game.


&quot;This is the aesthetic where you basically have worn and loved futuretech? Actually, if you look at some of the things we have, it&#x27;s a little bit like that already,&quot; he told me from his office in Paris earlier this week. &quot;We have things that if it works, it carries on working. And there&#x27;s no need to change it. It&#x27;s about reliability, and if it&#x27;s reliable, it carries on.&quot;

                              <span>Gearbox&#x27;s Borderlands series is readying for a busy few months; a six-game digital-only Borderlands bundle is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC tomorrow, 1st September, and Borderlands 3 will be making its Switch debut on 6th October.


Starting with the Borderlands Collection: Pandora&#x27;s Box, as the bundle is officially known, it packages up every game in the series so far, excluding last year&#x27;s Tina Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands spin-off - so, Borderlands 1, 2, The Pre-Sequel, 3, Tales from the Borderlands, and New Tales from the Borderlands - and then crams in every bit of accompanying DLC.


It&#x27;s a significant amount of Borderlands, then, and the bundle comes with a correspondingly sizeable price tag, weighing in at $149.99 USD (or your local equivalent). The happier news, though, is that publisher 2K is offering a range of discounts, starting with a far more affordable $59.99 limited-time launch price. Additionally, 2K has announced a number of upgrade paths for existing Borderlands players, making the cost of entry more manageable still.

                              <span>Volition Games, the studio best known for its work on the Saints Row series, has been closed down &quot;effective immediately&quot; as part of parent company Embracer Group&#x27;s previously announced &quot;restructuring&quot; programme.


Volition, which celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this year, announced the closure in a statement shared on social media, writing, &quot;This past June, Embracer Group announced a restructuring programme to strengthen and maintain its position as a leader in the video game industry. As part of that programme, they evaluated strategic and operational goals and made the difficult decision to close Volition effective immediately.&quot;


The statement adds that Embracer is &quot;working to provide job assistance and help smooth the transition for our Volition family members&quot;. The move is likely to effect around 340 people based on the studio&#x27;s most recently shared employment figures.

                              <span>A Brazilian spyware app vendor was hacked by activists:
In an undated note seen by TechCrunch, the unnamed hackers described how they found and exploited several security vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise WebDetetive’s servers and access its user databases. By exploiting other flaws in the spyware maker’s web dashboard—used by abusers to access the stolen phone data of their victims—the hackers said they enumerated and downloaded every dashboard record, including every customer’s email address.
The hackers said that dashboard access also allowed them to delete victim devices from the spyware network altogether, effectively severing the connection at the server level to prevent the device from uploading new data. “Which we definitely did. Because we could. Because #fuckstalkerware,” the hackers wrote in the note...</span>

On August 15, 2023, the Kubernetes project announced the general availability of
the community-owned package repositories for Debian and RPM packages available
at pkgs.k8s.io. The new package repositories are replacement for the legacy
Google-hosted package repositories: apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io.
The
announcement blog post for pkgs.k8s.io
highlighted that we will stop publishing packages to the legacy repositories in
the future.
Today, we&#x27;re formally deprecating the legacy package repositories (apt.kubernetes.io
and yum.kubernetes.io), and we&#x27;re announcing our plans to freeze the contents of
the repositories as of September 13, 2023.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re back from Gamescom and scurrying around trying to let you know everything we saw. We chatted to Phil Spencer, we saw Starfield, we played Sonic and much more. But what else caught our eye?

We sat down this week to chat about what we saw and ended up honing in on some of our personal favourites - games which may not have caught the headlines as much as that big new RPG everyone&#x27;s going on about. Games which appealed specifically to us - because they felt authentically British - like the wonderfully Yorkshire Thank Goodness You&#x27;re Here and the North Sea oil rig horror Still Wakes the Deep. 
I adored The Plucky Squire. Ed loved Black Myth: Wukong. Together with Victoria Kennedy, who held the news fort brilliantly back home in Blighty, we chat about the best of what we saw last week in Cologne.

                              <span>Fellow puzzlers, there is good news. Not only has the second expansion for The Case of the Golden Idol been announced, but it is actually available now. 


Known as The Lemurian Vampire, this expansion connects the game&#x27;s previous expansion Spider of Lanka directly to the main game. &quot;The only thing that stands in your way, is the mysterious Tower Dweller and its powerful Golden artefact,&quot; developer Color Gray Games teased. 


The Lemurian Vampire consists of three new scenarios to mull over, as you &quot;follow the perilous journey of the Lemurian delegation to Monkey Paw Island&quot;. These delegates are on the search for the fountain of youth (aren&#x27;t we all?), and of course any riches that may be hidden along the way.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed its latest Switch OLED model - the Mario Red edition.


This new console edition is, as you can see in the header image above, very red. It features a little Mario silhouette tucked away on the back corner of the base, as well as some hidden coins inside its back panel.


This new Switch OLED will be available to scoop up from 6th October. While Nintendo hasn&#x27;t shared specifics yet, it has said to keep an eye out for more information on pre-orders, and presumably a price, &quot;soon&quot;.

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s Prime Gaming offers several free titles throughout the month of September, including Football Manager 2023 and the winemaking sim Hundred Days.


In our Football Manager 2023 review on PC, we described it as &quot;the best sim of its kind&quot;, however contributor Phil Iwaniuk felt the &quot;lack of major improvements shows an annual release schedule taking its toll&quot;.


As for Hundred Days, our Bertie spoke to Yves Hohler, lead designer of the game, back in 2021, to learn more about how his experiences shaped the winemaking sim. It&#x27;s a cute and cosy game that never feels bogged down by the management aspect, instead presenting a whimsical love letter to Hohler&#x27;s earlier life.

                              <span>Wahoo! Super Mario Bros. Wonder is getting a dedicated Nintendo Direct today, 31st August, at 3pm UK time. 


Tune in for 15 minutes of new details and gameplay from Nintendo&#x27;s brilliantly bizarre-looking Mario sidescroller, which is due to launch for Nintendo Switch in October. 


So far we&#x27;ve seen that Super Mario Bros. Wonder will let Mario turn into an elephant - but what else does Nintendo have stuffed down its weird, wriggling warp pipes? And can you identify the new voice playing Mario, following the departure of Charles Martinet? Tune in right here to find out.

Ubisoft has yet to announce this new re-release, or detail what it might contain. Eurogamer has contacted the publisher for comment.

                              <span>Just when you thought you knew everything about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - all the top tips and tricks - a fresh handful of them come along and take you by surprise. Well, they take me by surprise - I bet you&#x27;re much more savvy than me. Just in case you aren&#x27;t, though, and you&#x27;re a kindred spirit, here&#x27;s what I stumbled upon.
The tip that really took me by surprise is this. Did you know that you can initiate combat during an interaction cut-scene to affect the outcome of it? It means you can potentially save a character scripted to be attacked - and maybe killed - during the cut-scene before it actually happens. 
The tip comes from content creator ESO Danny. As the video points out, you can interrupt a cut-scene by selecting the &quot;Attack&quot; circular button/option in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has said its decision to only develop one expansion for its ambitious sci-fi role-player was based solely on &quot;technological&quot; factors. 


The drama around Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s initial launch and subsequent withdrawal from sale on PlayStation, as well as the game&#x27;s overall sales figures, all had nothing to do with it, the developer has stated. 


&quot;As we have announced a long time ago, we&#x27;re not going to make a second or third expansion,&quot; CD Projekt exec Michał Nowakowski said in an investor Q&amp;A held last night (thanks, VGC). &quot;This is the only expansion of the game, and it has nothing to do with the numbers and how satisfied or not we are with sales or anything of the kind.&quot;

Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - which is due to launch for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 on 7th November - sees Life is Strange and Vampyr developer Don&#x27;t Nod heading to the frozen wilderness of North America, circa 1695, for a tale of ghost-hunting lovers, one of whom is (rather awkwardly given their profession) recently undead.


It&#x27;s the pleasingly spooky set-up for an action-RPG that promises a &quot;mystical, lore-rich world plagued with supernatural creatures and ancient secrets&quot;, and Banishers&#x27; extended gameplay trailer follows our heroes Red and the spirit-y Antea as they investigate a haunting at the behest of a New Eden villager - an investigation that leaps between the physical and spectral worlds, and somehow manages to involve quite a lot of gun.

                              <span>Activision has announced new measures to combat toxicity within Call of Duty, confirming it&#x27;ll be introducing what it calls &quot;global real-time voice chat moderation&quot; alongside the launch of Modern Warfare 3 on 10th November, with a US beta trial of the feature starting today.


Call of Duty&#x27;s new voice chat moderation system will employ AI-powered technology from Modulate to identify and enforce against toxic speech in real-time, with flagged language including hate speech, discrimination, and harassment.


An initial beta for Call of Duty&#x27;s new voice moderation system is being rolled out across Warzone and Modern Warfare 2 starting today, 30th August, in North America, and a global release will coincide with Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s arrival in November. Activision notes the tools will only support English at first, with additional languages coming &quot;at a later date&quot;.

                              <span>Pokémon Go is slinging open the gates to Paldea with its first batch of additions from last year&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which join the game from next week.


Pokémon Go&#x27;s initial Paldea line-up arrives across two consecutive updates as part of its latest season, beginning on Tuesday, 5th September. Sprigatito, Floragato, Meowscarada, Fuecoco, Crocalor, Skeledirge, Quaxly, Quaxwell, Quaquaval, Lechonk, and Oinkologne (both male and female variants) are all up first, with Lechonk even getting a Shiny variant at launch.


This starting batch debuts in Pokémon Go&#x27;s A Paldean Adventure event, which runs from 5th September until Sunday, 10th September. Other additions include Lechonk-focused Timed Research, Unown in global raids, and various event bonuses, as detailed in Niantic&#x27;s post.

So how was this van turned into a mobile spying center? Well, let’s start with how it has more LCD monitors than a Counterstrike LAN party. They can be used to monitor any of six different video inputs including a videoscope camera. A videoscope and a borescope are very similar as they’re both cameras on the ends of optical fibers, so the same tech you’d use to inspect cylinder walls is also useful for surveillance. Kind of cool, right?

                              <span>A fresh trailer for Bō: Path of The Teal Lotus has revealed more of its combat and abilities, all of which stem from Japanese folklore.


The game will be published by Humble Games and is being developed by Squid Shock Studios, comprising members of the AM2R team - an unofficial fan remake of Metroid 2.


Bō: Path of The Teal Lotus is, understandably, a Metroidvania, but with a beautiful Japanese art style reminiscent of Okami. Check out the new trailer below.

                              <span>Konami has delayed its remasters of Suikoden 1 and 2, originally set for release in 2023.


It&#x27;s unclear when the remasters will now launch, though a statement from Konami simply reads &quot;as soon as is possible&quot;.


&quot;Regarding the planned release of Suikoden 1 and 2 HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, we have reached the conclusion that despite the very best efforts of our dedicated development staff to release the Remasters in 2023, additional time is needed to ensure the quality performance and gameplay experience our users deserve,&quot; reads the statement.

                              <span>Retro-style RPG Sea of Stars has sold 100k copies in just one day.


It&#x27;s an impressive number for the indie game from The Messenger developer Sabotage Studio. It&#x27;s doubly impressive when the game was released simultaneously on both Game Pass and PlayStation Plus - the first game to do so. 


The sales announcement, made on X (formerly Twitter), specifies copies sold rather than the game&#x27;s overall players, meaning that 100k number reflects Steam and Switch sales.

                              <span>Head of Sonic Team Takashi Iizuka doesn&#x27;t think pixel art is a &quot;viable art style&quot; for the future of Sonic, so don&#x27;t get your hopes up for Sonic Mania 2.


In an interview with Games Radar at Gamescom, Iizuka discussed the future of the Sonic franchise and the need to maintain both 2D and 3D Sonic games in parallel.


&quot;When we talk about the brand, we definitely need to have a modern Sonic 3D game,&quot; he said. &quot;We also feel we need to have a classic Sonic 2D game. Those are our fundamental pillars that we need to have. We&#x27;re expanding into movies and TV, but we still need to have both the 3D and the 2D line up for our gaming audience.&quot;

                              <span>A week after Baldur&#x27;s Gate got its first major patch - bringing around 1,000 bug fixes among other things - developer Larian Studios has shared initial details on its next big batch of changes, fixes, and additions, which it says is &quot;just around the corner&quot;.


Patch 2&#x27;s headline features include Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s first &quot;substantial performance improvements&quot; and better closure to its story. Starting with performance, Larian is promising improvements across the entire game, but says &quot;Act 3 [is] where you&#x27;ll feel it the most&quot;.


Specifically, Patch 2 will target the city of Baldur&#x27;s Gate itself, which Digital Foundry&#x27;s recently highlighted as a serious rough spot in an otherwise impressive game. Larian, for its part, calls the area &quot;ambitious technically, narratively, and in scope&quot;, saying, &quot;One of the biggest issues with creating games is that technology is always trying to keep up with your ambition, and here we&#x27;ve been hit pretty hard by some setbacks.&quot;

                              <span>Pioneers of Pagonia, the intriguing new city builder from original The Settlers designer Volker Wertich and his team at Envision Entertainment, is launching into Steam early access on 13th December, with a public demo and closed alpha planned before then.


Pioneers of Pagonia, for the uninitiated, whisks players away to the procedurally generated islands of Pagonia, where they&#x27;ll need to establish a presence - steadily increasingly their reach and influence among the islands&#x27; many fantastical, not always friendly inhabitants - through production, economic expansion, and exploration, making use of the resources they uncover along the way.


We got a first taste of Pioneers of Pagonia&#x27;s city building action back in June - via an extremely adorable in-game reveal trailer - and Envision has been sharing occassional gameplay details in posts on Steam too. Soon, though, it&#x27;ll be time for players to get stuck in, starting with a closed alpha in September - which will be available to selected subscribers of the studio&#x27;s newsletter.

                              <span>Jupiter Corporation - the studio behind Nintendo&#x27;s long-running Picross series - has unveiled a new Picross-style puzzler, Logiart Grimoire, which launches into Steam early access on 11th September and Switch sometime next year.


The Logiart Grimoire of the title is a magical book formerly used to solve Logiart mysteries before its power waned, and it comes into players&#x27; possession along with its custodian, a helpful wizard-y companion called Emil. That whole fanciful framing device is, of course, secondary to the real business at hand: solving &#x27;picture logic puzzles&#x27; that feature horizontal and vertical rows of numbers used as hints to place dots on a grid and form illustrations.


If that sounds familiar, it&#x27;s because Logiart Grimoire is essentially Picross in all but name (Nintendo owns the &#x27;Picross&#x27; title, while Jupiter owns its systems), albeit with an added magic twist hooking into a new &quot;fusion&quot; system that challenges players to figure out how to combine materials gained through solving puzzles to unlock new ones.

                              <span>Interesting story of an Apple Macintosh app that went rogue. Basically, it was a good app until one particular update…when it went bad.
With more official macOS features added in 2021 that enabled the “Night Shift” dark mode, the NightOwl app was left forlorn and forgotten on many older Macs. Few of those supposed tens of thousands of users likely noticed when the app they ran in the background of their older Macs was bought by another company, nor when earlier this year that company silently updated the dark mode app so that it hijacked their machines in order to send their IP data through a server network of affected computers, AKA a botnet...</span>

We are thrilled to announce the v0.8.0 release of Gateway API! With this
release, Gateway API support for service mesh has reached Experimental
status. We look forward to your feedback!
We&#x27;re especially delighted to announce that Kuma 2.3+, Linkerd 2.14+, and Istio
1.16+ are all fully-conformant implementations of Gateway API service mesh
support.
Service mesh support in Gateway API
While the initial focus of Gateway API was always ingress (north-south)
traffic, it was clear almost from the beginning that the same basic routing
concepts should also be applicable to service mesh (east-west) traffic. In
2022, the Gateway API subproject started the G…</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been quite so enamoured by a menu screen. Spinning wheels and pressing buttons to make selections. Picking up figurines with my hands to inspect them closely. Looking down at the dusty library below me from my cosy attic - a library Moss fans will certainly be familiar with.


That&#x27;s the power of virtual reality, something developer Polyarc is particularly adept at harnessing. Moss and its sequel remain two of the best adventures playable in VR; now there&#x27;s Glassbreakers, a game set in the same world but with totally different gameplay.


Polyarc describes the game as a live service 1v1 real-time battler. In practice, it&#x27;s you against another player online aiming to take control of a hex board using three champions who auto-battle in real time. You strategically manoeuvre your characters across the board to destroy your opponent&#x27;s tower. It looks a bit like holochess in Star Wars, but with woodland creatures instead of aliens.

                              <span>German developer Mimimi Games has announced the studio&#x27;s closure, which will gradually happen over the coming months.

The announcement comes shortly after the release of real-time strategy stealth game Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew two weeks ago. Other games under Mimimi&#x27;s belt include Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun and Desperados 3.

The statement regarding the studio&#x27;s closure, attributed to co-founders Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth, was posted on Mimimi&#x27;s website which, at time of writing, returns a 403 error but can be viewed as a cached version via Google.

                              <span>Nintendo will broadcast a special Nintendo Direct presentation this week focusing entirely on Super Mario Bros. Wonder, its upcoming trippy side-scroller.


Tune in this Thursday, 31st August at 3pm UK time for roughly 15 minutes of action from the game, broadcast via YouTube - or hosted right here on Eurogamer. 


Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the first all-new side-scrolling Mario game from Nintendo for a decade, and it looks to shake up the series&#x27; formula. Oh, and yes, Mario can turn into an elephant.

                              <span>Activision has given us our best look yet at Tomb Raider&#x27;s Lara Croft in Call of Duty.


The design has taken most of its inspiration from the &#x27;Classic Lara&#x27; look of old, with her dual pistols, tank top and braid all taking pride of place in the promotional shots released so far (see header above, and image below). 
This version of Lara also wears the necklace from the Tomb Raider reboot games, perhaps giving us a look at how Lara might appear in the series&#x27; future, unified timeline. She certainly looks older than the &#x27;Survivor&#x27; timeline Lara, who we last saw in 2018&#x27;s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

Although a core appeal of the game&#x27;s mechas are the fun guns and lasers you can outfit your robot with, you can still have a great time without them.
This is what YouTuber ZeroLenny set out to prove by beating Armored Core 6 without any weapons - no guns, no rockets, just pure force and punches.

                              <span>The developer behind upcoming zombie MMO The Day Before has filed a new trademark for something known as Dayworld, suggesting a name change is in the pipeline.


This new trademark, spotted by WellPlayed, covers a range of categories, including &quot;downloadable game software; computer game software downloadable from a global computer network; downloadable computer game software for use on mobile devices&quot;,  and more.  


As a quick reminder, The Day Before was originally meant to release on PC back in March. However, in a bizarre series of events, it transpired that developer Fntastic had failed to trademark the game&#x27;s name, which had subsequently been contested by a company behind a calendar app.

                              <span>Armored Core 6 features the Moonlight Greatsword from Dark Souls, which makes it a Soulslike.


I jest of course. The Armored Core series is very much its own thing. But the inclusion of this iconic weapon is a fun Easter egg present through most FromSoftware games.


The weapon first appeared in the studio&#x27;s 1994 game King&#x27;s Field as the Moonlight Sword and has since appeared in most of its games in various guises, from Dark Souls to Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and past Armored Core games.

The option has been removed from Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass sign-up website (thanks, XGP). Now, you must simply pay the full amount for your first month.


Microsoft recently slashed the offer from a full month at £1/$1 to just 14 days, back at the start of August. Eurogamer asked Microsoft for comment on the change at the time, but did not receive any further information.

…the saboteurs appear to have sent simple so-called “radio-stop” commands via radio frequency to the trains they targeted. Because the trains use a radio system that lacks encryption or authentication for those commands, Olejnik says, anyone with as little as $30 of off-the-shelf radio equipment can broadcast the command to a Polish train­—sending a series of three acoustic tones at a 150.100 megahertz frequency­—and trigger their emergency stop function...</span>

This blog describes the mixed version proxy, a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.28. The
mixed version proxy enables an HTTP request for a resource to be served by the correct API server
in cases where there are multiple API servers at varied versions in a cluster. For example,
this is useful during a cluster upgrade, or when you&#x27;re rolling out the runtime configuration of
the cluster&#x27;s control plane.
What problem does this solve?
When a cluster undergoes an upgrade, the kube-apiservers existing at different versions in that scenario can serve different sets (groups, versions, resources) of built-in resources. A resource request made in this scenario may be served by any of the available apiservers, potentially resulting in the request ending up at an apiserve…</span>

That&#x27;s according to performance director Aliona Baranova, who posted a lengthy thread to Xitter over the weekend to detail exactly how much work goes into making your favourite games feel &quot;so alive&quot;.

&quot;[For a]lmost ALL the dialogue we recorded, we ALSO captured the actors mocap data,&quot; Baranova explained. &quot;That means all 248 actors, ALL the NPCs and not just the companions put on a mocap suit and their movements, gestures, and physical choices were recorded and sent along with the audio files for the animators to use in game. which is why the performances feels so alive.&quot;

                              <span>Destiny 2 players are pre-ordering the game&#x27;s next expansion and annual pass, The Final Shape, and cancelling it again when a code for an in-game Exotic fusion rifle comes through.

Destiny 2 content creator Luckyy10P took to Xitter over the weekend to ask if rumours about players being able to keep their pre-order goodies was true… and plenty of players responded to confirm that it was. 

&quot;I do not encourage doing this,&quot; Luckyy was quick to add. &quot;but I was curious if this is in fact happening.&quot;

                              <span>Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has called the balance between delivering the violence fans want and the need to sanitise games in order to stream them a &quot;dilemma&quot;.

Talking to IGN, Boon reflected on the importance of enabling influencers and content creators to monetise their Mortal Kombat 1-flavoured content, but acknowledged that if there was a mode that &quot;turned off all the blood or something&quot;, it would &quot;strip away an entire layer&quot; of Mortal Kombat&#x27;s very identity.

&quot;Let&#x27;s say we had a mode that turned off all the blood or something or didn&#x27;t have fatalities or something like that,&quot; Boon said when asked if the NetherRealm team had ever considered a &quot;streamer safe&quot; mode.

                              <span>The Chinese Room has dropped a fascinating short documentary about how it is constructing the worldbuilding in its upcoming 70s horror, Still Wakes the Deep.

Lead environment artist Iain Gillespie, associate art director Laura Dodds, and lead designer Rob McLachlan discuss &quot;how the environment will evolve over time as well as the key inspirations behind the game&#x27;s horror&quot;.

&quot;The period, the geographical location of the rig – these all play a crucial role in this narrative-driven horror story,&quot; explains publisher Secret Mode. &quot;Fans will discover how the team developed a fascination for cranes and scoured British Petroleum&#x27;s documentary archives when striving for an authentic representation of a Scottish oil rig in the 1970s.&quot;

                              <span>Cast your mind back to the halcyon days of July 2022 (PowerWash Simulator came out, it was fab) and you might recall developer Digital Extremes unveiling its first new property since Warframe&#x27;s release back in 2013: a free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG going by the name Soulframe. One and a bit years later, and the studio is finally ready to give it a proper showing, airing 30 minutes of gameplay during its TennoCon 2023 fan convention this weekend.


Soulframe&#x27;s development is being lead by former Warframe creative director Geoff Crookes (Rebecca Ford has taken over the role on Warframe, driving the sci-fi shooter in a wonderfully bonkers new direction over the last few years) and takes players to a world that, as was explained during its initial reveal, is &quot;a little angry about what&#x27;s been done to it&quot;. This causes the earth to shift throughout the day, giving Digital Extremes the lore excuse it needs to introduce some of its beloved procedural dungeons, here found deep underground.


These dungeons do eventually put in an appearance during Soulframe&#x27;s 30-minute gameplay reveal, but first we get a more thorough glimpse of how Soulframe&#x27;s action plays out. The title has been described as a &quot;mirror universe&quot; to Warframe, meaning that while some element will be familiar to fans of the free-to-play sci-fi shooter - those procedural dungeons, for instance - a lot is very different, with slow-paced melee combat in a fantasy setting being the vibe here.

                              <span>As part of its big TennoCon 2023 fan convention news blowout, developer Digital Extremes has pulled back the veil on Warframe&#x27;s next big expansion, Whisper in the Walls, as well as detailing the free-to-play sci-fi shooter&#x27;s mid-term future as its celebrates the big one-oh - including perhaps its wildest expansion yet in next year&#x27;s Warframe: 1999.


Whisper in the Walls, though - which was revealed with the huge 20-minute chunk of gameplay you can see below - is certainly no slouch on the wild front, continuing Warframe&#x27;s wonderfully weird streak by folding in mysterious multi-storey men, instantaneous dimensional shifts, and even brief glimpses of extremely out-of-place retro Earth tech - 80s mobile phones and beige PCs with CRTs to name a few - in its arresting unveiling.


As explained by Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford in a press event prior to TennoCon, Whisper in the Walls - which introduces new missions types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, alongside a new hub and procedural tile set - is all about going back to the familiar and re-contextualising everything players have seen so far in their ten-year Warframe journey.

                              <span>As part of its recently publicised cutbacks, BioWare has &quot;let go of&quot; Lukas Kristjanson, the lead writer behind Baldur&#x27;s Gate 1 and 2, and the writer of the first three Dragon Age games, Mary Kirby.

BioWare announced earlier this week that it&#x27;ll be laying off approximately 50 employees - around 20 per cent of its total workforce, according to recent employment figures - as part of a &quot;shift towards a more agile and more focused studio&quot;. Each writer had been with the studio for over 20 years. 

Kristjanson is widely credited for not just bringing us the original Baldur&#x27;s Gate games, but also credited as the writer behind some of gaming&#x27;s most iconic characters, including Minsc and Mass Effect&#x27;s Joker.

                              <span>Bad news, RoboCop fans – Rogue City has once again been delayed, this time slipping to 2nd November 2023 (and not November 2024, as detailed on some of the game&#x27;s promotional materials).

RoboCop: Rogue City was initially announced back in 2021 and has been delayed several times since. To soften the blow of the delay, however, publisher Nacon has treated us to a new gameplay trailer, which you can check out it all its bullet-y glory below:

It&#x27;s only a minute and a half long, but the teaser gives us a balanced look at both the cinematics, storyline, and gameplay, including the frenzied FPS action and some of the game&#x27;s more puzzle-like segments.

                              <span>Sega has confirmed plans to host a &quot;special broadcast&quot; with Atlus at next month&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show.

The &quot;Sega New&quot; broadcast – set for 11am UK time on 21st September (that&#x27;s 7pm Japan time, and 3am PT) – will be broadcast via Sega&#x27;s Japanese and English websites and YouTube channels, informing players &quot;all about the newest titles from Sega and Atlus&quot;.

If you&#x27;re hoping for more details, I&#x27;m afraid there aren&#x27;t any at this moment in time – neither Sega nor Atlus have dropped any clues as to what the presentation may entail beyond confirming that the show is expected to last around 50 minutes.

                              <span>After &quot;diligently monitoring your feedback&quot;, Blizzard has posted the notes for its upcoming 1.1.3 Diablo 4 patch, which is set to roll out on all platforms next week.

First up on the docket are Monsters, and specifically, the monster abilities and elite affixes that apply to Crowd Control effects. Blizzard says these changes are aimed at the player having &quot;less time being Crowd Controlled and receiving more recovery time after being Crowd Controlled, especially at higher World Tiers&quot;.

From 29th August onwards, Cold Enchanted Elites that attack in quick succession, such as Ghost Archers and Snake Brutes, will&quot; no longer proc the Cold Enchanted on every hit&quot;, and Chilling Wind will &quot;spawn overlapping walls less often&quot;.

                              <span>Genshin Impact fans are reporting that malicious players are using its co-op feature to infiltrate other players&#x27; worlds and delete in-game items like seele, chests, and elemental totems, preventing them from progressing. 

Right now, the issue is primarily affecting players on the Chinese server, but given the issue appears to permanently &quot;brick&quot; progress – even if you reinstall the game or play on a different device – all players are warned not to join any stranger&#x27;s co-op game until the issue has been resolved. 

According to some players affected by the issue, the &quot;destruction is irreversible&quot;. This video, for instance, shows how an elemental totem – used to get around the world – was deleted, bricking the player&#x27;s time-limited challenges and preventing them from progressing.

                              <span>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners eagerly awaiting the previously announced August release of ghost hunting hit Phasmophobia will now have a bit longer to wait; developer Kinetic Games has opted to push launch back to October after a &quot;recent fire incident&quot;.


Phasmophobia first made waves when it launched into early access on PC back in September 2020, quickly amassing an enthusiastic following after streamers helped propel its spooky investigatory ghost hunting action - which sees players attempting to gather evidence and complete objectives across a variety of haunted locales - up the charts as Halloween struck.


Since then, Kinetic Games has continued to expand and evolve the core co-operative ghost hunting experience with new maps, new equipment, new ghost types, better haunting AI, and, more recently, custom difficulty settings. And with the PC version developing nicely, a console release was confirmed earlier this year, with the studio announcing Phasmophobia would hit PlayStation 5 (including PSVR2) and Xbox Series X/S this August.

                              <span>What&#x27;s happening with Hyenas? Announced a year ago but still without a release date, Creative Assembly&#x27;s team-based sci-fi extraction shooter was playable publicly this week for the first time at Gamescom in Cologne, following a somewhat eye-opening summation of its status last week from Sega top brass.


I played a brief match of Hyenas on the Gamescom showfloor and found it a bright and breezy shooter with fun PVPVE moments and some promising zero-G sections. But my time with it was too brief to really leave with much of a lasting impression. 


It&#x27;s good news, then, that Hyenas will soon be available to play more widely, via a Steam beta test you can sign up for now, with access going live on 31st August. It&#x27;s from that, I think, that people will finally be able to decide for themselves what is working and what is not - and this is Creative Assembly told me it is waiting for as well.

                              <span>A little over three years after acclaimed construction and automation sim Factorio left its lengthy early access with a 1.0 release, developer Wube Software has shared details of its first expansion, Space Age, which will be picking up right where the base game stops.


Factorio, for the uninitiated, casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation. The ultimate goal is to build a rocket ship enabling you to escape the planet you&#x27;ve crash-landed on, which is the point where Space Age kicks in.


In a post revealing first concrete details of Factorio&#x27;s expansion, Wube explained Space Age continues the journey after those rockets have launched, taking players out among the stars where they can &quot;discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage [their] fleet of interplanetary space platforms.&quot;

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s two single-player modes have been detailed and were playable at this year&#x27;s Gamescom event.


The first is Invasion mode, which turns the fighting game into a Mario Party-esque boardgame. Players will choose a character and explore an area through branching paths, with each node offering a new challenge to overcome before progressing.


These comprise a mixture of individual battles, minigames and treasures, with extra modifiers offering a twist on typical gameplay. Perhaps fire-shooting demons or a fiery vortex will interrupt battle, plus plenty more.

&lt;
blockquote&gt;In the south-west Atlantic moratorium area, Oceana found there had been no fishing conducted by Chinese fleets in the same time period in 2019. Between 1,800 and 8,500 fishing hours were detected in the zone in each of the five years to 2019. In the eastern Pacific zone, China’s fishing fleet appeared to fish only 38 hours in the year before the ban’s introduction...</span>

As spotted by the ever keen eyes of the Starfield community over on Reddit and shared by US arrests site RecentlyBooked.com, 29-year-old Darin Harris was processed by the Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff&#x27;s Office yesterday, 24th August.

Harris was charged with theft of property valued between $2,500-$10,000 USD, theft of property valued at $1,000 or less, and for possession of marijuana. As noted by Kotaku, Harris had been spotted uploading listings for numerous copies of Starfield - including its premium Constellation Edition - on the Japanese e-commerce platform Mercari prior to his arrest.

                              <span>Following Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS 3.5 announcements at Gamescom, AMD has finally revealed FSR 3 - along with a separate frame generation solution that works on all DX11 and DX12 titles. In a meeting with AMD, Digital Foundry saw both technologies in action and came away impressed.
FSR 3 is a frame generation solution that operates along similar lines to Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS 3 - combining frame generation (Fluid Motion Frames) with super resolution upscaling (FSR 2) and latency reduction (Anti-Lag+) in a small number of supported games, with Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum set to first debut the technology. FSR 3 will work on Radeon graphics cards, as well as Nvidia and Intel GPUs. 
So, how does FSR 3 look? At Gamescom, we had a demonstration of both titles running with the new technology active on a Radeon 7900 XTX running at 4K output. Both were running with v-sync on, which AMD recommends for frame-pacing purposes. In the very small Forspoken demo we saw, the game was running locked at 120 frames per second and looked just as a v-synced 120fps should look. The game was running in FSR 2 quality mode providing its own frame-rate boost, with frame-gen then taking you up to the limit. In terms of fluidity and clarity, FSR 3 looked a match for DLSS 3 - a view shared by Alex, Rich and John, who were all present to see the demos in person. A great start for FSR 3.

                              <span>AMD has officially unveiled its RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT graphics cards, finally completing its RDNA 3 lineup after announcing its first GPUs in November last year. Both cards are intended to target 1440p displays and run games at max settings, including ray tracing, above 60fps. They&#x27;ll also support AMD&#x27;s exciting new frame generation technologies, which we&#x27;ve written up as a separate article after going hands-on with FSR 3 and Fluid Motion Frames at Gamescom. 
Both graphics cards use the new Navi 32 GPU. The 7800 XT gets the fully-enabled 60CU version with a 256-bit memory bus, 64MB of Infinity Cache and 16GB of GDDR6 memory running at 19.5Gbps, while the 7700 XT is cut-down - but not by much at all. It uses a 54CU design with a 192-bit bus and 48MB of Infinity Cache, backed with 12GB of GDDR6 running at 18Gbps. TDP figures are also very similar, at 245W vs 263W, with the 7700 XT clocked higher to make up for its lower CU complement. 
AMD&#x27;s performance data looks impressive here, with the RX 7800 XT trading blows with the RTX 4070 and the RX 7700 XT more convincingly dealing with the RTX 4060 Ti. Both cards are also shown exceeding 60fps at max settings in a host of recent AAA releases, including The Last of Us Part 1, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Hogwarts Legacy and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

                              <span>Excitebike 64 will be roaring onto consoles via Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack next week.


From 30th August, those on Nintendo&#x27;s subscription service will be able to rev it up and grind their way through the extreme sport world that is motocross. This will see players taking part in death defying stunts - or at the very least attempting them - as they zoom around the various tracks and courses.


 Nintendo has released a rather brilliant, and totally epic, trailer to announce the game&#x27;s impending arrival on the Switch, which you can see below.

To commemorate this milestone, the Pokémon team is rewarding all users with a special gift. 


If you are one of those partaking 10 million slumberers, head over to the app now and make sure you have it updated to version 1.0.6. Then, you should be able to find this gift of 1000 Sleep Points, one Good Camp Ticket, three Ingredient Tickets and five Poké Biscuits. Lovely.

This update will address a myriad of issues in the game, with the developer stating it will target a rather substantial 1000 bugs, as well as &quot;balancing, flow issues and much, much more&quot;. 


As Larian joked, it is so immense, the patch notes couldn&#x27;t be detailed in their entirety on Steam, as they exceeded the platform&#x27;s text limit.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard is currently taking part in the great big Starfield marketing push of 2023. But, it isn&#x27;t just the studio&#x27;s upcoming space game that we have all been waiting for. Another of Howard and Bethesda&#x27;s flagship series is Elder Scrolls, and ever since it was announced that The Elder Scrolls 6 was indeed in the pipeline, many have been eager to hear more about what&#x27;s next. 


The thing is, this next chapter was announced years ago. A little over five years ago, in fact. And since then, we have heard very little about it at all. Back in 2021 Bethesda said it was in a design phase, but from the outside looking in, it is still largely just a name on gaming&#x27;s often vast horizon. 


Now admittedly, at the time of its reveal, Bethesda was keen to make sure everyone knew Elder Scrolls 6 was still a way out, and said it was in pre-production. But, even so, that was back in 2018. So, does the studio regret announcing this next chapter well before its actual release date, which still remains an unknown (although we do know it will be before Fallout 5)?

Sega&#x27;s Switch version takes the exuberant rhythm-action of the Dreamcast original - where the goal is essentially to orientate your maraca-ing arms to match the position shown on screen then shake in time with the prompts - but slings in new mini-game-like interludes as songs progress.


Additionally, Love Checker mode is back for those eager to gauge their compatibility with a partner based on the accuracy of their maraca-ing prowess, and there&#x27;s an online multiplayer mode, where the aim is to keep the beat and avoid being eliminated.

                              <span>We&#x27;re big fans of developer Jump Over The Age&#x27;s highly acclaimed tabletop-inspired narrative RPG Citizen Sleeper here at Eurogamer, so July&#x27;s sequel reveal was a happy day indeed; and while there&#x27;s still some way to go until it&#x27;s release, creator Gareth Damian Martin has now shared a few new details, including confirmation it&#x27;ll be heading to Game Pass.


Speaking in a video shared by Xbox as part of its Gamescom activities (hence the Game Pass focus), Martin explained Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will once again combine &quot;free-form table-top RPG inspired dice-based gameplay with slice-of-life stories and relatable characters&quot; - only, this time, it&#x27;ll be &quot;bigger, more varied, more challenging&quot;.


Citizen Sleeper 2 brings a new, malfunctioning Sleeper android protagonist and a new setting in the Starward Belt, on the edge of the Helion System. One of its biggest changes, though, is that players get their own ramshackle ship and can assemble its crew, which Martin says is an attempt to &quot;capture what&#x27;s special about stories like Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, where it&#x27;s not about hauling tonnes of titanium across the galaxy but...getting into trouble with a complex cast of characters, improvising, making do, and always running on the edge of disaster.&quot;

                              <span>As Fortnite&#x27;s stellar current season draws to a close (seriously, the jungle is fab), Epic is cranking the hype handle in anticipation of tomorrow&#x27;s Chapter 4 Season 4, now officially titled The Final Resort, with a first trailer revealing some of what&#x27;s to come.


Epic has been teasing a heist theme on social media for a couple of days now, but today&#x27;s trailer makes things official in a big way, showing a new cast of characters - almost certainly this season&#x27;s Battle Pass gang - infiltrating a luxury mansion to retrieve a golden skull belonging to Fortnite character Oro (who has some nebulous connection to earlier antagonist Midas, but without Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips&#x27; encyclopaedic Fortnite lore knowledge, I have no idea what the implications of this might be).


As the trailer&#x27;s heist plays out, we see lightning grenades, laser traps, a portable gun turret sneakily concealed in a briefcase (I&#x27;d imagine we can safely say all of that will be making an appearnce to spice up this season&#x27;s gameplay), and, yes, an alarming muscular Fishsticks, proving there&#x27;s plenty more where that cat with a six-pack and swole unicorn came from.

There are the typical high-pressure lobbying tactics and lawsuits. But there’s also examples of companies hacking the laws:
Companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz have begun designing their products so that their packages don’t have a true front or back, but rather two nearly identical labels—except for the fact that only one side has the required warning. As a result, supermarket clerks often place the products with the warning facing inward, effectively hiding it...</span>

This post explains how to use the new sidecar feature, which enables restartable init containers and is available in alpha in Kubernetes 1.28. We want your feedback so that we can graduate this feature as soon as possible.
The concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. In 2015, sidecars were described in a blog post about composite containers as additional containers that “extend and enhance the ‘main’ container”. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without n…</span>

The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support
for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis.
Now, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many
new improvements.
Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems.
This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization
when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial
design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory
was detected on a node.
In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This represented
a sign…</span>

When Halloween comes around, we will be able to get to grips with Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s immeasurably tall tower across Steam, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5. It will also be releasing day one on Game Pass. 


The developer shared a new gameplay trailer to accompany this news, which highlights some of the different ways players will be able to approach their great accent. It also gives a little look at some of the biomes we can expect to traverse on release, which are home to some &quot;unique flora and fauna&quot;. You can have a watch below.

The recent RPG has seen a roaring success on PC, where it launched earlier this month. It is set to come to PlayStation 5 on 6th September. 


However, Xbox has been notably absent from the release schedule thus far, with split-screen gameplay on Series S being the main sticking point.

Pirates got their first taste of Rare&#x27;s take on Mêlée Island - conjured into existence from the memories of Guybrush Threepwood, thanks to some magical shenanigans relating to Sea of Thieves&#x27; purgatorial Sea of the Damned - back in July, in an adventure that admirably captured the series&#x27; point-and-click ambience in exploratory first-person 3D.


As you might recall, that first episode - titled The Journey to Mêlée Island - concluded with the return of a certain big bad, and while there are still plenty of unknowns around episode two, The Quest for Guybrush, Rare has already teased that the impassable fog previously preventing exploration beyond Mêlée island&#x27;s port town will lift, giving players access to the whole of the island and some iconic locations from the series&#x27; history.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 is set to release next month. Following the base game&#x27;s launch, DLC characters (kharacters?) will join the game. 


Two such characters will be The Boys&#x27; Homelander and Omni-Man from Invincible. While both of these superhero-types are popular in their own right, they are also remarkably similar in many ways. This is something that had caused the Mortal Kombat 1 community a touch of concern. 


However, concerned we should not be, at least according to Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon. Speaking with IGN, the developer said these two cape-wearing, super-strong chaps will not be clones of each other when they swoop into the game.

Speaking to The Wrap, Mazin stated the team hadn&#x27;t spoken about spin-offs themselves, as everyone&#x27;s keeping their focus on the games&#x27; main narratives of Joel and Ellie. 


However, while the showrunner may not be dipping his toe into the spin-off waters any time soon, he is &quot;not against the idea of other shows that may draw from these characters or that world&quot;.

                              <span>Luna, Amazon&#x27;s cloud-streaming service, is coming to certain LG televisions. This will enable users to stream games directly on their TV, without a console.


This feature will be coming to LG&#x27;s 2021-2023 Smart TV models for those of us here in the UK.


Those with 2023&#x27;s LG Smart TVs will be able to access their Luna games directly from the Home Screen Game Card. Meanwhile, those with Smart TVs from 2021/22 will be able to download the Luna app (which can be found on the LG content store).

                              <span>If the idea of another hulking Bethesda Games Studios role-playing game now being just days away has you excited, then you may also be pleased to hear details about what happens when you do eventually reach its end.


Yes, you can begin playing Starfield again via a New Game Plus mode, which Bethesda has now confirmed is present in Starfield.


Exactly what Starfield&#x27;s New Game Plus mode will allow is something we&#x27;ll need to play (and complete) the game to find out - whether it lets you carry over items as well as character upgrades when you replay the game&#x27;s story, for example.

                              <span>Is the relentless predictabilty of freighter life getting you down in No Man&#x27;s Sky? Well gloom no more because things are about to get a whole lot rowdier thanks to the exploratory space sim&#x27;s latest free update, Echoes, which introduces epic freighter-to-freighter battles and Star Wars-style trench runs, alongside a new robot race and more today, 24th August.


Starting with those freighter battles, Echoes - which got the tiniest of teases to celebrate No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s seventh birthday at the end of last week - expands on the game&#x27;s previous system, which made it possible for small ships (whether they be piloted by players or NPC pirates) to attack friendly freighters and fleets. Come Echoes&#x27; arrival, however, players can encounter situations where merchant fleets are instead under attack from aggressive pirates freighters officially known as Dreadnoughts - which they&#x27;ll have the option to defend against and defeat. 


In time-honoured video game fashion, that involves attacking their weak spots, which is where the Star-Wars-style trench runs come in, requiring pilots to zip along narrow corridors in their opponents&#x27; hull to shoot their red blinky things (a combat HUD overhaul now handily displays the hull integrity of large vessels) until they&#x27;re completely atomised.

It is set to arrive later this year, on 4th October. So, not too much longer to wait. 


Along with this news, developer Fatshark treated us all to a brand new teaser for its upcoming Xbox release. You can see it for yourself in the video below.

Speaking with IGN at Gamescom, Xbox head Phil Spencer stated there is a lot more to getting a game on its subscription service than many may realise. 


&quot;I want to make sure people know that there&#x27;s work to actually move games to Game Pass,&quot; the exec stated when asked about Activision&#x27;s shooter coming to the service. &quot;So, for people who think like, &#x27;the deal is going to close, and then everything&#x27;s available on Game Pass&#x27; - that&#x27;s not true.&quot;

Rumblings earlier in the year had the upcoming sequel pegged with a December release date.

Speaking to Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz at Gamescom, Xbox chief marketing officer Jerret West said he believes Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space opera is the &quot;doorway&quot; to more regular Xbox exclusives.


&quot;I was sitting there watching the same [Starfield presentation] you were this morning and I was like... this is really the start of something that&#x27;s going to then lead to Forza, then in 2024 as we go to Hellblade, and we think about Towerborne which is on the show floor, we think about Avowed, and we&#x27;ve got stories we haven&#x27;t told yet as well, that are going to unfurl in 2024 and 2025,&quot; West shared, calling this lineup a &quot;multi-year relay race of first-party titles&quot; with Starfield the &quot;starting gun&quot;.

Once this period of exclusivity ends, the split will revert back to the store&#x27;s original set up of 88 percent going to developers, and 12 percent going to Epic.

                              <span>Starfield might be hogging the spotlight right now, but that doesn&#x27;t mean Bethesda has forgotten about its other babies; Fallout - or more specifically its upcoming live-action TV adaptation - is, for instance, having a bit of a moment right now following a brief Gamescom showing and confirmation from Amazon that it&#x27;s launching in 2024.


Amazon first announced it was adopting Fallout for its Prime Video streaming service back in the summer of 2020, and since then, we&#x27;ve had ample casting news, on-set photos (official and otherwise), but nothing in the way of a trailer.


That&#x27;s now (sort of) changed courtesy of a Starfield presentation held at Gamescom today. Amid the space RPG&#x27;s strictly hands-off showing, designer Todd Howard slipped in what he called a &quot;sneak peek&quot; at Amazon&#x27;s upcoming Fallout show.

                              <span>SteamWorld Build, the &quot;Anno meets Dungeon Keeper&quot; city builder from Thunderful Games and internal studio The Station, finally has a release date and will be forging new frontiers on PC, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Game Pass from 1st December.


SteamWorld Build is, of course, the latest in the genre-hopping SteamWorld series, which has so far explored the likes of platform mining in SteamWorld Dig and its sequel, tower defense in the appropriately titled SteamWorld Tower Defense, turn-based strategy in SteamWorld Heist, and card-battling RPGing in SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech.


It&#x27;s all change again for SteamWorld Build, which this time challenges players to construct a city - or, more specifically, a sort of sci-fi-infused Wild West mining town - in a bid to attract enough Steambot workers to dig deep into the nearby abandoned mines which, or so it&#x27;s rumoured, contain ancient technology that&#x27;ll help everyone get off the dying world.

                              <span>BioWare has announced it&#x27;ll be laying off approximately 50 employees - approximately 20 percent of its total workforce according to recent employment figures - as part of a &quot;shift towards a more agile and more focused studio&quot;.


&quot;In order to meet the needs of our upcoming projects, continue to hold ourselves to the highest standard of quality, and ensure BioWare can continue to thrive in an industry that&#x27;s rapidly evolving,&quot; BioWare general manager Gary McKay wrote in a post shared on the developer&#x27;s website, &quot;we must shift towards a more agile and more focused studio. It will allow our developers to iterate quickly, unlock more creativity, and form a clear vision of what we&#x27;re building before development ramps up.&quot;


&quot;To achieve this,&quot; McKay continued, &quot;we find ourselves in a position where change is not only necessary, but unavoidable. As difficult as this is to say, rethinking our approach to development inevitably means reorganising our team to match the studio&#x27;s changing needs.&quot;

                              <span>Six years after it gave Turok 2 the remaster treatment and eight since it did the same to part one, retro specialist Nightdive Studios is back to finish what it started, and is concluding the trilogy with a Turok 3 remaster for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 14th November.


Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion, as it&#x27;s more formally known, initially launched for N64 and Game Boy Color (albeit in a considerably different form) back in 2000, around about the same time Jarvis Cocker was meeting up by the fountain down the road. For the trilogy&#x27;s final outing, players could choose between two protagonists - Joseph and Danielle Fireseed, siblings of Turok 2 protagonist Joshua Fireseed - as they worked to defeat the Oblivion and its Flesh Eater followers in another bout of dinosaur-flavoured first-person shooter action.


Turok 3&#x27;s remaster - which uses the N64 version as its base - marks the first time the game has been available since its original release, and Nightdive is promising a range of improvements, including enhanced environment art, character models, and updated weapon models, alongside &quot;advanced rendering features&quot; that&#x27;ll include the likes of anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 27 years since Revolution Software&#x27;s Broken Sword series introduced the world to protagonists George Stobbart and Nicole Collard, but the adventurous twosome still aren&#x27;t ready for retirement just yet; they&#x27;re returning for a new adventure, Broken Sword - Parzival&#x27;s Stone, and a remake of their first outing, Shadow of the Templars, coming early next year.


Parzival&#x27;s Stone will be the sixth entry in the Broken Sword series - following on from Shadow of the Templars, The Smoking Mirror, The Sleeping Dragon, The Angel of Death, and 2013&#x27;s The Serpent&#x27;s Cruse - and will once again be helmed by series originator Charles Cecil.


It sees George and Nico getting caught up in terrifying conspiracy featuring Nazi treasure hunters, brutal mediaeval histories, and Quantum Physics, where ruthless technology entrepreneurs, corrupt government agencies, and billion-dollar global energy corporations are all battling for possession of a manuscript pointing to the secret location of the mythical thousand-year-old Grail, just perhaps not the one we&#x27;re used to hearing about.

As reported by the BBC, 18-year-old Arion Kurtaj and a 17-year-old, who cannot be named due to their age, carried out multiple hacks, targeting companies including Nvidia and BT.


In addition to this, Kurtaj has been found instrumental in Rockstar Games&#x27; monumental Grand Theft Auto 6 hack last year.

The date was revealed at yesterday&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live, along with a new trailer.


&quot;Step into the boots of Grayson Hunt after a crash landing on an abandoned resort planet forces him to make a hard choice: survival or revenge,&quot; the accompanying blurb reads.

                              <span>Twitch has launched its Discovery Feed experiment to a select number of users.


Earlier this year, Twitch announced its plans to introduce a new Stories and Discovery feature to the platform, with the idea that this would provide streamers with a further way to reach their followers when not live streaming.


As Ed reported at the time, the stories in this case would last for 24 hours and appear on the Twitch mobile app. It is a similar approach that other social media platforms have adopted.

                              <span>Phil Spencer has said that Xbox must have a mobile presence in order for the brand to continue to thrive.


In an interview with Eurogamer today at Gamescom in Cologne, Spencer emphasised the importance of mobile for Xbox to continue to grow its audience - and said it was the core reason behind Microsoft&#x27;s interest in buying Activision Blizzard (including its mobile arm King) for $68.7bn.


&quot;The reason we&#x27;re in the acquisition discussion with Activision Blizzard King is around their mobile capability,&quot; Spencer told me. &quot;Because it&#x27;s just something we don&#x27;t have.

It&#x27;s called the PlayStation Portal remote player, and promises to bring that PS5 experience to the palm of our hands. As Sony previously said, it will come with the features of a DualSense wireless controller, such as adaptive triggers and haptic feedback.


Meanwhile, the remote player&#x27;s screen will be &quot;capable&quot; of 1080p resolution at 60fps.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 includes audio descriptive fatalities. 


This accessibility feature is exactly as it sounds - it will allow players to hear what is happening on screen thanks to audio description. This will, of course, be a game changer for blind or partially sighted players.


GamesHub managing editor Edmond Tran shared a video showing this feature in action over on X (formerly Twitter).

Eurogamer was able to see an early screening, so can share what was seen.


Phil Spencer told the audience Todd Howard had described the game to him as &quot;irresponsibly large&quot;, but here&#x27;s how the journey begins. Spoilers ahead.

                              <span>After much anticipation, Starfield&#x27;s release is a mere matter of weeks away. And, in a bid to keep the hype train running, Bethesda has shared an all new live-action trailer for its upcoming space extravaganza. 


Revealed as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, the trailer kicks off with an orchestral version of Elton John&#x27;s Rocket Man. It then shows a young girl, eyes bright and full of wonder, making her way to the launch pad of an equally bright eyed astronaut. He gives her a Constellation badge, and then blasts off into the atmosphere to deal with space battles, planet exploration and, perhaps, a touch of radioactivity. 


It is all rather atmospheric, although I am still hopeful that we will see some more gameplay before the game&#x27;s final release. You can have a watch of Starfield&#x27;s live-action trailer in the video below.

                              <span>Several years after it first launched, Cyberpunk 2077 is getting an update so impressive, it feels like we are about to see the game&#x27;s true potential, as it was promised many moons ago, finally realised. 


As part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, developer CD Projekt Red unveiled a brand new teaser for its upcoming DLC - Phantom Liberty - which releases next month. Known as the &#x27;New Ways to Play&#x27; trailer, it gave us a taste of what&#x27;s in store for Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s future. 


The trailer gave us a closer look at some new weapons that will be introduced in the Phantom Liberty expansion, such as the Rasetsu sniper rifle and the Grit handgun. It also showed off redesigned cyberware, perks, the Relic skill tree, new vehicles (including vehicle combat, which will see players able to shoot out of the car while driving and the ability to &quot;quickhack&quot; enemies on the road), and a new police system.

                              <span>Gamescom 2023 has kicked off - as you might have noticed - and Nvidia has unveiled DLSS 3.5, a new version of DLSS that adds &#x27;ray reconstruction&#x27; -  essentially AI-tuned denoising that boosts the quality of ray tracing effects on RTX graphics cards. The firm also announced a new community remaster of the legendary Half-Life 2, new DLSS 3 and Reflex titles and more. 
Let&#x27;s cover the DLSS 3.5 news first, as this is fascinating. The critical information here is that real-time ray tracing relies on a relatively small number of rays that are cast - certainly far fewer than one ray per pixel - so we don&#x27;t have a complete picture of the &#x27;ground truth&#x27;, we have an image with both signal and noise. That means a denoising step is required to fill in the missing pixels, which uses techniques like temporal acculuation and spatial interpolation to generate a higher-quality final image. 
So far, so standard. Normally these denoisers are hand-tuned, but the innovation is that Nvidia has trained an AI network (on five times as much data as they used to train DLSS 3) that can achieve better results. It can use different methods with different ray-traced effects, recognise good pixels and discard bad pixels, and retain the high frequency detail that would normally be smoothed away by upscaling.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures anthology studio Supermassive Games is developing Little Nightmare 3 for release in 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch. It&#x27;ll be playable solo, with an AI-controlled second character, or with a friend in online co-op.


This announcement marks a change of studio for the Little Nightmare franchise, after the first two games in the series were created by Swedish developer Tarsier Studios. But this isn&#x27;t unexpected - Tarsier were bought by European megapublisher Embracer back in 2021, which stated at the time that Tarsier would now work on something else.


The rights to Little Nightmares remained with publisher Bandai Namco, meanwhile, which already tapped the UK-based Supermassive to work on the Enhanced Edition of Little Nightmares 2 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

                              <span>Bungie has given Destiny 2&#x27;s next expansion, The Final Shape, a thorough unveiling, confirming it&#x27;ll whisk players to the &quot;infinite, vast, unknowable&quot; Pale Heart within the Traveler when it launches for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 27th February next year.


As per Bungie&#x27;s info-heavy reveal livestream, The Final Shape - described as &quot;the last expedition of Destiny&#x27;s first saga&quot; - will see players entering the Traveler via the portal opened at the end of this year&#x27;s Lightfall expansion for a showdown with current big bad, the Witness. It&#x27;s an adventure Bungie says will &quot;answer questions on a grander scale&quot; while also giving players the opportunity to connect with familiar companions on a more personal level.


That, of course, includes the formerly deceased fan-favourite Cayde-6, played by Nathan Fillion, who appears to be making a return as a Virgil-style guide manifested by the Pale Heart itself. Seemingly, this world inside the Traveler has reality shaping power that the Witness is attempting to use to refashion the universe in a vision of frozen perfection - the Final Shape of the title - but, as the Guardians enter the Pale Heart, it shifts to reflect their experiences too.

And, thanks to developer NetherRealm&#x27;s later trailer - confirming the return of Sindel, General Shao, Motaro, and Shujinko - you&#x27;ll never look at a ponytail in the same way again.


These four latest additions to Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s line-up get their introductions in a trailer blending story cinematics and fighting action that, narratively, appears to happen relatively early on in proceedings as Raiden is welcomed into the fold as Earthrealm&#x27;s champion.


Skepticism almost immediately ensues from General Shao and chums, but doubts are soon laid as we switch to a fresh chunk of typically brutal, bone-shattering in-game fighting action that sees Raiden paired with Shujinko and Sindel with Motaro.

                              <span>A brand-new and rather unsettling trailer for Alan Wake 2 rounded off Gamescom Opening Night Live this evening. 


Remedy&#x27;s creative director Sam Lake introduced the trailer for the upcoming sequel, addressing Alan&#x27;s struggle (putting it mildly) to escape the &quot;nightmare dimension&quot; of the Dark Place. This is somewhere the poor novelist has been trapped for the last 13 years, because yes it really has been that long since the first Alan Wake was originally released. 


The new trailer was a combination of in-game live-action footage, in-game cinematics and gameplay, with Lake stating this was to show &quot;the dream-like nature of the Dark Place&quot;.

The game is an ode to the hometown in Northern England of its creators Will Todd and James Carbutt who comprise developer Coal Supper. It follows their first game The Good Time Garden, inspired by 90s kids TV and The Beano comic.


&quot;With our first game, we basically followed our noses as far as a shoestring budget and our spare time would allow - so it&#x27;s been an amazing opportunity to run down that rabbit hole with Panic behind us, and we&#x27;re excited to show the world what we&#x27;ve found at the bottom,&quot; said Coal Supper.

The real-time strategy title will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 17th November.


Frontier says Age of Sigmar is being designed for both RTS experts and newcomers to the genre, with the benefit of a &quot;cinematic&quot; campaign to get you started in single-player before braving 1v1 or 2v2 competitive multiplayer.

How would we govern ourselves?
It’s unlikely that we would use the systems we have today. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government that mid-eighteenth-century technology could conceive of. The twenty-first century is a different place scientifically, technically and socially...</span>

The podresources API is an API served by the kubelet locally on the node, which exposes the compute resources exclusively
allocated to containers. With the release of Kubernetes 1.28, that API is now Generally Available.
What problem does it solve?
The kubelet can allocate exclusive resources to containers, like
CPUs, granting exclusive access to full cores
or memory, either regions or hugepages.
Workloads which require high performance, or low latency (or both) leverage these features.
The kubelet also can assign devices to containers.
Collectively, these features which enable exclusive assignments are known as &quot;resource managers&quot;.
Without an API like podresources, the only possible option to learn about resource assignment was to read the state files th…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re old enough to remember the days when consoles were made of wood and powered by the hopes and dreams of a better future, you might be excited to know Atari is bringing its classic 70s/80s console, the Atari 2600, back as a &quot;modern day faithful recreation&quot; - and it&#x27;ll even play original cartridges if you still have some lying around behind your Zimmer frame.


The Atari 2600+, as this updated version of the classic console is officially known, has been birthed into the world through the frantic conjoining of Atari and Plaion (formerly Koch Media), and is set to release on 17th November for £99.99/€119.99/$129.99, which is, if nothing else, cheaper than it would have cost you back in 1977.


This new-fangled update features a couple of modern-day revisions including HDMI output, USB power, and multiple screen resolutions, but the selling point here, really, is how close is adheres to the Atari 2600&#x27;s iconic design - wood panel frontage and all.

                              <span>Video game film and TV adaptations seem to be coming at us from all directions these days, however Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert isn&#x27;t keen to see his piratical puzzler head in this direction. 


Speaking at Devcom earlier this week, Gilbert and fellow Monkey Island developers chatted about the most recent release in the series, Return to Monkey Island. 


Along with the discussion about the game&#x27;s conception and art style (something that Gilbert defended on Return&#x27;s announcement last year), the topic turned to film projects based on the series.

                              <span>Another Pokémon that we will be required to catch in our bid to finally have them all has been revealed. 


In a rather haunting trailer, we were introduced to Poltchageist, a transformed tea caddy. Poltchageist is a grass and ghost type Pokémon that holds the spirit, or at least the regret, of a once rather strict and cantankerous tea master.


According to this new trailer, Poltchageist can go around blowing matcha over people, and then inhale (?) that matcha back into its caddy, seeping some of the inflicted person&#x27;s life force as it does so. This is something, as you can see in the trailer below, it does to a room full of innocent children. But, it winks at us at the end, so I am sure they are all ok... right?

In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Konami said all platforms except for the Switch have a 1080p/60fps target. So, that&#x27;s across  PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S and PC. 


Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console, meanwhile, will run at 720p/30fps in handheld mode, although Konami has said it will target 1080p/30fps when docked.

The production company recently partnered with game developer Monomi Park to bring the colourful slime vacuuming series to a new medium. 


As reported by Deadline, the two companies are looking to continue the story of Beatrix LeBeau on the big screen, however no studios appear to be attached to the project at this time.

This collborative update, which is avaiable now, is part of Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s anniversary celebrations, with the dungeon-crawling management sim recently turning one. 


However, don&#x27;t expect to see your flock enjoying a knees up meal with cake and party poppers as part of this crossover. Rather, the team has introduced a new game mode known as Penitence, which will see your Lamb needing to &quot;eat and sleep to survive, along with their followers&quot; for the occasion.

The upcoming game, which is described as a 2.5D &quot;retro-futuristic sci-fi&quot; title set in an alternative version of the 1980s, was due to release later this year across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC. 


In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Belarusian-based developer Sad Cat Studio said it &quot;truly [wants] Replaced to be something special and memorable for everybody&quot; and can&#x27;t &quot;afford to release a sub-par game&quot;. Therefore, the team made the decision to delay its launch into next year.

This includes gameplay, cinematics and customisation options.

                              <span>Microsoft has agreed to sell the streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft if completes its $68.7bn takeover of the Call of Duty publisher.


The move is a major change to Microsoft&#x27;s plans, but one it clearly feels is necessary to get the deal approved by hesitant UK regulators.


If the deal is now approved, streaming rights for all new Activision Blizzard PC and console games released over the next 15 years will be given to Ubisoft - with those rights then existing in perpetuity.

                              <span>Following last month&#x27;s confirmation that a planned sequel to Ubisoft&#x27;s enjoyable open-world romp Immortals: Fenyx Rising had been cancelled, new details of the ill-fated project have emerged, including word it would have combined elements of Elden Ring and Wind Waker to create a follow-up very different from the original.


As reported by Axios, citing two sources familiar with Immortals 2&#x27;s development, work on the project (codenamed Oxygen) began in 2021. It was to be a considerable departure from the 2020 original, ditching that game&#x27;s Greek mythology focus in favour of a setting inspired by Hawaiian Polynesian culture - as we&#x27;ve heard before. Other planned changes, according to Axios, included a more realistic graphical style, the removal of the first game&#x27;s narrator, less emphasis on puzzle solving, and the addition of a story driven by player choice.


Additionally, Immortals 2 was reportedly aiming to significantly shake up Ubisoft&#x27;s familiar open-world formula, trading an overabundance of quest markers and guidance in favour of an Elden-Ring-inspired set-up that would require players to figure out their own path forward - by tracking animals, navigating via the stars, or following the wind - as they sailed between and explored fictional islands inspired by the likes of New Zealand, Tahiti, Easter Island, and Hawaii.

                              <span>Ghostrunner 2, the sequel to developer One More Level&#x27;s acclaimed game of tough-as-nails cyberpunk parkour action and swearing extremely loudly at the screen, finally has a release date and will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 26th October.


Set one year after the events of the first game, Ghostrunner once again whizzes players, in the role of returning protagonist Jack, to a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk future for more &quot;FPP slasher&quot; action (I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not entirely sure what FPP stands for in this instance, but the PP made me laugh), this time battling against a violent AI cult.


Once again, katana violence and acrobatic parkour (I now realise at least one of the Ps might stand for &quot;parkour&quot;) are in order, with One More Level also promising a &quot;deeper exploration of the world beyond Dharma Tower&quot;, nonlinear levels with complex motorbike sections, more interactive bosses, plus &quot;exciting new modes&quot;.

                              <span>As if a couch co-op mode and a Switch release somehow wasn&#x27;t enough new Vampire Survivors stuff to be getting on with, developer Poncle has teased plenty more is still to come, confirming everything seen in a recent &quot;Directer&#x27;s Cut&quot; (yes, with an &quot;e&quot;) leak is real and on the way.


Images and footage of an unreleased Vampire Survivors Directer&#x27;s Cut build shown at a recent event began circulating earlier this month, and Poncle - writing in its update 1.6 release notes - has now acknowledged their existence, explaining, &quot;That&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve been doing in most events (since TGS 2022): hiding some of the future content for the game in plain sight.&quot;


While the developer says the menu screen - and presumably the &quot;Directer&#x27;s Cut&quot; name - featured in the leak might never actually appear in-game, everything else &quot;is scheduled to be fully developed and released in future free updates.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing like a public roadmap for Vampire Survivors&#x27; new content yet, but Poncle confirms &quot;dozens of characters and weapons&quot; are in development for &quot;2023 and beyond&quot; - and to accompany the news, it&#x27;s shared a teaser trailer giving some of that new stuff a first official airing.

                              <span>Microsoft is launching a range of official consoles wraps for Xbox Series X - including a design inspired by Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space RPG and sandwich-collecting sim Starfield - that&#x27;ll go on sale across Europe, Canada, and the US starting in October.


The new wraps consist of solid core panels layered with a fabric finish that are designed to fold around a console and provide a customisation option Microsoft describes as &quot;more affordable and more sustainable than purchasing a special edition or limited edition console&quot;. 


Wraps are secured in place through a combination of hook, loop, and silicon printing on the interior of each panel, and Microsoft says the design ensures vents are kept clear and, thanks to small &quot;feet&quot; at the bottom of each wrap, that air can flow freely through the Xbox Series X.

Typically, Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) technology is used to search for plates linked to specific crimes. But in this case it was used to examine the driving patterns of anyone passing one of Westchester County’s 480 cameras over a two-year period. Zayas’ lawyer Ben Gold contested the AI-gathered evidence against his client, decrying it as “dragnet surveillance.”...</span>

                              <span>This month&#x27;s launch of the widely-celebrated Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 highlighted the often-overlooked topic of video game credits, and the fact that many people who work for hundreds of hours on a project sometimes still do not get their name recognised. But why does this happen? And what is being done - across developers, publishers, localisation companies and industry bodies - to ensure the situation improves?


I&#x27;ve spoken to staff past and present at Altagram, the company which was publicly highlighted for failing to list its freelance localisation staff in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 credits, as well as localisation freelancers and the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), to find out. 

Below, Altagram&#x27;s CEO also offers an explanation for what went wrong specifically with Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - something they claim was simply an innocent mistake, after Larian previously asked for freelancer names to be provided.

The game was originally slated for 2023, but has been pushed back to prioritise the health of the team.


&quot;As many know, we&#x27;ve been hard at work bringing this idea to life for quite some time, and every day adds even more to a game we&#x27;re all proud of. In this final stretch however, it&#x27;s important to us that we stay true to ourselves, and not compromise on the team&#x27;s well being,&quot; reads a statement on X, formerly Twitter.

Your thumbs will certainly be happy as a new option has been added to remove button-mashing QTEs. To reel in the harpoon players need to button mash, which quickly gets tiring. Now you can select to hold the button instead.


Updates to the game&#x27;s UI include: adjusting the size particularly to support Steam Deck players; adding an inventory sorting function; and improved scrolling through vertical menus.

                              <span>IO Interactive has released a new update for Hitman: The World of Assassination. This update covers a large variety of issues, including that surprising &quot;death wall&quot; bug found on Hitman 2&#x27;s Isle of Sgail.


This bug saw poor, unexpecting NPCs dying instantly when they came into contact with a specific wall within the isolated North Atlantic castle. Which wall? Well, ironically one in the morgue. 


IO clearly didn&#x27;t want anything other than Agent 47 himself being responsible for the mysterious killings in Hitman, and therefore tried to fix the issue by adding some extra collision along the wall. However, this didn&#x27;t stop characters from dying instantly when they came into contact with the wall. So, instead, the Hitman team has, quite literally, boxed the wall in.

The social media exchange began with a post from one player claiming &quot;Lae&#x27;zel is the RPG party member equivalent of &#x27;the show gets really good after season four&#x27;&quot;. This was then shared - in a now-deleted post - by another user, adding if Lae&#x27;zel was male people would be swooning.


Gaider responded to this post, comparing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 to Dragon Age. &quot;Can confirm,&quot; he said. &quot;The Dragon Age fandom consistently gave WAY more latitude and forgiveness to male characters as opposed to female characters, in every game. It is very much a Thing.&quot;

In a statement posted to the game&#x27;s Discord community, Ironmace&#x27;s &quot;Graysun&quot; said that the team was &quot;fighting a difficult fight against cheaters&quot; and that addressing hacking was &quot;a serious priority&quot;.

&quot;Right now, we are fighting a difficult fight against cheaters as we gather information with Ironshield to deal with this situation,&quot; Graysun wrote.

The new AI cyber challenge (which is being abbreviated “AIxCC”) will have a number of different phases. Interested would-be competitors can now submit their proposals to the Small Business Innovation Research program for evaluation and, eventually, selected teams will participate in a 2024 “qualifying event.” During that event, the top 20 teams will be invited to a semifinal competition at that year’s DEF CON, another large cybersecurity conference, where the field will be further whittled down...</span>

This blog discusses two new features in Kubernetes 1.28 to improve Jobs for batch
users: Pod replacement policy
and Backoff limit per index.
These features continue the effort started by the
Pod failure policy
to improve the handling of Pod failures in a Job.
Pod replacement policy
By default, when a pod enters a terminating state (e.g. due to preemption or
eviction), Kubernetes immediately creates a replacement Pod. Therefore, both Pods are running
at the same time. In API terms, a pod is considered terminating when it has a
deletionTimestamp and it has a phase Pending or Running.
The scenario when two Pods are running at a given time is problematic for
some popular machine learning frameworks, such as
TensorFlow and JAX, which r…</span>

Former Blizzard developer Mark Kern tweeted a screenshot of Starfield&#x27;s start screen, saying: &quot;The physiognomy of start screens. The start screen of a game can reveal a lot about how rushed the team was and how much pride they took in their work. 

&quot;Starfield&#x27;s start screen either shows hasty shipping deadlines by a passionate team overworked, or a team that didn&#x27;t care.

All you need is one controller per player, and you can then add up to three additional people on the character-select screen. And yes, the Switch version launched with four-player co-op baked right in.

&quot;Today is a big day for our game as we are finally fulfilling half the game title: there are still no Vampires but at least there are SurvivorS now. We are adding a local co-op mode today!&quot; Poncle explains in the patch notes.

                              <span>Good news, Tomb Raider fans – rumour has it, &quot;breaking news&quot; is on the way.

As is usually the case with these kinds of things, we need to take it all with a very generous bucket of salt, but a recent update to the official Tomb Raider website is inviting players to sign up to be the &quot;first to hear&quot; about &quot;breaking news regarding the Tomb Raider franchise&quot;, including &quot;rewards, exclusives, merch, releases, and more&quot;.

So far, so what, right? Fair enough. However, pair the timing of the site&#x27;s sudden update with rumours that Crystal Dynamics was getting ready for a reveal later this year – which came from noted leaker Miller Ross, who accurately dropped information about Marvel&#x27;s Avengers ahead of schedule – and it&#x27;s enough to get Lara fans excited that the developer is gearing up to reveal a new game.

                              <span>Ubisoft is running another closed beta for its upcoming swashbucklin&#x27; adventure, Skull and Bones.

Setting sail at 3am UK time on 25th August (4am CEST; 7pm PT on 24th August in the US) and running until the 28th, the beta is only available on PC via Ubisoft Connect and is by invitation only. 

The beta test invites you to discover the red isle and the coast of Africa, wherein you&#x27;ll find the pirate den of Sainte Anne, which is &quot;ruled by John Scurlock, the local Kingpin&quot;. Here you&#x27;ll be able to interact with other players and NPCs, level up your weapons, ships, and equipment, as well as access your loot in your warehouse.

                              <span>Ghost-hunting sim Phasmophobia has just rolled out a hotfix to address some of the issues that crept in with its highly-anticipated Ascension update earlier this week.

The patch – which brings in an all-new levelling system at the cost of wiping out your progression, items, and virtual bank balance – rolled out on Thursday. Whilst it&#x27;s been welcomed by most of the community, a handful of issues – including performance woes and a problem with the falloff volume of ghosts, making hunts considerably trickier – have marred the launch.

Kinetic moved quickly to address reports raised by its community. For instance, one change includes shifting the Tier 3 lighter from a consumable item to a non-consumable one following player feedback, and another ensures that the T3 crucifix now has the correct five-metre radius.

Vonderhaar announced his departure on LinkedIn, promising that after 18 years with the franchise, the &quot;energy&quot; of the Call of Duty community &quot;will always be a massive part of [him]&quot;.

&quot;Today, I am sharing that I have left Activision and Treyarch after an incredible 18 years and eight Call of Duty games,&quot; Vonderhaar wrote in his LinkedIn post yesterday. &quot;To my co-workers at Treyarch, I am immensely grateful for the time we invested working to improve our craft, never sitting on successes, and always wondering how to improve what we design and how we produce it.

                              <span>Blizzard has opened up about the impact Overwatch 2 &quot;review bombers&quot; have had on the team, acknowledging that the &quot;dissatisfaction&quot; stems from &quot;the cancellation of the much larger component of PvE that was announced in 2019 [...] that Blizzard ultimately couldn&#x27;t deliver&quot;.  

In a statement posted to the game&#x27;s official website, Aaron Keller said that while being review bombed &quot;isn&#x27;t a fun experience&quot;, the plan was to &quot;move forward&quot; by &quot;adding to and improving Overwatch 2&quot;.

In less than 48 hours after its Steam debut, Blizzard&#x27;s free-to-play hero shooter became Steam&#x27;s &quot;worst game of all time&quot;.
