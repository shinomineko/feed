                              <span>Rough seas are hampering efforts to salvage the boat:
The Speranza Marie, carrying 16,000 pounds of squid and some 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel, hit the shoreline near Chinese Harbor at about 2 a.m. on Dec. 15.
Six crew members were on board, and all were rescued without injury by another fishing boat.
[…]
However, large swells caused by the recent storm caused the Speranza Marie to pull loose from it anchored position and drift about 100 yards from from its original grounded location in Chinese Harbor, according to the Coast Guard. 

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered...</span>

                              <span>Yet another smartphone side-channel attack: “EarSpy: Spying Caller Speech and Identity through Tiny Vibrations of Smartphone Ear Speakers“:
Abstract: Eavesdropping from the user’s smartphone is a well-known threat to the user’s safety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has quietly patched a security vulnerability that could give hackers access to compromised Switch, 3DS, and Wii U games.

Remember when Nintendo released its first update for Mario Kart 7 in 10 years? Well, it turns out that was to address a critical exploit that &quot;could allow an attacker to achieve full console takeover&quot;.

Whilst the issue was reportedly first noted back in 2021, PabloMK7, Rambo6Glaz, Fishguy6564 have been credited with the discovery of &quot;ENLBufferPwn&quot;, an exploit so serious, it was given a critical score of 9.8/10 in the CVSS 3.1 calculator.

But as well as referencing the game&#x27;s movie sequel, Netflix show, and Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers - all of which dropped in 2022, of course - Iizuka teased that there was &quot;a lot more outside of that&quot; still to come, too.

&quot;This past year was the biggest year in Sonic history, including the release of the movie sequel, new titles Sonic Origins and Sonic Frontiers, and the Netflix animation Sonic Prime,&quot; Sonic Team&#x27;s Iizuka told Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu and Nintendo Life).

                              <span>For the first time since August 2021, China&#x27;s video games regulator has approved the publishing licences of 45 international games, including Pokemon Unite, Don&#x27;t Starve, and Valorant.

As well as the games developed by studios outside of China, 84 domestic games have also been given the green light in China, which Reuters calls &quot;the world&#x27;s largest gaming market&quot;.

Chinese megacorps like Tencent and NetEase are amongst those receiving approval, with the former reportedly securing licences for six of its games in December.

                              <span>Surprise! Details of five unannounced Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets have popped up online.

According to the Instagram account of PromoBricks - a Lego site that&#x27;s successfully revealed unconfirmed Lego sets ahead of time before - the sets vary in size and complexity and will cost between $30 and $100 (that&#x27;s £25 to £82, although the final localised price may differ).

Beyond that, however, not much else is known, but you can get a sneaky peek at what the sets may entail in the image shared by PromoBricks (thanks, VGC).

                              <span>Former Sonic boss Yuji Naka has been formally indicted for insider trading offences. 

According to NHK and spotted by VGC, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office&#x27;s Special Investigation Department have indicted Naka and Taisuke Sasaki for investing millions of yen in a company based on insider information that had yet to be made public.

The prosecutors allege that neither Naka nor Saskai would have invested the ¥144.7m if they hadn&#x27;t known Square Enix was about to announce a partnership with a mobile developer.

                              <span>Valve&#x27;s new Steam Replay feature is here with a handy summary of your 2022 PC playtime.

Just like PlayStation&#x27;s annual Wrap-Up feature, Steam Replay tots up &quot;all of your playtime between the first second of January 1 and the last second of December 14 (GMT)&quot; - albeit only the games you&#x27;ve played whilst online; offline play and time spent &quot;running tools&quot; is not included - and presents it as a convenient infographic.

As well as a highlight panel that shows how much time you&#x27;ve spent on the games that have kept you busiest over the last 12 months (for me, it&#x27;s been indie ghosthunting hit Phasmophobia), you also get a summary of your achievements - including the &quot;rare&quot; ones - and your longest streak, as well as data that lets you know how you compare with the rest of Steam&#x27;s community.

In an interview with the New Yorker (thanks, Comicbook), Druckmann said he hoped that the show will &quot;put that video-game curse to bed&quot;, although screenwriter Craig Mazin acknowledged that it&#x27;s &quot;not the highest bar in the world&quot; to become a great adaptation given some games, like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, have &quot;impenetrable&quot; storylines.

&quot;I love the ability to wander, to do nothing, in Skyrim,&quot; Mazin said, before adding that &quot;that is not translatable!&quot; By contrast, however, he said that &quot;The Last of Us was always a story where the story comes first&quot;.

Following December&#x27;s Wreck the Halls Update, we&#x27;ve now been given an early peek at &quot;what&#x27;s arriving in early 2023&quot; for the people of Arkesia. 

The update has been divided into months for ease of access, and confirms that along with January&#x27;s Witcher Event, there&#x27;s also a quality-of-life update with unspecified improvements to guild systems, guild PvP, and Una&#x27;s Tasks.

                              <span>Microsoft has hit back at Sony&#x27;s objection to its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard by revealing that third-party games like Bloodborne, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Final Fantasy 16, and Silent Hill 2 Remake are party to &quot;exclusion&quot; agreements that will prevent those games from coming to Xbox consoles.

The news comes as part of Microsoft&#x27;s response to the FTC&#x27;s lawsuit against its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In the filing, Microsoft defends its position by turning the spotlight back onto Sony, detailing a handful of &quot;prominent&quot; games the company alleges have been barred from release on Xbox.

Whilst the filing acknowledges that &quot;exclusivity strategies are not uncommon in the games industry&quot;, Microsoft seems to take issue with Sony&#x27;s partnerships with third-party publishers, namely From Software, Square Enix, and Konami.

Like many artists, senior artist Frank Aliberti - who currently works as a senior character artist at 2K but formerly worked for PlayStation Studios Visual Arts - has his credits listed on ArtStation. 

It&#x27;s Aliberti&#x27;s work with PlayStation Studios Visual Arts that&#x27;s caught our collective attention, however, as Aliberti&#x27;s most recent credit indicated that they had worked as a senior artist on Death Stranding 2.

Albanian prosecutors on Wednesday asked for the house arrest of five public employees they blame for not protecting the country from a cyberattack by alleged Iranian hackers.
Prosecutors said the five IT officials of the public administration department had failed to check the security of the system and update it with the most recent antivirus software.

The next step would be to arrest managers at software companies for not releasing patches fast enough. And maybe programmers for writing buggy code. I don’t know where this line of thinking ends...</span>

The CPU Manager is a part of the kubelet, the Kubernetes node agent, which enables the user to allocate exclusive CPUs to containers.
Since Kubernetes v1.10, where it graduated to Beta, the CPU Manager proved itself reliable and
fulfilled its role of allocating exclusive CPUs to containers, so adoption has steadily grown making it a staple component of performance-critical
and low-latency setups. Over time, most changes were about bugfixes or internal refactoring, with the following noteworthy user-visible changes:
support explicit reservation of CPUs: it was already possible to request to reserve a given
number of CPUs for system resources, including the kubelet itself, which will not be used for exclusive CPU allocation. Now it is possible to also

                              <span>Last August, LastPass reported a security breach, saying that no customer information—or passwords—were compromised. Turns out the full story is worse:
While no customer data was accessed during the August 2022 incident, some source code and technical information were stolen from our development environment and used to target another employee, obtaining credentials and keys which were used to access and decrypt some storage volumes within the cloud-based storage service.
[…]
To date, we have determined that once the cloud storage access key and dual storage container decryption keys were obtained, the threat actor copied information from backup that contained basic customer account information and related metadata including company names, end-user names, billing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and the IP addresses from which customers were accessing the LastPass service...</span>

                              <span>Author: Wei Huang (Apple), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google)
Kubernetes 1.26 introduced a new Pod feature: scheduling gates. In Kubernetes, scheduling gates
are keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.
What problem does it solve?
When a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This
infinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.
Pods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)
waste scheduling cycles. A scheduling cycle may take ≅20ms or more depending on the complexity of
the Pod&#x27;s scheduling constraints. Therefore, at scale, those wasted cycles significantly impact the
scheduler&#x27;s performance. See …</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has taken a company using its trademarks and assets to advertise an NFT-based Pokémon mobile game to court. 


Australian company Pokémon Pty Ltd set up and advertised a website claiming to be launching a crypto game called PokéWorld (thanks, Vooks). 


The company even claimed to have worked on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Home and Pokémon Sleep.

These ports were previously announced to be coming to Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console back in October 2021 as part of the series&#x27; 25th anniversary. However, since then, things have been quite quiet on this particular Lara Croft front. 


Feral Interactive has said, however, that the team is looking forward to &quot;sharing more&quot; news about these ports &quot;in the new year!&quot;

                              <span>As part of the ongoing palaver between Microsoft and the FTC, the platform holder has revealed three upcoming Bethesda games will be exclusive to Xbox and PC.

This information comes as part of Microsoft&#x27;s response to the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s lawsuit against its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard (something it called &quot;unconstitutional&quot;). 


Tucked away in the newly issued document&#x27;s many, many pages, Microsoft stated: &quot;Xbox anticipates that three future titles - REDACTED - all of which are designed to be played primarily alone or in small groups - will be exclusive to Xbox and PCs.&quot;

                              <span>When Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 (2022) released back in October, players noticed that one multiplayer map available in the beta was conspicuously missing from the final game. Indeed, it was something I reported on during release. 


Now almost two months on, players fear the Valderas Museum will never return. Season One saw the return of fan favourite maps Shoothouse and Shipment, but players criticised the paltry number of maps released. One wonders why Infinity Ward hasn&#x27;t released a map that is seemingly complete and ready to ship. 


But players have taken it upon themselves to answer this question. Some have noticed the map&#x27;s striking resemblance to the real-life Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

                              <span>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Meta Quest VR headsets, has agreed to pay $725m to settle a class-action lawsuit which accused the company of allowing Cambridge Analytica to access personal user data without consent. 


The Cambridge Analytica scandal goes all the way back to 2018, when former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie disclosed to The Guardian and The New York Times that the UK-based company had scraped extensive data from Facebook without the explicit consent of users. 


The scandal led to investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and the UK&#x27;s Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office issuing a £500,000 fine to Facebook (this was before the GDPR had come into force, which allows for significantly higher financial penalties) and the US&#x27; Federal Trade Commission issuing a $5bn fine.

The game&#x27;s Steam page is now up and running.


The Division 2 launches on Steam nearly four years after it came out on PC and console in March 2019. Back then, Ubisoft&#x27;s deal with Epic meant the PC versions of its games launched on the Epic Games Store as well as Ubisoft&#x27;s own storefront, but not Steam, much to the annoyance of PC gamers.

                              <span>Following Putin&#x27;s barbaric invasion of Ukraine 10 months ago, Sherlock Holmes developer Frogwares has shared an update on life in the country amid the ongoing war.

Please note, some points in the article below are a tough read. Please continue at your own discretion.


In a poignant Twitter thread, Frogwares detailed the challenges the team has faced over the last few months, stating a &quot;wave of missile and suicide drone strikes that started in October have taken quite a toll on us mentally&quot;.

                              <span>The Gran Turismo series has sold over 90m copies, developer Polyphony Digital has announced.


That eye-watering figure came from Polyphony Digital CEO Kazunori Yamauchi as part of a message to fans to celebrate 25 years of the racing sim.


While Sony hasn&#x27;t announced it as such, Gran Turismo is PlayStation&#x27;s best-selling franchise. Much of that has to do with its longevity - there has been a Gran Turismo game on every PlayStation home console ever released.

                              <span>The wonderful Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge just got a free update that adds CRT (normal or curved) and VCR filters.


This nostalgia-fuelled update makes the brawler just that little bit more old-school Saturday morning cartoon. Here&#x27;s how it looks:


Also of note from the update is the addition of dip switches, a throwback to arcade machines whose dip switches let operators adjust game difficult (and rinse your pocket money in the process).

                              <span>The PlayStation Plus Essential January 2023 monthly games have leaked via the ever reliable Billbil-kun from DealLabs.


The headline here is the addition of Respawn&#x27;s Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, which came out in November 2019 and is set to get a sequel, Jedi Survivor, in March. The addition of Fallen Order to PS Plus Essential next month is well-timed in that context.


Elsewhere, Bethesda&#x27;s online-focused RPG Fallout 76 joins PS Plus Essential next month (it&#x27;s already in the PlayStation Plus Extra tier). Just yesterday we reported on how Fallout 76 has an impressive 13.5m players four years after its disastrous launch. I imagine joining PS Plus Essential will only fuel the player count.

                              <span>Blizzard has issued a World of Warcraft roadmap spanning an entire year.


In a move welcomed by fans of the 18-year-old massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Blizzard told players what to expect throughout 2023 and the road ahead for recently-released expansion Dragonflight.


Six content updates are set to go live throughout 2023, Blizzard said in a blog post, the first of which is right around the corner and adds the recently-announced Trading Post, new transmog options for grey and white gear, and additional world content.

That&#x27;s according to series creator and showrunner Lauren Hissrich. Talking to EW, Hissrich reflected on Cavill&#x27;s time on the show, saying the team wanted to &quot;honour that appropriately&quot;.


According to Hissrich, season three of The Witcher has taken inspiration from author Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s fourth book, Time of Contempt.

So how did they conduct themselves outside of the gaming bubble? With abuse and unintelligence of course. 


According to the CMA, it received approximately 2600 emails, around 500 of which &quot;contained abusive content (with no other substantive content), or were blank, unintelligible, stated to be from non-UK consumers, or not in English&quot;.

While the game will remain playable and rankings will continue without the use of prize pass levels, no new characters or maps will be released, effectively ending support following the conclusion of Season 5.


Meanwhile, sales of mythril, Chocobo GP&#x27;s premium currency, have been discontinued. The in-game mythril shop will disappear on 6th January. All purchased mythril becomes &quot;invalid&quot; then, too. Square Enix said it will not issue refunds for purchased mythril.

Like EternalBlue, CVE-2022-37958, as the latest vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to execute malicious code with no authentication required. Also, like EternalBlue, it’s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required...</span>

Kubernetes v1.26 introduced generally available (GA) support for kubelet credential
provider plugins,
offering an extensible plugin framework to dynamically fetch credentials
for any container image registry.
Background
Kubernetes supports the ability to dynamically fetch credentials for a container registry service.
Prior to Kubernetes v1.20, this capability was compiled into the kubelet and only available for
Amazon Elastic Container Registry, Azure Container Registry, and Google Cloud Container Registry.

                              <span>Continuing on with its season of giving, Epic Games Store is offering users the chance to get their hands on Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey for free right now. 


This diorama puzzler from developer Light Brick Studio is yours to claim until tomorrow (22nd December) at 4pm. After that, Epic will unveil its next mystery giveaway.


I have personally never played Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey, although it sounds right up my street. Our own Christian Donlan was quite enamoured with Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey&#x27;s breezy, tactile charms when he played through it, calling it &quot;the perfect holiday treat&quot; in his write up.

                              <span>Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 developer Raven Software has announced that the fan-favourite Loadout Drop has returned. 


Previously a legacy feature of the original Warzone, a Loadout Drop let players and their squad use custom-made loadouts rather than the weapons scavenged in the battle royale. 


While Loadout Drops would randomly spawn in the game world, buying a Loadout Drop grenade from a Buy Station would let you request a drop on demand.

                              <span>More snippets of information about Star Wars Jedi Survivor are steadily being released, with the most recent of these shedding more light on combat, traversal, and a new face for the series. 


Speaking to Game Informer, director Stig Asmussen stated players will discover &quot;five fully realised stances in the game&quot; for protagonist Cal Kestis, including a dedicated dual blade option and Kylo Ren-esque crossguard-style lightsaber (both of which were glimpsed in the most recent gameplay trailer, which you can see below).


As you may already have assumed, Asmussen said it will be &quot;advantageous to use certain types of stances against certain types of enemies&quot;. This, the director says, will require the player to &quot;break down the enemies and figure out what the best weapon of choice is&quot;.

The two faced each other while playing for their respective national teams in the World Cup final on Sunday, with the result securing Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time. But it also brought on a headache for the young Mbappe who scored a hat-trick in the match. 


Now the two will fly back to Paris to play together once again, and some have wondered what the changing room talk might be like.

                              <span>Atari is in a spot of bother, and has signalled it may need extra cash to continue.

Reporting its half year results to 30th September 2022, the Paris-based company admitted any delays in the development of its four activities (gaming, hardware, licensing and blockchain), or underperformance in its initiatives may cause it to make less money than expected, and in turn spark &quot;a liquidity shortfall and additional financing requirements&quot;.


There&#x27;s an &quot;uncertain macro-environment&quot; for video games and blockchain, the latter of which Atari has gone in heavily on, and so the company reckons actually implementing its new strategy &quot;may require additional funding resources&quot;.

The trailer in question (which I have seen) introduced an NPC known as Shaun. It was a playful set up that showed Shaun being interviewed about his work on Goat Simulator 3. 


Here he boasted about his impressive rag-dolling skills (he went to the &quot;most prestigious rag-dolling school in the world&quot;, you see), and reflected that sometimes he just sits on a bench and ponders the world at large. All in all, some fairly inoffensive stuff.

The now-deleted Tweets included a video of Ferdinand discussing the upcoming Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid, with the accompanying next: &quot;Here&#x27;s who I think will be taking home the [trophy emoji] … Class Day down at #PlayStationHouse ahead of the #UCLFinalv … @PlayStation #PlayStationPartner.&quot;

                              <span>Sony has revealed further details of its new DualSense Edge wireless controller for the PlayStation 5, but one particular point stuck out the most. 


In a hand-on preview, The Verge noticed that battery life was noticeably worse than the base DualSense controller, and this was later confirmed to the publication in a statement. 


&quot;The DualSense Edge wireless controller&#x27;s operating time is moderately shorter than the original DualSense wireless controller,&quot; a Sony spokesperson said. &quot;We wanted to strike a good balance between wireless operating time and delivering robust, high-performance features.&quot;

This version of the game will include a new Arenas mode, which will also arrive as a free update for PC via the Epic Games Store and on PlayStation at the same time.


Details of what this new offering will include are thin on the ground at the moment - a trailer for the update promises nine maps which will unlock new modifiers and alternate moves, additional cheats and fresh outfits. It sounds like they&#x27;ll be worth playing!

At least you can have fun with it, and that&#x27;s exactly what YouTuber and animator King Bob Gaming did, having recreated the entire trailer with Nintendo 64 graphics. 


The video is a near frame-by-frame recreation of the trailer, with authentic assets from Super Mario 64.

                              <span>The Witcher 3&#x27;s next-gen update on PC has received a hotfix to address a number of the issues that accompanied the launch. 


According to the patch notes, the hotfix should &quot;improve overall stability and performance of the game, and fix GOG &amp; Steam overlays.&quot; 


Stability and performance improvements is of course the catch-all phrase used by developers to group a large number of small fixes, but we do know from reports of PC users that problems included framerate drops and slow texture loading.

                              <span>Paw-don me, I didn&#x27;t mean to inter-ruff your day, but I have some news to share with you: Pupperazzi, and all the dogs that come with it, will be bounding onto the Nintendo Switch early next year. 


Sundae Month and publisher Kitfox Games announced this news as part of Nintendo&#x27;s House of Indies: Holiday Event yesterday, promising Switch owners that soon they will be able to use their photography skills to snap all the best shots of shibas, terriers, labs, pugs, and more. &quot;You want &#x27;em, WE GOT EM!&quot; the Pupperazzi team proclaimed.


But it is not just taking pictures. Along with getting nice photos of your canine compatriots, you will also be able to play fetch with them, dress them up in a variety of outfits, have a dance party (or should that be paw-ty) with them and &quot;terrorise them with vacuum cleaners&quot; (but would you really want to do that?). You can even see them in action at the skatepark - in fact, Pupperazzi&#x27;s entire world is populated with dogs, dogs and yet more dogs. You can see what I mean in the trailer below.

                              <span>Despite mixed reviews and launch day technical issues, foul-mouthed shooter High on Life has screamed to the top of Xbox Game Pass&#x27; most played list.


Squanch Games and Justin Roiland&#x27;s effort is now the most popular game in Microsoft&#x27;s subscription - in both its PC and console catalogues. 


On Xbox consoles, more people are playing High on Life through Game Pass than other popular titles such as Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, FIFA 22 and Rainbow Six Siege. Indeed, it is currently being played by more people than any first-party Microsoft release, including Minecraft, Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite and Sea of Thieves.

                              <span>A major new study from UK consumer group Which? has found evidence that the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s infamous Joy-Con drift is likely caused by a mechanical fault, pointing to fundamental design flaws.


The research found that the Joy-Con&#x27;s plastic circuit boards showed noticeable wear on the joystick slider contact points, despite only being used for months. It is this wear that ultimately results in drifting. 


In addition, dust and other contaminants were found in the Switch&#x27;s internal components, despite attempts by Nintendo at dustproofing said areas.

                              <span>Mandiant is reporting on a trojaned Windows installer that targets Ukrainian users. The installer was left on various torrent sites, presumably ensnaring people downloading pirated copies of the operating system:
Mandiant uncovered a socially engineered supply chain operation focused on Ukrainian government entities that leveraged trojanized ISO files masquerading as legitimate Windows 10 Operating System installers. The trojanized ISOs were hosted on Ukrainian- and Russian-language torrent file sharing sites. Upon installation of the compromised software, the malware gathers information on the compromised system and exfiltrates it. At a subset of victims, additional tools are deployed to enable further intelligence gathering. In some instances, we discovered additional payloads that were likely deployed following initial reconnaissance including the STOWAWAY, BEACON, and SPAREPART backdoors...</span>

In Kubernetes 1.26, the 1st alpha release of validating admission policies is
available!
Validating admission policies use the Common Expression
Language (CEL) to offer a declarative,
in-process alternative to validating admission
webhooks.
CEL was first introduced to Kubernetes for the Validation rules for
CustomResourceDefinitions.
This enhancement expands the use of CEL in Kubernetes to support a far wider
range of admission use cases.
Admission webhooks can be burdensome to develop and operate. Webhook developers
must implement and maintain a webhook binary to handle admission requests. Also,
admission webhooks are complex to operate. Each webhook must be deployed,
monitored and have a well defined upgrade and rollback plan. To make matte…</span>

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission has hit Fortnite maker Epic Games with a record-breaking penalty of $520m (£427m) over allegations it previously employed &quot;lax privacy practices&quot; for voice and text chat, and used design tricks to &quot;dupe millions of players&quot; into unintentional purchases. 


The eye-opening judgment includes the largest-ever settlement obtained by the FTC regarding the US Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act, as Fortnite allowed in-game chat and user data collection by default. 


Fortnite holds a &quot;Teen&quot; rating by the US ratings board ESRB, but the FTC has argued Epic Games knew many of its users were likely under 13 years of age and had not obtained their parents&#x27; consent.

                              <span>EA has used its FIFA series to correctly predict the winner of the World Cup for fourth consecutive time. 


The entire tournament was simulated inside FIFA 23, which outputted Argentina as the ultimate winners, with Lionel Messi winning the Golden Boot and Emi Martínez winning the Golden Glove awards. The predictions were published November 8th, long before the tournament had started. 


The game&#x27;s ability to predict the winner for the fourth time in a row is a testament to the accuracy of FIFA&#x27;s official rankings, but of course the uncertainty of the real world means that not everything was predicted correctly.

Square Enix states each of these remasters, which can be bought as a one stop bundle with all six games or individually, will offer improved gameplay, a &quot;modernised UI&quot; and other accoutrements such as &quot;a bestiary, illustration gallery and music player&quot;.

But it also brought with a whole host of bugs and glitches.

EA&#x27;s mega-successful football series is a frequent winner of the Christmas number one crown, and last week likely saw a further boost in sales due to the attention surrounding the controversial World Cup in Qatar.


FIFA games have now taken the Christmas top spot 10 times since sales records began back in 1984, making it the most popular Christmas number one franchise (versus Call of Duty&#x27;s nine Christmas chart toppers).

“Seeing the drone in the field of view, make eye contact with it,” the video instructs. Soldiers should then raise their arms and signal they’re ready to follow.
After that the drone will move up and down a few meters, before heading off at walking pace in the direction of the nearest representatives of Ukraine’s army, it says.

The Device Plugin framework was introduced in the Kubernetes v1.8 release as a vendor
independent framework to enable discovery, advertisement and allocation of external
devices without modifying core Kubernetes. The feature graduated to Beta in v1.10.
With the recent release of Kubernetes v1.26, Device Manager is now generally
available (GA).
Within the kubelet, the Device Manager facilitates communication with device plugins
using gRPC through Unix sockets. Device Manager and Device plugins both act as gRPC
servers and clients by serving and connecting to the exposed gRPC services respectively.
Device plugins serve a gRPC service that kubelet connects to for device discovery,
advertisement (as extended resources) and allocation. Device Manager connects to

                              <span>It looks like Microsoft is considering introducing cheaper, ad-supported tiers of its Xbox Game Pass.

That&#x27;s according to a survey Microsoft recently circulated to players, inviting views about the current Xbox Game Pass subscription and querying if we&#x27;d be willing to accept adverts if the subscription payment was lower.

An unsourced screenshot, written in Spanish and shared on ResetEra (via VGC), alleges that Microsoft is surveying players and exploring a tier-like system - similar to that of Ubisoft+ and Sony&#x27;s PS Plus - by inviting them to &quot;consider hypothetical subscriptions&quot;.

The episodic videos take you through collaboration with the team at Techland to rehearsals with the London Contemporary Orchestra to &quot;create an enthralling soundtrack&quot;.

Ubisoft has been pretty quiet about the game so far, and even the name remains under wraps for now. But that hasn&#x27;t stopped the studio from putting out a public call to players, inviting them to join the playtest team.

&quot;Be part of something great,&quot; the studio teases on its sign-up page. &quot;Nothing beats the feeling of being part of the creation of a completely new game.

Running from now until 19th December, you&#x27;ll be able to kick off your own Viking adventure on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and the Ubisoft Store. 

If you&#x27;ve yet to meet Eivor, you&#x27;ll get &quot;full main game content&quot; - so, the base game, without any subsequent DLC - and if you like it enough to stick around, your progression will carry over if you decide to purchase the game.

                              <span>Meta&#x27;s VR consulting CTO, John Carmack, is leaving the company after &quot;a decade in VR&quot;, accusing the firm of &quot;self-sabotage&quot;.

In an internal note seen by Business Insider, Carmack criticised the company&#x27;s &quot;efficiency&quot;, adding that despite Quest 2 being &quot;almost exactly what [he] wanted to see&quot; with its &quot;mobile hardware, inside out tracking, optional PC streaming, 4K(ish) software&quot;, he was &quot;offended&quot; at seeing a &quot;5 per cent GPU utilisation number in production&quot;.

&quot;We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort,&quot; Carmack - who co-created the Doom and Quake franchises - said in the leaked memo. &quot;There is no way to sugarcoat this; I think our organisation is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy.

                              <span>Playtest footage reportedly taken from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Jade has leaked online.

Allegedly posted to an Assassin&#x27;s Creed Facebook page and then, in turn, shared with Assassin&#x27;s Creed and Gaming Leaks and Rumours on Reddit, the footage - which runs for 2.40 mins - was seemingly captured on an Apple mobile device and depicts a combat-heavy sequence, which includes cut-scenes and combat tutorials. You can watch it here. 

Whilst it&#x27;s not the first we&#x27;ve seen of Jade - Ubisoft dropped a polished teaser earlier this year - it is the first time we&#x27;ve seen raw footage like this (thanks, TheGamer). As always, you can&#x27;t necessarily expect the final product to look and/or play this way - this is likely a very, very early version of the game - and, as always, if you&#x27;re interested, you should probably check it out sooner rather than later: these things have a habit of disappearing within a day or two.

                              <span>Double Fine boss Tim Schafer has revealed he avoids &quot;a grab bag of stereotypes&quot; to make his games more inclusive and avoid &quot;hurting people&quot;.

In an interview with NME, Schafer revealed that when he started making games back in the &#x27;80s, there was &quot;a lot less sensitivity&quot; around, but between developing 2005&#x27;s Psychonauts and its 2021 sequel, he&#x27;d &quot;learned a lot&quot; and was &quot;thinking about how [his] art will be interpreted by the viewer&quot;.

&quot;I thought I&#x27;d learned a lot, and then we tested a game, and people pointed out a word and asked if we knew what this word means to certain people,&quot; the Schafer said. &quot;I had no idea – and people will criticise that and say &#x27;woke culture, PC police&#x27; and stuff – but for any art, I&#x27;m thinking about how my art will be interpreted by the viewer.

                              <span>Five long-serving senior team members at Need for Speed developer Criterion have departed the studio following the launch of Need for Speed Unbound last month.


As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion&#x27;s vice president and general manager Matt Webster has left the studio after 23 years, as has head of studio development and 17-year Criterion veteran Alan McDairmant.


They&#x27;re joined by senior technical director Andrei Shires, who has been with the company for 16 years, as well as executive producer Pete Lake, who first joined Criterion in 1996. Head of content Steve Uphill also leaves following his most recent 10-year stint at Criterion. All are said to have left the developer to &quot;explore new opportunities outside of EA&quot;.

                              <span>Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla Games has confirmed a new co-op-focused online Horizon project is currently in the works at the studio.


Reports of a co-op component for the Horizon series first emerged in 2020, when VGC claimed the studio had initially been looking to implement the feature as part of 2017&#x27;s Horizon Zero Dawn before ditching it to focus on other areas. Co-op was then said to have been revived for Horizon Forbidden West, potentially as a separate mode, but again didn&#x27;t make the final cut.


As confirmed by Guerilla&#x27;s recruitment-focused Twitter feed, however, the studio&#x27;s co-op dreams are still very much alive, with the company currently hiring for an internally developed &quot;separate online project&quot; in the Horizon universe. This will feature a &quot;new cast of characters and a unique stylised look&quot;, and allow friends to &quot;explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together&quot;.

                              <span>High On Life creator Justin Roiland has revealed the game features AI-generated art and voice acting.
The topic of AI generation has increasingly become a hot discussion, with arguments arising over its use and the implications it has ethically, artistically, and technologically. 
In an interview with Sky News, Roiland talked about the use of AI in the development of High On Life.

                              <span>Elden Ring has absolutely dominated the news this year, so much so I&#x27;ve ended up writing 100 news pieces on it alone.


Well, 99 actually. So writing one more in celebration of the best Elden Ring news stories of the year seemed like a fitting way to hit that hundred.


And so below is my ranked list of top 20 favourites. Before that, a big thanks to the rest of the team too for their superb coverage in news, guides, videos, and Aoife&#x27;s Essential review.

Available now on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, the update weighs in at around 11-13GB and also adds &quot;combat improvements... localisation optimisations and general quality of life changes&quot;. 


A specific fix has been made for an issue on PS4, where the game&#x27;s Trophies were not syncing. This has now been addressed.

                              <span>Valve is unlikely to soup up the graphical prowess of its Steam Deck in time for the PC gaming handheld&#x27;s second generation, the company has indicated. 


Instead, the next version of Steam Deck is far more likely to see hardware improvements centered around its screen and battery capacity. 


Speaking to The Verge, Steam Deck engineers suggested Valve was keen to stick with one singal performance point for the handheld for the time being - it&#x27;s simple to understand Steam Deck verified status - to avoid muddying the waters.

But another Easter egg discovered by players isn&#x27;t as easy to solve as those.

Some had speculated (hoped?) Cavill would reprise his much-loved role as Geralt after Warner Bros. ditched him as Superman.


In October, Netflix announced The Witcher Season 4 and Cavill&#x27;s exit from the show.

The match-three game was the Mega Drive&#x27;s answer to Tetris, with coloured gems falling from the top of the screen to iconic music. I played the hell out of this as part of the Mega Games One compilation. 


The other games joining are Golden Axe 2, Alien Storm, and Virtua Fighter 2. See them in action in the trailer below.

                              <span>Spare a thought for poor old Henry Cavill: once wearer of the gangly locks as Geralt of Rivia, once bearer of the bulgy bits as Superman, now no longer either. But on the bright side, his lovely dog&#x27;s now in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, courtesy of its new-gen update.


Henry Cavill&#x27;s dog, an American Akita named Kal, is a bit of a star in his own right, frequently snapped alongside the actor and apparently a bit of a fixture on-set of Cavill&#x27;s projects. During filming of The Witcher, for instance, Kal was said to have been on location the &quot;entire time&quot;. 


And now Kal has been immortalised in digital form, appearing at the Devil&#x27;s Pit for players that get the &quot;good&quot; ending in The Witcher 3&#x27;s new quest In The Eternal Fire&#x27;s Shadow, introduced as part of CD Projekt&#x27;s long-in-the-works new-gen update.

                              <span>Six years after announcing his departure from Blizzard Entertainment, and his retirement from the games industry at large, long-serving Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen is returning to the company as creative advisor on the Warcraft franchise.


Metzen&#x27;s retirement from Blizzard in 2016 came as a shock to many a fan. He&#x27;d been with the company for 23 years at that point, serving as head writer and lore guru (or, more officially, senior vice president of story and franchise development) and had become one of its most recognisable faces across countless BlizzCons.


&quot;The reason I use the word &#x27;retire&#x27;&quot;, Metzen explained in a statement at the time of his departure, &quot;is because I&#x27;m not going to some other company or starting up new projects or anything remotely like that. It&#x27;s been a long, amazing stretch of years. Now it&#x27;s time to slow it down. Rest. Lay around on the couch and get fat.&quot;

                              <span>Hideo Kojima&#x27;s idiosyncratic post-apocalyptic courier adventure Death Stranding is the latest in an increasingly long line of video games to get the movie treatment, courtesy of a newly announced collaboration between Kojima Productions and Barbarian executive producer Alex Lebovici&#x27;s Hammerstone Studios.


Death Stranding, for those unfamiliar, stars The Walking Dead&#x27;s Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier trying to make ends meet in an aggressively wet corner of rural Wales. One day, his clothes unexpectedly fall off, a baby turns into goo, ...fish?! Then, walking!!!!


Okay, so that&#x27;s not exactly how it goes (although it&#x27;s not not, either) but it&#x27;s fair to say Death Stranding&#x27;s atmospheric tale of a post-apocalyptic United States - which, yes, does look at awful lot like Wales - is not short of wonderfully outlandish ideas. There are eerily invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, a mysterious plane of existence known as the Beach, and much, much more.

                              <span>Insomniac has confirmed Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, the eagerly awaited sequel to 2018&#x27;s acclaimed open-world swing-em-up - will arrive on PS5 next &quot;fall&quot;.


That&#x27;s not, admittedly, anywhere close to being an actual launch date, but at least fans can now update their diaries and keep their anticipation in check. And the not particularly specific announcement may have something to do with the fact the &quot;fall 2023&quot; release was leaked earlier this week after a writer on the project added the date (since removed) to their online CV.


Official confirmation, however, has now arrived courtesy of a new post to the PlayStation Blog. &quot;What a year it&#x27;s been for PlayStation Studios,&quot; Spider-Man 2 creative director Bryan Intihar wrote as part of the news, &quot;here at Insomniac Games we’ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers. Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022...and here’s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.”

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in the mood for some entertainment that&#x27;s both fun and free, you might like to point your browser in the direction of No Man&#x27;s Sky studio Hello Games, which has just made the two mobile instalments of its very excellent arcade stunt racer series Joe Danger playable on the web for the grand total of zero pee.


More specifically, those with a hankering for some stuntery and a browser within arms reach can test their racing mettle in Joe Danger Touch and its follow-up Joe Danger Infinity, which were initially released on iOS in 2013 and 2014.


Both games, you might recall, unceremoniously vanished from the App Store in 2017, following Apple&#x27;s decision to end support for 32-bit apps with iOS11. But in a lovely moment at the start of this year, they each received a surprise re-release. &quot;It&#x27;s always been a secret shame of ours that the success of No Man&#x27;s Sky left Joe Danger unloved,&quot; Hello Games&#x27; Sean Murray explained at the time. &quot;For the last two years we&#x27;ve had a hobby project of bringing Joe Danger back to life. Slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of Unity changes.&quot;

                              <span>Earlier this year, it was announced that the next game in the Tomb Raider series was in development. 


While details about this upcoming release are still thin on the ground, with even its name still remaining a mystery, today Amazon Games announced it will be working alongside developer Crystal Dynamics on the project. 


Amazon will provide its &quot;full support&quot; to the team at Crystal Dynamics to bring this next Tomb Raider game to life, the company said today. On the game&#x27;s release, Amazon Games will also act as its publisher.

                              <span>There may be no more new characters for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (and series creator Masahiro Sakurai can finally take a bit of a break), but that doesn&#x27;t mean the series is quite finished yet.

For fans looking to complete their amiibo collection, there&#x27;s now an official release date for Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s Sephiroth and Tekken&#x27;s Kazuya Mishima.
Minecraft&#x27;s Steve and Alex were the most recent amiibo to be released, after they were delayed to September earlier this year.

                              <span>A quick PSA for those keen to try out some of Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer offerings but who don&#x27;t fancy splashing their cash on the full game: its free access period begins today.


This free access will run until 19th December, and offers three maps and four modes to play through.


The maps in question are Shipment (a new arrival to the game - more on that in a second), Farm 18 (which is a Shoothouse inspired number) and El Asilo. Meanwhile, the four modes are Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed. These can be played in first and third-person.

                              <span>Starfield&#x27;s lead quest designer Will Shen has divulged more about the upcoming game&#x27;s faction quests and the players&#x27; companion side-kicks. 


In a new video, Shen revealed Starfield&#x27;s faction quests will be more similar to those from Bethesda&#x27;s Skyrim, in the sense that players will be able to experience each faction independently. This will not be a Fallout 4 situation, which saw players being locked out of factions after joining another (something that was a bone of contention among some members of the community).


&quot;One of the early things we decided on was making sure that the main quest actually kind of gives you a little bit of a tour of the settled systems and all of the major players there so that we can give you a taste of what they&#x27;re going to be up to,&quot; Shen explained.

Roach is Geralt&#x27;s trusty steed but until now she&#x27;s only been rideable, despite the strong bond players form with her over the hours and hours of playtime. 


Now, thanks to the recent upgrade patch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, Roach can be given the love and affection she deserves.

                              <span>Security researchers found a software bug in the KmsdBot cryptomining botnet:
With no error-checking built in, sending KmsdBot a malformed command­—like its controllers did one day while Akamai was watching­—created a panic crash with an “index out of range” error. Because there’s no persistence, the bot stays down, and malicious agents would need to reinfect a machine and rebuild the bot’s functions. It is, as Akamai notes, “a nice story” and “a strong example of the fickle nature of technology.”

                              <span>Last week, I hosted a two-day workshop on reimagining democracy.
The idea was to bring together people from a variety of disciplines who are all thinking about different aspects of democracy, less from a “what we need to do today” perspective and more from a blue-sky future perspective. My remit to the participants was this:
The idea is to start from scratch, to pretend we’re forming a new country and don’t have any precedent to deal with. And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent. The twenty-first century is a very different place technically, scientifically, and philosophically. What could democracy look like if it were reinvented today? Would it even be democracy­—what comes after democracy?...</span>

Dynamic resource allocation is a new API for requesting resources. It is a
generalization of the persistent volumes API for generic resources, making it possible to:
access the same resource instance in different pods and containers,
attach arbitrary constraints to a resource request to get the exact resource
you are looking for,
initialize a resource according to parameters provided by the user.
Third-party resource drivers are responsible for interpreting these parameters
as well as tracking and allocating resources as requests come in.
Dynamic resource allocation is an alpha feature and only enabled when the
DynamicResourceAllocation feature
gate and the
resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group are enabled. For details, see the
--feature-gat…</span>

As was the case for previous Mega Man Legacy Collections, Capcom&#x27;s Battle Network compilation - which gathers together 10 games in the real-time tactical RPG spin-off series - will be split across two volumes for its digital release. 


Volume 1 features Mega Man Battle Network, Mega Man Battle Network 2, Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue, and Mega Man Battle Network 3 White - all of which originally launched for Nintendo GBA between 2001 and 2003.

                              <span>Following reports earlier this year that Amazon was eyeing up a live-action TV adaptation of Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War series, the project is now officially go for Prime Video.


According to The Hollywood Reporter, the show has been in development since March and will, notably, focus on Kratos&#x27; dad years in Midgard as per 2018&#x27;s God of War reboot, rather than the ultra-violent Greek-mythology-inspired adventures of Kratos&#x27; earlier games.


Here&#x27;s how the show&#x27;s official description teases its plot: &quot;When his beloved wife dies, Kratos sets off on a dangerous journey with his estranged son to spread her ashes from the highest peak - his wife&#x27;s final wish. Kratos soon realises the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new gods and monsters for the fate of the world.&quot;

                              <span>The paladin class is coming to the early access version of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. It&#x27;s the headline addition in Patch 9 which, I&#x27;m afraid, sounds like it will be the last major content update to the early access build before the game&#x27;s full release in August 2023.
Larian leader Swen Vinke said this during a patch pre-briefing a week ago, telling press - myself included - they&#x27;d now like to concentrate on finishing the game, which is fair enough.
No release date for Patch 9 has been communicated.

In a post announcing the news, Epic described the services and servers it&#x27;s pulling as &quot;out-of-date&quot;, and said it was making the move as it transitions to exclusively support its Epic Online Services &quot;with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features&quot;.

Announced as part of Private Division&#x27;s fifth anniversary celebrations, the new project is said to be in &quot;early development&quot; for unnamed platforms. Further details are scant to the point of non-existent, but Bloober has confirmed we won&#x27;t be seeing the fruits of its efforts for quite some time, with a launch not expected before 2025.


In a statement accompany today&#x27;s announcement, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno referred to the unnamed project only as an &quot;exciting new survival horror game&quot;, saying it &quot;will help us become a leader in the horror industry at large&quot;.

Throughout the day, users have been taking to social media and to Steam&#x27;s review section to make their feelings clear about the game&#x27;s performance on their PC setups. Overall, the suggestion is the game is punishing on CPUs - even high-end ones - if you have ray-tracing switched on.


Some users have said they&#x27;ve since used Steam&#x27;s roll-back functionality to remove the update entirely.

                              <span>Last week, we got the news that none other than Idris Elba would be part of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion. This news was, for many of us, a very welcome surprise. 


However, Hungarian digital artist Zsolt Kosa actually envisioned this collaboration much, much, earlier. Perhaps, even before developer CD Projekt Red did. 


Two years ago, Kosa shared two mocked up posters of Elba in Cyberpunk 2077 to his ArtStation page. The first of these shows Elba with ice blue cyber-eyes and an impressively collared coat (as shown in this article&#x27;s header image). The second shows him with some rather fancy looking sunglasses, and that same very fetching coat.

This the second Mushroom Kingdom theme park area to open globally, following the first&#x27;s opening at Universal Studios in Japan in 2021. 


The two will share a number of similar attractions, including an AR Mario Kart-themed ride, a Mario-themed cafe and exclusive merchandise. But the US version will lack its big Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure ride - cut, it was previously reported, due to size issues.

The expansion pack sold 1m copies in July, just a week after it released. As we&#x27;ve previously reported, by 2020 the base game sold 6m copies, so it looks like the DLC is selling extremely well to its fans.

Ed loved The Delicious Last Course when he dug into it at release, which delivered on the recipe of success nailed by the original.

The patch adds ray-traced reflections when playing using the game&#x27;s 30fps Fidelity Mode, allowing for details such as vehicles and characters to be shown on reflective surfaces such as windows and in water. 


Fly a helicopter past a skyscraper and you&#x27;ll now see your ride reflected in its glass. Zoom along Los Santos&#x27; neon-drenched waterfront in your jet ski, and you&#x27;ll be able to see its lights reflected in the waves. Neat!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve all done it before. You need a picture for an assignment or presentation, you head to Google and find the perfect image. But it&#x27;s got a huge watermark across it. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s being used for profit, or it&#x27;s going to be seen by thousands of people, so it&#x27;s probably fine.
The stakes are a little different when said assignment is, say, a £50 game from a best-selling, worldwide franchise. And unfortunately for someone at Square Enix, that assignment was Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion.
Shortly after the game&#x27;s release yesterday, the eagle-eyed writers over at Kotaku noticed a Getty Images watermark on one of the in-game paintings.

However, one PlayStation 1 game that many have dabbled with since its release on PlayStation Plus is Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue, the tie-in game for Pixar and Disney&#x27;s 1999 animation film.  

In fact, this game is actually third on Sony&#x27;s most played classic games for 2022, sitting only behind Mafia: Definitive Edition and God of War 3 Remastered. This makes it the most played PlayStation Plus PS1 game of 2022.

A long reddit thread of experiences from players writing on r/Games lists numerous experiences of frame-rate issues and long load times even on high-end PC setups - only to see them improved without the 2K Launcher active. 


Bypassing the launcher is not as simple as hitting uninstall - 2K clearly wants you to run its software as part of the game&#x27;s startup. Still, the thread has a point-by-point list of instructions for those who do want to give it a go.

Yes, you can now play games on Steam on a Tesla. Not just Cuphead and Sonic, but also Cyberpunk 2077! And Elden Ring (with a build that doesn&#x27;t make any sense)!

                              <span>Spider-Man from Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man will appear in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. 


Yep, you read that right. The Yuri Lowenthal-voiced Spidey from Insomniac&#x27;s PlayStation game series will be part of the upcoming animated multiverse movie.


Insomniac&#x27;s Spidey incarnation can be briefly seen in Across the Spider-Verse&#x27;s latest trailer - although it is unclear how much of a role the character will play in the final film.

                              <span>Most of us have probably settled in quite comfortably to Mario Kart 8 by now. After all, it has been out for almost nine years on the Wii U, while the Switch&#x27;s Deluxe edition has been around since 2017. 


However, Nintendo&#x27;s most recent Mario Kart update does not address MK8. Rather, it&#x27;s for its predecessor - the 3DS&#x27;s Mario Kart 7.


This update - or, to give it its official name, the version 1.2 update - is the first update that this game has received in a little over 10 years. Here are the full notes from Nintendo - &quot;Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Unknown Worlds&#x27; superb underwater survival adventure Subnautica has just received its first major update in two years, bringing with it new building bits, performance enhancements, accessibility features, quality of life improvements, and over 800 bug fixes.


Unknown Worlds&#x27; latest update - officially titled Living Large, or 2.0 to its friends - is described as a &quot;labour of love for the entire Subnautica team&quot;, and aims to address &quot;a tonne of tech debt and [bring] across some improved code from Below Zero.&quot;


To that end, Living Large moves Subnautica and its follow-up Below Zero onto unified versions of Unity, enabling the developer to implement quality of life features, fix bugs, and performance improvements in Subnautica that were already available in the more recent game.

                              <span>You know what really grinds my gears? Well, lots of things, but in this case, let’s talk about multi-cloud. Not my typical rant about multi-cloud not ever being a good best practice—because it’s not—but rather how companies talk about multi-cloud. HashiCorp just did a whole survey on how multi-cloud is the future, and at no point during that entire process did they define the term.

                              <span>As Ubisoft&#x27;s preferential treatment for the Epic Games Store continues to evaporate, yet another of the publisher&#x27;s titles is making its way to Steam, with the reasonably well-recieved Watch Dogs Legion now pencilled in for a 23rd January release on Valve&#x27;s platform.


This latest listings follows Ubisoft&#x27;s announcement back in November that, having skipped Steam in favour of Epic and its own Ubisoft Connect since 2019, it would soon be bringing a select number of its games to Valve&#x27;s storefront, starting with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800, and the free-to-play Roller Champions.


That initial line-up expanded by one last week with Immortals Fenyx Rising, and now Watch Dogs Legion&#x27;s official January release brings Ubisoft&#x27;s post-2019 Steam selection up to five.

                              <span>Two Point Studios has lifted the festive pudding&#x27;s lid off its free winter update for spoof school strategy game Two Point Campus.


This update will see players decking their halls with boughs of holly, thanks to a collection of new seasonal items that have been added to the game. This includes charming stockings, twinkling fairy lights, and even Santa&#x27;s very own sleigh (which comes complete with its own reindeer team).


Meanwhile, thanks to the new Christmas tree additions, you could even say you will now be able to spruce your campus up a bit. After all, these decorations are tree-mendous (ok, I&#x27;ll stop now).

                              <span>How safe do you feel in your Valheim base? Walls secure, trenches dug out, windows sealed? Even with all these precautions in place, you may still not be safe from Valheim&#x27;s new enemies. With the introduction of the Mistlands update comes a new type of raid - and this one is wreaking havoc on established player bases. Rather devastatingly, some players are losing homes that took them hundreds of hours to make. 


The new event, called &quot;they sought you out&quot;, unleashes hordes of insects on your player base - and worse still, they can fly. Seekers and seeker soldiers are capable of hopping over ditches, then mulching stone walls like they&#x27;re made of papier maché. The event can occur at any time after you&#x27;ve defeated the Plains boss Yagluth, so anyone who has completed Valheim&#x27;s biomes is vulnerable to these attacks. And sure enough, it&#x27;s taking a lot of players by surprise. 


&quot;When we got raided we got caught off-guard and lost our three-story base which took us hundreds of hours,&quot; said one Reddit user. &quot;It was protected with walls, trenches, and most upgraded gates - it didn&#x27;t slow the seekers down at all... We all rage quit after surviving the raid, but after looking around at the aftermath, we realised any amount of rebuilding wouldn&#x27;t matter because we lost seasonal item buffs for comfort level and we could not survive another raid like that.&quot;

The news was shared by Sega on its official Japanese website and Twitter account.

In comparison, total sales of the Sonic franchise over the previous financial year were 5.8m, meaning Sonic Frontiers has achieved almost half of that in one month. 2017&#x27;s well received Sonic Mania reached 1m sales in one year.

                              <span>Twitch has removed LGB Alliance from its list of approved charities following backlash from streamers and viewers.
On 7th December, Twitch announced it had added &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of new global charities to its charity tool for streamers. The feature was added in July in a US-only beta, and became available to all partners in August. Twitch and Paypal Giving Fund do not take a cut of donations raised through the charity tool.
&quot;We added tens of thousands more Paypal-vetted charities from the US and dozens of different countries,&quot; Twitch stated in its blog announcement. The company came under fire from users when they discovered LGB Alliance, a UK-based hate group opposed to trans rights, was one of the new additions to Twitch&#x27;s approved charities. The group was controversially granted charity status in April 2021 by the UK government.

Unlike other big PlayStation releases, it is recommended that you have a colossal 32GB of RAM available on your PC to play Returnal at its best potential. 


For comparison, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection and Horizon Zero Dawn both recommend having 16GB of RAM available - that is the minimum of what Returnal asks for. Meanwhile, God of War only asks for 8GB of RAM for the best PC experience.

                              <span>Microsoft reportedly offered Sony the option to add Call of Duty to its PlayStation Plus subscription service as part of its ongoing bid to acquire Activision Blizzard.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, who cited sources familiar with the negotiations between the two companies. This deal was allegedly made as part of Microsoft&#x27;s offer to Sony last month, which would see the Call of Duty series kept on PlayStation consoles for 10 years should the acquisition go through. 


Since Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard in a record-breaking deal worth $68.7bn, there have been concerns voiced about the presence of Call of Duty on other platforms.

As recorded on Armored Core 6&#x27;s Steam page, Miyazaki served as the game&#x27;s initial director, and Yamamura has now taken over that role.

Speaking to IGN, Miyazaki and Yamamura discussed some details of the game and addressed preconceptions people might have about it due to the game&#x27;s From Software has released over the past decade.

Write an essay in the style of Bruce Schneier on how ChatGPT will affect cybersecurity.
As with any new technology, the development and deployment of ChatGPT is likely to have a significant impact on the field of cybersecurity. In many ways, ChatGPT and other AI technologies hold great promise for improving the ability of organizations and individuals to defend against cyber threats. At the same time, however, the use of these technologies also raises important questions and concerns about the potential risks and challenges they may pose...</span>

                              <span>If you had hoped to take refuge in your newly acquired LA Thieves operator skin while playing Warzone 2.0, well here is your heads up - as part of the game&#x27;s Season 01 Reloaded update, it&#x27;s about to get a whole lot more visible. 

Once upon a time, this ensemble from Call of Duty eSports team LA Thieves basically allowed wearers to become one with the shadows thanks to its all-black design (bar a red embossed &quot;LA&quot; on the chest). However, it has now been given a colourful little update by Activision. So, yes, we will be able to see you now. 
As Ishraq reported earlier this month, this skin by LA Thieves was labelled  &quot;Roze 2.0&quot;, which is a reference to the Roze skin that was released for the original Warzone and Modern Warfare back in 2019. This skin was notoriously famous for making its wearer hard to see. In fact, following its release, Raven Software was forced to edit the skin to make it easier for other players to see the elusive Roze skin wearers.

                              <span>Just six months after its release, Nintendo looks like its putting Mario Strikers: Battle League on the sidelines.
The company announced the game&#x27;s next free update - wave 3 of additional content - will also be its last free update.
Previous DLC added Daisy, Shy Guy, Pauline, and Diddy Kong as playable characters, as well as new gear and stadiums. Watch the trailer for wave 3 below to see who&#x27;s been signed to the league next!

Directive 2022/2380, the amendment to existing EU regulation which will enforce the new charger rule, has now been published in the Official Journal of the EU, which reveals the deadline all phone manufacturers will have to comply by.

                              <span>Last week, it was The Game Awards. This annual event is a chance for developers and publishers to showcase their upcoming slate of games, with a smattering of awards in there as well.


However, following this year&#x27;s show, many couldn&#x27;t help but notice that Microsoft&#x27;s offerings seemed remarkably sparse. 


In fact, all we really got was a little &#x27;games here and games coming in 2023&#x27; teaser from the team, but nothing particularly firm. Despite this being the ideal opportunity to do so, we still have not had specific release dates announced for the likes of Starfield or Redfall - two of Xbox&#x27;s biggest upcoming exclusives.

This assurance comes from Naughty Dog&#x27;s own Neil Druckmann, who over the weekend told us not to worry as &quot;Ellie and Joel will grace the Steam Deck.&quot;



The Last of Us Part 1 remake was officially unveiled earlier this year after months of rumours. It made its way to the PlayStation 5 in September, and will make its PC debut on 3rd March next year. For those eager to get their hands on Joel and Ellie&#x27;s first story, the game is available to pre-purchase now via Steam and the Epic Games Store.

                              <span>The discourse around Days Gone continues.


Last week, former Days Gone director John Garvin controversially stated the reason the game didn&#x27;t receive universal acclaim was because of &quot;woke reviewers&quot; and reviewers who &quot;couldn&#x27;t be bothered to actually play the game&quot;. 

In addition to these unusual remarks, Garvin also threw the game&#x27;s programmers under the bus, blaming Days Gone&#x27;s &quot;tech issues&quot; such as &quot;bugs, streaming and frame rate&quot; for its middling reception.

                              <span>Digerati, publisher of The Outbound Ghost, has filed a lawsuit against its developer Conradical. 


Last week, lead developer Conrad Grindheim released a YouTube video explaining that his relationship with the publisher had &quot;dissolved&quot; and he was requesting the publisher return the publishing rights to him.



The dispute occurred due to Grindheim&#x27;s disappointment with the quality of the console release of the game, specifically on Switch. He allegedly vandalised the game&#x27;s store page on Steam in response, which has since been removed.

Apple says the only “major” categories not covered by Advanced Data Protection are iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendar because “of the need to interoperate with the global email, contacts, and calendar systems,” according to its press release...</span>

The Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG) Release is proud to announce that we
are digitally signing all release artifacts, and that this aspect of Kubernetes
has now reached beta.
Signing artifacts provides end users a chance to verify the integrity of the
downloaded resource. It allows to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks directly on
the client side and therefore ensures the trustfulness of the remote serving the
artifacts. The overall goal of out past work was to define the used tooling for
signing all Kubernetes related artifacts as well as providing a standard signing
process for related projects (for example for those in kubernetes-sigs).
We already signed all officially released container images (from Kubernetes v1.24 onwards).

                              <span>Goat Simulator 3&#x27;s Mandatory Holiday Update is now here.

The free update includes a host of &quot;festive goodies to ramp up that holiday spirit&quot;, including Santa hats, elf outfits, and &quot;weapons that shoot colourful lights&quot;. You can watch the brightly-coloured carnage in the teaser below:

Here to ensure that &quot;Ensure no NPC has a silent night&quot;, the game&#x27;s first content update since the sim released last month. As well as hats and outfits, you&#x27;ll also get Sack &amp; Sleigh - a feature that lets you pepper NPCs with wrapping paper and wrap them up - a lights machine gun with which you can place Christmas lights &quot;almost anywhere&quot;.

                              <span>The Witcher showrunner Lauren Hissrich has responded to The Witcher fans and insisted she has &quot;never mocked the books&quot; the video games and Netflix show is based upon.

The furor began when writer Beau DeMayo - who&#x27;s now working on X-Men &#x27;97 - says some of his colleagues in The Witcher&#x27;s writing room &quot;actively mocked&quot; the source material written by Andrzej Sapkowski.

&quot;I&#x27;ve been on show - namely Witcher - where some of the writers were not or actively disliked the books and games (even actively mocking the source material),&quot; DeMayo said in an interview back in October.

Conrad Grindheim - lead developer on The Outbound Ghost - took to YouTube to state that his relationship with his publisher, Digerati, had &quot;dissolved&quot; and wanted the publisher to return the publishing rights to him.

Stating that the indie title is &quot;not up to the quality standards of the games that I create and that you expect of me&quot;, he asked fans to avoid the game and said he was taking legal action to protect &quot;our company, our name, our reputation, and consumer&#x27;s rights&quot;.

Developed by MegaPixel Studio, The House of the Dead: Remake &quot;offers players around the world the joy to discover or rediscover this timeless arcade classic&quot; and is a &quot;state of the art remake&quot; complete with upgraded graphics, audio, and new game modes.

The Limidead Edition, as the name suggests, comes with a handful of additional goodies, too, including not only a copy of the game but an &quot;exclusive box with lenticular&quot; - which means it moves when you look at it from different angles - two cardboard character stands, and a sticker sheet.

The &quot;iconic&quot; Rundown 2.0 Infection is now available, reprising the inaugural Rundown that launched on the PC-only title way back in March 2020.

Not come across Rundowns before? They&#x27;re a snazzy name for what is essentially a regular game update that also ushers in new time-limited expeditions. Up until now, they&#x27;d always replaced the existing one, but now Rundown 2.0 Infection is the first of a &quot;planned rollout that will see every past GTFO Rundown since the game&#x27;s initial Early Access launch in December 2019 added back to the game&quot;.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 only released at the end of October, but it&#x27;s already the biggest-selling game of 2022 in the US.

Topping the November sales chart, that means Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has not only knocked Elden Ring off the coveted top spot, but it&#x27;s also resisted stiff competition from other games released last month, including God of War: Ragnarök and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. 

According to data from NPD and reported by VGC, that also makes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 the fastest-selling entry not just of the year, but of the franchise&#x27;s storied history, too, hitting $1bn in sales in just 10 days.

                              <span>Superb rhythm game Metal: Hellsinger has hit over a million players on PS5 and Xbox Series X and is now available on PS4 and Xbox One, too.

To celebrate, developer The Outsiders has &quot;new weapon skins to collect, combos to master, and Archdevil Mode to suffer&quot; the latter of which is an all new brutal difficulty level. There&#x27;s also a free digital artbook up for grabs, too.

The changes come courtesy of update 1.5, which as well as the usual bug fixes and QoL improvements, also invites players to &quot;rediscover each map in order to find Coats of Arms Collectibles&quot;.

                              <span>A Canadian court has approved a class-action lawsuit against the creators of Fortnite, Epic Games.

We first reported that the Canadian legal firm was preparing a class-action lawsuit against Epic Games back in 2019. It accused the developer of &quot;knowingly&quot; creating the &quot;very, very addictive game&quot;, Fortnite, but had been in limbo ever since as the court assessed whether or not the case could proceed.

Now, however, it seems the court agrees with the plaintiff that the claim &quot;does not appear to be frivolous or manifestly ill-founded&quot; and, according to CTV News, just because there&#x27;s &quot;no certainty&quot; that Epic created an &quot;addictive&quot; game it &quot;does not preclude the possibility that the game is in fact addictive and that its creator and distributor are presumed to know this&quot;.

Polygon reports that the lawsuit - filed in various countries right across the world, including the UK and Germany, due to varying copyright law - maintains free-to-play Hyper Front is &quot;a copy of substantial parts of Valorant&quot;, including its &quot;characters, maps, weapons, weapon skins, and charms&quot;.

Whilst player data for Hyper Front is currently unknown, Polygon points out that the Google Play Store says it has over a million downloads and almost 50,000 reviews. And whilst Hyper Front is currently unavailable in the US, where Riot is based, it is playable in many other territories where a mobile version of Valorant is currently in development and expected to release.

                              <span>This article talks about public land in the US that is completely surrounded by private land, which in some cases makes it inaccessible to the public. But there’s a hack:
Some hunters have long believed, however, that the publicly owned parcels on Elk Mountain can be legally reached using a practice called corner-crossing.
Corner-crossing can be visualized in terms of a checkerboard. Ever since the Westward Expansion, much of the Western United States has been divided into alternating squares of public and private land. Corner-crossers, like checker pieces, literally step from one public square to another in diagonal fashion, avoiding trespassing charges. The practice is neither legal nor illegal. Most states discourage it, but none ban it...</span>

This will be interesting to watch. If Eufy can ignore security researchers and the press without there being any repercussions in the market, others will follow suit. And we will lose public shaming as an incentive to improve security.</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s gradual tiptoe back onto Steam is set to continue, with the publisher&#x27;s enjoyable 2020 action-adventure Immortals Fenyx Rising now confirmed as heading to Valve&#x27;s platform.


Launched at the tail-end of 2020, Fenyx Rising followed the same pattern as all new Ubisoft PC releases since 2019, skipping Steam in favour of a dual launch on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store - where Epic was, perhaps not coincidentally, wooing publishers and developers with a 12% revenue cut compared to Valve&#x27;s 30%.


However, it appeared Ubisoft&#x27;s position on its preferred storefronts was about to shift in November after listings for a Steam version of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla were discovered, and the move was confirmed by the publisher itself in December, when Valhalla, Anno 1800, and Roller Champions were all announced to be heading to Valve&#x27;s platform.

                              <span>If your eyes are in need of something soothing after blinking your way through the night and this year&#x27;s Game Awards, then may I introduce you to Europa, an absolutely lovely looking new adventure from developer Helder Pinto.


Sporting a gorgeous Ghibli-esque art style, Europa promises a &quot;peaceful game of adventure, exploration, and meditation&quot; on terraformed moon in Jupiter&#x27;s shadow. Here, among lakes, meadows, mountains, and the remnants of a fallen civilisation, players - cast as an android called Zee - can run, glide, and fly across the landscape as they try to uncover the story of their creator.


Alongside an &quot;intimate story about growing up and humanity&#x27;s relationship with nature&quot;, Europa promises puzzles, secrets, and hidden dangers, with players able to gradually upgrade their Zephyr jetpack to boost higher and further.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, it&#x27;s the morning after the night before - and what a night. While The Game Awards 2022 dominated the news, Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover faced a major setback with the FTC and Diablo 4&#x27;s big release date announcement was superseded by serious claims of mismanagement and crunch.  

The awards ceremony was an eventful affair, even without its climactic and rather concerning stage invasion. The typical array of trailers for games like Final Fantasy 16, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and Street Fighter 6 came thick and fast, alongside big announcements for things such as Death Stranding 2, Hades 2, Horizon Forbidden West PS5-only DLC and Armored Core 6. 
Did Geoff Keighley keep his pledge to make this year&#x27;s ceremony speedier? Not really. Somewhere, Christopher Judge is now on the second day of his acceptance speech. So, here for you today is a recap of everything we thought was really worth your time - and what we think Death Stranding 2 should actually be titled. Joining me this week are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Wesley Yin-Poole.

                              <span>Developer Omega Force&#x27;s creature-battler Wild Hearts is inching ever closer to its February 2023 launch, and in the run-up to its release, the developer has introduced more of its behemoth targets in a new trailer.


Wild Hearts, a collaboration between Omega Force (the studio behind the long-running Warriors series) and EA Originals, transplants the creature battling formula most closely associated with Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter games to a fantastical feudal Japan.


This isn&#x27;t Omega Force&#x27;s first turn in the monster hunting genre, of course; it previously dabbled in its two Toukiden games, and Wild Hearts expands on those to introduce an experience where up to three players can seamlessly battle mysterious beasts known as Kemono.

The Deluxe Edition is one of three now available to pre-order via Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.net, as well as the slightly cheaper £80 Digital Deluxe Edition, and the £60 Standard Edition.


All pre-purchases get you access to the game and its open beta, plus a handful of extra cosmetics. The two pricier versions add extra cosmetic options and the game&#x27;s seasonal battle pass, with the Ultimate Edition upgrading that latter reward into its &quot;accelerated&quot; version.

                              <span>Last night, we got another look at the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, Phantom Liberty. This trailer, while only a little over a minute and a half long, gave us a few surprises. Namely, the debut of Idris Elba&#x27;s Solomon Reed. 


You can see it for yourself below.


So, yes, there is Elba in character (also, hey Keanu!). But just who exactly is that character? Let&#x27;s Idris the Elba in the room...

                              <span>Tekken 8 got its moment in the sun at The Game Awards last night, and for fans of the long-running fighting game franchise like me, one thing stood out: Jun Kazama&#x27;s return.


Jun Kazama, Jin&#x27;s mother, made her debut in 1995&#x27;s Tekken 2 and hasn&#x27;t been a playable character in the mainline Tekken series since. 27 years later, she&#x27;s back and it looks like she hasn&#x27;t aged a day. Tekken time logic, I guess.


The trailer below focuses on the Tekken 8 story (Tekken has an actual real life Guinness World Record for being the longest-running video game storyline!). Once again the Mishimas are at each other&#x27;s throats, with Tekken 8 picking up where Tekken 7 left off and the war between father and son Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama heating up. When all appears lost, Jin looks up and sees his mother&#x27;s dramatic return. I doubt there&#x27;s much interest in a family selfie.

                              <span>Brink and Gears Tactics developer Splash Damage is working on a new Transformers game for PC and consoles, which will launch in closed beta next year. 


Transformers: Reactivate was shown last night at The Game Awards 2022, with a fresh trailer you can see below. The project is being designed as an online action game for one to four players where you play as some of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters. And yes, you can transform between a vehicle and a bot (obviously!)


The news comes alongside word that Splash Damage has acquired Bulkhead, the UK studio behind World War 2 shooter Battalion 1944, which is also working on Transformers: Reactivate.

Earlier this year, Belarusian-based developer Sad Cat Studio announced it was delaying Replaced&#x27;s release into 2023 in light of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. 


&quot;The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families. As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced,&quot; the studio said in May.

                              <span>At last night&#x27;s Game Awards, a fairytale prequel for the Bayonetta series was announced called Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.



But there&#x27;s actually a playable teaser for the game hidden away in Bayonetta 3 - it&#x27;s been there all along since launch last month.


The teaser shows off the new childlike visuals and hints at the story, but until now it wasn&#x27;t clear what the hidden chapter related to.

                              <span>With a boom of a blessed bolter came gameplay of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 during The Game Awards last night, and while the heretical Eurogamer news team shrugged their shoulders, this loyal servant of the Emperor can confidently declare MUCH HYPE.


Saber Interactive&#x27;s hotly-anticipated (by me) sequel shows Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus stomp and shoot and generally smash to bits the xenos scum that is the Tyranids (they&#x27;re the evil aliens, Tom).


The setup here is pretty simple: the Tyranids are devouring worlds (nom nom) and it&#x27;s up to the Ultramarines to stem the tide. Cue big battles in which one man army Titus teaches the &#x27;nids a lesson in brutality.

The individual appeared to walk onto the stage alongside Elden Ring&#x27;s director Hidetaka Miyazaki and his entourage, and remained there while the esteemed developer gave his Game of the Year award acceptance speech. 


After being allowed to stay on stage apparently unnoticed for several minutes, the person then took to the microphone.

A first trailer for the game debuted tonight during 2022&#x27;s The Game Awards. It doesn&#x27;t give much away - or show proper gameplay - but here it is:

Here are all the announcements, trailers and news Geoff Keighley and co had to give the gaming world.
The Game Awards kicked off with a cinematic for Dead Cells DLC Return to Castlevania, which comes out Q1 2023. It&#x27;s a new Castelvania! Sort of.
We then got a short video for super popular roguelike shoot &#x27;em up Vampire Survivors on mobile. It&#x27;s out now!

Reeves, who will be reprising his role as Johnny Silverhand on the DLC&#x27;s release next year, will be joined by none other than Idris Elba.


Elba will be playing Solomon Reed, an &quot;FIA Agent for the New United States of America&quot;. His character will be pivotal to the expansion&#x27;s story. You can see both Reeves and Elba in the latest trailer for Phantom Liberty below.

&quot;Following a disastrous last mission, Antea is fatally wounded, becoming one of the spirits she loathes,&quot; teases Dontnod in its announcement, &quot;[and] the couple desperately searches for a way to liberate Antea from her new plight.&quot;

                              <span>Tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards 2022 ceremony included a fresh excerpt from the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie, showing Mario himself get used to travelling via warp pipes. 


As is befitting his outsider status in the Mushroom Kingdom, Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario has a rough ride in his first pipe, while being shown around by Keegan-Michael Key&#x27;s Toad. He&#x27;s also not that great at platforming yet, either.


I love the music in this clip - a nice reworking of some classic Mario melodies. The clip ends with Mario reaching Princess Peach&#x27;s Castle. Let&#x27;s watch:

                              <span>There had been rumours, but now it&#x27;s a sure thing. The upcoming DLC for Horizon Forbidden West is known as Burning Shores, and it will be coming to PlayStation 5 (sorry to say, it is not releasing on PS4) on 19th April. 


The trailer for Burning Shores shows Aloy heading to the ruins of Los Angeles. The city is &quot;overgrown and fractured&quot;, and Aloy will need to explore it by air on the back of a Sunwing, and via the water. You can see its announcement trailer below. 


Here is the official word on Burning Shores from Guerrilla Games:

The online free-to-play role-player was previously announced for an early spring 2023 launch in Japan. Amazon is handling publishing duties for its wider launch, due in the second half of the year. 


Blue Protocol is described as a sci-fi fantasy adventure set on the war-torn planet of Regnas, following thousands of years of non-stop conflict. It&#x27;s your job to restore balance, save the planet, and also explore its surface for side-quests and mini-games.

                              <span>Following a tease of a partnership earlier this year, Joe Madureira&#x27;s Airship Syndicate studio and Warfare developer Digital Extremes have unveiled the former&#x27;s new free-to-play online action-RPG, Wayfinder, coming to PC and consoles next year.


Set in the fractured fantasy world of Evenor, players take on the role of Wayfinders as they embark on a quest of &quot;endless action and adventure&quot; to restore their home from a foul, consuming force known as the Gloom.


Airship (which made Ruined King: A League of Legends Story and Darksiders Genesis) says each playable Wayfinder comes with its own unique story, play style, and abilities - which can be augmented by using Echoes from fallen foes - with players able to wield arcane magic, mystical tech, and &quot;cunning&quot; weapons as they embark on hunts and expeditions to new locations.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 finally has a release date! It&#x27;s only narrowed down to a month, rather than a day, but here it is: August 2023. Mark it in your calendars and take the whole month off. Say Eurogamer said it was okay.
The August 2023 release date means Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 arrives, in full, just shy of three years after it first appeared in Steam Early Access, in October 2022. A lot has happened there of course - a lot of tweaking and tuning and honing the experience of the game. Its popularity allowed Larian to breathe and make BG3 a bigger, better thing.
Just for giggles: the August 2023 date also means BG3 arrives 23 years after BG2, and 25 years after the original Baldur&#x27;s Gate. I imagine you&#x27;re probably not laughing if you remember those.

                              <span>After months of speculation, Death Stranding 2 has been officially announced at The Game Awards. 


This news follows a tease earlier today from creator Hideo Kojima, that showed a blanked out visage with the words &quot;How come?&quot; written across it. Many guessed this face was that of Léa Seydoux, and they were right as she is very much front and centre of Death Stranding 2&#x27;s (or DS2&#x27;s) announcement trailer, which you can see below. 


Joining Seydoux are actors Norman Reedus (who previously let slip that the game was in development), Troy Baker, Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna. The game will be coming to PlayStation 5.

The Last of Us Part 1 initially launched for PlayStation 5 back in September, giving Naughty Dog&#x27;s acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror a significant makeover - and a PC version has been promised for quite some time.


And now, as part of tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, Naughty Dog has slapped a PC release date on its celebrated remake, confirming it&#x27;ll be launching in March next year.

Conroy sadly passed away earlier this year after a battle with cancer. He voiced Batman for over 30 years, starting in the 90s with Fox Kids&#x27; Batman: The Animated series, which would go on to run for 85 episodes between 1992 and 1995.

Titled as Judas and set for launch at some point in the future on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, the game is the first to come from Levine&#x27;s studio Ghost Story Games since he shut down his former studio Irrational Games after shipping BioShock Infinite.

                              <span>Publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment has unveiled Hellboy Web of Wyrd, a new roguelite action-adventure based on Mike Mignola&#x27;s comic series that&#x27;s coming to Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.


&quot;Welcome to the Butterfly House,&quot; teases the official announcement, &quot;a mysterious manor of perverse angles and non-Euclidean geometry built by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux to open a gateway to the Wyrd, a vast, interdimensional web of wondrous and horrifying planes of existence beyond our world. When a B.P.R.D. agent vanishes inside the mansion, it’s up to Hellboy and his team of agents to uncover its forbidden secrets.&quot;


Specifics are a little thin right now, but Hellboy Web of Wyrd - which is being developed by West of Dead studio Upstream Arcade - promises an original storyline crafted in collaboration with series creator Mike Mignola, as well as designed to evoke the visuals and atmosphere of the comics. It also stars the always welcome Lance Reddick in the lead role.

It&#x27;s with immense joy that we announce the release of Kubernetes v1.26!
This release includes a total of 37 enhancements: eleven of them are graduating to Stable, ten are

Kubernetes 1.26: Electrifying

                              <span>A new investigation into Diablo 4&#x27;s development has painted a picture of chaos and mismanagement at Activision Blizzard, reportedly resulting in a dash to meet a release date - said to be 6th June next year - that staff believe is &quot;unlikely&quot; to be met without &quot;many hours of overtime or cut features&quot;.


In a new report by The Washington Post, assembled after speaking with 15 current and former Blizzard employees, it&#x27;s claimed Diablo 4&#x27;s development was troubled from the off, with leadership at the time instilling the project with a &quot;sense of inertia&quot; as large parts of the game were constantly revamped and scrapped - including a planned battle royale mode.


Talking to The Washington Post, team members laid much of the early blame at director Luis Barriga and lead designer Jesse McCree, both of who left the studio in 2021, amid serious allegations of institutionalised discrimination and harassment at Activision Blizzard. Colleagues claim, for instance, McCree &quot;would grow intrigued by different aspects of the game and then lose interest and hand it off to other people without finishing what he started.&quot;

&quot;We continue to believe that this deal will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers,&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s vice chair and president Brad Smith said in a statement. &quot;We have been committed since Day One to addressing competition concerns, including by offering earlier this week proposed concessions to the FTC.&quot;


&quot;While we believed in giving peace a chance,&quot; Smith concluded, &quot;we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court.”

There&#x27;s more too, but the replay editor is undoubtedly the star of the show, giving players the tools to turn their favourite takedowns into cinematic mini-masterpieces. There are options to adjust camera placement, for instance, to define lens parameters, choreograph camera movement, and even add effects including slo-mo and speed-ups.


You can get a taste of the tools available in Sloclap&#x27;s autumn update trailer below.

                              <span>Activision has launched a fresh legal front in its ongoing battle against the State of California, which has been suing the Call of Duty publisher over reports of workplace misconduct and sexual harassment since the summer of 2021. 


In response, Activision has now filed its own lawsuit against California&#x27;s recently-renamed Civil Rights Department (CRD) - the same agency currently trying to sue Activision - over claims the department has taken too long with its own case and not been transparent over its connections with the media and labour unions (thanks, Axios). 


Activision is now asking a judge to force the CRD (previously the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, or DFEH) to produce various internal documents. These include details of the department&#x27;s discussions with the Communication Workers of America, the union which has been repeatedly in the headlines this year for helping organise games industry QA staff (including several teams at Activision).

                              <span>Ahead of an official announcement by the developer, Sony has accidentally leaked the existence of a Forspoken demo. 


A tweet from PlayStation Japan, that has since been deleted, was spotted making the rounds earlier today. Its translation reveals that a demo for Forspoken will be announced on 9th December.


Meanwhile, over on the main PlayStation account, the team has a small reel promoting an 11-minute long Forspoken stream that promises to show off new gameplay.

                              <span>It&#x27;s nearly Christmas, I&#x27;ve lost all feeling in my fingers due to the bitter cold and it&#x27;s time for an established December tradition to kick off the festive season - doing our very best to stay awake through the night for The Geoffs and all the magic it might bring. 


We&#x27;re promised a bumper show from The Game Awards tonight, with the inevitable Hideo Kojima-shaped announcement - Geoff can&#x27;t let a show go by without a nod to his bessie - plus news on the likes of Street Fighter 5, Jedi Survivor and Diablo 4 and plenty more besides. And only a small amount of it has leaked ahead of time! 


The show kicks off at 12.30am, and while we&#x27;re also promised a more compact running order than previous years I&#x27;d expect a runtime north of two hours. So do bring caffeine, and lots of it.

                              <span>Nintendo has wielded its heavy hand once more, this time on popular YouTube channel Did You Know Gaming. 


The channel, which frequently reports on trivia from a specific game or franchise, has been issued a takedown notice from Nintendo. This takedown pertains specifically to Did You Know Gaming&#x27;s video on Heroes of Hyrule - a Zelda game for the Nintendo DS akin to Final Fantasy Tactics, that was pitched to Nintendo by Retro Studios.


In response to this notice, Did You Know Gaming stated it considers this move by Nintendo a &quot;slap in the face for video game history preservation&quot;.

                              <span>Have you ever reached Minecraft&#x27;s end credits? Doing so requires visiting its hard-to-reach The End dimension and defeating the Elder Dragon boss who dwells there. 


If you have got past this point, you&#x27;ll likely remember the bizarre eight-minute scrolling text story which comes next, before the end credits begin proper. 


It&#x27;s a truly odd read - structured as a conversation between two higher beings apparently observing you - the player. Perhaps even odder, it was never officially licensed to Minecraft developer Mojang, and subsequently is not owned by Microsoft.

The Metal Gear Solid creator has been releasing a steady stream of mysterious teasers for his upcoming game for a while now, and today brings us one more.


Like his previous ones for Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna, this latest teaser shows a blanked out visage with some cryptic wording written across it (which, in this case, reads &quot;How come?&quot;).

                              <span>Upon its release, Days Gone was met with middling reviews across the board. In our own review, in which Sony Bend&#x27;s take on a zombie apocalypse was not awarded a badge, Malindy Hetfeld described it as &quot;a shallow copy of many better open-world action games&quot;.


And Malindy wasn&#x27;t alone in thinking this way. Even the powers that be at Sony reportedly didn&#x27;t feel the game warranted a sequel. 


But, according to Days Gone director John Garvin, the game itself was not to blame for this tepid reception. Rather, it &quot;failed&quot; because of a combination of &quot;tech issues&quot;, &quot;reviewers who couldn&#x27;t be bothered to actually play the game&quot; and &quot;woke reviewers who couldn&#x27;t handle a gruff white biker looking at his date&#x27;s ass.&quot; Errm, ok then.

Racing ahead in first place after some perfect corner drifting and expertly timed green shell throwing, you&#x27;re slammed with a blue shell ahead of the finish line and drop back into last place. Is there anything more infuriating?


No more! A new update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch adds a custom item option and it&#x27;s the best thing to happen to the game. 


Honestly I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s taken Nintendo this long to implement. Yes, items are used to even out the skill levels of racers as well as increase the mayhem, but item customisation was included in Super Smash Bros years ago. Finally Mario Kart gets the same treatment.

The PS5 has proved hard to find ever since it arrived two years ago, with stock problems leading to shortages and scalping. 


PS5 availability has been a global issue, though one Sony now says it has solved in its home country. Speaking at the recent PlayStation Partner Awards event in Japan, company boss Jim Ryan said the console&#x27;s ongoing supply problems had now finally been put to bed.

                              <span>A release date for Street Fighter 6 has popped up on the PlayStation Store, hours ahead of its likely promotion tonight at this year&#x27;s The Game Awards. 


According to the listing, Street Fighter 6 will launch on 2nd June 2023, with a Standard and Deluxe Edition - the latter of which will include the game&#x27;s Year 1 Character Pass.


A third option, for the game&#x27;s Ultimate Edition, replaces the Year 1 Character Pass for the Year 1 Ultimate Pass. We may find out more about all that this evening.

                              <span>A lorry containing over £500k of Evercade EXP Limited Edition stock has been reported stolen, in what developer Blaze Entertainment has described as a &quot;terrible, potentially organised attack&quot;. 


Exact details of the theft are unclear, though it&#x27;s reported the incident took place as stock was being moved between warehouses. Nobody was injured, but all stock was taken.


The £130 gaming handhelds had been destined for despatch to customers in the UK and USA, and elsewhere in the world outside of Europe. A separate consignment bound for customers in mainland Europe is unaffected.

                              <span>Sony is giving players the opportunity to try out the online multiplayer portion of its PlayStation Plus subscription service for free this weekend, starting on Saturday, 10th December.


That means anyone can put PlayStation 4 and 5&#x27;s online multiplayer through its paces - teaming up with friends, strangers, or other non-specific entities across all multiplayer-supporting games - between 10th-11th December without needing to cough up the usual fee.


The requirements to particpate are fairly obvious: players will need to register a PSN account, will need an active internet connection, and will need access to a game that supports online play. Why not, for instance, give Elden Ring&#x27;s new PvP-focused Colosseum update a try?

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s free-to-play mobile shooter The Division Resurgence is launching a closed-beta-style &quot;live test&quot; tomorrow, 8th December, for select participants on Android - and there&#x27;s a new trailer to accompany the announcement.


Resurgence (not to be confused with Heartland, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play Division game for PC and consoles), will, like other titles in the series, be an open-world third-person shooter RPG set in post-crisis America - specifically, Manhattan - following a deadly virus outbreak.


Ubisoft&#x27;s previous chatter around Resurgence has promised a fresh story campaign offering a &quot;new perspective on key story events&quot; from past The Division games, with players once again being cast as agents allied to the Strategic Homeland.

                              <span>Legendary game designer Jeff Minter and his Llamasoft outfit is back with another blast of psychedelic shooter action, this time in the form of Akka Arrh - a &quot;reimagining&quot; of an &#x27;80s arcade cabinet game that never actually released.


This, of course, is a somewhat different scenario to Minter&#x27;s Polybius, which was inspired by an &#x27;80s arcade cabinet game that never actually existed. Akka Arrh, though, is very much a thing, having been designed by Atari&#x27;s Mike Hally and Dave Ralston as a prototype back in 1982.


Minter&#x27;s reimagining of Akka Arrh - of which only three cabinets are still said to exist - has been created in partnership with Atari, and promises &quot;a cascade of words, colour, shapes and sound [flowing] around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers&quot;.

                              <span>Delightful VR fantasy adventure Moss and its sequel have been confirmed as PSVR2 launch titles, with both games arriving alongside Sony&#x27;s new hardware on 22nd February next year.


The original Moss, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, initially launched as a PSVR exclusive back in 2018, gaining widespread acclaim for its charming tale of a tiny mouse, Quill, on a journey through a beautiful, human-sized fantasy world. Eurogamer called it &quot;the finest PSVR game to date&quot;.


Its best trick was its hybrid first-person/-third-person perspective, giving players full control over Quill while simultaneously letting them view the action through the eyes of a spirit, able to interact with the environment to solve puzzles and help Quill on her journey.

                              <span>Cast your mind back to the early 90s and you may recall two aliens with a love for funk music crash landing on earth. These aliens were ToeJam and Earl, and their initial crash landing here (all via the Sega Mega Drive) resulted in their names being elevated to somewhat of a cult status in the industry. 


Now, over 30 years since their first landing, ToeJam and Earl will soon be coming to a new medium. Yes, these two aliens will be joining the likes of Lara Croft, Nathan Drake and Mario, who have all made the transition to the big screen. 


Per The Hollywood Reporter, a new feature film from Amazon based on ToeJam and Earl&#x27;s video game escapades will be heading our way sometime in the future. This upcoming project will be written by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, whose previous work includes Hotel Transylvania 4. Meanwhile, basketball player Stephen Curry will also be producing the project through his production company Unanimous Media.

                              <span>No blue shells? ALL BLUE SHELLS? Beautiful, perpetual chaos can now be yours whenever you desire, thanks to a free new Mario Kart 8 Deluxe update enabling players to define exactly which items they want to appear in their games.


As detailed in Nintendo&#x27;s announcement tweet, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s new custom item feature works with offline VS races, as well as &quot;certain&quot; online modes, and gives players the ability to either randomise items that&#x27;ll be available in their races or to toggle specific items on or off. And yes, that means competitions can now be entirely item-free.


That&#x27;s not quite the end of it, either; in Team Races and Battles, it&#x27;s even possible to allocate items to specific teams, meaning you can really pile on the pressure - perhaps all spiny shells against an increasingly sweaty palmed team armed with nothing but hooters?

                              <span>Fans of Sonic the Hedgehog and Genshin Impact are fighting over various claims of foul play in relation to this year&#x27;s Players&#x27; Voice fan vote at tomorrow&#x27;s Game Awards.


The Players&#x27; Voice category is a 100 percent fan-voted award which this year has five possible choices as its finalists: Elden Ring, Genshin Impact, Stray, God of War Ragnarok and Sonic Frontiers. Over the past week, the vote has become mired in controversy amidst accusations of a broken poll, bots and bribery.


To be clear, there&#x27;s no credible evidence of bribery, despite various fan claims foul play must be to blame for both Sonic (with a lower Metacritic score than other entrants) and Genshin Impact (whose detractors point out was first released in 2020) being way-off in the lead.

As part of this announcement, Spencer stated &quot;Microsoft is committed to helping bring more games to more people - however they choose to play.&quot;


So, how do people choose to play Call of Duty? Well, for this current generation of consoles at least, not on a Nintendo Switch. There simply just isn&#x27;t the option to do so.

Japanese newspaper Asahi reported today that Naka now stands accused of violating financial laws in relation to another mobile game it is claimed he had insider knowledge of - Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier.


Specifically, Naka is accused of purchasing 144.7m yen&#x27;s worth of shares in its developer ATeam (worth around £865k) before The First Soldier was officially announced.

                              <span>Fortnite continues to be a fixture of England&#x27;s World Cup squad, four years after the popular battle royale&#x27;s celebration dances became a common sight on Russia&#x27;s pitches.


This week, England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was shown footage of himself lugging a monogrammed computer case to 2022&#x27;s controversial Qatar tournament, as part of an official interview released on the England squad YouTube channel.


Pickford was asked what he was getting up to during his downtime - and, amongst other things, eventually revealed he was still hooked to Fortnite. (And no wonder - its freshly-minted Chapter 4 has reinvented the game.)

In short, some mods will still work, but others won&#x27;t (especially those based on scripts) - and CD Projekt has tested and compiled a list of how the most popular will fare so fans and mod makers can prepare ahead of time.


A further group of mods will be included as part of the update - now part of the game proper, with their original creators reimbursed and credited.

                              <span>Microsoft has agreed a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo if its buyout of Activision Blizzard goes through.


Xbox boss Phil Spencer tweeted the announcement, which also confirms the company&#x27;s commitment to continue to release Call of Duty games on Valve&#x27;s Steam platform &quot;simultaneously to Xbox&quot;, if the gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard is approved. Call of Duty&#x27;s latest releases, Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0, are already on Steam.


The announcement is a direct response to the scrutiny the acquisition has come under from a raft of organisations across the world, chief among them the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK.

                              <span>This is a really interesting paper that discusses what the authors call the Decoupling Principle:
The idea is simple, yet previously not clearly articulated: to ensure privacy, information should be divided architecturally and institutionally such that each entity has only the information they need to perform their relevant function. Architectural decoupling entails splitting functionality for different fundamental actions in a system, such as decoupling authentication (proving who is allowed to use the network) from connectivity (establishing session state for communicating). Institutional decoupling entails splitting what information remains between non-colluding entities, such as distinct companies or network operators, or between a user and network peers. This decoupling makes service providers individually breach-proof, as they each have little or no sensitive data that can be lost to hackers. Put simply, the Decoupling Principle suggests always separating who you are from what you do...</span>

Those looking to add a bit more visual pizazz to GTA Online on current-gen consoles will have the option to activate real-time ray-traced reflections - which will be applied across &quot;many&quot; surfaces - via the Fidelity Mode graphics setting when the update hits.


Elsewhere in December&#x27;s update, Rockstar is making the retro-styled Declasse Tahoma Coupe available for purchase by all for a limited time in celebration of players collectively amassing four trillion GTA$ in the recent Heists Challenge.

                              <span>Eight years since its initial unveiling and multiple delays later, Dead Island 2 is finally almost upon us - and ahead of its launch next April, publisher Deep Silver has shared more of its open-world, zombie-pulverising antics in a new digital showcase.


Those with itchy fast-forward fingers will be pleased to know the vast majority of Dead Island 2&#x27;s 15-minute showcase is taken up by largely uninformative live-action sequences, featuring a group of zombie apocalypse survivors as they stumble across a copy of Dead Island 2 in a fancy LA mansion. It&#x27;s entirely inessential fluff, but, tucked between all that, Deep Silver does manage to squeeze in a few minutes of gameplay.


Admittedly, there&#x27;s little that&#x27;s particularly revelatory in there - the publisher basically just used the time to reiterate the obvious fact you&#x27;ll mostly be maiming various zombie types gruesomely until they&#x27;re dead - but it did give us a decent new look at Dead Island 2&#x27;s appealingly sun-kissed gore, as well as a taste of its weapon roster, including hammers, machetes, bear claws, a &quot;shit-tonne of guns&quot;, and various makeshift tools of destruction.

                              <span>Halo Infinite has released its December update, bringing with it the earlier-than-anticipated arrival of a custom game browser, an updated version of Halo 3&#x27;s The Pit map, and more.


Halo Infinite&#x27;s new custom game browser is designed to work in tandem with the Forge Beta introduced as part of November&#x27;s Winter Update. It was originally planned for release as part of next year&#x27;s Season 3, but as developer 343 Industries explains in its blog post, &quot;We fully agree with players who felt [it] should be a priority — it&#x27;s a key support structure for what players create in Forge and a pillar for the community.&quot; 343 says this initial V1 release is &quot;likely to have some rough edges&quot; but will continue to evolve over time.


Elsewhere, today&#x27;s update introduces Empyrean, a &quot;reimagining&quot; of Halo 3&#x27;s The Pit map that&#x27;s been officially rebuilt in Forge by 343. &quot;How do Halo Infinite&#x27;s toys, like its limited-use Equipment, alter some of those dynamics and affect how you traverse the combat dance floor?,&quot; the developer asks in its introduction. &quot;Maybe the enemy team managed to grab the rockets first, but you went and acquired the Repulsor to protect yourself... We can&#x27;t wait to see what new memories are forged in this proving ground!

                              <span>Hindsight, the acclaimed narrative adventure from developer Joel MacDonald and publisher Annapurna Interactive - in which players experience a woman&#x27;s entire life, from birth to the present day - is now available on Xbox One and PlayStation. 


Hindsight is the follow-up McDonald&#x27;s acclaimed iOS botanical puzzler Prune (McDonald is also a former Call of Duty designer) and tells the story of a woman revisiting her childhood home following her mother&#x27;s death. As she sorts through her old belongings, she unlocks old memories that players can experience first-hand in the form of dioramas.


&quot;Hindsight asks you to slow down and pay attention to the little things left behind,&quot; explains the game&#x27;s official blurb. &quot;Piece these things together and shift your viewpoint until you find just the right perspective to pull you deeper into the past... Linger as long as you wish, but sooner or later you must come back to the present.&quot;

                              <span>Vampire Survivors, the acclaimed minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is getting its first dollop of paid DLC next week in the form of Legacy of the Moonspell, arriving next Thursday, 15th December, on Xbox and PC.


&quot;In eastern lands, a clan has fallen,&quot; explains Poncle in its DLC announcement post. &quot;The Moonspell, once vigilant guardians of a sorcerous valley nestled in the mountains, have been overrun by hordes of yokai and oni. Though treacherous, this hive of spectral activity may provide some clue as to the location of a vampire. If not, at least it&#x27;ll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process.&quot;


More specifically, Legacy of the Moonspell introduces eight new characters - including Miang Moonspell, Menya Moonspell, Syuuto Moonspell, and Babi-Onna - plus new monsters, six new music tracks, and a &quot;huge&quot; new stage incorporating the likes of an abandoned castle, yokai-infested village, and snow-covered mountain.

                              <span>Metroid Prime developer Retro Studio once had an idea for an XCOM-style game starring Samus Aran.


The concept, dubbed Metroid Tactics, was the brainchild of Metroid Prime developer Paul Tozer. The idea was one of several pitched following the conclusion of Retro&#x27;s Metroid Prime trilogy - and another which was ultimately turned down. 


Tozer discussed the pitch publicly for the first time this week in a new Did You Know Gaming video which details the game&#x27;s planned setting and storyline as a prequel to the entire Metroid series.

The emote, named &quot;Tidy&quot;, allows your character to dance like Snoop Dogg in his 2004 song Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot. It&#x27;s one of a handful of emotes from Fortnite&#x27;s early days thought to use unlicensed dance moves - other examples of which sparked largely-unsuccessful legal threats from individuals keen to take Epic Games to court. 


Fans were surprised to see the emote return upon the Item Shop&#x27;s midnight UK time refresh - though its appearance was shortlived, and it was pulled from sale just a couple of hours later.

Key art from marketing material show-off a Japanese theme, with artwork teasing the return of the classic map Castle (thanks, WhatIfGaming).   


Castle was originally a multiplayer map in Call of Duty World at War, set in an old Japanese fortress in World War 2. The map most recently made a return in Call of Duty Vanguard, but this would be the first time the map would appear in the franchise&#x27;s modern theme of shooters.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has announced plans to wind down support for Gwent, its Witcher card game spin-off, and laid out how it will hand over future balancing decisions to Gwent&#x27;s community of players.


The game&#x27;s final 72 cards will release next year in three expansions, set to launch in April, July and September 2023. After this time, CD Projekt will transition from its own monthly balance changes to a system voted on by players. 


Dubbed as &quot;Project Gwenfinity&quot;, the idea is that Gwent can be left to just a skeleton crew within CD Projekt to keep an eye on, while the game&#x27;s community decides on tweaks to exisiting cards to keep up with the current meta.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s big Disney Dreamlight Valley does more than add content themed around Toy Story and Lilo and Stitch - it also brings some welcome performance improvements, tweaks and bug fixes. 


Patch notes promise &quot;optimised game stability on all platforms&quot; but for Nintendo Switch in particular, where developer Gameloft has put a &quot;considerable focus&quot; this time around. 


The popular Disney life sim is now fully compatible with Steam Deck and verified by Steam.

Following a four-week election process, should the majority of workers support unionisation, Microsoft, who purchased Zenimax for $7.5bn in 2021, will recognise the union. 


The company has also pledged to remain neutral throughout this process. &quot;We applaud Microsoft for remaining neutral through this process and letting workers decide for themselves whether they want a union,&quot; said CWA president Christopher Shelton.

                              <span>Microsoft has formally confirmed its offer of a 10-year contract to keep releasing Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms after its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 


In an opinion article on the deal published in the Wall St Journal,  Microsoft president Brad Smith committed to making its 10-year COD contract &quot;legally enforceable by regulators in the US, UK and European Union&quot; - territories in which the company was previously felt to be struggling to get its acquisition agreed without making some sort of concessions.


The majority of the opinion piece repeats the same arguments for the deal we&#x27;ve heard from Microsoft many times before - that it would be good for both consumers and game developers, and that Microsoft is still struggling in a sector where it is &quot;stuck behind Sony&#x27;s dominant PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch&quot;.

                              <span>Xbox will join the growing trend of selling new blockbuster console games for $70 (likely £70) next year. 


This includes the biggest hitters from Microsoft&#x27;s first-party line-up for 2023, such as Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield, Arkane&#x27;s Redfall and the company&#x27;s own Forza Motorsport reboot.


Of course, as is standard on Xbox, all of these will continue to be made available on day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. There&#x27;s no suggestion today of any other pricing being changed - such as for that subscription service, or for Xbox hardware.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has shed more light on the reason why multiplayer never materialised for Cyberpunk 2077. 
Simply put, the game&#x27;s rocky 2020 launch changed the studio&#x27;s plans. CD Projekt Red had to prioritise fixing the single-player experience, and multiplayer suffered as a result.
&quot;We really needed to look at what were the priorities for Cyberpunk [after it launched],&quot; Philipp Weber told me when I visited the studio last week. Weber was senior quest designer and coordinator on Cyberpunk 2077. Today, he&#x27;s acting narrative director of the new Witcher game codenamed Polaris.

                              <span>Earlier this year, we were all surprised to hear that Henry Cavill was stepping away from Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher adaptation. In his stead, The Hunger Games&#x27; Liam Hemsworth would be taking over the role of Geralt of Rivia for the show&#x27;s fourth season.


Now, Netflix is doing what it can to reassure fans that, while this will clearly be a change for the series, it will also bring a &quot;different energy&quot; to the show that the producers are excited about.

Speaking at The Witcher: Blood Origin&#x27;s UK junket, showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich addressed the series&#x27; recasting with a variety of outlets.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 will be re-released with a Game of the Year edition, developer CD Projekt has confirmed. 


As you might expect, this package will include next year&#x27;s paid-for Phantom Liberty expansion, as well as all other free updates released so far. 


The announcement of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s Game of the Year Edition package has raised some eyebrows considering the game&#x27;s state in the year that it launched, though the &quot;GOTY Edition&quot; branding has now been so over-used it should hardly come as a surprise.

                              <span>Music-mixing rhythm game Fuser will go offline on 19th December, developer Harmonix announced today. 


Existing owners of the game will be able to continue playing the game&#x27;s Campaign and Quick Play modes with any previously-purchased DLC after this date - though offline only. 


A blog post on Fuser&#x27;s website announced the shutdown of live services last week, and confirmed the game and its DLC would all be withdrawn from sale.

According to Steam, players will be able to head to a galaxy far, far away with Cal Kestis on 16th March, 2023. This date was visible briefly this afternoon - though has now been changed to &quot;coming soon&quot;.


Many were expecting Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#x27;s release date to be revealed at The Game Awards this Thursday, so we will let you know when this date is made official.

                              <span>Panda, the eSports organisation at the centre of a high-profile row between Super Smash Bros. fans and Nintendo, has ditched its controversial CEO following complaints about his behaviour. 


In a statement issued this morning via Twitter, Panda confirmed it had &quot;heard the concerns of the Smash community&quot; and booted out its boss Alan Bunney. The company will now work with &quot;outside advisors to form a temporary interim management committee&quot; as players quit the company&#x27;s events in their dozens.


It follows a week of bad press for Bunney and his company, as it emerged Nintendo was shutting down a fan-run Smash Bros. tournament and continuing to partner with Panda.

                              <span>This weekend, we got another look at HBO&#x27;s upcoming The Last of Us TV adaptation. 


I am a big The Last of Us fan (something you may have noticed), and have watched this trailer multiple times already. Now, for your pleasure, I have pulled out some of the little details that you may have missed on a first watch. 


As a quick recap before we dive on in, you can see this trailer below. Please note, after the video I will be discussing points that could be considered spoilers for Naughty Dog&#x27;s video game series. If you are keen to avoid these, this is your cue to head elsewhere.

It&#x27;s this Discord server that was targeted with a subpoena by the gatcha game&#x27;s publishing label Cognosphere.

                              <span>Blizzard&#x27;s Albany-based band of Diablo testers have now formally formed a union, following months of delay.


The small QA (quality assurance) team at Blizzard Albany first anounced its intent to unionise back in July this year. 


The team now becomes the second group of testers within Activision Blizzard to successfully do so, following the similarly long-running push by QA staff at Call of Duty studio Raven Software.

In the UK weekly boxed game chart, the new Need for Speed only managed to chart in 17th place - that&#x27;s behind last year&#x27;s Just Dance 2022 and the Lego Harry Potter Collection. 


UK sales data seen by GamesIndustry.biz reveals the game&#x27;s physical sales were down 64 percent on the series&#x27; previous entry, 2019&#x27;s Need for Speed: Heat.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission reportedly looks to be leaning towards an approval of Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn Activision Blizzard takeover.


Previously, the FTC&#x27;s involvement in the deal had signalled a headache for Microsoft, which is facing regulatory approval around the world, and close scrutiny here in the UK. A lawsuit looked imminent - potentially blocking the acquisition, or carving out major concessions.


However, a fresh report by the New York Post into the FTC panel set to decide the deal&#x27;s fate suggests the trade body is now looking more likely to let it pass.

                              <span>Striking Distance has released a new patch for The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s console versions. This follows on from its PC patch, which was released over the weekend.


This console patch is set to take aim at the various frame-rate and crashing issues that have been widely reported since the game&#x27;s release last Friday. 


&quot;We are listening, working hard on updates, and will have details to share on more upcoming improvements early this week,&quot; the developer wrote before thanking everyone for their ongoing patience.

As an actual human and not a bot, I had no idea how to answer. Is this a joke? (Seems not.) Is it a Magritte-like existential question? (It’s not a bicycle. It’s a drawing of a bicycle. Actually, it’s a photograph of a drawing of a bicycle. No, it’s really a computer image of a photograph of a drawing of a bicycle.) Am I overthinking this? (Definitely.)

It’s probably the best CAPTCHA I have ever encountered; a computer would have just answered...</span>

Forensic container checkpointing is based on Checkpoint/Restore In
Userspace (CRIU) and allows the creation of stateful copies
of a running container without the container knowing that it is being
checkpointed. The copy of the container can be analyzed and restored in a
sandbox environment multiple times without the original container being aware
of it. Forensic container checkpointing was introduced as an alpha feature in
Kubernetes v1.25.
How does it work?
With the help of CRIU it is possible to checkpoint and restore containers.
CRIU is integrated in runc, crun, CRI-O and containerd and forensic container
checkpointing as implemented in Kubernetes uses these existing CRIU
integrations.
Why is it important?
With the help of CRIU and the corresponding integ…</span>

                              <span>The creator of the acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer, Dead Cells, has revealed their next project: Nuclear Blaze. 

Sébastien Bénard&#x27;s Nuclear Blaze is expected to release on consoles on 28th April, 2023 and will set you back €15/$15 (sorry, I don&#x27;t have UK specific pricing at the time of writing) for a digital copy, and €30/$30 if you fancy a physical copy on either Switch or PS4. 

You&#x27;ll have to jump over to Red Art Games to pre-order a physical copy, although by doing so, you&#x27;ll secure a set of three &quot;Exclusive Nuclear Balze enamel pins&quot;. Physical copies also include a booklet including an interview with Bénard and a keychain.
