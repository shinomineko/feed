                              <span>Diablo 2: Resurrected has launched a public test realm for the upcoming 2.5 patch that boasts an all-new &quot;experimental&quot; feature: Terror Zones.

As well as a &quot;variety of bug fixes to address feedback the community has provided&quot; Blizzard, Terror Zones see you take up monsters at least two levels higher than you (or their original level) for extra XP and loot in the hope we&#x27;ll stop &quot;repeatedly farming&quot; Baal, Diablo, or Nihlathak.

&quot;The journey to level 99 is a celebrated experience for players and quite the milestone if achieved - a rite of passage, even,&quot; Blizzard explains in the patch notes. &quot;We want to offer an alternative to repeatedly farming Baal, Diablo, or Nihlathak. We also want the journey to level 99 to be accessible to a larger population of players, full of variety, and most importantly, challenging - this is where Terror Zones come in. As we get into details, please note that players can choose to opt-out of Terror Zones if desired.

2K also confirmed that the annual $250,000 MyTEAM Unlimited tournament is back this year, too, with two tracks: one for last-gen consoles, and another for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.

Triple Threat Online: Co-op - a new mode to MyTEAM - allows players to partner with friends for 3v3 co-op &quot;across different variations&quot; of gameplay. There&#x27;s also Unlimited, which allows players that reach the top tier to start over and unlock &quot;even more rewards&quot; via Season Points, and Clutch Time Single Player enables you to &quot;jump into a single player version of Clutch Time, a fast-paced mode with a 4-point line, to take your best starting five and compete against the AI&quot;.

In anticipation of the full release - which will be coming to Steam - developer Bippinbits will be taking down its free playable demo on 5th September, so don&#x27;t hang about if you&#x27;ve been meaning to try it.

Dome Keeper - once known as Dome Romantik - boasts &quot;beautiful updated pixel art, atmospheric music and sound&quot; and sees you defend your dome from wave after wave of hostile attacks in this roguelike survival miner. Inbetween attacks, you need to dig beneath the surface in search of valuable resources which can be used to make upgrades to help you stay alive and &quot;make it to the next world&quot;.

                              <span>In news that&#x27;s unlikely to surprise you, Netflix has cancelled its Resident Evil series after just a single season.

The show - which stars Ella Balinska, Tamara Smart, and Lance Reddick - only debuted on 14th July, but Deadline reports that &quot;as the drama did not have a particularly strong showing on Netflix&#x27;s Top 10 and cost vs. viewing is the streamer&#x27;s leading renewal criterion&quot;, Netflix has declined to order a second series.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the show is currently sitting at 55 per cent for critics, with an audience score of 27 per cent. On Metacritic, it&#x27;s even worse, boasting a critic score of 53 and a user score of 1.5. Ouch.

                              <span>I’ve been saying that complexity is the worst enemy of security for a long time now. (Here’s me in 1999.) And it’s been true for a long time.
In 2018, Thomas Dullien of Google’s Project Zero talked about “cheap complexity.” Andrew Appel summarizes:
The anomaly of cheap complexity.  For most of human history, a more complex device was more expensive to build than a simpler device.  This is not the case in modern computing. It is often more cost-effective to take a very complicated device, and make it simulate simplicity, than to make a simpler device.  This is because of economies of scale: complex general-purpose CPUs are cheap.  On the other hand, custom-designed, ...</span>

                              <span>Guacamelee developer Drinkbox Studios has announced Frozen Hearth, a new chunk of paid DLC heading to its action-RPG Nobody Saves the World on 13th September.


Frozen Hearth takes players to a forgotten new region, deep underground, &quot;where the strongest warriors compete for glory in The Tempering&quot;. Here, hardy adventurers can tackle a series of puzzles and challenges intended to test their transformation skills and creativity, unlocking the new Killer Bee and Mechanic forms that can be used in the DLC and main game.


&quot;When we shipped the original game, there were so many ideas we had to leave on the cutting room floor, and this DLC gave us a chance to bring some of them to life,&quot; Nobody Saves the World lead designer Ian Campbell explained in a statement accompanying today&#x27;s announcement. &quot;We had a blast creating even more forms, as well as puzzles and challenges that make the most of the game’s mix-and-match customisation&quot;.

                              <span>Digital Extremes has shared more on Warframe&#x27;s Veilbreaker update, confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for all platforms some time in September, and that players will be able to get instant free access to Styanax - the sci-fi shooter&#x27;s 50th Warframe - for two weeks after its arrival.


Styanax - who gets a proper introduction in the animated Ascension Day trailer below - is described as a &quot;mighty and herculean&quot; Warframe whose designed is inspired by the ancient Greek warrior Astyanax. His abilities include the Axios Javelin - which can push back enemies on impact, causing damage if they hit a wall - and the Tharros Strike shield, capable of repelling enemies and reducing their shields and armour as it&#x27;s swung around, regenerating Styanax&#x27;s health with each successfully landed blow.

Styanax can also call on Rally Point to draw enemies to his position and regenerate the energy and shields of nearby allies (regeneration increases as the number of enemies near him grows), or deploy Final Stand - causing him to rise into the air and unleash a barrage of javelins that&#x27;ll damage nearby enemies upon hitting the ground. Additional damage occurs on a direct hit.

                              <span>Developer Sloclap has detailed Sifu&#x27;s big summer update - which is set to bring the likes of a new scoring system and gameplay modifiers - ahead of its arrival next Wednesday, 31st August.


Top of the list of new additions for the kung-fu beat-&#x27;em-up is the aforementioned new scoring system, which will &quot;take into account every punch, kick, sweep and finisher performed&quot; in order to rank players based on smoothness, efficiency and variety. &quot;Dismantle a group of enemies without getting hit,&quot; Sloclap adds, &quot;and players will be greeted with a score worth flaunting.&quot;


Elsewhere, next week&#x27;s update brings a range of modifiers designed to suit all tastes. At one end of the spectrum, struggling players will be able to significantly reduce Sifu&#x27;s challenge by giving themselves the likes of infinite health, structure, and unbreakable weapons. Those looking to further test their mettle, however, can prevent themselves from picking up weapons and set enemies to ignore guarding, or go even further by reducing their character down to a single hit point and bumping enemy strength up even further.

This includes a new feature that will enable players to play dialogue through the console&#x27;s DualSense controller as haptic feedback.


This new feature, which started off as a prototype, means that &quot;a deaf player can feel the way a line is delivered, can feel the emphasis, along with the subtitles to give some sense of how that line is delivered,&quot; explained game director Matthew Gallant.

The Soulslike game was announced during the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase in June and will be released in 2023 across Xbox consoles and PC (Game Pass on both), and PlayStation consoles.


It&#x27;s led by producers Fumihiko Yasuda (Nioh) and Masaaki Yamagiwa (Bloodborne), and judging by the below trailer it certainly looks familiar.

Earlier this month, footage of the controller surfaced on YouTube, and pictures of its packaging were posted to Twitter back in March.

Microsoft has not made an official statement regarding the white controller&#x27;s release, or even acknowledging that it is real, but more solid evidence of its existence has appeared.

Now, three months later, the acquisition has been completed, according to a press release from Embracer.

                              <span>As part of its latest Treehouse: Live showcase, Nintendo has shared a lengthy look at Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming fantasy farming sim Harvestella, showing off its story, its world exploration and combat, its farming, fishing, and more.


Harvestella - a sort of blend of Final Fantasy, Harvest Moon, and Rune Factory - begins with players waking up with a bad case of amnesia in a world where the seasons are governed by four giant crystals known as Seaslight. Unfortunately for the locals, something has gone awry and a deadly dust known as the Quietus has started seeping from the crystals, trapping people indoors and causing crops to wither and die.


And that&#x27;s not the end of their problems; as players settle into a vacant house on the outskirts of Lethe Village, a huge comet falls to the earth nearby, bringing with it the armoured body of an Omen, thought to be the cause of the calamity. We see some of this in Nintendo&#x27;s showcase, but the bulk of the play-through is focused around Harvestella&#x27;s second chapter as players start to explore the dungeon-like Higan Canyon, with help from new pal Dianthus.

                              <span>Nintendo has joined Microsoft in responding to this week&#x27;s shock PlayStation 5 price hike, and said it had &quot;no plans&quot; to similarly bump up the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s cost.


In a statement issued to Eurogamer this morning, Nintendo confirmed it had &quot;no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware&quot;. 


The response goes further than that of Microsoft&#x27;s, which last night noted Sony&#x27;s dramatic decision by simply stating it was keen to &quot;offer our fans great gaming options&quot;, before reiterating the Xbox Series X and S&#x27;s launch price point.

As a reminder, Splatoon lore fans believe that Nintendo&#x27;s shooter series is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the sea levels have risen and much of our current world is underwater.


Indeed, the new map - apparently uncovered from the files of Splatoon 3&#x27;s World Premiere Splatfest demo - appears to support that claim.

                              <span>Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a new Puzzle Bobble game exclusive to Nintendo Switch.

If you don&#x27;t know what Puzzle Bobble is, it started out as a match-three arcade game based off Bubble Bobble. Players are faced with a prearranged pattern of coloured bubbles, and must fire bubbles up towards their matching colours to clear the screen before the bubbles get too low.
Bubble Bobble&#x27;s Puzzle Bobble&#x27;s Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! sure is one heck of a tongue twister.

A Denuvo spokeperson has since responded to questions surrounding the software, as well as the driving parties behind it.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve finally seen Big the Cat in Sonic Frontiers.


The big purple creature first appeared in Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast and has since become a fan favourite character, appearing in a number of games in the series.


It&#x27;s been known for a while that Big the Cat would feature, but thanks to Twitter user Bibs he&#x27;s been spotted with Sonic in-game at Gamescom.

                              <span>Developer Creative Assembly has revealed it is working on a new &quot;action project&quot; that will sit alongside the likes of Total War and its long-in-the-works sci-fi shooter Hyenas.


But don&#x27;t expect to hear more on this project anytime soon, Creative Assembly said today. Instead, there will be a &quot;significant wait before further details are revealed&quot; on this new franchise. Intriguingly, the company noted it also had plans for a separate &quot;yet to be announced project&quot;. 


While Creative Assembly did not go into any specifics about what its new action project will look like, it did state that its studio in Sofia would be leading its development, and noted it was now looking for candidates to join the team that had &quot;experience working on third-person titles using the Unreal 5 engine&quot;.

                              <span>A first glimpse at gameplay from the next Need for Speed has popped up online, showing off the game&#x27;s new visual style.


Reportedly due out this November, publisher EA has officially kept very quiet about its upcoming racer, which was previously delayed from 2021. 


This week, screenshots apparently from a work-in-progress build of the still-untitled game began to appear on reddit. Last night, the brief gameplay clip these images were taken from was also posted.

                              <span>Following Sony&#x27;s announcement that it will be raising the price of PlayStation 5 in select countries, Microsoft has responded to the news, merely noting that existing Xbox Series X/S prices remain the same.


Sony announced it would be increasing the cost of PlayStation 5 - in response to &quot;high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends&quot; - earlier today, with the price hike impacting most markets around the world, effective immediately.


That increase affects both the disc and disc-less models of PS5, and equates to £30 in the UK and €50 in Europe - with similar bumps occurring in Japan, China, Australia, Mexico, and Canada, but not the US for the time being.

When word of the BioShock adaptation first broke in February, there was little to go on beyond the fact it was being developed alongside publisher Take-Two and Vertigo Entertainment with an eye on turning it into a cinematic universe.


Now, though, Netflix has revealed that two key roles on the project have now been filled, with Francis Lawrence having signed on in the director role.

                              <span>It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks since Capcom dropped the first free title update for Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion, but already the publisher is teasing Update 2, with a first look at incoming new monster variant Flaming Espinas.


Espinas returned to the Monster Hunter series back in August with the launch of Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion, marking the first time the creature had made the roster in a new game since its debut in 2008&#x27;s Monster Hunter Frontier 2.0.


In its base form, Espinas is a Flying Wyvern capable of paralysis, poison, and fireblight, and while Capcom is yet to reveal how Title Update 2&#x27;s new Flaming Espinas variant will differ, there&#x27;s a look at the creature in the publisher&#x27;s newly revealed teaser trailer below.

                              <span>Anyone with a hankering for some glum action-adventuring should keep an eye on the Epic Games Store next, when Shadow of the Tomb Raider - the final instalment in Square Enix&#x27;s gloomy rebooted series - will be free to download, alongside Submerged: Hidden Depths.


Shadow of the Tomb Raider, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, picks up its narrative around a year after the events of 2015&#x27;s Rise of the Tomb Raider, following young Lara Croft as she races through the Peruvian jungle in a bid to stop a Mayan apocalypse.


&quot;This is a well-crafted and polished experience,&quot; Eurogamer&#x27;s Aoife Wilson wrote in her Shadow of the Tomb Raider review in 2018, &quot;and when [it] actually gives you full control and leaves you alone to seek out its quieter mysteries, it can render you wide-eyed with wonder&quot;.

                              <span>More details about the 40th Anniversary Edition of Microsoft Flight Simulator have been released to celebrate the return of Gamescom.
Previously, a few of the aircraft to appear in it were confirmed for the special edition during the Xbox Showcase back in June.
Meanwhile, the game&#x27;s first ever city update, available from today, is detailed in an Xbox blog. Five German photogrammetry cities have been added to the game: Hanover, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Bonn and Cologne. Players can download the update for free from the game&#x27;s marketplace and take in the sights of Germany from the air.

Now, it has been announced that Steve Blackman, who is the showrunner for The Umbrella Academy (as well as working on the currently in development ISS drama Orbital) will be responsible for this upcoming adaptation (via Deadline).

Blackman spoke of his enthusiasm for the Netflix project, calling Guerrilla&#x27;s Horizon Zero Dawn an &quot;exceptionally well-crafted game with wonderful characters not often seen in the rank-and-file of the gaming world.&quot;

                              <span>Graphics card maker Nvidia is also feeling the sting of the current economic climate.
Its recent financial report revealed the company fell short of Wall Street&#x27;s Q3 expectations, blaming &quot;challenging market conditions&quot; for this setback (via CNBC).

Two weeks ago, Nvidia predicted it would not meet Wall Street&#x27;s finacial estimates, commenting that it had seen a significant slow down in growth driven by &quot;disappointing&quot; sales. At this time, Nvidia also stated it would see a decline in its gross margin.

                              <span>Ahead of its appearance at Gamescom, Eurogamer was given the chance to watch a pre-prepared keynote on The Devil In Me, the next instalment and first season finale of Supermassive Games’ The Dark Pictures Anthology. The preview, hosted by director Tom Heaton, included footage from one of the episode’s later scenes, and a look at its various gameplay improvements.

This early look began by introducing the story and main characters of The Devil In Me, and setting up its stakes. Supermassive’s latest horror chapter centres on Lonnit Entertainment, a small TV production company developing a documentary series on famous serial killers, and a gentleman named Granthem Du&#x27;Met, who inherited a hotel with reproductions of rooms from HH Holmes&#x27; infamous “Murder Castle”. Once the team arrives to meet Du&#x27;Met, however, it&#x27;s clear the hotel is a much more accurate reproduction than they previously realised.
Kate Wilder, played by Jessie Buckley, stars as the show&#x27;s presenter. In our preview she was described as introverted and lacking self-confidence, but with a fierce determination to do the right thing. Heaton later told me that Wilder was &quot;quite damaged&quot; when I asked more about the character. &quot;She&#x27;s carrying this secret most of the people on the crew don&#x27;t know about at all,&quot; he said, and added that she could sometimes snap at people while attempting to process issues from the past.

                              <span>Sony has announced a shock price rise for the PlayStation 5, and in a Eurogamer Newscast special, we&#x27;re here to discuss why the company has pulled this undoubtedly unpopular move - and why it&#x27;s likely to get away with it. 

Will Sony sell fewer PS5s as a result? It seems unlikely. But it&#x27;s more pressure on PlayStation, which has already had to defend its £70/$70 price point for games - including the upcoming The Last of Us: Part 1 remaster - and just this week announced an expensive-looking new PlayStation 5 controller. 
At a time when all of us are looking at our bank balance&#x27;s bottom line, an extra £30 to buy a PS5 marks not just an unprecedented decision by Sony, but a troubling sign of the times. Will Microsoft now feel emboldened to follow suit, or soak up any extra costs as a point of difference? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan discuss.

Microsoft observed a campaign that inserted an attacker-controlled proxy site between the account users and the work server they attempted to log into. When the user entered a password into the proxy site, the proxy site sent it to the real server and then relayed the real server’s response back to the user. Once the authentication was completed, the threat actor stole the session cookie the legitimate site sent, so the user doesn’t need to be reauthenticated at every new page visited. The campaign began with a phishing email with an HTML attachment leading to the proxy server...</span>

The release of Kubernetes v1.25 marks a major milestone for Kubernetes out-of-the-box pod security
controls: Pod Security admission (PSA) graduated to stable, and Pod Security Policy (PSP) has been
removed.
PSP was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.21,
and no longer functions in Kubernetes v1.25 and later.
The Pod Security admission controller replaces PodSecurityPolicy, making it easier to enforce predefined
Pod Security Standards by
simply adding a label to a namespace. The Pod Security Standards are maintained by the K8s
community, which means you automatically get updated security policies whenever new

                              <span>Following a not exactly inspiring showing earlier this month, Square Enix has once again reached deep into its Forspokeon promotional sack, this time pulling out a ten-minute trailer showcasing new gameplay from its upcoming open-world fantasy adventure.


Forspoken casts players in the role of Frey Holland - played by Ella Balinska - an &quot;ordinary young woman who must harness her magical abilities to survive&quot; in a &quot;beautiful yet cruel&quot; world of Athia. We get a much better closer at that world in Square&#x27;s latest trailer, which includes a glimpse of the city of Cipal, Athia&#x27;s only safe haven, where refugees gather to escape the corrupting force of the Break. 


Here, players can speak to citizens to take on quests and trade before heading out to explore Athia&#x27;s more dangerous regions, including Praenost - a barren desert where the only signs of life are corrupted enemies - and the lush region of Avoalet with its dangerously mutated beasts.

                              <span>Supermassive Games has announced a release date for its latest Dark Pictures Anthology entry The Devil in Me, which is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 18th November.


The Devil in Me will be the fourth instalment in Supermassive&#x27;s Dark Pictures series - following on from Man of Medan, Little Hope, and House of Ashes - and tells the story of a group of film makers trapped in a replica of H. H. Holmes&#x27; infamous &#x27;Murder Castle&#x27; hotel.


Based on everything shown so far, The Devil in Me looks to be something of a departure from previous anthology entries, trading their supernatural overtones for a more grounded, grisly horror inspired by the likes of the Saw and Hostel movies.

                              <span>District 9 director Neill Blomkamp is making a video game! I knew that. But what I didn&#x27;t know is it&#x27;s one of those blockchain / NFT games.

Sigh.

This evening&#x27;s The Future Games Show ended with a fancy CGI trailer showing off the world of Off the Grid, a free-to-play third-person shooter battle royale from new developer Gunzilla Games.

                              <span>Back in June, Bloober Team - the developer behind The Medium, Observer, and Blair Witch - announced it was remaking Layers of Fear 1 &amp; 2 as a single &quot;psychedelic horror chronicle&quot;, and now the studio has shared a first look at a &quot;brand-new story chapter&quot; in its latest trailer.


Layers of Fears, as the remake is officially (and ridiculously) known, is being co-developed with Anshar Studios, and will see the original Layers of Fear, its Inheritance DLC, and Layers of Fear 2 rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, complete with new visuals, gameplay, and expanded plot lines said to &quot;cast a new light on the overarching narrative&quot; as players face &quot;spine-chilling madness that extends over generations.&quot;


The first Layers of Fear game, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, charted the story of a painter on the verge of completing his masterpiece while Layers of Fear 2 told the tale of an actor making a movie onboard a labyrinthine ocean liner, with both games serving up some striking psychedelic imagery as each protagonist began to lose their grip on reality.

Theatre Commander presents turn-based grand-strategy gameplay as you direct the deployment of forces, perform research and manage your resources across the Western Front.

                              <span>An intriguing-sounding psychological thriller called The Gap was announced during the Future Games Show this evening.
It&#x27;s described as a hard sci-fi first-person narrative game set in 2045, not that the sci-fi elements are particularly apparent from the debut trailer. This shows you, a neuroscientist called Joshua Hayes, waking up on the floor of presumably your own apartment, with a voice - and written messages on the walls - telling you not to trust anyone. But you can&#x27;t remember what is going on.
Hayes suffers from a rare genetic disorder that affects his memory, so the focus in the game is trying to recover those memories by re-experiencing them. The catalyst for this is déjà vu, triggered by objects that act like a bridge to a parallel reality to experience memories again. But there&#x27;s tragedy hiding in your past, too.

Build A Rocket Boy, which is based in Edinburgh, currently lists three positions based on blockchain development on its website, including a senior backend programmer, smart contract developer and test engineer.


Is Everywhere a blockchain game? Does it include NFTs? What, actually, is Everywhere? These questions were all floating around the internet this morning, after a particularly vague reveal for the game last night during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live ceremony, where we saw a trailer for the title that gave little away.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we&#x27;re picking out our favourite bits - and not so favourites - from this week&#x27;s big Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase. 

It&#x27;s a relatively quiet year for Gamescom - though it is lovely to see the show back on its feet and filled with sweaty attendees - and it&#x27;s fair to say this was reflected in last night&#x27;s showings. We got a big reveal for Dead Island 2 - which is not set on an island - and a release date for Return to Monkey Island, but otherwise, surprises were thin on the ground, and there were a lot of CGI trailers.


Those aside, and ignoring Kojima shilling his podcast, we still got an array of interesting games to look forward to over the next 12 months, even if not all of them were AAA-sized or from franchises you might have heard of. I particularly liked the look of Moonbreaker, Atlus Fallen and Where Winds Meet, games I&#x27;d never heard of before last night. But what did everyone else think? Tom Phillips, Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan discuss.

Chatting to Bloomberg, Spencer stated that platform exclusives are something we were all going to see &quot;less and less of&quot; in future, as he hopes for an industry that encourages people to feel safe and included &quot;regardless of what device&quot; they play on.


Spencer said he also wanted to see more cross-play possibilties on the market. &quot;Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox and I buy a PlayStation and our kids want to play together and they can&#x27;t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television,&quot; he explained.

                              <span>The company behind controversial anti-piracy software Denuvo has announced an &quot;innovative solution&quot; to the piracy of Nintendo Switch games on PC.
Irdeto today published a press release about its Nintendo Switch Emulator Protection solution, as a call to developers and publishers who may be interested in including it with their games. In its statement, Irdeto targets not only first-party and second-party Switch games, but ports of PC games too.

&quot;Nintendo consoles have long suffered from piracy issues and the Switch is no different,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;Even if a game is protected against piracy on its PC version, the released version on Switch can be emulated from day one and played on PC, therefore bypassing the strong protections offered on the PC version.&quot;

                              <span>The August update for Gran Turismo 7 is now available, adding a legendary F1 car.


The McLaren MP4/4 marked the end of the Turbo era and was driven by Ayrton Senna in 1988 to win the drivers&#x27; championship. It&#x27;s now available to drive in-game.


Three other cars have also been included: the Pontiac GTO &#x27;The Judge&#x27; &#x27;69, the Porsche Cayman GT4 &#x27;16, and the De Tomaso Mangusta (Christian Dior).

                              <span>Bungie has announced it will ditch its practice of ritually shedding past Destiny 2 expansions.


No content will be lost from expansions from this point forward, Bungie pledged last night during its packed Destiny 2 announcement livestream.


However, the game&#x27;s fabled Content Vault will still continue to gobble up some stuff, including season content beyond its expansion&#x27;s launch year.

                              <span>In its first Community Update, Techland has revealed changes coming to Dying Light 2 Stay Human.


So far the improvements are mainly visual. A new Colour Grading option has been added that allows players to change to a &quot;gritty&quot; look similar to the 2019 gameplay presentations.


Other visual improvements include new screen space ambient occlusion implementation, image clarity improvements including temporal anti-aliasing and texture filtering, and the ability to toggle Chromatic Aberration.

                              <span>Toge Productions, the Indonesian indie developer behind Coffee Talk, has today issued a damning statement announcing a delay to its next project due to issues with publisher PQube.


The lengthy public announcement, made this morning via Twitter, accuses PQube of misusing money gained from a diversity fund. Toge Productions claims it should have received this money - part of a scheme from a &quot;well known console platform&quot; - to help finance its upcoming project A Space For The Unbound.


&quot;The diversity fund was a grant fund intended to help underrepresented game developers, especially during the pandemic,&quot; Toge Productions wrote. &quot;However, instead of giving those funds to the developers as the grant was intended, PQube Games intentionally withheld information about the grant and used it as a leverage for their own commercial gain.

                              <span>A swanky new gaming feature announced by Amazon at Gamescom will let you interact with Dead Island 2 using your voice. This feature is known as Alexa Game Control, and it pretty much does what it says on the tin. 


With Alexa Game Control in use, players will be able to control aspects of their game via Amazon&#x27;s voice activated software. Amazon states that the feature will work with &quot;any microphone or headset connected to their PC or console,&quot; and therefore &quot;players do not need an Echo device to play games with their voice&quot;. You will, however, need an Amazon account (but not necessarily a Prime one).


Along with this announcement, Amazon also revealed how this new feature will be implemented in Dambuster Studios&#x27; upcoming zombie slasher, Dead Island 2.

It is also built and maintained by many individuals, all of them with different skills, experiences, histories, and interests, who join forces not just as the release team but as the many SIGs that support the project and the community year-round.

                              <span>After two games of terrifying deep sea survival, Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds is heading in a very different direction for its next project - a tabletop-inspired turn-based tactics game going by the name Moonbreaker, entering Steam early access on 29th September.


On a fundamental level, Moonbreaker, which has been in development for around five years, is surprisingly straightforward; each game sees players - either working against a human or AI opponent - strategising their way around a board, using careful positioning to their advantage as they work to annihilate the opposing player&#x27;s Captain.


So far so straightforward, but the complexity arrives when you begin factoring in the tactical options available to players during a match, including the likes of cover - which can either impenetrable or penetrable with an accuracy cost - plus Captains, crew members, ship assists, and resource management.

                              <span>Atlas Fallen is a new fantasy action RPG from The Surge developer Deck 13, set for release on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2023.


We got a first look at Atlas Fallen tonight during Gamescom Opening Night Live, via a flashy CGI trailer which shows off its sand-covered semi-open world and superpowered beasties.


Stick with the trailer - not that it isn&#x27;t easy on the eyes - and there&#x27;s a glimpse of what looks like actual gameplay right at the end.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima - the man behind the likes of Death Stranding, Metal Gear Solid, and PT - has once again popped up at the German Geoffs (AKA Gamescom Opening Night Live) for a bit of the old self-promotion, this time to announce a new podcast series known as Brain Structure.


Brain Structure, which will launch as a Spotify exclusive starting in September, appears to be seperate from Kojima&#x27;s Japan-only Radioverse podcast, which began in February and promised to bring listeners a variety of guests discussing &quot;deep topics related to games and movies that cannot be heard anywhere else&quot;.


This new Spotify podcast seems broadly similar in nature though, featuring appearances from &quot;very special guests from various fields&quot;, including, perhaps inevitably, Geoff Keighely, who&#x27;ll have his own regular entertainment news section.

Flashy footage from the game gave us our first proper look at Harley Quinn, who looks to be a major antagonist for Gotham Knights&#x27; four heroes, alongside Mr Freeze, Clayface and the Court of Owls. 


The trailer concluded with the reveal of a new launch date: 21st October, four days earlier than previously planned.

The developers have said that this new game will be unlike any previous Telltale titles, thanks to the introduction of &quot;several new gameplay elements&quot;.

                              <span>Jeff Gardiner, a Bethesda veteran of 15 years and most recently the project lead on Fallout 76, has announced a new studio and open-world occult RPG with it.
The studio is Something Wicked Games and the project is Wyrdsong, pronounced &quot;weirdsong&quot;, or at least that&#x27;s how Gardiner pronounced it on a phone call to me. It&#x27;s going to be set in Portugal around the forming of the Knights Templar.
Something Wicked was co-founded with Obsidian veteran Charles Staples in April this year, who led design on Outer Worlds. And the studio is funded by NetEase courtesy of a $13.2m &quot;seed&quot; investment, which means it&#x27;s not all the money Something Wicked will need but a wadge to get going with.

And that trailer has it all: giant robots, cute companion robots, creepy young child robots, and the return of Amy Rose who appears to have been kidnapped. Check it out below.

                              <span>Funcom has released a first cinematic trailer for Dune: Awakening, a new &quot;open-world survival MMO&quot; inspired by Frank Herbert&#x27;s novels and Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s Academy Award-winning film, that&#x27;s heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.


Dune: Awakening was first teased back in 2019, when Funcom announced it had signed a deal with Legendary Studios to make &quot;at least&quot; three games set in Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune universe. One of those eventually turned out to be Dune: Spice Wars and the other, described as an &quot;open-world multiplayer game&quot; from Funcom Oslo, we can now call Dune: Awakening.


Today&#x27;s announcement doesn&#x27;t bring any gameplay, but Funcom says it&#x27;ll combine the &quot;grittiness and creativity of survival games with the social interactivity of large-scale, persistent multiplayer games&quot; in a &quot;vast and seamless Arrakis shared by thousands of players&quot;.

You can preorder the game now (it is listed for £19.49 on Steam) and in doing so get yourself some new horse armour for your piratical inventory.
Along with this news, delivered by Stan, of course, there was also tropical music a plenty, colourful set pieces, and a good dose of banter. You can see what you think for yourself below.

                              <span>Ahead of its release this December, we have been given another, gory, teaser for The Callisto Protocol. 


Debuted at Gamescom Opening Night Live, this new footage is as bloody and unpleasant as you would expect. There are mutations getting shoved into rotors, there is blood splattering the surfaces left, right and centre, and there are those kinds of noises that you do not want to ever hear when you are home alone at night (or any time for that matter). 


As well as the standard shooting and squelching, we also get to see some Tomb Raider-esque slipping and sliding down a water way. Of course, there are things to avoid, so this can only end well... See what you think to it all for yourself below.

                              <span>Following on from a leak earlier this month, Gearbox has officially unveiled its upcoming game, New Tales from the Borderlands. As we sort of already knew, it is coming on 21st October across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam and Epic).


This standalone, choice based, narrative is set in the &quot;perpetually war-torn Promethea&quot; and will see players deciding the fates of &quot;three underdogs out to make mayhem in their business&quot;. And what of these underdogs? Well, they are altruistic scientist Anu (pictured above), her ambitious &quot;streetwise&quot; brother Octavio, and the fierce, frogurt-flinging Fran.


You can see the trailer, which was shown during Gamescom Opening Night Live, for New Tales from the Borderlands below.

Lightfall, which was initially announced back in June 2020, will be Destiny 2&#x27;s penultimate expansion, coming between this year&#x27;s The Witch Queen and the game&#x27;s finale expansion The Final Shape. As such, Bungie is calling it the &quot;beginning of the end&quot;, and it continues an escalating narrative that will bring Destiny&#x27;s Light and Darkness Saga to a close.


It finally gives a name and a face to Destiny 2&#x27;s much-teased big bad, The Witness, and will take players to Neptune&#x27;s capital city. This gleaming metropolis is, thanks to Calus&#x27; Shadow Legion, now Cabal-occupied territory, and players will need to deal with their new Pyramid-enhanced tech - including suppression devices, which can diminish Guardians&#x27; abilities - plus a new Pyramid unit known as the Tormentor.

An endless runner, the game looks to be a follow-up to Run Sackboy Run! - the PlayStation Vita and mobile game launched back in 2015.


While still formally unannounced by Sony, a Google Play listing for Ultimate Sackboy on Android is already visible - though curiously this dates back to June.

In a lengthy blog post, DICE has detailed how it will bring &quot;classes back to Battlefield&quot; by reintroducing the &quot;classic and familiar&quot; Assault, Recon, Support and Engineer as groups in which existing Specialists will sit as &quot;unique sub-classes&quot;.


Each of these classes will be tweaked to restrict gadget usage, enabling players to &quot;better assess the threat&quot;, and assign new class traits.

Previously, streamers who reach Partner status on the platform were tied to only livestreaming on Twitch.


Now Twitch Partners are also able to stream on rival platforms like YouTube and Facebook too, although simulcasting is not allowed there.

Nagoshi, known as the father of the Super Monkey Ball and Yakuza series, left Sega in 2021 after 32 years at the company to join Chinese technology company NetEase. He later announced Nagoshi Studio, a subsidiary under NetEase Games, which would allow him to &quot;do something different&quot;.
In an interview with German gaming site 4Players, Nagoshi said it had not been creative differences that had led him to leave Sega, but that during his last few years at the company he was promoted to executive and management roles - something he wasn&#x27;t interested in.

                              <span>Disappointing Saints Row reviews have hit publisher Embracer&#x27;s stock price.

                              <span>It turns out Elden Ring character Goldmask does in fact have a voice line after all.


The character is a mere husk of a man with a golden mask on his face. He&#x27;s so enlightened he doesn&#x27;t ever speak and instead just points towards the towering Erdtree with a &quot;...&quot;.


Except, thanks to datamining, he does actually have a voice line hidden away in the Network Test version of the game.

We were expecting to see more of Sonic Frontiers at Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live ceremony tonight. Instead, a Japanese trailer briefly popped up this morning - though it has now been pulled offline.

Regardless, the internet never forgets. And, as shared by Nibel, the 8th November release date is now out in the wild.

Here’s what our users need to know:
All users can rest assured that their message history, contact lists, profile information, whom they’d blocked, and other personal data remain private and secure and were not affected.
For about 1,900 users, an attacker could have attempted to re-register their number to another device or learned that their number was registered to Signal. This attack has since been shut down by Twilio. 1,900 users is a very small percentage of Signal’s total users, meaning that most were not affected...</span>

                              <span>Minecraft&#x27;s default player skin Steve has finally regrown its original beard, after 13 years.


Developer Mojang has updated the character designs for both Steve and Alex for the first time in over a decade. The changes add extra 3D elements to both of their blocky models - and return Steve&#x27;s OG face fuzz.


Steve&#x27;s beard was lost back in 2009, as part of a move to make Minecraft&#x27;s default skin more gender-neutral. It wasn&#x27;t until 2014 that the ponytailed Alex made an appearance.

                              <span>Another Monday, another Return to Monkey Island clip for us all to pore over.


The latest clip from creator Ron Gilbert shows the game&#x27;s new streamlined UI, with prompts appearing on-screen as hero Guybrush Threepwood explores the Scumm Bar on Melee Island.


When the cursor moves across the screen in this clip, messages such as &quot;Time to talk to the pirate leaders&quot; and &quot;Smells good in there&quot; pop up. The interactions shown do not appear intrusive, and seem to offer a clever way of keeping the story moving along.

No really - she&#x27;s beaten all Remembrances with just one hand and at level one.


And that includes the formidable Malenia.

The project will adapt one of the best early Tintin comic books, from a time when the young reporter (and Snowy the dog) were not yet accompanied by sidekick Captain Haddock. 


The project - developed by Madrid-based adventure game maker Pendulo Studios, and published by French company Microids - was first mentioned by Microids back in April 2020, before all went quiet. We&#x27;ve been waiting to hear more ever since. Now, here&#x27;s a teaser trailer:

Plazas and Promenades - the 11th major expansion for developer Colossal Order&#x27;s acclaimed city builder - brings a new pedestrianisation focus to the game, giving budding urban planners the tools needed to add pedestrian-only streets, pedestrian zones, and zone-specific policies.


The latter include the likes of Slow Driving (which implements a 20mph speed limit for all non-highway roads within a pedestrian zone), Sugar Ban (which increases citizen lifespan at the expense of happiness), and Music (increasing happiness but also increasing noise pollution).

                              <span>Ubisoft has denied reports it is making a game based on Marvel&#x27;s infamous vampire hunter Blade. 


The reports were sparked by photos - originally posted to Instagram back in July - that showed actors in Ubisoft-branded mo-cap suits apparently working on a Marvel project.


The images resurfaced yesterday thanks to YouTuber and regular Ubisoft leaker JorRaptor, who pointed out a clapperboard which listed director Bassam Tariq - who is also directing Marvel&#x27;s 2023 Blade reboot.

Sorrenti posted a video after the event describing how she was &quot;terrorised&quot; by police when they arrived at her home with assault rifles.


She&#x27;s since moved to a hotel but has now been doxxed by a transphobic hate group known as Kiwi Farms.

As noted by The Verge, WordleBot now lists &#x27;Slate&#x27; as the optimal starting word. 


Previously, &#x27;Crane&#x27; was the New York Times&#x27; favourite starting suggestion, however this has been given the boot in favour of the &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;T&#x27; inclusive &#x27;Slate&#x27;. This makes sense, as &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;T&#x27; are two of the most commonly occurring letters throughout our dictionary.

                              <span>Over the weekend, we got a look at a brand new Pokémon. 
This new addition is Cyclizar, and it was featured as part of a new trailer for the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, shown during the closing ceremony of this year&#x27;s Pokémon World Championships. 
The trailer, which you can watch below, shows Cyclizar with motorbike-esque appendages that are very similar to fellow bipedal reptile-like legendary Koraidon. It also shows off a new move called &quot;Shed Tail&quot;, which allows players to create a substitute and then &quot;swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting&quot;.

                              <span>Discounts on energy bills will reportedly be offered to UK households which avoid electricity usage during peak times.


This could mean rebates for those who avoid using consumer goods such as computers and games consoles between the hours of 5pm and 8pm each evening, BBC News wrote.


The scheme is reportedly being planned by the National Grid electricity system operator (ESO) for those with smart meters, with full details to be set out in the next two weeks after consultation with energy companies and UK regulator Ofgem.

                              <span>Sony is being sued for £5bn, accused of &quot;ripping people off&quot; on its online store.


The legal claim is led by ex-managing director of Which UK Alex Neill and was filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal last week.


It claims by charging a 30 percent commission on digital games and in-game purchases on the PlayStation Store, Sony is in breach of competition law.

Bungie is yet to confirm the collaboration, which seems likely to be made official tomorrow night during its big Destiny 2 livestream.

                              <span>A developer from the original Grand Theft Auto game has reportedly had prototype videos hit with a copyright strike from Rockstar Games.


Mike Dailly, one of the founders of DMA Design (now Rockstar North), has tweeted he&#x27;s removed any GTA videos due to the strikes.


&quot;I see Rockstar are going full fuckers mode again, issuing copyright strikes to any GTA video they can find - including both my prototype videos. So now they&#x27;re trying to block all release of anyone&#x27;s work on a game - and any old development footage,&quot; he tweeted yesterday.

                              <span>We now have our first look at HBO&#x27;s upcoming adaptation of The Last of Us.


Shared as part of a collection of teasers for the service&#x27;s new season, this clip was brief but enticing. It comes with the obligatory dramatic music as it shows us snippets of Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel running through the streets with someone who I won&#x27;t name to avoid spoilers, Bella Ramsay as Ellie and Nick Offerman as Bill. While we don&#x27;t see any of the series&#x27; infected enemies, we do get a brief snap of some fungal like spores on a wall, hinting at the devastation the world is in. 


The entire HBO clip, which can be seen below, also gives us small teasers for shows such as The Idol, Doom Patrol and Pennyworth. However, if you want to jump straight to The Last of Us, that begins at around the 1:43 mark.

“Turns out the [AES] encryption key in that script is the first AES 128-bit CBC example key listed in the NIST document SP800-38A [PDF]”.

Luck held out, in a way. “Greenluigi1” found within the firmware image the RSA public key used by the updater, and searched online for a portion of that key. The search results pointed to a common public key that shows up in online tutorials like “...</span>

Since the very beginning of Kubernetes, the topic of persistent data and how to address the requirement of stateful applications has been an important topic. Support for stateless deployments was natural, present from the start, and garnered attention, becoming very well-known. Work on better support for stateful applications was also present from early on, with each release increasing the scope of what could be run on Kubernetes.
Message queues, databases, clustered filesystems: these are some examples of the solutions that have different storage requirements and that are, today, increasingly deployed in Kubernetes. Dealing with ephemeral and persistent storage, local or remote, file or block, from many different vendors, while considering how to provide the …</span>

                              <span>MultiVersus has knocked Elden Ring off the top spot of the month&#x27;s best-selling games.

NPD Group reports (thanks, NME) that despite being free-to-play - albeit with in-game purchases - MultiVersus is the highest-grossing game of July 2022, due in part to its Founder Packs promotion. 

It may not sound like a particularly impressive feat but to put it into perspective, since its release in February, Elden Ring has been the best-selling game every month but one.

The video also showcases how the team worked alongside the BWT Alpine F1 Team to capture a real F1 pit stop, which you will see &quot;brought to life in the game&quot;.

It&#x27;s a fascinating glimpse into how games are made, and the lengths developers go to to try and create an authentic sim experience. Check it out below:

                              <span>It looks like Ubisoft+ - Ubisoft&#x27;s own game subscription service - may finally be on the way to Xbox.

Up until now, Ubisoft+ has only been available to players on PC, but a service that scrapes Xbox&#x27;s backend and spotted by our friends at VGC has reportedly found an Ubisoft+ logo in the system, hinting that Ubisoft+ may be coming soon.

A prior announcement confirmed that Ubisoft+ - unlike EA Play - would not be part of Xbox Game Pass, and this is unlikely to have changed, particularly as a cut-down version of the Ubisoft sub, Ubisoft+ Classics, is available within the upper tiers of Sony&#x27;s rival PS Plus. We&#x27;ll have to wait until we get a formal announcement to confirm that either way, though.

Though details are light - more will be revealed in an upcoming livestream set for 21st August - we do learn more about new a 1 Health and 3 Speed Attacker Grim, a Singaporean with one goal: &quot;to get the job done&quot;.

&quot;Grim&#x27;s experience in the EOD taught him how easily things can blow up when a target&#x27;s position and proximity is unknown,&quot; Ubisoft teases in a blog update. &quot;That&#x27;s where the Kawan Hive Launcher comes in, with no reload and a low fire rate the launcher allows for versatile gameplay, using Intel-Gathering and Area Denial to counter roamers, make entry, and protect objectives.

                              <span>Sega is giving two more of its classic titles the movie treatment: Space Channel 5 and Comix Zone.

No doubt inspired by the runaway success of the Sonic movies, Sega looks set to adapt the two games alongside Picturestart, which is also working on the upcoming Borderlands movie (which is seemingly now in post-production).

Dance game Space Channel 5 will be retitled Channel 5 and, according to Hollywood Reporter, &quot;tell the story of a hapless fast-food worker who is recruited by a freedom reporter from the future to save the world from aliens using the one thing that unites all people on the planet: our love of silly viral dances&quot;.

                              <span>Netflix is looking to &quot;rapidly expand&quot; the &quot;new gaming offerings&quot; available on its cloud gaming service.

That&#x27;s according to a new job advertisement put out by the company that seeks a new senior software engineer with &quot;experience with game development&quot;.

As well as finding someone with all the necessary coding skills, Netflix hopes the new recruit will also have some experience in &quot;Unity or Unreal game engines&quot; and says it is &quot;rapidly expanding new gaming offerings&quot; on its global streaming service.

&quot;An NPC by which players may voluntarily return the deposit they were accidentally refunded has been added,&quot; the update states, above an image of three cute apology posters starring Namazu and Lalafell.

                              <span>The jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus gigas) uses its color-changing ability as a language:
In 2020, however, marine biologists discovered that jumbo flying squid are surprisingly coordinated. Despite their large numbers, the squid rarely bumped into each other or competed for the same prey. The scientists hypothesized that the flickering pigments allowed the squid to quickly communicate complex messages, such as when it was preparing to attack and what it was targeting.
The researchers observed that the squid displayed 12 distinct pigmentation patterns in a variety of sequences, similar to how humans arrange words in a sentence. For example, squid darkened while pursuing prey and then shifted to a half light/half dark pattern immediately before striking. The researchers hypothesized that these whole-body pigment changes signaled a precise action, such as “I’m about to attack.”...</span>

                              <span>The USB Rubber Ducky is getting better and better.
Already, previous versions of the Rubber Ducky could carry out attacks like creating a fake Windows pop-up box to harvest a user’s login credentials or causing Chrome to send all saved passwords to an attacker’s webserver. But these attacks had to be carefully crafted for specific operating systems and software versions and lacked the flexibility to work across platforms.
The newest Rubber Ducky aims to overcome these limitations. It ships with a major upgrade to the DuckyScript programming language, which is used to create the commands that the Rubber Ducky will enter into a target machine. While previous versions were mostly limited to writing keystroke sequences, DuckyScript 3.0 is a feature-rich language, letting users write functions, store variables, and use logic flow controls (i.e., if this… then that)...</span>

The one thing that unifies them, no matter their differences, are that they all have an interesting story. It is my pleasure to be the documentarian for the stories of the Kubernetes community in the weekly Kubernetes Podcast from Google. With every new Kubernetes release comes an interview with the release team lead, telling the story of that release, but also their own personal story.

                              <span>This vulnerability was reported to Zoom last December:
The exploit works by targeting the installer for the Zoom application, which needs to run with special user permissions in order to install or remove the main Zoom application from a computer. Though the installer requires a user to enter their password on first adding the application to the system, Wardle found that an auto-update function then continually ran in the background with superuser privileges.
When Zoom issued an update, the updater function would install the new package after checking that it had been cryptographically signed by Zoom. But a bug in how the checking method was implemented meant that giving the updater any file with the same name as Zoom’s signing certificate would be enough to pass the test—so an attacker could substitute any kind of malware program and have it be run by the updater with elevated privilege...</span>

                              <span>This is more of a demonstration than a real-world vulnerability, but researchers can use electromagnetic interference to remotely control touchscreens.
From a news article:
It’s important to note that the attack has a few key limitations. Firstly, the hackers need to know the target’s phone passcode, or launch the attack while the phone is unlocked. Secondly, the victim needs to put the phone face down, otherwise the battery and motherboard will block the electromagnetic signal. Thirdly, the antenna array has to be no more than four centimeters (around 1.5 inches) away. For all these reasons the researchers themselves admit that the “invisible finger” technique is a proof of concept that at this point is far from being a threat outside of a university lab.  ...</span>

                              <span>Scammers were able to convince YouTube that other peoples’ music was their own. They successfully stole $23 million before they were caught.
No one knows how common this scam is, and how much money total is being stolen in this way. Presumably this is not an uncommon fraud.
While the size of the heist and the breadth of the scheme may be very unique, it’s certainly a situation that many YouTube content creators have faced before. YouTube’s Content ID system, meant to help creators, has been weaponized by bad faith actors in order to make money off content that isn’t theirs. While some false claims are just mistakes caused by automated systems, the MediaMuv case is a perfect example of how fraudsters are also purposefully taking advantage of digital copyright rules...</span>

Hello, everyone 👋
Welcome back to the third edition of the &quot;Meet Our Contributors&quot; blog post series for APAC.
This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project.
So, without further ado, let&#x27;s get straight to the article.

As Kubernetes grows and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with improvements for the health of the project. Kubernetes v1.25 includes several major changes and one major removal.
The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed.

Introduction
The official documentation is the go-to source for any open source project. For Kubernetes,
it&#x27;s an ever-evolving Special Interest Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in their efforts
to make details about the project easier to consume for new contributors and users. SIG Docs publishes
the official documentation on kubernetes.io which includes,
