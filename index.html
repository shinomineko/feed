In a lot of ways, its business as usual for Disgaea 6; once again, the series conjures up a ridiculous, comedic yarn to frame its strategy action - this time focusing on new protagonist Zed, a teenage zombie on a quest to defeat the God of Destruction - all in service to the series&#x27; wonderfully compelling turn-based battling and drive for ever-higher numbers.

The mod in question is Rise of Mordor, and it has been around for eons. And yet, in the same week that the Lord of the Rings film and game rights have also happened to go up for sale, Warner Bros has issued a DMC takedown claim to its developers. Interesting timing.

The change follows the publication&#x27;s purchase of the puzzler for a seven-figure sum, and has seen it transfer onto the New York Times website. (The old link will now autodirect for existing players.) The game&#x27;s logo has also been redesigned.

                    <span>An elderly woman who was held hostage in her home has said she was saved by Wordle, after she failed to send her daughter her usual attempt at the daily puzzle.
A 32-year-old man from Lincolnwood, Illinois was arrested by police after they were called to do a wellness check at the woman&#x27;s home.

Joining me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s reporting team of Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Ishraq Subhan, chatting about the whopping 48 tracks coming to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, plus new Fire Emblem, Xenoblade Chronicles and Wii Sports (which yes, does include Miis).

                    <span>A detailed report of the 2021 ransomware attack against Ireland’s Health Services Executive lists some really bad security practices:
The report notes that:
The HSE did not have a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or a “single responsible owner for cybersecurity at either senior executive or management level to provide leadership and direction.
It had no documented cyber incident response runbooks or IT recovery plans (apart from documented AD recovery plans) for recovering from a wide-scale ransomware event.
Under-resourced Information Security Managers were not performing their business as usual role (including a NIST-based cybersecurity review of systems) but were working on evaluating security controls for the COVID-19 vaccination system. Antivirus software triggered numerous alerts after detecting Cobalt Strike activity but these were not escalated. (The antivirus server was later encrypted in the attack).

                    <span>Never Alone - the acclaimed puzzle-platform adventure inspired by a traditional story told by the Iñupiat, an Alaska Native people - is getting a sequel, and the original game will be making its way to Switch in an all-new bundle on 24th February.
The first Never Alone (also known as Kisima Ingitchuna) launched back in 2014, and its tale of an Iñupiat girl named Nuna and her Arctic fox searching for the source of a eternal blizzard to save their village from starvation went on to receive numerous accolades, including winning the BAFTA Games Awards&#x27; Best Debut Game in 2015.

                    <span>Riot Games has shared an update on its ongoing efforts to combat voice and chat toxicity in its free-to-play shooter Valorant, pledging that harsher, more immediate punishments for abusers - and its previously announced voice recording moderation system - are on the way.
Riot initially outlined the areas it would be focusing on to combat unwanted player behaviour in Valorant - which included repeated AFK offences as well as those related to toxic comms use - in a blog post last year. The developer has now offered an update on its progress, highlighting some of the new steps it will be implementing in a bid to make for a more pleasant player experience in the near future.

Activision Blizzard has, of course, been the focus of months of disturbing allegations surrounding its workplace culture following the launch of a State of California lawsuit calling the company a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - made all the more unsettling after a damning Wall Street Journal report claimed Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick had been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company &quot;for years&quot;.

If A Highland Song looks familiar, that might be because Inkle hasn&#x27;t been particularly secretive about its latest project, sharing some of its early production work on the title via regular updates on its blog. Today, however, marks its official unveiling, bringing with it an immediately arresting, wonderfully evocative reveal trailer.

Salt and Sacrifice, as is amply evident from its release date trailer below, reprises much that made the original so good, serving up another deliciously gloomy slab of side-scrolling exploratory platforming and measured combat. It promises to be more than a retread of past glories, however, offering players - this time in the role of a Marked Inquisitor - a range of new features to experiment with, including a refreshed choice of classes: Highblade, Paladin, Assassin, Cleric, Dualist, Fighter, Ranger, and Sage.

The QR code - again, visible at the 55 seconds mark in Nintendo&#x27;s trailer broadcast last night and available on YouTube - certainly exists. However, the ability to scan it is being hampered by the code&#x27;s size and the video&#x27;s quality.

However, fans have been left disappointed, as many are currently unable to gain access to its single player campaign developed by Alan Wake maker Remedy. Microsoft is aware of this issue and has shared it is working to fix it. At the time of writing, its status is currently close to being resolved.

This latest trailer keeps the tone of previous teasers for the game - think Bioshock meets the USSR. With a robot uprising, an experimental polymer glove and an array of psychedelic scenes, it is hard to look away.

                    <span>Bunnie Huang has created a Plausibly Deniable Database.
Most security schemes facilitate the coercive processes of an attacker because they disclose metadata about the secret data, such as the name and size of encrypted files. This allows specific and enforceable demands to be made: “Give us the passwords for these three encrypted files with names A, B and C, or else…”. In other words, security often focuses on protecting the confidentiality of data, but lacks deniability.
A scheme with deniability would make even the existence of secret files difficult to prove. This makes it difficult for an attacker to formulate a coherent demand: “There’s no evidence of undisclosed data. Should we even bother to make threats?” A lack of evidence makes it more difficult to make specific and enforceable demands...</span>

                    <span>As promised in rather more general terms back in December, Square Enix&#x27;s latest Final Fantasy pixel remaster - which this time focuses on Final Fantasy 6 - will launch this month. However, the publisher has now supplemented that previous news with some welcome specifics, confirming its fancied-up Final Fantasy 6 will arrive on Steam and mobile devices on 23rd February.
&quot;The War of the Magi caused magic to disappear from the world,&quot; explains Square Enix in its brisk summary of Final Fantasy 6&#x27;s plot over on the pixel remaster&#x27;s Steam page. &quot;A thousand years later, humanity relies on machines - until they find a young woman with mysterious powers...All the playable characters have their own stories, goals, and destinies. Journey through their interwoven fates in this sweeping melodrama.&quot;

                    <span>We didn&#x27;t get a firm release date for Splatoon 3 during tonight&#x27;s big Nintendo Direct, but we did get an inkling of a launch window: this summer, of 2022.
Tonight&#x27;s show also brought a fresh look at Next Wave, the new instalment of the series&#x27; Salmon Run co-op mode, which now features a giant new Salmonid to shoot your inky paint at. Here&#x27;s the trailer:

                    <span>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was announced during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct.
The next instalment in the Xenoblade series will &quot;tie together the futures of the worlds depicted in Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;. How exactly it will do this remains to be seen, but the footage so far looks undeniably beautiful, with hints that it will be more similar in style to the first game.

                    <span>The excellent Metroid Dread will get both easier and hard today, via a free update which adds fresh difficulty modes. 
Dread Mode is basically a one-hit-kill affair, where even the slightest knock will down Samus for good. Rookie Mode, meanwhile, will offer you &quot;increased recovery&quot; for an easier ride.

                    <span>Nintendo has finally remembered that making Mario Kart DLC is a thing it can do and a thing we (or I, at least) would very much like; to that end, it will be bringing a whopping 48 new courses to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as paid DLC, starting on 18th March.
These 48 courses will be pulled from all across the Mario Kart series, with each track being remastered to imbue it with some of that glorious Mario Kart 8 polish - and if Nintendo&#x27;s previous Mario Kart DLC efforts are any indication, these will be some glorious things indeed.

It&#x27;s certainly an ambitious undertaking given the Switch&#x27;s comparative limitations and the generally demanding nature of No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s procedural core, and Hello admits the project - which a small team at the studio has been &quot;secretly working on&quot; for the last couple of years - has been a &quot;real moonshot&quot;.

This mode will allow Kirby to inhale and then embody everyday objects around him during his quest to save the imprisoned Waddle Dees. Yes, this means Kirby will be able to inhale a car, and then corporally drive around the environment. He will also be able to inhale vending machines, and then use its contents to attack his foes.

Nintendo Switch Sports sees three classic sports returning - Tennis, Bowling and Chambara. You&#x27;ll also be able to play three new games: Soccer (Football), which uses a giant ball, just like real soccer (football), Badminton, which will please friend of Eurogamer Ed Thorn, and Volleyball. I don&#x27;t know why I capitalised all the sports but it&#x27;s too late to change that now.

                    <span>Mario Strikers - Nintendo&#x27;s much-loved, but long-absent football game - is finally making a return on 10th June, in the form of Mario Strikers: Battle League for Switch.
The first series entry, Super Mario Strikers (also known as Mario Smash Football in Europe), initially launched for GameCube all the way back in 2005, foisting a typically Nintendo spin on the beloved sport. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the game, think a Mario Golf or Mario Tennis style makeover - replete with game-changing items and ludicrous special attacks - but 5v5 football action, and you&#x27;re pretty much there.

Familiar faces return in this new story set in the Three Houses world (similar to how Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity expanded on Breath of the Wild, perhaps?). It&#x27;s set to launch for Nintendo Switch on 24th June 2022.

Re-Boot Camp includes both Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. Both are absolute classics - brightly coloured turn-based gems that are fiercely replayable. The remake has a chunky 3D art style that a lot of people find hard to love, but it&#x27;s not the only new element, by the sounds of things. Nintendo also announced that the COs will now be voiced, you&#x27;ll be able to fast-forward gameplay and reset moves, and there are a handful of additional modes too.

The Wolf Among Us 2 has, of course, had an eventful journey to reach this point; the original game - a five-episode story-driven adventure based on Bill Willingham&#x27;s Fables comic book - released almost a decade ago in 2013 to much acclaim, and the demand for a sequel was immediate. The news fans had been waiting for eventually arrived in 2017, with confirmation The Wolf Among Us 2 was in development, but progress on the title regrettably halted after developer Telltale Games shut its doors the following year.

Now, however, in a lengthy blog post laying out a number of commitments as its acquisition bid goes through regulatory approval around the world, Microsoft has spoken of its exclusivity plans in its clearest terms yet.

                    <span>PlayStation has shared a snippet of Horizon Forbidden West running on an old-school base PS4.
By snippet, I really do mean snippet. The footage from PlayStation lasts a breezy 22 seconds and does not show any combat. Rather, it shows Aloy on a fairly sedate Shrine walk.

                    <span>Clearly having not read the room at all over the last few months, PUBG creator Krafton has announced it has &quot;entered a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Naver Z to develop a new Web 3.0 and non-fungible token (NFT) project&quot;. Sigh.
This project will be aimed at building an &quot;NFT metaverse platform&quot;, with Krafton using its experience of creating games such as PUBG to &quot;develop a user-generation content [UGC] creation tool&quot;. The company will use Unreal Engine to build a &quot;high-quality virtual world&quot;.

                    <span>The Commonwealth Games are traditionally a place for events such as gymnastics, weightlifting and athletics. However, that is all about to change in 2022 as esports will be added to the events program as well. 
The inclusion of esports at the upcoming Birmingham games will be known as the Commonwealth Esport Championships. This event will be a pilot, and therefore no medals will be awarded to the winners. There are hopes from the organisers, however, that this pilot will be successful, with the theory being it will draw in a younger audience to the games themselves.

                    <span>Researchers have calculated the quantum computer size necessary to break 256-bit elliptic curve public-key cryptography:
Finally, we calculate the number of physical qubits required to break the 256-bit elliptic curve encryption of keys in the Bitcoin network within the small available time frame in which it would actually pose a threat to do so. It would require 317 × 106 physical qubits to break the encryption within one hour using the surface code, a code cycle time of 1 μs, a reaction time of 10 μs, and a physical gate error of 10-3. To instead break the encryption within one day, it would require 13 × 10...</span>

                    <span>A rapidly growing number of Battlefield 2042 players have signed a petition demanding refunds for their purchase of EA&#x27;s troubled shooter, accusing the publisher of &quot;false advertising&quot; and of launching the game in an &quot;unplayable&quot; state.
It has, of course, been a bumpy few months for Battlefield 2042; just days after its release last November, the DICE-developed shooter gained the unenviable accolade of being one of Steam&#x27;s worst-reviewed games of all time. Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robinson was equally damning, going as far as to call its launch &quot;a disaster&quot;, writing, &quot;Since Battlefield 2042 went live on Friday, I&#x27;ve endured hard crashes, server problems and whole nights where the whole thing is simply unplayable...This is another Battlefield that&#x27;s launching in a sorry state.&quot;

                    <span>2022 so far: if you&#x27;re not being clobbered with an NFT, you&#x27;re being smacked in the chops by a metaverse, and the latest company to hop aboard the latter train is Bandai Namco, which is building a £96m virtual space where customers can experience &quot;entertainment on an IP axis&quot;.
As spotted by VGC, Bandai Namco made the announcement as part of its newly released mid-term plan spanning April 2022 to March 2025. In the document, the publisher introduces a new speech-bubble-inspired logo (said to express &quot;the potential of the brand to connect with people around the world through dreams, fun and inspiration&quot;) alongside an initial outline for what it&#x27;s calling its new &quot;IP axis strategy&quot;.

                    <span>A handful of teases and a couple of leaks later, EA has formally unveiled The Sims 4&#x27;s new wedding-themed Game Pack with first official details and a frankly adorable new trailer; it&#x27;s called My Wedding Stories and launches for PC and consoles next Thursday, 17th February.
The bulk of My Wedding Stories was accurately leaked at the tail-end of last week, but for those of you not perusing Eurogamer late into Friday night, the gist is that it gives players the tools needed to craft a surprisingly comprehensive wedding experience for their Sims - right from the proposal all the way through to vow renewals many years later.

                    <span>Only ten days remain until the launch of Guerrilla Games&#x27; highly anticipated open-world sequel Horizon Forbidden West, and, to mark its impending release, there&#x27;s a bit of cross-promotional collaboration action going on with another PlayStation-exclusive title: Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut now features Aloy-inspired armour, courtesy of its latest patch.
Update 2.15 brings a number of addtions to developer Sucker Punch&#x27;s Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut, but it&#x27;s the Horizon Forbidden West crossover that takes centre stage, giving players the opportunity to unlock a new outfit for Jin Sakai that has a distinct air of Aloy about it.

                    <span>There were sad faces all round when Microsoft announced Scalebound, its highly anticipated monster-bothering collaboration with Bayonetta developer PlatinumGames, had been cancelled, leaving fans of the studio to ponder what might have been if events had transpired differently. And it seems Platinum itself is still eager to see the project reach fruition, now saying it &quot;wants to discuss [its resurrection] with Microsoft properly&quot;.
Scalebound first surfaced during Microsoft&#x27;s E3 showcase back in 2014, promising to transport players to a hostile world where - in the role of a cocky teen with a massive sword - they&#x27;d take on enormous creatures, with a little help from their dragon pal.

                    <span>If you have played Bioshock Infinite&#x27;s Burial at Sea DLC you will have no doubt witnessed a boy dancing on the Parisian streets as he joyously holds a stick of French bread aloft (he is not exactly hard to miss). While a charming inclusion in its own right, the mastermind behind Bioshock&#x27;s &quot;Bread Boy&quot; has now revealed more insight into why he is there.
It was a simple fan post from Twitter user Pocklecool that once more brought &quot;Bread Boy&quot; back to the fore of our minds, commenting on the fact that the game&#x27;s shorthand for being in Paris was a small boy delightedly twirling a baguette in his arms. The tweet, perhaps understandably, blew up, catching the attention of Gwen Frey.

                    <span>Many Fortnite fans may be left disappointed, as it has been revealed that Epic&#x27;s battle royale will not be making a showing on Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck.
Tim Sweeney, founder and CEO of Epic Games, was recently asked by Twitter user Stormy178 if there were &quot;any plans to update [Fortnite] to make Proton/Wine be compatible with EAC and BattleEye anti-cheat on Linux?&quot;. To this, Sweeney replied with a swift no. He did, however, reiterate there is a &quot;big effort underway to maximize Easy Anti Cheat compatibility with Steam Deck&quot; (via PC Gamer).

                    <span>Amy Zegart has a new book: Spies, Lies, and Algorithms: The History and Future of American Intelligence. Wired has an excerpt:
In short, data volume and accessibility are revolutionizing sensemaking. The intelligence playing field is leveling­ — and not in a good way. Intelligence collectors are everywhere, and government spy agencies are drowning in data. This is a radical new world and intelligence agencies are struggling to adapt to it. While secrets once conferred a huge advantage, today open source information increasingly does. Intelligence used to be a race for insight where great powers were the only ones with the capabilities to access secrets. Now everyone is racing for insight and the internet gives them tools to do it. Secrets still matter, but whoever can harness all this data better and faster will win...</span>

Introduction
SIG Multicluster is the SIG focused on how Kubernetes concepts are expanded and used beyond the cluster boundary. Historically, Kubernetes resources only interacted within that boundary - KRU or Kubernetes Resource Universe (not an actual Kubernetes concept). Kubernetes clusters, even now, don&#x27;t really know anything about themselves or, about other clusters. Absence of cluster identifiers is a case in point. With the growing adoption of multicloud and multicluster deployments, the work SIG Multicluster doing is gaining a lot of attention. In this blog, Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google and Chris Short, AWS discuss the interesting problems SIG Multicluster is solving and how you can get involved. Their initials JOT and CS will be…</span>

                    <span>Despite originally launching back in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V remains a force to be reckoned with; according to Take-Two&#x27;s latest quarterly earnings report, Rockstar&#x27;s irrepressible open-world opus has managed to shift another 5m copies since November, bringing its lifetime sales up to 160m - and the publisher also had a little more to say about NFTs.
Alongside Grand Theft Auto V&#x27;s quarterly rise, Take-Two&#x27;s updated numbers show a continuing boost for the GTA series as a whole, which has now sold over 370 million units - an increase of 15m since November. However, as the publisher opted not to share sales data for its much-maligned GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, it&#x27;s unclear how much the troubled remaster contributed to that remaining 10m figure - although CEO Strauss Zelnick did say the game had &quot;significantly exceeded&quot; the company&#x27;s commercial expectations.

                    <span>Intellivision boss Tommy Tallarico has stepped down from the role of company CEO and will be replaced by former chief revenue officer Phil Adam.
Tallarico has served as Intellivision CEO since purchasing the legendary gaming brand in 2018, and his controversial tenure as CEO saw him oversee the development of the extremely troubled Amico console, which has been thrice-delayed since its original unveiling nearly four years ago, with still no sign of a launch in sight.

That&#x27;s according to Montreal-based French-language publication Le Devoir (via Google Translate), which sheds a little more light on Haven&#x27;s ambitions - with accompanying quotes from Raymond and fellow co-founders - as part of a short profile piece on the studio.

Originally releasing on the PlayStation 4 in 2016, The Tomorrow Children had a pretty rocky start. Unable to fully realise its potential as a free-to-play town-building, Soviet Union-themed, sandbox game, Sony shut down its servers a little over a year after its launch.

                    <span>Nearly eight years into the Sims 4&#x27;s life and the DLC show no sign of slowing. Following the arrival of this week&#x27;s vibrant Carnaval Streetwear Kit, a new leak has seemingly revealed extensive details on the life sim&#x27;s previously teased new wedding-themed Game Pack.
Suspicions were raised that a new wedding-focussed pack was coming back in January, when EA teased its upcoming Sims 4 content plans for the first three months of 2022. That reveal promised a &quot;game pack that throws a party for love&quot;, and fans&#x27; immediate thoughts of wedding bells now appear to have been by confirmed by a series of leaks on Twitter.

                    <span>Google has reportedly &quot;deprioritised&quot; its consumer-facing game streaming platform Stadia and now has a &quot;reduced interest&quot; in negotiating blockbuster titles for the service, having largely shifted its focus to selling the services&#x27; underlying technology to third-parties.
Stadia&#x27;s misfortunes are well-documented; despite initial praise for the service&#x27;s streaming capabilities at launch in 2019, a slow, problematic roll-out meant Google failed to capitalise on initial consumer interest. The extent of Stadia&#x27;s failings started to became clear when the company announced it was closing its first-party game development studios less that 14 months after launch, with subsequent reports claiming the streaming platform was missing its targets for monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.

                    <span>Co-op platformer It Takes Two was widely praised by critics when it launched last March, even managing to secure a place in many an end-of-year best-of list in 2021; more than that, though, it&#x27;s continued to resonate with players, and developer Hazelight Studios has now announced the game has surpassed the five million sales mark across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
It Takes Two, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, follows the adventures of Cody and May, a human couple preparing to divorce, who are forced to work together after being turned into living dolls. In gameplay terms, that translates to a wonderfully inventive split-screen platformer where careful co-operation is key. And while Eurogamer&#x27;s Robert Purchase had reservations about its story in his review, he was still charmed enough by its antics to call it &quot;a rare kind of co-op experience, with an energy and imagination and playfulness that sometimes rivals Nintendo&#x27;s.&quot;

The latest figures show that, even with a somewhat mixed bag of reviews, there is definitely enthusiasm for Techland&#x27;s zombie ridden, parkour powered brawl. On its launch, Dying Light 2 saw 160,202 concurrent players on Steam (via Benji Sales). To put this into perspective, that is 3.5 times that of Dying Light 1&#x27;s all-time peak, and 50 percent bigger than that of Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil Village.

The PIF purchased stakes of more than five percent in both Capcom and Nexon. This equates to a holding of more than $1bn across the two companies (via Bloomberg (paywall)). According to PIF, this move is based purely on an investment opportunity.

Across each division under the Activision Blizzard umbrella, there has been a fall in players. In December 2021, Activation saw its player count fall from 119m to 107m, while Blizzard&#x27;s numbers went from 26m to 24m. This follows a previous trend that saw the developer&#x27;s MAUs fall by 13 percent in November 2021.

                    <span>Senators have reintroduced the EARN IT Act, requiring social media companies (among others) to administer a massive surveillance operation on their users:
A group of lawmakers led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have re-introduced the EARN IT Act, an incredibly unpopular bill from 2020 that was dropped in the face of overwhelming opposition. Let’s be clear: the new EARN IT Act would pave the way for a massive new surveillance system, run by private companies, that would roll back some of the most important privacy and security features in technology used by people around the globe. It’s a framework for private actors to scan every message sent online and report violations to law enforcement. And it might not stop there.

                    <span>Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s long-running Warcraft franchise will be making its way to mobile later this year, according to a newly released quarterly earnings report from Activision.
As things currently stand, there&#x27;s not a lot of information to go on, with Activision only saying that Blizzard is &quot;planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022&quot; that will see it deliver &quot;all-new mobile Warcraft content into players&#x27; hands for the first time&quot;. The project is highlighted separately from World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, both of which will also be getting &quot;new experiences&quot; this year, according to Activision.

                    <span>Despite having been some considerable time ago now, Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks&#x27; Ghostwire: Tokyo has remained a bit of a hard one to pin down, with previous gameplay trailers leaving more questions than answers. Now, however, with the game finally sporting a 25th March release date on PlayStation 5 and PC, Sony has offered an extended look at its action in a new livestream showcase.
Tango Gameworks is calling Ghostwire: Tokyo a &quot;supernatural action-adventure thriller&quot;, and its story unfolds in an eerie, haunted version of Tokyo after nearly all the city&#x27;s population has mysteriously vanished. Players take on the role of Akito, a young man who awakens in a deserted Tokyo street to discover that strange elemental powers are coursing through his veins - soon revealed to be the work of a spirit known as KK who has possessed Akito&#x27;s body.

Far Cry 6&#x27;s paid post-launch content has focused its aciton on some of the series&#x27; most infamous villains, and Ubisoft is capping off its previous two DLCs, Vaas: Insanity and Pagan: Control - which built adventures around Far Cry 3&#x27;s Vaas Montenegro and Far Cry 4&#x27;s Pagan Min - with a final outing centred on Far Cry 5&#x27;s Joseph Seed.

                    <span>Risk of Rain 2&#x27;s Survivors of the Void paid expansion finally has a launch date, and will be heading to PC on 1st March, with a console release to follow. And to celebrate the news, developer Hopoo Games has offered a closer look at the Railgunner - one of two new Survivors joining its enormously successful co-op rogue-like shooter sequel as part of the expansion.
Survivors of the Void brings a significant heft of new content to Risk of Rain 2 - ranging from new bosses and enemies to new items and stages - but the unifying theme (as its name does rather suggest) is The Void. The gateway to this mysterious realm has opened, spilling its innards all over Petrichor V. &quot;For millennia, The Void Creatures have grown dominant by taking artifacts from our realm to theirs,&quot; Hopoo explains. &quot;Now they look to add you to their collection.&quot;

                    <span>Today brings a new trailer for Horizon Forbidden West, showcasing the challenges players will face in its titular West. 
Following on from the events of Horizon Zero Dawn, this sequel puts players back into the shoes of Aloy once more. Unfortunately for the outcast-turned-Nora-hero, however, it does not look as though there will be any time to sit back and relax. A deadly plague now appears to be ravishing the land, threatening life once more.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 just can&#x27;t catch a break.
Earlier this week, DICE announced it would push back the game&#x27;s first season of content updates from the rumoured release month of March to the summer, in order to work on the considerable number of problems plaguing the game and add features such as VOIP chat and an improved scoreboard.

Psychonauts 2, the most recent game from Double Fine, was met with overwhelming praise on its release. Eurogamer&#x27;s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it &quot;witty, eccentric and imaginative&quot; during his review, noting it had a &quot;more developed understanding of mental health&quot; than its predecessor. More recently, the mix of hallucinogenic gameplay and emotional storytelling won Psychonauts 2 the Game of the Year accolade at the New York Game Awards. But even with this success, Double Fine&#x27;s founder Tim Schafer revealed that a movie adaptation of any of his games is not something he is interested in.

Developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) said it is doing this because many of Star Citizen&#x27;s &quot;most passionate players&quot; were taking features added to the roadmap as &quot;promises&quot;, and getting upset when they were delayed.

Capitalising on that success, Nintendo has launched a series of advertising campaigns in an unmistakably Nintendo style that targets a more casual market.

The recent demake from Unreal Engine 4 tech artist and engineer Lilith Walthe saw Bloodborne going back to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 1 roots. Gone were the more realistic graphics of modern games, and in place fans were treated to a wonderful and pixelated nightmare. Eurogamer&#x27;s Ian Higton gave it a whirl, delighting in the demake&#x27;s ability to combine two of his favourite things - Retro games and spanking werewolves.

During Nintendo&#x27;s earning report, company president Shuntaro Furukawa said sales of the Nintendo Switch continue to grow and have already surpassed 100m units sold. While the rate of sales has slowed down over the last 12 months, something that has been attributed to the ongoing chip shortages that have also plagued PlayStation 5 sales, Furukawa is not concerned this is on ongoing trend.

                    <span>Following a smattering of leaks over the past few weeks, Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks&#x27; action-horror title Ghostwire: Tokyo has finally been given an official release date, and will be making its way to PlayStation 5 on 25th March.
Ghostwire: Tokyo got its first (and decidedly enigmatic) showing back at E3 2019; one year on, Tango Gameworks revealed the game to be some sort of action-focussed first-person horror experience unfolding on the rain-slicked streets of Tokyo, where players must energetically thrust their supernatural abilities at strikingly designed spirits known as The Visitors.

It was initially slated for a PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X release some time this year.

While many Marvel fans were likely spending their time hanging out with Groot and co while on board the Milano, others decided to take Star Lord even deeper into the inner workings of the ship. Here, they will have come across a broken fridge door, which in itself is fairly unremarkable. This door can be interacted with, and players can try and close it if they wish, but this would ultimately be to no avail. The fridge door will never remain closed, not matter how often one tries.

As far as Steam&#x27;s flagship events go, first in the queue is another Next Fest, promising to once again heap an impracticably sized avalanche of playable demos upon visitors from 21st-28th February. There&#x27;s a second Next Fest in June, and that&#x27;ll be followed by Steam&#x27;s next big discount event in the form of the Summer Sale, running from 23rd June to 7th July.

Trejo is certainly prolific, having featured in over 250 film and TV roles (including the likes of Machete and From Dusk Till Dawn), and his video game credits are steadily expanding too. His OlliOlli World cameo will be the actor&#x27;s second video game appearance in a little over two months, having been given a starring role in his own Far Cry 6&#x27;s DLC at the end of last year.

                    <span>There are two bills working their way through Congress that would force companies like Apple to allow competitive app stores. Apple hates this, since it would break its monopoly, and it’s making a variety of security arguments to bolster its argument. I have written a rebuttal:
I would like to address some of the unfounded security concerns raised about these bills. It’s simply not true that this legislation puts user privacy and security at risk. In fact, it’s fairer to say that this legislation puts those companies’ extractive business-models at risk. Their claims about risks to privacy and security are both false and disingenuous, and motivated by their own self-interest and not the public interest. App store monopolies cannot protect users from every risk, and they frequently prevent the distribution of important tools that actually enhance security. Furthermore, the alleged risks of third-party app stores and “side-loading” apps pale in comparison to their benefits. These bills will encourage competition, prevent monopolist extortion, and guarantee users a new right to digital self-determination...</span>

                    <span>Nintendo has once again taken aim at YouTube channels streaming soundtracks from its games.
The takedowns started over a year ago now, in December 2020, after which Nintendo fans hit back at the decision to block the soundtracks of games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Mario Kart Wii by trolling the company on social media.

The French publisher will reportedly &quot;take players into the detective Hercule Poirot&#x27;s universe through a revisited classic and a brand new adventure&quot;, suggesting at least one of the new projects is an entirely new story.

In a modest update over the weekend, the PC team at Sony Santa Monica deployed Patch v1.0.4 for the critically acclaimed game, which also includes a fix for unresponsive Atreus so that his state is reset if you restart from your checkpoint. It also addressed an issue where &quot;control functionality would be lost if opening inventory during realm travel sequence&quot;.

                    <span>World War Z developer Saber Interactive has announced a second delay for its Evil Dead game, which will now launch for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on Friday, 13th May this year.
Saber&#x27;s Evil Dead game - a co-operative experience that brings together familiar faces from all across the Evil Dead franchise to battle the forces of Darkness - was initially expected to arrive in 2021. However, the developer made the decision to delay its release last August, pushing the game into February 2022 in order to implement a single-player option for those occasions when co-op companions aren&#x27;t readily to hand.

Maggie was, of course, confirmed as Season 12&#x27;s new hero earlier this week in her very own Stories from the Outlands animated introduction, and Respawn&#x27;s new launch trailer picks up pretty much right where that left off, with Maggie being flown into the Apex Games, as decreed during her trial. From there, it&#x27;s as chaotic as ever, with Maggie showing an unsuspecting solider what for, and, eventually, having a brief reunion with Fuse - who fans might recall was a long-time friend until a disagreement that left Fuse minus one arm.

Wittmann says that everyone she spoke to denied being part of this intelligence agency. But what she describes as a “good indicator,” would be if she could prove that the postal address for this “federal authority” actually leads to the intelligence service’s apparent offices.
“To understand where mail ends up,” she writes (in translation), “[you can do] a lot of manual research. Or you can simply send a small device that regularly transmits its current position (a so-called AirTag) and see where it lands.”...</span>

                    <span>Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut - the tarted up version of Hideo Kojima&#x27;s acclaimed damp hillside traipsing adventure - will be making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on 30th March, with a $10 upgrade offer for owners of the original.
Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut initially launched for PS5 last summer, introducing new story elements, a photo mode, expanded combat, new gadgets - including a laser gun and mounted machine guns - plus a variety of other tweaks to the original. Oh, and and it through in a fully featured racing mode too, because why not? The new PC version, incidentally, also features Xe Super Sampling and ultra-wide monitor support.

                    <span>AI: The Somnium Files - Nirvana Initiative, the sequel to publisher Spike Chunsoft&#x27;s acclaimed 2019 serial killer mystery AI: The Somnium Files, now has a release date, and will be launching for PC, Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on 24th June.
The original AI: The Somnium Files - which was the work of Zero Escape series creator and director Kotaro Uchikoshi - was a noir-ish murder mystery set in a technologically-advanced modern-day Tokyo. Nirvana Initiative, which once again sees Uchikoshi on scenario writing duties, retains the deductive premise of its predecessor but switches things up with a new pairing of protagonists and a new case to solve.

                    <span>A little over 18 months after launch, Ubisoft is calling time on Hyper Scape, its reasonably entertaining entry in the already well-represented free-to-play battle royale genre.
Hyper Scape made its debut in August 2020 after a short PC-only beta, where it was immediately met with a lukewarm reception - Eurogamer called it &quot;as smart as it is generic&quot;. Less than three month later, Ubisoft announced it was embarking on a major overhaul of its 100-player battle royale experience so it could reach its &quot;full potential&quot;.

                    <span>Following a bit of a delay at the end of last year, Steam Deck is almost upon us, with Valve now confirming its highly anticipated portable gaming PC will begin shipping on 28th February.
Given the manufacturing constraints that continue to dog the tech industry amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Valve will be disseminating Steam Deck - as it confirmed when its reservations system opened last July - in waves throughout 2022 and beyond.

                    <span>With February (you may better know it by its more common name, Elden Ring month) less than a week away, it&#x27;s time to do the subscription service additions dance once more. First up is PlayStation Plus, with Sony now confirming Planet Coaster, UFC 4, and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep as February&#x27;s library additions.
It&#x27;s a pleasingly eclectic bunch, that, starting with Frontier Developments&#x27; Planet Coaster, which joins PlayStation Plus for PlayStation 5 only. It&#x27;s a game that seeks to serve up a heap of classic theme park management action, but even speaking as a huge management sim fan that&#x27;s happy to hoover up anything the genre has to offer, Planet Coaster comes up disappointingly short if you&#x27;re looking for a tycoon game with mechanical depth and interesting strategic play. Where it shines, though, is in its immensely powerful creation tools, giving players everything they need to build some truly breathtaking parks and rides.

Joe Danger Touch and its sequel Joe Danger Infinity (which initially came to iOS in 2013 and 2014 respectively) both fell foul of Apple&#x27;s decision to end support for 32-bit apps with iOS11 back in 2017. However, over the last few years, Hello Games has, as detailed in its new announcement, been tinkering on the titles to get them playable again.

Having first hit Steam in 2018, Motorsport Games moved in on KartKraft last year, and the full release will see some 10 laser-scanned tracks, 20 kart manufacturers and plenty by way of mod support. It&#x27;s also one of the better racing experiences you can get in VR, so is worth a punt if you prefer your driving games a bit more immersive.

The first stage is “clicking around in the web console.” We’ve all done this, and it requires no explanation. The second stage is using either CloudFormation or Terraform. These are relatively established mechanisms of configuring your environment. The third stage […]

                    <span>There’s a new ransomware that targets NAT devices made by QNAP:
The attacks started today, January 25th, with QNAP devices suddenly finding their files encrypted and file names appended with a .deadbolt file extension.
Instead of creating ransom notes in each folder on the device, the QNAP device’s login page is hijacked to display a screen stating, “WARNING: Your files have been locked by DeadBolt”….

BleepingComputer is aware of at least fifteen victims of the new DeadBolt ransomware attack, with no specific region being targeted.
As with all ransomware attacks against QNAP devices, the DeadBolt attacks only affect devices accessible to the Internet...</span>

                    <span>Call of Duty&#x27;s next three titles will reportedly still be making their way to PlayStation consoles, despite Microsoft&#x27;s recent acquisition of series publisher Activision Blizzard.
Following last week&#x27;s buyout news, many questions still remain - not least how Activision Blizzard&#x27;s current roster of multi-platform titles will be affected by the purchase, with many predicting that Xbox exclusivity might soon be on the cards for the publisher&#x27;s biggest franchises under Microsoft&#x27;s stewardship.

Johnson is, of course, no stranger to video game movies, having starred in an adaption of id Software&#x27;s first-person shooter Doom back in 2005 (by most accounts not an especially good movie) and more recently appearing in 2018&#x27;s live-action version of arcade favourite Rampage (see previous comment). And now Johnson has confirmed he&#x27;s poised to help bring another poor, unfortunate video game franchise kicking and screaming into cinemas.

                    <span>Last September brought the surprise news that developer Adeline Software&#x27;s much-loved action-adventure series Little Big Adventure was being revived - some 27 years after its debut - and now original co-creator Didier Chanfray has shared a little more of his plans.
The original Little Big Adventure - an evocative blend of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that charted the story of young hero Twinsen, on the run from evil dictator Dr. FunFrock - released back in 1994 and was followed by a sequel three years later. A third instalment, set to conclude the saga, has long been discussed by the series&#x27; creators but has so-far never arrived.

The news comes as Activision Blizzard continues to reel from the shocking allegations it fostered a company culture where sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour were able to thrive, with Blizzard Entertainment itself being called a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; in a State of California lawsuit filed last year.

                    <span>With Apex Legends&#x27; 12th season coming in fast, developer Respawn Entertainment has officially unveiled the battle royale shooter&#x27;s next hero: Fuse&#x27;s one-time pal Mad Maggie.
Maggie first entered the realm of Apex Legends lore a little over a year ago today, as part of Season 8 newcomer Walter &#x27;Fuse&#x27; Fitzroy&#x27;s Stories from the Outlands animated introduction. Here, players saw the demolitions expert spending some quality time with Maggie, his childhood friend, until the pair had a disagreement that left him missing an arm.

Sanderson - whose expansive oeuvre includes the likes of the Mistborn saga and the final chapter in Robert Jordan&#x27;s Wheel of Time series - made the comments during a panel at 2021&#x27;s Dragonsteel MiniCon (as spotted by TechRadar), which has recently surfaced online.

                    <span>Rare will be outlining Sea of Thieves&#x27; &quot;biggest year yet&quot; during a special 2022 preview livestream airing this Thursday, 27th January.
This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve heard that phrase, of course; Sea of Thieves executive producer Joe Neate also teased the multiplayer pirate adventure&#x27;s &quot;biggest year yet&quot; ahead of 2021 - a claim that seems entirely reasonable in hindsight, given that last year saw Sea of Thieves introducing everything from a sizeable map expansion beneath the waves to a wildly cinematic Pirates of the Caribbean crossover. And that&#x27;s not even touching on the likes of new enemies, a new treasure burying mechanic, and more.

                    <span>A California court has permanently banned a Roblox player after he was sued by the game&#x27;s developer for allegedly harassing staff and making terrorist threats to disrupt official events.
The Roblox Corporation initially launched legal action against Roblox YouTuber and content creator Benjamin Robert Simon, known as Ruben Sim, last November, accusing him of leading a &quot;cybermob&quot; against the platform and using &quot;malice, fraud, and oppression&quot; to commit unlawful acts intended to &quot;injure Roblox and its users&quot;.

In a blog post flagged via social media on Friday evening, Ubisoft said that the game&#x27;s 5.6 patch - released four months ago in September 2021 - was actually its final update.

WitcherSeb has been hard at work modding The Witcher 3 to match the Netflix show. Last year the modder released a mod to change Geralt&#x27;s face to that of actor Henry Cavill, as well as mods to add Anya Chalotra&#x27;s likeness to Yennefer and Freya Allan&#x27;s likeness to Ciri.

                    <span>Crowdstrike is reporting that malware targeting Linux has increased considerably in 2021:
Malware targeting Linux systems increased by 35% in 2021 compared to 2020.
XorDDoS, Mirai and Mozi malware families accounted for over 22% of Linux-targeted threats observed by CrowdStrike in 2021.
Ten times more Mozi malware samples were observed in 2021 compared to 2020.

Lots of details in the report.

The Crowdstrike findings aren’t surprising as they confirm an ongoing trend that emerged in previous years.

Making the announcement on Twitter, Ripple Effect Studios&#x27; Justin Weibe - who works as senior design director on the shooter&#x27;s latest instalment - says the plan is to &quot;fix it in the future&quot; and &quot;keep it in alignment with standard game progression&quot;, adding that to do so, the team has also &quot;tightened [its] review process&quot;.

Confirmation came via a customer support representative who responded to a player&#x27;s queries about lost XP, the response for which was then shared on the game&#x27;s subreddit community.

                    <span>Another Apex Legends Wraith glitch has popped up, this time allowing players to draw their weapons and deal damage whilst the fan-favourite character is teleporting.
Ordinarily, Wraith cannot equip weapons in the void, let alone unleash upon suspecting opponents whilst essentially invisible, but players have discovered that they can take pop shots at enemies if they expertly pull off a nifty manoeuvre that uses both Wraith&#x27;s Dimensional Rift ultimate skill and her Into the Void tactical.

                    <span>Raven Software&#x27;s QA team has ended its strike action.
As Matt helpfully summarised for us a couple of days back, the strike began when around a third of the QA team was laid off back in December. The firings - coming after a five-week period of overtime and anticipated end-of-year crunch - occurred despite Activision allegedly promising the team it was working on a pay restructure to increase wages.

As its name suggests, Humankind&#x27;s Endless mod takes its cue from Amplitude&#x27;s long-running series of Endless games, which to date include Dungeon of the Endless, Endless Space and its sequel, and Endless Legends - not to mention a huge number of accompanying expansions.

                    <span>Quality assurance testers at Activision Blizzard&#x27;s Wisconsin-based Raven Software studio - where strike action has been ongoing since December, following the firing of 12 members of the developer&#x27;s QA team - have announced their intention to form a worker&#x27;s union.
The instigating incident - which came amid an already troublesome time for Activision Blizzard management, who had been repeatedly criticised following the California state lawsuit calling the publisher a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - took place in December when around a third of the QA team was laid off. The firings, coming after a five-week period of overtime and anticipated end-of-year crunch, occurred despite Activision allegedly promising the team it was working on a pay restructure to increase wages.

                    <span>China is mandating that athletes download and use a health and travel app when they attend the Winter Olympics next month. Citizen Lab examined the app and found it riddled with security holes.
Key Findings:
MY2022, an app mandated for use by all attendees of the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing, has a simple but devastating flaw where encryption protecting users’ voice audio and file transfers can be trivially sidestepped. Health customs forms which transmit passport details, demographic information, and medical and travel history are also vulnerable. Server responses can also be spoofed, allowing an attacker to display fake instructions to users.

                    <span>PC players with a hankering for some big stompy robot action are in luck; mech shooter Daemon X Machina has been confirmed as next week&#x27;s free Epic Games Store game.
Daemon X Machina, which originally released as a Switch exclusive back in 2019 before making its way to PC the following year, casts players in the role of mercenaries employed by the Orbital organisation. Crucially, these particular mercenaries have access to huge Arsenal mechs, and each successive missions sees players sliding and zooming across vibrantly hued post-apocalyptic arenas blasting the bolts off enormous robot enemies driven by corrupted AIs.

In the aftermath of Microsoft&#x27;s takeover news, many questions remained, not least regarding how the deal would impact platform exclusivity for all of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s currently multi-platform titles, including the likes of Overwatch and Call of Duty.

Valve first discussed its Steam Deck Verified initiative back in October, announcing it had started reviewing the entire Steam catalogue to create a new compatibility ratings system - labelling games as either Verified, Playable, Unsupported, and Unknown - that would provide Steam Deck users with a simple means of checking how games will function on their system.

The Remastered Collection was originally due to launch last September, a mere two weeks after the arrival of the series&#x27; latest entry Life is Strange: True Colors, but publisher Square Enix ultimately made the decision to postpone its release into 2022, citing &quot;the ongoing challenges of the worldwide pandemic&quot;.

                    <span>Last week Orca Security published two critical vulnerabilities in AWS. This led to a bit of a hair-on-fire day, since AWS didn’t get around to saying anything formally about it until later that afternoon. The particularly eye-popping phrase that stood out from one of the announcements was: “Our research team believes, given the data found […]

                    <span>The ABK Workers Alliance - a group of Activision Blizzard employees that has continued to push for major workplace reforms following last year&#x27;s shocking reports detailing a culture of alleged sexual harassment, assault, and inappropriate behaviour at the company - has responded to today&#x27;s news that Microsoft is buying the publisher, saying that while the move is &quot;surprising&quot;, it does not change the group&#x27;s goals.
The ABK Workers Alliance was established last summer, in response to a State of California lawsuit calling Activision Blizzard a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;. Since then, the group has continued its mission to push for change at the publisher, launching a bid for unionisation, setting up a Strike Fund for employees, and calling for the removal (alongside the 1,800 employees that signed a related petition) of controversial CEO Bobby Kotick - who was said to have been aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct and mistreatment of female employees across many parts of the company &quot;for years&quot; in a damning Wall Street Journal report released in November.

It&#x27;s a topic that was touched upon in the briefest of manners in Microsoft&#x27;s original press release announcing the deal, with the company stating, &quot;Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward.&quot;

                    <span>Rolling Stone is reporting that the UK government has hired the M&amp;C Saatchi advertising agency to launch an anti-encryption advertising campaign. Presumably they’ll lean heavily on the “think of the children!” rhetoric we’re seeing in this current wave of the crypto wars. The technical eavesdropping mechanisms have shifted to client-side scanning, which won’t actually help — but since that’s not really the point, it’s not argued on its merits.</span>

                    <span>The developer behind a five-year-old app going by the name Wordle has donated his sudden monetary windfall to charity after confused users began flocking to his ageing puzzler, mistaking it for the smash-hit browser-based word game of the same name. 
Wordle, the new one that is, has taken the world by storm in recent months, with users returning to play the word-based head scratcher day after day. Despite its success, creator Josh Wardle has pledged to keep his game browser-based and ad-free - a decision that&#x27;s lead to plenty of unscrupulous sorts cloning the game to turn a quick profit on mobile app stores.

Here, in a narrative segment set several weeks prior to the events of the main game, Riley reunites with her old friend Ellie, completing a narrative arc begun in comic book prequel The Last of Us: American Dream.

This report illuminates the risks and insecurities for hackers as gig workers, and how bounty programs rely on vulnerable workers to fix their vulnerable systems.

                    <span>Today sees the launch of God of War on PC - arguably the biggest PlayStation franchise to make the leap from console so far - and in a new interview published to coincide with its release, Sony Santa Monica creative director Cory Barlog has revealed it was Sony&#x27;s own internal studios that pushed to get PlayStation games on PC.
Asked if Sony&#x27;s decision to begin porting its games to the platform was something championed by the Santa Monica team early on, Barlog, in conversation with GameInformer, suggested it was actually the developers across Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Studios network that were ultimately instrumental in convincing the company to make the move to PC.

Many would argue it was the original Dying Light&#x27;s extensive programme of post-launch content that proved the greatest contributor to its enormous success - Techland is still supporting the game with a mixture of paid and free content some seven years after its initial release - and the studio looks set to follow the same long-tail formula for its imminent sequel.

The report follows Respawn creative director Mohammad Alavi&#x27;s recent announcement he&#x27;s departing the studio after 11 year to pursue his &quot;next adventure&quot;. Alavi leading development of a &quot;brand new single-player adventure&quot; at the company, first mentioned in a job listing posted last year, and news of his departure prompted some to ponder the fate of the project.

                    <span>So far, Sega&#x27;s had something of a rollercoaster relationship with NFTs, bursting forth fully enthused last summer before seemingly reining that excitement in more recently. However, its corporate machinations continue behind the scenes and new trademark registrations and logos have emerged revealing Sega&#x27;s new gambit to potentially be called Sega NFT.
Sega first shared its interest in joining the NFT and blockchain throng last April, when it revealed it had partnered with Japanese company Double Jump Tokyo to begin selling the likes of visual art, in-game images, and background music based on its new and classic IPs in NFT form. It then repeated its enthusiastic stance as part of an investor briefing in November.

                    <span>New research:
The researchers from the FAS Center for Systems Biology discovered a network of genes important in squid eye development that are known to also play a crucial role in limb development across animals, including vertebrates and insects. The scientists say these genes have been repurposed in squid to make camera-lens-type eyes.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                    <span>I don’t even know what I think about this. Researchers have developed a malware detection system that uses EM waves: “Obfuscation Revealed: Leveraging Electromagnetic Signals for Obfuscated Malware Classification.”
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is constituted of devices that are exponentially growing in number and in complexity. They use numerous customized firmware and hardware, without taking into consideration security issues, which make them a target for cybercriminals, especially malware authors.
We will present a novel approach of using side channel information to identify the kinds of threats that are targeting the device. Using our approach, a malware analyst is able to obtain precise knowledge about malware type and identity, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques which may prevent static or symbolic binary analysis. We recorded 100,000 measurement traces from an IoT device infected by various in-the-wild malware samples and realistic benign activity. Our method does not require any modification on the target device. Thus, it can be deployed independently from the resources available without any overhead. Moreover, our approach has the advantage that it can hardly be detected and evaded by the malware authors. In our experiments, we were able to predict three generic malware types (and one benign class) with an accuracy of 99.82%. Even more, our results show that we are able to classify altered malware samples with unseen obfuscation techniques during the training phase, and to determine what kind of obfuscations were applied to the binary, which makes our approach particularly useful for malware analysts...</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a long and bumpy ride for Dying Light 2, but, a little under four years after its initial announcement, Techland&#x27;s parkour-infused open-world zombie sequel is now just weeks away from release - and to celebrate the occasion, the developer has shown off co-op gameplay and a brief console comparisons video as part of its final Dying Light 2 pre-launch livestream series.
While most of the show was taken up with slightly laboured reminiscences of things past as launch looms (ie. the previous five livestream episodes), Techland did managed to squeeze in one notable bit of new gameplay in the form of a co-op sneak peek.

                    <span>Krafton, the company behind PUBG: Battlegrounds and PUBG: Mobile, has filed a lawsuit against developer Garena, alongside Apple and Google, seeking damages for what it calls &quot;rampant, wilful copyright infringement&quot; by a number of games available on the iOS and Android app stores it considers to be PUBG clones.
Specifically, Krafton (thanks TechCrunch) is targeting the continued availability of Garena&#x27;s Free Fire games - which it calls &quot;thinly veiled unauthorised versions of Battlegrounds&quot; - with the original Free Fire having already been the recipient of a legal challenge by the PUBG developer.

Which is to say that Daytona International Speedway is back.
You might know the circuit from its slightly fanciful appearance in Sega&#x27;s Daytona USA, and while that game remains an all-time great I regret to inform you that the real thing isn&#x27;t overlooked by a cliff with Sonic etched into its face, nor is there a playable slot machine on the bridge over the back straight.

New documents received by Motherboard show that over 100 of those phones were shipped to users in the US, far more than previously believed.
What’s most interesting to me about this new information is how the US used the Australians to get around domestic spying laws:
For legal reasons, the FBI did not monitor outgoing messages from Anom devices determined to be inside the U.S. Instead, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) monitored them on behalf of the FBI, according to previously published court records. ...</span>
