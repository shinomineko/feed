                    <span>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has pushed out a new update to celebrate the ghost investigation game&#x27;s first anniversary.
The Anniversary Update - I see what you did with the name there - is out now and introduces a handful of tweaks and improvements, including a journal &quot;overhaul&quot; that permits you to cross off evidence, change your settings, and generally make it &quot;easier to use and navigate&quot;. 
You can also play offline singleplayer without forcing you to connect to the server, and will no longer get a pity payment of $10 when you fail a contract; now you&#x27;ll &quot;get the insurance depending on the chosen difficulty&quot;. My favourite change might be that failing will also reveal what kind of ghost was terrorising you now, too.

                    <span>Now released from its three-game deal with Sony, Quantic Dream - developer of PlayStation exclusives Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, and Detroit: Become Human - has reportedly signed a deal with Disney and is rumoured to be working on a new Star Wars game.
It&#x27;s a timely rumour, not least because it coincides with LucasFilm moving away from its exclusivity deal with EA, including plans to make a new open-world game based on the fan-favourite franchise with Ubisoft.
&quot;They&#x27;ve now finished their contract with Sony and will be signing with Disney,&quot; French YouTuber Gautoz said in a video this week (thanks, VGC), hypothesising that Quantic&#x27;s recent push back on hostile work environment allegations was to preserve this newly forged partnership. &quot;It looks like they will be working on a Star Wars game.&quot;

                    <span>Revered 90s gaming show, GamesMaster, will be back on our screens later this year after a 23-year break.
While we already knew the show was making its triumphant return on E4 in the UK, a new press release explains that the programme will be back later this year with a &quot;social-first partnership&quot; with Facebook&#x27;s Oculus Quest 2.
Though the show is described as spanning social, digital and linear broadcast, all episodes will initially premiere on E4&#x27;s YouTube channel and will be followed by a linear play on E4.

                    <span>Good news for fans of party games - the eighth instalment of The Jackbox Party Pack is set to release on October 14, 2021.
If you missed the announcement teaser a couple of weeks back, here it is:
The Jackbox Party Pack 8 will feature five new games - Job Job, Weapons Drawn, Drawful Animate, the Wheel of Enormous Proportions, and Poll Mine. Here&#x27;s how the developer describes each of the new games courtesy of a recent blog post (thanks, TheGamer):

                    <span>No, it&#x27;s not just you - Apex Legends&#x27; servers are unstable right now.
The problem first crept in a few days back, but despite fixes and assurances from Respawn that the issues had been rectified, the developer has since acknowledged that despite improvements, players are continuing to experience &quot;roughly three times the normal rate of disconnect errors&quot;.
&quot;We&#x27;re ramping up our server capacity today and have some scheduled fixes for tomorrow. However, we believe some problems will require work through the weekend,&quot; the team announced on Friday.

The heavily advertised anti-cheat measures have yet to be introduced, of course - which means the cheat systems players use in Warzone and Modern Warfare 2019 are very likely still functional - but nonetheless, the prevalence of in-game cheating is once again dominating the game&#x27;s reddit and social media pages.
Right now the beta is only available for those who&#x27;ve pre-ordered the shooter but already players are reporting - and even providing video evidence - of what seem to be wall hacks and other cheats (thanks, VGC).

                    <span>Riot Games has outlined changes it hopes will improve player behaviour when it comes to idling or leaving early in League of Legends. 
&quot;We know that AFKs and leavers are some of the most disruptive behaviours you face, so we&#x27;re happy to be coming to you today with an update around AFK and Leaver punishments.&quot; wrote BarackProbama and TimTamMonster in s blog on the game&#x27;s official website.
Bundling both idle &quot;AFK&quot; behaviour and intentional quitters together as one single nuisance, the pair said that the team was introducing a number of new &quot;prongs&quot; to manage the issue, including new penalty &quot;tiers&quot; and a means of &quot;shielding&quot; players from repeat offenders.

Not your preferred music streaming platform? Don&#x27;t panic. According to Sonic&#x27;s own social media manager, the album will be &quot;rolling out to other services soon&quot;, &quot;hopefully by next week&quot; (thanks, NME).
Even if you&#x27;re not a music streaming subscriber, however, you can sample the wonder of Sonic&#x27;s music by the Tomoya Ohtani Band, Crush 40, and Sonic Adventure Music Experience by previewing the tracks right now on iTunes. No, you won&#x27;t get the full-length glory of the FILMharmonic Orchestra Prague renditions, but even the brief snippets of the preview tracks are a wonderful treat.

                    <span>Remember that surprise new mobile RPG that Sega teased yesterday? Well, people are already downvoting the reveal trailer on YouTube. 
Though we still don&#x27;t know very much about it at all - right now all we have is a very brief teaser and a website with very little information on it - fans are registering their dismay that it&#x27;s a mobile-only title in the only way they know how; by downvoting it.
Without knowing anything else about the new IP, the teaser trailer is currently racking up four times as many likes as dislikes on its Japanese-language YouTube account. While I can&#x27;t attest to the flavour of the comments left in Japanese, the majority of English-language comments seem unhappy that the game is seemingly only coming to mobile devices which leave some fearing it will be &quot;monetise[d] to death&quot;.

                    <span>Just like its predecessor, Dying Light 2 will feature weapon degradation.
Confirmation about the beleaguered zombie game&#x27;s combat came in the latest instalment of the game&#x27;s Dying 2 Know More series in which PR specialist Paulina Dziedziak spoke to producer Szymon Strauss.
However, things will be slightly different this time around. The team insists that because &quot;the world has changed&quot;, the weapons we used in the original game &quot;wore out&quot;. Although you&#x27;ll occasionally come across a &quot;high-tier&quot; ready-made weapon, they&#x27;re rare to find and pretty expensive, so we&#x27;ll mostly be &quot;building stuff from scraps and materials you find on the fly&quot;.

It&#x27;s the first game the company has released since allegations of a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture at Activision Blizzard were made by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, although it&#x27;s important to note that the lead developer here is Vicarious Visions, which has not been involved nor implicated in the legal complaint.
&quot;It was definitely very troubling to hear these types of things,&quot; design director Rob Gallerani told Axios (thanks, VGC). &quot;And we really wanted to support our colleagues and our co-workers.&quot;

                    <span>Following some sneaky teasing earlier this year, and a spot of more recent leakage from Sony, THQ Nordic has officially confirmed that Destroy All Humans 2 is getting the remake treatment.
Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed, as THQ is calling its latest remake, will be &quot;developed from scratch&quot; in Unreal Engine 4 by Black Forest Games, the studio behind the striking 2020 remake of the original Destroy All Humans.
The sequel, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, initially released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox back in 2006, serving up a second helping of comedic ET action charting the continuing adventures of Crypto as he rampages across the 1960s following the destruction of his mothership by the KGB - a chaotic journey that sees him soaking up (and blowing up) the sights in the US, UK, Soviet Union, Japan, and even to the moon. Expect all that in the remake, only prettier.

                    <span>A sequel to cult-classic sci-fi adventure Outcast is in the works, with original developer Appeal Studios once again at the helm.
Outcast 2: A New Beginning, as the sequel is known, unfolds 20 years after the original adventure (which released back in 1999) as preposterously named series protagonist, and ex-Navy Seal, Cutter Slade returns for another jaunt across the alien world of Adelpha. 
This time, the planet is under threat of invasion, as a ruthless army of robots begins enslaving and murdering its citizens. Cutter&#x27;s mission - unfolding as a 3rd-person open-world action-adventure that should be familiar to fans of the original - is to mount a resistance, liberate the people, and rid Adelpha of the robot invaders once and for all.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s schedule of Capcom-themed crossovers continues next Friday, 24th September, with the arrival of long-serving Mega Man character, Rush.
Capcom&#x27;s Mega Man crossover - the fourth post-launch collaboration update to release for Monster Hunter Rise since its launch back in March - follows cameos for the likes of Okami&#x27;s Amaterasu and Street Fighter 5&#x27;s Akuma.
This time, though, players will be able to unlock a brand-new piece of layered armour turning their trusty Palamute companion into the Mega Man series&#x27; robo-canine Rush, even replacing the standard Palamute dash animation with the Rush Jet ability.

                    <span>Yuji Naka, famed creator of Sonic the Hedgehog, has revealed he&#x27;s teaching himself how to program his own smartphone game following his departure from Square Enix earlier this year.
Naka joined Square Enix in 2018, and his first project with the publisher - action-platformer Balan Wonderworld - was announced last summer for release this year. Unfortunately, Balan Wonderland was met with generally unfavourable reviews and disappointing sales when it launched in April, and Naka confirmed his departure from Square Enix in June. At the time, he told Twitter, &quot;I&#x27;m 55 years old, so I may retire.&quot;
It seems Naka has been busy since then, however, and he&#x27;s celebrated his birthday today by revealing some of what he&#x27;s been up to since leaving Square. &quot;Thank you for your birthday message,&quot; he wrote on Twitter. &quot;Recently I&#x27;ve started studying programs again, and I&#x27;m making a simple game for smartphones with Unity.&quot;

                    <span>Splitgate will get its own version of forge mode before it arrives in Halo Infinite, developer 1047 Games has said.
In a response to a tweet by KFCGaming of all places, the official Splitgate account announced the plans. 
Forge mode, which made its debut in Bungie&#x27;s Halo 3, lets players edit and create playable maps that can then be shared with the community.

                    <span>Dota 2 will soon remove support for 32-bit systems, Valve has warned.
The mega-popular MOBA launched eight years ago, and Valve said it&#x27;s time to leave older tech behind.
So, in the coming months, Dota 2 players will need to have a 64-bit machine and operating system to run the game.

                    <span>When we finally got a first look at God Of War Ragnarok during the PlayStation Showcase last week, Sony also confirmed the game is the last of the Norse mythology series. This took everyone by surprise, since the Greek mythology series had three mainline games. 
Now, in an interview with God of War YouTuber Kaptain Kuba, Santa Monica Studio&#x27;s creative director Cory Barlog explained the decision.
&quot;There are several reasons, I think one of the most important reasons is [time],&quot; Barlog said. &quot;The first game took five years. The second game, I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to take but I&#x27;m just going to throw out that it&#x27;s going to take close to a similar time, right, to do this.

                    <span>Sir Clive Sinclair, perhaps best known as the inventor of the enormously popular ZX Spectrum home computer, has died at the age of 81 following a long illness.
Although Sinclair found success creating a range of small calculators in the early 70s, it was the advent of his first, highly affordable mass-market computer in 1980, the ZX80 - which retailed for less than £100 - that helped make him a household name.
In 1982, the ZX80 and its successor the ZX81 were followed by one of Sinclair&#x27;s most influential products, the ZX Spectrum - a colour-capable home computer that, thanks to its popularity, played a key role in kickstarting the British software industry, leading to the creation of some of the era&#x27;s most iconic games, from Manic Miner, Chuckie Egg, and Jet Pac to Lords of Midnight, Knight Lore, and Horace Goes Skiing.

                    <span>Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, the latest entry in developer Frogwares&#x27; well-regarded deduction-based adventure series, now has a release date and will be coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, an PC on 16th November, with a PS4 and Xbox One release to follow.
Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, as its name suggests, serves as a prequel to Frogwares&#x27; previous Sherlock Holmes titles, taking players back to the detective&#x27;s days as a fresh-faced 21-year-old and the events that would lead to his life of sleuthing. It begins as Sherlock, with best friend Jon in tow, arrives on the sunny, Mediterranean-inspired island of Cordona - a significant aesthetic departure to the fog-shrouded London streets and rural corners of Frogwares&#x27; previous adventure - on the tenth anniversary of his mother&#x27;s death.
Frogwares has already shared some of the new and returning mechanics players can expect in this latest third-person, open-world investigation adventure, but the developer has now offered some additional information in a new 7-minute gameplay &quot;deep dive&quot; trailer.

                    <span>Following its majestic, Pirates of the Caribbean infused third season, Sea of Thieves will be embarking on a new adventure next Thursday, 23rd September, with the arrival of Season 4.
As to what&#x27;s in store this time around (beyond the inevitable fresh 100 levels of seasonal progression and rewards), Rare remains in a teasing mood, albeit dropping some major hints in Season 4&#x27;s newly revealed announcement trailer.
It appears the malevolant sirens - which got a long-awaited and wonderfully orchestrated introduction during Season 3&#x27;s A Pirate&#x27;s Life campaign - are poised to play an even bigger role. Last season&#x27;s spectacular Sunken Pearl Tall Tale took pirates down into the depths to visit the gorgeous coral-hewn home of the Siren Queen, and it seems we&#x27;ll be visiting more areas of the sirens&#x27; long-lost kingdom once Season 4 gets underway.

                    <span>FIFA 22 Ultimate Team features the mode&#x27;s long-standing and controversial loot boxes, EA has confirmed.
However, EA will use the preview packs it trialed towards the end of FIFA 21&#x27;s life.
In June, under increasing pressure from governments, children&#x27;s welfare groups and gambling charities, EA added the ability to see what&#x27;s inside FIFA 21 loot boxes before you buy them.

Details are scarce, as the rest of the listing is being deliberately obscured until Nintendo officially announces the product, or for up to 180 days (which would take us to March next year).

Arsen Shakhbabyan, an animator who helped make the controversial Aeon Must Die trailer that first premiered during last year&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play broadcast, had his attorney file the copyright claim after the trailer re-emerged on publisher Focus Home Interactive&#x27;s YouTube channel last month.
The trailer for the game shown during the August 2020 State of Play, below, depicts a visually arresting beat-&#x27;em-up that caught the attention of PlayStation fans.

Yes, this is an official WipEout game - at least in name, anyway. The debut trailer, below, clearly shows PlayStation&#x27;s trademark at the end. It will feature &quot;unique card-based racing&quot; and a single-player campaign.
WipEout Rush is developed by Rogue Games, a studio set up by former IGN journalist and co-founder Matt Casamassina. IGN has the exclusive on the game&#x27;s reveal today:

                    <span>343 plans to ditch Halo: The Master Chief Collection&#x27;s seasons after Halo Infinite comes out, it&#x27;s signalled.
Season 8, which launches later this autumn, may prove to be MCC&#x27;s last season, as 343 moves away from the game&#x27;s season model to focus on smaller updates &quot;that can land when they&#x27;re ready based on development status and studio roadmap alignment&quot;.
343 insisted these updates will continue to be free and will include the unreleased features and content from this year, and it will make a continued effort to improve stability and tackle legacy fixes where possible. &quot;We still have a lot of goodness to deliver in 2022,&quot; 343&#x27;s publishing team lead producer Michael &quot;Farns&quot; Fahrny said in a post on Halo Waypoint.

                    <span>Following some uncertainty after Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s release date reveal last week and a subsequent blog post that stated one of the new campaign modes will require an online connection, Polyphony Digital has confirmed that an internet connection is necessary to play the game&#x27;s main campaign. 
The addition of a fully fleshed out campaign is one of the key new features in Gran Turismo 7, following its absence at the heart of the online-focussed Gran Turismo Sport. Gran Turismo 7&#x27;s campaign leans heavily on the series&#x27; past, allowing full modding and customisation of cars, as well as placing a fresh emphasis on the car collecting side with new and used dealerships and an all-new GT Cafe that lends some structure to the hoarding of cars. 
A blog post published in the immediate aftermath of the release date reveal stated that an online connection is required for GT Cafe, something series creator Kazunori Yamauchi was able to expand upon in a recent interview with Eurogamer.

                    <span>It’s the eyes:
The researchers note that in many cases, users can simply zoom in on the eyes of a person they suspect may not be real to spot the pupil irregularities. They also note that it would not be difficult to write software to spot such errors and for social media sites to use it to remove such content. Unfortunately, they also note that now that such irregularities have been identified, the people creating the fake pictures can simply add a feature to ensure the roundness of pupils.

And the arms race continues….

Last month&#x27;s release of Kubernetes v1.22 introduced a new ReadWriteOncePod access mode for PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.
With this alpha feature, Kubernetes allows you to restrict volume access to a single pod in the cluster.
What are access modes and why are they important?
When using storage, there are different ways to model how that storage is consumed.
For example, a storage system like a network file share can have many users all reading and writing data simultaneously.
In other cases maybe everyone is allowed to read data but not write it.
For highly sensitive data, maybe only one user is allowed to read and write data but nobody else.
In the world of Kubernetes, access modes are the way you can define how durable storage is consumed.

                    <span>After being compelled by a Swiss court to monitor IP logs for a particular user, ProtonMail no longer claims that “we do not keep any IP logs.”
EDITED TO ADD (9/14): This seems to be more complicated. ProtonMail is not yet saying that they keep logs. Their privacy policy still states that they do not keep logs except in certain circumstances, and outlines those circumstances. And ProtonMail’s warrant canary has an interesting list of data orders they have received from various authorities, whether they complied, and why or why not.

In distributed systems, it can be hard to figure out where problems are. You grep through one component&#x27;s logs just to discover that the source of your problem is in another component.  You search there only to discover that you need to enable debug logs to figure out what really went wrong... And it goes on. The more complex the path your request takes, the harder it is to answer questions about where it went.  I&#x27;ve personally spent many hours doing this dance with a variety of Kubernetes components. Distributed tracing is a tool which is designed to help in these situations, and the Kubernetes API Server is, perhaps, the most important Kubernetes component to be able to debug.

Ben Swartzlander (NetApp)
Kubernetes v1.22, released earlier this month, introduced a redesigned approach for volume
populators. Originally implemented
in v1.18, the API suffered from backwards compatibility issues. Kubernetes v1.22 includes a new API
field called dataSourceRef that fixes these problems.
Data sources
Earlier Kubernetes releases already added a dataSource field into the
PersistentVolumeClaim API,
used for cloning volumes and creating volumes from snapshots. You could use the dataSource field when
creating a new PVC, referencing either an existing PVC or a VolumeSnapshot in the same namespace.
That also modified the normal provisioning process so that instead of yielding an empty volume, the
new PVC contained the same data as either the cloned PVC or the cloned Volu…</span>

This blog describes the notion of Availability for StatefulSet workloads, and a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.22 which adds minReadySeconds configuration for StatefulSets.
What problems does this solve?
Prior to Kubernetes 1.22 release, once a StatefulSet Pod is in the Ready state it is considered Available to receive traffic. For some of the StatefulSet workloads, it may not be the case. For example, a workload like Prometheus with multiple instances of Alertmanager, it should be considered Available only when Alertmanager&#x27;s state transfer is complete, not when the Pod is in Ready state. Since minReadySeconds adds buffer, the state transfer may be complete before the Pod becomes Available. While this is not a fool proof way of…</span>

This blog post is about a new Kubernetes feature introduced in v1.22, which adds
an additional security layer on top of the existing seccomp support. Seccomp is
a security mechanism for Linux processes to filter system calls (syscalls) based
on a set of defined rules. Applying seccomp profiles to containerized workloads
is one of the key tasks when it comes to enhancing the security of the
application deployment. Developers, site reliability engineers and
infrastructure administrators have to work hand in hand to create, distribute
and maintain the profiles over the applications life-cycle.
You can use the securityContext field of Pods and their
containers can be used to adjust security related configurations of the
workload. Kubernetes introduced dedicated …</span>
