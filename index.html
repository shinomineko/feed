                              <span>An American judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against Nintendo for its Joy-Con drift issues, saying the case cannot proceed because the owners agreed to Nintendo&#x27;s End User License Agreement (EULA) that &quot;disallows lawsuits&quot;.

Despite attempts to argue that underaged children - who used the handheld system - cannot enter into the agreement, the federal judge ultimately ruled that the agreement was with the &quot;de facto owners&quot;, the parents, and not the children who actually used the console. 

Consequently, the judge dismissed the action, stating that the parents should have entered legal arbitration rather than a lawsuit, as instructed by the EULA (thanks, NE).

                              <span>&quot;It&#x27;s quite a stunning world that [the developers] created, so it gave me an opportunity to write some very beautiful music,&quot; says Forspoken co-composer Garry Schyman. &quot;It really was an opportunity to write something that&#x27;s not just combat and not just dark; it was an opportunity to write melodies.&quot;


Forspoken is the latest fantasy epic from Square Enix, following a young woman named Frey who finds herself transported from modern day New York to the strange world of Athia. Composers Garry Schyman (the BioShock series, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and more) and Bear McCreary (God of War Ragnarök, and Amazon&#x27;s Rings of Power series) took on the job together of writing music for Frey&#x27;s adventure.


But how do you create the sound of a fantasy world through music? And what is the musical voice of Frey?

                              <span>Dying Light 2 will shortly turn one year old, and to mark the upcoming anniversary, developer Techland has confirmed the zombie game franchise has collectively shifted more than 30 million units.

As part of the first anniversary celebrations, Techland also revealed that it has a &quot;plethora of celebrations and updates for the community&quot;, including a 50 per cent off sale and hints that the franchise has plans to branch out to &quot;other medias&quot;.

There&#x27;ll be a week-long celebration wherein players can win goodies by completing community goals in the Bloody Anniversary event and Dropkick Weekend, where premium bundles can be won. And if you watch or participate in Dying Light 2 livestreams between now and 7th February, there&#x27;ll be more &quot;nostalgic swag via Twitch Drops&quot;, too.

                              <span>Capcom has released 12 whole minutes of new Resident Evil 4 Remake footage. 

Capcom partnered with Game Informer to share the new teaser, sharing &quot;an extended gameplay walkthrough of the game’s fifth chapter&quot;, set right after Leon meets Ashley. You can check it out below (thanks, Resetera):

As well as showing off the church and cemetery sequences - and lots of meaty combat, of course, including a battle with Luis Serra - the video also reveals a sneaky QTE (you&#x27;ll find it at 6.38 mins in) which is interesting given Resident Evil 4 Remake reportedly has &quot;barely any&quot; QTEs at all.

                              <span>Evil Dead: The Game&#x27;s new - and free - Splatter Royale mode is now live.

The 40-player battle royale mode introduces two new weapons - the long-range Grenade Launcher and the Scythe - as well as new premium character Ruby Knowby, voiced by Lucy Lawless. There&#x27;s also a new free Kandarian Facelift outfit for Pablo, too.

Alongside the free battle royale mode, players can also get hold of the Immortal Power DLC Bundle, which includes Ruby Knowby, who - as a dark one - can regenerate health, increase her possession resistance, and boost the damage of her weapons. She can also &quot;consume souls to make her aura stronger and charger her unique ability, triggering a deadly blast that damages evil units within range and heals nearby Survivors&quot;.

Bandai Namco invited fans to &quot;save the date&quot; of an anniversary event set to take place on 25th February in Stockholm, Sweden. Fans who can&#x27;t be there in person can join in via a livestream on Twitch.

The &quot;live show&quot; will host &quot;giveaways, contests, exclusive prizes, pub quiz, drinks, cosplay, and PvP&quot;. And whilst there&#x27;s no formal word about the eagerly-anticipated DLC, I doubt it&#x27;ll surprise you to hear that fans are desperately hoping that this may be when From Software finally drops more information. Watch this space, I guess.

Schafer - best known for games like Grim Fandango, Psychonauts, and Broken Age - will be honoured at the 26th annual DICE event later this month (not to be confused with EA&#x27;s Stockholm studio of the same name).

&quot;Tim&#x27;s creative impact on the industry cannot be understated,&quot; said Meggan Scavio, president of the AIAS. &quot;For over 30 years, he has heralded imaginative games that have inspired countless others with his humour and originality.

I have done a written interview and a  podcast interview about the book. It’s been chosen as a “February 2023 Must-Read Book” by the Next Big Idea Club. And an “Editor’s Pick”—whatever that means—on Amazon.
There have been three reviews so far. I am hoping for more. And maybe even a published excerpt or two.
Amazon and others will start shipping the book on Tuesday. If you ordered a signed copy from me, it is already in the mail.
If you can leave a review somewhere, I would appreciate it.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Facial Misrecognition Systems: Simple Weight Manipulations Force DNNs to Err Only on Specific Persons“:
Abstract: In this paper we describe how to plant novel types of backdoors in any facial recognition model based on the popular architecture of deep Siamese neural networks, by mathematically changing a small fraction of its weights (i.e., without using any additional training or optimization). These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other’s existence with almost no interference...</span>

                              <span>Activision Blizzard will pay $35m USD to settle charges raised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following a probe relating to workplace misconduct.


The SEC launched its investigation into Activision Blizzard in September 2021, subpoenaing CEO Bobby Kotick and other senior executives to provide their internal communications regarding the company&#x27;s response to the high-profile allegations of widespread misconduct and harassment within the company.


After concluding its investigation, the SEC charged that the publisher had failed to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that would ensure it could adequately collect and analyse employees&#x27; complaints of workplace misconduct. As a result, it said, Activision Blizzard&#x27;s management lacked sufficient information to &quot;understand the volume and substance of employee complaints about workplace misconduct&quot;, leaving it without the means to determine whether larger issues existed that needed to be disclosed to investors.

                              <span>Developer Smilegate has announced the impending closure of its year-old Xbox multiplayer shooter CrossfireX, which will shut down on 18th May - a move that&#x27;ll also affect its Remedy developed single-player campaign.


CrossfireX - the console version of Smilegate&#x27;s hugely popular PC shooter Crossfire - launched for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S last February, combining the multiplayer component of the PC original with a specially developed single-player campaign.


A little over a year on from that troubled launch, Smilegate has announced it&#x27;ll soon be ending support for the game. &quot;It is with the deepest regret that we are informing you of our decision to end support for CrossfireX on May 18, 2023,&quot; it wrote in a statement on its website. &quot;Since the launch of the game, we have worked tirelessly to bring it to a point where we can all be proud, and throughout it all we have had the honour and pleasure of supporting our players.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Innersloth has shared its development plans for the next 12 months of social deduction hit Among Us, confirming the year ahead will bring the likes of improved matchmaking and a brand-new map.


Innersloth&#x27;s roadmap is a little light in terms of ETAs, but it&#x27;s first order of business - user interface and user experience updates for Among Us - are said to be &quot;coming soon&quot;.


&quot;We want to make playing Among Us an easier, more intuitive experience,&quot; the developer explained in a post accompanying its new roadmap. &quot;This means big focus on adding multiple updates to the UI and UX...of the game. Cleaning up the account merging flow, updating the store to be easier to navigate, making it easier to see how you can report a toxic player... these are all things we want to work on, and more.&quot;

                              <span>The Last of Us: Part 1 will arrive on PC a little later than expected, with Naughty Dog announcing a new 28th March release date to ensure the game arrives &quot;in the best possible shape&quot;.


The Last of Us Part 1 - Naughty Dog&#x27;s new-gen spruce-up of the acclaimed 2013 stealth survival horror - initially launched for PlayStation 5 last September, and the long-promised PC version was eventually confirmed to be arriving on 3rd March this year.


With a month to go until its originally planned launch date, however, Naughty Dog has confirmed a 25-day delay. &quot;Let&#x27;s get right to it,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;We initially announced The Last of Us Part 1 PC release would be 3rd March, but we&#x27;ve decided to push its launch date out by just a few week; it will now be released on 28th March.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has responded to the European Union&#x27;s now-formalised antitrust warning, slapped down to contest its attempt at an Activision Blizzard acquistion. 


The EU&#x27;s intent to object to Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $68.7bn deal was first reported last month. Now it has been finalised - and Microsoft has said it was &quot;confident&quot; it could address the issues raised.


As expected, the EU has intervened over a percieved risk in Microsoft owning Call of Duty, something it fears could reduce competition in the video games industry, Politico reported today.

                              <span>Legendary game designer Jeff Minter&#x27;s psychedelic reimagining of Atari&#x27;s &#x27;80s arcade prototype Akka Arrh comes to PC and consoles on 21st February.


The original Akka Arrh was created by Atari&#x27;s Mike Hally and Dave Ralston in 1982, but the unfinished prototype never went into full production and only three cabinets are still said to exist. More recently, however, the prototype did get an airing in last year&#x27;s superb Atari 50: Anniversary Celebration collection.


Minter&#x27;s reimagining of Akka Arrh will take the core of the original and build it out into &quot;a cascade of words, colour, shapes and sound [flowing] around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers&quot;.

                              <span>Square Enix has detailed its financial results for the current financial year up to 31st December 2022, and recorded an annual fall in sales and income.


The Final Fantasy publisher recorded net sales of 255bn yen (£1.6bn), down nearly seven percent on the same nine-month time period year-on-year. Operating income was 41bn yen (£258m), down nearly 18 percent  on the same time period year-on-year.


Over the nine months ending 31st December 2022, Square Enix launched a large number of games but lacked a major Final Fantasy release. Instead, between April and December 2022, Square Enix released Nintendo Switch exclusive Live a Live, fantasy farming sim Harvestella, The Diofield Chronicle, Valkyrie Elysium, Tactics Ogre: Reborn, and Star Ocean: The Divine Force, among others.

                              <span>Xbox studio The Coalition has reportedly cancelled two unannounced games in order to focus solely on its next project: Gears 6.


That&#x27;s according to Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb, speaking on his Game Mess Mornings show, who claims this is a knock on from recent layoffs at Microsoft.


He said the developer had been working on two smaller projects, as well as support work on Halo Infinite and assisting Epic with its The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 tech demo.

                              <span>A sequel to the Pokémon: Detective Pikachu movie could still happen, according to the film&#x27;s production company - despite years of silence on a possible follow-up.


A Detective Pikachu sequel was first discussed months ahead of the original movie&#x27;s release, with Legendary Entertainment keen to capitalise on pre-launch hype. Sadly, we&#x27;ve not heard much more on a possible Pikachu return ever since, despite the movie&#x27;s popularity upon release.


Now, Legendary Entertainment has claimed its sequel is still &quot;in active development&quot; when questioned on its status by Polygon. What this exactly means is unclear.

It means the game&#x27;s ninth season - launching on 28th February - will be its last, before servers are shut down on 6th June.


&quot;This was an extremely difficult decision for us, but a necessary and important one for our studio,&quot; reads a farewell blog post from Jeremy Russo, game director at developer Velan Studios.

                              <span>Hello and welcome to the Eurogamer Newscast, which this week is all about the best (and worst) video game adaptations. We&#x27;ve all been watching The Last of Us which has become a properly massive TV event - but it&#x27;s not the first great video game adaptation by any means.

Is it the best? It&#x27;s certainly up there - though there&#x27;s strong competition already from things like Netflix&#x27;s Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and The Witcher series, and the wonderful League of Legends animation Arcane. Beyond those? We have some personal favourites - you&#x27;ll have to listen to find out which. 
Joining me to pick out our highlights and lowlights are Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy, and yes, the Chris Barrie-starring Angelina Joie Tomb Raider film does indeed get a mention.

Observability requires the right data at the right time for the right consumer (human or piece of software) to make the right decision. In the context of Kubernetes, having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial.
SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the Api server, scheduler, kubelet and kube-controller-manager.
In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed, SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with Elana Hashman, and Han Kang, chairs of SIG Instrumentation, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute.

                              <span>Following Bloomberg&#x27;s recent claims EA had cancelled an unannounced single-player game set in the Titanfall/Apex Legends universe, reliable leaker Jeff Grubb has shared additional details, saying the project was a &quot;Titanfall-feeling&quot; single-player campaign that would have been included in Apex Legends rather than being a standalone title.


Grubb, who&#x27;s been in a particularly leaky mood this evening, made the claims during a Giant Bomb podcast (as transcribed by VGC), saying he&#x27;d heard from sources that the cancelled project was part of a broader push to expand the scope of Apex Legends.


&quot;In two weeks from now, Apex Legends is going to get Team Deathmatch, and that was always part of a plan to turn Apex Legends into this platform where you could get all kinds of different shooter experiences from an expanded Apex Legends/Titanfall world&quot;, Grubb explained.

                              <span>EA has revealed The Sims 4&#x27;s previously teased new Infants life stage will arrive as a free update to the base game on 16th March, and it&#x27;ll launch alongside the newly revealed Growing Together Expansion Pack, which aims to expand gameplay options across all life stages.


The Sims 4&#x27;s new Infants life stage is intended to bridge the existing gap between newborns and toddlers, fleshing out Sims&#x27; earliest years by introducing adorable little toerags with their own personalities, needs, emotions, and sentiments.


The free update will give players the tools to create and modify infants in Create-a-Sim, and includes a broad range of clothing, accessories, and hairstyles. It&#x27;ll also feature various Infant-themed interactions, including the ability to adopt Infants, change their nappies, given them a nap, put them down to sleep, and more.

                              <span>Developer Fntastic has shared a 10-minute gameplay trailer for its now twice-delayed open-world zombie survival MMO The Day Before.


Fntastic announced The Day Before back in 2021, and its striking reveal trailer helped propel it to the top of Steam&#x27;s most wishlisted games chart. Since then, though, it&#x27;s received two last-minute delays in rather bizarre circumstances - first, Fntastic suddenly announced it was switching development to Unreal Engine 5 a month before its initial June 2022 release date, setting launch back by a year, then at the end of January, with just two months to go before its revised launch date, the developer pulled the game&#x27;s Steam listing and announced another nine-month delay, this time blaming a trademark dispute.


The extremely limited amount of footage seen of The Day Before as all that played out only helped to fuel internet speculation the game was some sort of scam - suggestions Fantastic recently rebuffed, arguing, &quot;We didn&#x27;t take a penny from people: no crowdfunding, no pre-orders, no donations. The game is fully funded by Mytona, one of the largest mobile publishers in the world, who checked the game&#x27;s build at every milestone per our contract.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Turtle Rock has confirmed it won&#x27;t be releasing any more new content for its co-op zombie shooter Back 4 Blood as the studio shifts its focus to its next project.


Back 4 Blood - which combines Left4Dead-style zombie slaughter with a sprinkling of deck-building to bring variety to playthroughs - launched back in October 2021 and has received a total of three paid expansions since then.


The most recent of these, River of Blood, launched in December, and is now confirmed to be the last new content releasing for the game. Turtle Rock shared the news on its website, explaining work on its next title is now underway and that the studio &quot;doesn&#x27;t have enough folks to continue working on Back 4 Blood&quot; at the same time.

Word on Insomniac&#x27;s PS5-exclusive Wolverine title - which was described as being &quot;very early in development&quot; when it was teased back in September 2021 - comes via the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb, speaking during a recent Giant Bomb livestream (thanks VGC).


According to Grubb, two potential Wolverine launch windows have been surfaced by his sources; the game could possibly arrive as early as a year after Insomniac&#x27;s highly anticipated Spider-Man 2, which is currently expected to launch this autumn, but the studio is also said to be &quot;still very much talking about 2025&quot; internally. &quot;But if anyone can pull off releasing two major, triple-A, massive games in back-to-back years,&quot; Grubb added, &quot;it is Insomniac.&quot;

CrossfireX joined Xbox Game Pass exactly a year ago. 12 months on, its time is now up, alongside fellow February 2022 additions Besiege, Infernax, Skul: The Hero Slayer and The Last Kids on Earth. 

Remedy&#x27;s work on Crossfire X marked a departure for the studio best known for its spooky atmospheric shooters, as it formed part of the larger Crossfire title developed by Korean studio Smilegate. Martin dubbed it &quot;smart dumb FPS action&quot;.

MedBays are all fairly simply designed, with beds and other items you might expect to see. Nothing out of the ordinary, unless you count the little beans running around here and there, trying not to get got. 
However, it turns out these simple room designs were unintentionally controversial, thanks to the inclusion of a red cross on the wall of The Skeld&#x27;s MedBay.

                              <span>NASCAR, the governing body for America&#x27;s blockbuster stock car racing series, has announced a tweaked rulebook for the coming season - and amidst the changes there&#x27;s clarification that Ross Chastain&#x27;s GameCube-inspired wall-ride from last year&#x27;s race at Martinsville will no longer be allowed. 


Chastain made the bold move on the last corner the Xfinity 500 that takes place at Martinsville - one of the smaller ovals on the NASCAR circuit, demanding a tight line from competitors - slamming his car into the wall to drive around the outside of five cars to leap from 10th to 5th position. 


&quot;I played a lot of NASCAR 2005 on the GameCube which I had growing up,&quot; Chastain said after the race. &quot;You could get away with it, and I never knew if it would actually work [in real life].&quot;

                              <span>Elden Ring received a surge in sales at the end of 2022, which has been attributed to its success at The Game Awards.


FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa published its third quarter earnings earlier today, with &quot;worldwide blockbuster&quot; Elden Ring driving a 206.4 percent increase in net sales across the gaming division.


&quot;In part as a result of the title winning Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2022, an overseas game award event held in December, the number of units sold increased again. This reaffirms the long-lasting popularity of the game,&quot; reads the report.

                              <span>Silent Hill publisher Konami has today slashed its financial forecast for the 12-month period ending this March 31st, with expected profits almost halved. 


Konami had hoped to make a 76.5bn yen (£480m) operating profit for the year, but now expects to arrive at 42.4bn yen (£270m). Konami&#x27;s revenue forecast is also down for the year, though not by as much - from 320bn yen to 303bn yen. 


The publisher is tight-lipped as to the exact reasons why it has so dramatically changed its finanical outlook, and simply stated it related to &quot;the profit plan for some titles in the digital entertainment business&quot;.

                              <span>Sony seems to be finally solving its PlayStation 5 stock issues, following a bumper Christmas sales period that saw the PS5 record its best quarter to date.


7.1m PlayStation 5 consoles were sold in the three months ending 31st December 2022, up 83 percent on Christmas 2021. Overall, Sony has now shipped 32m PS5 consoles worldwide.


Looking ahead, Sony seems confident it can continue to keep PS5 in stock, too. The company has now raised its annual PS5 target to 19m, up by a million units on what it previously expected. This means Sony expects to shift a further 6.2m consoles before 31st March.

                              <span>After four months of open beta testing, Valve&#x27;s long-promised overhaul for Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode is live for everyone, giving the ageing UI a welcome, Steam-Deck-inspired makeover.


Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode was first introduced all the way back in 2012, providing a fullscreen, controller-focused UI option specifically designed for use with TVs and controllers. Since then, revisions to Big Picture mode have been incremental at best, and Valve&#x27;s recent major overhaul for Steam&#x27;s desktop mode left Big Picture looking particularly long in the tooth.


Thankfully, in July 2021, Valve announced it would be replacing Big Picture&#x27;s increasingly musty design with the far more modern UI created for its Steam Deck handheld gaming PC, introducing an updated home screen providing easy access to recent games, universal search, a new controller configurator, and more.

Teams of hackers defend their own computers while attacking other teams’. It’s a controlled setting for what computer hackers do in real life: finding and fixing vulnerabilities in their own systems and exploiting them in others’. It’s the software vulnerability lifecycle.
These days, dozens of teams from around the world compete in weekend-long marathon events held all over the world. People train for months. Winning is a big deal. If you’re into this sort of thing, it’s pretty much the most fun you can possibly have on the Internet without committing multiple felonies...</span>

                              <span>With Monster Hunter Rise now available to players across all major platforms following last month&#x27;s PlayStation and Xbox release, Capcom is turning its attention back to post-launch content support for paid expansion Sunbreak, promising a bunch of new stuff - including a returning elder dragon - in its latest free Title Update.


Arriving next Tuesday, 7th February, Title Update 4 gives Sunbreak hunters at Master Rank 10 or above the opportunity to take on Monster Hunter World: Iceborne&#x27;s memorable - and extremely formidable - elder dragon Velkhana, which has the ability to freeze water particles in the air to create devastatingly powerful ice attacks.


Velkhana is joined by Risen Crimson Glow Valstrax - which, like the Risen Teostra, Risen Kushala Daora, and Risen Chameleos before it - has overcome the affliction to become a supremely powerful variant, available to battle from MR 160 onward. Both additions come with associated gear and skills, and can be glimpsed in Capcom&#x27;s Title Update 4 trailer below.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7000X3D gaming-focused processors finally have a release date - or rather, two release dates. The Ryzen 9 7900X3D and 7950X3D will debut on February 28th, with the 7800X3D arriving on April 6th. 
AMD announced prices for its new CPUs too, with the eight-core 7800X3D at $449, the 12-core 7900X3D at $599 and the 16-core 7950X3D at $699. For context, the original eight, 12 and 16-core Ryzen 7000 models have MSRPs of $399, $549 and $699, respectively, so this is at most a $50 premium in terms of MSRP - although of course retail prices have dropped significantly since the original Ryzen 7000 models debuted in September last year. 
All three X3D CPUs have been hotly anticipated since they were announced just after the new year, as they combine the new features of AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7000 series - an efficient 5nm process, more powerful socket and generally excellent performance - with the 3D V-Cache design that made the rather ordinary 5800X into the ridiculously powerful Ryzen 5800X3D. By tripling the chip&#x27;s L3 cache, the 5800X3D was able to compete with Ryzen 7000 and Intel&#x27;s 12th and 13th-gen designs in many games - despite being bound to older DDR4 memory and the venerable AM4 socket. That makes an X3D version of Ryzen 7000 quite a tantalising prospect for extreme gaming performance.

                              <span>Following EA&#x27;s announcement that it&#x27;s ending development on Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, it&#x27;s been reported the publisher has also cancelled an unannounced single-player game set in the Titanfall/Apex Legends universe.


That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, who, citing three people familiar with the matter, says the Respawn-developed game - internally known by the code-named TFL or Titanfall Legends - was being helmed by creative director Mohammad Alavi until he left the studio in 2021 to pursue what he called his &quot;next adventure&quot;.


Prior to his departure, Alavi had confirmed he was working on a &quot;brand-new Respawn single-player adventure&quot;, which - combined with later word from VentureBeat&#x27;s Jeff Grubb that the project was a first-person shooter with a focus on mobility and style - suggests this is the very same game now reportedly canned.

                              <span>Amensia: The Bunker, the &quot;unscripted&quot; WW1 horror from SOMA developer Frictional Games, has been delayed from its original March release window to 16th May.


The Bunker - the fourth game in the Amnesia series, following on from The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, and 2021&#x27;s Rebirth - is a bit of a departure from Frictional&#x27;s traditionally linear tales of horror, promising &quot;unscripted&quot; scares in a nightmarish semi-open-world.


Unfolding in the claustrophobic confines of a dimly lit underground bunker, Frictional&#x27;s latest casts players as Henri Clément - a French soldier hunted by an &quot;adaptive&quot; otherworldly creature. In order to escape its clutches, players - armed with a revolver and noisy dynamo flashlight - must explore and experiment, using quick thinking to deal with objects, threats, and resources that change each play through.

                              <span>Following its trundle into Texas at the end of last year, American Truck Simulator has set its sights on a new destination; the next stop on its tour of the US - following the release of its upcoming Oklahoma expansion - will be Kansas.


SCS Software confirmed Oklahoma would be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s first post-Texas expansion back in November, but the developer has now added a new stop to the driving sim&#x27;s itinerary, announcing work has begun on Kansas in a post on its website.


Kansas will be American Truck Simulator&#x27;s 13th explorable state, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and, of course, the upcoming Oklahoma expansion.

                              <span>Netflix has detailed a series of new measures to crack down on account sharing, in a desperate move to end the practice used by millions of subscribers who let friends and family log into their accounts.


The streaming service will soon designate a &quot;primary location&quot; for your account - your home - and require you watch something while connected to Wi-Fi there &quot;at least once every 31 days&quot;.


Any devices not regularly located at your primary location - something Netflix will snoop on via IP addresses and device IDs - risk being blocked from access. The suggestion here is you can play Netflix&#x27;s games on your phone while elsewhere, for example, but that some level of interaction with your home Wi-Fi will still be necessary.

Hawes previously voiced Lara in Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, along with spin-offs Lara Croft: Guardian of the Light and Temple of Osiris.

                              <span>For the past three seasons in Fortnite, players have aided chirpy AI voice AMIE as part of the game&#x27;s meandering ongoing storyline.


This week, a fresh set of narrative quests saw AMIE finally bid farewell to players - for the time being, at least - as she sets off in search of her creator, now installed in a fresh robot body. 


While this storyline has been ongoing for a while, the identity of the robot body AMIE constructs has come as something of a surprise. It&#x27;s a robot body that long-time Fortnite fans are very familiar with, as it was a playable character included in the game&#x27;s Chapter 1 Season 6 battle pass back in 2018.

                              <span>Freshly-installed DC Studios co-chief James Gunn has laid out his plan for the future of DC Comics&#x27; movie, TV and video game adaptations, and a vision to unify much of the brand&#x27;s forthcoming output into a single MCU-style continuity.


In a video statement posted to Twitter, Gunn laid out a series of films and TV series which will form the official DC Universe, or DCU, storyline and tie-in to one another. This includes a new Superman reboot without Henry Cavill, after the star was ditched by DC right after his departure from The Witcher.


Gunn also addressed the various DC projects which will still be made, but set outside the canon DCU timeline. These will be &quot;clearly labelled&quot; as such, and given the name &quot;DC Elseworlds&quot;, a phrase that has previously applied to non-canon DC comic books.

                              <span>As part of its latest Behind the Sims presentation, EA announced The Sims 4&#x27;s new infant update will be making its squishy arrival on 14th March. 


When this update goes live, it will bring with it an entirely new life stage, and a host of new activities and interactions for players and their little bundles of joy. Yes, after a brief spell of babyhood (the developers obviously don&#x27;t want to corrupt any pre-existing save files), we will have the infant stage. At last, babies won&#x27;t spend their pre-toddler days being immobile objects bound to a bassinet. 


Soon, other sims across the household will be able to pick their infants up, walk around with them, sit down with them, hand them over to other sims - you get the idea. In addition to this, the babies themselves will also have a new lease of life, with new infant-centric interactions and animations.

                              <span>Capcom is making a number of changes to Resident Evil 4 Remake from the original, including a tweak to companion character Ashley Graham.


Previously, Ashley had her own health bar and could be carried off by enemies. Now, according to new details from Game Informer (via IGN), she will no longer have a health bar.


Instead, if she takes too much damage, Ashley will be in a &quot;downed state&quot; and will need to be revived; if hit in this state she will die.

                              <span>A fresh update to Cyberpunk 2077 on PC has added support for DLSS 3, Nvidia&#x27;s upscaling technology that allows for much-improved frame-rates. 


A video released by Nvidia shows various sections of gameplay with ray-tracing effects enabled, and compares the same rig running Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS 3 switched on and off. With DLSS 3 enabled, the game&#x27;s frame-rates are more than doubled.


CD Projekt has continually worked to polish Cyberpunk 2077 since its launch over a year ago. This latest patch allows Nvidia&#x27;s frame-generating technology to lend its own hand - if you have an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU for it. You can see how it all looks below.

Yoshida&#x27;s latest post on the Lodestone follows the success of a Japanese raid team who were the first to defeat The Omega Protocol (Ultimate), a new challenging boss added in the most recent patch update.



It has since transpired the raid group was using third-party mods, so their achievement has been stripped.

The exact number of games and range of titles affected varies by country, though here in the UK it includes blockbusters such as Mass Effect 2, Dark Souls and various Assassin&#x27;s Creed entries, including Brotherhood, 3 and 4: Black Flag.


A selection of smaller-sized classics are also impacted, including Limbo, Spelunky, Castle Crashers and Peggle 2. All will be removed from digital sale.

                              <span>EA has announced the cancellation of Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, as well as the closure of developer Industrial Toys, which was working on the latter game.


News of the cancellations arrived alongside EA&#x27;s latest financial results, with the publisher saying it had opted to end development on Apex Legends Mobile - which  launched last May - because the &quot;ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations of our players&quot;.


A separate statement by Apex Legends studio Respawn Entertainment shed a little more light on the concerns surrounding the game&#x27;s development, saying, &quot;We aim to provide players with games that are consistently outstanding. Following a strong start, the content pipeline for Apex Legends Mobile has begun to fall short of that bar for quality, quantity, and cadence.&quot;

                              <span>Iron Galaxy Studios has announced its free-to-play &quot;brawler royale&quot; game Rumbleverse is shutting down on 28th February, a little over six months after launch.


Iron Galaxy first announced Rumbleverse toward the end of 2021, describing the 40-person, melee-focused battle royale game as &quot;big, hilarious playground where spectacular things are always happening&quot;. It was initially due to launch last February, but ultimately didn&#x27;t arrive until 18th August, after the studio chose to delay its release in order to &quot;perfect the experience.&quot;


Now though, just six months later, Iron Galaxy and publisher Epic Games have announced the end of Rumbleverse, confirming servers go offline on 28th February at 4pm in the UK/10am CST. All players who spent money on or in Rumbleverse are eligible for a refund, with more details on the refund process set to be shared at a later date.

                              <span>Developer Respawn Entertainment has announced a six week delay for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, confirming its highly anticipated action-adventure sequel will now launch on 28th April.


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor - the follow-up to 2019&#x27;s well-recieved Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order - was originally scheduled to launch on 17th March, but Respawn has now opted to postpone its release in order to &quot;hit the [studio&#x27;s] quality bar&quot;.


Announcing the news in a statement shared on Twitter, the developer wrote, &quot;For the last three years, the Jedi team here at Respawn has poured its collective heart and soul into Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and we are proud to say the next chapter in the tale of Cal Kestis is content complete. We are now focused entirely on the final stage: bug fixes to enhance performance, stability, polish, and most importantly, the player experience&quot;.

                              <span>Ahead of its imminent arrival in Call of Duty: Warzone 2&#x27;s second season, Activision has given a first proper look at Ashika Island, the free-to-play shooter&#x27;s previously teased new map.


Activision formally unveiled Ashika Island in a series of posts on Twitter, explaining the new &quot;small map&quot; will play host to both DMZ matches and the returning Resurgence mode - which ups the pace by dropping the player count to 40-50 and enabling respawns.


The accompanying aerial view of Ashika Island highlights a number of key points of interest - labelled as Residential, Shipwreck, Tsuki Castle, Port Asika, Town Centre, Beach Club, and Ogaikku Farms - with four of the map&#x27;s landmarks getting a more detailed reveal via the medium of screenshot and dubious haiku.

Street Fighter: Duel, a collaboration between Capcom and Crunchyroll Games, features an &quot;original story&quot; in which players take on Seth and the Shadaloo&#x27;s army of mech clones using a three-strong team assembled from over 40 possible familiar faces.


There&#x27;s representation from all across the series - the likes of Ryu, Akuma, Cammy, and Chun-Li are all confirmed as playable - and combat unfolds either in real-time or via optional auto-battling if players prefer. Expect new and returning stages as the adventure continues, with the whole thing presented in &quot;beautifully animated&quot; 2D.

                              <span>Epic Games has reversed course on its decision to make Fortnite&#x27;s weekly quests expire after seven days - a change introduced at the start of the popular battle royale&#x27;s most recent season.


Prior to the start of Chapter 4 Season 1, weekly quests would release over the course of a Fortnite season and stick around until the end. It meant you could log on at any point and complete the challenges after they were released, without the FOMO-inducing need to finish them within a set timeframe. 


Since the start of this season, however, weekly quests were changed to offer a more heavily-themed set of challenges which have just seven days to complete, including several with multiple quest steps (that Epic Games has, in a previous update, already made easier).

Specifics on the new live-service game are fairly limited right now, but The Crew Motorfest, as its name very much suggests, is themed around a &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; motoring festival (presumably even more one-of-a-kind if you pretend Forza Horizon doesn&#x27;t exist) featuring &quot;tailor-made races, themed events, and other unique challenges&quot;.


All this unfolds on the island of O&#x27;ahu, described as the &quot;perfect playground for players to have fun together in with their vehicles&quot;. The entire island will be open to explore - giving players access to the likes of volcano slopes, steep mountain roads, rainforest, and sunny beaches - with The Crew Motorfest promising &quot;hundreds of the most legendary vehicles&quot;.

Temporary staff members were also affected, with their contracts reportedly terminated with &quot;just a few days&quot; of warning.

                              <span>Members of the original development team behind the legendary GoldenEye 007 for N64 have shared their thoughts on the recent re-releases of the game for Nintendo Switch and Xbox.


Responding to a tweet by Rare, the game&#x27;s original developer, game designer David Doak questioned where the love was for &quot;the team who actually made it&quot;.


&quot;Obviously marvellous to see GoldenEye 007 re-released and I hope people have a lot of fun with it!&quot; Doak continued. &quot;But yeh, bit shabby all round that we weren&#x27;t invited.&quot;

Servers will go dark forever on 1st May 2023, only 12 months on from launch. In-game items have already been removed from sale, while the game itself will be delisted on 27th February. 


As Crimesight is an online game, this really is the end. &quot;Online battles will not be available after the service ends,&quot; Konami noted. &quot;Also, the game itself won&#x27;t be able to play,&quot; it helpfully added.

In a recent Twitter thread, the mycologist praised HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation and applauded the show for &quot;seeing this opportunity to take us on a literary adventure into the realm of sci-fi while exploiting the public&#x27;s fascination, fear, and joy of fungi&quot;. 


He went on to note that though &quot;these mixed emotions make for great writing... the sets, although apocalyptic, are strangely beautiful as nature digests the cities with flora and mycelium&quot;.

                              <span>A group of around 40 Ubisoft staff downed tools to strike last Friday, following calls by unions for workers to take action.


Staff held a meeting in the cafeteria at Ubisoft&#x27;s Paris-based development studio, where the company builds games in the Ghost Recon and Just Dance series, Axios reported.


According to a worker who was present, the discussion included talk on the current troubled state of Ubisoft, the pressures of crunch and plans for future strike action.

And its success, according to one Activision Blizzard executive, is surely all the proof the FTC needs to give Microsoft&#x27;s buyout of the company the all clear. After all, Sony is clearly doing ok.


In a fairly lengthy Twitter thread, Activision Blizzard&#x27;s chief communications officer Lulu Cheng Meservey moved to alert the FTC to the most recent episode of The Last of Us, calling the show a &quot;true blockbuster&quot;.

                              <span>Sony has slashed its planned PlayStation VR2 shipments in response to disappointing pre-order numbers, a fresh report has revealed. 

Bloomberg states Sony has cut its shipment forecast in half - down to 1m units instead of 2m - after lacklustre early interest. The company reportedly now expects to shift just 1.5m headsets total before March 2024.


PSVR2 will arrive on 22nd February with 37 games, though the vast majority are not new experiences. The headset&#x27;s price has also raised some eyebrows, with its cost totalling over £1000 when combined with the regular PS5 - and that&#x27;s without a game to play on it.

One of these logs, however, is described as being &quot;indecipherable&quot; by the game. And yet, someone has deciphered it, and now many in the Dead Space community think the text is talking about events from later Dead Space games and media.

                              <span>E3 2023 will not include a showfloor presence by Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft, a new report has claimed. 

IGN states that all three of the industry&#x27;s console makers will skip the event, putting a significant dampener on the show&#x27;s long-awaited return.


E3&#x27;s annual showcase, held in June at the Los Angeles Convention Center, has long been the video game industry&#x27;s key marketing drumbeat.

                              <span>Nintendo Switch indie exclusive Sports Story has been updated to remove its criticism of game development, which was hidden away within an in-game secret room.


A sequel to the beloved Golf Story, Sports Story itself featured a rocky development, and was originally due to release in 2020. It eventually arrived right at the end of last year, albeit to a lukewarm reception and launch day bugs.


The subsequent discovery by fans of an in-game room - ostensibly a game development office filled with unhappy workers - raised eyebrows at the time. Exploring the room uncovers particularly pointed barbs between co-workers relating to project delivery time, writing feedback and bug-testing.

Along with the recent news it will be working on and publishing the next Tomb Raider game, fresh reports state the company also has plans for both a film and TV series based on the globe-trotting and pistol-wielding Lara Croft. 


Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, sources state Phoebe Waller-Bridge, known for Fleabag and Killing Eve, is attached to write a Tomb Raider TV project, which is still in the &quot;development stages&quot;. However, the actor does not plan to star in the adaptation.

Don&#x27;t Nod Montreal, the satellite studio formed by key developers behind the original Life is Strange and its sequel, posted the image on Twitter over the weekend amid a call for staff to join the &quot;new narrative game&quot; project.


The image shows a CRT TV, a VCR and a stack of video tapes, and a cartridge-based video games console that looks to be from the SNES era.

But when asked if an XCOM 3 might be next on the agenda after that, Solomon said he had &quot;no information&quot; and no &quot;secret agenda&quot; for saying so.

                              <span>A new Super Mario Bros Movie clip has been released by Nintendo and Illumination.


This snappy little number gives us another look at the film&#x27;s upcoming power ups, with Mario suiting up as a cat to do battle. It also lets us hear Seth Rogen&#x27;s take on Donkey Kong. And, well, it sounds like Seth Rogen.


The setting for this little teaser will be familiar with those who have been following the film&#x27;s trailers so far. It is the same airborne colosseum-like arena that we saw Mario getting bashed about in by Donkey Kong before. The new video, which you can see below, is titled Smash. So, Smash Bros?

Digital Foundry&#x27;s John Linneman highlighted the problem via Twitter at the weekend, and showcased how darker sections of the game&#x27;s environments &quot;basically lose most of their detail&quot;. 


&quot;The actual resolution is much higher... but VRS causes shadowed regions to basically lose most of their detail,&quot; John wrote, calling for an option to be able to disable VRS on PC as well.

In an eye-opening Twitter thread, Microsoft chief communications officer Frank X. Shaw claimed Sony was &quot;briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision&quot;.


&quot;Nothing could be further from the truth,&quot; he continued, before restating a number of Microsoft&#x27;s familiar arguments.

In a tribute shared via Deadline, Wersching&#x27;s husband Stephen Full said she would find &quot;wonder in the simplest moment&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t require music to dance&quot;.


&quot;There is a cavernous hole in the soul of this family today. But she left us the tools to fill it,&quot; he wrote.

                              <span>Episode three of The Last of Us is remarkable. Remarkable because, despite giving us a look at moments that aren&#x27;t actually in the game, it still manages to capture the tone and feel of it all perfectly. It embellishes on the show&#x27;s theme of love in a world that is crumbling. In all honesty, it took my breath away. 

That&#x27;s not to say that episode three won&#x27;t be controversial. While it does expand on the series&#x27; story in its own way, there are elements from the game that those who have played will likely miss, and I&#x27;m confident there will be plenty of discourse on this episode. 

So, without further ado, let&#x27;s dive on in and take a closer look at the third episode of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation, &#x27;Long, long time&#x27;.

Do the proposed changes support different use cases in various sectors, types, and sizes of organizations (and with varied capabilities, resources, and technologies)?
Are there additional changes not covered here that should be considered?

                              <span>Blizzard has outlined what changes it has planned for Overwatch 2&#x27;s third season.

In a brief blog post shared on the official website, director Aaron Keller admitted that the new Ranked mode &quot;suffered from poor comprehension&quot;, acknowledging that there was &quot;confusion around players&#x27; real rank and how that translated to skill level, difficulty forming groups with friends, and a negative impression of the matchmaker when players of different ranks were put in the same match&quot;.

&quot;We will be implementing some changes in S3 and quite a few more in S4 all aimed at creating more clarity in the system. More details on short-term changes and long-term vision will be coming soon,&quot; Keller said.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has reaffirmed the company&#x27;s commitment to the Halo franchise, insisting that the series remains &quot;critically important to what Xbox is doing&quot;.

In an interview with IGN, Spencer stressed that the series will &quot;always be iconic for Xbox&quot; despite the &quot;missteps that [they] made as a team&quot;.

&quot;What we&#x27;re doing now is we want to make sure that leadership team is set up with the flexibility to build the plan that they need to go build,&quot; Spencer explained. &quot;And Halo will remain critically important to what Xbox is doing, and 343 is critically important to the success of Halo.

All four are playable on PS4 consoles, whilst OlliOlli World, Destiny 2: Beyond Light, and Evil Dead: The Game are optimised for PS5, too.

As is usually the case, the news comes via our old pal Billbil-kun who has been reliably leaking the PS Plus freebie line-up via a French forum for months now.

It says that whilst PUBG &quot;continues to be a major priority&quot;, &quot;the company’s efforts in 2023 to develop a deeper catalogue of titles and stay ahead of rapid advances in tech will drive new processes and internal efficiencies toward essential growth&quot;.

Talking to Game Informer (thanks, NME), creative director James Worrall and lead narrative designer Khan teased that the skill deck is &quot;even better&quot; than a skill tree, enabling players to change loadouts &quot;mid-air&quot;.

&quot;There&#x27;s a skill deck… which is even better,&quot; Khan said when asked if the sequel would feature an upgradeable skill tree.

                              <span>In-game footage reportedly taken from Guerilla&#x27;s upcoming Horizon Forbidden West co-op mode has leaked online. 

After Guerilla&#x27;s recruitment-focused Twitter feed, we already knew that the studio&#x27;s co-op dreams were still alive, with the company actively hiring for an internally developed &quot;separate online project&quot; in the Horizon universe that will focus on &quot;new cast of characters and a unique stylised look&quot;, and allow friends to &quot;explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together&quot;.

Now it seems that that &quot;stylised look&quot; is available for all to see thanks to leaked footage allegedly taken from a &quot;Horizon Forbidden West alpha multiplayer&quot; test.

                              <span>Forza Motorsport has reportedly been delayed from its previously announced &quot;spring 2023&quot; release date on Xbox Series X/S and PC to &quot;Q3 maybe even a little bit later&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to Giant Bomb&#x27;s Jeff Grubb, speaking during the latest episode of his Game Mess Decides podcast (thanks VGC). &quot;I feel pretty good about this after asking around a couple of times after hearing it the first time earlier today,&quot; Grubb explained. &quot;It does seem like Forza is going to slip later into the year and probably won&#x27;t be the first half of the year...The timeframe I&#x27;m hearing for Forza is like Q3, and maybe even a little bit later than that.&quot;


Microsoft had initially given Forza Motorsport a &quot;spring 2023&quot; release window when it was announced in June last year. However, when the game re-emerged during this week&#x27;s Developer Direct showcase, many were quick to notice that, rather than announcing a launch date, Microsoft had instead revised Forza Motorsport&#x27;s release to a far broader &quot;2023&quot;.

                              <span>Spoon-wielding Pokémon Kadabra will be returning to Pokémon: The Card Game for the first time in over two decades this June, following illusionist, magician, and spoon-bender Uri Geller&#x27;s decision to drop his long-running lawsuit against the character.


Geller first sued Nintendo in November 2000, claiming the spoon-bearing Kadabra - known as &quot;Yungerer&quot; or &quot;Yungeller&quot; in Japan - was an unauthorised appropriation of his identity. That initial California lawsuit was dismissed in 2003, but additional lawsuits reportedly continued outside the US, and Kadabra has remained absent from Pokémon: The Card Game since 2002.


Then, in 2020, Geller had a change of heart, dropping all remaining legal action and &quot;giving [Nintendo] permission to relaunch the Uri Geller Kadabra/Yungeller worldwide.&quot; He also told fans, &quot;I am truly sorry for what I did 20 years ago...I am releasing the ban. It&#x27;s now all up to Nintendo bring my Kadabra Pokémon card back.&quot;

                              <span>Mushroom fans rejoice! HBO has confirmed its critically acclaimed live-action TV adaptation of The Last of Us will be returning for a second season.


It&#x27;s perhaps not particularly surprising news; The Last of Us has proven both a critical and ratings smash since it premiered on 15th January. Shortly after the show&#x27;s debut, HBO announced it had become the network&#x27;s second most-watched premiere in over a decade, with 4.7m viewers tuning in for the first episode - a figure that&#x27;s since quadrupled, garnering over 18m views in the space of a week. Episode 2, meanwhile, secured the largest week-two audience growth for an Original drama series in HBO&#x27;s history. 


And now, just under three weeks into The Last of Us&#x27; first season, HBO has confirmed there&#x27;s more on the way. &quot;I&#x27;m so grateful to [The Last of Us co-creator] Neil Druckmann and HBO for our partnership,&quot; showrunner and series writer Craig Mazin said of the news, &quot;and I&#x27;m even more grateful to the millions of people who have joined us on this journey&quot;.

                              <span>Battlefield 2042&#x27;s long-awaited Class update, which rework&#x27;s the beleaguered shooter&#x27;s much-maligned Specialists system into something more closely resembling classes from previous Battlefield games, will launch next week, developer DICE has confirmed.


DICE announced it would be overhauling 2042&#x27;s Specialists last August, saying feedback on the &quot;polarising&quot; system had highlighted concerns around &quot;the loss of Class Identity, and a shift from familiar gameplay flow that [players] were used to.&quot;


As it previously explained, the goal of DICE&#x27;s Class update is to give Specialists defined roles and an arsenal of gadgets, equipment, and weapon proficiencies suited to their specialisations. To that end, once 2042&#x27;s 3.2 update arrives next week, players can choose from either Assault, Engineer, Recon, or Support. A far lengthier explanation of the upcoming changes can be found in DICE&#x27;s blog post from last year.

                              <span>If you had been hoping to watch HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us adaptation, but don&#x27;t subscribe to the necessary services to do so, I have good news. You can now watch the first episode for free via Sky TV&#x27;s YouTube channel.


This is, of course, a clever way for Sky and co. to keep generating interest and hype for the series. It did the same thing with its Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon, and will likely do the same thing with future shows down the line.


Even so, it is a great opportunity for fans of the games (or those totally new to the series) to get a little taster of what the The Last of Us TV team has been cooking up. So, without further ado, you can follow the link here to watch episode one of The Last of Us. Enjoy!

                              <span>GoldenEye 007 is now available on both Nintendo Switch and Xbox, but it turns out cheats work slightly differently across the two versions.


N64 players will remember the likes of DK mode, paintball mode, and the Aztec and Egyptian secret levels, which were unlocked by completing missions within difficulty and time limit conditions. Alternatively, they could be unlocked by inputting cheat codes.


However, while those cheat codes still work on the Switch version, they are not compatible with the Xbox version.

                              <span>Ubisoft is reportedly working on both Far Cry 7 - its next mainline release in the series - and a standalone Far Cry multiplayer game.


This news originated from Insider Gamer, but has since been corroborated by Kotaku. Sources state Ubisoft head Yves Guillemot referenced both of these upcoming Far Cry releases during an internal company update last week. 


Additionally, the same sources revealed that Far Cry 7 (known internally as Project Blackbird) is being made with Ubisoft&#x27;s Snowdrop engine, which is the same engine being used for its Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game. Just as a general point of interest, the most recent entries in the Far Cry series used the Dunia engine.

                              <span>It is widely accepted that if a nuclear blast were to unleash over us, we would not live to tell the tale (unless you are Indiana Jones and you happen upon a surprisingly sturdy fridge. Yeah, I didn&#x27;t buy that either). 


However, somehow, the couple at the start of Fallout 4 manage to survive the game&#x27;s opening nuclear blast, and remain unscathed by the heat flash that would have hit them (not to mention, those looking right at the blast would likely be blinded at the very least). 


So, while Fallout 4&#x27;s introduction is certainly an impactful one, it is not exactly known for its realism. Well, that is, until now. Thanks to modders, we can now start a new game of Fallout 4... and not survive the introduction.

                              <span>Hasbro is set to lay off approximately 1,000 people from its global workforce this year in an effort to cut costs, around 15 percent of global full-time employees.


This is to achieve its goal of delivering $250-300m in annualised run-rate cost savings by the end of 2025.


&quot;The elimination of these positions will impact many loyal Hasbro employees, and we do not undertake this process lightly. However, the changes are necessary to return our business to a competitive, industry-leading position and to provide the foundation for future success,&quot; said CEO Chris Cocks.

                              <span>Bungie has released a blog post explaining the reasoning behind an outage of the game this week that&#x27;s caused players to lose progress.


On 24th January, Hotfix 6.3.0.5 was released but Bungie later announced it would be taking the game offline to &quot;investigate an ongoing issue causing certain Triumphs, Seals, and Catalysts to lose progress for players&quot;, as per this tweet.



Now the game is back up and running, but players have lost progress in the process and purchases during this time have been refunded.

                              <span>Motive has detailed the accessibility options for Dead Space. 


The remake, which was released today, has a variety of features that players can implement at their will. These include narratable menus, a range of subtitle options, controller customisation, five difficulty settings and a colourblind mode. You can see how many of these options look in the video embedded below. 


In addition to these features, the Dead Space developer has also added an optional content warning feature. With this feature in use, players will be informed about any upcoming in-game content that they could find upsetting. This is done &quot;by displaying a non-intrusive popup that gives a brief description of the type of event that&#x27;s waiting around the corner, or in an audio or video log before you play it&quot; (see header image above).

                              <span>Road 96, the acclaimed narrative adventure from developer Digixart, is getting a prequel, and it&#x27;s coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC on 4th April.


As a quick refresher, the original Road 96 served up  procedural road trip adventure - set during a long, hot summer in the mid-90s - in which players hitchhiked across the ever-changing authoritarian nation of Petria in an attempt to reach the border and start a new life. We liked it a lot at Eurogamer, awarding it a Recommended badge.


Its newly announced prequel, officially titled Road 96: Mile 0, rewinds the clock just a little bit further to tell a tale set just prior to the events of the first game. This time, players can explore White Sands, described as Petria&#x27;s only luxurious community, switching between protagonists Zoe and Kaito - two teenagers from significantly different backgrounds.

                              <span>Developer Fntastic has rebuffed suggestions from increasingly vocal detractors that The Day Before - its now twice-delayed and seldom seen open-world zombie survival MMO - is a scam, saying, &quot;When the game comes out, people will finally see the truth.&quot;


The Day Before was revealed back in 2021, with a striking trailer that helped propel it to the top of  Steam&#x27;s most wishlisted games chart. Since then, though, its journey to release has been less than smooth. Its initial June 2022 release date was delayed by a year when Fntastic suddenly announced it was switching development to Unreal Engine 5 less than a month before its planned arrival, then earlier this week, with just two months to go before its revised launch date, the developer pulled the game&#x27;s Steam listing and announced another delay - pushing its release back a further nine months, this time blaming a trademark dispute.


Throughout all this, very little has actually been seen of The Day Before beyond its initial announcement trailer, a 13-minute gameplay video revealed several months later, and 59-seconds of additional gameplay at the start of this year. All of which has lead to a rise in suggestions around the internet the game may not even be in development at all.

But those who play GoldenEye 007&#x27;s soon-to-launch re-release on Nintendo Switch and Xbox may notice the watch music sounds a little different than they remember it did on the N64 back in the 90s.


Yesterday, Nintendo tweeted a clip of the watch music from the Nintendo Switch version of the game. Give it a listen:

                              <span>Pharaoh: A New Era - publisher Dotemu and developer Triskell Interactive remake of Impressions Games&#x27; classic Ancient-Egypt-themed city builder - finally has a launch date and is coming to PC on 15th February.


The original Pharaoh, which released in the hazy mists of 1999, gave players the opportunity whizz back through time and participate in 15 centuries of Ancient Egyptian history, coaxing their fledging nomad settlements into bustling cities in classic management sim style.


At first it&#x27;s just a matter of constructing a  logistically sound network of housing, roads, and simple amenities to satisfy citizens&#x27; needs, but soon considerations around the likes of economy, trade, health, agriculture, education, culture, religion, and warfare come into play.

In an interview with BuzzFeed, the developer acknowledged fans are eager to hear more about the prospect of a third story in its The Last of Us series. However, Druckmann was keen to stress that just because something is successful, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it needs a sequel.


Druckmann stated Naughty Dog is in a &quot;very privileged position&quot; with Sony, with the publisher &quot;[supporting the studio] every step of the way to follow [its] passions&quot;, meaning it wasn&#x27;t feeling any pressure to make a sequel.

                              <span>Activision is making significant changes to Warzone 2.0, and a lot of it sounds like going back to Warzone 1.


While Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 enjoyed a massive launch late last year, player dissatisfaction has grown since then. While we don&#x27;t have concurrent player numbers on console, according to SteamDB, Modern Warfare 2 player numbers have dropped off steadily following a peak in early November.


In a blog post, Activision outlined what changes Warzone 2.0 players can expect when Season 2 launches on 15th February.

                              <span>Things aren&#x27;t looking good for FaZe Clan&#x27;s market value. The organisation of esports professionals and gaming influencers began trading on Nasdaq (an American based stock exchange) last July, becoming one of only a few esports companies on the market.


However, just six months down the road, its stock is dropping and then dropping some more. 


In fact, at the time of writing, its stock is sitting at $0.75 per share (see header above).

                              <span>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 launched with a user interface that was widely panned by players. With the launch of Season 2 on 15th February, Activision hopes that sentiment will change.


The interface used to navigate between Modern Warfare 2, Warzone 2.0 and DMZ is a tile interface some have compared to Netflix or Hulu.

Perhaps worse than that is the in-game menu system, which makes it difficult to work out where you are or where you&#x27;re meant to go to get to what you want.

The 2023 Design Future London Schools Challenge is a partnership between City Hall, Microsoft&#x27;s Minecraft Education, and C40 Cities, and invites students to redesign Croydon town centre as a &quot;greener, safer, and more prosperous place for everyone&quot;.


Khan features in the game as a non-player character to introduce the challenge.

                              <span>EA and Motive&#x27;s Dead Space remake will have a New Game Plus mode included on its release. 


The Dead Space team has kept details on this new mode fairly brief so far, but has confirmed it will come with a Level 6 Advanced Suit (nice), New Phantom Variant Necromorphs (scary) and, perhaps most interestingly, a secret ending (ooh).


This secret ending will more than likely link to the &quot;Reunion&quot; trophy that Vikki reported on last week. To get this achievement, players will need to &quot;see the alternative ending on any difficulty mode&quot;.

According to a blog post, the popular player versus AI versus enemy extraction mode will get what sounds like a progression wipe, and will be made easier.

&quot;All-new missions are coming to Season 02 including a refresh of your current faction mission progress and an inventory (contraband and keys) reset,&quot; Activision said. &quot;We will be detailing all the need-to-know intel for DMZ ahead of Season 02 in an upcoming blog.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has detailed the latest batch of titles heading to Xbox Game Pass between now and early February, including Golden Eye, Hi-Fi Rush, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition for consoles, Darkest Dungeon, Hot Wheels Unleashed, and more.


Hi-Fi Rush is, of course, developer Tango Softworks&#x27; freshly announced (and rather splendid-looking) rhythm adventure, which comes to Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Cloud via Game Pass today. That&#x27;ll soon be joined by the legendary GoldenEye 007, which gets a gentle spruce-up for Cloud and Xbox on 27th January, 


Next up are the Game Preview version of rogue-lite first-person shooter Roboquest (coming to Xbox on 30th January), plus Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition - which gets a long-awaited console release, complete with controller support and new tutorials, on 31st January.

                              <span>EA has reportedly added loot boxes to the latest playtest build of its highly-anticipated new Skate project, tying them to earnable in-game currency in a manner seemingly consistent with its previous promise of there being no paid loot boxes in the game.


EA made that particular pledge last July, when it announced its Skate revival would be a free-to-play live-service game. At the time, developer Full Circle attempted to assuage fan fears by insisting the game&#x27;s monetisation would be &quot;mostly about cosmetics and convenience&quot;, promising no pay to win mechanics or paid gameplay advantages, no paid gameplay elements or areas of the map, and no paid loot boxes.


Given those assurances, players were a little perturbed when, not long after Skate&#x27;s free-to-play announcement, dataminers uncovered evidence of loot-box-like Swag Bags - purchasable with &quot;Taps&quot; and containing randomised apparel - in a version of Skate&#x27;s playtest source code.

                              <span>That&#x27;s a wrap on the Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct, and the first big video game showcase of 2023. The show gave us a lot of what we&#x27;d expected, all that had leaked and, well, no surprises, really. Here are all the announcements, trailers and news Microsoft had to offer.
Developer Direct kicked off with a look at Minecraft spin-off Minecraft Legends and its PVP experience. It&#x27;s out 18th April 2023 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S and of course, Game Pass. Here&#x27;s Tom&#x27;s Minecraft Legends preview, if you want to know more. The new trailer is below:
Moving on to Turn 10&#x27;s Forza Motorsport. It&#x27;s got fully dynamic time of day and weather - a first for the series - and over 500 cars. This one launches at some point this year on PC and Xbox Series X and S. Here&#x27;s the trailer:

                              <span>Following a bit of a leak ahead of Microsoft&#x27;s Developer Direct showcase, Tango Gameworks has formally unveiled its latest project, Hi-Fi Rush - a rather glorious-looking rhythm adventure that&#x27;s getting a surprise release today on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass.


Hi-Fi Rush - which follows the eye-searingly colourful escapades of wannabe rockstar Chai and his pet cat - is quite the departure from Tango&#x27;s largely horror-focused previous output (which includes the likes of The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo), trading spooks for something considerably more exuberant.


Calling to mind some of Sega&#x27;s classics (Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robinson excitedly described it as &quot;PNO3 meets Jet Set Radio Future&quot; at one point during its unveiling this evening), Hi-Fi Rush is a rail-swinging, robot-pummelling adventure that all unfolds to the rhythm of its music.

Tonight&#x27;s Xbox Developer_Direct gave us a fresh look at the game, including its fire station safehouse which appeared to be a place you pick up missions and head out to explore its world. 


We saw footage of a player battling a &quot;Shroud&quot; vampire which cloaks the local area in darkness, giving the appearance of a more arena-style fight in close quarters.

In Minecraft Legends, PVP is a cross-platform affair for up to eight players, split into two teams. Each team&#x27;s objective is to capture and destroy their opponent&#x27;s base, while building up defences around their own. 


As in the main Legends campaign, PVP areas are procedurally generated - a nod back to the vanilla Minecraft. Also included are the Piglins, PVE enemies who act as a third faction intent on frustrating both sides.

                              <span>With Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s seasonal festivities now well and truly over, developer Gameloft is turning its attention the village life sim&#x27;s year ahead, promising the likes of multiplayer, Encanto, and more in a new content roadmap.


While multiplayer is perhaps the most notable (and intriguing) addition for Disney Dreamlight Valley in 2023, there&#x27;s little to report until Gameloft is ready to say more than just that single word. Thankfully, the rest of its roadmap is more illuminating, starting with the fact the early access game&#x27;s next update is scheduled to arrive in February.


This introduces an &quot;exceptionally unexceptional&quot; new villager - revealed to be Encanto&#x27;s Mirabel Madrigal in the accompanying picture - plus a &quot;special snowman&quot; linked to new secrets in the Frosted Heights biome. And if that&#x27;s not pointing to Frozen&#x27;s Olaf then I&#x27;m all out of ideas.

                              <span>January&#x27;s dragging on, it&#x27;s stil cold and miserable out so let&#x27;s cheer ourselves up by getting together to see a good old-fashioned showcase. There&#x27;s a new format from Microsoft tonight that might be kind of familiar given the name, and it promises fresh looks at Redfall, Elder Scrolls Online, Minecraft Legends and - you can probably tell this is the one I&#x27;m most excited for - the rebooted Forza Motorsport. There should be a little more besides, too, going from recent leaks - so join us from 8pm GMT for all the fun!

In an open letter from chief product officer Tom Verrilli and chief monetisation officer Mike Minton, the pair detail new products set to launch in the first half of the year.


&quot;Our main focus for the year is your growth - both for your communities and for your earnings on Twitch,&quot; they said.

The game will launch in Japan tomorrow, but until now the release outside of Japan was simply summer 2023.

Those playing through Nintendo&#x27;s service will have access to its single-player campaign - that takes us from the snow covered vistas of its &#x27;Surface&#x27; levels to the lush jungle of, well, its &#x27;Jungle&#x27; level - and also be able to take part in its multiplayer both locally and online.


Those on Xbox, meanwhile, will have access to the campaign and its four-player split screen multiplayer. This is an updated version of GoldenEye 007 for Xbox consoles, and will include achievements, 4K resolution, a smoother framerate and alternative control options. In short, I know what I am doing on Friday night.

The inaugural PS5 edition of the game was delayed in November due to &quot;unforeseen circumstances which arose during the submissions and approval process&quot;.



The game will also have a 20 percent discount for PlayStation Plus subscribers until 14th February, a discount consistent with the pre-order incentive prior to the initial intended release.

The game originally released in 2007, before PlayStation trophies existed. It was one of the first classics available on PS Plus at launch last year, and the first PSP game to be added.

The reason for this fairly sizable delay? The developer claims it did not trademark the game&#x27;s name and now someone else has done so instead. 


Last night, many of those who had wishlisted The Day Before on Steam noticed it had been removed from the platform.

                              <span>Minecraft developer Mojang has introduced a major new armour customisation feature for the game&#x27;s latest PC test build. 


The catchily-named snapshot 23w04a includes the ambitious Armour Trim Smithing feature, which lets you visually customise the game&#x27;s blocky armour. 


To do this, you&#x27;ll need to find a consumable Smithing Template for the customisation type you want, plus a smattering of resources to determine the colour you desire.

                              <span>Fresh images have emerged of the Fallout TV series set, revealing the iconic Red Rocket gas stations for the first time.


These aren&#x27;t official images, but have been taken from the set that&#x27;s still under construction and shared online by Twitter user J Carson (thanks PC Gamer).


The images show the rundown gas station surrounded by rusting vehicles. The signage may be wrapped up but is still clearly recognisable, even without the typical giant red rocket on top.

                              <span>Staff at Activision Blizzard studio Proletariat have dropped plans to form a union following alleged &quot;confrontational tactics&quot; by its CEO.


The Boston-based Proletariat officially became part of Activision Blizzard in July last year, with its staff put to work on veteran MMO World of Warcraft.


Last month, a group of 57 staff members announced plans to form the Proletariat Workers Alliance, a union seeking flexible time off, remote work as a permanent option, better communication over pay and assurances overtime would never be mandatory.

This morning, Squanch Games announced via Twitter that it had received Roiland&#x27;s resignation at the beginning of last week. Ongoing support for the Xbox Game Pass hit will continue. 


At the same time, Rick and Morty&#x27;s US network Adult Swim confirmed it had cut ties with Roiland, though his popular animated show would continue. Roiland voiced both title characters, and their roles will now be recast.

                              <span>Following a record breaking Q1 last year, Microsoft has announced a 13% drop in Xbox gaming revenue for its latest quarter, but says that Game Pass has reached &quot;new highs&quot;.


In its latest earnings report covering the current financial year&#x27;s second quarter, ending 31st December 2022, Microsoft confirmed a 13% reduction in gaming revenue compared to the same quarter last year (thanks Windows Central), highlighting declines in first-party content and lower monetisation in third-party content.


It also noted a 12% decrease in revenue from Xbox content and services, alongside a 13% reduction in Xbox hardware revenue - although all drops were largely in line with previous expectations, with the reduction attributed to a strong prior year in FY22 Q2. That quarter saw Microsoft launch Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, and Age of Empires compared to its most recent quarter, where Xbox&#x27;s sole first-party title was Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s Pentiment.

Journey to the Savage Planet, developed by 
Typhoon Studios (now Racoon Logic), launched to much acclaim in 2021, with Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake calling it a &quot;genuinely funny toybox to explore&quot; in her Recommended review.


505&#x27;s newly announced Employee of the Month Edition will bundle up Journey to the Savage Planet&#x27;s base game and Hot Garbage DLC, and throw in a range of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S exclusive features too.

                              <span>Developer Fatshark has delayed Warhammer 40,000: Darktide&#x27;s upcoming Xbox Series X/S release, saying it has made the decision to spend the next few months solely addressing fan feedback after the game &quot;fell short&quot; of expectations.


When Darktide launched on PC in November, Eurogamer&#x27;s Chris Tapsell applauded its &quot;stupendous atmosphere and vicious action&quot; in his review, but called its release &quot;scrappy [and] rickety...arriving with bugs and technical difficulties and making huge demands of PCs&quot;.


Issues around Darktide&#x27;s launch have coalesced to the point it&#x27;s now accrued a damning &#x27;mostly negative&#x27; recent reviews rating on Steam from nearly 8,500 players, and Fatshark has moved to acknowledge the community&#x27;s mounting frustration in a statement shared on Twitter.

                              <span>Mimimi Games, the studio behind the superb Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blade of the Shogun, has unveiled its latest foray into the world of stealth-strategy: zombie pirate adventure Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew.


Shadow Gambit, which unfolds in an alternative Golden Age of Piracy, sees players setting sail across the Caribbean in a living ghost ship known as The Red Marley. Along the way, they&#x27;ll assemble a crew of cursed pirates with supernatural powers - all of which should come in handy in the fight against the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden and the hunt for the treasure of the legendary Captain Mordechai.


It&#x27;s a top-down tactical adventure set in a &quot;dynamic, immersive sandbox&quot;, with players able to freely choose the islands they visit and the missions they tackle from their hub-like ship. Entry and exit points on islands can be established ahead of time, and different crew mates can be taken into battle, depending how players want to approach the challenges ahead.

                              <span>Riot has offered an update to last week&#x27;s cyber attack on its systems, confirming that while source code for League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics is currently being held ransom, it remains &quot;confident&quot; no player data was compromised.


Riot first shared news of the attack - said to have targeted its development environment - last Friday, saying that while the incident would temporarily affect its ability to release content, there was &quot;no indication that player data or personal information was obtained.&quot;


The studio has now reiterated that point in an update on Twitter, saying it &quot;remains confident&quot; no player data was impacted. It also revealed further information on the attack, saying that - following the &#x27;exfiltration&#x27; of source code for League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, and a &quot;legacy anticheat platform&quot; - the perpetrators have now contacted Riot in a ransom email. &quot;Needless to say,&quot; it added, &quot;we won&#x27;t pay.&quot;

                              <span>Life is Strange 2 will launch for Nintendo Switch on 2nd February, publisher Square Enix has announced. 


The narrative adventure series&#x27; second game originally arrived episodically on other platforms between 2018 and 2019, and tells the story of two brothers on a roadtrip across America following a family tragedy.


It received a more mixed reception than the series&#x27; first game, which featured high school time travel antics and a different set of characters. But for those who are still yet to play Life is Strange 2, it is still worth a look.

If you do, you will be presented with a rather unassuming little mushroom button (or should that be button mushroom?) at the bottom of your search page. 


But while this button may seem unassuming at first - with its depiction looking more like something from a Mario game -  if you push it your screen will soon be overcome by the cordyceps infection. And the more you push it, the more the infection will spread. Lovely!

                              <span>Don&#x27;t expect to get your hands on The Lord of the Rings: Gollum any time before April.


In Nacon&#x27;s latest earnings report, the publisher stated the game will now release in the first half of FY 2023-24. This means we are looking at some time between April and September this year. For those keeping track, this  means Gollum has been delayed yet again.


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been a long time coming. While it was initially meant to release in 2021, its launch has seen several setbacks and delays. Most recently, we were told its once-expected September 2022 launch was getting pushed back to an unspecified date in 2023, but only by a &quot;few months&quot;. However, since then all has been quiet.

The late-game area features decaying ruins floating in the sky among tornados and is the home to a number of iconic boss fights.


Now, instead of dragons, you can find Spartans engaging in shootouts between the crumbling stones.

Clarke comes with a handy health-tracking back bling that reacts to Isaac taking damage - just as in the survival horror series. You can also own the engineer&#x27;s plasma cutter as a pickaxe, and equip a dinky model of the necromorph-ridden USG Ishimura.


If you fancy adding Isaac to your Fortnite locker, his set of items comes priced at £9.99, with 1500 V-Bucks of in-game Fortnite currency included. 1500 V-Bucks is also typically worth £9.99, so you&#x27;re basically paying up for those and getting the skin as an added freebie. (Yes, I did buy it from Fortnite&#x27;s in-game store last night.)

                              <span>CD Projekt Red&#x27;s own Paweł Sasko has stated fan criticism about Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s relatively linear story is &quot;completely justified&quot;.


While there are several options for players to choose from throughout the game that in turn curate different experiences for different players (for example, starting off on either the Nomad, Street Kid, or Corpo lifepaths or its five different endings), many felt Cyberpunk 2077 should have given more - especially given how much was promised ahead of the game&#x27;s release. 


Sasko, chatting on his Twitch channel (via PCGamesN) was asked by one viewer, &quot;How do you feel about players criticising the game for being linear?&quot; To this, the developer replied that it was &quot;completely justified&quot;, before elaborating further.

As Ohshima explains in his tweet, he made a draft of an action game about twin brothers who &quot;protect the dream world from Nightmare World&#x27;s boss&quot; called Thirteen - a concept which later evolved into Sonic.


The twin brothers themselves have spiky hair - one red and one blue - while the environment features a very familiar looking loop de loop.

The call to strike comes in response to ongoing discontent at the publisher, inflamed this month by comments from Ubisoft&#x27;s CEO Yves Guillemot following a round of troubling financial results.


Two unions, the video game workers&#x27; union (STJV) and digital technology union Solidaires Informatique, have now called on employees at Ubisoft&#x27;s Parisian headquarters to strike this week, French newspaper Libération reported today.

The policy in question reportedly states managers at Blizzard are obliged to give a low &quot;Developing&quot; rating - something that could impact an employees financial status and future promotion potential - to a certain percentage of its staff in order to meet a quota laid out by parent company Activision Blizzard.


In an email seen by Bloomberg, Birmingham stated when Blizzard team leads questioned this policy, the &quot;World of Warcraft directors explained that while they did not agree, the reasons given by executive leadership were that it was important to squeeze the bottom-most performers as a way to make sure everybody continues to grow&quot;.

It means Sony may be forced to reveal confidential information on its future plans it would likely prefer to keep quiet.


The subpoena was issued on 17th January with a response date of 20th January, though this has been extended until 27th January for Sony to &quot;move to limit or quash or otherwise respond to the subpoena&quot;.

                              <span>Following HBO&#x27;s announcement last week that The Last of Us was its second most-watched premiere in over a decade, the broadcaster has revealed that Episode 2 secured the largest week-two audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in its history.


As reported by Variety, a combination of official figures and data gathered by Nielsen points to a viewership of 5.7 million on HBO and HBO Max for The Last of Us&#x27; second episode, which marks a 22% increase on the premiere&#x27;s 4.7m viewers. That number, obviously, does not factor in audience figures outside the US.


HBO has previously said Sunday night viewership for one of its shows typically represents 20-40% of an episode&#x27;s gross audience, meaning its latest Episode 2 figures are likely to grow substantially. Episode 1, for instance, has now nearly quadrupled its initial audience, securing over 18m views in the space of a week.

                              <span>Sega has launched a mysterious new website that appears to be teasing a revival of cult arcade and Dreamcast release Cosmic Smash.


Cosmic Smash, which initially launched back in 2001, saw players traversing a futuristic subway-style map, with each &quot;stop&quot; on the line challenging them to clear blocks at the end of a long room within a time limit, using a ball and racquet - making for an experience somewhere between Breakout and squash.


And now, after a 22-year absence, it looks like Cosmic Smash is making a return. Sega released a teaser - along with the words &quot;eye c sth forming&quot; - on its social media channels earlier today, all pointing to a website with &quot;csmashvrs&quot; in its URL.

                              <span>Supermassive Games has announced a three-week delay for Dark Pictures: Switchback VR, which is now expected to release on 16th March.


Switchback VR - a spiritual successor to Supermassive&#x27;s gaudy, rollercoaster-like PSVR rail-shooter Rush of Blood - was originally due to be a PSVR 2 launch title when the headset arrives on 22nd February, but the studio has now opted to push back its release to ensure the &quot;most polished, terrifying experience possible&quot;.


&quot;Switchback VR is Supermassive Games&#x27; most ambitious VR project to date,&quot; the developer wrote in a statement shared on Twitter, &quot;taking players through five extensive worlds that branch through various terror filled rollercoaster routes based on The Dark Pictures franchise&quot;.

                              <span>Thunderful Games has unveiled SteamWorld Build - the latest entry in its acclaimed, genre-hopping SteamWorld series - which promises to serve up a mix of &quot;SimCity with Dungeon Keeper&quot; when it comes to PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and Switch later this year.


Build is the SteamWorld series&#x27; first 3D outing and challenges players to construct a city while also sending their workers to explore foe-packed mines below ground in order to keep a steady supply of building resources incoming.


Thunderful says there&#x27;ll be a narrative component to the whole thing - the ultimate goal is to build a rocket to escape the planet before it shatters (events in Build run concurrently to those in SteamWorld Dig 2) - and you can get a closer look at its intriguing action in the studio&#x27;s announcement livestream, as well as in Christian Donlan&#x27;s very encouraging initial impressions.

                              <span>If you are one of the many who play GTA Online via your PC, here is a word of warning. There have been reports of users having their accounts corrupted or blocked, as well as stats being removed and reversed in the game, due to the actions of opportunistic cheaters.


These security vulnerabilities have been picked up on by the prolific Rockstar Games-focused account Tez2 (via PCGamer). 
The user states it is essential PC players only play GTA Online with a firewall rule in place (they recommend Speyedr&#x27;s Guardian) to protect their game. Or, better still, avoid playing all together until these issues are resolved by Rocksar.

                              <span>EA is battling leaks of its Dead Space remake ahead of its release later this week.


A video of the game&#x27;s opening two hours was posted on YouTube and swiftly removed by EA. A follow up video uploaded was later removed too.


The video was reportedly of PlayStation 5 footage and was available to watch for a considerable amount of time before EA removed it.

                              <span>Sales of The Last of Us Part 1 surged last week, thanks to the launch of HBO&#x27;s new TV adaptation.


Sony&#x27;s recent PlayStation 5 re-release shot back into the UK boxed game chart top 20, with a 238 percent rise in copies sold versus the week before (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz).


It wasn&#x27;t enough to trouble last week&#x27;s new launch from Nintendo, Fire Emblem Engage, but it is worth noting that this sales data does not include digital downloads. It&#x27;s likely that many more copies of The Last of Us will have been shifted digitally, whereas Nintendo&#x27;s own releases typically skew more towards boxed copies.

                              <span>In HBO&#x27;s TV adaptation of The Last of Us, Tess is played brilliantly by Australian actress Anna Torv. Her version of Tess is calm but assertive, clearly calling the shots between her and Joel. 


Now, in a new podcast about the show&#x27;s second episode, co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin discussed how they were going to elaborate on Tess&#x27;s character and story further. 

Please note, there are spoilers for The Last of Us below.

                              <span>Mac Walters, one of the architects of BioWare&#x27;s Mass Effect franchise, has moved on from EA&#x27;s famed RPG studio.


Walters publicly confirmed his departure over the weekend, after more than 19 years at the company. Beginning as a writer on Jade Empire, Walters took a more senior role on the original Mass Effect, before serving as lead writer for the trilogy&#x27;s second and third installments. 


&quot;With a new year comes new adventures,&quot; Walters wrote in a post on LinkedIn. &quot;As some of you already know, at the end of last year I decided to leave BioWare. These past 19 years have been a life-changing experience to say the least, and it made the choice to go very difficult.&quot;

                              <span>Anime action RPG Granblue Fantasy: Relink has a new trailer - but it&#x27;s still without a release date.


Publisher Cygames announced Granblue Fantasy: Relink in August 2016 as an ambitious co-production with Bayonetta developer PlatinumGames. But in February 2019, Cygames announced it had ditched Platinum and would handle development itself.


In December 2020, Cygames announced a 2022 release window for the PlayStation 5 as well as the PlayStation 4. Obviously that didn&#x27;t pan out, with the delay blamed on the pandemic. A 2023 release window was announced in its stead.

We last saw Ellie and Joel, along with Anna Torv&#x27;s Tess, fleeing FEDRA soldiers patrolling the QZ. As they ran off into the darkness, the unmistakable noise of a clicker could be heard reverberating through the ruined city, giving us a haunting sense for what&#x27;s to come. 
So, without further ado, let&#x27;s take a closer look at episode two of The Last of Us (which, incidentally, marks Neil Druckmann&#x27;s TV directorial debut).

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has reached out to Xbox staff across the company, acknowledging that it&#x27;s been &quot;a difficult week&quot; and that while &quot;this week&#x27;s actions were painful choices&quot;, it &quot;set [Xbox] up for the long-term success of our products and business&quot;.

The email - which was shared by Kotaku - follows Microsoft&#x27;s enormous round of 10,000 layoffs that impacted several Xbox studios, including Halo studio, 343 Industries.

&quot;This has been a difficult week across Microsoft, and here, inside our teams. Now that many of the 1:1 and team conversations have happened, I want to take a moment to reiterate the message that you heard from your leaders,&quot; Spencer&#x27;s email began.

                              <span>Physical copies of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will shortly be available to buy for PS5 and Xbox Series X.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition is set to release in Europe, North America, and &quot;select&quot; - albeit unspecified - territories from 26th January, 2023.

The release comes hot on the heels of the digital release, which rolled out for new-gen consoles last month as a free upgrade for anyone who already owned the last-gen version. It also included new items and a quest inspired by the Netflix The Witcher show.

                              <span>Dead Space Remake is reportedly so scary, even members of the development team are struggling to play it. 

In an interview with PLAY magazine (thanks, GamesRadar+), technical director David Robillard admitted that they struggled to play it at night with headphones because &quot;it&#x27;s just too fu*king scary&quot;.

&quot;When I&#x27;m playing it at night, I can&#x27;t play it with headphones. It&#x27;s just too fu*king scary,&quot; Robillard said. &quot;Just the amount of realism and, again, atmosphere. Not just visually, right? In the way we handle sound, ambience, effects, having systems that will try to spook you.

After a little back and fore between Polish outlet Parkiet and CDPR&#x27;s communications team to clarify whether &quot;biggest&quot; referred to the game&#x27;s budget or scope, it&#x27;s now been confirmed to be the former.

This was further emphasised by community director Marcin Morton on the game&#x27;s Reddit community - &quot;this [...] is about the biggest budget when it comes to expansion packs we&#x27;ve released&quot; - and then again by global PR director Radek Grabowski, who tweeted to confirm the team meant that it was the biggest DLC by budget, not necessarily in-game content.

                              <span>It looks like Dead Space Remake will have an alternate ending.

Whilst not formally confirmed by EA nor the development team at Motive, according to the game&#x27;s lightly spoilery trophy list - which have recently gone up on True Trophies (thanks, TheGamer) - you can unlock a trophy called &quot;Reunion&quot;, an achievement that pops when you &quot;see the alternative ending on any difficulty mode&quot;.

Unsurprisingly, we&#x27;re not told anything else about the alternate ending or what it entails, but it should be exciting news for OG Dead Space fans who may recall that no such achievement was available in the original game.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s latest patch introduces New Game Plus.

Striking Distance Studios announced the new feature in its latest patch notes, confirming that as part of its v.3.01 patch, players who kick off a new game on a completed game save will be able to access all their weapons, upgrades, and outstanding Callisto Credits when they first visit a Reforge.

The feature is now live on PC and consoles, along with the usual bug squishes and tweaks to improve performance and resolve issues. In fact, &quot;general optimisations across all platforms&quot; have been deployed, along with a fix to the &quot;The Protocol is About Life&quot; achievement that had not been popping for all players.

                              <span>Bethesda has sent out a mysterious letter that hints at what&#x27;s next for its MMO, The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO).

The letter - which has been sent out to media and ESO streamers - is signed by Leramil the Wise and addresses the recipient as &quot;proxy&quot;. And whilst there&#x27;s nothing on the letter or envelope that identifies the game or developer by name, fans have been quick to put the pieces together.

&quot;Proxy,&quot; the letter begins. &quot;The tide of fate swirls around you with glorious fury and has chosen you to serve as its surrogate in a crisis most perilous. The future of at least two worlds hands in the balance. Your talent for changing destiny has been noticed, hence the reason for this letter.

                              <span>It looks like Stadia-exclusive horror Gylt will shortly release on other platforms.

Whilst not confirmed formally by Rime developer Tequila Works, a tweet on the studio&#x27;s official Twitter channel posted cover art from the game with the word &quot;soon&quot;.

Back in October - when Google confirmed plans to shutter its cloud gaming service Stadia, which closed down earlier this week - Tequila Works confirmed its formerly Stadia-exclusive action-adventure Gylt would be going multiplatform next year. But whilst we knew it was coming to other systems, the studio had said very little else… until now, anyway.

                              <span>Big changes are on the way to ghost hunting sim, Phasmophobia, including a full progression wipe in order to usher in a new levelling system.

In a Steam update earlier this week, Kinetic Games outlined what was ahead for intrepid ghosthunters when V8.1 &quot;and onwards&quot; roll out later this year, including new difficulties, challenge mode, and a shop update.

Noting that any and all information remains a work in progress and is subject to change at any time, Kinetic confirmed that &quot;progress part 1; V9.0&quot; will be the next &quot;major&quot; update, coming &quot;shortly&quot; after v.8.1 rolls out.

                              <span>Publisher’s Weekly  reviewed A Hacker’s Mind—and it’s a starred review!
“Hacking is something that the rich and powerful do, something that reinforces existing power structures,” contends security technologist Schneier (Click Here to Kill Everybody) in this excellent survey of exploitation. Taking a broad understanding of hacking as an “activity allowed by the system that subverts the… system,” Schneier draws on his background analyzing weaknesses in cybersecurity to examine how those with power take advantage of financial, legal, political, and cognitive systems. He decries how venture capitalists “hack” market dynamics by subverting the pressures of supply and demand, noting that venture capital has kept Uber afloat despite the company having not yet turned a profit. Legal loopholes constitute another form of hacking, Schneier suggests, discussing how the inability of tribal courts to try non-Native individuals means that many sexual assaults of Native American women go unprosecuted because they were committed by non-Native American men. Schneier outlines strategies used by corporations to capitalize on neural processes and “hack… our attention circuits,” pointing out how Facebook’s algorithms boost content that outrages users because doing so increases engagement. Elegantly probing the mechanics of exploitation, Schneier makes a persuasive case that “we need society’s rules and laws to be as patchable as your computer.” With lessons that extend far beyond the tech world, this has much to offer...</span>

                              <span>Here’s a new video of a giant squid, filmed in the Sea of Japan.
I believe it’s injured. It’s so close to the surface, and not really moving very much.
“We didn’t see the kinds of agile movements that many fish and marine creatures normally show,” he said. “Its tentacles and fins were moving very slowly.”

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

                              <span>Crystal Dynamics is reportedly preparing to announce the end of development on its beleaguered live-service superhero action-adventure Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, with official news said to be due &quot;as early as next week&quot;.


That&#x27;s according to reliable Marvel&#x27;s Avengers leaker Miller Ross, who, citing sources at Crystal Dynamics in a story for Exputer, says the studio had initially intended to continue supporting the game into the back half of 2023, but recent events surrounding lead developer Brian Waggoner - who has reportedly now left the company after he was found to have posted racist, ableist, and homophobic tweets - has accelerated the project&#x27;s demise.


Ross&#x27; sources say Waggoner will not be replaced following his departure, leaving only a &quot;small team&quot; of developers still working on Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, most of whom are already sharing their time with other Crystal Dynamics projects, including Amazon&#x27;s Tomb Raider.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re one of those sorts that prefers the comforting heft of a box and disc to the intangible nothingness of a digital release, CD Projekt has you covered with news that The Witcher 3: Complete Edition is getting a physical release on PS5 and Xbox Series X next week.


The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition launches physically across Europe and North America on 26th January, bundling together the acclaimed base game and its previously released DLC - including expansions Heart of Stone &amp; Blood and Wine, plus 16 bits of additional content. It also features all quality of life improvements and extras added in December&#x27;s next-gen update, including a new quest, quick Sign casting, a photo mode, new camera options, cross-platform progression, and more.


Unsurprisingly, the update&#x27;s next-gen bells and whistles make the transition to disc too, introducing the likes of faster loading times, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution support, and a choice between Performance and Ray Tracing modes on Xbox Series X and PS5.

                              <span>Google Stadia is now, sadly, dead. But that doesn&#x27;t mean Destiny players who used Google&#x27;s streaming service need to hang up their headsets just yet. 


Indeed, Destiny developer Bungie is in the process of contacting former Stadia players to offer a month&#x27;s access to GeForce Now, Nvidia&#x27;s rival cloud gaming platform which is still very much alive. 


Did you ever play Destiny 2 via Stadia? If so, it may be worth double-checking your inbox today for a voucher code to use GeForce Now for 30 days. The offer will expire on 19th February, 9to5Google reported today.

In an interview with Game Pressure, the studio&#x27;s CEO Feargus Urquhart discussed the future of the Fallout series and admitted Obsidian had spoken to James Cameron&#x27;s team.


&quot;Avatar 2 just came out and James Cameron spent 10 or 15 years making it. Back then, we were talking with them about making an Avatar 2 game... I don&#x27;t even know how long ago. Eight, six years, something like that,&quot; said Urquhart.

                              <span>Google has become the latest technology company to announce mass layoffs, as it today told employees it was eliminating 12,000 roles.


Employees were informed of the redundancies this morning via email, in a message from Google and Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai that was also posted to the company&#x27;s blog. 


Titled &quot;A difficult decision to set us up for the future&quot;, the post blamed the job losses on &quot;difficult economic cycles&quot;. Google previously hired staff based on the &quot;dramatic growth&quot; it had seen over the past two years, Pichai  stated, which now did not reflect the &quot;economic reality&quot; today.

However, it appears the release still contains bugs from the game&#x27;s poorly received release in 2021.


All three games are currently available as a bundle and individually with 50 percent off as part of a larger Rockstar sale, but reviews from Steam users are mixed.

Katrina Leonoudakis worked on the games at Sega until her departure from the company, and said she had urged the publisher to ensure the games&#x27; translation team made it into the game&#x27;s credits. 


&quot;I am absolutely outraged. I was the Localisation Coordinator on the project up until I left Sega, constantly in connection with the FIGS teams,&quot; Leonoudakis wrote on Twitter last night. &quot;I told the team who took over for me to credit the FIGS team. They worked incredibly hard to localise TWO GAMES. Unbelievable.

One of the original Warzone&#x27;s best and most popular features was its 1v1 Gulag, which gave players a straightforward battle in a tight arena to potentially fight their way back onto the battle royale map after death.

                              <span>Wizards of the Coast has apologised for its handling of its Dungeons &amp; Dragons Open Gaming License (OGL) revisions, which caused a huge community backlash over the past week.


Details of planned revisions for an OGL 1.1 were leaked by Gizmodo, and Wizards of the Coast was immediately faced with an orchestrated pushback by fans and prominent community members over rule changes which would, among other things, require anyone making money through the use of D&amp;D elements to report earnings to the company.


The original OGL, which was to be rendered &quot;unauthorised&quot; after the release of 1.1 according to Gizmodo&#x27;s report, granted non-Wizards of the Coast publishers relative free rein over the use and sale of content which utilised D&amp;D&#x27;s existing elements.

This post warns Devops from a false sense of security. Following security best practices when developing and configuring microservices do not result in non-vulnerable microservices. The post shows that although all deployed microservices are vulnerable, there is much that can be done to ensure microservices are not exploited. It explains how analyzing the behavior of clients and services from a security standpoint, named here &quot;Security-Behavior Analysis&quot;, can protect the deployed vulnerable microservices. It points to Guard, an open source project offering security-behavior monitoring and control of Kubernetes microservices presumed vulnerable.

                              <span>Amplitude Studio&#x27;s Dungeon of the Endless spiritual successor Endless Dungeon - which it calls a &quot;unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense&quot; - has been given a release date and will launch for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation on 18th May.


Endless Dungeon, which was announced toward the end of 2020, shipwrecks players on a mysterious space station and tasks them with recruiting a team of heroes in an effort to transport a crystal to their vessel&#x27;s core, protecting it - via some frenetic top-down twin-stick shooting action - from ceaseless waves of monsters along the way.


It features a new storyline set in the Endless universe, and can be played either solo - one player controlling the entire squad - or alongside friends in multiplayer, with available heroes including Comrade (Gunsmith), Bunker (Tank), Blaze (Artificer), and Shroom (Medic).

                              <span>After its year-long delay, EA Sports PGA Tour finally has a release date, and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 24th March.


EA Sports PGA Tour - which marks the publisher&#x27;s first golfing sims since 2015&#x27;s Rory McIlroy PGA Tour - was officially unveiled back in March 2021, with an anticipated launch window of &quot;spring 2022&quot;. However, in March last year, EA made the decision to push its release back an entire 12 months, although no reason was given at the time.


With its launch now in sight, however, EA&#x27;s PR machine is back in action, and today&#x27;s release date news is accompanied by a brand-new trailer highlighting EA Sports PGA Tour&#x27;s new Pure Strike shot system, which the publisher says incorporates &#x27;fluid swing mechanics, innovative ball behaviour, and lifelike course dynamics&#x27;.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns&#x27; superhero crew is expanding by one on 26th January, when Deadpool enters the fray as the acclaimed strategy game&#x27;s first paid DLC addition.


At launch back in December, Midnight Suns featured a 12-strong base game roster of playable heroes, consisting of Blade, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Hulk, Iron Man, Magik, Nico Minoru, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, and Wolverine.


However, publisher 2K confirmed shortly before release that Midnight Suns&#x27; line-up would begin to expand in early 2023, when Deadpool arrived in the first of four planned post-launch DLC packs. That pack has now been given an official name - The Good, The Bad, and The Undead - the aforementioned 26th January release date, plus more details on what it&#x27;ll include.

                              <span>December brought the surprise news that Dead Cells - the superb rogue-like action-platformer from developers Motion Twin and subsidiary Evil Empire - would be joining forces with Konami to release a paid Castlevania expansion, and we&#x27;ve now been given a first proper (if rather brief) look at its retro-inspired action courtesy of a first gameplay trailer.


Previously described by Evil Empire as &quot;our very own love letter to the granddad of Dead Cells&quot;, Return to Castelvania - as the expansion is officially known - will usher in two new biomes inspired by the Konami platforming classic, taking to players through the spooky outskirts and candle-lit interior of Dracula&#x27;s Castle.


As they journey deeper into Vlad&#x27;s pad, brave adventurers will face enemies from all across the Castlevania series, including mermen, bone throwers, haunted armour and, as one of three bosses to grace the DLC, Dracula himself. Thankfully, there&#x27;s a whole new arsenal of familiar weapons to experiment with, ranging from the Vampire Killer and Throwing Axe to Holy Water.

                              <span>With a little over a month to go until the release of PlayStation 5&#x27;s spruced-up virtual reality kit, PSVR 2, Sony has revealed the full 37-game launch window line-up players can expect to arrie between 22nd February and the end of March.


That list has steadily been growing since PSVR 2&#x27;s official unveiling late last year, and today brings news of 13 previously unannounced additions. These newcomers include GoodbyeWorld Games&#x27; Before Your Eyes - an &quot;emotional&quot; adventure in which players control the narrative through a world of memories by blinking - and Kayak VR: Mirage, giving players the opportunity to paddle through ice caves in Antarctica, accompany dolphins in Costa Rica, survive a thunderstorm in Norway, and roam canyons in Australia.


These are joined by Pavlov VR - which makes the jump from PC with &quot;realistic weapon interactions and attachments&quot;, plus competitive and social game modes - plus Puzzling Places, a &quot;relaxing and wholesome&quot; 3D jigsaw puzzler featuring &quot;hyper-realistic miniatures of beautiful places from around the globe.&quot;

                              <span>Paradox Interactive and Triumph Studios have announced a new numbered sequel in the Age of Wonders series - the first for nine years. 


Age of Wonders 4 will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 2nd May this year, and revive the franchise&#x27;s strategy empire-building and tactical combat. It also marks a return to the series&#x27; more traditional fantasy setting, following its dabbling with sci-fi in 2019&#x27;s Age of Wonders: Planetfall. 

Here&#x27;s a quick first look:

                              <span>New research suggests that warnings for games with loot box-style mechanics are inconsistent and unreliable.
Conducted by Leon Y Xiao in co-operation with universities in Denmark, London and the US, the study examines a randomised selection of smartphone games which have loot boxes and are available to download from the Google Play Store. The study aimed to find out how consistent loot box presence warnings are across PEGI and the ERSB, as well as the consistency of age ratings on the Google Play Store as overseen by the IARC.
In August last year, Xiao looked into the implementation of Belgium&#x27;s loot box ban, and concluded that the country&#x27;s legislation had proved ineffective.

                              <span>NetEase staff have smashed up a giant World of Warcraft statue by their studio, as the ongoing and increasingly bitter dispute between it and Activision Blizzard continues.


Earlier this week, Activision Blizzard revealed it was now seeking a new Chinese publisher as its current deal with NetEase, its long-standing local operator in the country, concludes this month in a war of words - and now hammers. Controversially, Activision Blizzard claimed it had offered NetEase a six-month extension to its contract - and said it was a &quot;pity&quot; NetEase had not taken up its offer.

In response, staff at NetEase have seemingly made their feelings clear - by taking mallets to a large World of Warcraft sculpture and tearing it down, before sipping on NetEase-branded drinks. The event was even livestreamed on social media to some 30,000 people, according to a report by WOWHead.

&quot;Riot Games implemented strategic shifts within a few teams to sharpen our focus in a number of areas. With these shifts, certain roles were eliminated, impacting a total of 46 Rioters.  This is part of our normal course of our business: We periodically make changes to our structure and our teams based on what we believe will allow us to deliver the best content and experiences for players,&quot; reads a statement from Riot to Eurogamer.
&quot;We never make these decisions lightly and will always start from a place of wanting to retain Rioters and have them focus on our highest priorities. While that&#x27;s not always possible, it&#x27;s our primary goal.&quot;

This comes after Straley was not credited in HBO&#x27;s TV adaptation of the game, despite his key role in Naughty Dog&#x27;s critically acclaimed release.


Speaking to the LA Times, Straley addressed this snub from the showrunners, calling it an &quot;argument for unionisation&quot;.

                              <span>When Naughty Dog first came up with its introduction for The Last of Us, the developer considered having players start by controlling Joel rather than his daughter, Sarah. 


In a new post about the game&#x27;s opening, Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann stated the begining of The Last of Us was &quot;one of the last things&quot; the team finalised ahead of its release. This was because of these initial plans for you to play as Joel from the off.


The team ultimately decided this idea felt too similar to other games from the same genre, and it wanted to set The Last of Us apart from the rest.

                              <span>More military documents have been leaked on the War Thunder forum this week - not once, but twice.


Leaking classified military documents has sadly been a frequent occurrence in the forums of the MMO combat game, most recently last June, by demanding players who expect realism from the game.



Earlier this week, military documents relating to the F-16 fighter jet were shared by a player attempting to win an argument.

                              <span>Pokémon are banned across a sizable swathe of Cyprus. There isn&#x27;t a physical wall to keep them out - at least not in most areas. But in Pokémon Go a large area across the width of the Mediterranean island is still a Pokémon no-Go area, thanks to the country&#x27;s past.


Before being contacted by Pokémon Go players based in Cyprus, I admit to being pretty ignorant of the island&#x27;s recent history, and how its geography remains shaped by the after-effects of the country&#x27;s 1974 Greek-backed coup and subsequent Turkish-led invasion. 


History lesson aside, the country remains divided by a United Nations Buffer Zone, a red ribbon on maps that cuts across the middle of the country. The internationally unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus lies to the north, while in the south sits the island&#x27;s larger Greek Cypriot-dominated region. Between the two sits the Buffer Zone - an area which on paper sounds like a hazard, but in reality is home to 10,000 people - where Pokémon cannot spawn naturally.

                              <span>The Last of Us made its TV debut earlier this week, with reception so far praising the show for its faithful adaptation of the game it is based on. 


However, there are some areas of the show that deviate slightly from Naughty Dog&#x27;s original telling of Joel and Ellie&#x27;s story. The most notable of these, which was announced ahead of the show&#x27;s release, was that there would no longer be spores spreading the Cordyceps infection. 


Now, upcoming dialogue between Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie (shared as part of the BBC&#x27;s audio review of the series) has revealed another way the virus can spread in the show. Please note, the below contains spoilers for The Last of Us.

                              <span>Google has officially pulled the plug on its cloud gaming service Stadia, which died earlier this morning.

Announced in September, the shutdown was scheduled for 7:59am 19th January for us Brits, or 11:59pm 18th January Pacific Time. If you head to the Stadia website now, you&#x27;ll be greeted with a short message which reads: &quot;Thank you for playing with us. Stadia was shut down on January 18, 2023.&quot;
Some players commemorated the occasion by livestreaming their final moments on the service which, although somewhat anticlimactic, marked the end of Stadia&#x27;s short and troubled lifetime.

Last week, Ubisoft announced it had cancelled three &quot;unannounced&quot; titles and delayed its vapourware pirate ship game Skull and Bones yet again, on top of the four projects it previously abandoned last summer. 


Now, Eurogamer can confirm that Project Q was one of the games that Ubisoft most recently ditched.

Staten will remain at Microsoft but is no longer at its Halo studio 343 Industries, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier stated last night, after joining the company to ensure the beleaguered Halo Infinite made it out the door.


Last night, reports indicated that Microsoft&#x27;s enormous round of layoffs would impact several Xbox studios, with 343&#x27;s Halo Infinite campaign team in particular &quot;hit hard&quot;, according to Schreier.

Patrick Wren, former senior multiplayer designer on Halo Infinite (and now working at Respawn on Jedi Survivor), was one such former employee who criticised the &quot;incompetent leadership up top&quot;.

                              <span>This week, developer Respawn published a blog post pulling the curtain back on Apex Legends skill-based matchmaking, or SBMM. In the blog post, technical director Samy Duc dives deep into the inner workings of the battle royale&#x27;s matchmaking system, explaining in granular detail why players end up facing the players they do. It&#x27;s a fascinating exploration of one of the key features of any competitive multiplayer game, and Apex Legends players have certainly enjoyed the transparency.


As a Call of Duty player, I couldn&#x27;t help but look at Respawn&#x27;s blog post and wish Activision would do something similar.


Call of Duty SBMM has been a topic of discussion for years, and with each new release in the series, the same vociferous back-and-forth emerges. I&#x27;ve reported on COD SBMM numerous times, usually when players get so disgruntled with it that they start to play the game in silly ways, such as deliberately losing in a bid to matchmake against lower-skilled players in subsequent lobbies. Activision has always taken a dim view of third-party websites and apps that let players try to game the system, too.

                              <span>A group of Swiss researchers have published an impressive security analysis of Threema.
We provide an extensive cryptographic analysis of Threema, a Swiss-based encrypted messaging application with more than 10 million users and 7000 corporate customers. We present seven different attacks against the protocol in three different threat models. As one example, we present a cross-protocol attack which breaks authentication in Threema and which exploits the lack of proper key separation between different sub-protocols. As another, we demonstrate a compression-based side-channel attack that recovers users’ long-term private keys through observation of the size of Threema encrypted back-ups. We discuss remediations for our attacks and draw three wider lessons for developers of secure protocols...</span>

Additional bathroom clutter comes courtesy of The Sims 4&#x27;s sensibly titled Bathroom Clutter Kit, which promises to embrace the &quot;mess of daily life&quot;. It&#x27;s not all about chaos though; EA says to expect everything from &quot;cute wall decals for kids to grandma&#x27;s dentures&quot;, with enough scope among its addition to create an &quot;elegant retreat&quot; as well as an untameable toiletry explosions.


&quot;Whether you want to leave makeup and combs scattered on the counter or give your Sims some additional drawers to keep them tidy,&quot; it explains, &quot;the choice is yours with this collection, featuring bathroom decor for all ages.&quot;

                              <span>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has reportedly apologised for telling employees &#x27;the ball was in their court&#x27; following disappointing financial results in the company&#x27;s most recent quarter. However, senior management is also said to have rejected calls - highlighted in a recent union statement - for inflation-matching pay rises and a transition to a four-day week.


Guillemot&#x27;s controversial comments to Ubisoft staff came in an email last week, when he wrote, &quot;Today more than ever, I need your full energy and commitment to ensure we get back on the path to success. I am also asking that each of you be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we&#x27;re being as efficient and lean as possible. The ball is in your court to deliver this line-up on time and at the expected level of quality, and show everyone what we are capable of achieving.&quot;


Guillemot is said to have addressed his choice of words - which many saw as a shifting of blame for Ubisoft&#x27;s recent troubles onto employees - during a company-wide Q&amp;A session held earlier today, as reported by Kotaku citing sources present during the meeting.

                              <span>Following a couple of morse code teases earlier this week, SteamWorld developer Thunderful Games has announced it&#x27;ll be revealing &quot;what&#x27;s next for the series&quot; in a special video showcase scheduled to air on Monday, 23rd January.


To date, Thunderful has released five, radically different instalments in the celebrated SteamWorld series: SteamWorld Tower Defense, SteamWorld Dig 1 &amp; 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest. A sixth game, SteamWorld Headhunter, was announced in 2021.


Little is known about Headhunter, but the developer described it as a &quot;stylised and colourful, third-person co-op action adventure&quot; at the time of its unveiling, noting it would mark the SteamWorld series&#x27; first foray into the heady world of 3D.

                              <span>FuturLab&#x27;s marvellous hose-&#x27;em-up PowerWash Simulator has set its sights on a new target in need of a clean, this time whisking players away to the world of Tomb Raider as part of a free update coming to PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on 31st January.


PowerWash Simulator, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, arms players with assorted pumps, nozzles, and climbing equipment then sets them loose across a broad selection of scruffy environments in need of a good clean - from fire stations and treehouses to subterranean public loos. It&#x27;s weirdly, wonderfully satisfying stuff, and surprisingly relaxing too.


PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s incoming crossover, officially titled the Tomb Raider Special Pack, gives players access to five new levels in as part of a new mini-campaign, including a sprawling version of Croft Manor so utterly filthy, it&#x27;s hard not to wonder what Lara&#x27;s been up to.

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is gearing up for a 2023 that&#x27;ll see it celebrating five years of pirate adventure out on the waves, but before all that, it&#x27;s hoisting anchor and setting sail with a mid-season update bringing pet rocks, a new limited-time adventure, and more.


Starting with that &quot;and more&quot;, a major chunk of Sea of Thieves&#x27; new update - which arrives tomorrow, 19th January - is dedicated to improving the matchmaking system introduced as part of the game&#x27;s new on-demand PvP functionality at the end of last year.


Eye-wateringly long wait times have been a major complaint since the feature&#x27;s arrival in Season 8, and Rare is looking to remedy the issue by, firstly, allowing same-faction battles when matchmaking is taking to long. It&#x27;s also introducing what it calls &quot;cross-stamp migration&quot; to make it easier for players to be paired. Some additional information on the changes can be found in a dev blog from December.

The PC release of the PlayStation 5 exclusive was heavily rumoured throughout last year before being confirmed for an &quot;early 2023&quot; release at The Game Awards in December.



A PlayStation Blog for the release also includes PC specs.

                              <span>Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto once vetoed a developer&#x27;s idea to introduce an evil Wario version of Princess Peach. 


The concept for a Wario-style Peach was originally discussed 15 years ago by Shugo Takahashi, co-founder of Mario Tennis and Mario Golf studio Camelot in an old interview with Nintendo Dream. 


This interview resurfaced last night via Twitter, as translated by user gosokkyu, which has brought Takahashi&#x27;s long-lost comments to light.

For the unfamiliar, GeoGuessr is a browser game that drops players somewhere in the real world and tasks them with pinpointing their exact location on a map.


Now, thanks to reddit user TheEdenChild, there&#x27;s an Elden Ring version that drops players into The Lands Between.

The issue? Marvel&#x27;s Avengers already has a Marvel Cinematic Universe-inspired Thor with a helmet on, while this is being sold separately and for a relatively substantial amount of money. 


On his own, helmetless MCU Thor costs 1400 Credits (around $14), or comes at 500 Credits (around $5) if you already own the helmeted version (thanks, ComingSoon).

Now the developer has added Gunsport to Hyper Gunsport on PC via Steam&#x27;s beta channel.

                              <span>Launched just weeks ago, ChatGPT is already threatening to upend how we draft everyday communications like emails, college essays and myriad other forms of writing.
Created by the company OpenAI, ChatGPT is a chatbot that can automatically respond to written prompts in a manner that is sometimes eerily close to human.
But for all the consternation over the potential for humans to be replaced by machines in formats like poetry and sitcom scripts, a far greater threat looms: artificial intelligence replacing humans in the democratic processes—not through voting, but through lobbying...</span>

                              <span>Comparative chart fans rejoice! Sony has published its annual list of top PlayStation Store downloads, revealing exactly what punters in the US, Canada, and Europe were plopping onto their PS4 and PlayStation 5 hard drives in 2022.


Of no real surprise, FIFA once again dominated in Europe, with FIFA 23 securing pole position on both consoles. Over in the US and Canada, however, big balls were swapped for big guns, as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 took the lead across both platforms.


God of War Ragnarök was also, unsurprisingly, a big winner on PlayStation 5, coming in as the third biggest download of 2022 in Europe (after Modern Warfare 2) and the second biggest download in the US/Canada. It was way down the PS4 list, however, scoring 9th place in the US/Canada and 15th place in Europe.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive&#x27;s sci-fi strategy game Stellaris is expanding once more, this time with a new Story Pack DLC focused on civilisations&#x27; early encounters with alien visitors.


First Contact, as the newly announced DLC is known, will be Stellaris&#x27; fifth Story Pack - mid-sized expansions designed to expand the game&#x27;s narrative potential - following on from Leviathans, Synthetic Dawn, Distant Stars, and Ancient Relics.


&quot;For countless ages,&quot; says Paradox in a bout of scene-setting, &quot;your people have looked to the stars with wonder - is there anybody else out there? When we meet, will they be friends or enemies? Will we be the ones to discover them, or are they already here, hiding in plain sight?&quot;.

                              <span>Anno 1800, Ubisoft&#x27;s superb Industrial-Revolution-era city builder, is making the jump from PC to Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 on 16th March.


Anno 1800&#x27;s launch on current-gen systems will mark the first time in the series&#x27; 25-year history that a core instalment has been available on consoles, and strategy fans are in for a bit of a treat - it&#x27;s a wonderfully rich city builder, tasking players with establishing a thriving logistical network between the Old and New Worlds of the 19th century in order to facilitate their expansion.


Console players that opt for Anno 1800&#x27;s Standard edition gain access to everything in the base game, which includes a sizeable story campaign, sandbox, plus PvP and co-op modes. The console version also promises a reworked UI designed specifically for controller input, plus all free improvements and quality of life features released on PC over the last four years.

                              <span>Google has launched its previously promised Bluetooth controller update tool, enabling players to wirelessly connect their controllers to other devices once the embattled game streaming service shuts down tomorrow, 18th January.


Previously, Stadia controllers could only be used with the service, but - following requests from owners that the restriction be lifted in light of Stadia&#x27;s closure - the company last week announced it would shortly be releasing a tool to do just that.


That &quot;self-serve&quot; tool is now live and accessible through a Chrome web browser, but does come with a number of limitations and restrictions.

&quot;Today more than ever, I need your full energy and commitment to ensure we get back on the path to success,&quot; Guillemot wrote in an email to staff last week. &quot;I am also asking that each of you be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we&#x27;re being as efficient and lean as possible. The ball is in your court to deliver this line-up on time and at the expected level of quality, and show everyone what we are capable of achieving.&quot;


In response to those comments, the Ubisoft Paris chapter of workers union Solidaires Informatique has now called for strike action on Friday, 27th January, writing, &quot;The ball is in our court (but the money stays in his pocket)&quot;.

                              <span>No, Leatherface won&#x27;t be leaving Dead by Daylight, despite rumours to the contrary.


A previous tweet from Twitter account DbDLeaks implied that Leatherface would be leaving the horror game due to Friday the 13th licensing issues.


However, developer Behaviour Interactive has debunked the rumour with a statement to Eurogamer.

It&#x27;s set for release later this year on PC and &quot;more platforms&quot;, with a demo due during the forthcoming Steam Next Fest from 3rd February. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us earned the network its second-biggest premiere since 2010, behind only last year&#x27;s debut for House of the Dragon. 


In the US, 4.7 million viewers tuned in for the series&#x27; first episode on Sunday, Deadline reported. We&#x27;re still waiting to hear word from UK broadcast partner Sky Atlantic for viewing figures here. 


How does that compare? Putting House of the Dragon aside for a moment, The Last of Us is HBO&#x27;s biggest non-Game of Thrones launch since 2010&#x27;s Boardwalk Empire, which managed 4.81 million viewers - only slightly more.

For the PS5 demo, &quot;various technical issues&quot; have been fixed including locked-on enemies that move off-screen and lose their locked-on status. The demo will also get button mapping functionality, and has had some of its text sizes adjusted. 


On PC, fans now have a set of meaty technical specifications to hit if they want to play Forspoken on its Ultra settings: an Nvidia GeForce 4080 or AMD Radeon 6800 with 32GB memory, for 2160p and 60fps. Further details are given in the below PC trailer.

                              <span>With less than two days to go until Stadia&#x27;s full shutdown, owners of Google&#x27;s failed cloud gaming service are bracing themselves for the end. 


Over the weekend, Google unveiled a final surprise: Worm Game, a colourful version of Snake used within the company for testing purposes. Now, Stadia&#x27;s remaining fans are fighting for the top spot on Worm Games&#x27; leaderboard before everything gets switched off forever (thanks, The Gamer).


Its unclear how many players are still actively using their Stadia console, but screenshots show at least a hundred have dipped in to try Google&#x27;s farewell release, which also includes a credits screen for the service.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the next game from Batman Arkham developer Rocksteady, will include a battle pass system focused on cosmetic items, it&#x27;s been claimed. 


A leaked image apparently showing the game&#x27;s main menu appeared online last night, spread via Twitter and reddit, and has now been verified as real and recent by VGC, apparently taken from a PlayStation test build. 


The screenshot includes a menu with a &quot;battle pass&quot; section, above a squad loadout showing four characters, all of whom have levelling options.

                              <span>Yesterday, news broke that NetEase had been forced to largely disband its team of people working on Activision Blizzard games in China, after negotiations failed to extend the life of hit titles such as World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch in the country. 


Now, Activision Blizzard subsidiary Blizzard China has claimed it offered a six month extension to NetEase, while it spent time looking for a new long-term partner. 


Blizzard China revealed the claim today on social media site Weibo, news agency Reuters has reported. There&#x27;s no detail on Activision Blizzard&#x27;s ongoing search for a new Chinese partner, or word on how or when its games might return.

Prior to The Last of Us&#x27; TV premiere, early word from critics was extremely positive, giving fans of the games plenty to get excited about - and the first episode suggested the hype was well-earned, introducing a stellar cast and expanding on the source material&#x27;s opening hour or so in largely effective, impactful ways.

                              <span>Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, an unannounced new title from Riot Games&#x27; Riot Forge label, has been leaked by the South Korean ratings board.


As spotted by Gematsu, the now-pulled Game Rating and Administration Committee listing described Mageseeker as an &quot;action game for PC&quot; that casts players in the role of League of Legends champion Sylas, who joined the hugely popular MOBA&#x27;s line-up in 2019.


Here&#x27;s how Riot describes Sylas in his official biography: &quot;Raised in one of Demacia&#x27;s lesser quarters, Sylas of Dregbourne has come to symbolise the darker side of the Great City. As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once served...and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day.&quot;

                              <span>Retro spruce-up The House of the Dead: Remake is heading to PlayStation 5 this Friday, 20th January, promising &quot;adjusted&quot; graphics and performance.


Developed by Forever Entertainment and MegaPixel Studio, which previously collaborated on the similar Panzer Dragoon remake, House of the Dead: Remake is an updated version of Sega&#x27;s beloved 1997 arcade rail-shooter, giving the original&#x27;s zombie blasting action a fresh lick of modern-day paint.


Most obvious are the graphical enhancements, but House of the Dead: Remake also features new audio, updated controls (light guns are regrettably not standard on modern consoles), a new Horde mode that increases the on-screen enemy count, a photo mode, gallery, leaderboards, and achievements. There&#x27;s also support for local two-player co-op.

                              <span>With Valheim&#x27;s long-awaited Mistlands biome finally here, developer Iron Gate Studio has opened up a little about what&#x27;s next, sharing initial plans for the acclaimed early access viking survival game next biome, the Ashlands, in its latest blog update.


Taking the same unapologetically literal approach to naming that saw Valheim&#x27;s new mist-shrouded biome become the Mistlands, the Ashlands will whisk players away to a land of ash, where the dead roam a landscape marked by volcanic activity.


While Valheim&#x27;s Ashlands technically already exist in-game - albeit in temporary and extremely rudimentary form - their full development will usher in a radical overhaul, introducing a biome that Iron Gate says will be &quot;quite different&quot; from existing ones, serving up a &quot;large chunk of land at the far south of the map, rather than small islands spread out over the world.&quot;

                              <span>When I was pregnant with my daughter, I did not realise it for a while. My dog, however, knew straight away. He became protective of me, constantly under my feet or curling up across my lap as soon as I sat down. He would not leave my side, and I did not understand why.


Soon enough, it all became clear. I was having a baby. Needless to say, I was surprised. But my dog was not. He knew. He had always known. Animals have a sense for these things. Which is why, when a dog started to become uneasy around a seemingly harmless lady in HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us, I knew straight away something was amiss.

                              <span>Microsoft will next need to defend its $68.7bn bid to buy Activision Blizzard in front of the EU, a fresh report has claimed. 


News agency Reuters reported that Microsoft is set to receive an antitrust warning from the European Commission, setting out the organisation&#x27;s objections to the deal. 


This document will be shared with Microsoft in the coming weeks, it&#x27;s understood, ahead of the EU&#x27;s 11th April deadline for its decision on the deal.

                              <span>Max Verstappen has called this year&#x27;s 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual &#x27;a clown show&#x27; after the high-profile sim racing event once again suffered server issues that saw two red flags that stopped racing and numerous disconnects that took teams out of contention - including reigning F1 world champion Verstappen&#x27;s Team Redline, whose retirement inspired a polemic aimed towards the organisers Motorsport Games and the rFactor 2 platform on which the event was hosted. 


This weekend saw the third running of what&#x27;s widely regarded as the biggest event in sim racing, with the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual attracting stars such as Verstappen and other real-world racers like Romain Grosjean and Felipe Drugovich. It&#x27;s an impeccably presented thing with a team led by experienced motorsport commentators like Martin Haven and Ben Constanduros. 


Unfortunately this year&#x27;s edition was once again plagued by connection issues with the rFactor 2 platform that&#x27;s owned by Motorsport Games unable to host a 24 hour event with stability, with server issues forcing two red flags in the first seven hours of the event. The server issues were later revealed to be caused by participants inadvertently sharing IP addresses with the public.

                              <span>The team of people who worked on Blizzard games in China as part of NetEase has been &quot;dissolved&quot;, a new report claims. 


The news follows the breakdown of Activision Blizzard and NetEase&#x27;s publishing deal which allowed for World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, Diablo 3 and more to be playable in the country.


A report by the South China Morning Post states the team had begun to shed people back in November, when it became clear the companies would not reach an agreement to extend their 14-year partnership. Now, most remaining employees have now been laid off or reassigned.

Skyblivion - a bid to add the world of Oblivion into Skyrim - has now been in development for a decade. Progress has been slow, but steady - with numerous videos released over the years showing work underway.


The latest, which you can see below, is also designed to be a call to arms to other fans who might like to help. With additional support, Skyblivion&#x27;s team hopes that 2025 date can be beaten.

Three unannounced Ubisoft games were canned last week, on top of the four ditched last July. These latest cancellations follow a round of poor financial results and concern over the company&#x27;s future portfolio - something which has also battered Ubisoft&#x27;s stock price. 


Ubisoft&#x27;s statement on the matter admitted it would continue on with &quot;increased cautiousness over the coming years&quot; as the games industry shifts towards &quot;mega-brands and long-lasting titles&quot; - something which raised questions as to where Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 fitted in.

                              <span>It looks like we may get more information about WWE 2K23 at the end of this month, and rumour has it, the latest instalment of the wrestling series will release in March 2023.

It&#x27;s thought we&#x27;ll find out more on 28th January at the upcoming Royal Rumble in San Antonio, with hands-on gameplay and a new mode reveal said to be on the cards.

Insider Gaming says the information set to be shared that night will be embargoed until the end of the month &quot;to allow for travel and content development&quot;, so expect more then. Further information not available at the San Antonio event is rumoured to be coming on 1st February, too.

                              <span>Good news, Simpsons fans - the full soundtrack from The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run is now available on Spotify and Apple Music.

Interestingly enough, it seems as though the soundtracks have been available to stream since September last year, but it&#x27;s only now fans have noticed the cult game&#x27;s OST sitting between other fan-favourite soundtracks, including Go Simpsonic with the Simpsons, Songs in the Key of Springfield, and Testify. 

No-one&#x27;s entirely sure why Disney has made the soundtracks available without a formal announcement, but hey, we&#x27;re not complaining.

The two &quot;exclusive WWE cosmetic bundles&quot; feature the likeness of Undertake and Becky &quot;The Man&quot; Lynch, and are available now on all platforms where you can play Siege, including PC, current-gen consoles, last-gen consoles, and Ubisoft&#x27;s subscription service, Ubisoft+.

The Deadman Bundle for Blackbeard, unsurprisingly given its name, includes the Undertaker uniform, special headgear, an Operator portrait, and a Undertaker Championship charm. You&#x27;ll also get the Moonlight Brawl background and a new skin for the MK17 CQB called The Tombstone.

                              <span>Amazon Games and Smilegate have confirmed that a recent ban wave has &quot;incorrectly&quot; targeted lapsed Lost Ark players.

The issue came to light when thousands of players flocked to Steam to lodge negative user reviews, dropping the &quot;mostly positive&quot; aggregate rating to &quot;mostly negative&quot;. Many state that the message they received said &quot;Ban (inactivity)&quot; with no other reason given for their removal from the game.

In a brief blog post shared over the weekend, the developer said that an error had &quot;triggered these false bans&quot; and vows it will &quot;make this right with affected players&quot;.

The project - which took over three months to complete - uses 17,000 note blocks and 19,000 block commands to bring this evocative rock ballard to life, and even includes an accompanying pixel music and lyric video. Enjoy:

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 may not have released until the end of October, but it&#x27;s now officially the biggest-selling game of 2022 in the US.

Whilst we already knew it was selling by the bucketload, NPD has now released December&#x27;s top selling chart, confirming that Modern Warfare 2 managed to hold on to pole position and finishes the year as the US&#x27; best-selling game.

God of War: Ragnarok released in time to secure a position on 2022&#x27;s Top Ten best-selling games, clocking in at number four behind Madden NFL 23, which took third place. The silver goes to Elden Ring, which held the top spot all year until Modern Warfare 2 came along and kicked it off its perch.

                              <span>Striking Distance Studios&#x27; debut game, The Callisto Protocol, has reportedly failed to hit its sales targets, forcing Krafton&#x27;s investors to &quot;lower their target stock prices&quot;.

That&#x27;s according to a translated article from Korean site MK Odyssey, which says the action horror - which cost 200 billion won (£132m / $161.5m) to make over three years - has affected parent company Krafton&#x27;s value &quot;due to sales shortages&quot;.        

According to Samsung Securities, Krafton expected to shift five million copies of The Callisto Protocol, but with just two million copies sold thus far, the stockbroker now thinks it &quot;will not be easy&quot; to hit that milestone.

                              <span>Google has confirmed plans to release a &quot;self-serve&quot; tool that will make its proprietary Stadia controller function on other platforms via Bluetooth.

This hopefully means that the controller - which is currently locked so it only connects to Google&#x27;s cloud gaming service, Stadia - will still be usable even after Google shutters Stadia later this week.                                                                                                                                                                       

&quot;We&#x27;ve also got Bluetooth news: next week we&#x27;ll be releasing a self-serve tool to enable Bluetooth connections on your Stadia Controller,&quot; the official Stadia Twitter account tweeted last night. &quot;We&#x27;ll share details here on release.&quot;

                              <span>Gun Interactive has revealed more details about its take on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, a new asymmetrical horror game set to release later this year.

A new behind-the-scenes video focuses on the motion-capture process, and we&#x27;re also given a peek at the new single Tragic from Remains, a companion album to the game&#x27;s official soundtrack.                                                                                                                                                                                        

&quot;Shot on location at The House of Moves in Los Angeles, the video diary gives horror fans a fascinating window into the method of mo-cap, illustrating some of the key choreography and physical performance that goes into animating character movements,&quot; Gun explains.

                              <span>Surprise, Stadia players! Google has released Worm Game, a game that &quot;came to Stadia before Stadia came to the world&quot;.

The multiplayer arcade title became available overnight, just days before Google&#x27;s innovative cloud gaming service terminates for good on 18th January, 2023. 

In a bittersweet twist, this means that Worm Game is both the last game to release on the service and the first, as it was used to test features from before Stadia&#x27;s 2019 launch right up until last year.

As spotted by PC Gamer, a poster by the name of Leakerwanderer has uploaded asset repositories of Valve games as they were in 2016, including Portal, CS: Source, Team Fortress 2, Day of Defeat: Source, and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1, 2, and Half-Life 2 multiplayer. 

Despite being &quot;threatened every time&quot; - although by whom and why, we don&#x27;t know - Leakerwanderer took to Discord to say that they now &quot;don&#x27;t care anymore&quot; and uploaded the huge files, which include 61GB of Team Fortress 2 assets alone, including cut and modified content collated over many, many years.

The update ushers in changes to Vikendi, Sanhok, and Taego, as well as an &quot;update to the 1v1 Arena in Training Mode&quot;. You can check out the highlights in the helpful video embedded below:

Vikendi&#x27;s changes include multidrops - which means multiple care packages holding high-tier loot will randomly drop throughout the match - as well as Repair Kits which do exactly what they say on the tin and enable players to repair helmets and armour, plus vehicles, too, if you final the Mechanic&#x27;s Toolbox.

                              <span>With the release of ChatGPT, I’ve read many random articles about this or that threat from the technology.  This paper is a good survey of the field: what the threats are, how we might detect machine-generated text, directions for future research. It’s a solid grounding amongst all of the hype.
Machine Generated Text: A Comprehensive Survey of Threat Models and Detection Methods
Abstract: Advances in natural language generation (NLG) have resulted in machine generated text that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</span>

                              <span>Following this week&#x27;s announcement of yet another delay for Skull and Bones, Ubisoft has shared 30 minutes of new footage from its beleaguered pirate adventure, focusing on what it calls the game&#x27;s &quot;narrative gameplay&quot;.


It&#x27;s perhaps something of an unexpected place to return after a lengthy absence, given Ubisoft insisted Skull and Bones was &quot;not a narrative-driven game&quot; last summer, but it does at least give players a better idea of how the publisher is attempting to inject a bit of variety into the action.


As Ubisoft explained last year, Skull and Bones is overwhelmingly focused on sailing and combat, with players only able to disembark their ships and explore dry land at a limited number of locations, defined as outposts. Functionally, outposts serve as places players can trade, cash in contracts, pay off factions, and meet other players - but, as detailed in Ubisoft&#x27;s latest gameplay devstream, they&#x27;re also locations where they might find narrative content Ubisoft is calling &quot;investigations&quot;.

&quot;We gathered actors from all over the world to voice act the entirety of Final Fantasy 7. Every main, minor, and NPC; you name a character, they&#x27;re voiced - even the tutorials!&quot; reads the Tsunamods website.

Ubisoft has been gradually releasing many of its games on Steam, including Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla back in November. However, players were disappointed at that game&#x27;s lack of Steam Achievements.




The Division 2 arrived on Steam on 12th January, but similarly does not include Steam Achievements resulting in a backlash from fans.

Paizo promises its Open Gaming License (OGL) will be &quot;open, perpetual, and irrevocable&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m a big video game fan, so I played all the games,&quot; Carpenter told Variety. &quot;I was down looking at the new digital cameras, the RED, and happened to mention to them that I would love to do a Dead Space film. That just went around, and everybody said, &#x27;Oh, when are you gonna do it?&#x27;&quot;

                              <span>Dungeons and Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast has reportedly scrubbed the announcement of its new Open Gaming License (OGL), a document which lays out how fans and third-party publishers can make and monetise their own D&amp;D content, following a huge backlash from the game&#x27;s community. 


Last night, upset at expected changes in the updated OGL resulted in a widely-shared push by D&amp;D fans and streamers to ditch the game&#x27;s online subscription, D&amp;D Beyond. 


Gizmodo, which initially published details of the updated OGL last week, subsequently reported that this latest backlash has prompted Wizards of the Coast to cancel its plans to formally announce the changes for the time being, leaving the company&#x27;s upper management in a &quot;scramble to adjust their messaging around the situation&quot;.

                              <span>Google and Nvidia have contacted US financial regulators about Microsoft&#x27;s proposed $69bn takeover of Activision Blizzard, according to Bloomberg (paywall).


Sources told the website both Google and Nvidia had &quot;expressed concerns&quot; to the Federal Trade Commision (FTC), which sued to block the deal in December.


The FTC has argued the buyout, which would grant Microsoft ownership of the likes of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, would reduce competition in the industry - a claim Microsoft has strongly denied. A trial is set for August.

                              <span>Ubisoft will reveal Skull and Bones&#x27; new release date &quot;very soon&quot;, the publisher has said, following yesterday&#x27;s news of a further delay for the beleaguered pirate adventure.


Skull and Bones, which has been in development since 2013, was revealed in 2017 but has faced repeated delays since then, its release most recently being moved from November 2022 to March 2023. Yesterday though, Ubisoft confirmed it was pushing the troubled game&#x27;s launch back yet again, this time to &quot;early&quot; in the fiscal year 2023-24.


In a follow-up statement shared by the official Skull and Bones Twitter account, Ubisoft spoke a little more about the delay, saying its &quot;determination and focus remain the same - offer the best in-game experience possible to our play from day 1&quot;.

                              <span>Justin Roiland - the co-creator of Rick and Morty, and head of High on Life studio Squanch Games - has been charged with domestic violence in relation to a 2020 incident.


That&#x27;s according to NBC News, which obtained a copy of the criminal complaint filed against Roiland through the Orange County Superior Court, charging him with &quot;one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud and/or deceit&quot;.


The complaint relates to an incident which took place on or around 19th January 2020, involving &quot;an anonymous Jane Doe who was dating Roiland at the time.&quot; Roiland is said to have been charged in May 2020 then arrested and released on a $50,000 USD bond in August of the same year. He was then arraigned in October 2020 and pleaded not guilty to both charges.

                              <span>GOG&#x27;s Connect service, which let users grab a free copy of a game they already owned on Steam to add their GOG library, is officially no more.


Launched in 2016, GOG Connect was a neat proposition on paper, allowing users to link their GOG and Steam accounts and then get a duplicate, DRM-free version of a game they&#x27;d already purchased on Valve&#x27;s platform over on GOG.


In practice, though, it was all a bit restrictive, with GOG only offering a very limited selection of eligible games - and even those could only be added to a user&#x27;s GOG library within a very strict timeframe for contractual reasons. Perhaps unsurprisingly, support for the service slowly dwindled and GOG Connect has now been inactive (if not officially dead) for years.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a bit of an irresistable deal for point-and-click adventure fans: you can currently get 13 titles from publisher and developer Wadjet Eye Games&#x27; library of superb point-and-click adventures for just £8, courtesy of Humble Bundle.


Wadjet Eye, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, has been releasing highly acclaimed, old-school-inspired point-and-click adventures - complete with some gorgeous pixel art - since 2006. The studio&#x27;s earliest titles - namely Shivah, which explores themes around the Jewish faith, and the entire Blackwell supernatural detective series - are all present and correct in Humble&#x27;s latest bundle.


And it continues, serving up some real gems as the bundle shifts through sci-fi - in Resonance, TechnoBabylon, and Gemini Rue - to post-apocalyptic nightmare in Shardlight and Promordia to something altogether weirder with Wormwood Studios&#x27; acclaimed Strangeland, in which a man must unravel his past while exploring a terrifyingly surreal carnival.

                              <span>Hello and welcome back to the Eurogamer Newscast! We&#x27;re already almost halfway through January 2023 and the video games industry is stirring. There are huge games on the horizon and plenty to look forward to - and look forward we will. 

2023 promises to be a stellar year for video games, full of proper current-gen console exclusives, awesome indies and more than a few titles held up from last year (and the year before). The next 12 months should see all of these and more splurge out onto the scene for you to try. But where to start? 
Joining me to pick out our highlights for the year are Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan - and there&#x27;s some surprising picks in there, as well as Pikmin 4! Apparently some new Final Fantasy game is coming out too, and Zelda&#x27;s up to something. Beyond video games themselves, there&#x27;s also The Last of Us TV show to look forward to - that&#x27;s out next week! - and hopefully some recommendations from us for some lesser-known gems also waiting in the wings. Thanks for watching!

                              <span>I may be biased, but I really feel that 1989 was a great year (I am biased because it was the year I was born). But, aside from my arrival in the world, it was also a great year because it was the year that the Legend of Zelda cartoon aired. 


Now, I know what you are thinking: &quot;Victoria, why would you care about this? You would have been a newborn when this cartoon was playing on TV and therefore have no idea what was happening. You were probably just learning what your hand was or experiencing mashed potatoes for the first time.&quot;


This is very true. I was. But I&#x27;m also a huge Legend of Zelda fan, and that means as soon as I was aware of the existence of the Zelda cartoon, I tracked it down and watched it for myself. And then, when I had children of my own, I watched it again with them on YouTube. It was a family affair and, as it turns out, having this series become a bit of an ongoing family affair was also a theme during the cartoon&#x27;s conception. How&#x27;s that for a segue?

                              <span>Narrative bicycle adventure game Season: A letter to the future has received a new story trailer ahead of its release on 31st January.
Playable character Estelle narrates her goal - to document the final moments of the world before the season changes and everything is forgotten. The answers to why this is happening seem to lie within a strange valley and its inhabitants.
Some of the key characters players will meet are shown: a young boy named Kochi, a sculptor named Maytora, and a monk called Easel.

                              <span>Destiny 2 developer Bungie has announced a major change for the game&#x27;s selection of armour mods, which - as you might expect - allow you to modify your character&#x27;s abilities.


Beginning now, all &quot;standard&quot; armour mods have been unlocked for all players - a move Bungie says is designed to allow &quot;everyone a chance to enjoy all mods in their current state&quot; ahead of the upcoming Lightfall expansion, which will feature &quot;big changes&quot; to buildcrafting. 


It&#x27;s an interesting move which will allow players far more freedom to experiment with armour mods to find the setup that best suits their playstyle - without relying on the random chances of particular mods turning up for sale via Ada-1&#x27;s in-game shop.

Battle Mode is set to be added alongside a new mechanic called Series Drop, which affects rarity of cards.

In a call with investors, the company said it was facing &quot;major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles&quot;, resulting in the underperformance of recent releases Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023.


Since the announcement, company stocks have fallen by 19 percent to trade at €19.26, the Financial Times reported.

The state&#x27;s growing stake has risen from 5.01 percent last May, when word of its investment first surfaced, to 6.07 percent now. 


At the time, Nintendo said it learned of the investment from news reports and declined to comment further. This latest update comes from Nintendo&#x27;s own report, via Reuters. We&#x27;ve contacted Nintendo for further comment.

Normally, Experian requires that those seeking a copy of their credit report successfully answer several multiple choice questions about their financial history. But until the end of 2022, Experian’s website allowed anyone to bypass these questions and go straight to the consumer’s report.

Kubernetes has been widely adopted, and many organizations use it as their de-facto orchestration engine for running workloads that need to be created and deleted frequently.
Therefore, proper scheduling of the pods is key to ensuring that application pods are up and running within the Kubernetes cluster without any issues. This article delves into the use cases around resource management by leveraging the PriorityClass object to protect mission-critical or high-priority pods from getting evicted and making sure that the application pods are up, running, and serving traffic.

                              <span>MechWarrior 5 developer Piranha Games is working on a new title in the long-running MechWarrior series, with the studio currently aiming to release the project in 2024.


Piranha Games president Russ Bullock shared the news during an interview with the NoGutsNoGalaxy podcast (thanks PC Gamer), teasing, &quot;I&#x27;ll just say that it&#x27;s not MechWarrior Online 2, it&#x27;s not the successor to MechWarrior Online, it&#x27;s not an online PvP [game] - think of it more in line with MechWarrior 5, but a standalone game, a standalone product.&quot;


According to Bullock, the currently mysterious title - which is being developed for PC and consoles - follows &quot;more of a single-player co-op type of pathway&quot;. Beyond that, though, details are thin, and a full reveal may not happen until this autumn.

Company of Heroes 3&#x27;s multiplayer tech test runs until 6pm next Monday, 16th January, and is intended to help Relic test its &quot;servers and infrastructure on a large scale&quot;.


Players will need to request access to the tech test via Company of Heroes 3&#x27;s Steam page, with participants being granted access to eight different multiplayer maps set across Italy and North Africa that can be experienced in 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 matches.

                              <span>Ubisoft has confirmed the cancellation of three unannounced games following disappointing financial results for its most recent quarter, with the publisher&#x27;s troubled pirate adventure Skull and Bones also having received a further delay.


Announcing the news, Ubisoft said it was facing &quot;major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles&quot;, compounded by the underperformance of recent launches including Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023.


Ubisoft says the resulting financial pressures have triggered a full review of its revenue prospects, leading to an &quot;increased cautiousness over the coming years&quot;. As a result it has decided to cancel three unannounced projects, on top of the four games cancelled last July.

Back 4 Blood is, of course, the co-op zombie shooter from Left 4 Dead studio Turtle Rock, which aims to give the genre of a bit of a twist through game-altering deck building. Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition, meanwhile, is Capcom&#x27;s well-regarded most recent chapter in the long-running demonic hack-and-slash series. 


Acclaimed supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange is actually joining the PlayStation Plus catalogue with two instalments - developer Dontnod&#x27;s initial episodic adventure and Deck Nine&#x27;s prequel Before the Storm, which follows the adventures of Chloe Price before she met the first game&#x27;s protagonist Max Caulfield.

                              <span>A new update for Xbox consoles will make them &quot;carbon aware&quot; - reducing the carbon footprint by optimising updates and download times to when the most renewable energy in local energy grids can be used.


The feature will be available for Xbox Insiders using the energy saving shutdown power option and with their console configured to support automatic updates.


From today, Insiders will also have their Xbox Series X/S console automatically update to the shutdown option, which reduces power consumption while the console is switched off.

Except it&#x27;s actually Doom. Huh.


As shared on Twitter by user Sugary Noe (and reported by Nintendo Life), the first section of the game is playable in VR - that&#x27;s Hyrule field and the first dungeon.

                              <span>If you are based in the UK and looking forward to the upcoming TV adaptation of The Last of Us, I have some good news - it will be airing on Sky Atlantic at the same time as it does on HBO in the US. 


This does, admittedly, make for a rather unsociable hour to be up. If you are in Blighty, it will mean watching the show at 2am. 


However, if you are anything like me and a big fan of The Last of Us, this show may well make the eye bags and inevitable reliance on intravenous coffee to get you through the rest of the next day worthwhile.

                              <span>Fortnite has brought back its long-lost plague doctor character set for the first time in three years, following a believed forced absence during the Covid pandemic. 


Scourge and Plague (1500 V-Bucks each) returned to Fortnite&#x27;s infamous rotating item shop at midnight last night, after an absence of 1080 days. Both are styled after the beaked physicians seen in the 16th and 17th centuries who treated bubonic plague victims.


Originally released in late 2018, the skins formed a regular and popular set which went on sale every couple of months - until their last appearance at the end of January 2020. At the time, I remember their spotlight in the item shop raising eyebrows, as the early stages of the Covid pandemic were already dominating global news.

                              <span>YouTubers have reported seeing their work retroactively slapped with unexpected age restrictions, or being demonetised, as a result of the platform&#x27;s recent rule changes regarding profanity usage and violent content in videos uploaded to the site.


These changes, which were first laid out by YouTube in November, state the platform&#x27;s &quot;approach to profanity is changing&quot; (thanks, Kotaku).


Now, all profanities are &quot;treated equally&quot; across the site, meaning words like &#x27;crap&#x27; carry the same weight as &#x27;fuck&#x27; as far as inappropriate language use goes (the site has, however, eased its stance on both &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;damn&quot; - these words are no longer classed as profanities and can be used more freely).

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge first launched last year for PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch. It was warmly-welcomed by fans, thanks to its blend of retro side-scrolling gameplay and its classic Turtles action and visuals.

The phenomenon of using machine learning to teach an AI program how to play Rocket League is nothing new, as this PC Gamer report delves into. Trained bots have been pitted against each other for a while in local matches, and the question of how much and how well an AI program can learn to play a game like Rocket League is an interesting one to answer.


The problem comes with the seemingly more recent discovery by players that versions of the game&#x27;s AI-trained Nexto bot are now being used to cheat in Rocket League&#x27;s competitive ranked play modes, disguised as human players.

In addition, Version 1.2.0 amends the difficulty of some Niflheim stages, makes small gameplay adjustments, and squashes some bugs.


Furthermore, the patch makes it easier to obtain the items necessary to unlock the secret chapter that offers a taste of forthcoming prequel Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.

On a Final Fantasy 14 Mahjong stream with the rest of the development team, Yoshida was asked about rumours of a Final Fantasy 16 PC release.


&quot;I don&#x27;t know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that. In either case, please buy the PS5 [version]!&quot; he said, as per a translation from streamer and translator Aitai Kimochi.

                              <span>We&#x27;re less than a week away from the highly anticipated debut of HBO&#x27;s live-action The Last of Us TV adaptation and early reviews from critics are positively glowing, with the series currently enjoying a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes across more than 40 reviews at the time of writing.


First announced back in 2020, HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us TV adaptation has been written and created by Chernobyl&#x27;s Craig Mazin, alongside Naughty Dog&#x27;s Neil Druckmann. It stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, with other notable cast members including Nick Offerman in the role of Bill, Jeffrey Pierce (who played Joel&#x27;s brother Tommy in the Last of Us video games) as quarantine zone rebel Perry, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge, who reprises her video game role of Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies resistance.


The last few months have seen HBO&#x27;s PR machine crank into top gear as The Last of Us&#x27; January release approaches, with December bringing the show&#x27;s second full-length trailer. Now, though, some lucky professional critics have had the chance to watch the entirety of the show&#x27;s first season, and - despite some notable changes to the source material - the praise is effusive.

                              <span>The UK government has passed a law mandating new homes in England must be built with &quot;lightning-fast&quot; gigabit-capable broadband connections.


Gigabit broadband - that is, broadband capable of download speeds of at least 1 gigabit-per-second - is currently available in over 72% of the UK, according to the government&#x27;s figures. However, a new law, in effect since December, aims to increases that percentage further by making it a legal requirement that new homes are fitted with infrastructure and connections capable of delivering gigabit broadband.


&quot;The updated regulations mean that more people moving into new homes will have a gigabit-capable broadband connection ready when construction is completed,&quot; the government explained, &quot;avoiding the need for costly and disruptive installation work after the home is built and enabling residents to arrange the best possible internet service at the point they move in.&quot;

                              <span>If you&#x27;re at all curious about One Piece Odyssey - the latest limb-stretching video game adventure for Monkey D. Luffy and friends - Namco Bandai has you covered, with a demo now available on Xbox and PlayStation ahead of this Friday&#x27;s release.


One Piece Odyssey unfolds on a mysterious island discovered by the Straw Hats pirate gang after their ship is caught in a storm. The ensuing action takes the form of an RPG, with open-world exploration punctuated by turn-based battles and dungeons - with each of the game&#x27;s playable characters able to use their unique abilities in variety of situations, including battles, traversal, and puzzle solving.


Playable characters include Luffy, Zoro, Sani, Usopp, and Nami, with the likes of Portgas D. Ace and Trafalgar Law putting in an appearance as supporting characters that can fight alongside the core crew. In story terms, that&#x27;s possible thanks to Memoria - a realm made of the Straw Hats&#x27; memories, which they&#x27;ll need to explore to retrieve their lost abilities.

                              <span>Following the commercial (if not critical) success of its Halo TV series, Paramount+ is delving into video-game-adjacent realms anew, this time with a live-action adaptation of the seminal Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy role-playing series.


As reported by Deadline, Paramount+ secured the TV rights to the series following interest from multiple buyers, with the streaming service having now placed an eight-episode order.


Paramount Pictures and eOne are partnering to produce the series (the pair are also co-producing the upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie Honor Among Thieves), which is being described as the studio&#x27;s &quot;largest-scope TV project ever&quot;.

                              <span>Preliminary figures from the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association&#x27;s annual report (hereon referred to as ERA) reveal video games represented 42.1 percent of the UK&#x27;s total home entertainment revenues in 2022. 


The UK trade organisation has estimated games made £4.66bn last year (a rise of 2.3 percent from 2021). This means that, once again, games are the biggest home entertainment industry in the UK (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz). 


Most of this preliminary figure is made up by digital game sales, which according to ERA are estimated to represent around £4.17bn in revenue. This is a rise of 3.1 percent year-on-year.

                              <span>Fortnite has today seen a brief period of downtime, as developer Epic Games rushed out a much-needed maintenance patch to fix a major issue with one of the game&#x27;s most-used items. 


The Shockwave Hammer, introduced last month alongside the game&#x27;s bumper Chapter 4 revamp, was  disabled yesterday in several of Fortnite&#x27;s competitive modes as a glitch which allowed players to repeatedly spam the item became rampant. 


Players have taken to social media over the past week to brand the game as &quot;unplayable&quot; after the glitch&#x27;s use spread - allowing players to jump around the map non-stop, without the item&#x27;s usual cooldown.

GamesIndustry.biz revealed that &quot;roughly 20 people&quot; who contributed their time and effort working on the game did not get mentioned in its end credits. This reportedly included senior developers, leads, directors and &quot;really core people who built the studio up&quot;.


When asked about this snub, one source told the publication it &quot;stings&quot; to not see their work credited.

F1 Manager 2022 was an important launch for Frontier, announced as the first game in a new and lucrative annual franchise for the studio, following the studio&#x27;s previous sales disappointment Jurassic World Evolution 2. 


But while initial &quot;player engagement at release in August 2022&quot; was &quot;broadly in-line with original expectations&quot;, interest in the game soon dropped off and could not be revived despite &quot;key holiday season price promotions&quot;, Frontier admitted in a financial update.

                              <span>Bitmap Books, the UK publisher known for its sumptuously designed line-up of retro gaming books, has announced it&#x27;s cancelling its planned unofficial Mega Drive/Genesis Visual Compendium following threats of legal action from Sega.


Bitmap&#x27;s Mega Drive Visual Compendium would have been the eighth title in the striking Visual Compendium series, following books covering the gaming highlights and history of the Atari 2600/7800, Commodore 64, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, NES, SNES, and Master System.


The latter volume was produced in partnership with Sega, but despite Bitmap Books&#x27; efforts, its planned Mega Drive Visual Compendium didn&#x27;t have the official backing of the company, ultimately leading to its demise.

                              <span>Sam &amp; Max: The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse, the third and regrettably final season of Telltale Games&#x27; episodic point-and-click adventure series, will be getting the remaster treatment in 2023 courtesy of developer Skunkape Games.


The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse, which initially released all the way back in 2010, features yet more anarchic escapades from cult comic book artist Steve Purcell&#x27;s crime-fighting dog and bunny duo Sam &amp; Max, this time pitting the pair against Eldritch gods, alien warlords, and more in a battle to control an ancient, otherworldly power.


Skunkape hasn&#x27;t said much too much about The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse Remastered beyond confirmation it&#x27;ll launch later this year, but it seems reasonable to expect the same kind of attention seen in the developer&#x27;s previous Sam &amp; Max remasters - Save the World and Beyond Time and Space - which featured the likes of enhanced graphics and audio, dynamic lighting, improved lip syncing, a new user interface, controller support, and more.

That&#x27;s according to Windows Central&#x27;s Jez Corden, who claims the showcase - reportedly titled Xbox Developer_Direct - will air on Wednesday, 25th January at 12pm PT/8pm in the UK.


Citing a &quot;variety of sources familiar with Microsoft&#x27;s plans&quot;, Corden says the showcase will focus on content from Xbox and Bethesda, offering an &quot;intimate&quot; look at &quot;major&quot; first-party titles for 2023. These will reportedly include Arkane&#x27;s delayed Redfall, Turn 10 Studios&#x27; latest Forza Motorsport, Mojang&#x27;s action-strategy spin-off Minecraft Legends, and unspecified &quot;content&quot; from content from ZeniMax Online Studios.

                              <span>We&#x27;re mere weeks away from the release of EA Motive&#x27;s extremely promising remake of sci-fi horror classic Dead Space, and to sweeten the deal for those considering a pre-order, EA is bundling in a copy of the original Dead Space 2 on Steam.


EA Motive&#x27;s Dead Space remake - which launches for PC and current-gen consoles on 27th January - is a ground-up reworking of Visceral Games&#x27; much-loved 2008 original, reimagining engineer Isaac Clarke&#x27;s terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura with enhanced audio and visuals, gameplay refinements, and more.


As spotted by VG247, players that pre-order the remake on Steam will now get a nifty bonus in the form of 2011&#x27;s Dead Space 2, meaning they can dive straight into the Isaac&#x27;s continuing story when the credits roll. Despite its age, Dead Space 2 ordinarily costs £17.99 on Steam, so that&#x27;s a decent saving for anyone who&#x27;s yet to experience the well-regarded sequel.

                              <span>Last week, I detailed some of the small deviations HBO&#x27;s adaptation of The Last of Us is making from the game.


However, over the weekend a fairly big change came to light - in HBO&#x27;s take on the series, the Cordyceps infection will not be spread by spores in the air. Rather, it will be able to spread by &quot;tendrils&quot; that can become a &quot;network that is interconnected&quot;.


During an interview with Collider, co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin spoke more about pandemics generally, and how the infection would be depicted in the show.

Each Oreo cookie contained in the brand&#x27;s special Xbox packs will be stamped with a design that features one of several controller buttons - A, B, X and Y, plus a directional arrow. 


The idea here is that these button combinations can be arranged, cheat code style, into codes which you can redeem on the Xbox Oreo website for the cosmetics in question.

The hit mobile game finally launched the long-awaited Kecleon, its  final creature to come from Ruby and Sapphire&#x27;s Hoenn region, in a surprise move over the weekend. The game originally debuted its first Gen 3 creature all the way back in 2017.


Kecleon is a chameleon Pokémon which can turn itself near-invisible. Its long, unexplained absence from Pokémon Go had prompted memes from fans waiting to complete their Gen 3 &#x27;dex that Kecleon had always been in the game, just impossible to see. Well, see it you now can.

While the charity organisation says it &quot;is sad to part ways with Uyama&quot;, it adds that it &quot;remains dedicated to the community he helped grow while living up to the legacy of camaraderie and altruism he leaves behind&quot;.
Uyama stopped short of revealing his next steps but did say he had plans to &quot;take a break [...] before diving headfirst into [his] next adventure&quot;.

Earlier today, according to SteamDB, Steam set another all-time concurrent users of 33,078,963, but whilst the majority of those were logged in but idling, today Steam has also clocked up 10,284,568 active users.

The games keeping us busy this weekend? As is usually the case, the top two are CS:GO and Dota 2, but Among Us clone Goose Goose Duck jumps in to take the bronze. PUBG, Apex Legends, Lost Ark, GTA 5, Rust, Modern Warfare 2, and Wallpaper Engine round out the top ten respectively.

                              <span>Dragami Games - the team behind the upcoming remake of cult classic Lollipop Chainsaw - has given us our first sneaky peek of leading lady, Juliet Starling.

Last year, the remake&#x27;s producer said that upcoming remake of cult classic Lollipop Chainsaw will not make broad changes to the story or design of the original game, and that includes any potential changes to the look of its main character, cheerleader Juliet.

Courtesy of a celebratory New Year&#x27;s tweet, it looks like the team has been true to its word. Although it&#x27;s only the tiniest glimpse, we&#x27;ve finally got our first look at the new-look Juliet, who&#x27;s still slashing through hordes of zombies rocking a skimpy outfit, which you can see below:

Attractions Magazine was invited to get an early peek at the new theme park, which is set to include Bowser&#x27;s Castle amongst other Mario-flavoured attractions. You can check it out for yourself in the video below:

This is the second Mushroom Kingdom theme park area to open globally, following the first&#x27;s opening at Universal Studios in Japan in 2021. The two will share a number of similar attractions, including an AR Mario Kart-themed ride, a Mario-themed cafe, and exclusive merchandise.

A 3-site map like Haven, Lotus is &quot;inspired by traditional Indian stepwells, rock-cut architecture and Dravidian style structures&quot; and offers new environmental features such as  &quot;rotating doors and destructible walls&quot;. You can check it out in the teaser video below:

&quot;We wanted to make another 3 site map and show that this is more of a format we’ll keep using than just a single map. Additionally, we aimed to make a map with high flexibility and movement for both teams,&quot; said level designer, Joe Lansford.

                              <span>If you can&#x27;t wait to lay your hands on the upcoming Fire Emblem sequel, Engage, I have good news: the tactical RPG&#x27;s opening cinematic and title screen is now available online.

The brief video also gives us a peek at the game&#x27;s new anime-esque visuals. But enough talk - you can check it out for yourself in the teaser below:

&quot;Honestly, I love it. It falls somewhere between &#x27;this is so dumb I love it&#x27; and &#x27;this is exactly what my inner child needs after the passing of both Kevin Conroy (Batman from DCAU) and Jason David Frank (Green and White Ranger in Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers)&#x27;,&quot; said one happy commenter on the game&#x27;s subreddit page.

                              <span>An early - and playable - prototype for Left 4 Dead has reportedly leaked online.

Described by the mod developer as &quot;a historical dev map seen for the first time outside of Valve&#x27;s office&quot;, the &quot;Zombie City&quot; mod for Counter-Strike: Source by WolfCl0ck was quietly uploaded to Gamebanana on Friday as part of a larger leak of Counter-Strike maps.

&quot;Zombie_City is a map created by Valve (or possibly Turtle Rock Studios) that was a part of the map sources folder that released today,&quot; the mod description page teases (thanks, GamesRadar+). &quot;It is likely the starting point of Left 4 Dead, and for those of you who have heard the name &#x27;Terror-Strike&#x27; before, you will love to get the chance to play this prototype level.

The &quot;R-Code exploit&quot; not only enables hackers to crash their systems and forfeit matches, but it also sees unscrupulous users take control of direct messages and create untenable memory leaks (thanks, Vice). 

&quot;Whoever is using this r-code exploit can now use this vulnerability to cause the GGST client to have some sort of leak, slowing the game to an unplayable crawl,&quot; tweeted hotashis.

Boen - who can be heard in the Monkey Island series right up until 2010 - was reportedly diagnosed with stage four lung cancer towards the end of last year. 

Boen has been sharing his voice with our favourite video games since 1995, having also starred in World of Warcraft, Psychonauts, Call of Duty, Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance and Sons of Liberty. MobyGames lists 2016&#x27;s World of Warcraft: Legion as his final video game voice credit.

Developer Supertrick Games says it&#x27;s temporarily suspending the free-to-play game due to ongoing &quot;challenges&quot;, saying that since launch, the game has been plagued with issues concerning &quot;in-game matchmaking and lag&quot;. It plans to &quot;redevelop&quot; the game whilst it is offline. 

The service will go dark at 3am UK time on 18th July 2023, and no relaunch date has yet been confirmed. The team does, however, confirm that season 2&#x27;s new content will release as planned, whilst season 3 will &quot;only be partially released&quot;.

                              <span>CCP Games has unveiled its 12-month development plan for Eve Online.

&quot;Commemorating the MMO&#x27;s landmark 20th anniversary throughout 2023&quot;, CCP has plans to release two new expansions, launch Microsoft Excel integration in May for Omega subscribers, as well as usher in the Lunar New Year event, which goes live on 19th January.
