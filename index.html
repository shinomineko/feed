                    <span>Black Myth: Wukong just got a new 12-minute gameplay video and the game continues to look great.
Black Myth: Wukong, the Chinese-made action game based on Journey to the West that took the internet by storm back in August 2020, has now moved over to Unreal Engine 5, Hangzhou-based developer Game Science Studio confirmed.
In fact, the video is recorded real-time in Unreal Engine 5 and &quot;supported&quot; by Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS technology. Black Myth: Wukong is the first Unreal Engine 5 game to feature DLSS, Nvidia said.

                    <span>A new video investigation from People Make Games has accused Roblox Corporation of &quot;exploiting&quot; young game developers.
The video, below, from People Make Games&#x27; Quintin Smith, reveals Roblox&#x27;s shady exchange system, which, it claims, makes it incredibly hard for developers to make money from the platform.
The video also runs through how Roblox, which has 200 million monthly users, encourages young game developers to work incredibly hard with unreasonable expectations of success.

                    <span>The publisher of Aeon Must Die has addressed the game&#x27;s return as its former developers insist their dispute remains unresolved.
Aeon Must Die hit the headlines last year after starring in a much-watched Sony PlayStation State of Play broadcast.
The trailer for the game shown during the August 2020 State of Play, below, depicts a visually arresting beat-&#x27;em-up that caught the attention of PlayStation fans.

                    <span>In a series first, the upcoming Halo Infinite has bots. And not just any bots - as I reported, Halo Infinite&#x27;s bots aren&#x27;t messing about.
Developer 343 used the recent Halo Infinite technical preview to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance. To that end, the technical preview debuted with the Bot Arena playlist, which put four players against four bots on arena maps.
As 343 pushed the bot difficulty lever over the course of the technical preview weekend, the AI became more deadly. These bots were accurate, aggressive and ruthless. They would come in for a well-timed melee hit after dropping your shield. They would dodge grenades. They used grenades well and often. They picked up power weapons and they were not afraid to use them.

                    <span>Switch-owning fans of demon murder (who somehow still haven&#x27;t played id Software&#x27;s legendary Doom saga) are in luck; as part of this year&#x27;s QuakeCon, id has announced a five-game Doom Slayers Collection for Nintendo&#x27;s console, which is available to purchase now.
The reveal isn&#x27;t too much of a surprise - US retailer Best Buy successfully managed to leak the Doom Slayers Collection for Switch earlier today ahead of its official reveal - but the game&#x27;s immediate post-announcement launch most certainly was, and Switch players can now enjoy some demon-hued FPS japes all in one bundle, featuring seminal 1993 original Doom, Doom 2, Doom 64, Doom 3, and 2016&#x27;s sort-of-rebooted Doom.
Notably, that&#x27;s one more game than was featured in the Doom Slayers Collection for Xbox and PlayStation, which released toward the end of last year minus Doom 64 - a pleasant treat for Switch owners, based on Digital Foundry&#x27;s previous enthusiasm for the port.

Announced during QuakeCon&#x27;s Skyrim panel, the Anniversary Edition arrives on 11th November - exactly ten years after the launch of the original version - and bundles together 2016&#x27;s Skyrim Special Edition and a healthy chunk of additional content.
Specifically, it&#x27;ll feature over 500 Creation Club elements - Creation Club being Bethesda&#x27;s curated pool of officially sanctioned mods, which would usually need to be purchased with credits - including quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and spells.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re looking for a couple more video game freebies to shove unceremoniously into your almost certainly already overstuffed &#x27;to do&#x27; pile, Epic has you covered, with Yooka-Laylee and Void Bastards currently free on its PC store.
Yooka-Laylee, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, is a spiritual successor to Rare&#x27;s beloved platformer Banjo-Kazooie - and was developed by Playtonic, a studio founded by a number of ex-Rare veterans. Lizard and bat replace bear and bird in Yooka-Laylee, but the formula will be immediately familiar to Banjo-Kazooie fans, setting players loose across a number of sprawling, predominantly platforming-focussed worlds as they embark on an perky, old-school collectathon in search of missing Quills.
All in all, it&#x27;s a decently entertaining adventure (although its superb side-scrolling sequel, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, is far superior), and one that Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a &quot;sumptuous, diverting homage to a bygone era in game design that should keep fans of the old school hooked, even if it doesn&#x27;t set the world on fire.&quot;

Announced during Quakecon&#x27;s opening livestream session (which saw id&#x27;s Marty Stratton and Kevin Cloud, alongside Machine Games&#x27; Jerk Gustafsson, reflecting on Quake 25th anniversary), the newly enhanced version of Quake includes visual improvements, online and local split-screen multiplayer, plus a wealth of additional content.
Purchasers will receive the original Quake, its two official expansions - The Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity - plus two expansions created by Wolfenstein: The New Order developer Machine Games: Dimensions of the Past and the all-new Dimension of the Machine. Additionally, mods are supported on PC, while console player will be able to enjoy a selection of curated mods (as was the case for id&#x27;s updated versions of Doom on consoles) at a later date.

                    <span>Ghost of Tsushima has been given a proper PlayStation 5 upgrade, increasing resolution, decreasing loading times and removing pre-rendered cinematics for full real-time alternatives. It&#x27;s a decent - though not exactly game-changing - upgrade, but what did catch our eye beyond this is how the new PS5 version imports any existing PlayStation 4 game saves you may have on your system. It&#x27;s not a completely seamless experience, but the fact is that cross-save now works, allowing you to easily pick up on PS5 where you left off on PS4. 
The technical explanation for PlayStation 5&#x27;s cross-save issues is fairly straightforward. Up until recently, the PS5 system software has no visibility or access to any PlayStation 4 data on your console, meaning that highly convoluted means were required to move progress from one generation to the next. Essentially, the PS4 version of the game had to be patched to allow game saves to be uploaded to the cloud. Moving over to PS5, the cloud data would then be downloaded and progress could continue. Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered are two good examples of this workaround in action. However, more recent titles including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and now Ghost of Tsushima have allowed for native import of PS4 games.
We had a look at Sony&#x27;s SDK roadmap a while back and the concept of allowing PlayStation 5 titles to access PlayStation 4 user data was promised for a future update, which now appears to have rolled out. The first time I loaded Ghost of Tsushima, I disconnected my PS5 from the internet to rule out any potential cloud transfers, accessed the PS4 save game transfer option and discovered that all of my PS4 saves were available - the same saves I generated when I looked at the PS5 60fps patch for the game back in January. In turn, those saves were transferred across from my PS4 Pro using USB storage.

The myth of the treasure fox pops up online every now and then, with players debating whether it&#x27;s true or false.

                    <span>There&#x27;s not long left until the arrival of Life is Strange: True Colours, and ahead of its 10th September release, publisher Square Enix has shared 13 minutes of new gameplay footage, from what appears to be very early in the adventure.
True Colours sees the Life is Strange series heading off to another picturesque corner of the United States - this time to a small Colorado town, Haven Springs, in the shadow of the Rockies - for a brand-new adventure featuring a predominantly new cast of characters.
Here, the focus is on new protagonist Alex Chen who, unusually for the series, has lived with her powers - enabling her to hear the thoughts of other characters, as well as view and experience their emotions - for some time prior to the start of the adventure.

                    <span>Ignition Entertainment&#x27;s cult classic action-adventure El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron finally has a PC release date and will be making its way to Steam on 2nd September.
El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron - which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, having originally launched for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011 - is perhaps the first and only game to be inspired by the apocryphal Book of Enoch.
It recounts the story of Enoch (re-imagined as blond, denim-clad pretty boy) as he hunts downs seven fallen angels at the behest of God - a quest that blends 3D and side-on platform segments with some deceptively simple, and thrillingly balletic, three-weapon combat.

                    <span>Oddworld: Soulstorm, the most recent entry in developer Oddworld Inhabitants&#x27; long-running adventure saga, is currently in the works for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.
Soulstorm - the direct sequel to 2014&#x27;s Oddworld: New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty and a re-imagining of second series entry, 1998&#x27;s Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Exoddus - initially released for PlayStation and PC back in April to somewhat mixed reviews.
Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan, for instance, lamented the action-platformer&#x27;s &quot;unwelcome - and distinctly un-Oddworldly - scrappiness&quot;, which frequently manifested in a litany of unfortunate progress-thwarting bugs. &quot;A shame, really, because once I got through that,&quot; he continued, &quot;I was often swept along with the invention and vehemence and ugly beauty of what&#x27;s on offer in an Oddworld game. At their best these games really do things no other games do.&quot;

The Yakuza protagonist is a playable character, free and unlockable through normal gameplay on all platforms at launch, Sega said. Trailer is below:
The news comes hot on the heels of confirmation Sonic and Tails are playable in Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania. Like, Kazuma Kiryu, Sonic and Tails are free and unlockable via normal gameplay. Selecting them also switches the game&#x27;s bananas to rings, with the Sonic series&#x27; classic sound effects included.

                    <span>EA has vowed to consider &quot;the player perspective&quot; when delisting games in the future.
In June, GOG announced it planned to delist classic quartet Ultima Underworld 1+2, Syndicate Plus and Syndicate Wars from its digital store at the &quot;publisher&#x27;s request&quot; (Electronic Arts).
Then, early August, all four games returned to GOG, where they were made free to download until 3rd September.

                    <span>Some of the people behind indie hit Among Us have spoken out about Fortnite&#x27;s new Impostors mode.
Yesterday, Fortnite developer Epic announced a new game mode for its all-encompassing battle royale that has an uncanny resemblance to 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game Among Us.
Fortnite Impostors sees 10 players, eight agents and two impostors play out their roles on a submarine. Like in Among Us, the agents carry out routine assignments, while the impostors sabotage the facility and eliminate players. Impostors can also teleport players to cover their tracks and disable assignments.

                    <span>Hot on the heels of the news Outriders may not have broken even despite sales of up to 3m units, comes confirmation Biomutant broke even a week after launch with sales of 1m.
Biomutant, developed by Swedish studio Experiment 101, launched 25th May, and has sold more than 1m copies, parent company Embracer Group said in a financial report issued this morning.
&quot;The full investment into development and marketing as well as the acquisition cost for Experiment 101 and the IP, was recouped within a week after launch,&quot; Embracer said.

                    <span>Apple’s NeuralHash algorithm — the one it’s using for client-side scanning on the iPhone — has been reverse-engineered.
Turns out it was already in iOS 14.3, and someone noticed:
Early tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations.

We also have the first collision: two images that hash to the same value.

                    <span>Making games, we are often reminded, is hard, with development frequently being derailed by the most preposterously unpredictable things. Behold, for instance, the newly revealed story of Skyrim&#x27;s iconic cart ride, and how it was, for a time before release, routinely thwarted by a particularly stubborn bee.
The full tale was recently recounted on Twitter by 14-year Bethesda veteran - and now solo indie developer - Nate Purkeypile, who served as senior world and lighting artist during the creation of Skyrim. &quot;That intro is famous now,&quot; Purkeypile wrote, &quot;but back then, it was just that one thing that we had to keep working and working on forever.&quot;
According to Purkeypile, the cart ride was particularly prone to mishaps during development because its bumps and bounces toward Helgen were physically simulated (&quot;Why you ask?,&quot; he adds, &quot;Good question.&quot;) - meaning environmental objects carelessly strewn about the place had a tendency to make the vehicle behave unpredictably, sometimes causing it to fly off the road. As the developer puts it, &quot;The cart had a path it wanted to follow, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it was a path it COULD follow.&quot;

                    <span>Developer Cyan Worlds&#x27; previously Oculus Quest-exclusive remake of seminal CD-ROM puzzle adventure Myst is coming to PC, Mac, and Xbox on 26th August.
This &quot;definitive, modern edition&quot; of Myst (not to be confused with the game&#x27;s first fully 3D remake, realMyst, released back in the year 2000) debuted on the Oculus Store last December, significantly sprucing up the iconic islands first introduced to players back in 1993.
New art and sound are the most obvious improvements to the original game - alongside a photo mode to easily record clues and a randomised puzzle option for those seeking a greater challenge - but this latest version of Myst is also &quot;built from the ground up&quot; for VR.

                    <span>CD Projekt is readying to release Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s &quot;biggest patch to date&quot; - the third major update since the RPG&#x27;s disastrous launch last December - and has now shared full details of what it will bring, including an improved minimap and the game&#x27;s first selection of free DLC.
Prior to Cyberpunk&#x27;s launch, CD Projekt whipped up player interest with the promise of free post-launch DLC. However, plans for additional content were put on hold while the developer worked to fix the game&#x27;s litany of bugs and to bring Cyberpunk&#x27;s widely lambasted last-gen console release up to a more acceptable standard. Now though, according to senior quest designer Patrick Mills on tonight&#x27;s 1.3 update dev stream, &quot;streaming and memory management&quot; have reached a point &quot;where we can start trying to deliver those things&quot;.
As such, 1.3 includes the first of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s free DLC, mostly falling into the category of &#x27;minor cosmetic additions&#x27;. There are two new jackets - a red and shiny number, plus a grey and yellow option with a fur collar - alongside the Quartz Bandit: an orange and black car with its innards on the outside. The jackets and car are two separate rewards unlocked by completing small objectives received on reaching certain points in the game (anyone beyond those point will get the DLC on loading a save), and CD Projekt says future DLC drops will follow the same pattern of integration, with the goal being to make the world feel a little richer.

                    <span>Epic has added a new game mode into Fortnite that has an uncanny resemblance to Among Us. 
Fortnite Imposters sees 10 players, eight agents and two imposters play out their roles on a submarine. Like in Among Us, the agents carry out routine assignments, while the imposters sabotage the facility and eliminate players. Imposters can also teleport players to cover their tracks and disable assignments. 
Of course, it wouldn&#x27;t be Fortnite without a few memes. For a short period‌, a &quot;Peely Party&quot; takes place where all agents and imposters look like Peely, an iconic character of judicial significance.

                    <span>Rocket League on PlayStation 5 gets a 120hz mode tomorrow, 18th August, developer Psyonix announced in a post on the PlayStation Blog.
A new &quot;Video Quality&quot; setting within the Video Settings menu lets players select Quality or Performance modes.
Quality mode enables 4K resolution at 60fps with HDR. HDR requires an HDR10-compatible display and HDMI 2.0 cable or better, and you&#x27;ll need a 4K capable display to experience 4K. If you use a 1080p display in this mode, Rocket League renders at 1080p supersampled from 4K.

Alpha skip-ahead Insiders on an Xbox Series X connected to a 4K display can now begin testing an increased resolution user interface, Microsoft said.
This change means Home, Guide and other areas of the UI are displayed in a higher native resolution for increased sharpness and text readability.

                    <span>A writer on Rainbow Six Siege has expressed their pride at the game&#x27;s first transgender operator, who arrives with the Crystal Guard season update.
Narrative writer, Simon Ducharme, said they are &quot;incredibly proud&quot; of developing the character and had &quot;tears of joy&quot; knowing they were &quot;encouraged and supported&quot; to write queer characters.
Speaking to Gamespot, Ducharme added: &quot;The decision to create a transgender character was made early on, as part of our initiative to have an inclusive roster of Operators. The consultants, all of whom are trans people, wanted to make sure that Osa was presented as authentically and organically as possible. She was written by a queer person and she is voiced by a trans woman - and while her identity is certainly influenced by her gender, who she is in the Siege universe is centered on her talents, her influence on Nighthaven, and her close friendship to Kali.&quot;

                    <span>The developer of Outriders has said Square Enix has yet to pay it a royalty fee, suggesting it has yet to break even.
In a financial statement, Polish company People Can Fly said that up to 16th August, it had not received royalties on the sale of the co-op-focused looter-shooter from publisher Square Enix.
Royalties would be paid to PCF if the net receipts from the sales of Outriders yielded the pre-agreed level of returns for Square Enix on the costs incurred relating to quality assurance, distribution and marketing. Essentially, the contract states PCF gets its royalties on profits only after Square Enix makes back its investment.

                    <span>Riot misled staff about their right to speak out about harassment and discrimination, according to the State of California.
Riot has denied the claims.
The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing - the same agency suing Activision Blizzard over what it alleges to be a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot; - said League of Legends maker Riot failed to tell its staff of their right to speak to the government about harassment and discrimination. The DFEH filed its own lawsuit against Riot in February.

                    <span>Naughty Dog once worked on a Last of Us Part 2 multiplayer mode, a datamine suggests.
YouTuber Specilizer found multiplayer assets in the game that point to a large multiplayer map, which they speculate could be for a Factions battle royale mode given the size of the map. Considering the development period and release date of the game saw the explosive rise of battle royale games like Fortnite and PUBG, it makes sense Sony would have wanted to explore the genre with a first-party title.
Other assets include a &quot;Listen-Mode-Device&quot;, which could potentially be the way to use listen mode in multiplayer. There are also backpack and armour models specifically for multiplayer.

According to an investigation by Kotaku, staff at Ubisoft Singapore, which is home to around 500 staff and is current working on the troubled Skull &amp; Bones, allegedly suffered from sexual harassment, racial pay disparities and bullying by managers, as well as &quot;bad projects&quot; and &quot;toxic leaders&quot;.
Now, in a report by The Straits Times, an English-language daily broadsheet newspaper based in Singapore, the national watchdog for fair employment practices has launched an investigation into Ubisoft Singapore over the claims.

                    <span>Authors: Brandon Smith (Microsoft)
Kubernetes v1.22 introduced a new alpha feature for clusters that
include Windows nodes: HostProcess containers.
HostProcess containers aim to extend the Windows container model to enable a wider
range of Kubernetes cluster management scenarios. HostProcess containers run
directly on the host and maintain behavior and access similar to that of a regular
process. With HostProcess containers, users can package and distribute management
operations and functionalities that require host access while retaining versioning
and deployment methods provided by containers. This allows Windows containers to
be used for a variety of device plugin, storage, and networking management scenarios
in Kubernetes. With this comes the enablement of host network mode—allowing

                    <span>Two years after its arrival in Dead by Daylight, Stranger Things is returning to the Upside Down, with all DLC inspired by Netflix&#x27;s hit show being removed from sale this November. But as Dead by Daylight starts its long goodbye to one franchise, it&#x27;s preparing to say hello to another, with all signs pointing to the imminent arrival of Hellraiser in-game.
First introduced in September 2019, Dead by Daylight&#x27;s Stranger Things collaboration ushered in two new survivors - Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler - alongside new killer The Demogorgon, and the Underground Complex Map.
For reasons unspecified (although almost certainly licensing-related), The Demogorgon, Nancy, and Steve - plus each characters&#x27; respective outfit cosmetics - will no longer be available for purchase in Dead by Daylight&#x27;s store from 17th November.

                    <span>BloodRayne Betrayal is getting remastered and will be heading to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC - complete with full voice acting and other additions - on 9th September.
Developed by Shantae studio WayForward and released in 2011, Betrayal marked a notable shift for the BloodRayne series, ditching the third-person action of previous instalments in order to send half-vampire protagonist Rayne on a side-scrolling hack-and-slash adventure through 15 monster-battering stages of spooky old castle.
For Betrayal&#x27;s imminent remaster - officially known as BloodRayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites - WayForward and publisher Ziggurat Interactive are promising a range of improvements, including the addition of full voice acting to enliven the text-only original.

                    <span>John Romero still isn&#x27;t done with Doom; the legendary designer has confirmed he&#x27;s currently working on a follow-up to his &quot;unofficial&quot; Doom episode, Sigil.
Announced to coincide with Doom&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2018 and released as a free megawad the following year, Sigil was designed as the unofficial fifth episode in the original Doom saga - picking up after Ultimate Doom&#x27;s Thy Flesh Consumed - and treated fans to 18 brand-new, Romero-designed levels: nine single-player and nine death match.
Two years on from its release, Sigil was looking increasingly like a one-off experiment for Romero, but now - in a new video interview with Bridgeburner, lead developer on Doom total conversion The Age of Hell (skip to the 42-minute mark) - the designer has confirmed he&#x27;s currently working on a sequel, this time utilising Doom 2.

Baiken goes on sale on 18th August, according to the video below, as part of Samurai Shodown&#x27;s third season of DLC characters.
Baiken is a neat fit for weapon-based fighting game Samurai Shodown. In the world of Guilty Gear, Baiken is a wandering samurai out for revenge on That Man. She isn&#x27;t a playable character in the recently-released Guilty Gear Strive, although she appears briefly in the story mode.

                    <span>Bloodborne has a first-person mod that goes beyond simply moving the camera.
Modder Garden of Eyes worked with modder Zullie the Witch, who created the Dark Souls 3 first-person mod, to create Bloodborne&#x27;s first-person mod. Trailer is below:
As you&#x27;d expect, Bloodborne&#x27;s combat looks and feels entirely different in first-person, where you don&#x27;t have as comprehensive a view of the action afforded by a third-person perspective. The bosses in particular look extra scary up close!

                    <span>Capcom has released a Street Fighter 5 update and, surprising fans, has tweaked Sakura&#x27;s face.
Sakura&#x27;s face as it appears on the Street Fighter 5 character select screen has been a point of contention ever since she was added to the fighting game in January 2018, with some criticising her &quot;bug eyes&quot; and &quot;alien&quot; look.
The update changes Sakura&#x27;s character select stance, and so we see her face from a slightly different angle and with different lighting. This makes all the difference, and her face on character select now doesn&#x27;t have that bug-like alien look.

                    <span>Marvel&#x27;s Avengers players already know that Black Panther is set to arrive later this week, but developer Crystal Dynamic has also now revealed other characters coming to the MMO, too, including Ulysses Klaue and &quot;iconic&quot; villain, Crossbones.
&quot;I think what&#x27;s really fun about the sheer amount of Marvel villains on our roster is we get to really dig into what would be the most interesting twist and turn from what we&#x27;ve done previously,&quot; writer Hannah MacLeod told GameInformer (thanks, TheGamer).
&quot;Crossbones has some of the most iconic comic dialogue ever because he just enjoys himself so much, but he&#x27;s also got some interesting tricks up his sleeve. There&#x27;s always a lot of discussion of who we think our villains should be. Klaue doesn&#x27;t really get his hands dirty in the same way as other villains might, so we needed him to have a character who would have no problem with that.&quot;

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve noticed that you haven&#x27;t been able to pull off any assassinations in the Halo Infinite tech test, there&#x27;s a reason for that - they&#x27;ve been removed. 
Halo Infinite developer, 343 Industries, confirmed assassinations will not be available in the sci-fi shooter during a livestream back at the end of July. However, the recent test flight has seen interest in the notably absent franchise tradition resurface online.
Assassinations - animations that are triggered when you creep up on an enemy player and melee them from behind - have long been a Halo staple. But despite the team at 343i &quot;really lov[ing] assassinations&quot;, they&#x27;ve been removed because of the &quot;gameplay disadvantage&quot; to pulling one off.

                    <span>Valve has awarded a security researcher $7500 for reporting a bug that permitted players to falsify credits to their Steam wallet.
As spotted by The Daily Swig, researcher &quot;drbrix&quot; reported the exploit via HackerOne, stating they had &quot;found [a] vulnerability which allows attacker to generate steam wallet balance&quot;. The bug - which has since been resolved - would permit players with &quot;amount100&quot; in their Steam account email address to intercept payments made via Smart2Pay and artificially inflate them (thanks, NME).
After detailing how the exploit could be generated, Valve&#x27;s JonP promptly thanked drbrix and agreed the team at Valve had been able to &quot;validate this is happening pretty much as described&quot;, and were taking steps to address it.

                    <span>Spider-Man is still coming to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers and should be with us by the end of the year.
As Matt told us at the time, Spider-Man was revealed to be coming to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers - controversially as a PlayStation-only addition - last August, with Crystal Dynamics announcing an &quot;early 2021&quot; release date for the character. 
However, questions began to arise earlier this year when the studio revealed a new Marvel&#x27;s Avengers development roadmap in which Spidey was notably absent, and ended in Crystal Dynamics formally confirming a delay.

                    <span>It looks like that rumoured Alan Wake sequel has moved into &quot;full production&quot;. 
While the highly-anticipated sequel has yet to be formally confirmed by developer Remedy, it&#x27;s long been rumoured that the two-project publishing deal Remedy struck with Epic Games will both be set within the same franchise, and many speculate they&#x27;re connected to horror Alan Wake. 
Now, courtesy of the company&#x27;s latest investor report, the studio has provided an update on both projects.

                    <span>Boyfriend Dungeon developer Kitfox has agreed to update its content warning following feedback from players.
Though the current statement warns that users should &quot;play with care&quot; given the game &quot;may include references to unwanted advances, stalking, and other forms of emotional manipulation&quot;, the mature themes have prompted Kitfox to update the warning and make it &quot;more accurate&quot; in an update next week.
&quot;The content warning for Boyfriend Dungeon inadequately describes the events of stalking and emotional manipulation that exist in the story,&quot; the developer said in a statement on Twitter (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;We&#x27;ll update the game next week with a more accurate CW. We apologise for any hurt inflicted by our mistake. Thank you for playing!&quot;

It&#x27;s from Nightdive Studios, the developer behind the recent releases of Doom 64 and Shadow Man and the upcoming System Shock remake. The trailer is below:
PowerSlave first released in 1996 on the Sega Saturn, and for the time had a unique mix of traps, puzzle-solving and first-person platforming. It acted as a precursor to the likes of Nintendo&#x27;s Metroid Prime.

Storman must file a declaration, under penalty of perjury, with the California federal court &quot;certifying his compliance with these terms&quot; by 20th August.

                    <span>The Half-Life 2 community came together today to set the game&#x27;s highest concurrent player count since records began.
In mid-July, Valve game YouTubers joined up to issue players the &quot;Breaking the Bar&quot; challenge: beat Half-Life 2&#x27;s concurrents record by playing the game at 4pm today, 14th August.
The community wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what Half-Life 2&#x27;s concurrent peak was prior to today. According to Steam Charts, whose data goes back to July 2012, it was 6882, set back in March 2020 and sparked by the release of Half-Life: Alyx.

                    <span>This week, Kotaku reported Rockstar is working on remastered versions of Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, using Unreal Engine to create a mix of &quot;new and old graphics&quot;.
The news helps explain Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s recent GTA mod takedown spree - particular mods that recreated the games in question.
But it also helps explain why Rockstar nuked a San Andreas fan remake trailer in July 2020, too.

                    <span>EA has issued a start warning to those playing the Battlefield 2042 technical playtest this weekend: break NDA and face a potential ban from the final game.
Battlefield 2042&#x27;s closed playtest kicked off on Thursday with PC, and has now brought Xbox into the fold (the planned PlayStation test was cancelled at the last minute due to a &quot;critical issue&quot;). Predictably, gameplay footage leaked online, which EA yesterday scrambled to pull offline.
An NDA (non-disclosure agreement) is typically required from video game publishers for tests such as this, and aims to prevent the sharing of information, impressions or assets from the playable build.

                    <span>Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls, the canned mobile-exclusive instalment of Konami&#x27;s legendary platform series, is being resurrected for Apple Arcade.
Grimoire of Souls was initially announced back in 2018, promising a portable slice of gothic action-platforming focussed on the adventures of Genya Arikado - a &quot;persona of Alucard - as he attempted to stop the impending resurrection of Dracula.
That quest took him to worlds inside magical grimoires for familiar bouts of side-scrolling action, playable both solo and co-operatively, and across a variety of different modes - with the game featuring a number of other playable characters, including Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Charlotte Aulin, and, Glyph Master Shanoa.

                    <span>Namco Funscape in London has closed down after 25 years.
The arcade centre inside London&#x27;s County Hall off Westminster Bridge shut its doors at 6.30pm last night, 12th August.
&quot;We&#x27;re heartbroken to have closed our landmark site that has been entertaining families, friends, and corporate groups from all over the world for 25 years,&quot; reads a post on the venue&#x27;s Facebook page.

                    <span>As the Battlefield 2042 technical preview goes ahead, EA is scrambling to take down leaked gameplay footage all over the internet.
Last week, Battlefield fans were invited to sign up to test a technical preview of the game, which they were not allowed to discuss even receiving.  
Of course, despite EA&#x27;s perhaps unrealistic wishes, word of the preview inevitably leaked, foreshadowing what was to come.

                    <span>Publisher No More Robots has announced Not Tonight 2, the sequel to 2018&#x27;s unapologetically political post-Brexit document-checking game.
Developer PanicBarn&#x27;s Not Tonight 2 travels across the pond to an &quot;alternative&quot; USA, where capitalism and political greed have taken center stage. It&#x27;s described as &quot;basically America: The Video Game&quot;, with three branching stories written by a team of POC authors and artists.

                    <span>The problem with spear phishing it that it takes time and creativity to create individualized enticing phishing emails. Researchers are using GPT-3 to attempt to solve that problem:
The researchers used OpenAI’s GPT-3 platform in conjunction with other AI-as-a-service products focused on personality analysis to generate phishing emails tailored to their colleagues’ backgrounds and traits. Machine learning focused on personality analysis aims to be predict a person’s proclivities and mentality based on behavioral inputs. By running the outputs through multiple services, the researchers were able to develop a pipeline that groomed and refined the emails before sending them out. They say that the results sounded “weirdly human” and that the platforms automatically supplied surprising specifics, like mentioning a Singaporean law when instructed to generate content for people living in Singapore...</span>

                    <span>Rockstar is reportedly putting the finishing touches to remasters of its open-world PlayStation 2-era classics Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas for release later this year.
Rumours of possible remasters for the games first bubbled up over the summer as fans began wondering why Take-Two&#x27;s lawyers had suddenly started issuing a raft of takedown notices for classic GTA mods. Speculation grew further following Take-Two&#x27;s recent confirmation it had three unannounced &quot;new iterations of previously released titles&quot; in the works.
Now, however, an investigation by Kotaku has revealed more tangible details, with its sources - who, the website says, have a proven track record providing accurate information on GTA Online and Red Dead Online - claiming Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are indeed getting the remaster treatment.

                    <span>Cory Davis, creative director and designer on Spec Ops: The Line, and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck have joined forces to establish a new game studio, Eyes Out.
Based in Los Angeles, Eyes Out is said to consist of a team of &quot;passionate world-builders and storytellers who believe in the powerful synesthesia that emerges from music, narrative, and interactive experiences&quot;. Work on the studio&#x27;s first project is currently underway, and while specifics are limited, it&#x27;s described as a &quot;single-player immersive cosmic horror game with strong environmental storytelling elements.&quot;
The project won&#x27;t be Davis&#x27; first tangle with the horror genre; while cult favourite 2012 shooter Spec Ops: The Line is perhaps his most discussed work, Davis&#x27; packed resume also features level design credits on the horror-heavy Condemned 2: Bloodshot and F.E.A.R: Extraction Point, and he served as director on 2016&#x27;s surreal PSVR horror title Here They Lie.

                    <span>Lone Echo 2, the sequel to developer Ready at Dawn&#x27;s acclaimed 2017 zero-gravity VR adventure, will miss its previously announced 24th August release date, and is now expected to launch on Oculus devices some time &quot;later this year&quot;.
Lone Echo 2 catapults protagonists Captain Olivia Rhodes and player-controlled android Echo One (nicknamed &quot;Jack&quot;) 400 years into the future, where an abandoned space station holds the key to returning home. Pre-release glimpses suggest it&#x27;ll deliver another bout of moody sci-fi adventure built around zero-gravity traversal and puzzling, with Ready at Dawn promising &quot;complex challenges&quot; and &quot;startling discoveries&quot; as its &quot;emotional&quot; far-future story unfolds.
Lone Echo 2 was originally announced all the way back in 2018 for a release the following year, but the game has see multiple delays along the way - the most recent due to development challenges involving the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. And now Ready at Dawn has confirmed it&#x27;ll be pushing launch back once more in a post to its blog.

                    <span>It looks like there&#x27;s more death, misery and ice on the horizon - as a sequel to Frostpunk has been announced by 11 Bit Studios. 
Frostpunk 2 is the first of three current in-house projects to be formally revealed by 11-Bit Studios, and given the success of the first game, perhaps this one doesn&#x27;t come as much of a surprise. A brief announcement trailer has been released, showing that the world of Frostpunk has moved on from coal to oil - although it looks just as brutal as before.  
&quot;In Frostpunk&#x27;s successor, players are once again tasked with playing as the leader of a resource-hungry metropolis where the expansion and search for new sources of power is an unavoidable reality. But the apocalyptic world has moved on,&quot; says the press release. &quot;After the age of coal, conquering Frostland for the oil extraction industry is expected to be the new salvation of what&#x27;s left of humanity. However, change does not come easily, and not everyone in this new multi-layered society will welcome this new direction.&quot;

                    <span>EA and DICE have released a short film that gives us a short look at the world of Battlefield 2042. 
&quot;Exodus&quot; introduces the No-Pats, a multinational armed militia that is engaged in a civil war over the future of the group. The film also confirms that the other main factions of the game will be the United States and Russia. 
Both states are on the brink of war as the world struggles over resources and surrounding nations have collapsed, while the group of nomads from collapsed nations known as the Non-Patriated (&quot;No-Pats&quot;) appear to have bound together for survival.

                    <span>Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan was forced to suspend several rides yesterday after a stack of Goomba characters plummeted to the ground. 
No injuries have been reported.
The Goomba statue broke free from its normal position atop the Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure ride, Asahi Shumbun Digital reported (thanks, VGC). The Goombas fell just next to the ride&#x27;s track, close to where a Yoshi car was passing by, but not directly onto anywhere guests could have been.

The somewhat inevitable crossover includes a series of in-game quests for a free emote voiced by Reynolds himself (or in your local language in non-English speaking countries), as well as a frankly horrifying skin.
This skin is Reynolds&#x27; other character in the film, the muscled &quot;Dude&quot;. It&#x27;ll be available in Fortnite&#x27;s item shop tonight upon its usual reset time. Here it is, along with that emote:

                    <span>Doctor Who&#x27;s brand-new mobile (and PC) game is out now on consoles. 
Doctor Who: The Lonely Assassins builds on the events of iconic Doctor Who episode Blink, transporting players into a series of sinister events occurring at Wester Drumlins - the very same abandoned London townhouse where the Weeping Angels made their first TV appearance.
It stars ex-UNIT scientist Petronella Osgood (played by Ingrid Oliver), who is investigating the events of the legendary Blink episode, and the subsequent disappearance of Larry (Finlay Robertson returns to play as Larry).

The game is set to launch on Xbox and PlayStation&#x27;s last-gen and current-gen consoles, and now its developer has said its &quot;vision&quot; is to bring Splitgate to Switch. 
In a developer Q&amp;A earlier this week (thanks, GameSpot), developer 1047 Games said it plans to expand its platform support.

                    <span>Back in January, we got a pretty extensive look at the remastered environments and quests being made for Skyblivion - a mod project seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine. The team behind this ambitious project has continued making progress, and the latest mod development video focuses on some of the stunning landscapes that are now nearing completion. 
According to the new video, the majority of Skyblivion&#x27;s map is now in the final stages of development, and the work shown so far is seriously impressive. The video discusses how areas such as the forest surrounding the Orange Road have been adapted and improved for the remake. The team decided to make the forest &quot;more lush and detailed than its original counterpart&quot; and make it larger to give it a more prominent role in the game, citing the area&#x27;s ambience and popularity with players as the reason for giving it more attention. 
Blackwood, meanwhile, has been given more fortifications and border gates to add points of interest. The new boggy marsh at the centre of Blackwood, called Blackmarch, looks suitably horrifying and spooky - promising players a subregion full of ruins and decay. The city of Leyawiin has been redesigned from the ground up &quot;referencing concept art from Oblivion that was likely discarded owing to technical and time limitations&quot;, with the city divided into three distinct sections. Boats are now able to sail right through the city, allowing them to go further inland.

The blog post explains some of the internals of the Memory manager, a beta feature
of Kubernetes 1.22. In Kubernetes, the Memory Manager is a
kubelet subcomponent.
The memory manage provides guaranteed memory (and hugepages)
allocation for pods in the Guaranteed QoS class.
This blog post covers:
Why do you need it?
The internal details of how the MemoryManager works
Current limitations of the MemoryManager
Future work for the MemoryManager
Why do you need it?
Some Kubernetes workloads run on nodes with
non-uniform memory access (NUMA).
Suppose you have NUMA nodes in your cluster. In that case, you&#x27;ll know about the potential for extra latency when
compute resources need to access memory on the different NUMA locality.

                    <span>Boyfriend Dungeon, the long-awaited weapon-romancing dungeon-crawler from developer Kitfox Games, is finally here on PC, Xbox, Switch, and Game Pass.
If Boyfriend Dungeon seems like a name that&#x27;s been knocking around for a while, you&#x27;d be right; it was initially announced back in 2017, and successfully raised $272,000 in Kickstarter crowdfunding a year later. Since then, Kitfox has been hard at work on its genre-mash-up oddity - lovingly referred to as a &quot;shack-and-slash&quot; - that&#x27;s part dungeon-crawler  (complete with procedurally generated maps and varied combat styles) and part dating sim.
&quot;You move into your cousin&#x27;s old apartment, rent-free for the summer,&quot; Kitfox explains in a bout of scene-setting. &quot;To get some confidence and meet people, plus earn a little cash, you&#x27;re tasked with clearing the creatures in &#x27;the dunj&#x27;. Soon you discover weapons [that] transform into cuties... and they&#x27;re SINGLE!... But someone&#x27;s abducting weapons and leaving them damaged in the dungeon! Who could do such a thing? Will you solve the blade-napping mystery? Will you find love? Or, friendship, at least?&quot;.

                    <span>American Truck Simulator players eager to hit the road in search of new horizons can now get a 20-minute taste of the superb sim&#x27;s upcoming Wyoming expansion in a new gameplay video.
Wyoming will be the eighth world-expanding DLC to release for American Truck Simulator since its launch back in 2016 (following on from Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, and last year&#x27;s Colorado), bringing its state count up to a total of ten once the base game&#x27;s California and Nebraska are factored in - meaning SCS Software will officially be one fifth of the way through its recreation the US on Wyoming&#x27;s arrival.
&quot;Wyoming may be one of the least populated states in the US,&quot; SCS explained previously, &quot;but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it lacks spectacular places to visit and see. Home to some of the country&#x27;s most breathtaking national parks, Wyoming is best known for its red-walled gorges, hot springs, historic prairie towns, pioneer history, and historical attractions.&quot;

                    <span>It was a busy old Indie World showcase this evening, with Nintendo serving up another brisk - but extremely eventful - look at some of the new titles heading to Switch between right now and into next year. Headliners included surprise launches for Axiom Verge 2 and Boyfriend Dungeon, not to mention an upcoming release for the superb Tetris Effect: Connected, but if you missed the show and want a convenient catch-up, you&#x27;ll find everything announced below.
Necrobarista: Final Pour, an enhanced version of the acclaimed visual-novel-style adventure from Route 59, is launching as a timed console exclusive on Switch today. Once again, the stylishly told story focusses on a magical Melbourne cafe where the dead are granted one last night to mingle with the living, but Final Pour introduces new narrative content, remastered visuals, plus a new Studios mode, where players can create their own dialogue and stories.
Necrobarista isn&#x27;t the only game launching on Switch, however; head to the eShop right now and you&#x27;ll find Axiom Verge 2, the long-awaited follow-up to developer Thomas Happ&#x27;s acclaimed 2015 retro-styled Metroid-a-like, as well as vibrant life-sim-style adventure Garden Story - a timed console exclusive on Switch that charts a sentient grape&#x27;s attempts to fend of the omnipresent Rot and help rejuvenate an island and its inhabitants.

                    <span>Tetris Effect: Connected, the muliplayer version of developer Enhance&#x27;s gorgeously hypnotic reimagining of the classic block-dropping puzzler, is making its way to Switch on 8th October.
The original Tetris Effect, created by legendary game designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi (known for the likes of Rez, Lumines, and Space Channel 5), was, of course, very good indeed, transforming the classic puzzler into a mesmerising audio-visual treat. We even called it our Game of the Year when it released in 2018 (and one of our Games of the Decade in 2019.
Last year&#x27;s Tetris Effect: Connected update expanded on the superb single-player original with a range of new online and local multiplayer modes (both co-op and competitive), and it&#x27;s this version - also featuring cross-platform online support - that&#x27;ll be released on Switch in October.

                    <span>Chucklefish&#x27;s gorgeous 2D pixel art adventurer will launch as a timed console exclusive for Nintendo Switch on 16th September. 
Nintendo revealed the date this afternoon, as part of its just-finished Switch indie game showcase. 
We&#x27;ve had our eyes on Eastward for some time, through various demos (here, Chris Tapsell writes about being enraptured by it, all the way back at EGX 2019).

                    <span>Nintendo announced the surprise news in this afternoon&#x27;s Switch indie showcase.
To say we&#x27;ve been waiting a while for this sequel would be an understatement. Axiom Verge 2 was already four years in the making when it was announced in 2019, back then for launch in 2020.

                    <span>Niantic, developer of Pokémon Go, has laid out its long-term plan for a &quot;real-world&quot; metaverse based on our global reality - rather than an entirely virtual one of the kind seen in Ready Player One.
In an extended blog post titled &quot;The Metaverse is a Dystopian Nightmare, Let&#x27;s Build a Better Reality&quot;, company founder John Hanke has discussed his vision for how technology can be harnessed to build a better version of our world which strengthens in-person interactions - while criticising the idea of technology designed to abandon our reality and instead play inside a computer simulation.
This is all long-term future stuff, so there&#x27;s no direct reference to Pokémon Go&#x27;s ongoing big debate around pandemic interaction distance changes. (It also arrives alongside news of another Niantic company acquisition - this time of fancy 3D scanning app Scaniverse.) But there are certainly comments here which reinforce Niantic&#x27;s long-term ethos for its games - and Pokémon Go in particular - which touch on issues raised in that debate, and perhaps further illuminate Niantic&#x27;s own position in it.

                    <span>Teabagging is a 20-year-old Halo tradition, the ultimate insult on the virtual battlefield - but don&#x27;t expect Halo Infinite&#x27;s otherwise lifelike bots to get stuck in.
Anyone who&#x27;s played a Halo game online will probably have been teabagged. For the uninitiated, it involves repeatedly pressing the crouch button so your Spartan character squats up and down on your enemy&#x27;s corpse.
Halo players have been teabagging each other since Halo: Combat Evolved came out in 2001, to rub it in, to frustrate and annoy. In the online world of Halo, teabagging is very much human behaviour.

                    <span>In a fresh update to Red Dead Online, Rockstar Games has added a new game mode called Call to Arms.
The mode tasks players to protect various locations from up to 10 waves of incoming enemies. Players will have to position themselves around the map to defend all the areas. 
The locations are Blackwater, Fort Mercer, Valentine, Strawberry, and MacFarlane&#x27;s Ranch.

                    <span>More Journey to the Savage Planet is in the offing, with its original developer Typhoon Studios reforming as Raccoon Logic.
Typhoon closed its doors earlier this year when Google shut down its internal Stadia studios just 14 months after the streaming tech&#x27;s high-profile launch.
Raccoon Logic is the new Montreal-based studio that is, essentially, the Google-acquired Typhoon Studios reborn. It has secured a &quot;large&quot; initial investment from Chinese megacorp Tencent, and regained the intellectual property rights for Journey to the Savage Planet.

Specifically, this is the eye-catching Renaissance clobber Ezio wore back in Brotherhood - his fan favourite look. 
You can acquire the free costume by logging into your Ubisoft Connect account on console or PC - but there&#x27;s a twist. For now, Ezio&#x27;s clothes are only available if Ubisoft detects you have played two previous games in the series.

As reported by Axios, SOC Investment Group&#x27;s executive director Dieter Waizeneggar issued a letter to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s lead independant director Robert J. Morgado, criticising the steps the company has said it is taking to address the ongoing culture crisis.
Last week, Activision Blizzard executives such as boss Bobby Kotick insisted &quot;we will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry&quot;.

                    <span>The recently-released The Ascent is a gorgeous, incredibly-detailed cyberpunk action role-playing game that plays from a fixed, top-down, isometric perspective. But what happens when you unlock the camera?
In the video below spotted by Kotaku, Gaming with Griff Griffin shows us that Neon Giant&#x27;s The Ascent looks just as good in first-person, with an impressive level of detail on display when you&#x27;re viewing the world up close. We see detailed character models, environments and even objects in shops (The Ascent&#x27;s shops are great!). I love the Neuromancer nod, too.
Griff Griffin used a tool called the Universal Unreal Engine 4 Unlocker to move the camera about (details are in the video description). It&#x27;s a great thing, too because we see The Ascent&#x27;s compelling cyberpunk world holds up under close scrutiny. That developer Neon Giant is a studio of just 12 people makes this all the more impressive.

Developer DeNA also announced that Hop and Zamazenta plus Sygna Suit Leon and  Eternatus will debut in the game from today. 
Dynamaxing was introduced to the Pokémon series in Sword and Shield. This game mechanic allows a Pokémon to grow in size, turning their attacks into powerful Max Moves.

                    <span>Cobolt Strike is a security tool, used by penetration testers to simulate network attackers. But it’s also used by attackers — from criminals to governments — to automate their own attacks. Researchers have found a vulnerability in the product.
The main components of the security tool are the Cobalt Strike client — also known as a Beacon — and the Cobalt Strike team server, which sends commands to infected computers and receives the data they exfiltrate. An attacker starts by spinning up a machine running Team Server that has been configured to use specific “malleability” customizations, such as how often the client is to report to the server or specific data to periodically send...</span>

                    <span>Set photos snapped by fans earlier this year seemed to confirm it, but now it&#x27;s official: Knuckles will be joining Sonic the Hedgehog in Paramount Pictures&#x27; upcoming live-action movie sequel, and he&#x27;ll be played by none other than Idris Elba.
Knuckles&#x27; inclusion in the second Sonic movie seemed almost certain after fans spotted a stand-in prop of the echidna (alongside similar ones for Sonic and Tails) on-set back in April, and we&#x27;ve now been given a first official tease of the character&#x27;s movie look on Twitter.
The image - a close-up of Knuckles&#x27; knuckles, naturally - was shared by Idris Elba on social media following confirmation that the actor (most recently seen in James Gunn&#x27;s The Suicide Squad) would be voicing the character in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, which is scheduled to arrive in cinemas on 8th April 2022 if all goes well.

                    <span>As part of its decidedly leisurely ID@Xbox indie showcase this evening, Microsoft confirmed another batch of titles heading to Game Pass between now and some currently unspecified future point, including Stardew Valley and nefarious management sequel Evil Genius 2.
Stardew Valley developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone popped up midway through tonight&#x27;s showcase for a bit of a natter, confirming toward the end of the segment that his much-loved village life sim would be heading to Game Pass for PC and Xbox some time this autumn.
Also still awaiting a Game Pass arrival date is the adorable Pupperazzi, a first-person photography game that - as you may have already surmised from its title - tasks players with taking cute snaps of (and petting!) canines as they go about their doggy lives in a colourful holiday paradise. As with most of the below, details on specific Game Pass platforms weren&#x27;t shared during the show, but I&#x27;ll update the story if any clarification is forthcoming.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been eyeing up Player Unknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds (or PUBG: Battlegrounds as its new marvellously redundant moniker would have it) for the last four years but somehow still haven&#x27;t quite convinced yourself to pick give it a go, you might be interested to know you can currently play the one-time battle royale phenomenon for free on PC.
PUBG: Battlegrounds&#x27; Free Play Week is now underway on Steam, giving interested parties to chance to play all available modes and maps until next Monday, 16th August. That, of course, includes PUBG&#x27;s new Taego map, whisking players players back to 1980s South Korea. 
Taego - PUBG&#x27;s first 8x8km map since 2017&#x27;s Miramar - is notable for a number of key new features, including self-revive and the new Gulag-esque Comeback BR mechanic. The latter gives players that die prior to the first Blue Zone the chance to respawn if they can survive against other players in a separate Comeback Arena.

                    <span>Team Fortress 2, it&#x27;s fair to say, is getting on a bit. The 14-year-old game remains incredibly popular on Steam, but over the past year it&#x27;s hit the headlines for the wrong reasons, with bot problems that show no sign of disappearing. (Although we got to witness players conga-ing their way past the bots, at least.) 
In any case, it seems the community has finally taken it upon themselves to give Team Fortress 2 a refresh, as a group of modders called Amper Software has started recreating the game in Garry&#x27;s Mod spiritual successor s&amp;box. The reason for this: they wondered what Team Fortress 2 would look like in Valve&#x27;s newest engine, Source 2. 
&quot;Ever since Source 2 was first mentioned publicly as an engine that Valve was working on, a lot of people in the Team Fortress 2 community have started asking the question: if Valve ever ports TF2 to Source 2, what would it look like? How different gameplay would be? And would TF2 even feel the same?,&quot; the team explained in a blog post. &quot;...s&amp;box, the spiritual successor of Garry&#x27;s Mod made on the Source 2 engine, has been released as part of a dev preview to a group of community members, including ourselves. It, pretty much, like Garry&#x27;s Mod itself, allows you to build whatever you want using the toolset that it provides. So we&#x27;ve decided to not lose that chance.&quot;

                    <span>EA Sports has reduced the weekly match requirements for FIFA 22 Ultimate Team&#x27;s Division Rivals mode, and leaned more heavily on the seasons model.
Division Rivals - the most popular mode in Ultimate Team - pits players against each other in ranked matches.
With FIFA 21, EA implemented a cap on the number of games that contribute to the Weekly Score accumulation in Division Rivals. After completing your first 30 games of FIFA 21&#x27;s Rivals, the matches stop adding to your Weekly Score.

                    <span>FIFA 22 will for the first time in the series let you turn off opponent celebrations.
Celebrations have been a long-standing conduit for toxic behaviour in competitive FIFA. Your opponent is forced to watch them - and they can be pretty grating after rage-inducing goals are scored.
With FIFA 21, EA pulled the Shush and A-OK celebrations from the game. The Shush celebration in particular was infamous within the community as it was done while the scoring player was running. (Players sometimes use running celebrations to extend the celebration time as they jog up and down the pitch - a frustrating time-wasting tactic.)

                    <span>Ever since Nintendo Switch emulation became viable on PC a few years ago, modders have been tinkering away, improving many visual aspects of Switch games.
Now, German modder Digital Dreams (thanks, Kotaku) has released a showcase of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild running at 8K resolution with ray-tracing, and it looks absolutely stunning.
Using post-processing injector Reshade, Digital Dreams was able to create a ray-tracing preset for the game and manipulate the colour hue to give it an added sparkle. Depth of field has also been retouched and greater draw distances have been added.

                    <span>The 20-minute broadcast will include details on various upcoming Nintendo Switch indie games. You&#x27;ll be able to watch on YouTube or right here, via the stream below.
There&#x27;s no word on which games may feature - though even if it&#x27;s just a couple of the titles we recently saw in the indie-focused Annapurna Interactive showcase then we&#x27;ll be happy.

Sega has licensed Hive to make this new entry and release it in the first half of 2022 in Japan, North America and Europe.

                    <span>Iron Gate has served up a few more morsels of information about upcoming Valheim update Hearth and Home, and this time, it&#x27;s all about changes to the game&#x27;s food system. The way snacking works is being given an overhaul - and it looks like some food items are getting a nerf in the process. Ah crumbs. 
In the game&#x27;s current form, simply shoving some food in your mouth will result in (somewhat) even amounts of health and stamina, but the system arriving in Hearth and Home will change that. Food will soon be divided into three categories: items that provide more health, items that provide more stamina, and items that provide an even split. As explained in the video below, that means you can bulk up on meat and HP before a big battle - or slurp down a stew to increase your stamina for an afternoon of building. 
The different categories will be marked by a coloured fork icon, with red indicating a focus on health, yellow for stamina, and white for a balanced meal. The food bar is also being replaced by a timer system to indicate how long the foods will last.

                    <span>Take-Two Interactive is attempting to shut down Ozark, a popular mod menu for Grand Theft Auto Online. 
As you would expect from a mod menu, Ozark lets modders manipulate the game, both in the campaign and online, to their liking, allowing them to teleport, instakill, spawn vehicles, drop money, and more. 
While modding single player games has some legal ambiguity (Take-Two also seems determined to make all forms of modding illegal), modding multiplayer sessions is detrimental to the experience of other players.

                    <span>Sony&#x27;s acquisition of anime-streaming service Crunchyroll is now complete, with the final price set at $1.175bn.
We first heard word of Sony&#x27;s intent to gobble up Crunchyroll late last year, when it bid $957m. 
Today, Sony announced it had finally secured the service, its 5 million paying subscribers and more than 120 million registered users.

                    <span>A few years after the mini console boom comes the turn of another classic system - the Amiga.
Similar to the C64 Mini - which Retro Games Ltd also produced - this is a reimagining of the 16-bit Commodore personal computer, touting emulation of the original A500 chipset and the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) of later Amiga model the A1200.
The A500 Mini comes with both a mouse and gamepad, as well as support for a plugging in a standard keyboard over USB, since we imagine the keys on the mini system itself are too dinky to use.

That&#x27;s according to details revealed by Sony on PlayStation Germany&#x27;s official blog.
Despite years of using Duolingo, my German isn&#x27;t so great, so here&#x27;s the rather hilarious direct translation from Google Translate: &quot;You have never seen the criminal metropolis Los Santos so beautiful when the skyline shines thanks to a bold graphic update in crisp 4K resolution and you make the city extremely smooth and unsafe thanks to a smooth 60 FPS.&quot;

                    <span>Nintendo has been typically tight-lipped about the plot of the movie, which marks Mario&#x27;s big-screen return after an understandably long hiatus. 
But, speaking of long absences, how about this? Maniscalco revealed he would voice Spike, Mario&#x27;s boss - a character likely based on Foreman Spike from NES game Wrecking Crew in 1985.

                    <span>Apple’s announcement that it’s going to start scanning photos for child abuse material is a big deal. I have been following the details, and discussing it in several different email lists. I don’t have time right now to delve into the details, but wanted to post something.
EFF writes:
There are two main features that the company is planning to install in every Apple device. One is a scanning feature that will scan all photos as they get uploaded into iCloud Photos to see if they match a photo in the database of known child sexual abuse material (CSAM) maintained by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC). The other feature scans all iMessage images sent or received by child accounts — that is, accounts designated as owned by a minor — for sexually explicit material, and if the child is young enough, notifies the parent when these images are sent or received. This feature can be turned on or off by parents...</span>

The stable version of CSI Proxy for Windows has been released alongside Kubernetes 1.22.  CSI Proxy enables CSI Drivers running on Windows nodes to perform privileged storage operations.
Background
Container Storage Interface (CSI) for Kubernetes went GA in the Kubernetes 1.13 release. CSI has become the standard for exposing block and file storage to containerized workloads on Container Orchestration systems (COs) like Kubernetes. It enables third-party storage providers to write and deploy plugins without the need to alter the core Kubernetes codebase. Legacy in-tree drivers are deprecated and new storage features are introduced in CSI, therefore it is important to get CSI Drivers to work on Windows.
A CSI Driver…</span>

                    <span>Author: Elana Hashman (Red Hat)
The 1.22 release introduced alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for
Kubernetes workloads on a per-node basis.
In prior releases, Kubernetes did not support the use of swap memory on Linux,
as it is difficult to provide guarantees and account for pod memory utilization
when swap is involved. As part of Kubernetes&#x27; earlier design, swap support was
considered out of scope, and a kubelet would by default fail to start if swap
was detected on a node.
However, there are a number of use cases
that would benefit from Kubernetes nodes supporting swap, including improved
node stability, better support for applications with high memory overhead but
smaller working sets, the use of memory-constrained devices, and memory
flexibility.
Hence, over the past two …</span>

                    <span>Psyonix&#x27;s four-wheeled footie game Rocket League kicks off its fourth season this Wednesday, 11th August, and the developer has outlined its key new additions - including the striking Deadeye Canyon arena - ahead of release.
There&#x27;s admittedly not a whole lot to report on the new arena yet - although you can get a long-distance glimpse below - but there&#x27;re a few more details to share ahead of Season 4. Come Wednesday&#x27;s launch, for instance, Rocket League players will be able to enjoy expanded competitive tournaments including Extra and 2v2, with the latter appearing in the first of Season 4&#x27;s limited-time modes: 2v2 Heatseeker.
This gets underway on 12th August and will be followed by Speed Demon - a &quot;super-fast LTM [combining] mutators, the speed of Boomer Ball without the wild bounces, demos on contact, and a fast respawn timer&quot; - and then Spring Loaded due later this month.

                    <span>Forza Horizon 5, the latest instalment in Playground Games&#x27; sublime open-world racing series is a few short months away from release, and with the hype handle now beginning to crank in earnest, the developer has offered a first look at the game&#x27;s sprawling Mexico-themed map.
You can see the map, with its tantalising tangle of roadways and landmarks below, but Playground has also given a bit of a guided tour in its latest video (start at the 27-minute mark).
As creative director Mike Brown reiterates, Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s map will be 50% bigger than that of its UK-set predecessor, providing ample room for its previously announced 11 biomes, which include tropical and rocky coastlines, living and sandy deserts, winding canyons, arid hills, lush farmland, river-strewn jungles, swampland, and the vibrant city streets of Guanajuato - all beneath the gargantuan volcano that lies at the centre of the map.

                    <span>Following its launch on PC and Switch last year, I Am Dead, the acclaimed afterlife puzzler from developers Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg (who&#x27;ve previously worked on the likes of Hohokum and Wilmot&#x27;s Warehouse) is now available for Xbox and PlayStation.
I Am Dead, which is published by Annapurna Interactive, casts players as recently deceased museum curator Morris Lupton, who, with a little help from his equally non-corporeal dog Sparky, must save his tiny island home of Shelmerston from volcanic destruction.
It&#x27;s a thoroughly endearing adventure that plays out a little like a supernatural find-the-object game as players investigate the islanders&#x27; memories and use Morris&#x27; ghostly vision to twirl, slice, and probe the beautiful diorama-style innards of objects around him.

Overcooked, which tasks players with working together to frantically assemble meals and fulfil customer orders within a time limit (while also trying to navigate the peculiarities of some wildly impractical kitchens at the same time), initially launched on 3rd August 2016 - and has been causing heated arguments with loved-ones ever since.
On the game&#x27;s actual fifth birthday last Monday, Ghost Town announced it would be releasing some free anniversary treats for owners of Overcooked: All You Can Eat (the recently released remaster bundle of Overcooked 1, 2, and its DLC) and the update has now arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

&quot;It&#x27;s not only that you have to solve the technical challenge of merging existing accounts, but there are also legal and contractual issues to navigate with purchasing on other platforms,&quot; he explained. &quot;Different regions have different laws.

Back in July, Codemasters released a patch that temporarily disabled ray-tracing to aid the game&#x27;s stability. Since patch 1.05, this has been fixed and ray-tracing has been reinstated. 
But now with its latest patch, 1.06, another PS5-specific feature has been removed: 3D Audio.

                    <span>This year&#x27;s controversial and disrupted Olympic Games have now concluded - and as the BBC finishes its coverage, the broadcaster has given viewers a tour behind the scenes of its virtual studio. 
Fortnite gets a namecheck in the explainer video below, hosted by the BBC&#x27;s Dan Walker and Sam Quek, as it&#x27;s revealed how everything except the presenters&#x27; chairs and table was a creation of Unreal Engine. 
Unreal Engine is commonly used in film and TV production either to create virtual studios or surroundings, or to mock up in real-time how an effects-based shot might look with live-action actors in frame.

                    <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky is celebrating five (extremely eventful) years since launch today, and developer Hello Games has served up a tiny tease for the exploratory space sim&#x27;s next big update, Frontiers, as part of the festivities.
While No Man&#x27;s Sky soothing exploratory rhythm certainly found its fans at launch on 9th August 2016, its arrival was infamously marked by immediate and sustained controversy when players discovered some of the features discussed prior to its release were absent from the final game. Hello Games has embarked on a truly staggering post-launch development journey since then, and has now put out a total of 16 named - and in some cases utterly transformative - updates for the ever-expanding space sim.
We&#x27;ve seen the introduction of base building, bobbleheads, farming, cross-platform multiplayer, VR support, giant customisable space freighters, land and water vehicles, pilotable mechs, living ships, alien-infested space derelicts, new flora and fauna, pets, live-service-style community expeditions, music tools, major overhauls to the game&#x27;s planetary generation tech, spicy visual enhancements for new-gen consoles, sand worms (finally!), and more.

                    <span>The developer of Back 4 Blood, Turtle Rock Studios, has confirmed the game will not have a campaign versus mode. 
In an FAQ thread in the studio&#x27;s official Discord server, it stated: &quot;We do not have plans to have a campaign versus mode at this time&quot;.  
Back 4 Blood does have a versus mode, allowing two teams to take it in turns to fight each other as the Cleaners and the Ridden. But there is no campaign level akin to Left 4 Dead, where players would have to fight through player-controlled zombies to get to the safe house.

                    <span>A video for Gearbox&#x27;s cancelled Duke Nukem Begins provides us with an idea of what the game might have been.
In 2008, with Duke Nukem Forever in development hell, artist Gregor Punchatz headed up a Gearbox-commissioned project at Dallas, Texas-based production studio Janimation to create an animated vertical slice to show what Duke Nukem Begins was meant to be.
The video shows third-person shooting, with Duke killing various demons using familiar weapons in an urban setting. We also see four-player co-op. There&#x27;s a big boss fight at the end, with Duke flying around using a jet-pack. Yes, that&#x27;s Guerrilla Radio by Rage Against the Machine.

But beyond affecting your TV, there will be options to also dim your console&#x27;s controller light and power button - which can end up feeling quite bright in a dark room.

                    <span>Modders have restored the original destination names to Crazy Taxi on Steam.
Sega&#x27;s wonderful 1999 arcade racing game first launched with prominent product placement, including destinations modelled after real-life brands such as Pizza Hut, KFC, Tower Records and FILA. Remember FILA? There was a time FILA trainers were all the rage. I remember.
The original arcade version of Crazy Taxi and its initial ports to Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, GameCube and PC included this product placement, but when it came to the 2010 release on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the 2011 release on Steam, the brands were replaced by fakes. Pesky video game re-licensing strikes again!

Hosted by Parris Lilly and Kate Yeager, Xbox promises to give in-depth updates to some of their previously announced first-party titles, alongside some third-party ones. 
We&#x27;re also expecting some updates for new releases coming this holiday season, and updates to Xbox Game Pass.

                    <span>Fortnite has wrapped up its Ariana Grande concert tour, though if you missed the event you can rewatch it in full below. 
The concert experience was available four times over the weekend, and seemed to pass smoothly with no technical issues or server hiccups. As each concert time neared, Fortnite slowly disabled its core match playlists and players assembled in its special Rift Tour mode.
Once inside, players were left to hang out on top of the island&#x27;s central UFO with friends or random players, with a few little bits and pieces to play around with. The video recap below picks up after this, just as the event&#x27;s countdown clock hits zero:

                    <span>Back 4 Blood&#x27;s early access beta reached a peak of 98,024 players on Steam over the weekend.
The beta was available to those who had pre-ordered the game or were lucky enough to grab a code from a giveaway like the one offered by Eurogamer on Friday.
One of the most anticipated games of the year, Back 4 Blood is being developed by Turtle Rock Studios, famed for its creation of the Left 4 Dead series.

Researchers at the security consultancy Dolos Group, hired to test the security of one client’s network, received a new Lenovo computer preconfigured to use the standard security stack for the organization. They received no test credentials, configuration details, or other information about the machine.

They were not only able to get into the BitLocker-encrypted computer, but then use the computer to get into the corporate network...</span>

According to Bloomberg, a recent deal struck between South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and ViacomCBS - allegedly valued at around $900 million (£648m) over six years - seals several new series and &quot;spinoff movies&quot; for streaming service, Paramount+.
The story also references a new &quot;3D video game that is set in the world of South Park&quot;, which will seemingly be developed not in collaboration with Ubisoft or its partners this time, but is instead underway at an &quot;in-house studio&quot;.

Given much of Marianne&#x27;s adventure is steeped in atmospheric sound and environmental storytelling, Bloober hopes to build on that by making the experience even more immersive thanks to the PS5&#x27;s responsive controller that it says will act as &quot;an extension of your senses&quot;.

In an interview with PC Gamer, Greg Coomer - who helped design Valve&#x27;s new handheld system - said the team felt it was &quot;actually better, all things considered, to not modify based on docked status or mobile status&quot;.
This means that players should not experience a dip in performance if they&#x27;re playing on the move, which makes it stand out from its chief competitor, the Nintendo Switch.

The record-breaking sale comes just a few weeks after a pristine sealed copy of Super Mario 64 sold for $1.56m (£1.12m), breaking the then-record for the highest amount anyone has paid for a video game.
It&#x27;s the latest in a line of high-profile auctions. According to the New York Times (£), this particular lot - a rare unopened copy of the original Super Mario Bros. for NES - was sold by Rally, a company that helps investors buy and sell shares in collectible assets.

                    <span>GTA 5 parent company Take-Two Interactive has confirmed it has three &quot;unannounced&quot; remasters or remakes underway.
The news came courtesy of Take-Two&#x27;s recent Q1 2022 earnings call (thanks, Resetera). Nestled at the bottom of a slide called &quot;Pipeline Details (as of 18th May, 2021)&quot;, the company said it had six &quot;new iterations of previously released titles&quot; in development.
Three were specified and already public knowledge - Grand Theft Auto 5: Expanded and Enhanced and Kerbal Space Program for current-gen systems, plus a standalone version GTA 5&#x27;s fan-favourite Grand Theft Auto Online - but three remain unknown.

                    <span>New World Interactive&#x27;s hardcore multiplayer tactical shooter Insurgency Sandstorm seemingly - and finally - has a release date on console: 29th September 2021.
&quot;Insurgency Sandstorm is coming to PS4 and Xbox!&quot; Maximum Games UK - a self-described &quot;boutique&quot; publisher - announced on Twitter. &quot;Engage in realistic modern firefights in the definitive tactical FPS! Battle in the war-torn environments of a contemporary conflict through a series of cooperative and multiplayer modes.&quot;
Interestingly, the tweet itself doesn&#x27;t give a release date and the brief video teaser included in the tweet only hints at a &quot;2021&quot; release, but the pre-order link takes us to UK games retailer GAME, and it&#x27;s here the specific date is given.

                    <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn has confirmed new character Seer will be nerfed &quot;in an upcoming patch&quot;.
Respawn&#x27;s Travis Nordin told participants in a Reddit AMA that while the Legend had &quot;brought a lot of new gameplay elements to the game&quot;, Seer&#x27;s particular skillset is &quot;a bit too strong&quot;.
As Emma explained earlier this week, complaints about how Seer&#x27;s abilities give him too much of an advantage in combat were piling up on the Apex subreddit. Many of these complaints are centred on Seer&#x27;s microdrones, which allows him to disrupt revives and shield battery regens.

The Orison landing zone is set on the Crusader gas giant, and includes a spaceport, a peace garden and other amenities befitting a sci-fi tourist destination. The trailer is below:
Crusader makes use of the initial implementation of Star Citizen&#x27;s Planetary Volumetric Clouds tech. The idea is to render multi-layered, volumetric clouds of varying scale within planetary atmospheres. Developer Cloud Imperium Games said this tech will be expanded in the future to add further detail to existing planets in the game.

Project Nomad was in the works in 2016, but failed to get further than the pitch stage.

Server-side Apply (SSA) has been promoted to GA in the Kubernetes v1.22 release. The GA milestone means you can depend on the feature and its API, without fear of future backwards-incompatible changes. GA features are protected by the Kubernetes deprecation policy.
What is Server-side Apply?
Server-side Apply helps users and controllers manage their resources through declarative configurations. Server-side Apply replaces the client side apply feature implemented by “kubectl apply” with a server-side implementation, permitting use by tools/clients other than kubectl. Server-side Apply is a new merging algorithm, as well as tracking of field ownership, running on the Kubernetes api-server. Server-side Apply enables new features like conflict d…</span>

                    <span>Kerbal Space Program studio Squad has finally brought development of its acclaimed space flight sim to a close, over a decade after the game&#x27;s first public release.
Kerbal Space Program - which initially launched into early access via Squad&#x27;s website in 2011 - gives players the opportunity to build and pilot their own fully-functional spaceships, rockets, and vehicles (while managing all aspects their alien race&#x27;s quest for the stars if they choose), using actual proper science-y systems, from realistic aerodynamic to orbital physics.
Since leaving early access back in 2015, Kerbal Space Program has remained in active development, receiving numerous updates and expansions along the way - there&#x27;s even a free &quot;next-gen&quot; update for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S due this autumn. However, Squad has now confirmed - after warning players the space flight sim&#x27;s 1.12 update would be its last major release back in June - that its decade-plus-long journey is officially at an end.

Smoke &amp; Thunder - which will be Pistol Whip&#x27;s second post-launch story campaign following last year&#x27;s retro-futuristic 2089 - tells the story of two sisters in a Wild West &quot;where trains, tech, and explosions set the scene for some exciting surprises&quot;. It features five new stages  (each with its own new music track) plus new weapons, mechanics, enemies, and a boss fight.
Smoke &amp; Thunder will be made available to all existing Pistol Whip owners in a free update that also includes an extensive new customisation system known as Styles.

                    <span>This month&#x27;s Rust update truly is a whopper, introducing a refreshed underwater biome with procedural underwater lab dungeons, submarines, torpedoes, sharks and more. 
The update, which launched yesterday, introduces procedurally-generated underwater labs to the world of Rust, which will come in a variety of shapes and sizes - but always with two entry points. They can be entered via a &quot;moonpool&quot; using a submarine (another new item that we&#x27;ll get to later). The labs also have CCTV to help you plan your route, along with microphones that let you &quot;broadcast your commands into the entire base&#x27;s network&quot;. 
Some labs even come with mess hall rooms that allow you to play high-stakes poker, or barbecue meat while listening to music with your pals. That all sounds relaxing, but there are also plenty of nefarious NPCs on board that want to spoil your day - best stay on your toes. You&#x27;ll find some tasty loot if you make it past these puzzles and enemies, so perhaps the reward is worth the risk.

                    <span>Fortnite has quietly pulled its new Bear Hug emote after a bug was discovered which left players crouched in a NSFW position. 
The friendly Bear Hug emote went on sale last night, priced 200 V-Bucks, ahead of this weekend&#x27;s huge Ariana Grande concert series. It&#x27;s a synced emote, which means other players can interact with someone performing it. 
But players quickly found the emote was a bit too friendly. Epic Games has now removed the emote from sale.

                    <span>Manchester United will be renamed Manchester UFC from Football Manager 22 onwards after the resolution of a trademark dispute.
The Premier League club sued Football Manager publisher Sega in May last year, 16 years after the release of Sports Interactive&#x27;s first Football Manager game, and 28 years after the launch of the first Championship Manager game.
Manchester United had launched legal action against Sega and Sports Interactive for infringing its trademark.

                    <span>The Shamblers from The Last of Us Part 2 had big explosive bums in an early build of the game. 
As spotted by TechnClub, Matthew Gallant, lead systems designer at Naughty Dog, shared a clip of what appears to be a test environment with Ellie in combat with a few Shamblers that have a very different appearance to their look in the final game. 
As you can see in the video below, the Shamblers&#x27; bums were bright and appeared to explode and exert a gaseous acid.

It appears that Krafton has re-branded PUBG to PUBG: Battlegrounds - with the new name now appearing on the game&#x27;s social media feeds and Steam (via PC Gamer). That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s now PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds: Battlegrounds. 
This apparently happened sometime in July, and appears to have something to do with Krafton&#x27;s plans to create a PUBG universe.

In Career Mode across all platforms, there are news items focused on your stats and accomplishments that trigger when certain milestone events happen (for example, when you or one of your player&#x27;s goal projection is to break a competition&#x27;s goal record and when you or they finally succeed in doing so).

In a statement to The Washington Post, Coca-Cola said it was &quot;aware of the allegations surrounding Activision Blizzard&quot; and is &quot;working with our partners at Blizzard as we take a step back for a moment to revisit future plans and programs&quot;. 
State Farm, one of the largest insurance providers in the United States, is also pulling back, stating it was &quot;reevaluating our limited marketing relationship with the Overwatch League&quot;. It has asked that &quot;no advertisements run during the matches this weekend&quot;.

AA publisher Focus bought 77.5 percent of the share capital of Dotemu, the French company that focuses on developing and publishing retro-themed games.
Dotemu, which is made up of about 30 staff, worked alongside Lizardcube and Guard Crush Games to publish the critically-acclaimed Streets of Rage 4. Martin dished out a coveted Essential badge in Eurogamer&#x27;s Streets of Rage 4 review, calling it &quot;a sequel that manages to best its forebears&quot;. Streets of Rage 4 has now been played by two-and-a-half million people.

                    <span>Data processing pipelines have ever-growing requirements for speed and throughput. It’s no longer enough to store data and save it to batch processing at some future time. We need to be able to process data in real time to make snap decisions and get immediate insights.

                    <span>Fascinating research: “Generating Master Faces for Dictionary Attacks with a Network-Assisted Latent Space Evolution.”
Abstract: A master face is a face image that passes face-based identity-authentication for a large portion of the population. These faces can be used to impersonate, with a high probability of success, any user, without having access to any user-information. We optimize these faces, by using an evolutionary algorithm in the latent embedding space of the StyleGAN face generator. Multiple evolutionary strategies are compared, and we propose a novel approach that employs a neural network in order to direct the search in the direction of promising samples, without adding fitness evaluations. The results we present demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a high coverage of the population (over 40%) with less than 10 master faces, for three leading deep face recognition systems...</span>

                    <span>Saber Interactive&#x27;s Evil Dead game will no longer release this year as originally planned, and is now targeting a PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC launch in February 2022.
Evil Dead: The Game casts players as familiar faces from all across the Evil Dead franchise, bringing them together in co-operative union to battle the forces of darkness - chainsaws (and other assorted melee and ranged weapons) in hand. Adding an extra wrinkle to the core co-op action is a PvP component in which another player becomes the Kandarian Demon itself, able to roam the map in a bid to thwart the humans&#x27; plans.
According to the gameplay trailer released earlier this year, human players will need hunt down pages of the Necronomicon, Raymond Knowby&#x27;s tapes, and other artefacts in order to cast the spell needed to vanquish the demon and win a match, all of which sounds very much in the Dead by Daylight/Friday the 13th: The Game mold.

                    <span>Sony&#x27;s been having a bit of an indie shindig over on the PlayStation Blog, ushering in seven announcements and reveals that might just leave PS4 and PS5 owners slightly aquiver. And if you missed them, you&#x27;ll find everything gathered up into one convenient digest below.
Adam Robinson-Yu&#x27;s much-loved open-world exploration game A Short Hike, in which a small bird goes on a brief but thoroughly delightful mountain-climbing adventure, is coming to PlayStation consoles some time this autumn. We liked this one a lot when it released for PC back in 2019 - Christian Donlan called it &quot;dreamy brilliance&quot; in his Essential review - so it&#x27;s definitely one to keep an eye out for.
Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, the sequel to developer Night School Studio&#x27;s deliciously eerie 2016 narrative adventure, is also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation consoles. It&#x27;s set to feature an &quot;entirely new&quot; cast of characters - players control Riley Poverly as she investigates strange electromagnetic signals in her home town of Camena - while retaining, as Night School puts  it, &quot;the weird, heartfelt, and personalised experience of the original&quot;. Previous word suggested Oxenfree 2 will launch later this year.

                    <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;mass multiplayer outdoor extreme sports game&quot; Riders Republic will begin its previously announced beta later this month on 23rd August.
Riders Republic is something of a spiritual successor to Ubisoft&#x27;s under-appreciated winter sports effort Steep, but while that game focussed exclusively on snowy pursuits, Riders Republic encompasses a broader range of activities, including biking and wing suit action (both vanilla and jet-powered) alongside skiing and snowboarding.
Players can experience Riders Republic&#x27;s world - which is stitched together from seven iconic US national parks: Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Grand Teton, Mammoth Mountain, Sequoia Park, Yosemite Valley, and Zion - both solo and co-operatively. However, Ubisoft is heavily pushing the game&#x27;s large-scale competitions, which include races with upward of 50 players.

                    <span>Pokémon Go&#x27;s most high profile players have called upon developer Niantic to reconsider its decision to remove the game&#x27;s extended interaction range, which was implemented last year as the pandemic hit. 
Influencers, YouTubers and community leaders have today used their sizable social media footprints to all share an open letter to Niantic setting out the reasons why they believe the game&#x27;s extended interaction distance should remain, several days after it was reverted in the US and New Zealand. 
The list of reasons includes being able to play while further socially distanced, and keeping the game extra accessible for less able players. Other reasons listed include being able to play further away from the general public for personal safety reasons, and further away from businesses or landmarks to avoid congestion.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a new Apex Legend in town, but Seer might be bringing a little too much firepower to the table - as Apex Legends players are complaining that his abilities are too powerful. Some are even comparing his abilities to &quot;wallhacks&quot;, and many are calling for the character to be nerfed. 
Over on the Apex Legends subreddit, complaints are piling in about how Seer&#x27;s abilities stack up to give him too much of an advantage in combat. Many of these complaints are centred on Seer&#x27;s microdrones - and the fact they&#x27;re seemingly the Swiss army knife of Legend abilities. Not only does the tactical ability do damage, it also reveals enemy locations (including health bars) and interrupts actions such as healing.
While Seer&#x27;s tactical does take some time to travel, players have found that it has a surprisingly large hitbox, as you can see from the experiment below... and the poor soul hiding inside a building who got caught out by the ability. It&#x27;s also a seemingly unstoppable force that can go through mountains.

                    <span>Surprise! Nintendo has announced a free update for Mario Golf: Super Rush, which will be available to download tomorrow. 
This adds a new Ranked Match mode, a new course themed around Super Mario Odyssey&#x27;s New Donk City and - honestly, best of all - Toadette.
Footage of Toadette shows her using the Super Pickax item from Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker to fire off her golf shots. She can also dash across golf courses while flinging the vegetables from Super Mario Bros. 2.

                    <span>Twitch will lower the cost of Tier 1 subscriptions in the UK from £4.99 to £3.99, starting this week.
The change is part of a wider programme to introduce local pricing relative to the cost of living and exchange rates in every region.  
Under the existing pricing structure, UK subscribers were paying approximately $7 USD per sub, significantly higher than the $4.99 paid by Americans. The new price is therefore much fairer to subscribers outside the United States.

Retitled as Bubble Bobble 4 Friends: The Baron&#x27;s Workshop, this will feature all of the extra bits and pieces added as DLC to the game on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. 
On top of that, Steam Workshop will support the new map maker mode and let you share creations with friends.

                    <span>In a bold move that certainly didn&#x27;t pay off, a pair of PlayStation 5 development kits appeared on eBay yesterday - although the listings didn&#x27;t last more than a few hours before being removed. 
As spotted by Twitter user iDCx1337, the listings were for a DFI-D1000AA dev kit and a DFI-T1000AA test kit (thanks, Kotaku). A screenshot of the DFI-D1000AA dev kit, complete with two all-black DualSense controllers, showed that the listing apparently reached a bidding price of €2850 (£2423) before being pulled.   
It remains unclear whether eBay decided to remove the listings or whether Sony got involved, but either way, the listings apparently only survived a few hours before they mysteriously vanished. We still don&#x27;t know how the seller got their hands on these kits: dev kits are normally given out to developers under strict NDA. It seems these two have somehow managed to trickle down into the hands of someone who was willing to take a punt on an eBay listing.

                    <span>Shipments of the main Switch console actually increased year-on-year, though a fall for the Switch Lite model offset that, leading to an overall decrease for the last quarter of 21.7 percent. 
In its latest earnings briefing, Nintendo pointed to last year&#x27;s sales boom &quot;substantially driven&quot; by Animal Crossing: New Horizons as providing tough comparisons.

                    <span>Steve Gaynor, co-founder of Gone Home and Tacoma developer Fullbright, has stepped down as the studio&#x27;s creative lead and manager. 
Fullbright officially announced the change last night, ahead of a Polygon report which detailed an exodus of staff at the company &quot;at least in part due to Gaynor&#x27;s behaviour toward workers&quot;. 
Gaynor will remain a writer on Open Roads, the upcoming Annapurna-published story of a mother and daughter, which will now no longer be released in 2021.

The proposed settlement would generally give Zoom users $15 or $25 each and was filed Saturday at US District Court for the Northern District of California. It came nine months after Zoom agreed to security improvements and a “prohibition on privacy and security misrepresentations” in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, but the FTC settlement didn’t include compensation for users...</span>

                    <span>Authors: Kubernetes 1.22 Release Team
We’re pleased to announce the release of Kubernetes 1.22, the second release of 2021!
This release consists of 53 enhancements: 13 enhancements have graduated to stable, 24 enhancements are moving to beta, and 16 enhancements are entering alpha. Also, three features have been deprecated.
In April of this year, the Kubernetes release cadence was officially changed from four to three releases yearly. This is the first longer-cycle release related to that change. As the Kubernetes project matures, the number of enhancements per cycle grows. This means more work, from version to version, for the contributor community and Release Engineering team, and it can put pressure on the end-user community to stay up-to-date with releases containing increasingly more…</span>

                    <span>Fall Guys, developer Mediatonic&#x27;s knockabout battle royale game, is celebrating its first anniversary today, 4th August, with a selection of special, minimally priced birthday cosmetics and a trip down memory lane as it wheels out its original stages.
While Fall Guys&#x27; fifth, jungled-themed season continues to be the main event, players currently have the option to tumble back to where it all began with the special Anniversary Party show, featuring the game&#x27;s original roster of rounds.
And for those wanting to dress for the occasion, Mediatonic has added two birthday cosmetics to the in-game store - a special body suit, emblazoned with cakes, balloons, and the like, plus a fetching birthday crown. They can be purchased for a meagre 10 Kudos each.

                    <span>Eurogamer fans of a certain age, prepare for a swift punch to the nostalgia nubbin; Sumo Digital is resurrecting 90s Amiga mascot Zool for a new platform adventure on PC.
Zool, also known as the ninja of the Nth Dimension, returns later this month in Zool Redimensioned, a &quot;brand-new reimagining&quot; of the old-school, Gremlin-Graphics-developed platform series that&#x27;s been &quot;rebuilt from the ground up for modern audiences&quot;.
&quot;Help Zool jump, spin and shoot his way across eight alien worlds, taking down menacing bosses and saving the universe from the nefarious influence of Krool,&quot; explains the developer on Zool Redimensioned&#x27;s Steam page. &quot;Beat your speed run times, discover secrets hidden across every level, or go back in time and play the original classic game.&quot;

                    <span>Amazon&#x27;s massively multiplayer online title New World has been delayed again but this time only by around a month, with the game now expected to launch on PC on 28th September.
Announcing New World&#x27;s fourth delay in a statement posted to Twitter, Amazon Game Studios wrote, &quot;We are humbled by the support New World received from players around the world throughout closed beta. During beta, more than a million adventurers played more than 16 million total hours... The passion and enthusiasm you&#x27;ve shown for New World validates the work we&#x27;ve put in over the past year, improving the game based on your feedback&quot;. 
&quot;We want New World&#x27;s launch to be a smooth and fun experience for all players,&quot; the studio continued, &quot;and that means making some improvements based on what you encountered during closed beta. So we&#x27;re going to take a few extra weeks to smash bugs, improve stability, and polish the game.&quot; This, it says, means a new global launch date of 28th September.

                    <span>Games shows might be lacking some of their old-time bombast since the pandemic forced a shift to digital-only presentations, but there&#x27;s no denying the continuing thrill of a flashy announcement show. And we now have firm details of the next biggie as Geoff Keighley prepares his Keighleymobile and readies to ride out for Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live.
This year&#x27;s Opening Night Live marks the third annual outing for the show since its debut back in 2019, and the second time it&#x27;ll be taking the form of a digital-only event. It&#x27;ll be held on Wednesday 25th August, slightly later than previously announced, and we now know exactly when we&#x27;ll be expected to grasp snacks and take our seats as things get underway.
As confirmed by Keighley, who&#x27;ll once again be presenting, over on Twitter, the 2021 showcase will run for two hours, with proceedings kicking off at an entirely reasonable 7pm in the UK/11am PT. There&#x27;s no mention of a pre-show yet, but last year&#x27;s started half an hour before the main event, so if you just can&#x27;t resist a good old-fashioned pre-ample, you might want to block out a bit more time in your diary.

                    <span>Ever heard of Blackpink? If not, well, a lot of people sure have - the band was the first K-pop girl group to reach 1bn views on YouTube, and they&#x27;re currently the most subscribed-to music group on the platform (via Vogue UK). And now the group is coming to PUBG with their very own crossover event. 
Between 18th August to 7th September players will be able to participate in &quot;special in-game event missions&quot; to earn points to acquire Blackpink-themed items, including a level three helmet and contraband coupons. And there&#x27;s plenty more in-game items where that came from: 35 distinct items will be on sale in total, and will be purchasable from today until the end of the year. Each of the band members will have their own cosmetic bundles (each of which includes &quot;themed hair, an outfit, a nameplate, helmet, weapon and emote&quot;). 
PUBG&#x27;s maps will also see some changes as part of the event. Blackpink-themed decorations such as building decals, plane banners, supply crates and level three helmets will appear from today until 7th September on PC, and from 12th August to 15th September on consoles.

Legends is also getting some upgrades: a new two-versus-two mode named Rivals you can see in action below, an updated gear mastery progression system, new cosmetics and new Trophies.

                    <span>In the vanilla version of Cyberpunk 2077, you may find yourself wearing some absurd clothing combinations just for the sake of your armour stat. Bucket hats and high heels, biking boots and pencil skirts - it all goes on just to increase that number. What you wear in Night City doesn&#x27;t have much of an impact on your interactions with others, but one modder has introduced a system to make clothes more meaningful.  
StreetStyle - Immersive Fashion System adds more depth to Cyberpunk&#x27;s existing clothing system by tying your outfits to the game&#x27;s skill checks. The PC mod gives each item of clothing specific skill bonuses in Strength, Reflexes, Technical, Intelligence and Cool (with a value between one and five for each category). These combine with your base stats to give you skill boosts that comes in handy for skill checks - such as those found in dialogue and device interactions. Items have been assigned stats according to their actual purpose: wearing Netrunning equipment, for instance, will boost your Intelligence stat - but it won&#x27;t provide much help with Strength and Reflexes, as the suits are not designed for combat.   
You can&#x27;t simply boost your stats into the stratosphere, too: StreetStyle also adjusts the difficulty of skill checks to prevent them from being too easy with the buffs. The mod calculates your clothing bonus by adding up the total of all your clothing items for a single attribute, then dividing that number by seven, and adding it to your base stat.

Beat will be available to unlock for all players for free at launch, Sega revealed via Twitter today. That&#x27;s in contrast to an array of other retro skins which you will have to pay for.

                    <span>Activision Blizzard has begun teasing the next big Call of Duty game under the shadow cast by the recently-filed discrimination lawsuit.
Yesterday, as Activision Blizzard executives such as boss Bobby Kotick insisted &quot;we will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry&quot; during a financial call aimed at the investor community, a coalition of workers from across multiple Activision Blizzard studios criticised the decision to hire WilmerHale, the same law firm helping Amazon keep its workers from unionising, to review the company.
As reported by IGN, the employees, collectively called the ABK Workers Alliance, said Kotick did not &quot;meaningfully address&quot; workers&#x27; demands following last week&#x27;s high-profile employee walkout.

Pokémon Go features a few Galar-region creatures already, but only forms and evolutions of existing Pokémon such as Zigzagoon and Ponyta. Now, developer Niantic is rolling out more of the Pokémon&#x27;s Gen 8 - including its signature Legendaries.

                    <span>Grand Theft Auto Online players are walking around in circles while AFK to grind for Tuner RP in the new Los Santos Tuners update. 
As reported by Kotaku, the update&#x27;s new reputation system has a huge rank cap of 1000 and reaching the higher levels takes a lot of time. The only way to earn RP is through Tuner races, testing out new cards, and passively by walking around the car meet. 
Players have figured out the passive RP method can be exploited easily. As long as they can keep their character moving around in the car meet, they won&#x27;t be booted from a server for inactivity and can get on with something else in the real world.

                    <span>If you ever felt like Skyrim&#x27;s third-person gameplay could do with an update to give it a more modern action-RPG feel, this could be just the ticket. 
&quot;True Directional Movement - Modernised Third Person Gameplay&quot; is a mod by Ershin for Skyrim: Special Edition on PC that, well, does exactly what it says on the tin. The mod overhauls Skyrim&#x27;s third-person gameplay to allow you to move and attack from any direction, while there&#x27;s also a target lock component to help you keep track of enemies. This target lock comes with an animated health bar widget above enemies, with bosses getting their own (much larger) health bars. 
Here&#x27;s a demonstration of what all this looks like in practice:

Addressing investors during Activision Blizzard&#x27;s Q2 2021 results call this evening, Kotick said, &quot;I want to start by making clear to everyone that there&#x27;s no place in our company where discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind will be tolerated. Nowhere.
&quot;We so appreciate the current and former employees who&#x27;ve come forward in past recent days with courage and I want to reiterate the commitments we&#x27;ve made to you. Our work environment, everywhere we operate, will not permit discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment. We will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry.&quot;

                    <span>Left 4 Dead 2&#x27;s iconic survivor line-up is embarking on another undead adventure, this time appearing as playable characters in developer Rebellion&#x27;s Zombie Army 4: Dead War.
Coach, Ellis, Nick, and Rochelle - who debuted in Valve&#x27;s seminal co-operative FPS sequel all the way back in 2009 (and who finally returned to action in 2020&#x27;s official The Last Stand update) - come to Zombie Army 4 as part of Rebellion&#x27;s free Left 4 Dead Character Pack 2, available now on all platforms. They follow the original Left 4 Dead&#x27;s cast, who joined Zombie Army 4 as playable characters earlier this year.
The new group&#x27;s arrival coincides with Zombie Army 4&#x27;s Season 3 finale, which wraps up its current storyline in new campaign mission Return to Hell. &quot;Our intrepid squad [are thrust] back into the underworld,&quot; teases Rebellion, &quot;but this time it is a haunted manifestation of Schweiger&#x27;s mind which they must survive in order to free him from Baron Umbra.&quot;

                    <span>World War Z, the smash-hit co-operative zombie shooter from Saber Interactive, will be embarking on adventures in exotic (and undead-infested) new locales starting 21st September, with the arrival of its major Aftermath expansion for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.
Aftermath, which will be available as a paid update for existing World War Z owners and as an all-in standalone release for newcomers, is intended to give the two-year-old zombie shooter a significant shot in the arm. 
It contains everything previously released as part of World War Z&#x27;s Game of the Year edition, including all seven of its PvE story episodes, split across 23 maps in New York, Moscow, Jerusalem, Marseilles, and Tokyo. It also brings gameplay enhancements and brand-new content, including new locations, survivors, and more.

Art of Rally, which initially launched on PC toward the end of last year, delivers a top-down, faintly retro twist on the rally racing formula, sending players careening across low-poly renditions of Finland, Germany, Japan, Norway, and Sardinia as they tackle its 60 rally stages.
It features 61 &quot;iconic&quot; rally cars from the 60s to the 80s, and includes daily and weekly leaderboard challenges, ghost racing, and more alongside its sizeable career mode - all unfolding to the beat of Art of Rally&#x27;s delicious, 80s-hued synth soundtrack.

                    <span>PlayStation 4 Rainbow Six Siege players in Japan have said the game is being ruined by what have been dubbed AFK &quot;bouncers&quot;.
Players of Ubisoft&#x27;s competitive multiplayer shooter have complained they are constantly joining matches where other players are exploiting the way the game works in Japan to farm for in-game currency.
This in-game currency, known as Renown, is earned primarily by completing matches. You can also earn some extra Renown from daily challenges and from Ubisoft Connect, which is Ubisoft&#x27;s cross-platform social and loyalty hub. Players use Renown to unlock operators, weapon attachments and customisation items.

The Wayward Realms is an open-world RPG being made by a team that includes Ted Peterson, Julian LeFay and Vijay Lakshman (who all worked on the Elder Scrolls series). Developer Once Lost Games describes it as a &quot;new class of game&quot; called &quot;the Grand RPG,&quot; promising in-depth class and combat systems, complex faction dynamics, and &quot;choice and consequence... experienced on a scale never attempted before&quot;. 
&quot;The Wayward Realms is set on a group of over one hundred islands, ranging from small to massive, known collectively as the Archipelago, where scores of factions vie for influence and power,&quot; says the official game description. &quot;Dynasties strive to maintain the status quo, upstarts seek to earn their place at the top, and intriguing power-houses set generational plots into motion.

But in a statement to IGN, McDonald&#x27;s Australia stated that &quot;the image was provided to media in error and there is no commercial relationship between McDonald&#x27;s Australia and Sony PlayStation.&quot; 
The controllers were covered with a motif of the brand&#x27;s signature Big Mac and Fries, with yellow-coloured buttons and a massive McDonald&#x27;s logo centred on the touchpad, just to remind you who your fast-food overlord is.

Addressing questions about the game in a Twitter thread, Konami asked itself: &quot;is early autumn launch basically a demo?&quot;
&quot;In many ways, yes,&quot; Konami said. &quot;We want people to get hands-on with eFootball as soon as possible, so we will launch with a limited number of teams and modes. Exact details to follow.&quot;

Paragon’s product will also likely get spyware critics and surveillance experts alike rubbernecking: It claims to give police the power to remotely break into encrypted instant messaging communications, whether that’s WhatsApp, Signal, Facebook Messenger or Gmail, the industry sources said. One other spyware industry executive said it also promises to get longer-lasting access to a device, even when it’s rebooted.
[…]
Two industry sources said they believed Paragon was trying to set itself apart further by promising to get access to the instant messaging applications on a device, rather than taking complete control of everything on a phone. One of the sources said they understood that Paragon’s spyware exploits the protocols of end-to-end encrypted apps, meaning it would hack into messages via vulnerabilities in the core ways in which the software operates...</span>

                    <span>Publisher Take-Two says it&#x27;ll be announcing an &quot;exciting new franchise&quot; later this month with a release planned before the end of the current fiscal year in March 2022. 
The news (as spotted by VGC) comes via Take-Two&#x27;s Q1 2022 earnings call and follows pre-E3 leaks earlier this year - corroborated by VentureBeat&#x27;s Jeff Grubb - revealing two new unannounced games from the publisher.
Mafia 3 studio Hangar 13 is said to be working on a title described as &quot;Cthulhu meets Saints Row&quot; while XCOM developer Firaxis is reportedly creating a Marvel-themed turn-based strategy game. And while Take-Two offered no hint as to nature of its &quot;new franchise&quot; in its earnings call, this month&#x27;s Gamescom digital event seems a likely candidate for a full reveal.

                    <span>If it&#x27;s story you want with your Battlefield 2042 now that Dice has confirmed there won&#x27;t be a single-player campaign this time around, your next best thing might very well be arriving in the form of an official short film tie-in set to debut next week.
Dice announced the existence of its new &quot;standalone&quot; cinematic short, titled Exodus, over on Twitter earlier today, revealing the mini-movie will detail the events that ultimately &quot;trigger an all-out war&quot; within the universe of 2042.
As Eurogamer&#x27;s Martin Robinson explained earlier this year, despite Battlefield 2042 eschewing a solo campaign to focus on multiplayer, it does still play out against a narrative backdrop: a humanitarian crisis brought about by climate change, where nomadic refugees known as No-Pats take up arms as the United States and Russia engage in &quot;all-out war&quot;.

                    <span>Another month means a fresh batch of additions to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Now service, with August&#x27;s offerings now confirmed to be Nier: Automata, Ghostrunner, and Undertale.
Nier: Automata is probably the biggest eye-catcher, providing another opportunity to experience developer Platinum Games&#x27; celebrated action-RPG. Creator Yoko Taro&#x27;s second Nier outing - which follows the dystopian travails of androids 2B and 9S - is as richly atmospheric and dizzyingly inventive as its predecessor, mixing Platinum&#x27;s tried-and-tested hack-and-slash action with ample genre-busting surprises as its layers are gradually revealed.
&quot;Those searching for an endlessly imaginative dreamlike journey,&quot; wrote Jeffrey Matulef in his Recommended review, &quot;will find Nier: Automata too mesmerising to look away from.

                    <span>Well, it may not come as a massive surprise, but the Ariana Grande concert for Fortnite has now been confirmed - and it&#x27;s taking place 6th-8th August.
Ariana will headline a concert called the Rift Tour, which will &quot;begin with experiences that pair popular tracks with moments based on elements from the game&quot;.
&quot;Players will be able to travel side by side with their friends on a journey to magical new realities where Fortnite and Ariana collide,&quot; the press release explains.

                    <span>Of course this is hackable:
A sophisticated telecommunications satellite that can be completely repurposed while in space has launched. 
[…]
Because the satellite can be reprogrammed in orbit, it can respond to changing demands during its lifetime.
[…]
The satellite can detect and characterise any rogue emissions, enabling it to respond dynamically to accidental interference or intentional jamming.

We can assume strong encryption, and good key management. Still, seems like a juicy target for other governments.</span>

                    <span>To usher in Black Panther&#x27;s arrival on 16th August, Marvel&#x27;s Avengers is having a free trial weekend on Steam, PlayStation, and Stadia. It kicked off on 29th July and ends later today, 1st August, sending interest in the action game on PC soaring.
Looking at SteamDB (thanks, TheGamer), the game usually averages around only a few hundred concurrent users at a time, but the freeplay event has set a 24-hour peak of 10,161 players - with 10,121 online right now at the time of writing.
It doesn&#x27;t quite hit the heights of its launch period - Marvel&#x27;s Avengers peaked at almost 32,000 Steam players when it released last September - but it&#x27;s a considerable spike for a game that had hitherto struggled to get even 1000 simultaneous PC players online.

                    <span>Valve has reportedly sanctioned the release of Half-Life 2: Remastered Collection, a passion-project mod that &quot;completely overhauls&quot; the seminal shooter. 
As noted by SteamDB (thanks, PCGN), the collection comes from Filip Victor and is &quot;not Valve related&quot;, but Tyler McVicker - who focuses on news about Valve and Steam - reports that the remaster has &quot;Valve&#x27;s consent&quot;.
It&#x27;s apparently the next iteration of the fantastic mod Half-Life 2: Update, a &quot;completely free and extensive community-developed update for Half-Life 2 featuring beautiful lighting, countless bug fixes, and a brand new Community Commentary Mode&quot;. It&#x27;s available to anyone who owns Half-Life 2 on PC and offers &quot;countless&quot; bug fixes in &quot;one free standalone download&quot;.

                    <span>Microsoft has teamed with Krispy Kreme doughnuts to mark 20 glorious years of Master Chief.
To celebrate Halo&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the doughnut purveyor has created a special edition Halo Infinite doughnut that boasts blue icing and a familiar helmet. It&#x27;ll be available between 30th July and 30th September, although right now - I&#x27;m very sorry to say - it seems limited to Krispy Kreme Brazil.
That&#x27;s not the only thing getting Halo fans excited, though. The advertisement has some people speculating that the ad has solidified Halo Infinite&#x27;s vague &quot;Q4 2021&quot; release window, too, teasing: &quot;Why wait for November?&quot;

                    <span>Most of the 2000+ accounts recently banned from playing Apex Legends for &quot;dashboarding&quot; or exploiting matchmaking in Ranked mode had been playing on PS4.
The statistic came courtesy of Conor Ford, who manages Apex security at developer Respawn. They confirmed that of the 2086 players banned on 29th July 2021, 1965 had been playing on PS4, 62 on Xbox, 44 on PC, and 15 on Nintendo Switch.
The ban hammer primarily targeted players caught &quot;dashboarding&quot;, players who forcefully shut down the game at the end of a losing match to avoid losing RP. By abusing it, players can erroneously maintain their high-rank status but thankfully, Respawn noticed the trend.

                    <span>Fortnite is &quot;a nightmare&quot; for AS Roma manager, José Mourinho.
In a &quot;rapid response&quot; Q&amp;A video shared on the football team&#x27;s social media channels during which &quot;The boss&quot; gave his opinion on a myriad of things - from life in Italy to his views on Instagram - Mourinho said that his players spent too much time on Epic Games&#x27; fan-favourite battle royale, staying up &quot;all night&quot; and implying it affects their performances on the field the following day.
When asked what he thought of the game, he smiled and said: &quot;a nightmare&quot;.

                    <span>Final Fantasy 14 developer Square Enix has revealed it will redesign the logo for new job sage following fan feedback that for some, it triggered their trypophobia - a phobia of holes.
Taking to the official website to explain the changes, Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s producer and director Naoki Yoshida said that the team didn&#x27;t think the job&#x27;s icon was a &quot;particularly big&quot; deal, but soon &quot;received feedback from players all over the world&quot; that the icon &quot;made them uncomfortable or fearful&quot;.
&quot;This aversion is known as trypophobia, and those who have it feel disgust and fear when they see clusters of small holes or bumps,&quot; Yoshida explained (thanks, PC Gamer). &quot;The severity of the reaction varies between people, and what triggers it in some may not do so in others.

                    <span>Halo Infinite launched its multiplayer technical preview this week in limited fashion: all you can do is play against bots - but these bots are no pushover.
Halo Infinite is the franchise&#x27;s first foray into the world of multiplayer bots, and developer 343 is using the technical preview to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance. To that end, the technical preview debuted with the Bot Arena playlist, which puts four players against four bots on arena maps.
The technical preview launched with bots that felt pretty easy, and last night I won every game against them. But while I slept, 343 pushed an update that added ODST difficulty bots and a new map, Recharge. And I am here to report these ODST bots are not messing about.

In a new video, below, Sheffield-based developer Steel City Interactive showed an updated look at gameplay, running through its various mechanics, control system for evasion, combat and combinations, with all the dodging, weaving, blocking and slips you&#x27;d expect from a boxing sim.

In truth, the video doesn&#x27;t tell us much at all about naval warfare in Age of Empires 4, but we do get a look at the ships and the water.

The Ascent, published by Curve Digital and developed by Neon Giant, came out this week (check out our review to see what we thought) on PC and Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S, with a day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass.
Players soon discovered the Game Pass version lacks some of the graphics features of the Steam version. Specifically, the Game Pass version does not support Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) tech, and ray tracing simply doesn&#x27;t work.

                    <span>More allegations about Activision Blizzard have emerged this week following the recent lawsuit filed by the State of California alleging pervasive discrimination and harassment against women at the World of Warcraft maker.
More than 2000 current and former Activision Blizzard employees signed a petition calling the company&#x27;s response to the recent discrimination lawsuit &quot;abhorrent and insulting&quot;.
Activision Blizzard&#x27;s initial public comment on the lawsuit was to strongly deny its claims. An email then sent to staff by Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend, who was the assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism to George W. Bush from 2004 to 2008, has been heavily criticised by staff.

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West, the highly anticipated follow-up to Guerrilla Games&#x27; acclaimed open-world action-adventure Horizon Zero Dawn, has reportedly been delayed into 2022.
Announced last summer, Horizon Forbidden West was originally set to launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5 toward the end of this year; however, Sony hinted a slip might be possible back it June, when it announced God of War: Ragnarok would now be a 2022 title. &quot;We think we are on track to release [Horizon Forbidden West] this holiday season,&quot; said PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst at the time, &quot;But that isn&#x27;t quite certain yet, and we&#x27;re working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can.&quot;
Hints that Sony was now leaning toward delaying Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s release into next year first surfaced yesterday, courtesy of GameBeat journalist Jeff Grubb, who suggested the company was still &quot;undecided&quot; on the matter during his Giant Bomb show. However, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier has now weighed in with the more definite statement that &quot;Sony has delayed the PlayStation exclusive... to the first quarter of 2022&quot;, according to his source.

                    <span>Developer Two Point Studios&#x27; wonderful medical management sim Two Point Hospital is getting in on Sonic&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebrations with a free selection of costumes and items for all platforms inspired by the hedgehog&#x27;s video game adventures.
The snappily titled Sonic the Hedgehog Pack is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam as part of Two Point Hospital&#x27;s latest update, bringing a total of four outfits for hospital staff to wear - based on Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles - as well as various theme-appropriate decorations. There&#x27;s a massive Sonic statue, for instance, plus the likes of Sonic rugs and posters, stylised sunflowers and palm trees, totem poles, and even a big ol&#x27; spinning gold ring.
Sonic&#x27;s Two Point Hospital intrusion comes as the management sim enjoys a variety of heavy discounts and promotional events across different platforms. There&#x27;s a free trial on Switch until 8th August for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in certain countries - as well as 30% off the game and all DLC - and it&#x27;s currently free to play for all Steam users until 2nd August. Discounts there include 75% off the base game and up to 50% off all DLC until 5th August.

                    <span>Icarus, the sci-fi survival game from DayZ creator Dean Hall, will no longer launch on 11th August as originally announced and is now expected to arrive some time this November.
Icarus (now a full-price release after developer RocketWerkz pivoted away from its initial free-to-play plans) casts players as deep-space prospectors attempting to salvage what they can from the surface of a hostile alien planet following a terraforming disaster.
&quot;Icarus was once destined to be a second Earth,&quot; explains the game&#x27;s Steam page, &quot;but when terraforming collapsed, the air turned toxic and humanity&#x27;s hopes of colonising a new world died... Yet when xeno-biologists discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these &#x27;exotics&#x27; sparked a gold rush, fuelling political tensions on Earth, and bringing prospectors flocking to Icarus.&quot;

                    <span>We&#x27;ve all been there - chests overflowing with gold, rubies on the floor, amber pearls somehow floating around in your food storage. And not a merchant in sight to help you spend it all. But the upcoming Hearth and Home update for Valheim should help with your treasure storage problems, as it&#x27;s due to add a bunch of shiny new items to help you create your own bank vault.
As explained in a blog post, the developers at Iron Gate are now returning from their summer holidays to continue work on Hearth and Home, which is the first major update for Valheim since its launch. The team are apparently still on track to deliver the update &quot;this very quarter&quot;, so we shouldn&#x27;t have to wait much longer to see all the delicious goodies arriving in the patch (like Eyescream, Shocklate Smoothies and the ominously-named &quot;wolf meats&quot;). 
This update isn&#x27;t just about food, however, and you&#x27;ll soon be able to create your very own treasure trove. Coin stacks and coin piles will be added as items that can be crafted from your excess gold. If you don&#x27;t want it all on display, you can store your bling in a special treasure chest. And if you want to secure all your earnings, you might want to craft the new iron gate.

                    <span>With the upcoming release of the Steam Deck, it looks like Valve is adding more quality of life improvements to Steam.
A new update has been released in the beta channel, bringing a new storage manager. 
The new interface features a tabbed view listing all the drives in your system, a visual representation of what types of files are taking up storage (games, DLC, and other apps), and a list of all the games in each drive.

                    <span>In what appears to be a world first, a Twitch streamer has completed a blindfolded speedrun of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Yep, you read that right. 
Earlier this week streamer Mitchriz completed Sekiro&#x27;s Shura ending with a time of four hours, 35 minutes and 13 seconds, all while blindfolded. Here&#x27;s a clip of the moment he completed the run - spoilers for the final boss, obviously:
It&#x27;s worth watching the rest of the run, too, as it&#x27;s fascinating to see how Mitchriz navigates Sekiro&#x27;s world using only audio cues. (Rather conveniently, he also has an input overlay so you can see what he&#x27;s doing with his mouse and keyboard.) On sections near cliff edges, Mitchriz has to carefully count down the seconds to measure how far he&#x27;s walking in any one direction, often darting forwards to help control his movements. On some occasions Mitchriz slashes with a sword until he hits a wall, with the change in sound indicating his position. Grapple points seem to serve as useful tools for navigation, while enemy sounds and cutscenes also help telegraph his position.

                    <span>&quot;It&#x27;s exhausting, frustrating and it&#x27;s counter to the messaging they give us.&quot; That was the reaction of one Ubisoft developer to CEO Yves Guillemot&#x27;s email to staff last night.
On Wednesday, nearly 500 current and former Ubisoft employees (we understand this figure is now over 1000) across 32 studios, signed an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard staff following a recent lawsuit that called the World of Warcraft and Overwatch studio &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
The letter slammed Ubisoft leadership&#x27;s &quot;empty promises&quot; in response to allegations of &quot;systemic discrimination, harassment and bullying&quot; within the company, and proposed an industry wide collaboration to agree a set of &quot;rules and processes for handling reports of these offences&quot;.

                    <span>EA Sports has released a new trailer for FIFA 22.
It&#x27;s mostly just marketing points, but it does provide the first brief snippets of gameplay throughout that give us an idea of how the game will look on PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series consoles. 
The focal point of FIFA 22 is what EA calls HyperMotion Technology, which combines full-team mocap data and machine learning. The idea is to make player movement feel more fluid and natural. This has led to 4000 new animations in the game.

                    <span>Forza Motorsport 7 will reach &quot;End of Life status&quot; on 15th September, developer Turn 10 Studios has announced. 
That means you will no longer be able to purchase the game or its DLC from the Microsoft Store after that date, nor will it be available on Xbox Game Pass.
Existing owners will still be able to download and play the game after the date, and online services will continue to run.

                    <span>The time has come for me to find a new home for my (paper) cryptography library. It’s about 150 linear feet of books, conference proceedings, journals, and monographs — mostly from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.
My preference is that it goes to an educational institution, but will consider a corporate or personal home if that’s the only option available. If you think you can break it up and sell it, I’ll consider that as a last resort. New owner pays all packaging and shipping costs, and possibly a purchase price depending on who you are and what you want to do with the library...</span>

                    <span>New paper: “Encrypted Cloud Photo Storage Using Google Photos“:
Abstract: Cloud photo services are widely used for persistent, convenient, and often free photo storage, which is especially useful for mobile devices. As users store more and more photos in the cloud, significant privacy concerns arise because even a single compromise of a user’s credentials give attackers unfettered access to all of the user’s photos. We have created Easy Secure Photos (ESP) to enable users to protect their photos on cloud photo services such as Google Photos. ESP introduces a new client-side encryption architecture that includes a novel format-preserving image encryption algorithm, an encrypted thumbnail display mechanism, and a usable key management system. ESP encrypts image data such that the result is still a standard format image like JPEG that is compatible with cloud photo services. ESP efficiently generates and displays encrypted thumbnails for fast and easy browsing of photo galleries from trusted user devices. ESP’s key management makes it simple to authorize multiple user devices to view encrypted image content via a process similar to device pairing, but using the cloud photo service as a QR code communication channel. We have implemented ESP in a popular Android photos app for use with Google Photos and demonstrate that it is easy to use and provides encryption functionality transparently to users, maintains good interactive performance and image quality while providing strong privacy guarantees, and retains the sharing and storage benefits of Google Photos without any changes to the cloud service...</span>

With Kubernetes 1.22 due out next week, now is a great time to look back on 1.21. The release team for that version was led by Nabarun Pal from VMware.
Back in April I interviewed Nabarun on the weekly Kubernetes Podcast from Google; the latest in a series of release lead conversations that started back with 1.11, not long after the show started back in 2018.
In these interviews we learn a little about the release, but also about the process behind it, and the story behind the person chosen to lead it. Getting to know a community member is my favourite part of the show each week, and so I encourage you to subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. With a release coming next week, you can probably guess what our next topic will be!

                    <span>SkateBird, the adorable avian-themed skateboarding title from developer Glass Bottom Games, has pushed back its release by just over a month, and will now come to Xbox, Switch, PC, and Amazon Luna on 16th September.
SkateBird, which was originally due to release in August, casts players as a &quot;chill little skateboarding bird&quot; that passes the time waiting for its owner to come home from work by constructing a glorious, homemade skatepark.
In this bird-sized skateboarding paradise, players can trick and grind their way toward completing missions and unlocking courses, hopefully attracting a loyal bird following and fixing their human friend&#x27;s life along the way.

                    <span>Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine&#x27;s gorgeous sci-fi action-adventure Solar Ash finally has a release date and will be heading to PlayStation and PC on 26th October.
Announced back in 2019 under the working title Solar Ash Kingdom, Heart Machine&#x27;s latest adventure takes players to a &quot;surreal, vivid and highly stylised world filled with mystery, wild high-speed traversal, endearing characters, and massive enemy encounters&quot; as they, in the role of Voidrunner Rei, attempt to save their home planet from the Ultravoid - a massive black hole that swallows entire worlds.
In more practical terms, Solar Ash (which trades Hyper Light Drifter&#x27;s intricate top-down pixel art for a fully 3D world) is a third-person action-platformer with a focus on &quot;fluidity of movement&quot;. Players are able to quickly leap, slide, grind, and grapple across huge distances as they explore the likes of sunken cities, vast water shelves, and dangerous lava zones, battling ever-more fearsome enemies along the way.

The story of this new chapter, revealed as part of tonight&#x27;s Annapurna Interactive showcase, remains largely a mystery.
&quot;It&#x27;s going to weave directly into the existing world and narrative,&quot; creative director Alex Beachum teased. &quot;Now, if you&#x27;ve played the game, you might be wondering how. And also why. And those are very good questions.&quot;

                    <span>Developer Asobo Studio&#x27;s wonderful, rat-infested medieval stealth adventure A Plague Tale: Innocence will be free on the Epic Games Store starting next Thursday, 5th August.
A Plague Tale unfolds in a bleak, but gorgeously wrought, version of 14th century France, and follows the harrowing journey of Amicia and her sickly 5-year-old brother Hugo, the children of a nobleman, after they&#x27;re forced to flee their home in an attempt to escape the Inquisition.
What follows is a brilliantly engaging single-player adventure - primarily built around simple stealth and dual-character puzzling - that sees players evading ravenous rat hordes, English soldiers, and other perils as they traipse across the desolate, plague-ridden landscape.

                    <span>Square Enix and developer Crystal Dynamics&#x27; troubled superhero action romp Marvel&#x27;s Avengers expands next month with the long-awaited arrival of new playable hero Black Panther, coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia on 16th August.
Black Panther is the third new playable hero to be added to the game since its launch last year, and follows the arrival of two distinct Hawkeye incarnations in the form of Kate Bishop and Clint Barton. Just like his predecessors, Black Panther is a free addition to Marvel&#x27;s Avengers and will be accompanied by his own story campaign.
War for Wakanda, as the campaign is known, focusses on current Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda, King T&#x27;Challa. &quot;Blindsided by a betrayal and the resulting tragedy,&quot; teases Square Enix, &quot;T&#x27;Challa finds it difficult to entrust his duty to anyone else, even his sister Shuri... When arch-villain Klaw&#x27;s forces threaten Wakanda&#x27;s safety, T&#x27;Challa must take the fight right to them to defend everything and everyone he holds dear.&quot;

                    <span>Never mind that Ariana Grande concert. Fortnite fans are today busy mourning the lovable Bushranger, one of the game&#x27;s best-loved characters, who looks like he&#x27;s been killed off for good.
Last week&#x27;s story quest saw players aiding the anthropomorphic tree in a series of missions to raise an alien hatchling and restore peace with the invaders - all part of the game&#x27;s current UFO season storyline. 
The quest appeared to end in success - until today, when Bushranger is no longer available to find on the game&#x27;s island map as an NPC, and instead there&#x27;s a small grave marked in his usual spot with some flowers.

                    <span>Destruction AllStars has received a new patch that makes a number of significant changes to the game. 
The key change has been fixing so-called &quot;ghost hits&quot;, where players feel like they lose vehicle health for no apparent reason. This tends to happen when other players are close by but appear to not make contact. 
Developer Lucid Games believes this is caused by latency issues, and has &quot;worked on a new set of parameters between the game and the servers which should help keep everyone in sync a bit better than it had previously&quot;.

The update also adds a number of useful software features, and try a version of 3D Audio for any built-in TV speaker. According to Sony, players can measure the acoustics of their room using the DualSense microphone and choose a setting best suited to their surroundings. 
Meanwhile, changes to the PS5 software itself mean beta testers will now be able to see the PS4 and PS5 versions of the same game separately on the Home screen and Game Library, with a game&#x27;s tile labelled as the appropriate platform.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not every day a mod wins a national writing award, but the quality of the story in Skyrim mod The Forgotten City was enough to see it pick up an Australian Writers&#x27; Guild Award back in 2016. The mod was downloaded over 3m times, and it&#x27;s now taken on a new form, as the mod has been transformed into a standalone game. 
The Forgotten City released yesterday on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It&#x27;s been updated with professional voice acting, new gameplay mechanics, a new orchestral score and a significant overhaul of the original script. &quot;If you liked the mod, you&#x27;re going to love the standalone game,&quot; says the Steam description. &quot;We&#x27;ve taken the best elements of the mod, re-written the script, which is now more than twice the length of the original at 80k+ words, and added plenty of exciting new twists, endings, and surprises.&quot;
In terms of gameplay, The Forgotten City is a murder mystery game set in a cursed Roman city where &quot;if one person sins, everyone dies&quot;. Players must explore, question characters and exploit a time loop in order to solve the mystery. Combat is an option, but apparently this will only get you so far. There are moral dilemmas, multiple endings and opportunities to roleplay - all in a city filled with historically authentic Roman &quot;art, architecture, costumes and customs&quot;.

Afrasiabi&#x27;s departure had been known, though the details surrounding it - including new and disturbing details of a 2013 BlizzCon hotel room nicknamed the &quot;Cosby suite&quot; - have only now been publicly confirmed following a Kotaku report. 
In a statement issued to Kotaku last night, an Activision Blizzard spokesperson revealed an internal investigation into the &quot;Cosby Suite&quot; had taken place in June 2020, following a separate investigation of Afrasiabi. As a result, Afrasiabi was &quot;terminated... for his misconduct in his treatment of other employees&quot;.

The teen was not allowed to reboard. I can’t find any information about whether he was charged with any of those vague “terrorist threat” crimes.
It’s been a long time since we’ve had one of these sorts of overreactions.</span>

                    <span>Nearly 500 current and former Ubisoft employees have signed an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard staff following a recent lawsuit that called the World of Warcraft and Overwatch studio &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;. The letter also slams Ubisoft leadership&#x27;s &quot;empty promises&quot; in response to allegations of &quot;systemic discrimination, harassment and bullying&quot; within the company, and proposes an industry wide collaboration to agree a set of &quot;rules and processes for handling reports of these offences&quot;.
Addressing Activision Blizzard staff, the open letter, shared by Axios reporter Stephen Totilo on Twitter, begins, &quot;We hear you and want to loudly declare our solidarity with you. Over the past week, the games industry has once again been rocked by revelations that have long been known by too many of us. Revelations that a year ago many were hearing about Ubisoft.&quot;
&quot;It is clear, from the frequency of these reports,&quot; the letter continues, &quot;that there is a widespread and deeply ingrained culture of abusive behaviours within the industry. It should no longer be a surprise to anyone: employees, executives, journalists, or fans that these heinous acts are going on. It is time to stop being shocked. We must demand real steps be taken to prevent them. Those responsible must be held accountable for their actions.&quot;

                    <span>Organisers of today&#x27;s staff walkout at Activision Blizzard are pressing ahead with the protest, saying the statement released by company boss Bobby Kotick overnight &quot;fails to address critical elements at the heart of the employee concerns&quot;.
Activision Blizzard employees announced strike action last night, in protest against the company&#x27;s response to a recent lawsuit from California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing which alleged a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
Activision immediately went on the defensive, calling the lawsuit &quot;irresponsible behaviour from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State&#x27;s best businesses out of California&quot;. Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend later doubled down on the attack in an email to all employees, calling the lawsuit &quot;truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit&quot;.

                    <span>The Tokyo 2020 Olympic opening ceremony featured a suite of video game music - including tracks from Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts and Sonic the Hedgehog - but one publisher was notably missing from the lineup. Where was Nintendo? According to leaked documents, it seems that there were once plans for the publisher to be more involved with the opening ceremony, with Nintendo songs included in the soundtrack and various Mario-themed shenanigans. 
The news comes via Japanese media outlet Shukan Bunshun, which has obtained several documents for the opening ceremony ranging from April 2020 to July this year. According to these plans, the event would have featured performances inspired by the &quot;8-bit world of video games&quot; including Super Mario and Space Invaders, overseen by Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto. 
One composition plan dated 4th October 2020 featured a proposal that would have seen the return of the warp pipes from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics closing ceremony... with something of a twist. One graphic shows Lady Gaga entering a pipe, only to re-emerge as comedian Naomi Watanabe (sporting a blonde wig and red cap).

&quot;Playtonic&#x27;s tribute to Banjo is a gentle, irreverent platformer let down by spotty handling and a slight shortage of genius,&quot; Edwin wrote of Yooka-Laylee in Eurogamer&#x27;s review.

                    <span>Picross is already amazing, but what could make an amazing thing even amazing-ier? I&#x27;ll tell you what: giving it all a big &#x27;ol Master System and Mega Drive themed makeover and then hurling the whole nostalgia-tweaking package onto Switch next week, on 5th August.
Picross S Mega Drive &amp; Master System Edition (known as Picross S Genesis &amp; Master System Edition in the US for obvious reasons) is an official collaboration between Sega and developer Jupiter, the team behind the long-running, and consistently brilliant, puzzle series.
Once again, the meat of the game involves filling in little squares on a grid - using the numerical clues above and beside each column and row for pointers - until you&#x27;ve successfully managed to create a picture. This time, though, players are working toward creating final images that conjure characters from a total of 59 classic Sega games (and to musical accompaniment from each), some of which are revealed in the announcement trailer below.

                    <span>A new studio has been formed by veterans from the Santa Monica dev scene, taking in talent from Infinity Ward,, Naughty Dog and Sony Santa Monica, with a $100 million investment from South Korean publisher Smilegate helping them make an all-new single player AAA adventure. 
That&#x27;s No Moon&#x27;s new project will see Taylor Kurosaki - formerly narrative design lead at Naughty Dog and studio narrative director at Infinity Ward - as creative director, with The Last of Us&#x27; lead game designer Jacob Minkoff working as game director. 
Offices will be split between San Diego and Los Angeles, with talent from Bungie and EA also on board. Don&#x27;t expect to see what the team&#x27;s working on anytime soon, though - the announcement comes as part of a recruitment drive, with That&#x27;s No Moon looking to ramp up to 100 staff in 2022.

                    <span>Now&#x27;s the time for trumpeting console sales figures, and Xbox has a marketing statistic of its own to flex. 
Speaking last night in a company earnings call, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said Xbox Series X/S were the company&#x27;s &quot;fastest-selling consoles ever, with more consoles sold life-to-date than any previous generation&quot;.
But Microsoft again refrained from sharing its actual sales figures - something the company hasn&#x27;t made public now for many years.

                    <span>The next instalment of Hitman 3&#x27;s Seven Deadly Sins expansion has been released.
Central to the update is a brand new Escalation contract set in the Berlin nightclub map. The Lust Assignation Escalation tasks Agent 47 with collecting intel on a secret admirer. Collect the clues and observe everyone on the dancefloor to identify the secret admirer and the Pretenders. Each time you start the contract, the admirer will be randomly selected to make each playthrough different and put all of your sleuthing skills to the test.
Completing the contract rewards you with three rewards. First, the Scarlet Suit, a red snakeskin suit complemented by matching driving gloves and sunglasses. Second, the Serpent&#x27;s Bite, a remotely detonated explosive that looks like a snake. Third, the Serpent&#x27;s Tongue, a unique crossbow loaded with blinding darts.

                    <span>PlayStation 5 has now hit an impressive 10m sold, Sony has announced.
It remains the fastest-selling PlayStation ever.
The 10m sales figure was achieved on 18th July, just under a month faster than the PlayStation 4.

                    <span>Last month PUBG was given a major update with the introduction of new map Taego and a Gulag-style second chance system, but there are yet more surprises in store - with multi-care packages, a secret room and... burning planes... all being added in the latest update. 
The patch notes for update 13.1 for PC are now live, and detail changes for both Taego and the wider game. Possibly the most dramatic addition is a feature called the &quot;emergency landing plane&quot;, which will definitely keep players on their toes at the start of a match. Instead of the usual calm flight above the battlegrounds, this plane starts hurtling towards the ground - while on fire - and any players who remain on board until the end of the journey will take 50 percent damage. It travels faster than the normal plane, and has a varied fall height, so you&#x27;ll need to jump at the start of the journey if you want to glide further across the map. 
&quot;Stay alert and pay attention to the flight crew&#x27;s instructions, as not every flight is an easy one,&quot; the patch notes say. You don&#x27;t have to tell me twice.

                    <span>Glitchpunk launches on Steam in Early Access form on 11th August with its first playable city, publisher Daedalic has announced.
The top-down sci-fi action game, which has been described as a cross between Grand Theft Auto 2 and Cyberpunk, launches then with the city of New Baltia playable.
This provides around eight hours of play at launch, developer Dark Lord said, with more to come.

                    <span>The UK is a weird place, London most of all. For example, Westminster City Council spent £2m commissioning a new hill (no, I&#x27;m serious) near Marble Arch that opened on Monday. 
For the low price of £8, people with too much money to spend can climb the 25-metre-tall structure to have a prime view of, err, Oxford Street and Hyde Park, I guess. 
However, this waste of taxpayer money might just be a money-maker as a Mario-themed attraction. As Nintendo Life points out, people have been comparing the hill for its uncanny resemblance to Super Mario 64&#x27;s Bob-Omb Battlefield. Others have compared it to Minecraft or a PlayStation One game.

                    <span>Dr. Mario World will be shut down by Nintendo this November, after little more than two years of service. 
The mobile match-3 puzzler launched in July 2019 and has been kept well updated with new stages and characters. But in-game purchases have now been switched off, and the game will become completely unplayable from 1st November.
After that date, Nintendo says it will memorialise the game and your play history via &quot;Dr. Mario World Memories&quot;, a web page it will put up after pulling the game down.

&quot;Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf,&quot; Kotick said in an open letter to company staff that was made public last night.
&quot;It is imperative that we acknowledge all perspectives and experiences and respect the feelings of those who have been mistreated in any way. I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding.&quot;

                    <span>Activision Blizzard employees are planning a walkout tomorrow, 28th July, in protest against the company&#x27;s response to a recent lawsuit from California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging a &quot;frat boy&quot; work culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
Activision was quick to slam the lawsuit, strongly denying its claims and dismissing it as &quot;irresponsible behaviour from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State&#x27;s best businesses out of California&quot;.
That was a stance repeated in an email reportedly disseminated by Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend, who insisted the lawsuit &quot;presented a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old, and out of context stories&quot;. Townshead continued, &quot;Rest assured that leadership is committed to continuing to maintain a safe, fair, and inclusive workplace. We cannot let egregious actions of others, and a truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit, damage our culture of respect and equal opportunity for all employees.&quot;

                    <span>Facebook has temporarily halted sales of its Oculus Quest 2 headset as it takes steps to recall and replace the device&#x27;s foam insert following reports it has caused facial rashes and skin irritation in some customers.
&quot;As more people started using Quest 2,&quot; Facebook explained in its recall notice on the Oculus website, &quot;we received reports that a very small percentage of Quest 2 customers were experiencing skin irritation after using the Quest 2 removable foam facial interface. We&#x27;ve been working hard to address the issue, working with experts and making adjustments to our manufacturing process, and communicating proactively with regulators.&quot;
Facebook initially announced it was investigating reports of skin irritation from Quest 2 last December, and provided an update on its findings back in April.

                    <span>Monster Hunter Rise continues its schedule of crossover updates on Switch this Friday, 30th July, as Amaterasu, star of Capcom&#x27;s beloved action-adventure classic Okami, joins the game.
More specifically, Monster Hunter Rise players will be able to acquire Amaterasu in the form of a unlockable layered armour set for their Palamute, and there&#x27;s a little more to the outfit than a mere skin swap. With the Amaterasu armour equipped, Palamutes won&#x27;t just resemble the beloved Okami character, they&#x27;ll bound across the landscape leaving a trail of blooming flowers and leaves in their wake, as is befitting of a Sun Goddess.
As yet, Capcom hasn&#x27;t specified what, exactly, players will need to go up against to obtain the new layered armour set, but expect a similar format to June&#x27;s collaboration (which added a Palico skin themed around Monster Hunter Stories 2&#x27;s Felyne Tsukino), meaning players will need to farm materials from a new event quest included as part of the update.

End of Dragons is the third expansion for the long-running fantasy MMORPG. The new trailer is below:
End of Dragons is set on the lost land of Cantha, a &quot;multi-ethnic land of magic that is home to the oldest nation of humans in all of Tyria&quot;, ArenaNet said. This area was first seen in 2006&#x27;s Guild Wars Factions, but has been closed off in Guild Wars 2.

                    <span>Developer Draknek &amp; Friends&#x27; acclaimed puzzler A Monster&#x27;s Expedition is heading to Switch next Thursday, 5th August, and a &quot;major&quot; free expansion comes to all platforms the same day.
A Monster&#x27;s Expedition initially launched for Steam and Apple Arcade at the tail-end of last year, sending players on a wonderfully relaxing open-world puzzle adventure - in the role of the titular monster - that predominantly involves rolling logs around small, awkwardly shaped landmasses, Sokoban-style, to form bridges and access new islands.
A few more wrinkles are added along the way, of course, often leading to some ingenious head scratchers, but A Monster&#x27;s Expedition has such a natural charm, it never frustrates. &quot;There&#x27;s no tension, no forced direction,&quot; wrote Chris Tapsell in his Essential review last year, &quot;just curiosity and momentum and a reward that feels, at times, like a welcome embrace.&quot;

                    <span>A Bloodborne modder has finally restored the shortcut door behind the Cleric Beast, which connects Central Yharnam to the Cathedral Ward. 
For some context, one of the biggest mysteries of Bloodborne is a locked door hidden behind the Cleric Beast, the first boss you are likely to encounter. But the door is inaccessible in the final version of the game: it&#x27;s just a static door asset.
However, in the alpha demo build, it&#x27;s possible to interact with the door from the inside. The infamous Bloodborne modder Lance McDonald showed that the door was meant to lead to a pathway which served as a shortcut between Central Yharnam and the Cathedral Ward.

                    <span>Creative Assembly has announced the Mythos expansion for A Total War Saga: Troy as the game nears its Steam launch.
The strategy game came out last year as an Epic Games Store exclusive for 12 months. It was free at launch - a move that saw 7.5 million players claim a download in just 24 hours.
Back in June 2020, Creative Assembly said this exclusivity and the free giveaway was a one-off deal for Troy, and there were no plans for future games to be Epic exclusives. The deal was about reaching a new audience, which clearly worked out.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve already heard a little about new Apex Legend Seer&#x27;s abilities, but some existing characters are also getting a rejig in upcoming season Emergence, with both Caustic and Fuse due to get some buffs. 
As explained by Gamespot, Caustic&#x27;s gas will no longer deal a flat five ticks of damage per second. Instead, it will increase in damage every other second: for instance, causing 5,5,6,6,7,7 points of damage, with no limit on how much it can increase. Balancing this out, however, the gas cloud created by Caustic&#x27;s Nox Gas Grenade will disappear five seconds faster. 
Fuse is getting some even more significant (and much-needed) improvements, with his Knuckle Cluster lasting twice as long, and his Motherlode ability now highlighting enemies. Any enemy caught in the blast will be highlighted, even if they are hidden behind a building or wall.

There are no details on how big these updates may be or what features they may contain. There is no word of Brewster. But, I suppose, it is something. 
A small update arrives this Thursday, 29th July, meanwhile. This adds another smattering of seasonal items and brings back the game&#x27;s previous August fireworks.

The open letter, first reported by Bloomberg (paywall), hits out at the company&#x27;s response to the lawsuit filed last week by California&#x27;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which alleges multiple female employees were subjected to gender discrimination, sexual harassment and unequal pay.
According to CNN, this letter now has over 2000 signatories - a number that is expected to grow in the coming days.

A similar update to the game was released on Xbox Series X and S earlier this year.

                    <span>This will be Fortnite&#x27;s first big live event in quite some time - since last December&#x27;s big Marvel season finale - and, unusually, it is coming in the middle of the game&#x27;s current UFO-themed season. 
What do we expect to happen? Well, leaks and Epic&#x27;s own legal documentation have pegged an Ariana Grande concert as coming soon - though the current state of the island suggests this will somehow be wrapped into its current alien theme.

                    <span>Last month we got our first look at Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s beautiful Mexico setting, and if that video left you hungry for more, just take a look at these brand new screenshots. 
Shared in a blog post on Xbox Wire, the screenshots (and brief video clips) provide a nice look at Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s 11 &quot;distinct and unique biomes&quot;. Seasons will return with Forza Horizon 5, and each of these 11 biomes will transition through the seasons differently: spring will bring the rainy season to the farmland and jungles, for instance, while summer might bring tropical storms to the coast. All on a map that&#x27;s about one-and-a-half times the size of Forza Horizon 4. 
&quot;We knew from the beginning that we wanted this to be the biggest Forza Horizon yet. However, if we wanted to be the biggest, then we felt we also needed to offer the most diversity and contrast as well,&quot; said creative director Mike Brown.

                    <span>The makers of a 14-year-old Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas mod have pulled it offline themselves over a fear of a takedown from Take-Two.
GTA United is a mod based on San Andreas for PC. It unites the maps of Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto Vice City in one game area within San Andreas, effectively replacing San Andreas&#x27; map.
Work on the free, non-commercial mod began in 2006. The first beta of what was then known as &quot;Vice City 2 San Andreas&quot; came out in early 2007. The beta for &quot;Liberty City 2 San Andreas&quot; came out soon after. Then, in late 2007, the beta for a combined effort called GTA United was released. Five years later, in December 2012, GTA United 1.2 was released. It remained available ever since - until now.

                    <span>Pokémon Go developer Niantic is battling to overturn a wave of false account bans.
The game&#x27;s anti-cheat system appears to have incorrectly flagged numerous player accounts for using &quot;third-party applications&quot; - AKA cheating software.
Last night, after Eurogamer flagged the bans to Niantic, the developer acknowledged the problem and said it would now work to restore any affected player accounts.

                    <span>A live-action Pokémon series is in the works for Netflix.
That&#x27;s according to Variety, which reports Joe Henderson, executive producer and co-showrunner for Lucifer, is writing and producing the show.
The show will apparently be similar to the Detective Pikachu movie that was released in 2019, with a mix of live-action performances and CGI creatures.

                    <span>The open beta for Splitgate was so popular the developers have delayed the game&#x27;s launch to August.
1047 said two million people had downloaded Splitgate&#x27;s crossplay open beta in just two weeks, which caused server issues.
1047&#x27;s four engineers - out of a total team of 30 - took the game from 400 concurrent players to more than 75,000 concurrents in a matter of days, the developer said.

                    <span>Interesting research: “EvilModel: Hiding Malware Inside of Neural Network Models”.
Abstract: Delivering malware covertly and detection-evadingly is critical to advanced malware campaigns. In this paper, we present a method that delivers malware covertly and detection-evadingly through neural network models. Neural network models are poorly explainable and have a good generalization ability. By embedding malware into the neurons, malware can be delivered covertly with minor or even no impact on the performance of neural networks. Meanwhile, since the structure of the neural network models remains unchanged, they can pass the security scan of antivirus engines. Experiments show that 36.9MB of malware can be embedded into a 178MB-AlexNet model within 1% accuracy loss, and no suspicious are raised by antivirus engines in VirusTotal, which verifies the feasibility of this method. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks becomes a forwarding trend of malware. We hope this work could provide a referenceable scenario for the defense on neural network-assisted attacks...</span>

With all Kubernetes APIs, there is a process to creating, maintaining, and
ultimately deprecating them once they become GA. The networking.k8s.io API group is no
different. The upcoming Kubernetes 1.22 release will remove several deprecated APIs
that are relevant to networking:
the networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version of IngressClass
all beta versions of Ingress: extensions/v1beta1 and networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
On a v1.22 Kubernetes cluster, you&#x27;ll be able to access Ingress and IngressClass
objects through the stable (v1) APIs, but access via their beta APIs won&#x27;t be possible.
This change has been in
in discussion since
2017,
2019 with
1.16 Kubernetes API deprecations, and most recently in
KEP-1453:
Graduate Ingress API to GA.

                    <span>A Last of Us Part 2 fan has pieced together unused dialogue between Ellie and Joel where they discuss her tattoo. 
Reddit user taegukie theorises that this conversation was meant to happen in the &quot;Finding Strings&quot; flashback, where Joel talks about the Savage Starlight comic he&#x27;s been reading. 
Here&#x27;s the full transcript: Joel: &quot;So I noticed that her, uh, hologram... Map thing... It&#x27;s a moth. Was that where your tattoo came from?&quot; Ellie: &quot;Ugh... Maybe?... Judgy.&quot; Joel: &quot;I ain&#x27;t judging. Just Curious.&quot; Ellie: &quot;Liar!&quot; Joel: &quot;Well, like I said, I ain&#x27;t judging... I think the moth is pretty.&quot;

                    <span>It looks like former Stadia exclusive Submerged: Hidden Depths is coming to PC, according to a Steam page that has now popped up for the game. 
Submerged: Hidden Depths, a &quot;relaxploration adventure&quot; by Uppercut Games, was originally released on Stadia in December last year. It&#x27;s now set to make the leap over to PC, although there&#x27;s currently no release date listed on Steam. 
As you can see in the trailer above, Submerged: Hidden Depths is a &quot;non-combat third-person&quot; game set in the ruins of a sunken world. Players can sail across the ocean between ruined buildings, and climb these structures to uncover hidden relics.

                    <span>Mortal Kombat 11 has sold more than 12m copies, Warner Bros. Games has announced.
The gory fighting game hit 8m copies sold in October.
To put the 12m sales figure into context, Mortal Kombat X, which came out in April 2015, was in April 2019 NetherRealm&#x27;s best-selling game with almost 11m copies sold.

                    <span>Final Fantasy 16 is being filmed first with British English accents, producer Naoki Yoshida has said.
Square Enix has in the past prioritised Japanese for the Final Fantasy games, then dubbed them into other languages.
Speaking in a recent Japanese internet show called Washanaga (translated by Siliconera), Yoshida said the development team at Square Enix chose voice actors with English accents to play the game&#x27;s characters, and that Japanese film production will start soon.

                    <span>On 13th July, Red Dead Online received an update called Blood Money that added a number of features to the game (such as new clothing, passes and missions), but it seemingly changed something rather unexpected under the hood. The game&#x27;s horses have been acting a little strange, and in some cases, are now causing terrible accidents by colliding with players. Perhaps this is all an unofficial sequel to Spirit.  
As spotted by Kotaku, players have taken to social media to discuss the strange horse behaviour and share footage of the bugs. There are seemingly just a lot of player horses roaming through Red Dead Online, with players speculating that the horses are being left behind once players leave the lobby. Others suspect that the culprit could be a horse-cloning bug that occurs when the player enters a stable. There have even been reports of players finding AI clones of their own characters. 
In any case, the abundance of horses is causing mayhem, with players colliding with the rogue horses and being sent flying from their own saddles. Rather more tragically, some of the player horses are simply being found dead.

Once you purchase and set up an auto shop that&#x27;s now available in the update, you&#x27;ll have access to a number of contracts. In the Prison Contract, pick the Access Point mission, where you&#x27;ll be tasked with stealing a stunt ramp for a film set.

In an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, Kojima Productions&#x27; head of publishing Jay Boor said Death Stranding had performed &quot;quite well&quot;.
Death Stranding launched first on PlayStation 4 in November 2019, then came to PC in July last year. It hits PlayStation 5 in Director&#x27;s Cut form (although Hideo Kojima himself isn&#x27;t thrilled with it being called a Director&#x27;s Cut) in September.

The feature arrives as part of tomorrow&#x27;s upcoming Valhalla patch, and lets you override the game&#x27;s difficulty settings for different territories. 
As it stands, Valhalla offers a range of territories set to difficulties tied to your gear level. You&#x27;ll want better gear equipped before venturing too far into its world, though players who have completed the game have said it now lacks challenge as they continue to play.

                    <span>Ransomware isn’t new; the idea dates back to 1986 with the “Brain” computer virus. Now, it’s become the criminal business model of the internet for two reasons. The first is the realization that no one values data more than its original owner, and it makes more sense to ransom it back to them — sometimes with the added extortion of threatening to make it public — than it does to sell it to anyone else. The second is a safe way of collecting ransoms: bitcoin.
This is where the suggestion to ban cryptocurrencies as a way to “solve” ransomware comes from. Lee Reiners, executive director of the Global Financial Markets Center at Duke Law, ...</span>

                    <span>Destiny 2 developer Bungie is making changes to its transmog system.
After &quot;monitoring [players&#x27;] reception and behaviour&quot; concerning the sci-fi shooter&#x27;s divisive and time-consuming transmog system, Bungie says that from Season 15, one of the currencies used to purchase transmog bounties from Ada-1, Synthstrand, will be deprecated. Instead, you&#x27;ll be able to purchase Ada&#x27;s bounties for 10,000 Glimmer.
&quot;Since the launch of Season of the Splicer we have been monitoring reception and behaviour around our new Armor Synthesis system,&quot; the studio said in its weekly blog update. &quot;Today we&#x27;d like to review a minor update around the system&#x27;s currencies.

                    <span>Genshin Impact&#x27;s 2.1 update will reportedly introduce new island Watasumi and an all-new fishing mechanic.
Though not yet formally announced by developer miHoYo, the news comes via trusted Twitter account Genshin Report, and though we don&#x27;t know much about the new fishing mechanic - nor how Watasumi will come into play - they did also share renders of three characters already announced to be joining the roster, too: Ball, Kokomi, and Sara.
Genshin Report also teased what they believe to be a new boss called La Signora, including a sneaky, and blurry, screenshot of her in action. Take a look below:

                    <span>Sony has once again renewed the trademark for its PS3-era social space, PlayStation Home.
The filing - which was reportedly submitted on 21st July 2021, according to a Redditor who&#x27;s keeping a close eye on the situation - has secured the European trademark up until 1st October 2028. Though little else is available on the trademark application&#x27;s webpage, it&#x27;s still logged as &quot;goods and services&quot;, and categorised as &quot;computer game software&quot;.
Though there&#x27;s presently no official confirmation either way that Sony might be looking to relaunch Home - or at least some kind of version of it - it&#x27;s the third such rumour to have surfaced in as many months, leading some to think it may have something to do with &quot;a return to PSVR 2&quot; (thanks, Comic Book) that would dovetail nicely into large-scale social events, such as those we&#x27;ve seen in Fortnite. Add in VR compatibility, and it could be a very exciting development indeed.

                    <span>Motive&#x27;s Dead Space remake will reportedly include content that had been cut from the original game.
According to an IGN interview with creative director Roman Campos-Oriola, original developer Visceral Games was seemingly forced to make changes to the game&#x27;s initial plans due to &quot;technical constraints&quot;. 
Now, however, the Motive team will be using the &quot;original level design&quot;, which may give us a peek at the studio&#x27;s early plans that changed during development.

                    <span>If this screencap is real, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s upcoming Paris DLC, Siege of Paris, is set to release on 5th August.
Though not officially confirmed by developer/publisher Ubisoft, the second DLC instalment seemingly popped up on an Italian Windows store and was promptly screen-capped before the announcement was removed again.
While all we can do is chalk this up as an unsubstantiated rumour for now, the screencap - shared via CriptAssassINI (thanks, NME) - certainly looks convincing.

                    <span>Valve has clarified what the company means by describing the Steam Deck as &quot;targeting 30 FPS&quot;.
Though some prospective Steam Deckers were concerned at the use of the word &quot;targeting&quot;, Valve&#x27;s Pierre-Loup Griffais took to Twitter to emphasise that the hardware wasn&#x27;t targeting 30 FPS as much as it was suggesting 30 FPS is the minimum Steam Deck users can expect.
All the games that have been tested on Steam Deck thus far have reportedly &quot;consistently met and exceeded&quot; 30 FPS, plus there&#x27;ll also be an optional FPS limiter to enable players to choose between framerates and prolonging the mobile device&#x27;s battery life.

The browser game - released to celebrate the start of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics - has been completed in just 11 seconds (that&#x27;s In-Game Time as opposed to Real-Time Attack) not once, but three times, with speedrunners ExaminationMassive95, stratpat1964, and dishadow99 all jointly holding the record (thanks r/speedrun, via TheGamer).

                    <span>Back in the 1990s, Iraqi programmer and designer Auday Hussein worked on an Amiga adaptation of the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest surviving work of literature. He was kind enough to talk me through this amazing project earlier this year, discussing his first experiments with the MSX and Amiga, what it was like learning about programming in Baghdad during the rule of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, the challenges of visualising the Gilgamesh universe, and the possibility of releasing the partly completed game today.
Hussein also shared a video of the game, which now has the working title &quot;Kingdom of Death&quot;. It&#x27;s a beautiful and atmospheric action-adventure set in the underworld, with a wonderful monster bestiary and thoughtful puzzles tied to cuneiform inscriptions. You can read much more in the full feature, but here&#x27;s the video by itself if you&#x27;d rather cut to the chase.
An excerpt from the article, for context: &quot;It&#x27;s a 2D platform adventure with a musclebound, sword-wielding hero, a vast menagerie of monsters and intricate, cavernous environments. It takes inspiration from a multitude of non-Mesopotamian sources, including Shadow of the Beast, Zelda and David Joiner&#x27;s 1987 RPG Fairy Tale Adventure, and is &quot;more free, more open&quot; than the Gilgamesh narrative, with puzzles that pull you deeper into the setting.&quot;

                    <span>EVGA has said it will replace all failed RTX 3090s following issues relating to Amazon&#x27;s MMO, New World.
&quot;Yes, all failed 3090s are being replaced,&quot; EVGA told PC Gamer.
Amazon&#x27;s New World is a big hit on Steam, where it has seen a peak of over 190,000 concurrent players. At the time of this article&#x27;s publication, 132,246 people were playing New World on Steam.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s first bot-focused technical preview could happen as soon as next weekend, 343 has announced.
This first &quot;technical preview&quot;, which will host hundreds of thousands of Halo Insiders, focuses on arena gameplay versus bots as well as the Academy&#x27;s weapon drills.
As already announced, Halo Infinite is the franchise&#x27;s first foray into the world of multiplayer bots. 343 will use the technical previews to gather feedback on bot behaviour and online performance, and to that end will debut the Bot Arena playlist, which puts four players against four bots on arena maps. For the technical preview, the bot arena experience features Slayer across three maps: Bazaar, Recharge, and Live Fire.

                    <span>The developer of Splitgate never expected its open crossplay beta to be so popular.
The free-to-play sci-fi competitive multiplayer shooter, which has been described as &quot;Halo meets Portal&quot;, launched an open crossplay beta on 13th July. This let PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One players all play with and against each other for the first time.
Splitgate has been knocking around on PC since May 2019 with a relatively small player base, but the crossplay beta sparked an explosion of popularity (to the tune of half a million downloads) that caused severe server problems. So severe, in fact, that developer 1047 Games was forced to take the beta offline.

                    <span>A raft of Blizzard developers have taken to social media to criticise reported corporate statements issued on the recent allegations made against the company.
This week, the State of California sued Activision Blizzard over what it alleges to be a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
The lawsuit alleges a culture of &quot;constant sexual harassment&quot;, mainly at Blizzard Entertainment, the maker of World of Warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch.

                    <span>Frontier Developments has shared fresh details on its dino-park management sim sequel Jurassic World Evolution 2, talking up the likes of improved dinosaur behaviour, a new scientist role, habitant enhancements, and more in the first of a series of developer videos.
The original Jurassic World Evolution, which released in 2018, was an atmospheric, if ultimately rather shallow take on the classic theme park management sim formula, tasking players with building and maintaining their own dinosaur wonderland by laying out exhibits, tending to visitors needs, and researching new amenities - all while ensure the attractions didn&#x27;t rampage.
Frontier has already teased a few of the new features coming to Jurassic World Evolution 2 later this year, but its inaugural developer diary video goes a little deeper into some of the elements its hoping will convince punters to delve into their wallets a second time around.

                    <span>Black Book, the Slavic-folklore-inspired dark RPG adventure from developer Morteshka, now has a release date and will be coming to Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 10th August.
Morteshka - which also developed the similarly striking, Finno-Ugric-inspired The Mooseman - describes Black Book as a &quot;fusion of card-based RPGs and adventure games&quot;, playing out against a bleakly beautiful rendition of 19th century rural Eastern Europe.
Players take on the role of Vasilisa - a young witch with the ability to control demons, still reeling from the death of her betrothed - and must set out in search of the legendary Black Book, said to have the power to grant one wish to those that locate its seven seals.

                    <span>The original Max Payne was released on this date in 2001 on PC. 
It was released the following year on the Xbox and the PlayStation 2. 
To celebrate, Remedy Entertainment, the developer of the first two instalments, released an anniversary video featuring Sam Lake, the primary writer of the game and whose likeness was used for Max Payne himself, and James McCaffrey, the voice actor of Payne. The video also features the iconic black leather jacket worn by Payne.

Music from Monster Hunter, Soulcalibur, Chrono Trigger and Dragon Quest was also played. Even the recently-rebranded PES got a look-in.

                    <span>It&#x27;s a feature that Red Dead Online players have requested almost since the game&#x27;s launch, but the ability to purchase properties in Red Dead Redemption 2 - aside from the Moonshiner role - has sadly remained a distant dream. While the feature is yet to appear in the game&#x27;s online mode, modders have stepped in to finally introduce a properties system to the single-player version of the game on PC: so you can now choose your own little house on the prairie. One without Uncle constantly complaining about lumbago.
The Buyable Properties mod was released by modders Bolmin and &quot;Dick Hertz&quot; last week, and provides players with a selection of purchasable hotel rooms and cabins. It&#x27;s a mod intended for use in the game&#x27;s epilogue map, and serves as a useful way to spend all your leftover epilogue cash. You can even decorate your house with a variety of interior and exterior upgrades - check out the video below for a demonstration (but spoilers, obviously, for the end of Red Dead Redemption 2&#x27;s story):
There are three customisable houses to choose from (based in the Heartlands, near Strawberry and near Rhodes), which are marked on the map with a little &quot;house to buy&quot; sign. While you can have a nap in the houses and use some of the items stored in them, their functionality is a little limited at present - although there are apparently plans to add weapon lockers in the next update. If you want something a little fancier, there&#x27;s always the hotel room option, which this mod allows you to buy permanently.

                    <span>World of Warcraft players have staged an in-game protest following recent allegations made against developer Blizzard.
This week, the State of California sued Activision Blizzard over what it alleges to be a &quot;frat boy&quot; culture that created &quot;a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women&quot;.
The lawsuit includes a number of disturbing allegations and alleges a culture of &quot;constant sexual harassment&quot; mainly at Blizzard Entertainment, the maker of World of Warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch.

                    <span>Respawn sure seems to be busy right now - not only is it beavering away on Apex Legends (and reportedly a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order), but we&#x27;ve also heard news about a new IP - and it seems this one is going to be a single-player game. 
A number of new job listings have been posted on Respawn&#x27;s website, with creative director Mohammad Alavi describing the project as a &quot;brand new Respawn single-player adventure&quot;. Details on the game remain light, but the postings do note that the project is &quot;in its early stages&quot;, while the single-player title is apparently &quot;a designer&#x27;s dream playground with a freedom to innovate made possible by the unique universe it inhabits.&quot;
According to a tweet in April by Respawn developer Steven Kah Hien Wong, the team is building a new IP &quot;from scratch&quot;. So before you start asking about Titanfall 3 again, it seems like this is something brand new.

                    <span>It looks like a new Overwatch map was going to be revealed yesterday, before the announcement was pulled. 
In an article that&#x27;s now been taken offline, Dexerto reported that a new Deathmatch map called Malevento, based in Italy, was to be added to the Public Test Region. 
According to the article, the map &quot;features a mix of both tight corridors and more open outdoor areas, leading to a blend of close-quarters combat while still leaving the door open for the likes of Widowmaker to excel from afar&quot;.

                    <span>Fortnite has added the Ferrari 296 GTB to its battle royale island. 
The speedy new vehicle is the game&#x27;s most realistic to date, with its model taken from the car configurator software Ferrari used to design the model, and now offers to customers to customise.
Like Fortnite, this software uses Unreal Engine - so not only is this a neat addition for the game, it&#x27;s also a digital showroom for Epic Games&#x27; engine.

Last week we reported on how scalpers had taken to eBay with their £4 Steam Deck reservations, marking up the PC handheld by hundreds of pounds.
There were multiple listings of the Steam Deck on eBay, all charging more than Valve&#x27;s asking price. Some listings had the hardware up for sale for over £1000.

Several of the group, including senior producer Christopher Brock, lead mission designer Keith Schuler and art director Scott Kester, had all been with Gearbox for more than a decade, Axios reported.
Creative director Paul Sage, UX/Game Feel director Chris Strasz and lead character artist Kevin Penrod have also departed. All are intending to work together on a new indie project.

The news starkly demonstrates not only the inherent power of location data, but how the chance to wield that power has trickled down from corporations and intelligence agencies to essentially any sort of disgruntled, unscrupulous, or dangerous individual. A growing market of data brokers that collect and sell data from countless apps has made it so that anyone with a bit of cash and effort can figure out which phone in a so-called anonymized dataset belongs to a target, and abuse that information...</span>

                    <span>January 2020 saw the arrival of Blizzard&#x27;s highly anticipated Warcraft 3 remake, Reforged, but the celebratory mood quickly soured once fans realised the game failed to deliver much of what was initially promised and took away even more. Now, a report from Bloomberg has shed new light on the behind-the-scenes decision-making that lead to such a disastrous outing for one of Blizzard&#x27;s most beloved games.
When Reforged was originally announced at BlizzCon 2018, Blizzard sold it as a significant overhaul of its classic real-time strategy game. However, the final version was plagued by bugs, brought broken online play, and was absent of expected features promised in its initial reveal, including improved cutscenes and re-recorded voice overs. It even stripped out elements from the original Warcraft 3, such as leaderboards and clans.
So significant was the negative response to Reforged, Blizzard eventually implemented an on-request refund policy, but the question remained why the company thought it was even remotely acceptable to ship a product in such an shoddy state to begin with.

                    <span>Football Manager is getting women&#x27;s football in the future, developer Sports Interactive has announced.
This is not via a separate standalone Football Manager game - rather, it is via complete integration into the mainline Football Manager.
The addition of women&#x27;s football won&#x27;t make it into FM22, Sports Interactive boss Miles Jacobson told Eurogamer in an interview today. But women&#x27;s football is coming - and could be added to FM post-launch in the middle of its year-long life cycle.

                    <span>Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s producer and director Naoki Yoshida has told players they &quot;don&#x27;t need to show so much restraint [they] stop having fun&quot; following his request they make a few concessions to accomodate newcomers while Square continues to addresses server issues caused by a sudden surge in the MMO&#x27;s popularity.
A record number of players have flocked to the now-decade-old MMO in recent times (Steam saw an all-time peak of 67,019 concurrent players earlier this week), and while that&#x27;s undoubtedly boon for the long-term health of the game, the sheer number of people wanting to get involved has caused serious server congestion, resulting in lengthy queue times and players being unable to create new characters.
On Tuesday, Yoshida apologised to Final Fantasy 14 players for the ongoing technical woes, assuring them Square is doing everything it can to improve matters. A recently released patch has implemented an automatic logout for AFK players as an &quot;emergency measure to combat congestion&quot;, for instance, and login caps have been raised on North American servers.

                    <span>First it was rumoured, now it&#x27;s official: EA is giving Visceral Games&#x27; much-loved sci-fi horror classic Dead Space the remake treatment on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The original Dead Space launched back in 2008, sending players, in the role of engineer Isaac Clarke, on a terrifying journey through the shadowy interior of the mining ship USG Ishimura, its crew slaughtered by nightmarish creatures known as the necromorphs.
What followed was a deliciously atmospheric third-person horror adventure that saw players embarking on the mother of all fixer-uppers in order to reactive the ship and locate Isaac&#x27;s missing partner Nicole, engaging lasers to sever innumerable necromorph limbs along the way.

                    <span>Apex Legends&#x27; latest character Seer was introduced in a Stories from the Outlands video earlier this week, and we now know a little more about his abilities. Oh, and there&#x27;s a snazzy new video for the new season.  
During this evening&#x27;s EA Play event, game director Chad Grenier discussed Seer&#x27;s abilities, describing him as similar to Bloodhound and &quot;all about tracking enemies&quot;. Aiming down the sights will bring up a heartbeat sensor that will hint at an enemy&#x27;s location. His tactical, meanwhile, sends drones out of his chest to reveal and track an enemy&#x27;s location. Seer&#x27;s ultimate also makes use of his microdrones, using them to create a sphere that senses enemies who move through it.  
For those who are concerned Seer may be a little bit too similar to Bloodhound, Grenier assured players that the new legend is more about stealth, and is able to gather &quot;precise and lingering information&quot;.

                    <span>Codemasters has announced Grid Legends, a new racing game due out in 2022 on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.
Shown off during the EA Play event, Grid Legends has driving, as you&#x27;d expect, as well as what looks like an involved story mode. The debut trailer is below:
The story mode was shot using live action from actors such as Ncuti Gatwa (Eric Effiong in Sex Education), who could see their digital surroundings via LED screens - it&#x27;s the same tech Disney used to shoot The Mandalorian.

                    <span>Ahead of tonight&#x27;s EA Play event, details have leaked on the Battlefield 2042 mode being developed at Ripple Studios that had previously been billed as a &quot;love letter to fans&quot;, with Battlefield Portal introducing a powerful level editor that reintroduces classic maps and lets players tinker with them as they please.
The details come via a now-deleted article on Game Rant, which revealed maps from Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 3 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 will feature, alongside the armies and factions from those games and a selection of their arsenal. Players will be able to mix and match elements - so it&#x27;s possible, it&#x27;s said, to pit WW2 soldiers against Battlefield 2042&#x27;s all-new specialists. 
Players will be able to adjust settings, and there&#x27;s also mention of an in-depth logic editor which allows more granular adjustments.

Those with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 accounts will be able to claim Aloy directly through in-game mail after the 2.1 update, while other platforms will be given access following the arrival of update 2.2.

                    <span>Battlefield fans have spotted the return of a classic map buried in a teaser video that plays when players boot up one of the current Battlefield games.
YouTube creator VickeP first spotted an image in the teaser that looked awfully familiar. He captured the frames of the video that showed the clearest view of the image and stuck it into Photoshop to produce the clearest image. It showed what appears to be huts and powerlines:
He shared the image on reddit, where people noticed the image looked like Battlefield Bad Company 2&#x27;s map Valparaiso. Vicke then compared the image to gameplay footage of Valpariso and found an exact match. This really is a reflection of just how amazing the collective power of gaming communities can be.

Nope - it&#x27;s little old Stevenage.

The Prime Gaming logo will appear on the home and away kits of Stevenage FC, and the new shirts will be debuted at the club&#x27;s pre-season friendly against Crystal Palace on 23rd July.
