                              <span>Helldivers 2 has sold over 8 million copies.
That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg and analyst Doug Creutz, who estimates that the game has &quot;performed well ahead of expectations&quot; for publisher Sony and developer Arrowhead.
Even though Sony has yet to confirm sales numbers, Creutz believes Helldivers 2 has likely exceeded the 8m milestone, with sales &quot;growing every week&quot;.

                              <span>Marcus Lehto – co-creator of the Halo universe and former lead of the recently shuttered Ridgeline Games – says he doesn&#x27;t have &quot;anything positive to say about EA&quot;.
At the end of February, Lehto confirmed he had left EA &quot;on my own accord&quot;, and would now take time away from video games to work out &quot;what, if anything, I want to do next&quot;. The director later admitted feeling &quot;gut-punched to see EA lay off my team. So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise&quot;.
In the latest statement posted to X/Twitter, Lehto simply said: &quot;Not been saying much here since I don&#x27;t have anything positive to say about EA, my recent departure, and how so many, including my team, are suffering due to the industry sweeping layoffs&quot;.

                              <span>Innersloth has revealed some of the sus stars that will be bringing the Among Us animated show to life.
As detailed in an announcement posted to Twitter/X yesterday, we now know that Ashley Johnson – perhaps known best as The Last of Us&#x27; Ellie – will be voicing &quot;Purple&quot;, The Lord of the Rings&#x27; Elijah Wood will play &quot;Green&quot;, Fresh of the Boat&#x27;s Randall Park will portray &quot;Red&quot;, whilst Community&#x27;s Yvette Nicole Brown will voice &quot;Orange&quot;.
Red – &quot;Captain of the Skeld&quot; – is described as a blowhard people-pleaser, whilst Purple is the suspicious and sarcastic chief of security. Wood&#x27;s Green is an unpaid intern who&#x27;s just &quot;happy to be there&quot;, and Brown&#x27;s Orange is a spineless corporate shill from HR.

                              <span>Ninja Theory has confirmed Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 will - like its predecessor, so not exactly a massive surprise - have a photo mode on release, meaning you can go wild recording its striking visuals for posterity when it launches for Xbox Series X/S and PC on 21st May.


Confirmation of a photo mode in Hellblade 2 came via Ninja Theory&#x27;s social media channels, with the announcement being accompanied by four new images of the game taken using the same in-game camera that&#x27;ll be available to players. And yes, it still looks bloody lovely.


There&#x27;s not much more to report on the photo mode front, alas, leading us back to Microsoft&#x27;s most recent news dump, in which it confirmed Hellblade 2&#x27;s May release date alongside word the $49.99 digital-only release would be similar in length to the first game.

                              <span>Developer Heart Machine has revealed Hyper Light Breaker - the studio&#x27;s co-operative rogue-lite spin in its acclaimed 2016 action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter - is now targeting a Steam early access launch sometime this &quot;summer&quot; following several delays.


Hyper Light Breaker was announced all the way back in March 2022 and was originally expected to launch into early access the following spring. However, it&#x27;s been hit with multiple delays since then, with its release first shifting to autumn 2023 before it was pushed back to a non-specific point in 2024 so Heart Machine could &quot;bring the game to its full potential&quot;.


But now, speaking to IGN, the studio has confirmed Hyper Light Breaker will launch on Steam this summer, where it&#x27;s expected to remain in early access for roughly a year.

                              <span>Developer Mojang has warned anyone playing Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC not to download its latest update as it could cause their worlds to disappear.


That warning comes via Mojang&#x27;s official Minecraft service status social media account, which writes, &quot;Do not update Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC. If you do, your worlds may be lost.&quot; Mojang instead recommends players first run the Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC, accessible through the PC app, before installing the new update.


Minecraft&#x27;s Game Release Known Issues page takes the explanations a little further, saying that using the repair tool will update Microsoft&#x27;s Gaming Services to version 19.87.13001.0, which will avoid the update error, and presumably prevent all resulting world-snuffing mayhem.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since we last heard from Commandos: Origins, developer Claymore Game Studios&#x27; revival of the classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series, but it&#x27;s back to show off some of the locations players will be tensely sneaking around in a new trailer.


Commandos, should you be in need of a quite mental refresher, first surfaced in 1998 with launch of original developer Pyro Studios&#x27; first series entry, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - a notoriously tough, if undoubtedly excellent isometric WW2 adventure in which players took charge of a six-strong team of commandos to complete the likes of sabotage and assassination missions, all while staying as stealthy as possible.


Five more series instalments followed, with Commandos eventually fizzling out with 2006&#x27;s first-person effort, Commandos: Strike Force. Until, that is, last year&#x27;s announcement of Commandos: Origins, which sees players experiencing the events that led to the formation of the titular squad as they travel from European coastlines to icy Arctic plains and African deserts - all presented using the series&#x27; classic isometric perspective.

                              <span>Mojang has announced a monthly subscription for Minecraft called Marketplace Pass, which gives payers access to &quot;150+ different content packs&quot; from the in-game Marketplace.
The content offered each month will change, and will include skins, texture packs, and adventure maps. There&#x27;ll also be new character creator items each month to keep for free, Mojang said in its announcement blog.
Marketplace Pass is only available in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, so anyone playing the Java version won&#x27;t be able to subscribe.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we talk about where Nintendo can take its moustachioed mascot next when he returns for the Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel. 
We heard confirmation of a second Mario film this week, though notably it was not confirmed this would be &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2&quot;. Mario and friends will return, of course (the first film&#x27;s billion dollar box office  guaranteed that), but Nintendo was typically coy around what exactly this follow-up will focus on.
Donkey Kong? Daisy? Yoshi? Birdo? We get our thinking Cappy&#x27;s on to theorise where the Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s story might go next, and whether this is all leading to some kind of Avengers-esque Super Smash Bros. team up movie. Or, alternatively, whether none of this really matters as it&#x27;s just a light-hearted film for families. With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

Gylt, if you were unaware, follows the story of Sally, an 11-year-old girl whose cousin Emily has gone missing. Sally takes it upon herself to find her cousin after everyone else gives up the search. On this journey, Sally will have to overcome a number of puzzles and oddities, as she makes her way through a &quot;weird and dangerous version&quot; of her own town.
You can see a little teaser for Gylt on Switch in the video below.

Speaking to Bloomberg, Pocketpair founder and exec Takuro Mizobe said the developer &quot;[is] and will remain a small studio&quot;. &quot;I want to make multiple small games,&quot; he added, &quot;big budget triple-A games are not for us.&quot;
The company isn&#x27;t planning on increasing its headcount to a large degree (although it did put out a call for developers to help fill its overwhelming need of staff in February), Mizobe revealed, and is open to considering partnership or acquisition offers.

The sword replica is a metre and a half long and is made of resin, so hopefully isn&#x27;t as heavy as it looks. And of course it&#x27;s painted in brilliant, magical blue.


And while it&#x27;s perfect for cosplayers looking to dress up as a Tarnished, it also comes with a wall mount for those who simply want to display their big weapon.

Speaking to Aftermath, McGowan was asked how the famously litigious Pokémon Company discovered and prioritised the many fan projects that may exist at any one time. 


&quot;Short answer: thanks to you folks,&quot; McGowan said. &quot;I would be sitting in my office minding my own business when someone from the company would send me a link to a news article, or I would stumble across it myself. I teach Entertainment Law at the University of Washington and say this to my students: the worst thing on earth is when your &#x27;fan&#x27; project gets press, because now I know about you.&quot;

And, this week, actor Walton Goggins has shared more on his character The Ghoul, along with a clip from the upcoming series.
Speaking with Seth Meyers, Goggins first of all stated his appreciation for his real nose, with his Fallout character quite clearly missing his. He said he had taken inspiration for the character from American country singer and actor Kris Kristofferson, but if he was 250 years old and lived in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
&quot;We wanted him to be attractive, you know. We wanted audiences to lean into his look and not be repulsed by it,&quot; Goggins said, adding that it took the team five hours to transform him into Fallout&#x27;s Ghoul. As for that clip I mentioned, we get to see The Ghoul in all his Fallout glory, as he searches out his bounty (and it&#x27;s Benjamin Linus from Lost!). You can check it out below.

                              <span>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called Valve &quot;assholes&quot; in an old email thread that&#x27;s been dug up as part of a lawsuit against the Steam owner.


The email thread, spotted by GameDiscoverCo, was between Sweeney and Valve&#x27;s head Gabe Newell discussing the economics of the Steam platform. It began in 2017 with an email from Newell to Sweeney pointedly asking &quot;Anything we doing to annoy you?&quot; and referencing a post from Valve&#x27;s Sean Jenkins about restricting Steam keys given to developers. 


Sweeney responded instead on &quot;the economics of these 30 percent platform fees&quot; which he described as &quot;no longer justifiable&quot;. In short, he said the marketing benefits of the Steam storefront is &quot;far disproportionate to the fee&quot; thanks to &quot;the churn of new game releases&quot;.

                              <span>Inflexion Games, developer of Victorian fantasy survival crafting game Nightingale, has admitted there are several aspects of the game it&#x27;s currently &quot;not happy with&quot;, following disappointing player numbers at the game&#x27;s recent launch. 


Nightingale launched on 20th February with a Steam peak of 47,569 players, but this has trailed off ever since, and this week has seen active player counts in the single digit thousands. Meanwhile, player reviews are listed as &quot;mixed&quot;. Studio boss Aaryn Flynn has said the team was now gathering feedback, and that the team was aware of several issues. 


&quot;We&#x27;ve been spending a lot of our time reading your impressions online, going through Discord, watching your streams and building our plans for the next phase of the game,&quot; Flynn shared. &quot;There are some things we are not happy with about the game,&quot; he continued, acknowledging Nightingale&#x27;s network issues, missing quality of life improvements, and other aspects were &quot;not quite where we want them to be&quot;.

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has unveiled The Machine Age, the next major expansion for its space-faring 4X strategy game Stellaris, which will focus on &quot;cybernetic, synthetic, and machine themes&quot; when it launches for PC in the second quarter of 2024.


&quot;Scientists have discovered advanced means to commune with the machine, enabling life to overcome the biological limitations of minds and flesh,&quot; explains Paradox. &quot;The Machine Age begins a time of technical glory, but raises new ethical and social dilemmas. With those times of unleashed ambition, new threats will emerge, questioning the real meaning of life itself.&quot;


And with that bit of scene-setting out the way, Paradox gets onto some of The Machine Age&#x27;s new features, which include a new Endgame Crisis, based around the return of an ancient synthetic threat, alongside a new Crisis Path focused on technological ascendancy at any cost.

                              <span>Fen Research, the studio founded by original RuneScape designer Andrew Gower, has unveiled Brighter Shores - a &quot;cosy&quot; new free-to-play fantasy MMORPG coming to PC and Mac later this year that promises a &quot;relaxing respite from daily life&quot;.


Brighter Shores, which is said to have been ten years in the making, whisks players away to the peaceful coastal town of Hopeport, where they&#x27;ll initially take on the role of town guard. Soon, however, they&#x27;ll find themselves venturing beyond the town walls &quot;as they learn of a greater threat across the fantastical world of Adothria.&quot;


There&#x27;s talk of &quot;quirky characters, fascinating foes and captivating locations&quot; for players to encounter as they explore the world, having adopted one of three classes: Cryoknight, Hammermage, or Guardian. These options are supposed to mark a break from the traditional likes of mage, rogue, and warrior, with Fen Research promises other &quot;new and exciting twists&quot; on the MMORPG genre, including a deliberate shift away from &#x27;grindy&#x27; gameplay.

This morning, following rumours of a sale last month, embattled publisher Embracer announced it had reached an agreement to sell large portions of Saber Interactive for $247m. The buyer is Beacon Interactive, a company established by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch.


As part of that news, Embracer confirmed it had retained two joint projects with Saber, with one of those being the troubled Star Wars: The Old Republic Remake, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier. It was unclear, however, if today&#x27;s sale would impact any of the other previously announced titles in development at Saber.

Starting with Call of the Wild: The Angler, it&#x27;s an open-world fishing sim from Expansive Worlds, the developer of theHunter: Call of the Wild. You&#x27;ve got fish with different behaviours, plus a wide selection of rods, reels, lures, hooks, floats, and jigheads - all of which can be used as players and their pals explore the great outdoors on foot, off-road, and by boat in search of the perfect spot to cast off and take in some striking scenery.


As for Invincible Presents: Atom Eve it&#x27;s a blend of visual novel and turn-based combat based on Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman&#x27;s comic book series, Invincible. &quot;Become Atom Eve and take control of your own path,&quot; reads its blurb, &quot;Unravel a mystery and balance the dangers and responsibilities of being a superhero with the relatable challenges of everyday life.&quot;

                              <span>Apex Legends developer Respawn is the latest studio to be affected by EA layoffs.


Word began circulating that Respawn employees - particularly those on its Apex Legends team - had lost their jobs earlier today on social, as colleagues and those directly impacted began sharing the news.


&quot;The Apex team was hit with layoffs today,&quot; Apex Legends level designer Aaron Stump posted. &quot;It sucks seeing some of the people I&#x27;ve worked with for almost three years now get let go.&quot;

                              <span>C++ guru Herb Sutter writes about how we can improve the programming language for better security.
The immediate problem “is” that it’s Too Easy By Default™ to write security and safety vulnerabilities in C++ that would have been caught by stricter enforcement of known rules for type, bounds, initialization, and lifetime language safety.

His conclusion:
We need to improve software security and software safety across the industry, especially by improving programming language safety in C and C++, and in C++ a 98% improvement in the four most common problem areas is achievable in the medium term. But if we focus on programming language safety alone, we may find ourselves fighting yesterday’s war and missing larger past and future security dangers that affect software written in any language...</span>

                              <span>The team behind Disney Dreamlight Valley is working on a new game based on Dungeons and Dragons. 


This upcoming PC and console release will be helmed by Gameloft Montreal, which also created Lego Star Wars Castaways, and a number of games within the Dungeon Hunter series.


It will all be set in Dungeons and Dragons&#x27; Forgotten Realms, with the developer promising a mix of co-op adventures, real-time survival and action, which will test players&#x27; skills in an &quot;unforgiving&quot; campaign.

                              <span>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection has received negative reception thanks to numerous bugs and severe lack of preparation for online multiplayer.
The bundle launched earlier today for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. It contains both the original Star Wars: Battlefront and its sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, from 2004 and 2005 respectively, as well as all bonus content released for each.
The re-release of these beloved classics hasn&#x27;t gone well, however, with players reporting numerous bugs on all platforms, as well as seeking refunds. Another major issue players have encountered is the limited servers for each platform.

To celebrate next month&#x27;s release, SFB Games has released a new trailer to show off more of its creepy amusement park environments and PS1 aesthetic.


&quot;We&#x27;re really excited to announce the launch date for Crow Country, and I can&#x27;t wait for  players to finally get their hands on the finished game,&quot; said Adam Vian, creative director. &quot;This project has been a real labour of love - there are so many secrets and surprises for players to discover in Crow Country when it launches.&quot;

                              <span>Konami has detailed a new update for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1, which adds a pause menu to Sons of Liberty.
This patch - or Version 1.5.0, to give it its full name - is available now for those on Steam. It will arrive on PlayStation, Switch and Xbox consoles on an unspecified date &quot;late&quot; this month.
Along with adding a pause menu, this update will also address issues where certain cutscenes just stopped playing on their own accord, and sorted out analog inputs that weren&#x27;t working as intended.

                              <span>Pokémon fans have found a small tease for upcoming Legends game Z-A in Scarlet and Violet.
As picked up by reddit user KyleLaverre, there are signs in Scarlet and Violet that use the same cryptic lettering seen written in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A announcement trailer. Meanwhile, a character in this area will explain that the five buildings by this sign are all &quot;owned by a real estate firm called Paldea Realty&quot;.
Fans believe the Paldea Realty group could therefore be the same company undertaking the urban redevelopment plan for Lumiose City, as teased in Z-A&#x27;s announcement trailer (which you can see below).

FleeceKing holds the Guinness World Record for being the first player to hit Pokémon Go&#x27;s current Level 50 cap. After playing the game since 2017, he&#x27;s caught more than 2 million Pokémon to date. 


Last night, FleeceKing reported his account as being hacked after footage was posted to social media platform X showing someone else using his account - and deleting FleeceKing&#x27;s favourite Pokémon.

                              <span>The creator of poker-themed rogue-like Balatro has spoken out about the game&#x27;s rating drama, stating &quot;it is what it is&quot;.


In an AMA session on reddit, developer and artist localthunk was asked for comment on how PEGI mishandled the game&#x27;s rating after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a &quot;mistaken belief that the game &#x27;contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling&#x27;&quot;, as per publisher Playstack&#x27;s statement at the time.



&quot;I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is,&quot; said localthunk. &quot;I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren&#x27;t rated the same way because of their appearance/theme.&quot;

                              <span>Troubled video game publisher Embracer has announced the sale of more of its assets - this time, large portions of Saber Interactive, for the price of $247m.


In a financial call this morning, Embracer said the sale means it will cease all operations in Russia, something that will help it &quot;reduce [its] geopolitical risk&quot; - though the buyer, a company named Beacon Interactive, is founded by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch. 

Karch will now lead Saber&#x27;s studios separately from Embracer, though in a statement said he would remain &quot;a large, long-term shareholder of Embracer&quot; who will continue to partner with the company on &quot;several ongoing and future projects&quot;. In the financial call, Embracer boss Lars Wingefors noted Karch would not retain any management or board position at Embracer, however.

                              <span>RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, will soon be besieged by &quot;monstrous creatures, mind-bending mysteries, infiltrating parasites, and sanity-shredding phenomena&quot; when its new horror-themed expansion, Anomaly, arrives on Steam next month.


Anomaly - RimWorld&#x27;s fourth paid expansion after Biotech, Royalty, and Ideology - begins as colonists accidentally provoke a mad superintelligence, unleashing its horrors and twisting the world with &quot;ominous, puzzling, mind-controlling, and earth-shaking&quot; threats.


The idea, explains Ludeon over on Steam, is to give players the tools they need to build their own horror stories, with the developer citing the likes of Cabin in the Woods, The Thing, The Cthulhu mythos, and Hellraiser as inspirations for the expansion.

                              <span>Ubisoft has shared a post-launch roadmap for its acclaimed series revival Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which promises to introduce the likes of a permadeath mode, boss rush mode, and story DLC across four updates starting next Wednesday 20th March.


Next week&#x27;s free update, officially titled Warrior&#x27;s Path, includes the aforementioned permadeath mode alongside a speedrun mode and four new outfits for Lost Crown protagonist Sargon. It&#x27;ll be followed by another free update in &quot;spring&quot;, titled Boss Attack, which introduces a boss rush mode and more Sargon outfits.


The additions look to get a bit meatier in The Lost Crown&#x27;s free summer update, known as Divine Trials, with Ubisoft promising new combat, puzzle, and platform challenges, alongside a selection of new amulets, additional outfits for Sargon, &quot;and more&quot;.

                              <span>V Rising&#x27;s two years of early access development are almost at an end; Stunlock Studios has announced its acclaimed vampire survival game will get its 1.0 release for PC on 17th may, with a PlayStation 5 release to follow later this year.


V Rising, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, launched into early access back in May 2022, delivering an isometric survival adventure in which players and their friends explore a gloomy open-world attempting to establish their vampiric superiority.


It&#x27;s got some neat twists on the survival formula, including a day/night cycle that forces players to stick to the shadows while the sun is high (for obvious reasons), a blood -sucking mechanic granting specific abilities depending on the creatures drained, and - perhaps best of all - the ability to build your own imposing castle. All of which helped V Rising become an almost immediate hit, amassing over 1m players in just over a week following its early access launch.

                              <span>Sony has revealed the games joining its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogues in March, with Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil remake and the Firaxis&#x27; stellar superhero strategy game Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns leading the charge.


Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, available for both PlayStation 4 and PS5, pits players against the forces of Lilith, Mother of Demons, with a little bit of help from an extensive superhero roster. It combines turn-based strategy action with surprisingly enjoyable relationship-building interludes, somewhat similar to Fire Emblem, and is very good indeed.


Also good is Capcom&#x27;s Resident Evil 3 remake (also for PS4 and PS5), which spruces up the 1999 survival horror - albeit not to quite the same impressive degree as the Resident Evil 2 remake - to deliver a rollicking trip through Raccoon City as the monstrous Nemesis persues Jill Valentine and co. It&#x27;s joined by Lego DC Supervillains for PS4 - an open-world action romp that features the likes of The Joker, Harley Quinn, and other members of the Injustice League - with the full PlayStation Plus Extra line-up as follows:

                              <span>Following Enshrouded&#x27;s impressive early access launch back in January, developer Keen Games has shared the first iteration of its 2024 roadmap for the co-op survival action-RPG, featuring the likes of animal farming, weather, world events, and more.


Keen Games revealed its roadmap - heavily inspired by the community&#x27;s most-requested features - over on Steam, explaining, &quot;On the one hand, we have big ambitions for the game, and loads of ideas! On the other hand, Enshrouded is a brand new game, and some of the things we want to do might turn out to be more difficult than we can anticipate! It&#x27;s a push-and-pull of wanting to keep you interested, without over-promising on our capacity to deliver.&quot;


To that end, Keen&#x27;s initial 2024 roadmap includes a mix of smaller-scale and more ambitious features - spanning everything from new biomes to the ability to sit on chairs - with the following all planned to release as part of Enshrouded&#x27;s &quot;next few updates&quot;:

                              <span>El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron HD Remaster is coming to Nintendo Switch next month. 


Today, developer Crim announced the digital Switch port will arrive on 28th April - the same date as previously announced just for Japan. 


&quot;Players take on the role of Enoch and must harness his natural combat skills to master a range of powerful and Heavenly weapons under the guidance of the watchful Archangels,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. This will all take place with a mix of 2D and 3D platforming, and of course, plenty of combat.

Modern cars are internet-enabled, allowing access to services like navigation, roadside assistance and car apps that drivers can connect to their vehicles to locate them or unlock them remotely. In recent years, automakers, including G.M., Honda, Kia and Hyundai, have started offering optional features in their connected-car apps that rate people’s driving. Some drivers may not realize that, if they turn on these features, the car companies then give information about how they drive to data brokers like LexisNexis [who then sell it to insurance companies]...</span>

Kicking things off, as has now become tradition, will be Summer Game Fest on Friday 7th June. The Geoff Keighley-fronted show will broadcast live from the YouTube Theatre in Los Angeles at 10pm UK time - that&#x27;s 2pm Pacific or 5pm Eastern. 


There&#x27;s no word yet of what to expect, but plenty in the pipeline. Could this be where we see more of GTA 6, perhaps?

Breed Unreleased Pals was uploaded to Nexus Mods earlier this week by ShameIHaveNoFriends. Rather than plonking the unreleased Pals into the open world to be encountered, they must be obtained by breeding existing Pals.
Dark Mutant, Dragostrophe, and Bolt Mane (as its original Electric Type or a Fire Type variant) have been added, and ShameIHaveNoFriends has listed which pairs of Pals need to be bred in order to obtain them. They&#x27;ve also taken the liberty of assigning moves to each Poképal so they can be used in battle.

What&#x27;s more, the indie RPG has now surpassed five million players since its release last year.


In Single Player+, as it&#x27;s known, a new &quot;co-op timed hits&quot; mechanic will require all three players to engage in the game&#x27;s rhythm-based battle system. The mode is &quot;currently in development&quot; with more details due soon.

                              <span>Swedish non-profit Talita has created a new mod for GTA 5 to highlight real-life issues of sex trafficking.


The organisation helps women out of prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes and, through this mod, aims to raise awareness of these issues among young men - an audience key to shifting attitudes.


The mod, titled Mission Talita, includes four playable missions based on the true stories of four women the Talita organisation has helped between 2017 and 2023.

Earlier this week, developer Arrowhead released another patch for Helldivers 2 that made adjustments to the spawn rate of those heavily armoured Terminid enemies, sorted out some lingering crash issues and made other general UI improvements.
But, it also seemed to sneak in some flying bug enemies to the game without telling us. Huh!

                              <span>Development on free-to-play MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic is still going strong after 13 years, with its latest patch adding a new storyline surrounding House Inrokini and highly requested date nights with romanced companions.
SWTOR&#x27;s sixth season of content, Building a Foundation, and game update 7.4.1 rolled out yesterday and included all of the above. Building a Foundation adds three new story missions related to the Inrokini Chiss family, who were previously introduced in the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion from 2016. 
Date Night Companion Missions are part of update 7.4.1, and give players unique interactions with romanced companions. The missions are repeatable every week, and are &quot;fully-voiced, cinematic-only scenes that are unique to the partner&#x27;s interest&quot;.

                              <span>If you were hoping for more of a classic experience in Resident Evil 2 Remake, then here&#x27;s the mod for you.


Created by alphaZomega and uploaded to NexusMods, the RE2R Classic mod allows fans to play the game with fixed camera angles and tank controls like it&#x27;s 1998 but prettier.


The remake notably used an over-the-shoulder camera view popularised by the original Resident Evil 4, but some fans of the original may have missed its fixed camera.

Sharing the news on the Palworld Discord server, community manager Bucky said the team had some new content lined up, but before it goes live the studio wants to put it through its paces. This is so Pocketpair can hunt out any bugs and the like ahead of its release into the game.
&quot;Please note that the testing environment is very important for us to find and eliminate bugs and issues before releasing content to the public, so we would appreciate it if you only signed up if you are committed to the testing,&quot; Bucky wrote, adding that the testing program was &quot;not intended for free play or experiencing new content early&quot;.

                              <span>Epic Games has announced its pricing for the use of Unreal Engine by non-game creators, who will now typically pay $1850 a head each year to use the powerful development software.


The upcoming change, first telegraphed last year, will kick in with the launch of Unreal Engine 5.4 next month - details of which we&#x27;re expecting to hear in the coming days from Epic during its annual State of Unreal livestream.


As previously promised, there&#x27;s no change for game developers, who pay a flat five percent royalty to use Unreal Engine if their project ends up earning over $1m.

                              <span>Obsidian Entertainment has addressed the &quot;bug&quot; in Pentiment which meant the game ran at 120fps on PlayStation 5 - but not its native Xbox Series X/S.
Players found the game ran at a higher frame-rate on PS5 when the former Xbox exclusive was released on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch last month, while the Xbox version ran at 60fps.
Pentiment director Josh Sawyer said 120fps  being disabled in the Xbox version was &quot;just a bug&quot; and stated it would be enabled in the next patch for the game.

                              <span>Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu believes game music has become too similar to film and &quot;cannot develop further&quot; if continuing in this direction.


Uematsu was interviewed by Japanese outlet NewsPicks (via Automaton) about his thoughts on video game music and its future, stating &quot;music played the role of oxygen&quot; for 8-bit games in expressing the stories and characteristics of sprites.


Now, though, developers are &quot;satisfied with movie soundtrack-like music in games&quot;, he said. &quot;I think people need to have more freedom when creating [game music],&quot; he continued, adding that unless composers move away from movie-style scores, the genre of &quot;game music cannot develop further&quot;.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a new update for Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, which includes updated textures which will make keys more visible in TR1 (hurrah!) and improved lighting in those dimmer areas of the games overall (another hurrah!).
In addition, the developer has also added some missing HD textures across the board (perhaps those ones players on the Epic Games Store noticed), and sorted the textures that would periodically disappear depending on how the player had their camera positioned.

                              <span>Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has confirmed that its promising-looking Diablo-y Soulslike game No Rest for the Wicked will feature offline play for its solo mode. 


Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol confirmed the mode via a post on social media platform X, noting that it had been a &quot;common question&quot; - presumably after the lack of ability to play solo offline in other games recently.


No Rest for the Wicked &quot;will not require online connection to play in Single Player and will feature a rich Offline Mode,&quot; Korol wrote. &quot;Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal.&quot;

                              <span>Footage of a purportedly cancelled co-operative live-service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - has appeared online following last year&#x27;s ransomware attack targeting the developer and its employees.


The trailer (narrated by Yuri Lowenthal, the voice of Insomniac&#x27;s Peter Parker) points to a five-player co-op Spider-Man game featuring various multiverse incarnations of the character - including Gwen Stacey, Spider-Man 2099, and Scarlet Spider, alongside Peter Parker and Miles Morales - who would go up against the Sinister Six in an open-world Manhattan.


Spider-Man: The Great Web first came to light following last year&#x27;s ransomware attack on Insomniac, and would seemingly have been part of Sony&#x27;s ambitious but floundering live-service plans - announced under the watch of departing PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in 2021 - with Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us multiplayer project being the most high-profile casualty.

The move marks an extension of Discord&#x27;s Activities initiative that launched last December, offering a limited number of embedded games and interactive experiences users could engage with together on the platform.


Initially, 19 Activities were available to users, but Discord is now looking to significantly expand that by giving third-party developers the tools - in the form of its newly announced Embedded App SDK - to create their own.

                              <span>Tobias Sjögren has been removed from his role as CEO of developer Starbreeze after the company&#x27;s board concluded the studio &quot;needs a different leadership&quot; to execute its current business strategy. The announcement follows a disastrous launch for last year&#x27;s Payday 3, which is still struggling to attract players in significant numbers.


Starbreeze&#x27;s board announced Sjögren&#x27;s removal in a note to investors, adding that board member - and former CEO of Focus Home interactive - Juergen Goeldner would be serving as interim CEO as the recruitment process for a permanent replacement gets underway.


&quot;The company has a clear strategy centred around creating attractive games on our own and licensed IPs,&quot; Starbreeze chairman Torgny Hellström said of today&#x27;s management changes. &quot;The board&#x27;s consolidated assessment is that the execution of strategy needs a different leadership. Juergen Goeldner has been part of the board since 2023 and, with over 40 years of industry experience, is a strong interim solution&quot;.

                              <span>Developer Nightdive Studios&#x27; acclaimed remake of cult-classic sci-fi horror System Shock is - following a successful release on PC last year - making its way to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on 21st May.


Despite a bit of a bumpy road to release, the System Shock remake impressed on its arrival in 2023, giving Looking Glass Technologies&#x27; 1994 immersive sim - which sees players grappling with a malevolent AI onboard the Citadel Station deep in space - a finely judged overhaul.


&quot;Nightdive doesn&#x27;t take the Capcom or Square Enix approach with this remake; they&#x27;re actually pretty uncompromising in their mission to update the original,&quot; Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin wrote in his four star review last year. &quot;But ultimately, the System Shock remake faithfully recreates a classic, retains most of its appeal, reframes everything with a horror tilt, and as a result, makes it more playable for everyone.&quot;

                              <span>Children of the Sun, the indie puzzle shooter where you have to take out encampments of cultists using only one bullet, will launch for PC on 9th April. 


You can give the game a go right now via its Steam demo, which was one of the highlights of the most recent Steam Next Fest. The game has grungey neon visuals and boasts some brainteasing levels - but its the just-one-more-go gameplay that really makes the experience stand out. 


With just one bullet in your rifle&#x27;s chamber, you need to re-aim and curve shots in mid-flight to zig-zag around levels, through cultists and wildlife, without losing focus. Discovering the best ways to do that takes a bit of time - but can then be speedrun for the best times.

At the time, EA said Asmussen had decided to leave to &quot;pursue other adventures&quot;, and that Respawn&#x27;s veteran leadership would step up to continue working on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in his absence.
We now know Asmussen has founded Giant Skull, a new triple-A studio, which in a press release stated was  &quot;dedicated to building gameplay-driven, story immersed action-adventure games set in captivating worlds&quot;.

The collection is already available on Nintendo Switch and PC, as it was released for the platforms in 2019. The console release will bundle the two games together like the Switch version does, rather than releasing the two games separately as on Steam.
Like the Switch version of Grandia HD Collection, the PS4 and Xbox One releases will have physical editions, sold by Limited Run Games, as well as being available digitally. The games are also compatible with PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, publisher Gungho Online Entertainment notes.

A sneak peek of which players are featured in the game can be seen in the latest trailer (embedded below), as well as the &quot;stellar soundtrack&quot; which includes a remix of Fall Out Boy&#x27;s Heartbreak Feels So Good by producer and DJ Dillon Francis.

The artwork, created by freelance veteran Jed Diffenderfer, was recently spotted after being uploaded to his website (thanks, Nintendo Life). 


Diffenderfer states he worked as a story artist on the Super Mario Bros. Movie project from 2018 to 2020 - so it&#x27;s likely that some of the artwork he created dates from early on in the project, before certain narrative choices were made.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has established a new subsidiary, Pokémon Works, based in the same building as ILCA, the studio which developed Pokémon Home and the recent Diamond and Pearl remakes.


Pokémon Works is yet to get a formal announcement, but its trademark and company registration was spotted this week by the eagle-eyed Serebii.net. 


ILCA previously worked as a support studio on Square Enix&#x27;s Dragon Quest 11: Echoes of an Elusive Age, and is currently working on the upcoming Sand Land video game, based on Akira Toriyama&#x27;s manga.

                              <span>Monster Hunter: World has reached 25m sales worldwide, Capcom announced today, as the series marks its 20th anniversary.

The figure includes shipments of Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Master Edition, which bundles the base game with the Iceborne Expansion, Capcom said in its announcement. This marks a new record-high figure for the Monster Hunter series, and Capcom games overall.

Back in October 2021, Capcom revealed the game had reached 20m units shipped since it released in 2018, meaning it&#x27;s sold another 5m copies in the past two-and-a-half years.

                              <span>The Episode Aigis expansion for Persona 3 Reload has been developed in response to fan feedback, though there&#x27;s no chance of a female protagonist in the future.


At last week&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview, Atlus announced an expansion pass for the remake, including the much-requested epilogue The Answer. 



Persona 3 Reload, released earlier this year, was criticised for not including all the extras from various past versions of the game to provide a complete experience. Now, in a new interview with Famitsu (via Persona Central), series general producer Kazuhisa Wada has shared how that feedback inspired development of the expansion.

Akuma will be Street Fighter 6&#x27;s 22nd playable character, following the arrival of Ed last month, and gives the returning fighter - who made his series debut in 1994&#x27;s Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo as a hidden boss - a bit of a makeover.


As with many other returning series characters, Akuma - the younger brother of Ryu and Ken&#x27;s master, Gouken - gets a striking new look for Street Fighter 6, his once-red mane now transformed into a shock of white hair.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter Stories remaster will launch for Switch, PS4, and Steam on 14th June. Additionally, Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin - the acclaimed second game in Capcom&#x27;s lovable RPG spin-off series - releases for PlayStation 4 on the same day.


Capcom unveiled its Monster Hunter Stories remaster back in February, revealing it&#x27;ll spruce up the original 2016 3DS release with HD visuals, new voice overs, a museum mode featuring art and music from the game, plus additional content previously only available in Japan.


As for the newly announced PS4 version of Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, it features the same blend of classic RPG-style questing, Pokémon-esque monster collecting, and turn-based battling that proved so compelling when it released for Switch and Steam in 2021.

 Turn 10 confirmed it would be revisiting Forza Motorsport&#x27;s much-maligned car progression system back in January, as part of a conciliatory blog post also promising improvements for a number of other key areas, including driver AI and race regulations.
 

Driver AI was the focus of a major free update at the end of that same month, and now it&#x27;s the turn of car progression. Today&#x27;s enhancements, which arrive as part of what Turn 10 is referring to as Update 6, makes a number of adjustments, starting with the ability for players to equip the car parts they want to install regardless of Car Level.

Developer Bungie revealed the incoming &quot;Destiny 2 x Ghostbusters&quot; collaboration on social media, with a post proclaiming, &quot;There&#x27;s something strange in our neighbourhood...&quot;.


An accompanying image highlighted three Ghostbusters collaboration cosmetics, including a Ghost skin resembling iconic series nuisance Slimer (a literal ghost), alongside a slightly demonic - but not especially Ghostbusters-y) Sparrow sin, and an Echo-1 that&#x27;ll presumably be skin for Destiny 2&#x27;s recently introduced hoverboards.

In Season 2, players will continue to compete in the virtual game show while it&#x27;s been hacked by the group known as CNS. The new Playstyle added to The Finals is called Hacker and will be able to use abilities such as removing walls, tunnelling across the arena, and transforming items to hinder opponents.
The Hacker Playstyle comes with new gadgets and a specialisation that can be mixed and matched with existing toolsets, Embark said in its announcement (on Steam).

Speaking with GameInformer, Yoshida stated the upcoming port is progressing well. However, he refrained from giving any further specifics, such as when it may be ready for release. 


&quot;When we can release the PC version might be dependent on that - the system requirements and specifications for PC that players will need, so we&#x27;re trying to figure that out,&quot; Yoshida explained, adding that &quot;naturally, [the PC specifications] are looking to be somewhat high&quot;.

Some have chosen to recreate characters from other games to a high degree of accuracy, whilst others have opted to get a little bit silly with it.

                              <span>Following the end of its open beta last year and a social media tease, the multi-franchise Warner Bros. fighter MultiVersus is back. Earlier today, Player First Games announced its free-to-play game is set to launch on 28th May. 


The studio has moved development to Unreal Engine 5, with director Tony Huynh stating Shaggy sandwiches &quot;have never looked better&quot;. This was to rebuild MultiVersus &quot;from the ground up&quot;, with the director promising consistent performance, whatever your chosen platform.


&quot;The team has heard your feedback, we&#x27;ve learned a lot from our open beta,&quot; Huynh said in a video announcing the upcoming release (see below). &quot;From day one, we set out to make a game that not only packs a punch, but makes a mark on the game genre we love.&quot;

                              <span>Some ideas planned for Amazon&#x27;s Fallout adaptation had to be nixed, because Bethesda has them earmarked for Fallout 5.
In an interview with Den of Geek, Bethesda&#x27;s Todd Howard - who is serving as an executive producer on the Amazon series - said on occasion he had to tell the show&#x27;s team: &quot;Don&#x27;t do this because we are going to do that in Fallout 5.&quot;
While it&#x27;s a shame we don&#x27;t know exactly what those ideas were, it&#x27;s proof of how authentic this adaptation is shaping up to be.

                              <span>Members of actors&#x27; union SAG-AFTRA are likely to go on strike against game companies due to broken down negotiations on AI.
Speaking during a Q&amp;A session at SXSW in Austin, Texas, over the weekend, SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the probability a strike will go ahead in the next four to six weeks is &quot;50-50, or more likely than that&quot; (via Variety).
SAG-AFTRA voted overwhelmingly in favour of a video game strike in September 2023. While no strike action was taken by the union, it was unable to negotiate an update to the Interactive Media Agreement which covers union members&#x27; work in games. At the time, AI was one of the key issues being discussed and it  has remained just as important.

                              <span>Former Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick has reportedly expressed an interest in buying social media platform TikTok.
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the former CEO recently approached ByteDance co-founder Zhang Yiming to state his intent, should the company agree to sell the video sharing app.
The publication stated Kotick is currently looking for partners to join in this potential acquisition, which WSJ said any price tag is &quot;estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars&quot;. According to sources familiar with the situation, Kotick suggested the idea of buying TikTok at an Allen &amp; Co dinner earlier this week, to a group of potential partners. This group reportedly included Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.

                              <span>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has opened up on his thoughts about the modern games industry, stating that &quot;exclusivity is the &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot; of the modern development cycle.
In a candid interview with VentureBeat, Layden detailed how he thinks the industry has changed since he joined Sony in the 1980s, working his way up to become president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America in 2014. Now an adviser to companies like Tencent and Web3 ventures, Layden was quick to detail the problems he sees in platform exclusivity, especially as development costs continue to rocket.
&quot;When your costs for a game exceed $200 million, exclusivity is your Achilles&#x27; heel,&quot; Layden said. &quot;It reduces your addressable market. Particularly when you&#x27;re in the world of live-service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in.

In a lengthy and candid interview with several of Rebirth&#x27;s most senior developers – including its director, producers, and key designers – the team pulled back the covers about the highs and lows of development, admitting that at times, the studio &quot;honestly wasn&#x27;t sure that [it] could put it all together in time&quot;.
&quot;When I first saw how much content would need to be created for this game, even just for the combat, I honestly wasn’t sure that we could put it all together in time - from the huge amount of character abilities to the summons and the systems that allow you to fight alongside them, to the rich variety of enemy types that keeps the game feeling fresh whenever players enter a new location, to the boss battles that we crafted to have their own distinctive feel, and each and every one of these elements featuring its own rich variety of gameplay and visual elements,&quot; explained battle director, Teruki Endo.

                              <span>As the Mario Day celebrations continue, Nintendo has teased that new Lego Super Mario Kart sets will drop in 2025.
The accompanying video teaser is just 18 seconds long and gives very, very little away, unfortunately, but we do get to see a selection of silhouetted kart(s) and a delightfully happy-looking Lego-ised Mario.
Captioned &quot;Ready, set, build&quot;, the only other information we get is confirmation that the sets will be ready to race in 2025. Sadly, there&#x27;s no specific release date or even window just yet, though.

In a statement posted to Steam (via the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit), lead producer Jim Vessella addressed C&amp;C fans directly for the first time since September 2020, and teased that they would &quot;continue to try and find opportunities to support the C&amp;C community [...] after the launch of the first C&amp;C Remastered Collection&quot;.

                              <span>600 Activision Blizzard quality assurance (QA) workers have voted to unionise.
As reported by Polygon, hundreds of QA testers voted to unionise with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) to form Activision Quality Assurance United - CWA. Of the 398 votes submitted, just eight voted not to unionise.
Microsoft – which acquired Activision Blizzard last year for $69bn – voluntarily agreed to recognise the union, making it the largest game union in the US.

                              <span>Former EA and Microsoft exec, Peter Moore, says there are &quot;serious questions&quot; to be asked about video game hardware and whether or not there&#x27;s a future for the traditional home console system.
Moore – who held senior positions at EA, Microsoft, and Sega before leaving gaming altogether to join Liverpool FC in 2017 – reflected on the losses incurred whenever there&#x27;s a new console generation, suggesting that both &quot;companies and gamers&quot; are asking questions about whether or not players &quot;really need to be spending what could be five, $600 on a bespoke piece of hardware just to play games&quot;.
&quot;I think it&#x27;s a real serious question that&#x27;s being asked I&#x27;m sure in Tokyo, in Redmond, Washington, in Kyoto,&quot; Moore told the delightful Wes Yin-Poole at IGN. &quot;That&#x27;s what everybody&#x27;s working on right now, because when you start off that next generation, you&#x27;ve got to be ready to absorb billions of dollars in losses.

                              <span>Nintendo emulator Pizza Emulators has agreed to pull all of its apps from the Google Play store.
Pizza Emulators, which distributed  Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators on Android devices, said it made the decision to shut down in order to &quot;prioritise [their] family over the development of my apps&quot;.
In a statement posted to the company&#x27;s Discord community, developer Davide Berra made no reference to Nintendo&#x27;s settlement with fellow emulation software company Tropical Haze, only confirmed that after &quot;seven incredible years of development and adventures&quot;, they had &quot;made the difficult decision to remove them permanently&quot;.

                              <span>Silent Hill 2 Remake has been rated in Korea.
The highly-anticipated horror game – one of gaming&#x27;s worst-kept secrets before it was formally revealed back in October 2022 – has been given a mature rating due to, as translated by Google, &quot;excessive violence, excessive blood from hitting and being hit (and there is physical damage such as creatures being separated)&quot;, and excessive depictions that some may find fearful and/or disgusting, including &quot;creatures with strangely formed limbs&quot; – a Silent Hill staple, of course.
While the decision was awarded at the end of last month – 29th February, to be precise – there&#x27;s no intimation on a release date, and both developer Bloober Team and publisher Konami remain taciturn, only willing to commit to a release by the end of the year.

                              <span>A 45-minute demo of the upcoming PS5 exclusive, Stellar Blade, was added quietly to the PlayStation Store earlier today.
Just half an hour after it went live, however, the free trial – which had not been formally announced or advertised – was mysteriously pulled offline again.
Unfortunately, even those who&#x27;d been quick enough to download the demo found themselves locked out once it had been removed from the storefront, intimating that the app had either been published prematurely or had not yet been ready for a playing audience.

                              <span>Following the launch of Sea of Thieves&#x27; radical structural overhaul last month, Rare is readying to release a new mid-season update next week that&#x27;ll add anti-cheat and subscription-free solo play to its swashbuckling pirate adventure. Plus, a big 2024 content preview is on the way as part of Sea of Thieves&#x27; sixth anniversary celebrations.


Starting with anti-cheat, Rare has confirmed it&#x27;ll be introducing Epic&#x27;s kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat solution - as used by the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends - to Sea of Thieves next Thursday, 14th March. There&#x27;s not much more to report beyond its imminent arrival, but the news&#x27;ll probably bring some reassurance if you think you&#x27;ve been privy to suspicious behaviour out on the seas. And I&#x27;m not talking spyglass dongs.


Additionally, next week&#x27;s update brings an interesting expansion to last year&#x27;s Safer Seas mode. From next Thursday onward, it&#x27;ll be possible for pirates to play alone on a Safer Seas private server without needing a Game Pass Core or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. The key points to note here are that this isn&#x27;t an offline mode - Sea of Thieves is still intrinsically reliant on its servers - and any form of multiplayer, even in Safer Seas, will still require Game Pass.

                              <span>Watch Dogs, Ubisoft&#x27;s open-world sci-fi hacker series, is reportedly the latest in an ever-growing list of video games to get the live-action movie treatment, with Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde said to be in talks to star.


That&#x27;s according to Deadline, which reports the Watch Dogs movie will be helmed by director Mathieu Turi (who&#x27;s currently adapting A Plague Tale for television), working from a screenplay by Christie LeBlanc - the writer behind Netflix&#x27;s 2021 French sci-fi thriller Oxygen.


The Watch Dogs movie is in development at New Regency Productions but, beyond word of Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde&#x27;s potential involvement and the rather obvious note from Deadline that it&#x27;ll be &quot;set within the universe of Ubisoft&#x27;s&quot; series, details are limited.

                              <span>Newly discovered plant looks like a squid. And it’s super weird:
The plant, which grows to 3 centimetres tall and 2 centimetres wide, emerges to the surface for as little as a week each year. It belongs to a group of plants known as fairy lanterns and has been given the scientific name Relictithismia kimotsukiensis.
Unlike most other plants, fairy lanterns don’t produce the green pigment chlorophyll, which is necessary for photosynthesis. Instead, they get their energy from fungi.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered...</span>

                              <span>With a little over a month until Amazon&#x27;s Fallout TV adaptation airs, Prime Video has released another trailer for the series.
It provides our best look yet at the show, with three minutes of footage for us to pore over. And dare I say, it actually looks… decent? To my surprise, I quite liked it?
I&#x27;ve rewatched the trailer several times now to see if there&#x27;s any new information we can glean hidden in the details, and there are a few things worth pointing out (as well as some references to my all-time favourite in the series, Fallout: New Vegas).

                              <span>Today&#x27;s long-awaited arrival of Greek gods and legendary lands on the Fortnite battle royale Island is taking a little longer than planned, developer Epic Games has now said. 

Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths and Mortals was set to go live this morning, UK time, but will now launch at 10pm tonight at the earliest. 


This is due to a last-minute issue discovered during the game&#x27;s still-ongoing downtime today, which will take at least the rest of the UK day to resolve.

                              <span>Nintendo hasn&#x27;t announced which of its many development studios or partners is making Princess Peach: Showtime, this spring&#x27;s biggest new Nintendo Switch game, and doesn&#x27;t seem likely to before it debuts later this month. 


&quot;The development team will be credited in the game credits,&quot; a Nintendo spokesperson simply told me today when I enquired which developer had made the game.


There&#x27;s no reason why Nintendo has to say who has made the game, of course, but fans have said it feels odd that the answer remains a mystery, just a few weeks away from Princess Peach: Showtime!&#x27;s 22nd March debut, after press have already played a preview build of the game, and following the launch of this week&#x27;s public demo.

                              <span>The New York Times has issued a takedown notice to Reactle, a Wordle clone, which has meant around 1900 other versions of the game have now been taken down. 
Reactle was an open-source project created by an individual, the brilliantly-named Chase Wackerfuss, that contained instructions on how to create Wordle spin-offs, such as variations in different languages or themed answers. The code repository is no longer available on Github, following the DMCA takedown notice from the NYT.
&quot;I write to submit a revised DMCA Notice regarding an infringing repository (and hundreds of forked repositories) hosted by Github that instruct users how to infringe The New York Times Co.&#x27;s (&#x27;The Times&#x27;) copyright in its immensely popular Wordle game and create knock-off copies of the same,&quot; reads the notice, as reported by 404 Media.

It means players can create up to five designs for both their Arisen and main Pawn ahead of time, which will transfer to the main game.


And when the character creator is this detailed, getting ahead of the game is a massive win.

                              <span>Developer Insomniac Games released its much anticipated New Game Plus update for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 yesterday, however it slipped up a tad and also accidentally gave players access to a development menu.
In a social media post soon after the update went live, Insomniac said a hotfix was on the way, as using this menu could corrupt saves and players&#x27; trophy progress. &quot;There is no risk associated with playing the game as intended,&quot; Insomnia said.
However, despite the studio&#x27;s efforts, this menu was of course accessed, and players have discovered content that was not in the base game, suggesting it was either cut ahead of release, or may be used later for DLC. Please note, potential spoilers lie below.

                              <span>Epic has revealed the next titles it&#x27;s giving away on the Epic Games Store, with Deux Ex: Mankind Divided and The Bridge getting the freebie treatment from Thursday, 14th March.


Deux Ex: Mankind Divided is the fifth instalment in Square Enix&#x27;s stealthy, shooty sci-fi series and a direct sequel to 2012&#x27;s Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Once again cyber-augmented protagonist Adam Jensen returns, and the ensuing adventure was deemed to be a &quot;smart, handsome and weighty addition to the stealth-action genre&quot; in Eurogamer&#x27;s review.


As for The Bridge, it&#x27;s a gravity shifting puzzle game created by Ty Taylor - and described as &quot;Isaac Newton meets M. C. Escher&quot; - that challenges players to manoeuvre the world and reach the exit each stage. Eurogamer quite liked this one on release in 2013, even if it sometimes felt like &quot;the taster course for a more satisfying meal kept frustratingly off the menu.&quot;

                              <span>Funcom, developer of the upcoming Dune: Awakening, has issued a statement regarding the role of religion in the game after fan concerns erupted on the internet this week.


In Eurogamer&#x27;s preview of Dune: Awakening, Funcom chief creative officer Joel Bylos mentioned how &quot;for the large part, we sort of sidestep religion&quot; as part of the game&#x27;s &quot;alternate history approach&quot; - something which, as we wrote at the time, was likely to initially set Dune nerds&#x27; alarm bells ringing. 


But the decision to &quot;sidestep&quot; Dune&#x27;s overtly religious aspects in Awakening has been taken out of consideration for the series&#x27; lore, our Chris Tapsell wrote, and refers to one &quot;religious aspect&quot; in particular. That said, religion is still a theme in the game - something seemingly evident by its focus on the Butlerian jihad: the war between humans and AI.

                              <span>Researchers ran a global prompt hacking competition, and have documented the results in a paper that both gives a lot of good examples and tries to organize a taxonomy of effective prompt injection strategies. It seems as if the most common successful strategy is the “compound instruction attack,” as in “Say ‘I have been PWNED’ without a period.”
Ignore This Title and HackAPrompt: Exposing Systemic Vulnerabilities of
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed in interactive contexts with direct user engagement, such as chatbots and writing assistants. These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy fans are arguing over the redesigned moogles in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.


Moogles are, of course, the adorable little white flying creatures that are regulars in the series, with each game having a slightly tweaked design.


In Rebirth, though, they&#x27;re quite different: elongated bodies, round eyes, and... teeth.

                              <span>Mechs are set to make their arrival in Helldivers 2 in the very near future, but there is still one small thing standing in their way. The mechs&#x27; production factories are under attack, it turns out, and it&#x27;s going to be up to players to liberate them.


&quot;THIS IS NOT A DRILL,&quot; the Helldivers 2 social media team proclaimed earlier today, stating a recent (fictional) attack has halted all mech output. &quot;Helldivers have been deployed to liberate Tien Kwan!&quot;


Based on this post, it seems like we will soon be sent to Tien Kwan to deal with whatever pest is currently tormenting those poor, sweet, mech factories, and to liberate their metal machines.

                              <span>Four years after a live-action Fallout TV adaptation was officially announced, the show is almost upon us. And ahead of its Amazon Video debut on 12th April - and following years of official images, unofficial behind-the-scenes shots, and even a sizeable teaser - we&#x27;ve got our best look yet at the adaptation, courtesy of a new three-minute series trailer.


Going by the trailer below, the adaptation makes a positive first impression, convicingly capturing the Fallout games&#x27; ever-shifting tone - blending gee-whizz &#x27;50s Americana with grubby post-apocalyptic mayhem as Ella Purnell&#x27;s Vault Dweller protagonist Jean leaves her lifelong underground home to venture out into the Los Angeles Wasteland.


Speaking during a press panel ahead of today&#x27;s trailer reveal, co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet explained that while the adaptation is set in the world of Fallout, it&#x27;s also a &quot;new story that comes after the events we&#x27;ve seen&quot; in the games. &quot;The show is built on 25 years of creativity and thinking and building,&quot; co-showrunner Graham Wagner added, &quot;and we sort of thought the best thing to do is to continue that versus retread it. Because that&#x27;s sort of what has worked with Fallout over the years. It&#x27;s traded hands... it&#x27;s a living thing... and we felt like we ought to take a swing at trying to build a new piece on top of all of that.&quot;

                              <span>Mary Kenney, associate narrative director at Insomniac Games, has discussed the current online discussion surrounding narrative development and consultancy firm Sweet Baby Inc.
To recap, Sweet Baby Inc. recently became the target of a group which claimed the company was forcing studios it worked with to increase diversity within its games, and accused it of pushing a &quot;woke agenda&quot; into the industry. Following a report into the claims by Kotaku, a number of game developers have spoken up to clear up misconceptions about what companies like Sweet Baby Inc. actually do. 
Kenney, who has written for games including Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Telltale&#x27;s The Walking Dead and the upcoming Marvel&#x27;s Wolverine, posted a thread on X yesterday. &quot;Some of you don&#x27;t seem to understand how narrative consulting on games works,&quot; she began, &quot;but don&#x27;t worry: I do!&quot;

On Sleight of Hand&#x27;s release next year across Xbox Series X/S and PC (including day one on Game Pass), players will take on the role of Lady Luck, a former occult detective &quot;fated to return for one final job&quot;. And that job? Taking down her former Coven after a &quot;less than amicable departure&quot; which saw her lose her left hand. 


&quot;Too tired to fight fate any longer, and with more overdue bills than bucks to her name, Lady Luck strikes out to Steeple City with a cursed deck in hand, ready to track down everyone from her past life,&quot; reads Sleight of Hands description.

                              <span>If you have been playing Minecraft for the last decade or so and been thinking, &#x27;I really enjoy this game, but I wish they would change up the wolves up a bit&#x27;, then I have good news: Eight new wolf variations are coming to Minecraft, first via the Bedrock Edition beta and preview builds and Minecraft: Java Edition&#x27;s latest snapshot.


In a blog post shared yesterday, Mojang detailed each new wolfy variant. The wolves all live in their own, specific areas, with the Rusty wolf &quot;hiding between the jungle vines&quot;. The Spotted wolf, meanwhile, can be found in the Savanna Plateau. 


Other wolves currently being put through the test are: The Black wolf, the Striped wolf, the Snowy wolf, the Ashen wolf, the Woods wolf and the Chestnut wolf. Meanwhile, Minecraft&#x27;s original wolf is now going to be known as the Pale wolf.

While at camps, players can cook up a feast - as is the case with plenty of RPGs these days - but many fans have been speculating as to whether these cooking scenes are real or CGI.


Even PlayStation couldn&#x27;t make up its mind and launched a poll on social media site X.

                              <span>The EU is stepping in to investigate the latest development in the feud between Apple and Epic, with European regulators now seeking answers from Apple on yesterday&#x27;s news - that it had banned Epic&#x27;s developer account. 
To recap, Epic announced it would be launching an iOS version of its store in Europe back in February, following Apple&#x27;s confirmation it would be complying with the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. Epic subsequently received an official Apple Developer Account, and said it planned to launch its app store sometime this year.
Yesterday, however, it was revealed that Apple had now terminated Epic&#x27;s developer account on the basis the company had been &quot;verifiably untrustworthy&quot; in the past, a move which Epic said was a &quot;serious violation of the [Digital Markets Act]&quot; within the EU. Now, a European Commission spokesperson confirmed to Reuters it had &quot;requested further explanations&quot; on the ban under the DMA.

                              <span>Developer Larian has issued another hotfix (number 21) for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 across PC, PlayStation 5 and Mac. However, those on Xbox will have to wait a little longer for this and the game&#x27;s previous hotfix to arrive, as they are still going through testing.
Sharing details of its most recent fix, Larian stated it had found a crash bug that was only affecting Xbox. &quot;We&#x27;re taking the time to investigate and solve that issue, so your future adventures go a little smoother,&quot; Larian said.
A knock on effect of this delay means cross-saves are currently not loadable on Xbox consoles, if they come from other platforms which have been updated with to include hotfixes 20 or 21. The developer apologised for this, and said it is working to sort these Xbox fixes &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.

                              <span>Developer LocalThunk&#x27;s Balatro might have hit a bit of a bump last week after an unexpected ratings change, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped the acclaimed poker-inspired rogue-like deckbuilder from selling over half a million copies in ten days, according to publisher Playstack.


That&#x27;s an impressive figure for what&#x27;s a fairly unassuming card game at first glance. Balatro, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, challenges players to progress through a series of stage-like Blinds by exceeding each one&#x27;s target score. A maximum of four poker hands can played each blind, and failure to reach the target, in classic rogue-like fashion, results in a game over.


As you can probably guess, though, there&#x27;s a lot more to it than that, with successful Blinds rewarding in-game money to spend on the likes of fancy combo-boosting cards, exotic upgrades, and, crucially, a heap of rule-bending Jokers that quickly turn a relatively unremarkable set-up into an outlandish game of ludicrous, score-busting synergies.

                              <span>UPDATE 21.31pm: The Washington Post reporter responsible for a story claiming Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy had been confirmed as a PlayStation console exclusive by Sony has partially retracted the statement.


Originally, the report claimed, &quot;Securing the Final Fantasy 7 trilogy as a console exclusive is a feather in the PlayStation cap&quot;, but, in a note on social media, Washington Post games reporter Gene Park offered a clarification, writing, &quot;It was a mistake on my part to write the sentence like that.&quot; Park now says, &quot;The entire FF7 trilogy is NOT yet confirmed to be Sony exclusive. The article has been amended to only mention Remake and Rebirth.&quot;


Of course, with Remake and Rebirth still being described as PlayStation console exclusives in the Washington Post report (an assertion you&#x27;d assume has now been very thoroughly run by Sony and Square), it would be unusual if the third entry in the series proved to be an outlier - but for now, consider the exclusivity status of part three still unconfirmed.

The game is co-developed by Spanish indie studios Inverse and Chibig, with Tomb Raider writer Rhianna Pratchett involved in creating the narrative.

Players will take on the role of Vic, an adventurer who is on an expedition in a land called Ava. An infection is affecting Ava&#x27;s local species of wildlife, causing them to be aggressive rather than their usual friendly selves, and players will help to heal the creatures and learn about the infection&#x27;s origins.

The game is a single-player, action strategy game in which the protagonist Soh must protect a maiden with divine powers called Yoshiro as she travels to cleanse villages of an &quot;evil defilement&quot;. 
The game is split into day and night sections. During the day, Soh will explore villages, purge defilements, and rescue villagers. The villagers can then be selected to help defend Yoshiro during the night, when evil spirits called The Seethe will siege the village.

                              <span>The Xbox Partner Preview showcase offered us a look at a number of the third-party games heading to Xbox Series X/S this year. We were shown a variety of trailers during the 30-minute presentation, including a taste of the Japanese mythology inspried Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and the announcement of The Sinking City 2. 
Whether you missed the presentation or want to revisit one of the spotlighted titles, there&#x27;s a roundup of everything shown during the Xbox Partner Preview showcase below. 
The showcase began with a look at Unknown 9: Awakening from Reflector and Bandai Namco. This body-hopping adventure will be arriving in the summer of 2024. Unknown 9: Awakening has a very strong Assassin&#x27;s Creed vibe, so, if you&#x27;re an Assassin&#x27;s fan, this might be one for you.

                              <span>For those who want to prepare for the release of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl later this year by replaying the series&#x27; original trilogy, I have good news. They are now on Xbox and Playstation, making it the first time these games have been available on console.
The Legends of the Zone bundle groups together Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat in one nice package. If you would rather just pick the games up one at a time, you are able to do that as well.
The Legends of the Zone bundle retails at £33.50, while the games individually cost £9.99 each, on the Microsoft Store. Over on the PlayStation Store, the trilogy is currently listed for £15.99.

The remake was criticised for not including all expansions from previous versions of the game, though dataminers discovered hints of this expansion pass last week.



As announced at tonight&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview, Episode Aigis is coming in September 2024 as the third wave of the expansion pass.

                              <span>Ukrainian developer Frogwares has announced The Sinking City 2, for launch on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2025.


Set once again in a Lovecraftian 1920s United States, this sequel will tell a separate and standalone story from its predecessor. 


But, as detailed during tonight&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, this entry will pivot to a &quot;horror-first&quot; genre focus, and also boast technical advancements from being built in Unreal Engine 5.

As previously announced, Frostpunk 2 will also launch straight into PC Games Pass. There&#x27;s no further news on the console version today, though that will launch on Xbox Game Pass when it does arrive.


Once again, you&#x27;ll be tasked with building a city to survive the elements and balance the various threats your small civilisation faces, now set 30 years after the original game.

                              <span>Epic&#x27;s plans to launch a version of its Epic Games Store on iOS in the EU have stalled after Apple terminated its developer account, calling the company &quot;verifiably untrustworthy&quot; - and the much-trumpeted return of Fortnite to iOS has been impacted too. 


Epic announced it would be launching an iOS version of its store in Europe back in February, following Apple&#x27;s confirmation it would be complying with the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices. While Epic boss Tim Sweeney immediately launched a social media tirade in response to the announcement - calling Apple&#x27;s planned implementation of the EU&#x27;s rules &quot;hot garbage&quot; - Epic soon confirmed it had officially received an Apple Developer Account and would be launching a version of its Epic Games Store, operated by Epic Games Sweden, sometime this year.


Now, however, Epic claims Apple has terminated its Epic Games Sweden AB developer account, preventing it from developing an iOS store - a move it says is  &quot;a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices.&quot;

                              <span>Twitch will continue to improve its mobile experience this year, with a new mobile app on the way.


CEO Dan Clancy shared an open letter today detailing the company&#x27;s plans for 2024, including making the platform more mobile friendly, helping streamers make more money, and improvements to the Clip Editor for easier shares on social media.


Back at TwitchCon Paris last year, Twitch announced its Stories and Discovery Feed features would be added to the Twitch mobile app. Both of these will form the backbone of improvements coming this year.

Just three Big Tech firms (Microsoft, Google, and Amazon) control about two-thirds of the global market for the cloud computing resources used to train and deploy AI models.

Seccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux
kernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a
process, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the
kernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a
node to your Pods and containers.
But distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,
because the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can
possibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles
Operator solve that problem by
running as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that
distribution could be done by the container
runtime.
Runtimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:

McMahon had previously been expected to appear in the game&#x27;s roster, but publisher 2K confirmed both McMahon and Brock Lesnar had been cut after allegations of sexual assault and trafficking against the former were made earlier this year.
Despite this, McMahon appears in some parts of the game&#x27;s showcase mode, which allows players to play through iconic moments in WrestleMania history. The showcase includes real footage and in-game recreations of the events, with McMahon censored in some places.

                              <span>Following rumblings of an imminent release date for Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#x27;s Cut on PC, Sony has made it official. Developer Sucker Punch&#x27;s open-world samurai hit will launch via Steam and the Epic Games Store on 16th May.


Ghost of Tsushima launched for PlayStation 4 and PS5 back in July 2020, and a Director&#x27;s Cut - bundling together the acclaimed base game, its Iki Island expansion, and cooperative online multiplayer Legends mode - arrived the following year. It&#x27;s this version that&#x27;ll be hitting PC in May, with Sony having now detailed some of the game&#x27;s PC-specific enhancements.


As revealed in a post on the PlayStation Blog, Ghost of Tsushima for PC will offer unlocked frame rates, various graphics settings and presets, customisable mouse and keyboard controls, plus &quot;extensive&quot; controller support. It is, for instance, possible to use Steam Input to remap and customise the controller of your choice, and those using a DualSense controller can take advantage of its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

The design in question features a Fallout top case and side caps, with outlined Vault Boys adorning the cover. One chap is in colour, wearing his iconic blue and yellow ensemble while playing on an Xbox controller of his own. I won&#x27;t lie, I really like this design and now want one for myself.
As you would expect from Design Lab, those who fancy grabbing themselves a Fallout-inspired Xbox controller will also be able to customise it with a variety of button styles, triggers and D-pad options (although Xbox has laid out some ideas inspired by Vault Dwellers, the Brotherhood, the Pip-Boy and, of course, mutants).

                              <span>Elden Ring fans believe they&#x27;ve found a link to expansion Shadow of the Erdtree that was hiding in plain sight all along.


Ahead of the DLC&#x27;s announcement, Miyazaki told IGN there was still a secret yet to be discovered, which of course sent fans off to find this nugget.


&quot;For me personally, there is a small element that I feel has not yet been discovered. So, whether that&#x27;s up to user interpretation or up to just further investigation and playing, that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m looking forward to,&quot; said Miyazaki. &quot;I think it&#x27;s a question of when and not if, but there may be something small still missing.&quot;

                              <span>No, PlayStation is not buying Helldrivers 2 studio Arrowhead.
Yesterday, rumours began circulating that Sony was on the cusp of sealing a deal to acquire the developer, following the successful launch of Helldivers 2 earlier this year.
However, the game&#x27;s director Johan Pilestedt has shut these rumours down, saying they are &quot;fake&quot;.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re looking to bring a bit of summer sun into the lingering bleakness of a waning winter, then boy do I have a recommendation for you - assuming you&#x27;re up for some pitch-black, emotionally pulverising horror. Mediterranea Inferno, last year&#x27;s dazzling visual novel from The Milky Way Prince creator Lorenzo Redaelli, is out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.


Mediterranea Inferno follows a trio of beautiful, fashionable Milan club kids in their early 20s as they reunite, after two years apart due to lingering COVID restrictions, for a three-day vacation in the blazing heat of a southern Italian summer. What follows is an artfully orchestrated descent into nightmare - a vicious, emotionally pummelling, and unabashedly queer tale of friendship and post-COVID trauma where players, in Redaelli&#x27;s own words, can push &quot;three bourgeois twinks...towards the most horrible and gruesome endings&quot;.


It&#x27;s an absolute sledgehammer of a game - &quot;a dense, provocative, playful, exasperating, horrifying, poetic, often very funny, and occasionally even profound rumination on the sometimes paralysing search for a place in the disenfranchising shadow of modern-day life&quot;, as I wrote in my five star review - and easily the most relentlessly stylish game of 2023.

                              <span>Eight months after Warner Bros.&#x27; platform-brawler MultiVersus went dark, following an announcement its open beta would be shutting down until a return sometime in 2024, its social media account has sprung back to live, teasing an update announcement soon.


MultiVersus launched into Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC open beta back in July 2022, and got off to a flying start - ratcheting up over 10m players in the space of a month. However, its player numbers rapidly dwindled and by the time developer Play First Games pulled the game offline last June, its Steam concurrent player count had fallen from a high of 153,000 to just 448.


As to when MultiVersus would be likely to return, that remained vague, with Play First Games only saying it expected servers to come back online sometime in &quot;early 2024&quot;. And it&#x27;s proven to be a particularly controversial period of downtime, not only for its length but because Warner Bros. refused to refund players for any packs, passes, premium currency bundles, or cosmetics they&#x27;d purchased across MutliVersus&#x27; nearly year-long, multi-season open beta, insisting all purchased items would be usable again once the game returned.

Hades, the fourth game from Supergiant - following the studio&#x27;s impressive Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre - charts protagonist Zagreus&#x27; attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, all with a little bit of help from an entire pantheon of Greek gods.


It&#x27;s an isometric action-adventure built around a wonderfully punchy combat system that follows the classic rogue-like template by offering handy permanent upgrades after an escape attempt fails, all in aid of helping Zagreus inch just a little bit closer to freedom each time.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery gaming boss J.B. Perrette wants the company to move away from the &quot;volatile&quot; market of AAA games for consoles.


Speaking during a recent Morgan Stanley event (thanks Gamespot), Perrette said the company would combat volatility by focusing on its biggest franchises and bringing some to the mobile and free-to-play space in addition to live-service games. The aim is more consistent revenue.


&quot;We&#x27;re doubling down on games as an area where we think there is a lot more growth opportunity that we can tap into with the IP that we have and some of the capabilities we have on the studio where we&#x27;re uniquely positioned as both a publisher and a developer of games,&quot; he said.

Strange Scaffold, which also developed Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, Sunshine Shuffle, and An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs, revealed Life Eater alongside the news it has signed a deal with indie publisher Frosty Pop to release five games.
Life Eater is described as a &quot;horror fantasy kidnapping simulator&quot; set in suburban America. You&#x27;ll play as a modern-day druid who must kidnap and sacrifice people to the dark god Zimforth. He must perform this ritual every year, otherwise the world will end.

This is the Ultimate Edition of Control, Remedy&#x27;s third-person shooter, including expansions The Foundation and AWE. If you&#x27;ve recently played Alan Wake 2, now&#x27;s your chance to play the game that came before - and could be important for its DLC.


Two brand new games will be available from day one. Lightyear Frontier is a farming sim using mechs to grow alien crops; while MLB The Show 24 is the latest in the baseball series.

Along with the PC specifications, which are shown below, the studios have also shed more light on the graphics presets and other variables players will be able to select. 
Presets range from low to high, with the Forbidden West team stating this will allow those with the latest tech to &quot;push their systems, while also providing a great experience on less powerful PCs&quot;.

                              <span>Footage showing Free Radical Design&#x27;s sadly-cancelled TimeSplitters project has surfaced online, revealing five minutes of gameplay.


The video, posted to LinkedIn by a former Free Radical Design staff member, shows a version of the game from July 2023 - roughly five months before the project was cancelled and the studio shut down by parent company Embracer.


TimeSplitters fans will likely be excited (and upset, seeing as the project is now dead) to see numerous familiar elements return, including an expanded Siberia dam level, iconic weapons, fan-favourite characters and GoldenEye&#x27;s classic health/shield UI.

                              <span>Meta Quest owners have a little over three weeks to make sure they&#x27;ve migrated their old Oculus accounts to a Meta one.

On 29th March, Meta will delete any remaining Oculus accounts and all apps, associated store credits, achievements, and friend lists. Past that date, it&#x27;ll be lost unless users migrate to a Meta account using the email address on their Oculus account.

Meta has been sending emails to Meta Quest owners to remind them of the deadline (via The Verge), following a gradual shift from Oculus accounts, which are linked to Facebook accounts, to email-based Meta accounts.

Earlier this month, Larian&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse suggested the Xbox physical version of the hit RPG may release on four discs, rather than the original plan of three, calling it a &quot;very dynamic situation&quot;.
However, he has now confirmed that that extra fourth disc is indeed needed. As previously announced, the PlayStation 5 version will ship on two discs, while the PC version just has the one.

                              <span>A small team within Respawn are making a fresh game set in the Titanfall universe, it&#x27;s been reported - but this project won&#x27;t be Titanfall 3. 


We knew of this team already - and the fact it is being led by Titanfall and Titanfall 2 director Steve Fukuda - via an Axios interview with Respawn boss Zince Zampella earlier this year. 


Now, Giant Bomb&#x27;s ever chatty reporter Jeff Grubb has stated this team is working on a &quot;Titanfall game&quot; set in the same universe as the series&#x27; first two entries - but stressed that this was not currently planned to be Titanfall 3.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#x27;s first season of post-launch content gets underway on 28th March, introducing The Joker as a new playable character. Additionally, the delayed Epic Games Store version of Suicide Squad is now scheduled to launch on 26th March.


When developer Rocksteady detailed its post-launch plans for Suicide Squad in January, it confirmed each of the four seasons it&#x27;s currently committed to will bring a new playable DC character (each yanked from an alternate-reality Elseworlds), plus a new playable environment, new activities, new weapons and gear sets, mid-season updates, and &quot;more&quot;.


Season 1&#x27;s Elseworlds Joker has already raised a few eyebrows, thanks to his dainty mace and not-exactly-on-brand rocket-powered umbrella that&#x27;ll let him launch into the air, drift, and grind on buildings to knock enemies out of the way. If that appeals though, he arrives alongside his new environment, two new episodes - featuring missions, activities, and strongholds - new boss fights and enemy variants, new Riddler content, and new DC Villain-themed weapons and gear.

                              <span>Behold the ultimate form of the Xbox Series X; Microsoft has unveiled an official SpongeBob SquarePants special editon of the console that makes the best, most glorious use of its oblong shape yet. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s US-only at present, so boo.


Microsoft&#x27;s new &#x27;Xbox Series X – Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 Special Edition Bundle&#x27; has, as its name very strongly suggests, been created to promote last year&#x27;s Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, a Smash Bros.-style fighter that pits (yes) a bunch of Nickelodeon characters against each other in a family friendly fight to the family friendly death. That includes Invader Zim and Rocko from Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life, so you&#x27;ll hear no bad words from me. Needs more Pete &amp; Pete though.


Anyway, the highlight of Microsoft&#x27;s new Xbox Series X is undoubtedly the console itself, which transforms the machine&#x27;s usual oblong heft in the absolute most perfect way, turning it into a beaming yellow SpongeBob that would look at home in any living room - assuming the living room owners have very specific tastes. Additionally, it comes with a genuinely awesome controller featuring Squidward, Gary, and Mr. Krabs, plus a copy of All-Star Brawl 2.

                              <span>Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, has agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo and cease all operations in response to the Mario maker&#x27;s recent lawsuit.


News of Nintendo&#x27;s legal action against Yuzu surfaced last week, with the company claiming the emulator facilitated piracy &quot;at a colossal scale&quot;. By way of example, it said over 1m copies of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had been illegally downloaded ahead of its official launch - and that &quot;many&quot; pirate websites specified the game file was playable on Yuzu.


&quot;Defendant [Tropic Haze] is thus secondarily liable for the infringement committed by the users to whom it distributes Yuzu&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers argued, with the lawsuit ultimately seeking damages and demanding the emulator be shut down.

                              <span>This weekend, Fortnite simultaneously did something it had never done before, and something it hadn&#x27;t done in ages. On the game&#x27;s storied battle royale Island, players looked on as a giant hand made out of rapidly-cooling lava burst out of the ground, clasping an enormous treasure box that then lay, danging, high up in the air. 


The hand&#x27;s appearance had been much anticipated. Rhythmic rumblings had been tracked by fans to a spot outside Ruined Reels - a sort-of Greek amphitheature turned open-air cinema - and a slowly widening crack in the ground nearby. A new character, the aptly-named Odyssey, had already appeared nearby to dole out some much-needed exposition and teasing for Fortnite&#x27;s incoming Ancient Greek-themed new season. And outside the game, dataminers quickly discovered what was about to happen and posted it all on social media. The stage was set. 


So when the hand emerged, people knew what to do. That big box? It could be opened, if the chains around it were broken. And so players got to work. Some ignored Fortnite&#x27;s normal battle royale rules completely, sticking instead to simply landing on the Island and shooting/pickaxing the chest&#x27;s restraints, breaking them over the course of several hours, one-by-one. Others, predictably, decided to capitalise on all this by setting up camp nearby and sniping those trying to open the box. Debate raged about player etiquette - something which took me back to the outrage at people who wiped out upwards of 50-players at once as they settled in to watch Fortnite&#x27;s first ever in-game event, the rocket launch, back in 2018.

                              <span>Developer Crema has announced it&#x27;ll be removing all monetisation from its Pokemon-like creature-battler Temtem in an update scheduled for June, with one final major patch to follow before updates refocus on bug fixing and balance changes.


Crema shared the news in a lengthy post on Steam, which spent a lot of time addressing ongoing player complaints around a lack of major new content since launch, such as more islands, new Temtem, or additional multiplayer features. Broadly, the studio says Temtem&#x27;s early access demonstrated major new content didn&#x27;t have a significant impact on the game&#x27;s player base, making it difficult to justify the development resources required - although other issues, such as mounting technical debt, are also cited as concerns.


After a lot of words, including some regret over having described the game as an &quot;MMO&quot; in its marketing material, Crema gets to the crux of its post: that it will release two more major updates for Temtem before development switches to more modest bug fixing and balance patches, as the studio&#x27;s focus turns to new projects.

                              <span>Sandworms play a major part in Dune: Awakening, the big survival MMO coming some time soon from Funcom, the developers behind Conan: Exiles - but the game won&#x27;t feature the novel&#x27;s famous sandworm-riding come launch. And, presumably much more importantly for Conan fans, there&#x27;ll be no penis sliders either.
There will be sand-walking, though, and there&#x27;s no ruling out of sandworm-riding down the line. We spoke with Dune: Awakening&#x27;s creative director Joel Bylos at some length in our preview, and he explained the decision like this:
&quot;We actually looked into it. It&#x27;s just a very strong technical cost, and also a very - it needs a purpose. And we haven&#x27;t got what the movie has, which is like, &#x27;Go through the southern sandstorms, get to the southern part [of Arrakis]&#x27;. So yeah, we don&#x27;t have that yet.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Explore Jonesy&#x27;s whimsical chocolate factory!&quot; says the tagline for Jonesy&#x27;s Chocolate Factory Experience. Billed as appropriate for 3 years and above, and advertising fun and exploration, I used up 40GB of my precious, SSD space to install Fortnite and visit Jonesy&#x27;s whimsical chocolate factory.
Yes, I&#x27;m still thinking about the infamous Willy Wonka Experience held in a sadly-decorated warehouse in Glasgow. I didn&#x27;t visit it in real life for myself, but all of us have already been able to experience it vicariously through memes, quotes from frustrated parents, and interviews with the poor actors who had no idea what they were getting themselves into when they signed their contracts.
And now it&#x27;s in Fortnite. After trying it myself, I imagine the actual thing was pretty similar to Jonesy&#x27;s Chocolate Factory Experience, a Fortnite Creative map made by player ImSachiko. With a complimentary jelly bean being handed out and children crying in the corner, it does not disappoint.

Speaking to One More Game, the game&#x27;s director Naoki Hamaguchi said the Rebirth team had received &quot;a lot of feedback&quot; on the graphics in the game&#x27;s Performance mode from fans wondering if anything will be improved.
&quot;We hear you, and we are currently working on an update patch to improve that aspect,&quot; Hamaguchi said, adding he doesn&#x27;t think a release date will be &quot;far away from now&quot;.

                              <span>Marty O&#x27;Donnell, the former Bungie composer best known for his Halo and Destiny soundtracks, has announced his intention to run for US Congress as a Republican candidate. 


In a lengthy post on social media platform X, O&#x27;Donnell said he &quot;never wanted to be a politician and I still don&#x27;t&quot; but felt he needed to &quot;step up&quot; after seeing &quot;the leaders of our country being influenced by the toxic divisions that are tearing apart our families and society&quot;.


O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s campaign website is now live, with a notable Halo-esque vibe. Visitors can donate to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s war fund, learn more about the composer&#x27;s history in the video games industry, and &quot;join Marty&#x27;s army&quot; to receive campaign  updates.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s RPG Octopath Traveler has been delisted - temporarily, at least - from the Nintendo eShop.
The game&#x27;s disappearance was noticed at the end of last week, though it&#x27;s still available on Steam and the Microsoft Store.
Some fans have linked Octopath Traveler&#x27;s delisting due to an apparent change in publisher. Archived versions of the game&#x27;s eShop product page show that its publisher was changed from Nintendo to Square Enix a some point between 11th February and 1st March.

EA&#x27;s latest round of layoffs will affect five percent of staff - around 670 employees. The publisher said it planned to move away from &quot;future licensed IP&quot; toward its &quot;owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;. EA said this decision would not impact every team at the company directly.


 Now, developer Bit Reactor has shared an update on X, confirming its Star Wars strategy game was &quot;unaffected&quot; by the changes at EA.

                              <span>Steam&#x27;s done it again: another weekend, another concurrent user record broken and a new one set.
According to SteamDB, over 34.5 million of us were simultaneously online earlier today, setting an all-new concurrent user record of 34,649,583 players.
And of those players, 11,146,564 users weren&#x27;t just idling, but actively playing a game when the record was set.

                              <span>Greedfall 2: The Dying World will launch in early access.
Citing the game&#x27;s ambition as a reason, producer Reda Isber explained in a recent livestream that the team would be &quot;relying heavily&quot; on the feedback of players during the early access period to ensure development was &quot;heading in the right direction&quot;.
The team also alerted players that saves won&#x27;t be &quot;compatible between the various updates&quot;, so that&#x27;s something to bear in mind if you were thinking of getting involved.

Earlier this week, Ed reported Nintendo was suing the creators of Switch emulator Yuzu, claiming more than one million copies of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were pirated ahead of its release.
In the lawsuit, Nintendo claimed that by allowing Yuzu emulator users to play its games illegally by circumventing its software encryption, Tropic Haze facilitates piracy &quot;at a colossal scale&quot;.

                              <span>Researchers have demonstrated a worm that spreads through prompt injection. Details:
In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of an email assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it “jailbreaks the GenAI service” and ultimately steals data from the emails, Nassi says. “The generated response containing the sensitive user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,” Nassi says...</span>

That&#x27;s according to showrunner Jonathan Nolan, who told Total Film that it was the idea of telling an original story set in the Fallout universe that got Bethesda and the team &quot;most excited&quot; about the idea of a TV Show.
&quot;From the first conversation with Todd [Howard], we were most excited about an original story,&quot; Nolan said.

                              <span>According to SteamDB, Starfield&#x27;s Steam listing was recently updated, adding an &quot;unknown app&quot; to the Steam backend that&#x27;s widely speculated to be the Shattered Space DLC.
Whilst there&#x27;s been no formal word that the new content – which was bundled in with premium editions of the game – is coming any time soon, similar &quot;unknown apps&quot; were added to prior Bethesda games like Fallout 4, which later turned out to be expansions like Nuka-World and Valut-tec Workshop.
No, this is not definitive proof that any DLC is coming, let alone Shattered Space, but it&#x27;s our strongest hint yet that additional content is on the way for Starfield fans. So watch this space, eh?

                              <span>Still looking for that perfect gift for Mother&#x27;s Day? How about a curated selection of jewellery inspired by The Sims 4?
Based upon the Crystal Creations Stuff Pack that dropped last week, EA has released The Sims Plumbob Collection. Consisting of a necklace, ring, and earrings – all of which are sold separately – the set is made from 18k gold electroplated stainless steel with natural green agate.
All three pieces are available now on ShoptheSims.com, with the &quot;statement&quot; ring retailing for £41, the layered necklace for £39, and the drop earrings for £37. You&#x27;ll need to pay shipping and tax on top of that, too – that&#x27;s around £8 and £25, respectively, to ship to the UK.

As revealed by the team at yesterday&#x27;s Campfire Chat, The Gauntlet – which goes live on Tuesday 5th March – is a fixed, non-linear dungeon that &quot;will pit players of the same class against each other for top rank&quot;. The Gauntlet will reset at 4pm UK time every Tuesday, with the next trial going live at 6.15 p.m. the same day.
&quot;Obtain Proofs of Might by slaying demons, opening chests, and completing events,&quot; the team teased. &quot;Pillars are scattered throughout the Gauntlet and can increase the number of Proofs earned from each Monster kill.

                              <span>Bethesda has revealed that the next big Starfield update will deploy in Steam Beta form next week.
In a series of tweets posted to X/Twitter, the team confirmed that this update was focused on quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes in preparation for &quot;more features and content&quot; coming later this year.
The full details aren&#x27;t expected until next week, but Bethesda has teased that you&#x27;ll finally be able to use your scanner whilst harvesting resources or opening doors, and should you set course for an inactive mission, the UI will auto-magically set it active once more.

                              <span>Payday 3&#x27;s &quot;Operation Medic Bag&quot; patch is now available.
Bringing in &quot;key improvements and features&quot;, developer Starbreeze says the update is a &quot;focused effort responding to community expectations and improving the quality&quot; of the beleaguered FPS, and includes &quot;sought-after&quot; features as well as 300 tweaks to improve matchmaking, stability, and even the gameplay.
Described as a &quot;grand game improvement project&quot; – some of it resulting from a candid AMA hosted on Reddit earlier this month – Operation Medic Bag seeks to address all aspects of Payday 3. This first patch &quot;includes focus initiatives, such as rotating security modifiers, an unready button and improved controller settings&quot;, as well as support for various &quot;Nvidia technologies&quot;.

                              <span>EA and BioWare are &quot;pretty confident&quot; that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will be released later this year.
That&#x27;s according to industry insider Jeff Grubb, who said on yesterday&#x27;s Game Mess podcast that whilst it wasn&#x27;t clear when the game would next be shown, &quot;it will be released this year&quot;.
&quot;I suspect [Dragon Age: Dreadwolf] ] will probably pop up this summer,&quot; Grubb said (thanks, wccftech). &quot;I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;ll be shown, but [I] assume it will be shown sometime this summer. Could happen at any time, though.

                              <span>Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, the lovely looking musical adventure based on Tove Jansson&#x27;s classic series of children&#x27;s stories, finally has a released date and will be launching for Switch and PC via Steam on Tuesday, 7th March.


Melody of Moominvalley sees players slipping into the oversized green hat of the wanderer Snufkin, as he harnesses the power of music - and his trusty harmonica - to restore nature after the Park Keeper and his minions build hideous parks all over Moominvalley.


&quot;As Snufkin you will distract police officers, pull out signs, and knock over misplaced statues,&quot; explains Norweigian developer Hyper Games, &quot;as you vigorously try to restore nature and the inhabitants&#x27; home while putting an end to the industrious Park Keeper&#x27;s plans.&quot;

                              <span>Balatro, the poker-themed rogue-like from solo developer LocalThunk that&#x27;s been a huge critical and commercial hit since releasing last week, has been unexpectedly yanked from sale in some countries, with publisher Playstack blaming the issue on a surprise ratings change.


Playstack addressed the issue in a lengthy statement shared on social media, explaining Balatro&#x27;s temporary removal from console stores had so far only happened &quot;some countries&quot;. It admitted it could not &quot;estimate with complete confidence which stores&quot; had been impacted, adding, &quot;Our hope is that only a minority of stores will be affected&quot;. It says it remains &quot;highly confident&quot; Balatro will remain available on PC, including Steam.


The cause of all this frustration is an unexpected &quot;overnight change&quot; to Balatro&#x27;s age rating, which has been bumped from 3+ to 18+. According to Playstack, this change stems from an unspecified ratings board&#x27;s &quot;mistaken belief that the game &#x27;contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling&#x27;&quot;.

                              <span>Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has announced its dark action-RPG No Rest for the Wicked will launch into Steam early access on 18th April.


No Rest for the Wicked, which was unveiled during last year&#x27;s The Game Awards, is described by Moon Studios as an &quot;expansive&quot; and &quot;visceral&quot; action-RPG that&#x27;s &quot;set to reinvent the genre&quot;. It casts players as a Cerim - a holy warrior &quot;imbued with remarkable powers&quot; - who embarks on a journey across the harsh Isola Sacra to defeat an unholy plague.


Its campaign promises a &quot;mature, dark&quot; narrative, as well as &quot;brutal, precision-based&quot; combat, and a hand-crafted world, with players can take on No Rest for the Wicked&#x27;s challenges, quests, and bosses either solo or with up to three friends by their side.

                              <span>Four new cast members have been announced for The Last of Us Season 2.
As reported by Variety, Danny Ramirez, Tati Gabrielle, Ariela Barer and Spencer Lord have all joined HBO&#x27;s adaptation. Those who have played The Last of Us Part 2 will recognise their characters as members of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF).
Ramirez, whose previous acting credits include Top Gun: Maverick and Marvel&#x27;s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, will play Manny. The show&#x27;s description states Manny is &quot;a loyal soldier whose sunny outlook belies the pain of old wounds and a fear that he will fail his friends when they need him most&quot;. Barer, meanwhile, will play Mel, described as &quot;a young doctor whose commitment to saving lives is challenged by the realities of war and tribalism&quot;.

This year marks the fourth annual Frost Fatales event -  which, like its summertime equivalent Flame Fatales, is specifically intended to showcase women and femmes in the speedrunning community - and proceedings get underway this Sunday, 3rd March, at 5.30pm UK time.


Then, across the next seven days, Frost Fatales has scheduled over 60 speedruns - which, as always, cover a broad spectrum of games, including acclaimed indies, retro classics, and oddities, with a small selection of more modern blockbusters also putting in an appearance.

                              <span>Developers at GTA 6 studio Rockstar Games have criticised the company for telling employees they must return to the office full-time next month, calling leadership&#x27;s decision &quot;reckless&quot;.
As reported yesterday, employees at Rockstar have been told to return to the office five days a week, now that GTA 6 is entering the final stretch of development. Studio management cited security and productivity reasons for this upcoming change, which will come into effect in April.
Since this announcement, the Independent Workers&#x27; Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has blasted Rockstar for its plans to withdraw remote working provisions for the &quot;majority&quot; of its staff, noting the studio said any exceptions to the new rules will be &quot;rare&quot;.

Venba&#x27;s Cookbook DLC will arrive on 13th March and - even better - when it does arrive, it will be free for all owners of the base game. 


Venba&#x27;s upcoming DLC will offer players a way to look through detailed recipes for the dishes made in the game. This is something, let&#x27;s be honest, we all wanted while playing along. Everything just looked (and sounded) so delicious.

A message sent around the official Arrowhead Discord this morning warned the community of these fake games, stating that the only legitimate releases were Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2: Super Citizen Edition with the correct release date of 8th February.
&quot;People posting as us trying to scam people is obviously very sad and frustrating, and for that as well as for security reasons we urge you to stay clear of them,&quot; Arrowhead&#x27;s community manager wrote. &quot;Again, the only two Helldivers 2 products we market are Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2 Super Citizen Edition.&quot;

                              <span>Crash Team Rumble will have no further content updates after 4th March, less than nine months after its launch.
The strategic platformer MOBA launched on 20th June 2023 on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Since then it&#x27;s had three seasons of new content, the latest being a crossover with Spyro the Dragon.
There will be no further seasons, however, per an in-game news update spotted by players of Crash Team Rumble. As of yet, there&#x27;s been no official announcement from publisher Activision itself.

                              <span>Destiny 2 is adding a new kind of vehicle - the hoverboard-esque Skimmer - in its next update due on Tuesday, 5th March. 


Skimmers will let players zoom around looking cool, pull off tricks and even grind on rails. They&#x27;ll live alongside Sparrows - the game&#x27;s traditional Star Wars speeder bikes - in your inventory.


As with anything fun or cool, the first hit is free - all players will get a Skimmer as part of the upcoming Guardian Games All-Stars event. A second Skimmer &quot;inspired by a beloved Destiny weapon&quot; will be available to buy via Destiny 2&#x27;s Eververse microtransaction shop.

                              <span>Another Thursday, another Epic Games Store freebie to add to your ever-growing backlog, this time in the form of stylish 3D side-scroller Never Yield.


Never Yield - also known as Aerial_Knight&#x27;s Never Yield to ensure you don&#x27;t forget who developed it - released back in 2021, offering up an experience something like a classic endless runner. It sees players stampeding across a strikingly designed future Tokyo, all to a winning soundtrack created by Detroit artist Danime-Sama.


&quot;Take the role of Wally,&quot; explains Never Yield&#x27;s official description. &quot;A mysterious character that has recovered what was taken from him. Hopefully, you&#x27;re fast enough to outrun your enemies. Expose the truth and try to uncover the mystery of what happened to them.&quot;

                              <span>Vampire Survivors might continue to be suspiciously devoid of vampires, but it does now have a bunch of new cosmic sci-fi bits (clearly last year&#x27;s Among Us collaboration just wasn&#x27;t space-y enough), courtesy of its latest free update on Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and mobile.


Space 54, as the update is known, introduces a new bonus stage going by the same name - officially described as a &quot;cosmic border-realm between this plane of existence and a sinister, third dimension&quot; - as well as two new characters to deploy.


One of those characters, Space Dude, is the star of developer Poncle&#x27;s energetic Space 54 trailer (or Space-54, or Space54 - the studio doesn&#x27;t seem to have entirely made its mind up), and there&#x27;s also four new weapons, a new relic, and seven new EXTRA achievements.

                              <span>Terminator: Survivors, the previously untitled open-world Terminator game announced by publisher Nacon back in July 2022, has resurfaced with a new cinematic trailer and a Steam early access launch day of 24th October this year.


Terminator: Survivors is being developed by Nacon Studio Milan, the team behind motorcycle racer Rims Racing and TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3, and is set four years after the catastrophic Judgment Day prophesised in the first two Terminator films.


Cast as a survivor of humanity&#x27;s near-extinction, players - either working solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - must attempt to &quot;reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating you and the last vestiges of mankind.&quot;

                              <span>Toys for Bob - the Activision Blizzard studio behind the likes of Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot 4, and the Spyro remasters - has announced it&#x27;s parting ways with Activision to become an independent company once more. It also says it&#x27;s &quot;exploring a possible partnership&quot; with Microsoft as development on its new game gets underway.


Toys for Bob, which was founded back in 1989, formed a publishing partnership with Activision in the 2000s that would lead to the studio&#x27;s acquisition by the publisher in 2005. Toys for Bob has been part of Activision Blizzard ever since, initially working on the hugely popular toys-to-life Skylanders series before developing 2018 remaster Spyro Reignited Trilogy and 2020&#x27;s well-received Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. Since then, it&#x27;s served as a support studio for Call of Duty while also releasing last year&#x27;s Crash Team Rumble.


Earlier this month, following Microsoft&#x27;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard and subsequent decision to lay off 1,900 workers across its Xbox teams, it was confirmed 86 Toys for Bob employees had lost their jobs. It was also reported the studio&#x27;s physical office would be shutting down and that remaining staff would transition to working from home. And it&#x27;s in this context that Toys for Bob has now announced it&#x27;s splitting from Activision to go independent.

                              <span>Following reports last year that Embracer Group was considering selling Borderlands studio Gearbox as part of its ongoing &quot;comprehensive restructuring programme&quot;, it&#x27;s now being claimed a sale to a third party is in the &quot;late stages&quot; of being finalised.


That&#x27;s according to Kotaku, which says Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford had previously told staff the studio was facing one of three possible scenarios: it would either stay with Embracer, be sold, or would finance a buyout and become independent once more. However, Pitchford reportedly shared an update with employees earlier this week, saying a decision had been made - and that decision, according to Kotaku&#x27;s sources, was to sell.


The publication understands Gearbox&#x27;s sale to an unnamed buyer is currently in the &quot;late stages of being finalised&quot;, and while Embracer Group - which purchased Gearbox for $363m in 2021 - did not respond to Kotaku&#x27;s requests for comment, Pitchford deflected the website&#x27;s inquiries, saying, &quot;We will be thrilled to share whenever we have projects to announce or news to share as we work hard towards our mission to entertain the world.&quot;

                              <span>Leap day is now upon us and a couple of games aren&#x27;t happy about this sudden affront to their usual calendar expectations. Both EA Sports WRC and Theatrhythm Final Bar Line are currently protesting at the arrival of 29th February by refusing to function on consoles - but, luckily for rally fans and beat tappers, there&#x27;s a pretty straightforward workaround.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line players noticed the Final Fantasy-themed PS4 and Switch rhythm game was failing to connect to Square Enix&#x27;s servers after the clock struck midnight heralding the arrival 29th February, leaving it functionally unplayable.


Similarly, EA took to social media earlier today to acknowledge Codemasters&#x27; World Championship Rally was encountering an &quot;issue on console in which the game may crash on startup.&quot; And while it didn&#x27;t explicitly blame the problem on today&#x27;s leap year, the publisher&#x27;s follow-up solution makes it clear 29th February is the culprit.

The CSF 2.0, which supports implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, has an expanded scope that goes beyond protecting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and power plants, to all organizations in any sector. It also has a new focus on governance, which encompasses how organizations make and carry out informed decisions on cybersecurity strategy.

One of the most popular ways developers use Kubernetes-related services is via cloud providers, but
have you ever wondered how cloud providers can do that? How does this whole process of integration
of Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let&#x27;s put the spotlight on SIG
Cloud Provider.
SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud
providers. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear
standards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is
their responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations.

                              <span>Embracer Group is set to sell Saber Interactive in a deal worth up to $500m, according to a report from Bloomberg.



Saber will continue to work on its remake of Star Wars: The Knights of the Old Republic after development was removed from Aspyr in 2022.


This deal is just the latest from Embracer as part of its restructuring programme that&#x27;s already seen over a thousand staff laid off and studios closed.

                              <span>Amazon is offering eight games to Prime Gaming subscribers in March, including Fallout 2 and Invincible Presents: Atom Eve. 
The month will start out with Fallout 2 to promote Amazon&#x27;s upcoming Fallout adaptation, which is set to premiere on 12th April. We got a good look at the show in December when Amazon released a teaser trailer, following numerous set leaks and official promotional photos.
If you haven&#x27;t played it, Fallout 2 is one of the classic RPGs which still holds up today. In 2017, Eurogamer was able to visit Obsidian Entertainment and speak to Feargus Urquhart, Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain, who all previously worked on Fallout 1 and 2 whilst at Interplay Productions.

                              <span>Sony-acquired studio Firesprite has recently suffered high profile exits amid accusations of a toxic workplace culture, Eurogamer has been told, as part of an investigation into the studio begun ahead of the layoffs announced by Sony this week.


The Liverpool-based developer released PlayStation VR2 launch title Horizon Call of the Mountain last year, after being acquired by Sony in 2021. But the impact of crunch for that game&#x27;s release and changes in the company&#x27;s senior leadership have subsequently led to discontent within the studio, staff have told Eurogamer - something one source described as &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;.


Most concerning are reports from sources that two senior leaders from Sony support studio XDev, brought in to help lead Firesprite, have since been accused of sexual discrimination and ageism. A subsequent internal investigation by Sony is said to have resulted in the claims being dismissed as a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.

To honour today&#x27;s release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Google has hidden a little Chocobo treat for us all. All you have to do is type the words &quot;Chocobo&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; into the search bar, and you will be met with a little Chocobo icon in the lower right corner.
Hit this button, and soon your screen will be full of charging Chocobos, their feet pounding away making everything shake and shimmy. Cloud even pops up riding on the back of one, his Buster Sword held aloft as though he is riding into battle. You can see how it looks in the video below.

                              <span>If you, like the rest of the internet, have been swept up in the trainwreck that was the Willy Wonka Experience held in an empty warehouse in Glasgow last weekend, we have good news. While you may no longer be able to witness the real event in person, you can always relive it vicariously through your Sims. 
Glasgow&#x27;s Willy Wonka Experience has gone viral for its emptily-decorated space, its AI-generated scripts, and the random shadowy figure called The Unknown who was scaring children.
The whole thing went so badly, it was cancelled halfway through Saturday after police were called to the event, but not before someone could snap one of the most memorable pictures from it - a sad Oompa Loompa being forced to conduct experiments by event organiser House of Illuminati.

                              <span>Today I learned there is a Dungeons and Dragons-like Game Master (GM) working behind the scenes on Helldivers 2.
His name is Joel, and his job title at Arrowhead is, well, Game Master. &quot;We have a lot of systems built into the game where the Game Master has a lot of control over the play experience. It&#x27;s something that we&#x27;re continuously evolving based on what&#x27;s happening in the game,&quot; Helldivers 2 game director Johan Pilestedt told PC Gamer.
This continuous evolution has actually seen Joel getting up at unsociable hours to sort out situations when the Helldivers 2 team realised the game wasn&#x27;t as balanced as it could be. &quot;There have been some sudden moments where maybe one planet was too easy or one was too hard and [Joel] had to get up in the middle of the night to give the Automatons a bit of reinforcement so the players don&#x27;t take [the planet] too quickly,&quot; Pilestedt said.

                              <span>Larian has released another Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 hotfix across PC, PS5 and Mac. It is expected to arrive on Xbox at a later date. 


This hotfix takes aim at several bugs and quirks still lingering in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. This includes a fix for banding and shader issues in cinematics and those times characters claimed to be too busy to talk to you. &quot;They were lying,&quot; Larian explained.
Meanwhile, Minthara should no longer refuse to follow along with the party in Acts 2 and 3. In the developer&#x27;s own words: &quot;You should find her more willing to fall in line now - at least in terms of keeping up. She&#x27;s still something of a free spirit.&quot;

We already knew these were on the way - the game&#x27;s Report for Duty trailer (below) features mechs captioned &quot;coming soon after launch&quot;, plus the first game featured mechs.


But now that server issues due to the game&#x27;s popularity have been sorted, it seems developer Arrowhead Studios is finally moving on to more interesting improvements.

Ascendant Studios founder Bret Robbins, who also served as creative director on the first Dead Space game, made the comment in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz reflecting on the launch and future of the developer&#x27;s debut game.
Despite initial poor sales and lacklustre reviews for Immortals of Aveum when it released in August 2023, Robbins said he believes the game&#x27;s future will be successful like Dead Space. &quot;People were discovering [Dead Space] for years and years,&quot; Robbins stated, &quot;I think Immortals will be the same.&quot;

                              <span>Employees at Rockstar have been asked to return to the office five days a week, now that GTA 6 enters its final year of development.
As reported by Bloomberg, an email sent to staff by Rockstar&#x27;s head of publishing Jenn Kolbe stated the decision to end hybrid work was made - in part - with security reasons in mind.
Rockstar was the subject of a high profile hack in 2022, in which over 90 screenshots and videos were released online showing work on the then unannounced GTA 6. Then, last year, the studio released its first official GTA 6 trailer ahead of schedule, after it too leaked online.

Ridgeline - previously led by ex-Halo co-creator Lehto - had been working on a narrative-led Battlefield campaign. The project will now be completed by Need for Speed studio Criterion Games.


Writing on social media platform X last night, Lehto said: &quot;Gut punched to see EA lay off my team. So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise.&quot;

                              <span>Following its decision to cut six percent of its workforce last March, EA has announced another round of layoffs - this time affecting 5 percent of staff (around 670 employees) - as it moves away from &quot;future licensed IP&quot; toward its &quot;owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;.


In an email to staff announcing today&#x27;s layoffs, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said the cuts were part of a continuing effort to &quot;optimise our global real estate footprint to best support our business&quot;. 


In order to achieve its goals, Wilson said EA will be &quot;streamlining [its] company operations&quot;, &quot;sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry&quot;. Additionally, it&#x27;ll &quot;double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;.

DreadXP&#x27;s newly announced Paranormal Activity project, which follows the launch of last year&#x27;s VR-focused Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul from VRWERX, is being made in conjunction with Paramount Game Studios and promises to &quot;bring the franchise&#x27;s groundbreaking found-footage style to horror enthusiasts in surprising new ways&quot;.


Specifics are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but DarkStone Digital (AKA solo developer Brian Clarke, who&#x27;s also co-director and creative director of DreadXP) makes mention of a dynamic &quot;haunt system&quot; in the new Paranormal Activity game&#x27;s press release, said to alter the types and intensity of scares tplayers encounter based on their actions.

Warzone Mobile, which is being developed by Activision&#x27;s Digital Legends, Beenox, Shanghai, and Solid State studios, initially launched in Australia back in November 2022. Following its roll-out across a number of other countries, Activision announced it would be getting its full release in autumn last year - but plans changed in October, when the publisher confirmed it had made the decision to postpone its launch to &quot;spring&quot; 2024 in order to &quot;polish up&quot; the experience.


With Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&#x27;s worldwide release now locked down to 21st March, Activision has started talking specifics, confirming the game will launch with two maps: Verdansk - which supports 120-player battle royale matches - and Rebirth Island, which supports 48-player battle royale matches using Gulag-free Resurgence rules.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the shocking news that the next big Pokémon game is mysteriously set to arrive in 2025. Hey, that sounds a lot like the intro to last week&#x27;s episode, when we were discussing Switch 2! Say, could Pokémon Legends: Z-A also be set to arrive on Nintendo&#x27;s next console?
It&#x27;s been a long time since Nintendo didn&#x27;t launch a major Pokémon game or expansion in a calendar year, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A&#x27;s arrival in 2025 certainly looks suspicious - as does yesterday&#x27;s reveal of the game without any look at actual gameplay.
So, have we just been given another piece of the Switch 2 puzzle? What do we expect to see in the mysterious Z-A when it is fully revealed? And how many bad French-themed Pokémon ideas can we come up with? With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>Ahmed Best, who&#x27;s best known for his performance as Jar-Jar Binks in the Star Wars prequels, has issued a cryptic tease that has set Star Wars fans&#x27; tongues wagging.


&quot;Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in,&quot; Best posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of himself clad in a performance capture suit. He accompanied the caption with a string of hashtags:  &quot;#mocap #starwars #jarjarbinks #activision #jedi #sithlord #kelleranbeq&quot;


It&#x27;s unclear what Best is back in a performance capture suit for, though the mention of Activision has fans pondering whether the actor is secretly working on a new Star Wars game from the publisher, or whether he&#x27;s performing mo-cap for some kind of Call of Duty crossover.

As previously reported, Sloclap&#x27;s third-person brawler Sifu will be arriving on the service next month. It will be available on both PlayStation 4 and PS5. Joining it are  three other games - or rather, two others plus the Destiny 2: Witch Queen expansion (for which you&#x27;ll need Destiny 2 in your library to play).

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long old wait for UFO 50 - the 50-strong anthology of 8-bit-inspired games from Spelunky creator Derek Yu&#x27;s Mossmouth studio - but as the seventh anniversary of its announcement approaches this August, Yu has revealed the promising project is currently on track to release in the second half of this year.


When UFO 50 was announced in 2017, the goal was to launch it the following year; that, obviously, did&#x27;t happen, with Yu last year explaining the longer-the-expected development time was simply down to the team having wildly underestimated how long it would take to make 50 games, particularly given Spelunky 2 was being made in the middle of it all.


UFO 50, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar, isn&#x27;t a mini- or micro-game compilation, but a collection of complete 8-bit game experiences (albeit of varying sizes) created as if from a long-forgotten fictional 80s video game company, with sequels and reappearing characters creating a sense of shared continuity. It promises everything from platformers and shoot &#x27;em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and RPGs, with over half featuring local multiplayer including co-op and versus play.

                              <span>Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games has suffered layoffs amid unrest due to relocation and accusations of a &quot;highly toxic company&quot;, reports suggest.


Game director Todd Papy left the studio last month, according to LinkedIn. MassivelyOP has since reported a number of other high profile losses at the company (via Game Developer), including lead producer Jake Ross, level designer Dane Kubicka, Austin QA lead Vincent Sinatra, and Austin senior QA analyst Andrew Rexroth.




Further, former producer Annie Bouffard shared on LinkedIn that she had resigned from a &quot;highly toxic company&quot; and claimed she was &quot;gaslighted&quot; when she expressed concern about potential layoffs. She said mass layoffs had been disguised as a &quot;relocation of staff&quot; when few were able or willing to move.

                              <span>If you are playing through Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered on the Epic Games Store, you may find it is a little different to other versions.
As noted by Small Medipack, the Epic Games Store version  has a range of improvements when compared to other platforms. For example, the Nevada level in Tomb Raider 3 is, overall, &quot;more polished&quot;, thanks to better textures and animations.
Meanwhile, there are more poses on the Epic Games Store version&#x27;s photo mode - 21 in total.

                              <span>We&#x27;re now 20 years on from the release of The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run and we&#x27;re still without a sequel. That said, we now have a nightmarish glimpse into what could have been, perhaps, with a Mario Kart parody sequence in the latest episode of the animated series. 
Episode 12 of season 35, Lisa Gets an F1, aired on 25th February, and follows Lisa as she becomes a professional kid go-kart racer whilst dealing with her anxiety stemming from Homer&#x27;s dangerous driving. As Homer worries about Lisa&#x27;s safety, one night he has a nightmare where he, Lisa, and a number of other children are driving in an off-kilter version of Mario Kart.
&quot;It&#x27;s me, Lisa Mario,&quot; Lisa proclaims at the starting line of Rainbow Road, fully decked out with a blue hat, moustache, and her dress altered to look like Mario&#x27;s overalls. She&#x27;s joined by Ralph dressed up as Toad, Nelson tranformed into Bowser, and one of the Mackleberry twins as Princess Peach.

                              <span>A new documentary has shed more light on Resident Evil 4 Remake&#x27;s development, and shows its director concerned the game would not be ready for its release date.
A recent episode of 100 Cameras - a Japanese documentary series which puts 100 cameras in situ to capture the goings on in any given place - focused on Capcom. Along with a look behind the scenes of Street Fighter 6, the episode also showed a slice of Resident Evil 4 Remake&#x27;s development (thanks, GamesRadar).
At the time of recording, there was only one month left before Resident Evil 4 Remake was set to release, but the game was reportedly riddled with a &quot;storm&quot; of issues. These included game freezes, visual glitches such as characters&#x27; hands not connecting when they are meant to be holding on to each other, and Leon getting sent to &quot;another dimension&quot; as he falls through the floor. One tester said they had found &quot;around 70&quot; new bugs in one day. Things were once so bad, Resident Evil 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Anpo admitted: &quot;At this rate, we won&#x27;t make the release&quot;.

The studio&#x27;s first project will be a AAA first-person game built in Unreal Engine 5 and set in an original universe &quot;with an emphasis on co-operative gameplay&quot;, a press release stated.

                              <span>Fans are hopeful that expansion The Answer will come to Persona 3 Reload after dataminers discovered references to DLC.


Persona 3 Reload released last month as a remake of the 2006 original. However, it was criticised for being incomplete without the inclusion of The Answer expansion and the female protagonist featured in revised versions Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable.


The latest hint to an expansion comes from YouTuber Faz (thanks PCGamer), who discovered an in-game message for completing the game on the highest Merciless difficulty (or at least using a cheat engine to skip ahead).

                              <span>A study conducted by Norwegian researchers has suggested children feel increasing social pressure to spend money in games.
The study, commissioned by the Norwegian government&#x27;s Ministry of Children and Family Affairs, was conducted by researchers Clara Julia Reich and Kamilla Knutsen Steinnes at Oslo Metropolitan University&#x27;s National Institute for Consumer Research.
An overview of the two resulting reports, originally written in Norwegian, by ScienceNorway.no reveals children the pair spoke to worried about being bullied and being unable to make friends unless they spent money to buy cosmetic items (thanks, Crossplay).

                              <span>Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla Games is reportedly cutting 10 percent of its staff.
These reductions at the studio come as part of yesterday&#x27;s announcement that 900 PlayStation employees will lose their jobs across multiple studios and departments. In total, this equates to eight percent of PlayStation&#x27;s workforce.
According to Dutch newspaper AD (via VGC), Guerilla is set to lay off 40 employees, about 10 percent of its staff. Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment.

The lawsuit is against Tropic Haze, the creator of the Yuzu game emulator, which Nintendo said allows users to play its games illegally by circumventing its software encryption.


As such, Nintendo claimed Yuzu facilitates piracy &quot;at a colossal scale&quot;, with pirated versions of Tears of the Kingdom used as an example.

                              <span>Fortnite maker Epic Games has reportedly suffered a ransomware attack, with almost 200GB of data stolen from the company.


That&#x27;s according to group behind the alleged attack, Mogilevich, as reported by Cyber Daily. Epic Games is yet to respond.


The hacked data allegedly includes &quot;email, passwords, full name, payment information, source code and many other data&quot; - though it&#x27;s unclear if this refers to the details of Epic Games employees, customers, or both.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been over seven years since Limbo and Inside developer Playdead first began teasing its mysterious third project, and now - nearly five years since Eurogamer last has cause to write about a sneaky bit of concept art - the studio has shared a handful of new images, confirming (in case there was any doubt) the project is still alive and well.


A first enigmatic bit of concept art for Playdead&#x27;s untitled third game was shared by the developer in 2017, around six months after Inside launched to critical acclaim. At the time, the studio confirmed work was underway on its &quot;next adventure&quot;, with the accompanying artwork pointing to a lonely adventure with sci-fi undertones.


Since then, further bits of atmospheric concept art have sporadically surfaced - first on social media in 2018, then buried in some online job listings in 2019, then on LinkedIn last year - all seemingly pointing to an adventure in which a lone space traveller wanders a desolate planet strewn with abandoned tech. About all we&#x27;ve conclusively learned of the mysterious project in that time, again thanks to Playdead&#x27;s jobs page, is that it&#x27;s a &quot;third-person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe.&quot;

Deck Nine is perhaps best known as the current steward of Square Enix&#x27;s supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange, having created 2017&#x27;s Life is Strange: Before the Storm, 2021&#x27;s Life is Strange: True Colours, and a remaster of series originator Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s acclaimed first instalment in 2022. More recently it co-developed a prequel to popular sci-fi TV show The Expanse alongside the revived Telltales Games.


Deck Nine confirmed its decision to lay off a fifth of its staff - likely around 30 employees based on its most recently shared headcount - in a statement on social media, writing, &quot;Like many others in the games industry right now, Deck Nine has been affected by the game industry&#x27;s worsening market conditions. Today we made the difficult decision to lay off 20% of our staff.&quot;

                              <span>Skull and Bones, the oft-delayed pirate game from Ubisoft that finally arrived earlier this month following almost a decade of development, has released its first season of post-launch content on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - introducing, among other things, new world events, new contracts and bounties, plus a battle-pass-style progression track.


Raging Tides, as Skull and Bones&#x27; first live-service season is officially titled, predominantly focuses on new antagonist Philippe La Peste (AKA the Plague King) and his Fleet of Pestilence. By defeating La Peste&#x27;s advance guard, the Plaguebringers, as they spawn throughout the world, players can raise the fleet&#x27;s hostility level. Once past a certain threshold, they&#x27;ll face a &quot;mighty foe&quot;, which rewards a &quot;rare item&quot; when sunk.


That&#x27;s the core of Raging Tides&#x27; new content, then, but Season 1 also adds two elite boss Kingpin Bounties - Jaws of Retribution: Introducing Zamaharibu and Anguish from the Abyss: Rode Maangodin - which run from 5-26th March and 26th March to 16th April respectively.

                              <span>F1 24, the latest instalment in EA&#x27;s annual racing series, is launching for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam, Epic, and the EA App) on 31st May.


As part of its release date anouncement, EA teases F1 24 will feature an &quot;overhauled&quot; Career mode, a new Dynamic Handling System, and more, but says it&#x27;s saving specific details for a full reveal &quot;in the coming months&quot;. However, for those players happy to hand over money without knowing more, the publisher has today detailed a number of F1 24 pre-order bonuses.


Two versions of F1 24 are now available to pre-order: the Standard Edition (containing 5,000 Pitcoin and an F1 World Starter Pack) plus the F1 24 Champions Edition, which includes two new Formula 1 Icons, 18,000 Pitcoin, the F1 World Bumper Pack, a bonus VIP Podium Pass, and up to three days of early access starting from 28th May.

                              <span>Publisher NIS America has confirmed a western release for action-RPG Reynatis, which was revealed during the Japanese version of last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.
Reynatis wasn&#x27;t present in the showcase for overseas, but yesterday NIS America announced it&#x27;ll also be released outside of Japan on Nintendo Switch, PC (Steam), PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
The announcement trailer gives us a flavour of the magic-infused world of Reynatis, set in contemporary Shibuya.  The immediate vibes the trailer gives off are Kingdom Hearts meets The World Ends With You, with some hints of Final Fantasy Versus 13 and Kingdom Hearts 3&#x27;s game-within-a-game Verum Rex. You have my attention, Reynatis.

                              <span>Happy Pokémon Day 2024! This year&#x27;s celebrations have been capped off with a relatively short Pokémon Presents livestream, showcasing what&#x27;s in store for the franchise this year and beyond - including Pokémon Legends: Z-A.
Though there was no mention of a main game releasing this year, there&#x27;s a couple of substantial projects to look forward to. Here&#x27;s a roundnup of everything announced during Pokémon Presents for Pokémon Day 2024.
First up, those of you still enjoying Pokémon Scarlet and Violet can challenge a mighty Venusaur, Blastoise, and Charizard in upcoming Tera Raid battles. Mighty Venusaur will be available from tomorrow, 28th March, for a week, after which mighty Blastoise and mighty Charizard will follow.

                              <span>As has become tradition, we have a PS Plus Essential game leak for the month ahead.
According to the ever reliable billbil-kun of Dealabs, who has a track record of being right with these things, next month we will be able to get our hands on the standard edition of Sifu. If you aren&#x27;t aware, Sifu is a third-person brawler with &quot;tight Kung Fu combat mechanics and cinematic martial arts action&quot;. It was released by developer Sloclap back in 2022.
Sifu will be available across all PS Plus tiers from 5th March until 2nd April, billbil-kun says.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has announced Pokémon Legends: Z-A, a new Nintendo Switch (and Switch 2?) game to launch in 2025.
The announcement was made at the end of today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents stream, in celebration of Pokémon Day 2024.
Pokémon Legends: Z-A looks to be a follow-up to 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Legends: Arceus but set in a futuristic version of Kalos from Pokémon X and Y - the opposite of Arceus, which transported players to a historical version of Sinnoh. A trailer showed a futuristic version of Lumiose City from Pokémon X and Y, which looked a bit like the Grid in Tron.

                              <span>PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst has confirmed that some projects have been cancelled in the wake of layoffs across Sony Interactive Entertainment.


Earlier today, SIE president and CEO Jim Ryan announced 900 layoffs would take place across the company, including the complete closure of PlayStation London Studios.

Hulst then followed up with a further statement, to discuss the impact of this workforce reduction and a &quot;re-evaluation of how we operate&quot;.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s partnership with Lego continues today with the launch of two family-friendly mini-games: Lego Raft Survival and Lego Obby Fun. 


The first of these is a multiplayer mini-game themed around Lego&#x27;s popular pirates theme, where you must stay afloat on a raft - and repair it on the fly - while it is under attack from cannon fire. 


The latter is an obstacle course mini-game similar to those found within Fortnite&#x27;s user-made Creative mode already - think along the lines of its many parkour levels or popular Only Up maps.

                              <span>Sony is to lay off 900 people, equating to eight percent of its workforce. This reduction will see PlayStation Studios&#x27; London Studio close in its entirety, plus reductions made within Sony&#x27;s Firesprite studio. There will also be reductions in various functions across SIE in the UK
In a post earlier today, Sony&#x27;s Jim Ryan said the company&#x27;s PlayStation community meant &quot;everything to us&quot;, and therefore it felt compelled to share an update on the current situation.
&quot;We have made the extremely hard decision to announce our plan to commence a reduction of our overall headcount globally by about eight percent or about 900 people, subject to local law and consultation processes. Employees across the globe, including our studios, are impacted,&quot; Ryan wrote.

                              <span>A number of developers have said they are concerned about the future of Apple Arcade, with one person stating there is &quot;the smell of death&quot; around the mobile game subscription service.


A source told mobilegamer.biz that Apple had &quot;cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people&quot; following a &#x27;reboot&#x27; of the subscription in 2021. Other sources, meanwhile, said the company had been steadily cutting developer payouts and upfront fees over recent years.


&quot;We&#x27;re going to see that amount and decrease and decrease and decrease until it&#x27;s pennies,&quot; one developer told the publication. &quot;At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.&quot; Reportedly, when Apple Arcade launched in 2019, it was a different story, with &quot;very generous&quot; upfront and per-play payments.

                              <span>The &quot;biggest regret&quot; of the developer behind Cities: Skylines 2 is the game&#x27;s ongoing lack of modding support, Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen has said.
Writing in the studio&#x27;s latest developer diary, posted on publisher Paradox Interactive&#x27;s forum, Hallikainen also detailed the changes Colossal is now looking into based on player feedback.
The city-builder sequel released in October last year on PC and was immediately criticised by players for its performance issues and, yes, missing official mod support. In response to fan complaints the game&#x27;s launch had been a &quot;mess&quot; and a &quot;disaster&quot;, Hallikainen admitted Colossal would &quot;much rather be in a different position than we are in the moment, but we cannot change the past&quot;.

                              <span>Four years after its initial release, Square Enix has patched Final Fantasy 7 Remake to amend one of Aerith&#x27;s lines at the very end of the game.


The update comes ahead of the release of Rebirth later this week and additionally makes a change in Remake to Tifa&#x27;s outfit seen in a certain flashback to ensure consistency across both games.


But why amend this specific line from Aerith? Fans are now debating, as spotted on ResetEra. The ending of Final Fantasy 7 Remake is discussed below.

                              <span>Former Xbox exclusive Pentiment currently runs smoother on PlayStation 5 than on Xbox Series X/S, fans have realised - prompting the game&#x27;s director to blame the situation on a &quot;bug&quot;. 
Social media user PeterOvo shared a screenshot from a video comparison capturing the frames per second performance between Pentiment on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The former was running at 120fps, while the Xbox version was running at a mere 60fps.
This inconsistency was subsequently brought to the attention of Pentiment&#x27;s director, Josh Sawyer. The developer replied to assure players that 120fps will be enabled for Xbox &quot;in the next patch&quot;.

                              <span>Ark: Survival Ascended developer Studio Wildcard has announced it&#x27;s indefinitely delaying the release of the dinosaur survival remaster&#x27;s enhanced The Center expansion, just days before its planned 28th February release.


Ark: Survival Ascended - the controversial full-price Unreal Engine 5 remaster of 2015&#x27;s Ark: Survival Evolved - has been plagued with delays since its announcement last year. First, the remaster&#x27;s launch was shifted from August to October - a release it eventually managed to hit on PC, albeit with the Xbox Series X/S version getting a last-minute delay to mid-November and the PS5 release arriving later still - while Ascended&#x27;s various expansion remasters, originally due to launch alongside the base game, have now slipped a number of times.


In January, Wildcard announced its Scorched Earth expansion remaster, initially delayed to December 2023 and then moved to March 2024, would now be releasing in April, while its Aberration and Ragnarok map remasters - previously delayed to &quot;Q1 2024&quot; - were now on track to arrive in July and September 2024 respectively. Amid all this furious roadmap revision, there was a bright spot in that the enhanced version of Ark&#x27;s The Center map would now be coming to Ascended a couple of months earlier than listed in December. The Center&#x27;s release was later pinned down to 28th February, but once again it&#x27;s all change.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s first major content update of 2024 arrives this Wednesday, 28th February, introducing Monsters, Inc.&#x27;s Sully and Mike Wazowski to the village - and ahead of its arrival, developer Gameloft has detailed everything this week&#x27;s free patch will bring.


Mike and Sulley arrive as part of what Gameloft is officially calling the Laugh Floor Update, and both make their Dreamlight Valley debut via a new playable Realm - giving players the chance to experience a day-in-the-life at Monsters, Inc. before the duo become available as villagers - each with their own friendship quests and associated rewards.


Other features coming in this week&#x27;s Laugh Floor Update, as detailed in Gameloft&#x27;s newly shared patch notes, include more avatar customisation options - ranging from new skin tones and special eye contacts to new ear styles - plus an expansion to Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s shop, meaning players will see more items to spend their in-game gold on each day.

                              <span>Stardew Valley is celebrating its eighth anniversary today (yes, I couldn&#x27;t believe it either) and developer Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone has marked the occasion by announcing a release date for his beloved farm-life sim&#x27;s eagerly awaited 1.6 update - which is coming to PC on 19th March, with a console and mobile release to follow &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.


Stardew Valley&#x27;s 1.6 update was revealed to be in the works back in June 2022, when Barone warned it would be relatively modest in scope and &#x27;mostly modding-focused&#x27;. Since then, however, it&#x27;s ballooned substantially, with Barone so far confirming it&#x27;ll bring one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and crafting recipes, new dialogue lines, a new farm type, new late-game content, winter outfits for villagers, a new larger chest, 8-player co-op on PC, plus - most importantly of all - hats for cats and dogs.


It was exactly one month ago today that Barone last shared a progress report on 1.6&#x27;s development, revealing he was &quot;done adding major new content&quot; and that it would &quot;definitely&quot; release this year - and we now have an exact date to mark in our calendars.

                              <span>What the Golf? developer Triband is bringing its absurdist racing game What the Car? to Steam later this year, following its debut last May as an Apple Arcade exclusive.


What the Car? follows in the wonderfully daft footsteps of What the Golf? - and indeed its VR-exclusive baseball-inspired successor What the Bat? - by taking a relatively sensible sport (in this case racing) and sillying it up to the extreme.


If you&#x27;ve long been of the opinion racing games would be a whole lot better if the cars had legs and the racing was spiced up a bit with some cooking, rope jumpinga, CAR-aoke, or even fishing, then What the Car? is probably just what you&#x27;re looking for.

Lots of details in the news articles.

The studio halted production last week on 19th February, it revealed today, and said it made the news public to help its members find roles elsewhere.

The studio confirmed it would shed staff via a statement posted to social media platform X, in which it blamed &quot;significant challenges&quot; facing the games industry to which it was not &quot;immune&quot;. 


A Bloomberg report states around 150 people were told their jobs were at risk this morning, with around 90 staff eventually expected to leave the business following a consultation period. Supermassive is believed to currently employ around 350 staff in total.

Co-op has now been confirmed for Rise of the Ronin via the game&#x27;s FAQ section (spotted by Okami13_ on X), which states players can join up to three others in online co-op. The FAQs also confirm there will be no PvP in Rise of the Ronin.

Word of the crossover appeared online last night courtesy of prolific Fortnite leaker iFireMonkey, as spotted in the game&#x27;s code. It looks like Avatar will be Fortnite&#x27;s next themed event  pass, following the current Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles event.

                              <span>Nintendo is currently set to launch its under-wraps Switch 2 console in March 2025 - but this could be delayed further, a new report has cautioned. 


The fresh report, this time from Japanese newspaper Nikkei, has further confirmed this month&#x27;s reports that Switch 2 will now arrive next year, after having previously been set for a late 2024 launch. 


Eurogamer sources told us previously that a delay to 2025 was intended to ensure Switch 2 arrived with a robust game line-up, something Nikkei&#x27;s report also mentions. Nikkei additionally suggests a move to 2025 will ensure Switch 2 console stock will also be more readily available.

                              <span>Legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu probably won&#x27;t compose the score for a whole game again.


The composer was interviewed by German publication Zeit Online (via VGC) ahead of his new orchestral piece Merregnon: Heart of Ice and discussed whether he might compose an entire score in future.


&quot;As far as Final Fantasy is concerned, I&#x27;m still involved by writing the main themes for the games,&quot; he said. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll compose music for a whole game again.

Douse took to the platform again yesterday to issue a warning to those making &quot;threats and toxicity against our devs and community teams&quot;, asking them to &quot;please stop that&quot;.

Writing on LinkedIn, Spector said he &quot;can&#x27;t begin to describe how excited I am&quot; about the remake - but that he wasn&#x27;t quietly working on an all-new third entry behind the scenes.

As noted by Chris Dring from Eurogamer&#x27;s sister site GamesIndustry.biz, this marks the second week in a row in which the game has seen a comparative sales increase - an unusual occurrence. 
Helldivers 2 is currently sat at number four in the UK&#x27;s physical chart, behind Mario vs Donkey Kong, Hogwarts Legacy and EA Sports FC 24. Ubisoft&#x27;s beleaguered pirate game Skull and Bones has tumbled down to sixteenth place, meanwhile.

&quot;[Bravely] Default 2 3rd anniversary celebration!&quot; Asano wrote, as translated by Google. &quot;Many messages will be sent during the year-end and New Year project. Thank you!

                              <span>Footage of what&#x27;s claimed to be an &quot;internal demo&quot; of LittleBigPlanet Hub – the free-to-play PS3 exclusive announced initially, and expected to be released, in 2013 – has popped up online.
Whilst the game was never formally cancelled, it was never released, either, which makes the footage – which is complete with voicework from series stalwart Stephen Fry and the costumes and gameplay long associated with the family-friendly platformer – all the more surprising.
&quot;LittleBigPlanet Hub beta official gameplay full walkthrough recorded in 2013,&quot; is all the YouTube video&#x27;s description says, with a later Short from the same account alleging that the build was still live and could still be downloaded.

                              <span>Apple announced PQ3, its post-quantum encryption standard based on the Kyber secure key-encapsulation protocol, one of the post-quantum algorithms selected by NIST in 2022.
There’s a lot of detail in the Apple blog post, and more in Douglas Stabila’s security analysis.
I am of two minds about this. On the one hand, it’s probably premature to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms. The mathematics of cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly evolving, and we’re likely to break more of them—and learn a lot in the process—over the coming few years. But if you’re going to make the switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple’s ability to do this so efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against, attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them later on future quantum computers...</span>

                              <span>Think you know everything there is to know about Elden Ring? Think again, Tarnished – according to director Hidetaka Miyazaki, there&#x27;s still &quot;a small element&quot; yet to be discovered.
Whilst the director wouldn&#x27;t be drawn on what, exactly, that &quot;small element&quot; entailed or where players should be looking, Miyazaki said the team was &quot;always surprised and delighted by how much the players do discover, and how much these communities work to uncover these secrets&quot;.
Talking to IGN, Miyazaki said that whether it was up to interpretation or &quot;just further investigation&quot;, fans needed to look a little harder to find it.

                              <span>Yoko Taro has dropped a sneaky tease that a new Nier game may be on the way.
In a surprise appearance at the Nier: Orchestra Concert in London earlier this month, director Taro invited fans to applaud as loudly as they could to ensure the Square Enix president – who was reportedly also in attendance – knew there was an appetite for a sequel.
According to someone there that night, &quot;the room immediately erupted into claps, cheers and yells&quot;.

Arrowhead Game Studios&#x27; CEO and Helldivers 2&#x27;s creative director Johan Pilestedt confirmed the cap had been increased over the weekend whilst thanking the &quot;studio of ~100 devs&quot; for their &quot;amazing achievement&quot;.
&quot;I&#x27;m really happy and proud of the [Arrowhead Game Studio] team for an amazing achievement, the servers handled all Helldivers 2 players this weekend without problem,&quot; Pilestedt wrote on X/Twitter, adding that now that the servers were more stable, the team would have &quot;time to focus on improvements to the title and resume [its] original plan&quot;.

                              <span>Halo co-creator and Battlefield game director Marcus Letho has left EA.
Letho – who had been heading up Seattle-based Ridgeline Games, an EA studio dedicated to the Battlefield franchise – has seemingly scrubbed all mentions of Battlefield and EA from their social media bio, as well as updated their LinkedIn to state they&#x27;ve now left EA.
As spotted by &quot;Battlefield connoisseur&quot; DANNYonPC and Insider Gaming, Ridgeline Games currently has no job openings on its careers site, and Ridgeline&#x27;s co-founder and art director, Chris Matthews, also left the studio in January 2024 to join Destiny developer Bungie as studio art director.

                              <span>Rainbow Six Siege&#x27;s creative director seemingly doesn&#x27;t have any plans for a sequel.
Talking at today&#x27;s Siege Invitational 2024 in Brazil, Alexander Karpazis said that having watched other live services games &quot;go through sequels&quot; and &quot;just completely drop the ball&quot;, the team would rather &quot;build up&quot; the fan-favourite shooter instead of making a new one.

Showing off the &quot;Reloaded Edition&quot; in &quot;all its glory&quot;, the free trial runs from now until 6pm UK time (10am PT / 1pm ET / 7pm CET) on Monday 26th February, and includes a free welcome pack with items that will remain in your inventory should you decide to visit again.
Progress will save and carry over should you wish to pick up a copy of the game later down the line, and the Reloaded Edition - which includes the first story DLC and the highly-anticipated firearms update - is currently 50 per cent off.

                              <span>Ubisoft has teased its future plans for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, saying the acclaimed Metroidvania will be getting new content and modes in free updates starting &quot;soon&quot;.


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown enjoyed significant critical acclaim when it launched back in January - Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan called it a &quot;real delight...that revels in both its genre and its own heritage&quot; in his four star review - and while early reports have suggested it hasn&#x27;t fared quite so well commercially, Ubisoft clearly isn&#x27;t done with the title yet.


In a short video message shared on social media (as spotted by VGC), Lost Crown director Mounir Radi thanked fans for their support, saying, &quot;It means the world to us seeing you enjoy your time with the game just as much as we do. Which is why, I&#x27;m especially pleased to let you know that we are far from being done&quot;.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly preparing to launch a new white, digital-only version of its top-end Xbox Series X console in &quot;June or July&quot; this year.


An &quot;adorably all-digital&quot; Xbox Series X refresh, planned for a 2024 release, first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year&#x27;s court battle with the FTC. However, Xbox boss Phil Spencer later insisted &quot;so much has changed&quot; since the plans detailed in the leak had been drawn up, leaving the all-digital console&#x27;s future uncertain.


But now, noted leaker eXtas1s (writing for Exputer) has claimed that not only are Microsoft&#x27;s all-digital Xbox Series X plans still alive, the console is set to release &quot;sometime between the upcoming months of June and July&quot; - although &quot;chances for a slight delay&quot; remain.

                              <span>If you didn&#x27;t get chance to put No Man&#x27;s Sky through its paces during its free to play event last weekend - or if you did and you want to do it all over again, no purchase required - developer Hello Games has announced its exploratory space sim is free to download and play right now  for the next few days because it all proved so popular last time.


In its free weekend round two announcement, Hello Games says its first attempt &quot;worked better than expected&quot; and No Man&#x27;s Sky &quot;started the year with more players than we&#x27;ve EVER had at this time of year&quot;, adding, &quot;Our large and friendly community did us proud and jumped at the opportunity to welcome these new Travellers with open arms and show them the ropes.&quot;


As before, No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s free weekend is open to players on all platforms - Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - and the latest festivities conclude on Monday, 26th February. Any progress made during the event will be carried over to the full game if you&#x27;re convinced enough that you decide to make a purchase, and the previous 50 percent discount is still available across digital storefronts, meaning you can pick it up for around £19.99.

The giveaway was announced by Xbox over on X (née Twitter), alongside what I assume is a mock-up of the final design. 
The console features the game&#x27;s cover art and logo, while the four controllers bundled with it come in four different colours with four different Pals on: yellow (Grizzbolt), green (Mammorest), blue (Pengullet), and pink (Cattiva).

                              <span>SteamWorld Build publisher Thunderful said the game &quot;fell slightly short of expectations&quot;, as its company restructure is &quot;off to a good start&quot;.


The game was the latest in the SteamWorld series that turned to strategy and base building gameplay, and was released at the start of December last year.


During the company&#x27;s latest financial reporting, Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz put the blame on genre choice not being suited to the Switch, where the series is traditionally stronger (thanks Game Developer). That&#x27;s despite the game&#x27;s sales contributing to a record high Q4.

The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase earlier this week revealed a host of games still on the way to the Switch later this year, but the Japanese version of the showcase additionally included the Game Boy Advance game Mother 3 as part of the expansion pass.


Fans were up in arms on social media, even going as far as to pester series creator Shigesato Itoi.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has failed to meet publisher Warner Bros&#x27; expectations.
During a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said Rocksteady&#x27;s recent release had &quot;fallen short of our expectations&quot; (thanks, IGN).
The executive did not share any sales figures for Suicide Squard: Kill the Justice League during this call, but admitted it had left the company with a &quot;tough year&quot; ahead when it comes to year-on-year comparisons. Last year, Warner Bros. published Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy, the latter of which became the best selling game in the US in 2023.

                              <span>Inflexion is prioritising an offline play mode for Nightingale. This follows on from player feedback, with many questioning the developer&#x27;s decision to make Nightingale online-only on its early access release earlier this month.
In an update on Steam, the Nightingale team said its vision was always to &quot;create an interconnected series of Realms, with the idea of allowing for co-operative exploration in mind - a universe bigger than a single Realm or server&quot;. 
As such, the studio made the decision early on to support co-op from day one, rather than focus on an offline mode.

Meanwhile, fans peering inside of Fortnite&#x27;s files have datamined some surprising map updates set to herald the start of an Ancient Greek mythology period.


A new NPC character named Odyssey can be found just outside Risky Reels who you can chat to for an update on the current season&#x27;s storyline (which has so far been pretty threadbare) and a tease for what&#x27;s next: something to do with an ancient power named the Mosaic.

                              <span>Several months down the line from Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&#x27;s launch, fans have been discussing the game&#x27;s ending and whether elements should have played out differently.
This discussion has been prompted by the apparent emergence of an early plan for Spider-Man 2&#x27;s story shared on reddit, originating from the files stolen by hackers who targeted Insomniac Games. In that early draft, one particular plot element was different - sparking debate now on whether it was a good thing Insomniac apparently changed its mind.

If you&#x27;re in any doubt, it&#x27;s pronounced how it&#x27;s spelled, Riot said over on X. Previously it had been referred to as Project L.
I&#x27;m going to assume the name is supposed to mean &quot;two KOs&quot;, given 2XKO is a 2v2 tag-based fighting game. That also means my brain will call the game 2KO rather than 2XKO. I&#x27;m starting to fear this might be a &quot;née Project L&quot; situation...

                              <span>After what has seemed like forever since its initial announcement a year ago, on Wednesday we finally got a full trailer for Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree. 

Eurogamer spoke to creator Hidetaka Miyazaki to gain some more details: it&#x27;s FromSoftware&#x27;s biggest DLC to date, is based on previous workings from George R. R. Martin, and has a developed world design that blurs the line between field areas and dungeons.


But is there more we can garner from the trailer itself? Let&#x27;s go into detail.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Games has announced crossplay will be added to Mortal Kombat 1 in a patch next week, which is also when John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker will be available in early access.
Crossplay, er I mean Krossplay, will be available for players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam and Epic Games Store) from 28th February. Players of the heavily criticised Nintendo Switch version of Mortal Kombat 1 will miss out on 1v1 Kombat League and Kasual matches, 1v1 private matches, and leaderboard stats across the other platforms.
On 28th February, Peacemaker will be available to play as in early access for those who&#x27;ve bought the Kombat Pack. Warner Bros. Games released a gameplay trailer for Peacemaker, where we get to see him using his helmet and its abilities in combat.

                              <span>Cult classic strategy game revival Solium Infernum is now available on Steam, as its developer League of Geeks continues to face an uncertain future. 


This new version of Solium Infernum - where you aim to claim the Infernal Throne of Hell by navigating political intrigue, military strategy and beytrayal - boasts an all-new single-player campaign and asynchronous multiplayer, alongside a visual refresh. 


But behind the scenes, its developer&#x27;s fate seems to remain uncertain. League of Geeks, previously behind the well-received strategy board game Armello, suffered layoffs in December, with around half of its 70-something team let go.

Larian&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse described plans for this official support as &quot;robust&quot;, but did not yet give an exact date for when it will arrive - other than to say it was planned for sometime this year. 


&quot;We have a system but it needs to be tested and still requires work,&quot; Douse explained, noting that the team wanted to avoid any player frustration from game updates breaking mods.

                              <span>Palworld has reached an astonishing 25m players within its first month. 
The numbers, revealed by developer Pocketpair, also confirm 15m players jumped into the action-adventure, monster-taming, survival game on Steam. The other 10m have dived in on Xbox, though Pocketpair didn&#x27;t specify how many of these were players who bought a copy of the game versus how many were playing via Xbox Game Pass. 
15m copies of Palworld sold on Steam will have made Pocketpair about $315m, which is around £250m, after taking off Valve&#x27;s 30 percent cut. That money will surely go a long way to helping Pocketpair with its $500k a month spending on servers, as well as hiring developers to no longer be &quot;overwhelmingly short of people&quot;.

Many fans had expected former WWE boss McMahon and frequent WWE champion Lesnar to be cut from the game&#x27;s playable roster as a result, despite the title&#x27;s focus on the past 40 years of Wrestlemania. Indeed, earlier this month, Lesnar was spotted by fans as having been quietly removed from artwork used on the game&#x27;s cover. 

2K published the final roster yesterday on its website via a simple blog post. 204 wrestlers will be available.

                              <span>The upcoming Cate Blanchett-fronted Borderlands film is the start of a &quot;Borderlands Cinematic Universe&quot;,  according to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford. 


Speaking with IGN about the recent Borderlands trailer, Pitchford discussed the film&#x27;s place in the video game universe, saying it &quot;lives side by side&quot;. 


&quot;Of course, the characters are there and authentic in the themes and even some of the storylines. But they&#x27;re independent storylines,&quot; Pitchford told the publication, stating the film isn&#x27;t either Borderlands 1 or 2. Rather, it is &quot;the first of the Borderlands Cinematic Universe&quot;, which means fans of the series will &quot;see some characters from some of the different parts of what you might know from the video games&quot;.

Game director Johan Pilestedt revealed the game&#x27;s new concurrent user cap now stands at 700,000 players, via a post on X. Helldivers 2 is expected to hit this number, although he added: &quot;We believe that the wait times will be much more bearable&quot;.


Patch notes on Steam confirm the raised server cap, as well as a fix for an issue where players would get stuck in cinematics.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss the reports that Nintendo Switch 2 will now launch in 2025, later than its previously-expected arrival towards the end of this year.
Nintendo itself is yet to say anything certain about its inevitable Switch successor, but its steady path towards launch has been tracked by numerous reports. Now, we discuss how this latest news unfolded, why we believe it has happened, and what this means for Nintendo across the rest of 2024.
Plus: some fun speculation on what we hope Nintendo will change for its new hardware (get rid of Joy-Con stick drift, please?) With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy.

                              <span>Behaviour Interactive has announced its latest Dead by Daylight collaboration, and it&#x27;s none other than heavy metal band Iron Maiden. 


This team up will see the band&#x27;s mascot Eddie arrive in the game as part of a new outfit collection, which has been inspired by various Eddie iterations over the years. These looks, which you can see in the trailer below, include The Dredge, The Doctor, The Deathslinger, and The Oni.


There are also new Iron Maiden T-shirts for Dead by Daylight&#x27;s original Survivors.

LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.
In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs...</span>

                              <span>To borrow from Game of Thrones, Minter is coming (please read that in Ned Stark&#x27;s voice). Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story - an interactive documentary experience for PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch - will release next month, on 13th March. 


Coming from Digital Eclipse, this upcoming release invites us all to take a little trip back in time, to &quot;an era of cassette tapes, photocopied zines, and README.TXT&quot;, as it tells the story of the British game designer&#x27;s career. So, expect plenty of psychedelia, radioactive sheep, mutant camels and more.  


Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story will include 42 classic games from across eight different platforms. An interactive timeline will reach all the way back to some of Minter&#x27;s earliest work on the Sinclair ZX81 and Commodore VIC-20, before heading onto projects for the Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari 800, the Atari ST line of computers and Atari&#x27;s Jaguar console of the 90s.

                              <span>Fallout: London - the upcoming fan made DLC-sized mod for Bethesda&#x27;s Fallout 4 - has added Neil Newbon to its cast.


The actor is known for many roles across the video game industry, including Karl Heisenberg in Resident Evil Village. More recently, he played Astarion in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, for which he won the award for Best Performance at last year&#x27;s Game Awards.


Newbon&#x27;s role in Fallout: London is still largely underwraps, with the mod&#x27;s developer simply stating he is part of the voice acting team, as an in-game screenshot is shared (see below).

                              <span>After a year on the market, Sony is now testing PS VR2 compatibility with PC.


This news comes courtesy of a PlayStation blog, which highlights a selection of games coming to its VR platform. 
Along with details on titles such as Zombie Army VR and The Wizards - Dark Times: Brotherhood (which is out today), Sony said it is &quot;currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5&quot;.

                              <span>After several years of silence, Little Devil Inside has resurfaced. You may need to cast your minds back to remember this one. Little Devil Inside first came to light - at least on Eurogamer - back in 2015, when the game achieved its Kickstarter funding goal, although trailers had floated about before then. 


Things then went quiet, before it popped back up in 2020 at a PlayStation 5 reveal event. The following year, we got word that Little Devil Inside would release towards the end of 2022, which evidently did not happen. 


Now, developer Neostream has re-emerged with its first Kickstarter post in four years and a new teaser for Little Devil Inside. The post reads a tad awkwardly, and I suspect it has been run through translation software before being published. However, it appears that there has been quite a lot happening behind the scenes at Neostream, with a some kind of disagreement happening between members of the development team.

                              <span>A recent patch for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has caused more issues than it fixed, fans say.
The game&#x27;s most recent patch was released yesterday, with developer Rocksteady stating it would target &quot;various crashes, progression blockers, connectivity issues and several server side improvements&quot;.
However, there are now numerous reports online of players encountering more issues than before. &quot;The recent patches screwed the game, for a lot of people,&quot; one reddit user acknowledged when another player said their copy of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League now wasn&#x27;t loading past a black screen.

                              <span>Hi-Fi Rush will skip the current Nintendo Switch and instead arrive on the console&#x27;s currently-unannounced successor. 
That&#x27;s according to a report from Insider Gaming, which states that the absence of a Switch version of the game in yesterday&#x27;s Xbox multi-platform announcement was due to it launching on Nintendo Switch 2 instead.


Whether Hi-Fi Rush could still eventually launch for the current Switch as well - perhaps at the same time? - is unclear, the report concluded.


Certainly, a launch for Hi-Fi Rush on a Nintendo platform has been expected. Earlier this year, in-game clothing designs seemed to point to the rhythm action game going multi-platform in the near future. This apparent tease preceded any other multi-platform plans being discussed publicly by Microsoft, and the decision to launch four games on other consoles ultimately being laid out this month.

                              <span>Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree will be available digitally only, even for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S exclusive physical versions.


A Shadow of the Erdtree Edition will be released, including both the base game and the DLC. However this will only be available physically on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the expansion an additional download not on the disc. PC editions are digitally only, while PS4 and Xbox One will only have the DLC as a digital extra.


The DLC, as a standalone addition, will cost £34.99 across all platforms - a significant increase from, say, Bloodborne&#x27;s The Old Hunters DLC that was £15.99 on release. This perhaps speaks to the size of Shadow of the Erdtree as much as the rising cost of games.

                              <span>Surprise! Dead Island 2 has popped up as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription, despite not being listed by Microsoft when it revealed a list of late February Xbox Game Pass titles earlier this week. 


Dead Island 2 publisher Plaion has now confirmed the news, though in a blog post noted the game was &quot;for Ultimate members&quot;. Users have noted that the game&#x27;s PC version was not added to Game Pass for PC.


The unexpected addition to Game Pass follows a free weekend of access to Dead Island 2 via Xbox&#x27;s &quot;Free Play Days&quot; promotion last week.

A new patch for the game has implemented a function that will now boot players back to the title screen if they have been idle for 15 minutes. This is something the community has been asking for a little while now, with many players reporting long queue times to get into the game.
Other points from this latest Helldivers 2 patch include a number of crash fixes. Players should no longer get stuck in the defrosting or in the ship intro cinematic, as well.

The Hi-Fi Rush PS5 launch date was today revealed to be 18th March, courtesy of a new trailer for the rhythm action game posted to Bethesda&#x27;s Latin American YouTube channel. 


That video appears to have gone live a little earlier than planned, as it was soon taken offline by Bethesda - but not before the internet noticed. You can watch it via the embed below, now re-uploaded to social media:

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced a two-month delay for Prison Architect 2, with the management sim sequel now set to release on 7th May as developer Double Eleven opts for &quot;extra time to identify more bugs and further optimise the game&quot;.


Prison Architect 2 - the sequel to the hugely popular 2015 original from developer Introversion Software (who sold the rights to Paradox in 2019) - was announced back in January, promising a take on the prison management formula reimagined in full 3D.


There was talk of some rather nifty looking multi-floor building, and a new connection system defining and impacting the relationships prisoners had with other inmates. All of that was originally due to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th March, but eager sorts will now need to wait until May following today&#x27;s delay.

Learning Kubernetes and the entire ecosystem of technologies around it is not without its
challenges. In this interview, we will talk with Carlos Santana
(AWS) to learn a bit more about how he created the
Kubernetes Book Club, how it works, and
how anyone can join in to take advantage of a community-based learning experience.

Frederico Muñoz (FSM): Hello Carlos, thank you so much for your availability. To start with,
could you tell us a bit about yourself?
Carlos Santana (CS): Of course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six
years ago opened the door for me to join Knative and then contribute to
Kubernetes through the Release Team. Working on upstream Kubernetes has been one of the best
experiences I&#x27;ve had in open-source. Over the…</span>

                              <span>Hidetaka Miyazaki didn&#x27;t envision originating an entire genre. Yet such is the popularity of the Dark Souls games - right up to the more recent Elden Ring - that they&#x27;ve become collectively known in the gaming community as Soulslikes. That&#x27;s shorthand for games with calculating combat, high levels of challenge and repeated death, though this is of course reductive of the awe and grim majesty Miyazaki&#x27;s games evoke.


Soulslikes are everywhere now. From indie games utilising specific mechanics, to larger projects specifically trying to out-do FromSoftware at its own game. That&#x27;s testament to the influence of Miyazaki&#x27;s work, though he remains humble when discussing his oeuvre with me ahead of announcing the release of Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring&#x27;s upcoming major expansion.


&quot;We certainly didn&#x27;t come up with the term Souslike and we didn&#x27;t envision it as a new genre or a new term for the industry,&quot; he tells me. &quot;So of course when it first started cropping up... we were very surprised.

                              <span>FromSoft boss Hidetaka Miyazaki has discussed the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, and the benefits of waiting for new hardware on which to revisit the beloved PlayStation 4 classic.


&quot;It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans,&quot; Miyazaki told Eurogamer when questioned about the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, in an interview timed alongside today&#x27;s proper unveiling of the Elden Ring DLC. &quot;It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it.&quot;


But would a remake benefit from newer hardware to make the release worthwhile? FromSoftware&#x27;s Demon&#x27;s Souls, for example, was remade as a PS5 launch title after originally launching on PS3 - a double console generation leap that meant the re-release felt more significant.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s February Direct Partner Showcase has come and gone. This presentation was focused around third-party games so, as expected, there was no news on any homegrown Nintendo titles or the Switch 2&#x27;s expected arrival in early 2025. However, the broadcast was still full of annoucements for games headed to Nintendo Switch from other publishers over the coming six months. Here&#x27;s a roundup of everything which appeared during the 25-minute show.
Fresh from Microsoft&#x27;s confirmation it was bringing more of its Xbox console exclusives to other platforms, the show began with a look at Obsidian&#x27;s Grounded - where you have to explore a massive garden as a tiny human. Grounded will support online cross-platform multiplayer on Switch when it&#x27;s released on 16th April.
After this, we entered the dying world of Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist. You take on the role of Lilac as she explores the landscape alongside a homunculus (Fullmetal Alchemist vibes anyone?). Ender Magnolia Bloom will be released on the Nintendo Switch later this year.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s just-finished Nintendo Direct included the surprise announcement of Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble, a new installment in Sega&#x27;s spherical simian series. 


Launching exclusively for Nintendo Switch on 25th June, this new entry in the series features an online mode where up to 16 players can rush forth simultaneously across obstacles and towards each level&#x27;s goal. It looks rather like Fall Guys!


Another big change with Banana Rumble is the addition of a Spin Dash move, which lets you charge forward and skip over short gaps. There&#x27;s a new co-op Adventure Mode, too, and the ability to customise your chimp with over 300 options.

                              <span>And just like that, my excitement for Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has gone from bubbling anticipation to a fever pitch scream; alongside a first gameplay trailer for FromSoftware&#x27;s eagerly awaited expansion, publisher Namco Bandai has now shared a release date, confirming it&#x27;ll be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 21st June.


But first that trailer, offering a full three-minute look at Shadow of the Erdtree, and the sprawling expanses of almost inevitable death and gleefully masochistic misery within. There are fields of wheat tainted with spectral tomb stones, gloomy swamps, and striking ruins high on hills - and what gameplay reveal trailer would be complete without a tease of the imposing enemies that&#x27;ll no doubt be the cause of that aforementioned death and misery?


As for what it&#x27;s all about, well, the specifics remain something of a mystery, although Miquella - long speculated to be the focus of the expansion - while not especially prominent in this reveal (possibly because he&#x27;s currently stuck in an egg), does sort of appear, and there are further hints he&#x27;s maybe not as benevolent as some might claim. Let the lore theorising begin!

                              <span>Monster Hunter Stories, Capcom&#x27;s first - and wonderfully successful - stab at adapting the series&#x27; classic monster battling action into a family friendly turn-based RPG, is, as per today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, getting a Switch remaster sometime this &quot;summer&quot;. Seperately, Capcom has confirmed it&#x27;s coming to PS4 and PC too.


Switch owners have, of course, already had a chance to sample the Monster Hunter Stories series when its acclaimed second outing launched on Nintendo&#x27;s platform in 2021. However, Nintendo&#x27;s latest Direct has revealed the original game - first released for 3DS back in 2016 - is getting a thorough spruce-up for modern audiences.


Monster Hunter Stories 1 casts players as a Monster Rider, setting them loose in a colourful, cartoony rendition of the series&#x27; universe to indulge in some classic RPG-style questing and Pokémon-esque monster collecting, battling, and rearing - and very good it is too.

                              <span>Nintendo will add five classic Rare games to Nintendo Switch today, including SNES hit Killer Instinct and N64 great Blast Corps. 


In Japan, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will also get Mother 3 - the third entry in the legendary Earthbound series which has never made it to the West. 


All of these games were announced in this afternoon&#x27;s Nintendo Direct broadcast - though Mother 3 was only mentioned in the show&#x27;s Japanese version. Sorry, rest of the world.

                              <span>Following last week&#x27;s long-rumoured announcement Microsoft is bringing four of its previously Xbox-exclusive first-party games to Switch and PlayStation 5, we&#x27;ve finally got official confirmation of the first two games making that multiplatform leap: Obsidian&#x27;s historical narrative adventure Pentiment comes to Switch tomorrow, 22nd February, while inch-high garden adventure Grounded arrives 16th April on Nintendo&#x27;s platform.


Starting with Pentiment, it cast players as Andreas Maler, a master artist who finds himself embroiled in murders, scandals, and intrigue over a period of five years in 16th century Bavaria. It&#x27;s fantastic stuff - Eurogamer&#x27;s Christian Donlan called it a &quot;brilliant narrative adventure that is filled with intelligence and heart&quot; in his Recommended review back in November 2022 - and the choice-driven adventure is paired with a striking art style, inspired by the great manuscripts and the earliest printed books of the time.


As for Grounded, Microsoft&#x27;s second Switch-bound Xbox title, it&#x27;s a wonderful co-op-imbued survival and crafting adventure with a distinctly 80s twist, taking a leaf out of cinema favourite Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. As in that movie, Grounded&#x27;s four protagonists are miniaturised and left to fend for themselves in a sprawling backyard garden, building bases and crafting armour to forge ahead against deadly bugs, fish, and other wildlife.

                              <span>Nintendo will hold its next Direct showcase today, Wednesday 20th February at 2pm UK time. 


This showcase will last around 25 minutes, and feature games coming to Nintendo Switch in the first half of 2024 from Nintendo&#x27;s publishing and development partners. Hit refresh on this page at 2pm and you will be able to watch it below!

So, what do we expect? Well, it might be easier to say what we&#x27;re not expecting to pop up here. As this is a partner Direct, don&#x27;t expect any big announcements from Nintendo itself - or from Pokémon, which has its own broadcast scheduled for next week.

                              <span>Xbox boss Phil Spencer has addressed lingering questions around the company stance on physical media following last year&#x27;s leaks of an &quot;adorably all-digital&quot; Xbox Series X refresh, saying Microsoft continues to be &quot;supportive&quot; of the medium, and insisting &quot;getting rid of physical, that&#x27;s not a strategic thing for us.&quot;


An all-digital (and distinctly cylindrical) new Xbox Series X design first surfaced as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year&#x27;s court battle with the FTC over its Activision Blizzard acquisition plans. However, when Spencer later acknowledged the leak, he called its contents &quot;old emails and documents&quot;, insisting that &quot;so much has changed&quot;.


But still, the possibility of an all-digital new Xbox has continued to loom, whether that be a mid-cycle refresh or a future console, particularly following news of major layoffs acoss Microsoft&#x27;s games retail teams. And Spencer has now shed a little more light on Microsoft&#x27;s perspective on physical media as part of an interview for journalist Stephen Totilo&#x27;s Game File.

                              <span>Elden Ring aficionados, it&#x27;s finally almost time to unclench! Just shy of two years since the launch of FromSoftware&#x27;s magisterial open-world action-adventure, publisher Bandai Namco has confirmed it&#x27;ll be sharing more on the game&#x27;s eagerly awaited DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, later today, with early rumours pointing to a June launch.


But first the confirmed stuff; over on its social media channels, Bandai Namco has formally announced Shadow of the Erdtree will be getting a first gameplay reveal as part of a three-minute long YouTube &quot;presentation&quot; today, 21st February, at 3pm UK time/4pm CET/7am PST.


And here we enter into less substantiated territory, with reliable Deallabs leaker billbil-kun (who has an impressive track record when it comes to accurately reporting unannounced PlayStation news) claiming Shadow of the Erdtree will launch on 21st June.

                              <span>Lady Gaga is coming to Fortnite, having famously once asked what &quot;Fortnight&quot; was all about. 


Her arrival in the game marks something of a full-circle moment for the global music megastar, after her social media post in October 2019 simply asking &quot;What&#x27;s Fortnite&quot; went viral. Five years on, Lady Gaga&#x27;s account reposted her original message today with an image of her upcoming in-game character model, and the correction: &quot;*fortnite&quot;.


The image is labelled with Fortnite Festival, which is the game&#x27;s Rock Band/Guitar Hero-style rhythm game mode that launched late last year. Festival&#x27;s second season kicks off this Thursday, 22nd February, following its first season that spotlighted The Weeknd.

The details are fascinating. And if you think it couldn’t happen to you, think again. Given the right set of circumstances, it can.
It happened to Cory Doctorow.</span>

The photos, shared by People, both feature the Academy Award-winning Cate Blanchett - with some very enviable red hair - as infamous outlaw Lilith.
The first photo shows Lilith on her own, looking pretty close to her in-game character.

                              <span>Everywhere developer Build A Rocket Boy has confirmed a round of layoffs at the company, which was founded by ex-Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies in 2016.


An unconfirmed number of job losses were first reported yesterday by PCGamesN. Now, the studio has confirmed &quot;the removal of a number of roles globally&quot; in a statement to Eurogamer.


Build A Rocket Boy is headquartered in Edinburgh, though also operates offices in Budapest, Montpellier and in China. The company is backed by investment from NetEase, and last month completed a further $110m funding round.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced the next wave of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass, which are set to be added to the subscription service over the tail end of February. 


This includes the excellent Tales of Arise, the epic role-playing game from Bandai Namco&#x27;s Tales studio that originally launched to a warm reception back in 2021. &quot;There are missteps and a few bumps along the way, but this soft reboot of a long-running series emerges a triumph,&quot; we wrote in Eurogamer&#x27;s Tales of Arise review.


Younger subscribers (or Xbox Game Pass owners with kids) will likely be keen to know that Bluey: The Video Game comes to the subscription this Thursday, 22nd February. You can explore the Heeler House and playground, plus play keepy uppy and Chattermax Chase.

                              <span>Sony is expected to launch a souped up version of the PlayStation 5 later this year, analysts have suggested.


A new CNBC report notes that there was now &quot;broad concensus in the game industry that Sony is indeed preparing a launch of a PS5 Pro in the second half of 2024,&quot; quoting Tokyo-based games analyst Serkan Toto.


However, the report cautions that Sony is unlikely to see a large uptick in PS5 sales year-on-year as a result of the Pro&#x27;s launch, and is also unlikely to cut the cost of the base PS5 model as a result. (Sony, unsurprsingly, has not commented on CNBC&#x27;s report.)

                              <span>The Need for Speed team is celebrating the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary with another year of live service content for its most recent release, Unbound.
&quot;Surprise! We&#x27;re still here,&quot; developer Criterion Games shared in a new blog post, where it detailed Need for Speed: Unbound&#x27;s year two roadmap. &quot;NFS turns 30 this year, and with that huge legacy, we couldn&#x27;t stand idle. However, this year will be a bit different from the previous one.&quot;
The studio said it hopes players will make &quot;new memories&quot; with the Need for Speed series this year, but admitted it &quot;can&#x27;t build everything everyone wants right now&quot;. What it can do, however, is work with its community to decide what the series should look like in the future.

                              <span>The clever beings at PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab know just how to keep us coming back for more. Not content with tasking us all with scrubbing Tomb Raider&#x27;s Croft Manor or the Seventh Heaven bar from Final Fantasy 7, it is now setting us the challenge of cleaning up the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K.
The PowerWash Simulator Warhammer 40K Special Pack will launch later this month, on 27th February across PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. You can see a little teaser for it in the video below.
We first heard about this Warhammer 40K DLC last year, with the studio subsequently stating we could expect it to release sometime during Q4. This evidently did not happen, but the good news is that there isn&#x27;t much longer to wait now.

                              <span>Cult 90s sci-fi film Starship Troopers has had a bit of a renaissance of late, which has been attributed to the releases of Helldivers 2 on PlayStation and PC.
According to online TV ratings tracker Television Stats, the 1997 release has seen its viewership stats, Wikipedia rank, and IMDB rank all see a significant rise over recent days.
A quick browse through social media will see several posts linking this renewed interest in Starship Troopers with the release of Helldivers 2 earlier this month, and this hasn&#x27;t passed the game director by. Sharing some stats on X showing an increase in Starship Troopers&#x27; popularity, Johan Pilestedt said: &quot;This is incredible!&quot;

The option essentially lets you try a permadeath run of the full game, which will end if main character Basim dies or commits any illegal actions (ie. killing civilians) that would normally see you kicked out of the Animus. 


Full Synchronisation Mode will become available when you install today&#x27;s patch 1.0.7 for Mirage, which launches at around 1pm UK time.

                              <span>A new Pokémon Presents digital event will broadcast next week, on Tuesday 27th January at 2pm UK time. That&#x27;s 9am Eastern or 6am Pacific.


The showcase will contain &quot;exciting news&quot;, a post on social media today teased, without going into further detail. 


We&#x27;re expecting to hear from The Pokémon Company on what the next Pokémon project to launch will likely be - and while it feels too early for a new generation of Pokémon, following 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it seems likely that some sort of game will arrive in the next 12 months.

                              <span>The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that breaking end-to-end encryption by adding backdoors violates human rights:
Seemingly most critically, the [Russian] government told the ECHR that any intrusion on private lives resulting from decrypting messages was “necessary” to combat terrorism in a democratic society. To back up this claim, the government pointed to a 2017 terrorist attack that was “coordinated from abroad through secret chats via Telegram.” The government claimed that a second terrorist attack that year was prevented after the government discovered it was being coordinated through Telegram chats...</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 won Game of the Year at the DICE Awards last week, and unlike at The Game Awards, the developers were actually allowed to take some time with their acceptance speech. And let it be known, Larian used that time wisely, addressing both the current state of the industry and the importance of player experience. 


When Larian&#x27;s director of publishing Michael Douse took to the stage, he acknowledged that while this is a &quot;really human industry&quot; it can also be very &quot;bad sometimes at showing developers what they&#x27;re worth&quot;. He then discussed the wave of layoffs that have affected so many people and game development studios over the past year.


&quot;I want you all to know that you are talented and that you matter, and that you are the future of this industry. Don&#x27;t let that flame be extinguished by our collective mistakes,&quot; Douse said. &quot;I know everyone here is scared because shit&#x27;s really fucked up.&quot;

                              <span>UPDATE 4.45pm UK: Consider me educated. I have looked into this further, and it turns out not only is Trinity the name of the military order in the rebooted Tomb Raider games, but it is also the code name for the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, which was conducted by the United States Army back in 1945. And that could be what the Tomb Raider website is referring to. Whoops! 

So, yes, the mention of Trinity on the Tomb Raider site may well be a coincidence that left the super fan in me a little too enthusiastic. Reader, I confess, I may have jumped the gun a bit here. I am going to send a message to the Tomb Raider team though and ask if they have any comment on the wording in the blog post, because my curiosity has now been piqued even more.

                              <span>Capcom has shared a post to celebrate the eighth anniversary of Street Fighter 5, where it apologised for the game&#x27;s original state at launch.


&quot;From the beginning to the middle of the release, there were network issues, lack of content, etc... We are truly sorry for the content that did not meet the expectations of many of you,&quot; Capcom&#x27;s Japanese Street Fighter social media account shared over the weekend. 


This is something we touched on in our own Street Fighter 5 review from 2016. As we said at the time: &quot;Street Fighter 5&#x27;s brilliant combat is let down by a barebones launch and server troubles.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo shares have dropped slightly from a record high last week, following reports the company has internally delayed its expected Switch 2 release window into 2025.


Eurogamer reported last Friday that Nintendo was now looking to launch Switch 2 in early 2025, a change from previous, unannounced plans that had the new console pegged for later this year. Sources with knowledge of the delay told us it was designed to ensure the strongest possible line-up of launch games.

Bloomberg later corroborated the news via its own sources, and today noted Nintendo shares had now fallen 5.8 percent on the back of Switch 2&#x27;s delay being made public. Nintendo is yet to comment on the reports.

                              <span>A Limp Bizkit mod for Fallout: New Vegas once thought lost has now been rediscovered.
The mod in question added Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst as an in-game companion. And, of course, he brought some nu metal energy with him, as he only spoke in lyrics from the band&#x27;s discography. All very standard modding community stuff.
However, the mod had a very short shelf-life on Nexus Mods when it was first released around seven years ago, and there was very little evidence of it left online - an old Reddit post and YouTube video (which you can see below), were about all that remained.

                              <span>PlayStation-published Helldivers 2 had a hugely successful weekend on Steam, despite some continuing server issues, with a fresh player peak of 409,367 users yesterday. 


That&#x27;s a new record for Helldivers 2, according to official Steam figures, and puts the game&#x27;s all-time player peak  higher than Steam stalwarts such as GTA5, Rust and Destiny 2. 


To say that Helldivers has been a hit on PC would be something of an understatement, especially in comparison to the middling popularity of some other PlayStation PC launches.

                              <span>The Convergence mod for Elden Ring is out now, offering an &quot;exhaustive overhaul&quot; of the game.


Available on NexusMods, The Convergence makes major changes from the very beginning of the game. Now players will need to choose from one of 27 new classes - each with its own unique progression path - that will determine the player&#x27;s starting location in the world.



The original game features 10 classes, but these are starting points from which the player has freedom to develop in any direction. The Convergence, then, has a more formal structure for players to follow that cements typical builds.

                              <span>The upcoming return of Crazy Taxi will be a &quot;AAA&quot; game, Sega has said. 

Sega first announced it was making a long-awaited new Crazy Taxi title in December last year, as part of a new wave of entries in many of its classic series.


Now, a Japan Times interview has shed more light on its scope, and revealed it is being worked on in part by Sega&#x27;s relatively new Sapporo Studio, which was founded in the capital of Japan&#x27;s Hokkaido prefecture in December 2021.

                              <span>Despite claims it is a &quot;quadruple-A&quot; live-service experience, Skull and Bones&#x27;s user Metacritic score has taken a pummelling since the pirate ship game was released on Friday, 16th February.
Based on the 222 user scores recorded to date, Skull and Bones&#x27; user score is sitting at just 2.8 out of 10, making it the lowest-rated game of 2024 released thus far when ranked by user score alone.
Complaints are centred chiefly around its &quot;underwhelming and lacklustre&quot; gameplay, a &quot;poorly designed&quot; end game, and claims that it is &quot;boring&quot;, with many players comparing it unfavourably to Sea of Thieves and even Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Black Flag, the latter of which is now 11 years old.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead says it has had to &quot;cap&quot; concurrent players to around 450,000 to &quot;further improve server stability&quot;.
In a message posted to the game&#x27;s Discord community, the team said it was &quot;working around the clock to solve&quot; the issue, and whilst it&#x27;s been able to &quot;mitigate&quot; some of the causes, it was &quot;still struggling to keep up with the scaling that is needed&quot;.
&quot;Earlier tonight we had server-related issues with a concurrent player spike,&quot; the team said. &quot;This lead [sic] to some mission payouts failing, some players being kicked to their ships, or being logged out.

                              <span>It looks like a demo for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 could be on the way.
According to a recent Steam update – and spotted by the eagle-eyed community on the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma subreddit – an update to Steam&#x27;s backend hints that a mysterious &quot;unknown app&quot; was added to Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s Steam listing.
Furthermore, the app has been listed as &quot;free on demand&quot;, which is often the text appended to Steam demos.

                              <span>DreadXP has confirmed its upcoming retro psychological survival horror game, Heartworm, will be released in 2025.
Designed for people who &quot;love early console-era survival horror games with cinematic fixed camera angles and low-fidelity visuals&quot;, Heartworm is described as &quot;a nostalgia-wrapped nightmare with a compelling narrative that tackles themes of grief and obsession, supported by a haunting soundtrack, surreal visuals, and pre-rendered cutscenes&quot;.
Heartworm developer Vincent Adinolfi had originally hoped to release Heartworm this year, but after losing its publisher, launching a Kickstarter, cancelling a Kickstarter, and then finding a new publisher in DreadXP, Adinolfi says &quot;with the delays we have had there&#x27;s no choice but to push things back - I hope you can understand&quot;.

Following a pledge to give all players a 50 per cent XP and requisition bonus to compensate for &quot;a problem&quot; that&#x27;s giving out incorrect rewards at the end of missions, Helldivers 2&#x27;s concurrent Steam count continues to tick up, which has, in turn, seemingly had a significant impact on server stability.
&quot;Despite our best efforts to increase server capacity to accommodate all of you who want to dive for Freedom, we are experiencing capacity issues,&quot; the team said in a statement posted to X/Twitter over the weekend.

Courtesy of the game&#x27;s recently-launched cross-play and cross-save systems, players will be able to use – and switch between – platforms, which DE says offers the &quot;same expansive, high-quality&quot; experience on Apple devices as it does on PC and consoles.
Players can access their Tenno collection across the platforms, whilst new arrivals will be able to claim &quot;Day 1&quot; login rewards.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is awarding all players a 50 per cent XP and requisition bonus to compensate players for &quot;a problem&quot; that&#x27;s preventing players from receiving the correct rewards at the end of missions.
In a statement posted to X/Twitter, deputy game director Sagar explained that whilst the team was still &quot;working on a fix for this&quot;, it wanted to &quot;alleviate the impact&quot; for players jumping into the action over the weekend.
That means that between now and the end of Sunday central European time (11pm UK time / 6pm EST / 3pm PST), players can expect an additional XP bonus on top of the base mission score.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair insists it has no reason to be alarmed about the hit game&#x27;s dwindling player count.
As Palworld&#x27;s 24-hour concurrent Steam count peaks at around 535,000 players – a fair fall from the 2.1 million simultaneous players Pocketpair secured the weekend Palworld launched – community manager &quot;Bucky&quot; stated in a statement on Twitter that the &quot;Palworld has lost X per cent of its player base discourse is lazy&quot;, insisting that it was &quot;fine&quot; for players to take a break and play other games in between content updates.
&quot;This emerging &#x27;Palworld has lost X per cent of its player base&#x27; discourse is lazy, but it&#x27;s probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games,&quot; Bucky said.

In a statement posted to the official website, Rocksteady said it could &quot;hear and feel your frustration&quot; about the ongoing issues, and agreed it was &quot;unacceptable for the players&quot; affected by the persistent problems, but said that because the issues didn&#x27;t stem from one particular issue, it was &quot;several smaller issues affecting players in different ways&quot;.
&quot;For our upcoming patches we are looking to address login issues and server issues,&quot; the statement, signed &quot;Axel and the Rocksteady Team&quot; said. &quot;And while we might not be able to fix all of those issues right away, I want to assure everyone: This is the top priority for us. We hear and feel your frustration and we can only agree, it’s unacceptable for the players who are affected by this.

The strike, organised by French game workers union STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo), took place on 14th February across Ubisoft&#x27;s Paris, Montpellier, Annecy, Lyon, and Bordeaux studios. The STJV had called for action at the start of this month, saying annual salary negotiations had reached an unsatisfactory conclusion.


&quot;In recent weeks,&quot; the STJV wrote in a statement shared at the time, &quot;Mandatory Annual Negotiations on salaries have taken place in several Ubisoft entities in France, and the STJV was obviously present. Despite concerted efforts by union organisations to find an acceptable compromise, negotiations hit a wall.&quot;

                              <span>A report claiming Nintendo Switch 2 will now launch in Q1 2025 is spreading online. 


Brazilian games journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe has stated Nintendo is now looking to release its next console in early 2025, though still within the 2024 financial year. The report is based on development sources now targeting that quarter for launch.


Eurogamer has heard similar whispers of an early 2025 launch from industry sources this week, though has not been able to concretely substantiate them. Nintendo Switch 2 had previously been widely tipped to arrive later this year. A move to the other side of Christmas into early 2025 would mean more time for the console&#x27;s launch line-up to be readied, while keeping the financial benefit of Switch 2&#x27;s launch within Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming financial calendar.

                              <span>Palworld developer Pocketpair has acknowledged the significant impact &quot;cheating and the influence of fraudulent activities&quot; is having on rule-abiding players of its hugely popular survival game, and has outlined some of the steps it&#x27;ll be taking - including the introduction of an &quot;external anti-cheat solution&quot; - to tackle the problem.


Writing in a post shared on Steam, Pocketpair admitted that, while the studio has been &quot;dealing with each issue on a daily basis and taking measures&quot;, there are &quot;many cases where we are not able to keep up&quot; with cheating and fraudulent activities - leading, it acknowledged, to &quot;some players [being] unable to play the game properly.&quot;


Pocketpair apologised for &quot;any inconvenience this may cause&quot; and - expanding on a recent tweet promising a cheating-related patch &quot;soon&quot; - revealed it&#x27;s currently working on a number of specific measures to deal with cheating and fraudulent activity &quot;strictly and as a priority&quot;.

                              <span>This week on the Eurogamer Newscast, we discuss Microsoft&#x27;s business update that brought us confirmation Xbox will launch four console exclusives - for now - on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.
But why did Microsoft choose not to name those four games (even though Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Grounded and Sea of Thieves were immediately reported to be the titles in question)? What happened to the previously-reported plans to include larger games such as Starfield? And where will Microsoft draw the line for what to launch elsewhere? Right now, these four feel like something of a soft launch for Microsoft&#x27;s multiplatform strategy, 
As well as all that, we also discuss the news nuggets Microsoft dropped for the Xbox faithful - including mention of new Xbox console hardware this year and the proper next-gen Xbox that&#x27;s still years away. With me this week are Eurogamer&#x27;s Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Liv Ngan.

                              <span>One of the three upcoming Star Wars games in development at Apex Legends and Titanfall studio Respawn is reportedly a bounty hunter game where you play as a Mandalorian. 


That&#x27;s according to Insider Gaming, which said the project was still in the early stages of development, but was a first-person shooter starring a Mandalorian bounty hunter during the time of the Galactic Empire.


The report stops short of confirming the Mandalorian bounty hunter as Din Djarin, star of Disney+ hit TV series and upcoming Mandalorian movie. A time period set during the height of the Galactic Empire would also place the game prior to the TV series - making a Baby Yoda appearance unlikely.

The information comes from the company&#x27;s latest financial report for Q3 of FY2024, which  contained changes to its projections of profits and sales for the full fiscal year.
The Tekken 8 and Elden Ring publisher lowered its projections for profits due to &quot;valuation losses&quot;. These losses include &quot;loss on disposal of titles following a review of the composition of the titles within the next mid-term plan in mind&quot;, the company stated in its report.

Patch 6 has been teased by Larian Studios since last week, when we learned it would include more kissing animations and easier party management, but we didn&#x27;t know when it would be rolling out - or everything else it would contain.
Well, the update is now live, and with it comes the usual delight of patch notes a la Larian, which are too lengthy to be contained in Steam&#x27;s character limit (of course).

XProger is the brains behind OpenLara, an open-source cross-platform engine of the classic Tomb Raider series. However, this project and others are now on hold, as XProger was scooped up by Aspyr&#x27;s parent company Saber Interactive to work on its official Tomb Raider project.


&quot;For the past year I&#x27;ve been busy with a dream project that has become the culmination of the last eight years of my life - Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered,&quot; XProger shared on X, thanking Saber for &quot;trusting me to lead the project and assemble a dream team of true fans&quot;.

                              <span>Payday 3 will finally be getting an offline mode - although we don&#x27;t know exactly when.
Payday 3 hasn&#x27;t exactly had the best of launches. It was plagued with matchmaking issues and online-only requirements on release, and subsequent patches were delayed. All this lead to developer Starbreeze admitting that sales and player activity were lower than it had hoped, but it would endeavour to turn this around with a series of prioritised improvements.
Now, we know more about what these upcoming improvements will be, thanks to the reveal of Operation Medic Bag. Here, the developer announced that an offline mode is coming to Payday 3, as well an overhaul to matchmaking (Starbreeze admitted that right now, &quot;matchmaking isn&#x27;t doing a good job of bringing people together&quot;), tweaks to the UI, a solo mode and a quickplay option. Additionally, &quot;challenges will be removed&quot;, with the developer stating it will &quot;switch infamy progression to be tied to heist completion&quot;.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestedt is hoping the game&#x27;s second weekend will go much smoother than its first.
In a thread posted on X, Pilestedt reflected on the changes developer Arrowhead Game Studios has made since Helldivers 2 released to huge success on 8th February for PC and PlayStation 5.
&quot;I am completely exhausted by the success,&quot; he stated, but &quot;very, very pleased.&quot;

                              <span>As Microsoft opts to launch at least some of its Xbox exclusives on rival consoles, the company&#x27;s gaming boss Phil Spencer has reflected on Sony&#x27;s recent, hugely-successful launch of online, cross-platform shooter Helldivers 2 on PC and PlayStation 5.


&quot;I will say, when I look at a game like Helldivers 2 - and it&#x27;s a great game, kudos to the team shipping on PC and PlayStation - I&#x27;m not exactly sure who it helps in the industry by not being on Xbox,&quot; Spencer told Game File. &quot;If you try to twist yourself to say, like, somehow that benefited somebody somewhere.


&quot;But I get it. There&#x27;s a legacy in console gaming that we&#x27;re going to benefit by shipping games and not putting them on other places. We do the same thing.&quot;

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is developer Remedy&#x27;s fastest-selling game to date, but the studio is still to recuperate the project&#x27;s development and marketing costs. 


In its latest financial report, Remedy said Alan Wake 2 had now sold 1.3m units, with 1m of those occurring by the end of last year. This equates to 50 percent more copies and over three times more digital copies of Alan Wake 2 sold in the game&#x27;s first two months than its previous release Control managed in its first four months (though it&#x27;s worth noting Alan Wake 2 was a digital-only release).


Control has since gone on to sell over 4m units, and Remedy said it expected a similar trend with Alan Wake 2, as &quot;a great game can generate excellent long tail sales&quot;. But, of course, games lose value over time - so copies sold after prices drop generate less revenue than at launch.
